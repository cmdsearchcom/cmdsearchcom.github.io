<p>PERL5200DELTA(1) Perl Programmers Reference Guide
PERL5200DELTA(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
perl5200delta - what is new for perl v5.20.0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This document describes differences between the 5.18.0
release and the 5.20.0 release.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are upgrading from an
earlier release such as 5.16.0, first read perl5180delta,
which describes differences between 5.16.0 and 5.18.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Core Enhancements <br>
Experimental Subroutine signatures <br>
Declarative syntax to unwrap argument list into lexical
variables. &quot;sub foo ($a,$b) {...}&quot; checks the
number of arguments and puts the arguments into lexical
variables. <br>
Signatures are not equivalent to the existing idiom of
&quot;sub foo { my($a,$b) = @_; ... }&quot;. Signatures are
only available by enabling a non-default feature, and
generate warnings <br>
about being experimental. The syntactic clash with
prototypes is managed by disabling the short prototype
syntax when signatures are enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See &quot;Signatures&quot; in
perlsub for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;sub&quot;s now take a
&quot;prototype&quot; attribute <br>
When declaring or defining a &quot;sub&quot;, the prototype
can now be specified inside of a &quot;prototype&quot;
attribute instead of in parens following the name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, &quot;sub
foo($$){}&quot; could be rewritten as &quot;sub foo :
prototype($$){}&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">More consistent prototype
parsing <br>
Multiple semicolons in subroutine prototypes have long been
tolerated and treated as a single semicolon. There was one
case where this did not happen. A subroutine whose <br>
prototype begins with &quot;*&quot; or &quot;;*&quot; can
affect whether a bareword is considered a method name or sub
call. This now applies also to &quot;;;;*&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Whitespace has long been allowed
inside subroutine prototypes, so &quot;sub( $ $ )&quot; is
equivalent to &quot;sub($$)&quot;, but until now it was
stripped when the subroutine was parsed. Hence, <br>
whitespace was not allowed in prototypes set by
&quot;Scalar::Util::set_prototype&quot;. Now it is
permitted, and the parser no longer strips whitespace. This
means &quot;prototype &amp;mysub&quot; <br>
returns the original prototype, whitespace and all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;rand&quot; now uses a
consistent random number generator <br>
Previously perl would use a platform specific random number
generator, varying between the libc rand(), random() or
drand48().</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This meant that the quality of
perl&rsquo;s random numbers would vary from platform to
platform, from the 15 bits of rand() on Windows to 48-bits
on POSIX platforms such as Linux with <br>
drand48().</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl now uses its own internal
drand48() implementation on all platforms. This does not
make perl&rsquo;s &quot;rand&quot; cryptographically secure.
[perl #115928]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">New slice syntax <br>
The new %hash{...} and %array[...] syntax returns a list of
key/value (or index/value) pairs. See &quot;Key/Value Hash
Slices&quot; in perldata.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Experimental Postfix
Dereferencing <br>
When the &quot;postderef&quot; feature is in effect, the
following syntactical equivalencies are set up:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$sref-&gt;$*; # same as ${ $sref
} # interpolates <br>
$aref-&gt;@*; # same as @{ $aref } # interpolates <br>
$href-&gt;%*; # same as %{ $href } <br>
$cref-&gt;&amp;*; # same as &amp;{ $cref } <br>
$gref-&gt;**; # same as *{ $gref }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$aref-&gt;$#*; # same as $#{
$aref }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$gref-&gt;*{ $slot }; # same as
*{ $gref }{ $slot }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$aref-&gt;@[ ... ]; # same as
@$aref[ ... ] # interpolates <br>
$href-&gt;@{ ... }; # same as @$href{ ... } # interpolates
<br>
$aref-&gt;%[ ... ]; # same as %$aref[ ... ] <br>
$href-&gt;%{ ... }; # same as %$href{ ... }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Those marked as interpolating
only interpolate if the associated &quot;postderef_qq&quot;
feature is also enabled. This feature is experimental and
will trigger <br>
&quot;experimental::postderef&quot;-category warnings when
used, unless they are suppressed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For more information, consult
the Postfix Dereference Syntax section of perlref.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unicode 6.3 now supported <br>
Perl now supports and is shipped with Unicode 6.3 (though
Perl may be recompiled with any previous Unicode release as
well). A detailed list of Unicode 6.3 changes is at <br>
&lt;http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode6.3.0/&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">New &quot;{Unicode}&quot;
regular expression pattern property <br>
This is a synonym for &quot;{Any}&quot; and matches the set
of Unicode-defined code points 0 - 0x10FFFF.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Better 64-bit support <br>
On 64-bit platforms, the internal array functions now use
64-bit offsets, allowing Perl arrays to hold more than 2**31
elements, if you have the memory available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The regular expression engine
now supports strings longer than 2**31 characters. [perl
#112790, #116907]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The functions PerlIO_get_bufsiz,
PerlIO_get_cnt, PerlIO_set_cnt and PerlIO_set_ptrcnt now
have SSize_t, rather than int, return values and
parameters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;use locale&quot; now works
on UTF-8 locales <br>
Until this release, only single-byte locales, such as the
ISO 8859 series were supported. Now, the increasingly common
multi-byte UTF-8 locales are also supported. A UTF-8 <br>
locale is one in which the character set is Unicode and the
encoding is UTF-8. The POSIX &quot;LC_CTYPE&quot; category
operations (case changing (like &quot;lc()&quot;,
&quot;U&quot;), and character <br>
classification (&quot;48qr/[[:punct:]]/&quot;)) under such a
locale work just as if not under locale, but instead as if
under &quot;use feature &rsquo;unicode_strings&rsquo;&quot;,
except taint rules <br>
are followed. Sorting remains by code point order in this
release. [perl #56820].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;use locale&quot; now
compiles on systems without locale ability <br>
Previously doing this caused the program to not compile.
Within its scope the program behaves as if in the
&quot;C&quot; locale. Thus programs written for platforms
that support locales <br>
can run on locale-less platforms without change. Attempts to
change the locale away from the &quot;C&quot; locale will,
of course, fail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">More locale initialization
fallback options <br>
If there was an error with locales during Perl start-up, it
immediately gave up and tried to use the &quot;C&quot;
locale. Now it first tries using other locales given by the
environment <br>
variables, as detailed in &quot;ENVIRONMENT&quot; in
perllocale. For example, if &quot;LC_ALL&quot; and
&quot;LANG&quot; are both set, and using the
&quot;LC_ALL&quot; locale fails, Perl will now try the
&quot;LANG&quot; <br>
locale, and only if that fails, will it fall back to
&quot;C&quot;. On Windows machines, Perl will try, ahead of
using &quot;C&quot;, the system default locale if all the
locales given by <br>
environment variables fail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;-DL&quot; runtime option
now added for tracing locale setting <br>
This is designed for Perl core developers to aid in field
debugging bugs regarding locales.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F now implies -a and -a implies
-n <br>
Previously -F without -a was a no-op, and -a without -n or
-p was a no-op, with this change, if you supply -F then both
-a and -n are implied and if you supply -a then -n is <br>
implied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can still use -p for its
extra behaviour. [perl #116190]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$a and $b warnings exemption
<br>
The special variables $a and $b, used in &quot;sort&quot;,
are now exempt from &quot;used once&quot; warnings, even
where &quot;sort&quot; is not used. This makes it easier for
CPAN modules to provide <br>
functions using $a and $b for similar purposes. [perl
#120462]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Security <br>
Avoid possible read of free()d memory during parsing <br>
It was possible that free()d memory could be read during
parsing in the unusual circumstance of the Perl program
ending with a heredoc and the last line of the file on disk
<br>
having no terminating newline character. This has now been
fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Incompatible Changes <br>
&quot;do&quot; can no longer be used to call subroutines
<br>
The &quot;do SUBROUTINE(LIST)&quot; form has resulted in a
deprecation warning since Perl v5.0.0, and is now a syntax
error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Quote-like escape changes <br>
The character after &quot; i s n o w <br>
A literal &quot;{&quot; after &quot;0f a t a l .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These were deprecated in perl
v5.14.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tainting happens under more
circumstances; now conforms to documentation <br>
This affects regular expression matching and changing the
case of a string (&quot;lc&quot;, &quot;U&quot;, etc.)
within the scope of &quot;use locale&quot;. The result is
now tainted based on the operation, <br>
no matter what the contents of the string were, as the
documentation (perlsec, &quot;SECURITY&quot; in perllocale)
indicates it should. Previously, for the case change
operation, if the <br>
string contained no characters whose case change could be
affected by the locale, the result would not be tainted. For
example, the result of &quot;uc()&quot; on an empty string
or one <br>
containing only above-Latin1 code points is now tainted, and
wasn&rsquo;t before. This leads to more consistent tainting
results. Regular expression patterns taint their non-binary
<br>
results (like $&amp;, $2) if and only if the pattern
contains elements whose matching depends on the current
(potentially tainted) locale. Like the case changing
functions, the <br>
actual contents of the string being matched now do not
matter, whereas formerly it did. For example, if the pattern
contains a &quot;984 <br>
match did not have to use that portion of the pattern to
succeed or fail, because what a &quot;1272.&quot; in a
pattern will not enable <br>
tainting, because the dot matches any single character, and
what the current locale is doesn&rsquo;t change in any way
what matches and what doesn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;{}&quot;, &quot;P{}&quot;
matching has changed for non-Unicode code points. <br>
&quot;{}&quot; and &quot;P{}&quot; are defined by Unicode
only on Unicode-defined code points (&quot;U+0000&quot;
through &quot;U+10FFFF&quot;). Their behavior on matching
these legal Unicode code points is <br>
unchanged, but there are changes for code points 0x110000
and above. Previously, Perl treated the result of matching
&quot;{}&quot; and &quot;P{}&quot; against these as
&quot;undef&quot;, which translates <br>
into &quot;false&quot;. For &quot;P{}&quot;, this was then
complemented into &quot;true&quot;. A warning was supposed
to be raised when this happened. However, various
optimizations could prevent the <br>
warning, and the results were often counter-intuitive, with
both a match and its seeming complement being false. Now all
non-Unicode code points are treated as typical <br>
unassigned Unicode code points. This generally is more
Do-What-I-Mean. A warning is raised only if the results are
arguably different from a strict Unicode approach, and from
<br>
what Perl used to do. Code that needs to be strictly Unicode
compliant can make this warning fatal, and then Perl always
raises the warning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Details are in &quot;Beyond
Unicode code points&quot; in perlunicode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;{All}&quot; has been
expanded to match all possible code points <br>
The Perl-defined regular expression pattern element
&quot;{All}&quot;, unused on CPAN, used to match just the
Unicode code points; now it matches all possible code
points; that is, it is <br>
equivalent to &quot;qr/./s&quot;. Thus &quot;{All}&quot; is
no longer synonymous with &quot;{Any}&quot;, which continues
to match just the Unicode code points, as Unicode says it
should.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Data::Dumper&rsquo;s output may
change <br>
Depending on the data structures dumped and the settings set
for Data::Dumper, the dumped output may have changed from
previous versions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you have tests that depend on
the exact output of Data::Dumper, they may fail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To avoid this problem in your
code, test against the data structure from evaluating the
dumped structure, instead of the dump itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Locale decimal point character
no longer leaks outside of &quot;use locale&quot; scope <br>
This is actually a bug fix, but some code has come to rely
on the bug being present, so this change is listed here. The
current locale that the program is running under is not <br>
supposed to be visible to Perl code except within the scope
of a &quot;use locale&quot;. However, until now under
certain circumstances, the character used for a decimal
point (often a <br>
comma) leaked outside the scope. If your code is affected by
this change, simply add a &quot;use locale&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Assignments of Windows sockets
error codes to $! now prefer errno.h values over
WSAGetLastError() values <br>
In previous versions of Perl, Windows sockets error codes as
returned by WSAGetLastError() were assigned to $!, and some
constants such as ECONNABORTED, not in errno.h in VC++ <br>
(or the various Windows ports of gcc) were defined to
corresponding WSAE* values to allow $! to be tested against
the E* constants exported by Errno and POSIX.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This worked well until VC++ 2010
and later, which introduced new E* constants with values
&gt; 100 into errno.h, including some being (re)defined by
perl to WSAE* values. That <br>
caused problems when linking XS code against other libraries
which used the original definitions of errno.h
constants.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To avoid this incompatibility,
perl now maps WSAE* error codes to E* values where possible,
and assigns those values to $!. The E* constants exported by
Errno and POSIX are <br>
updated to match so that testing $! against them, wherever
previously possible, will continue to work as expected, and
all E* constants found in errno.h are now exported from <br>
those modules with their original errno.h values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to avoid breakage in
existing Perl code which assigns WSAE* values to $!, perl
now intercepts the assignment and performs the same mapping
to E* values as it uses <br>
internally when assigning to $! itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, one
backwards-incompatibility remains: existing Perl code which
compares $! against the numeric values of the WSAE* error
codes that were previously assigned to $! will <br>
now be broken in those cases where a corresponding E* value
has been assigned instead. This is only an issue for those
E* values &lt; 100, which were always exported from Errno
and <br>
POSIX with their original errno.h values, and therefore
could not be used for WSAE* error code tests (e.g. WSAEINVAL
is 10022, but the corresponding EINVAL is 22). (E* values
&gt; <br>
100, if present, were redefined to WSAE* values anyway, so
compatibility can be achieved by using the E* constants,
which will work both before and after this change, albeit
<br>
using different numeric values under the hood.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Functions
&quot;PerlIO_vsprintf&quot; and &quot;PerlIO_sprintf&quot;
have been removed <br>
These two functions, undocumented, unused in CPAN, and
problematic, have been removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Deprecations <br>
The &quot;/character class <br>
The &quot;/regular expression character class is deprecated.
From perl 5.22 onwards it will generate a warning, and from
perl 5.24 onwards it will be a regular expression <br>
compiler error. If you need to examine the individual bytes
that make up a UTF8-encoded character, then use
&quot;utf8::encode()&quot; on the string (or a copy)
first.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Literal control characters in
variable names <br>
This deprecation affects things like $ originally this was
intended as the canonical way of accessing variables like
$^T, with the caret form only being added as an
alternative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The literal control form is
being deprecated for two main reasons. It has what are
likely unfixable bugs, such as $ portable to non-ASCII
platforms: While $^T will work everywhere, <br>
References to non-integers and non-positive integers in $/
<br>
Setting $/ to a reference to zero or a reference to a
negative integer is now deprecated, and will behave exactly
as though it was set to &quot;undef&quot;. If you want slurp
behavior set <br>
$/ to &quot;undef&quot; explicitly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Setting $/ to a reference to a
non integer is now forbidden and will throw an error. Perl
has never documented what would happen in this context and
while it used to behave the <br>
same as setting $/ to the address of the references in
future it may behave differently, so we have forbidden this
usage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Character matching routines in
POSIX <br>
Use of any of these functions in the &quot;POSIX&quot;
module is now deprecated: &quot;isalnum&quot;,
&quot;isalpha&quot;, &quot;iscntrl&quot;,
&quot;isdigit&quot;, &quot;isgraph&quot;,
&quot;islower&quot;, &quot;isprint&quot;,
&quot;ispunct&quot;, &quot;isspace&quot;, <br>
&quot;isupper&quot;, and &quot;isxdigit&quot;. The functions
are buggy and don&rsquo;t work on UTF-8 encoded strings. See
their entries in POSIX for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A warning is raised on the first
call to any of them from each place in the code that they
are called. (Hence a repeated statement in a loop will raise
just the one warning.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Interpreter-based threads are
now discouraged <br>
The &quot;interpreter-based threads&quot; provided by Perl
are not the fast, lightweight system for multitasking that
one might expect or hope for. Threads are implemented in a
way that <br>
make them easy to misuse. Few people know how to use them
correctly or will be able to provide help.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The use of interpreter-based
threads in perl is officially discouraged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Module removals <br>
The following modules will be removed from the core
distribution in a future release, and will at that time need
to be installed from CPAN. Distributions on CPAN which
require <br>
these modules will need to list them as prerequisites.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The core versions of these
modules will now issue &quot;deprecated&quot;-category
warnings to alert you to this fact. To silence these
deprecation warnings, install the modules in <br>
question from CPAN.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the planned removal of
these modules from core does not reflect a judgement about
the quality of the code and should not be taken as a
suggestion that their use be <br>
halted. Their disinclusion from core primarily hinges on
their necessity to bootstrapping a fully functional,
CPAN-capable Perl installation, not on concerns over their
design.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CGI and its associated CGI::
packages <br>
inc::latest <br>
Package::Constants <br>
Module::Build and its associated Module::Build::
packages</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Utility removals <br>
The following utilities will be removed from the core
distribution in a future release, and will at that time need
to be installed from CPAN.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">find2perl <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Performance Enhancements <br>
&Acirc;&middot; Perl has a new copy-on-write mechanism that
avoids the need to copy the internal string buffer when
assigning from one scalar to another. This makes copying
large strings <br>
appear much faster. Modifying one of the two (or more)
strings after an assignment will force a copy internally.
This makes it unnecessary to pass strings by reference for
<br>
efficiency.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This feature was already
available in 5.18.0, but wasn&rsquo;t enabled by default. It
is the default now, and so you no longer need build perl
with the Configure argument:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Accflags=-DPERL_NEW_COPY_ON_WRITE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It can be disabled (for now) in
a perl build with:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Accflags=-DPERL_NO_COW</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On some operating systems Perl
can be compiled in such a way that any attempt to modify
string buffers shared by multiple SVs will crash. This way
XS authors can test that <br>
their modules handle copy-on-write scalars correctly. See
&quot;Copy on Write&quot; in perlguts for detail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Perl has an
optimizer for regular expression patterns. It analyzes the
pattern to find things such as the minimum length a string
has to be to match, etc. It now better <br>
handles code points that are above the Latin1 range.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Executing a
regex that contains the &quot;^&quot; anchor (or its variant
under the &quot;/m&quot; flag) has been made much faster in
several situations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Precomputed hash
values are now used in more places during method lookup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Constant hash
key lookups ($hash{key} as opposed to $hash{$key}) have long
had the internal hash value computed at compile time, to
speed up lookup. This optimisation has <br>
only now been applied to hash slices as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Combined
&quot;and&quot; and &quot;or&quot; operators in void
context, like those generated for &quot;unless ($a
&amp;&amp; $b)&quot; and &quot;if ($a || b)&quot; now short
circuit directly to the end of the statement. <br>
[perl #120128]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; In certain
situations, when &quot;return&quot; is the last statement in
a subroutine&rsquo;s main scope, it will be optimized out.
This means code like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sub baz { return $cat; }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will now behave like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sub baz { $cat; }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">which is notably faster.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[perl #120765]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Code like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">my $x; # or @x, %x <br>
my $y;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">is now optimized to:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">my ($x, $y);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In combination with the padrange
optimization introduced in v5.18.0, this means longer
uninitialized my variable statements are also optimized,
so:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">my $x; my @y; my %z;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">becomes:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">my ($x, @y, %z);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[perl #121077]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The creation of
certain sorts of lists, including array and hash slices, is
now faster.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The optimisation
for arrays indexed with a small constant integer is now
applied for integers in the range -128..127, rather than
0..255. This should speed up Perl code using <br>
expressions like $x[-1], at the expense of (presumably much
rarer) code using expressions like $x[200].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The first
iteration over a large hash (using &quot;keys&quot; or
&quot;each&quot;) is now faster. This is achieved by
preallocating the hash&rsquo;s internal iterator state,
rather than lazily <br>
creating it when the hash is first iterated. (For small
hashes, the iterator is still created only when first
needed. The assumption is that small hashes are more likely
to <br>
be used as objects, and therefore never allocated. For large
hashes, that&rsquo;s less likely to be true, and the cost of

changes have been made to reflect changes made to the perl
internals in this release.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; New sections on
Read-Only Values and Copy on Write have been added.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perlhack</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The Super Quick
Patch Guide section has been updated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perlhacktips</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The
documentation has been updated to include some more examples
of &quot;gdb&quot; usage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perllexwarn</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The perllexwarn
documentation used to describe the hierarchy of warning
categories understood by the warnings pragma. That
description has now been moved to the warnings <br>
documentation itself, leaving perllexwarn as a stub that
points to it. This change consolidates all documentation for
lexical warnings in a single place.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perllocale</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The
documentation now mentions fc() and &quot;, and includes
many clarifications and corrections in general.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perlop</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The language
design of Perl has always called for monomorphic operators.
This is now mentioned explicitly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perlopentut</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The
&quot;open&quot; tutorial has been completely rewritten by
Tom Christiansen, and now focuses on covering only the
basics, rather than providing a comprehensive reference to
all <br>
things openable. This rewrite came as the result of a
vigorous discussion on perl5-porters kicked off by a set of
improvements written by Alexander Hartmaier to the existing
<br>
perlopentut. A &quot;more than you ever wanted to know about
&quot;open&quot;&quot; document may follow in subsequent
versions of perl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perlre</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The fact that
the regexp engine makes no effort to call (?{}) and (??{})
constructs any specified number of times (although it will
basically DWIM in case of a successful <br>
match) has been documented.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The
&quot;/r&quot; modifier (for non-destructive substitution)
is now documented. [perl #119151]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The
documentation for &quot;/x&quot; and &quot;(?#
comment)&quot; has been expanded and clarified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perlreguts</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The
documentation has been updated in the light of recent
changes to regcomp.c.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perlsub</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The need to
predeclare recursive functions with prototypes in order for
the prototype to be honoured in the recursive call is now
documented. [perl #2726]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A list of
subroutine names used by the perl implementation is now
included. [perl #77680]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perltrap</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; There is now a
JavaScript section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perlunicode</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The
documentation has been updated to reflect
&quot;Bidi_Class&quot; changes in Unicode 6.3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perlvar</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A new section
explaining the performance issues of $&lsquo;, $&amp; and
$&rsquo;, including workarounds and changes in different
versions of Perl, has been added.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Three English
variable names which have long been documented but do not
actually exist have been removed from the documentation.
These were $OLD_PERL_VERSION, $OFMT, and <br>
$ARRAY_BASE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(Actually,
&quot;OLD_PERL_VERSION&quot; does exist, starting with this
revision, but remained undocumented until perl 5.22.0.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perlxs</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Several problems
in the &quot;MY_CXT&quot; example have been fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Diagnostics <br>
The following additions or changes have been made to
diagnostic output, including warnings and fatal error
messages. For the complete list of diagnostic messages, see
perldiag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">New Diagnostics <br>
New Errors</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; delete argument
is index/value array slice, use array slice</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(F) You used index/value array
slice syntax (%array[...]) as the argument to
&quot;delete&quot;. You probably meant @array[...] with an @
symbol instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; delete argument
is key/value hash slice, use hash slice</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(F) You used key/value hash
slice syntax (%hash{...}) as the argument to
&quot;delete&quot;. You probably meant @hash{...} with an @
symbol instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Magical list
constants are not supported</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(F) You assigned a magical array
to a stash element, and then tried to use the subroutine
from the same slot. You are asking Perl to do something it
cannot do, details <br>
subject to change between Perl versions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Added Setting $/
to a %s reference is forbidden</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">New Warnings</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; %s on reference
is experimental:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;auto-deref&quot;
feature is experimental.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Starting in v5.14.0, it was
possible to use push, pop, keys, and other built-in
functions not only on aggregate types, but on references to
them. The feature was not <br>
deployed to its original intended specification, and now may
become redundant to postfix dereferencing. It has always
been categorized as an experimental feature, and in <br>
v5.20.0 is carries a warning as such.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warnings will now be issued at
compile time when these operations are detected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">no if $] &gt;= 5.01908, warnings
=&gt; &quot;experimental::autoderef&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Consider, though, replacing the
use of these features, as they may change behavior again
before becoming stable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A sequence of
multiple spaces in a charnames alias definition is
deprecated</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Trailing white-space in a
charnames alias definition is deprecated</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These two deprecation warnings
involving &quot; were incorrectly implemented. They
did not warn by default (now they do) and could not be made
fatal via &quot;use warnings <br>
FATAL =&gt; &rsquo;deprecated&rsquo;&quot; (now they
can).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Attribute
prototype(%s) discards earlier prototype attribute in same
sub</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(W misc) A sub was declared as
&quot;sub foo : prototype(A) : prototype(B) {}&quot;, for
example. Since each sub can only have one prototype, the
earlier declaration(s) are discarded <br>
while the last one is applied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Invalid
character in %s for %s: %s %s</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(W syscalls) Embedded characters
in pathnames or other system call arguments produce a
warning as of 5.20. The parts after the were formerly
ignored by system calls.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Matched
non-Unicode code point 0x%X against Unicode property; may
not be portable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This replaces the message
&quot;Code point 0x%X is not Unicode, all {} matches fail;
all P{} matches succeed&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Missing
&rsquo;]&rsquo; in prototype for %s : %s</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(W illegalproto) A grouping was
started with &quot;[&quot; but never closed with
&quot;]&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Possible
precedence issue with control flow operator</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(W syntax) There is a possible
problem with the mixing of a control flow operator (e.g.
&quot;return&quot;) and a low-precedence operator like
&quot;or&quot;. Consider:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sub { return $a or $b; }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is parsed as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sub { (return $a) or $b; }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Which is effectively just:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sub { return $a; }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Either use parentheses or the
high-precedence variant of the operator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note this may be also triggered
for constructs like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sub { 1 if die; }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Postfix
dereference is experimental</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(S experimental::postderef) This
warning is emitted if you use the experimental postfix
dereference syntax. Simply suppress the warning if you want
to use the feature, but <br>
know that in doing so you are taking the risk of using an
experimental feature which may change or be removed in a
future Perl version:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">no warnings
&quot;experimental::postderef&quot;; <br>
use feature &quot;postderef&quot;, &quot;postderef_qq&quot;;
<br>
$ref-&gt;$*; <br>
$aref-&gt;@*; <br>
$aref-&gt;@[@indices]; <br>
... etc ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Prototype
&rsquo;%s&rsquo; overridden by attribute
&rsquo;prototype(%s)&rsquo; in %s</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(W prototype) A prototype was
declared in both the parentheses after the sub name and via
the prototype attribute. The prototype in parentheses is
useless, since it will be <br>
replaced by the prototype from the attribute before
it&rsquo;s ever used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Scalar value
@%s[%s] better written as $%s[%s]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(W syntax) In scalar context,
you&rsquo;ve used an array index/value slice (indicated by
%) to select a single element of an array. Generally
it&rsquo;s better to ask for a scalar value <br>
(indicated by $). The difference is that $foo[&amp;bar]
always behaves like a scalar, both in the value it returns
and when evaluating its argument, while %foo[&amp;bar]
provides a <br>
list context to its subscript, which can do weird things if
you&rsquo;re expecting only one subscript. When called in
list context, it also returns the index (what &amp;bar
returns) <br>
in addition to the value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Scalar value
@%s{%s} better written as $%s{%s}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(W syntax) In scalar context,
you&rsquo;ve used a hash key/value slice (indicated by %) to
select a single element of a hash. Generally it&rsquo;s
better to ask for a scalar value <br>
(indicated by $). The difference is that $foo{&amp;bar}
always behaves like a scalar, both in the value it returns
and when evaluating its argument, while @foo{&amp;bar} and
<br>
provides a list context to its subscript, which can do weird
things if you&rsquo;re expecting only one subscript. When
called in list context, it also returns the key in addition
<br>
to the value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Setting $/ to a
reference to %s as a form of slurp is deprecated, treating
as undef</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Unexpected exit
%u</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(S) exit() was called or the
script otherwise finished gracefully when
&quot;PERL_EXIT_WARN&quot; was set in
&quot;PL_exit_flags&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Unexpected exit
failure %d</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(S) An uncaught die() was called
when &quot;PERL_EXIT_WARN&quot; was set in
&quot;PL_exit_flags&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Use of literal
control characters in variable names is deprecated</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(D deprecated) Using literal
control characters in the source to refer to the ^FOO
variables, like $^X and ${^GLOBAL_PHASE} is now deprecated.
This only affects code like <br>
$ <br>
&Acirc;&middot; Useless use of greediness modifier</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This fixes [Perl #42957].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Changes to Existing Diagnostics
<br>
&Acirc;&middot; Warnings and errors from the regexp engine
are now UTF-8 clean.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The
&quot;Unknown switch condition&quot; error message has some
slight changes. This error triggers when there is an unknown
condition in a &quot;(?(foo))&quot; conditional. The error
message <br>
used to read:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unknown switch condition (?(%s
in regex;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">But what %s could be was mostly
up to luck. For &quot;(?(foobar))&quot;, you might have seen
&quot;fo&quot; or &quot;f&quot;. For Unicode characters, you
would generally get a corrupted string. The <br>
message has been changed to read:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unknown switch condition
(?(...)) in regex;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Additionally, the &rsquo;&lt;--
HERE&rsquo; marker in the error will now point to the
correct spot in the regex.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The &quot;%s
&quot;X&quot; does not map to Unicode&quot; warning is now
correctly listed as a severe warning rather than as a fatal
error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Under rare
circumstances, one could get a &quot;Can&rsquo;t coerce
readonly REF to string&quot; instead of the customary
&quot;Modification of a read-only value&quot;. This
alternate error message <br>
has been removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &quot;Ambiguous
use of * resolved as operator *&quot;: This and similar
warnings about &quot;%&quot; and &quot;&amp;&quot; used to
occur in some circumstances where there was no operator of
the type cited, so <br>
the warning was completely wrong. This has been fixed [perl
#117535, #76910].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Warnings about
malformed subroutine prototypes are now more consistent in
how the prototypes are rendered. Some of these warnings
would truncate prototypes containing nulls. <br>
In other cases one warning would suppress another. The
warning about illegal characters in prototypes no longer
says &quot;after &rsquo;_&rsquo;&quot; if the bad character
came before the <br>
underscore.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Perl folding
rules are not up-to-date for 0x%X; please use the perlbug
utility to report; in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in
m/%s/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This message is now only in the
regexp category, and not in the deprecated category. It is
still a default (i.e., severe) warning [perl #89648].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; %%s[%s] in
scalar context better written as $%s[%s]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This warning now occurs for any
%array[$index] or %hash{key} known to be in scalar context
at compile time. Previously it was worded &quot;Scalar value
%%s[%s] better written as <br>
$%s[%s]&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Switch condition
not recognized in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The description for this
diagnostic has been extended to cover all cases where the
warning may occur. Issues with the positioning of the arrow
indicator have also been <br>
resolved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The error
messages for &quot;my($a?$b$c)&quot; and
&quot;my(do{})&quot; now mention &quot;conditional
expression&quot; and &quot;do block&quot;, respectively,
instead of reading &rsquo;Can&rsquo;t declare null operation
in <br>
&quot;my&quot;&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; When &quot;use
re &quot;debug&quot;&quot; executes a regex containing a
backreference, the debugging output now shows what string is
being matched.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The now fatal
error message &quot;Character following &quot; must be a
printable (non-control) ASCII character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Utility Changes <br>
a2p</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A possible crash
from an off-by-one error when trying to access before the
beginning of a buffer has been fixed. [perl #120244]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bisect.pl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The git bisection tool
Porting/bisect.pl has had many enhancements.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is provided as part of the
source distribution but not installed because it is not
self-contained as it relies on being run from within a git
checkout. Note also that it makes <br>
no attempt to fix tests, correct runtime bugs or make
something useful to install - its purpose is to make minimal
changes to get any historical revision of interest to build
and <br>
run as close as possible to &quot;as-was&quot;, and thereby
make &quot;git bisect&quot; easy to use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Can optionally
run the test case with a timeout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Can now run
in-place in a clean git checkout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Can run the test
case under &quot;valgrind&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Can apply user
supplied patches and fixes to the source checkout before
building.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Now has fixups
to enable building several more historical ranges of
bleadperl, which can be useful for pinpointing the origins
of bugs or behaviour changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">find2perl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; find2perl now
handles &quot;?&quot; wildcards correctly. [perl
#113054]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perlbug</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; perlbug now has
a &quot;-p&quot; option for attaching patches with a bug
report.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; perlbug has been
modified to supply the report template with CRLF line
endings on Windows. [perl #121277
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=121277&gt;]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; perlbug now
makes as few assumptions as possible about the encoding of
the report. This will likely change in the future to assume
UTF-8 by default but allow a user <br>
override.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Configuration and Compilation
<br>
&Acirc;&middot; The Makefile.PL for SDBM_File now generates
a better Makefile, which avoids a race condition during
parallel makes, which could cause the build to fail. This is
the last <br>
known parallel make problem (on *nix platforms), and
therefore we believe that a parallel make should now always
be error free.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; installperl and
installman&rsquo;s option handling has been refactored to
use Getopt::Long. Both are used by the Makefile
&quot;install&quot; targets, and are not installed, so these
changes <br>
are only likely to affect custom installation scripts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Single letter
options now also have long names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Invalid options
are now rejected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Command line
arguments that are not options are now rejected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Each now has a
&quot;--help&quot; option to display the usage message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The behaviour for all valid
documented invocations is unchanged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Where possible,
the build now avoids recursive invocations of make when
building pure-Perl extensions, without removing any
parallelism from the build. Currently around 80 <br>
extensions can be processed directly by the make_ext.pl
tool, meaning that 80 invocations of make and 160
invocations of miniperl are no longer made.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The build system
now works correctly when compiling under GCC or Clang with
link-time optimization enabled (the &quot;-flto&quot;
option). [perl #113022]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Distinct library
basenames with &quot;d_libname_unique&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When compiling perl with this
option, the library files for XS modules are named something
&quot;unique&quot; -- for example, Hash/Util/Util.so becomes
Hash/Util/PL_Hash__Util.so. <br>
This behavior is similar to what currently happens on VMS,
and serves as groundwork for the Android port.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;sysroot&quot; option to indicate the logical root
directory under gcc and clang.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When building with this option
set, both Configure and the compilers search for all headers
and libraries under this new sysroot, instead of /.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is a huge time saver if
cross-compiling, but can also help on native builds if your
toolchain&rsquo;s files have non-standard locations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The
cross-compilation model has been renovated. There&rsquo;s
several new options, and some backwards-incompatible
changes:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">We now build binaries for
miniperl and generate_uudmap to be used on the host, rather
than running every miniperl call on the target; this means
that, short of &rsquo;make test&rsquo;, <br>
we no longer need access to the target system once Configure
is done. You can provide already-built binaries through the
&quot;hostperl&quot; and &quot;hostgenerate&quot; options to
Configure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Additionally, if targeting an
EBCDIC platform from an ASCII host, or viceversa,
you&rsquo;ll need to run Configure with
&quot;-Uhostgenerate&quot;, to indicate that generate_uudmap
should be <br>
run on the target.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, there&rsquo;s also a
way of having Configure end early, right after building the
host binaries, by cross-compiling without specifying a
&quot;targethost&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The incompatible changes include
no longer using xconfig.h, xlib, or Cross.pm, so canned
config files and Makefiles will have to be updated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Related to the
above, there is now a way of specifying the location of sh
(or equivalent) on the target system:
&quot;targetsh&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, Android has its sh
in /system/bin/sh, so if cross-compiling from a more normal
Unixy system with sh in /bin/sh, &quot;targetsh&quot; would
end up as /system/bin/sh, and <br>
&quot;sh&quot; as /bin/sh.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; By default, gcc
4.9 does some optimizations that break perl. The -fwrapv
option disables those optimizations (and probably others),
so for gcc 4.3 and later (since the there <br>
might be similar problems lurking on older versions too, but
-fwrapv was broken before 4.3, and the optimizations
probably won&rsquo;t go away), Configure now adds -fwrapv
unless <br>
the user requests -fno-wrapv, which disables -fwrapv, or
-fsanitize=undefined, which turns the overflows -fwrapv
ignores into runtime errors. [perl #121505 <br>

&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=121505&gt;]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Testing <br>
&Acirc;&middot; The &quot;test.valgrind&quot; make target
now allows tests to be run in parallel. This target allows
Perl&rsquo;s test suite to be run under Valgrind, which
detects certain sorts of C <br>
programming errors, though at significant cost in running
time. On suitable hardware, allowing parallel execution
claws back a lot of that additional cost. [perl #121431]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Various tests in
t/porting/ are no longer skipped when the perl .git
directory is outside the perl tree and pointed to by
$GIT_DIR. [perl #120505]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The test suite
no longer fails when the user&rsquo;s interactive shell
maintains a $PWD environment variable, but the /bin/sh used
for running tests doesn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Platform Support <br>
New Platforms <br>
Android <br>
Perl can now be built for Android, either natively or
through cross-compilation, for all three currently available
architectures (ARM, MIPS, and x86), on a wide range of <br>
versions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bitrig <br>
Compile support has been added for Bitrig, a fork of
OpenBSD.</p>

Support has been added for FreeMiNT, a free open-source OS
for the Atari ST system and its successors, based on the
original MiNT that was officially adopted by Atari.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Synology <br>
Synology ships its NAS boxes with a lean Linux distribution
(DSM) on relative cheap CPU&rsquo;s (like the Marvell
Kirkwood mv6282 - ARMv5tel or Freescale QorIQ P1022 ppc -
e500v2) <br>
not meant for workstations or development. These boxes
should build now. The basic problems are the non-standard
location for tools.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Discontinued Platforms <br>
&quot;sfio&quot; <br>
Code related to supporting the &quot;sfio&quot; I/O system
has been removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl 5.004 added support to use
the native API of &quot;sfio&quot;, AT&amp;T&rsquo;s
Safe/Fast I/O library. This code still built with v5.8.0,
albeit with many regression tests failing, but was <br>
inadvertently broken before the v5.8.1 release, meaning that
it has not worked on any version of Perl released since
then. In over a decade we have received no bug reports <br>
about this, hence it is clear that no-one is using this
functionality on any version of Perl that is still supported
to any degree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AT&amp;T 3b1 <br>
Configure support for the 3b1, also known as the AT&amp;T
Unix PC (and the similar AT&amp;T 7300), has been
removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DG/UX <br>
DG/UX was a Unix sold by Data General. The last release was
in April 2001. It only runs on Data General&rsquo;s own
hardware.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EBCDIC <br>
In the absence of a regular source of smoke reports, code
intended to support native EBCDIC platforms will be removed
from perl before 5.22.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Platform-Specific Notes <br>
Cygwin <br>
&Acirc;&middot; recv() on a connected handle would populate
the returned sender address with whatever happened to be in
the working buffer. recv() now uses a workaround similar to
the <br>
Win32 recv() wrapper and returns an empty string when
recvfrom(2) doesn&rsquo;t modify the supplied address
length. [perl #118843]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Fixed a build
error in cygwin.c on Cygwin 1.7.28.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tests now handle the errors that
occur when &quot;cygserver&quot; isn&rsquo;t running.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GNU/Hurd <br>
The BSD compatibility library &quot;libbsd&quot; is no
longer required for builds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Linux <br>
The hints file now looks for &quot;libgdbm_compat&quot; only
if &quot;libgdbm&quot; itself is also wanted. The former is
never useful without the latter, and in some circumstances,
including it <br>
could actually prevent building.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mac OS <br>
The build system now honors an &quot;ld&quot; setting
supplied by the user running Configure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MidnightBSD <br>
&quot;objformat&quot; was removed from version 0.4-RELEASE
of MidnightBSD and had been deprecated on earlier versions.
This caused the build environment to be erroneously
configured <br>
for &quot;a.out&quot; rather than &quot;elf&quot;. This has
been now been corrected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mixed-endian platforms <br>
The code supporting &quot;pack&quot; and &quot;unpack&quot;
operations on mixed endian platforms has been removed. We
believe that Perl has long been unable to build on mixed
endian <br>
architectures (such as PDP-11s), so we don&rsquo;t think
that this change will affect any platforms which were able
to build v5.18.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VMS <br>
&Acirc;&middot; The &quot;PERL_ENV_TABLES&quot; feature to
control the population of %ENV at perl start-up was broken
in Perl 5.16.0 but has now been fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Skip access
checks on remotes in opendir(). [perl #121002]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A check for glob
metacharacters in a path returned by the &quot;glob()&quot;
operator has been replaced with a check for VMS wildcard
characters. This saves a significant number <br>
of unnecessary &quot;lstat()&quot; calls such that some
simple glob operations become 60-80% faster.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Win32 <br>
&Acirc;&middot; &quot;rename&quot; and &quot;link&quot; on
Win32 now set $! to ENOSPC and EDQUOT when appropriate.
[perl #119857]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The BUILD_STATIC
and ALL_STATIC makefile options for linking some or (nearly)
all extensions statically (into perl520.dll, and into a
separate perl-static.exe too) were <br>
broken for MinGW builds. This has now been fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ALL_STATIC option has also
been improved to include the Encode and Win32 extensions
(for both VC++ and MinGW builds).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Support for
building with Visual C++ 2013 has been added. There are
currently two possible test failures (see &quot;Testing Perl
on Windows&quot; in perlwin32) which will <br>
hopefully be resolved soon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Experimental
support for building with Intel C++ Compiler has been added.
The nmake makefile (win32/Makefile) and the dmake makefile
(win32/makefile.mk) can be used. A <br>
&quot;nmake test&quot; will not pass at this time due to
cpan/CGI/t/url.t.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Killing a
process tree with &quot;kill&quot; in perlfunc and a
negative signal, was broken starting in 5.18.0. In this bug,
&quot;kill&quot; always returned 0 for a negative signal
even for <br>
valid PIDs, and no processes were terminated. This has been
fixed [perl #121230].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The time taken
to build perl on Windows has been reduced quite
significantly (time savings in the region of 30-40% are
typically seen) by reducing the number of, usually <br>
failing, I/O calls for each &quot;require()&quot; (for
miniperl.exe only). [perl #121119
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=121119&gt;]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; About 15 minutes
of idle sleeping was removed from running &quot;make
test&quot; due to a bug in which the timeout monitor used
for tests could not be cancelled once the test <br>
completes, and the full timeout period elapsed before
running the next test file. [perl #121395
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=121395&gt;]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; On a perl built
without pseudo-fork (pseudo-fork builds were not affected by
this bug), killing a process tree with &quot;kill()&quot;
and a negative signal resulted in &quot;kill()&quot; <br>
inverting the returned value. For example, if
&quot;kill()&quot; killed 1 process tree PID then it
returned 0 instead of 1, and if &quot;kill()&quot; was
passed 2 invalid PIDs then it <br>
returned 2 instead of 0. This has probably been the case
since the process tree kill feature was implemented on
Win32. It has now been corrected to follow the <br>
documented behaviour. [perl #121230
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=121230&gt;]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; When building a
64-bit perl, an uninitialized memory read in miniperl.exe,
used during the build process, could lead to a 4GB wperl.exe
being created. This has now been <br>
fixed. (Note that perl.exe itself was unaffected, but
obviously wperl.exe would have been completely broken.)
[perl #121471 <br>

&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=121471&gt;]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Perl can now be
built with gcc version 4.8.1 from
&lt;http://www.mingw.org&gt;. This was previously broken due
to an incorrect definition of DllMain() in one of
perl&rsquo;s source <br>
files. Earlier gcc versions were also affected when using
version 4 of the w32api package. Versions of gcc available
from &lt;http://mingw-w64.sourceforge.net/&gt; were not <br>
affected. [perl #121643
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=121643&gt;]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The test harness

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; When cloning the

accessing parameter information for context stack entries
that included no parameters, as <br>
with &quot;&amp;foo;&quot;. [perl #121721

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Introduced by

&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=113536&gt;,
a memory leak on every call to &quot;system&quot; and
backticks (&quot; &lsquo;&lsquo; &quot;), on most Win32
Perls <br>
starting from 5.18.0 has been fixed. The memory leak only
occurred if you enabled psuedo-fork in your build of Win32
Perl, and were running that build on Server 2003 R2 <br>
or newer OS. The leak does not appear on WinXP SP3. [perl

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WinCE <br>
&Acirc;&middot; The building of XS modules has largely been
restored. Several still cannot (yet) be built but it is now
possible to build Perl on WinCE with only a couple of
further <br>
patches (to Socket and ExtUtils::MakeMaker), hopefully to be
incorporated soon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Perl can now be
built in one shot with no user intervention on WinCE by
running &quot;nmake -f Makefile.ce all&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Support for building with EVC
(Embedded Visual C++) 4 has been restored. Perl can also be
built using Smart Devices for Visual C++ 2005 or 2008.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Internal Changes <br>
&Acirc;&middot; The internal representation has changed for
the match variables $1, $2 etc., $&lsquo;, $&amp;, $&rsquo;,
${^PREMATCH}, ${^MATCH} and ${^POSTMATCH}. It uses slightly
less memory, avoids <br>
string comparisons and numeric conversions during lookup,
and uses 23 fewer lines of C. This change should not affect
any external code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Arrays now use
NULL internally to represent unused slots, instead of
&amp;PL_sv_undef. &amp;PL_sv_undef is no longer treated as a
special value, so av_store(av, 0, &amp;PL_sv_undef) <br>
will cause element 0 of that array to hold a read-only
undefined scalar. &quot;$array[0] = anything&quot; will
croak and &quot;rray[0]&quot; will compare equal to
&quot;ndef&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The SV returned
by HeSVKEY_force() now correctly reflects the UTF8ness of
the underlying hash key when that key is not stored as a SV.
[perl #79074]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Certain rarely
used functions and macros available to XS code are now
deprecated. These are: &quot;utf8_to_uvuni_buf&quot; (use
&quot;utf8_to_uvchr_buf&quot; instead),
&quot;valid_utf8_to_uvuni&quot; <br>
(use &quot;utf8_to_uvchr_buf&quot; instead),
&quot;NATIVE_TO_NEED&quot; (this did not work properly
anyway), and &quot;ASCII_TO_NEED&quot; (this did not work
properly anyway).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Starting in this release, almost
never does application code need to distinguish between the
platform&rsquo;s character set and Latin1, on which the
lowest 256 characters of <br>
Unicode are based. New code should not use
&quot;utf8n_to_uvuni&quot; (use
&quot;utf8_to_uvchr_buf&quot; instead), nor
&quot;uvuni_to_utf8&quot; (use &quot;uvchr_to_utf8&quot;
instead),</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The Makefile
shortcut targets for many rarely (or never) used testing and
profiling targets have been removed, or merged into the only
other Makefile target that uses them. <br>
Specifically, these targets are gone, along with
documentation that referenced them or explained how to use
them:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It&rsquo;s still possible to run
the relevant commands by &quot;hand&quot; - no underlying
functionality has been removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; It is now
possible to keep Perl from initializing locale handling. For
the most part, Perl doesn&rsquo;t pay attention to locale.
(See perllocale.) Nonetheless, until now, on <br>
startup, it has always initialized locale handling to the
system default, just in case the program being executed ends
up using locales. (This is one of the first things a <br>
locale-aware program should do, long before Perl knows if it
will actually be needed or not.) This works well except when
Perl is embedded in another application which wants <br>
a locale that isn&rsquo;t the system default. Now, if the
environment variable &quot;PERL_SKIP_LOCALE_INIT&quot; is
set at the time Perl is started, this initialization step is
skipped. <br>
Prior to this, on Windows platforms, the only workaround for
this deficiency was to use a hacked-up copy of internal Perl
code. Applications that need to use older Perls can <br>
discover if the embedded Perl they are using needs the
workaround by testing that the C preprocessor symbol
&quot;HAS_SKIP_LOCALE_INIT&quot; is not defined. [RT
#38193]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;BmRARE&quot; and &quot;BmPREVIOUS&quot; have been
removed. They were not used anywhere and are not part of the
API. For XS modules, they are now #defined as 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;sv_force_normal&quot;, which usually croaks on
read-only values, used to allow read-only values to be
modified at compile time. This has been changed to croak on
read-only <br>
values regardless. This change uncovered several core
bugs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Perl&rsquo;s new
copy-on-write mechanism (which is now enabled by default),
allows any &quot;SvPOK&quot; scalar to be automatically
upgraded to a copy-on-write scalar when copied. A <br>
reference count on the string buffer is stored in the string
buffer itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ perl -MDevel::Peek
-e&rsquo;$a=&quot;abc&quot;; $b = $a; Dump $a; Dump
$b&rsquo; <br>
SV = PV(0x260cd80) at 0x2620ad8 <br>
REFCNT = 1 <br>
FLAGS = (POK,IsCOW,pPOK) <br>
PV = 0x2619bc0 &quot;abc&quot; <br>
CUR = 3 <br>
LEN = 16 <br>
COW_REFCNT = 1 <br>
SV = PV(0x260ce30) at 0x2620b20 <br>
REFCNT = 1 <br>
FLAGS = (POK,IsCOW,pPOK) <br>
PV = 0x2619bc0 &quot;abc&quot; <br>
CUR = 3 <br>
LEN = 16 <br>
COW_REFCNT = 1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that both scalars share the
same PV buffer and have a COW_REFCNT greater than zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This means that XS code which
wishes to modify the &quot;SvPVX()&quot; buffer of an SV
should call &quot;SvPV_force()&quot; or similar first, to
ensure a valid (and unshared) buffer, and to call <br>
&quot;SvSETMAGIC()&quot; afterwards. This in fact has always
been the case (for example hash keys were already
copy-on-write); this change just spreads the COW behaviour
to a wider <br>
variety of SVs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One important difference is that
before 5.18.0, shared hash-key scalars used to have the
&quot;SvREADONLY&quot; flag set; this is no longer the
case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This new behaviour can still be
disabled by running Configure with -Accflags=-DPERL_NO_COW.
This option will probably be removed in Perl 5.22.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;PL_sawampersand&quot; is now a constant. The switch
this variable provided (to enable/disable the pre-match copy
depending on whether $&amp; had been seen) has been removed
and <br>
replaced with copy-on-write, eliminating a few bugs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The previous behaviour can still
be enabled by running Configure with
-Accflags=-DPERL_SAWAMPERSAND.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The functions
&quot;my_swap&quot;, &quot;my_htonl&quot; and
&quot;my_ntohl&quot; have been removed. It is unclear why
these functions were ever marked as A, part of the API. XS
code can&rsquo;t call them <br>
directly, as it can&rsquo;t rely on them being compiled.
Unsurprisingly, no code on CPAN references them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The signature of
the &quot;Perl_re_intuit_start()&quot; regex function has
changed; the function pointer &quot;intuit&quot; in the
regex engine plugin structure has also changed accordingly.
A <br>
new parameter, &quot;strbeg&quot; has been added; this has
the same meaning as the same-named parameter in
&quot;Perl_regexec_flags&quot;. Previously intuit would try
to guess the start of the <br>
string from the passed SV (if any), and would sometimes get
it wrong (e.g. with an overloaded SV).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The signature of
the &quot;Perl_regexec_flags()&quot; regex function has
changed; the function pointer &quot;exec&quot; in the regex
engine plugin structure has also changed to match. The <br>
&quot;minend&quot; parameter now has type
&quot;SSize_t&quot; to better support 64-bit systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; XS code may use
various macros to change the case of a character or code
point (for example &quot;toLOWER_utf8()&quot;). Only a
couple of these were documented until now; and now they <br>
should be used in preference to calling the underlying
functions. See &quot;Character case changing&quot; in
perlapi.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The code dealt
rather inconsistently with uids and gids. Some places
assumed that they could be safely stored in UVs, others in
IVs, others in ints. Four new macros are <br>
introduced: SvUID(), sv_setuid(), SvGID(), and
sv_setgid()</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;sv_pos_b2u_flags&quot; has been added to the API. It
is similar to &quot;sv_pos_b2u&quot;, but supports long
strings on 64-bit platforms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;PL_exit_flags&quot; can now be used by perl embedders
or other XS code to have perl &quot;warn&quot; or
&quot;abort&quot; on an attempted exit. [perl #52000]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Compiling with
&quot;-Accflags=-PERL_BOOL_AS_CHAR&quot; now allows C99 and
C++ compilers to emulate the aliasing of &quot;bool&quot; to
&quot;char&quot; that perl does for C89 compilers. [perl
#120314]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The
&quot;sv&quot; argument in &quot;sv_2pv_flags&quot; in
perlapi, &quot;sv_2iv_flags&quot; in perlapi,
&quot;sv_2uv_flags&quot; in perlapi, and
&quot;sv_2nv_flags&quot; in perlapi and their older wrappers
sv_2pv, sv_2iv, <br>
sv_2uv, sv_2nv, is now non-NULL. Passing NULL now will
crash. When the non-NULL marker was introduced en masse in
5.9.3 the functions were marked non-NULL, but since the <br>
creation of the SV API in 5.0 alpha 2, if NULL was passed,
the functions returned 0 or false-type values. The code that
supports &quot;sv&quot; argument being non-NULL dates to 5.0
<br>
alpha 2 directly, and indirectly to Perl 1.0 (pre 5.0 api).
The lack of documentation that the functions accepted a NULL
&quot;sv&quot; was corrected in 5.11.0 and between 5.11.0
and <br>
5.19.5 the functions were marked NULLOK. As an optimization
the NULLOK code has now been removed, and the functions
became non-NULL marked again, because core getter-type <br>
macros never pass NULL to these functions and would crash
before ever passing NULL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The only way a NULL
&quot;sv&quot; can be passed to sv_2*v* functions is if XS
code directly calls sv_2*v*. This is unlikely as XS code
uses Sv*V* macros to get the underlying value <br>
out of the SV. One possible situation which leads to a NULL
&quot;sv&quot; being passed to sv_2*v* functions, is if XS
code defines its own getter type Sv*V* macros, which check
for <br>
NULL before dereferencing and checking the SV&rsquo;s flags
through public API Sv*OK* macros or directly using private
API &quot;SvFLAGS&quot;, and if &quot;sv&quot; is NULL, then
calling the sv_2*v <br>
functions with a NULL litteral or passing the &quot;sv&quot;
containing a NULL value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; newATTRSUB is
now a macro</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The public API newATTRSUB was
previously a macro to the private function Perl_newATTRSUB.

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Changes in
warnings raised by &quot;utf8n_to_uvchr()&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This bottom level function
decodes the first character of a UTF-8 string into a code
point. It is accessible to &quot;XS&quot; level code, but
it&rsquo;s discouraged from using it directly. <br>
There are higher level functions that call this that should
be used instead, such as &quot;utf8_to_uvchr_buf&quot; in
perlapi. For completeness though, this documents some
changes to <br>
it. Now, tests for malformations are done before any tests
for other potential issues. One of those issues involves
code points so large that they have never appeared in <br>
any official standard (the current standard has scaled back
the highest acceptable code point from earlier versions). It
is possible (though not done in CPAN) to warn and/or <br>
forbid these code points, while accepting smaller code
points that are still above the legal Unicode maximum. The
warning message for this now includes the code point if <br>
representable on the machine. Previously it always displayed
raw bytes, which is what it still does for non-representable
code points.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Regexp engine
changes that affect the pluggable regex engine interface</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Many flags that used to be
exposed via regexp.h and used to populate the extflags
member of struct regexp have been removed. These fields were
technically private to Perl&rsquo;s <br>
own regexp engine and should not have been exposed there in
the first place.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The affected flags are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RXf_NOSCAN <br>

now consistently uses &quot;av_tindex()&quot; (&quot;the top
index of an array&quot;) as a more clearly-named synonym for
&quot;av_len()&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The obscure
interpreter variable &quot;PL_timesbuf&quot; is expected to
be removed early in the 5.21.x development series, so that
Perl 5.22.0 will not provide it to XS authors. While <br>
the variable still exists in 5.20.0, we hope that this
advance warning of the deprecation will help anyone who is
using that variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Selected Bug Fixes <br>
Regular Expressions <br>
&Acirc;&middot; Fixed a small number of regexp constructions
that could either fail to match or crash perl when the
string being matched against was allocated above the 2GB
line on 32-bit <br>
systems. [RT #118175]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Various memory
leaks involving the parsing of the &quot;(?[...])&quot;
regular expression construct have been fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;(?[...])&quot; now allows interpolation of precompiled
patterns consisting of &quot;(?[...])&quot; with bracketed
character classes inside (&quot;$pat = qr/(?[ [a] ])/; /(?[
$pat ])/&quot;). <br>
Formerly, the brackets would confuse the regular expression
parser.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The
&quot;Quantifier unexpected on zero-length expression&quot;
warning message could appear twice starting in Perl v5.10
for a regular expression also containing alternations (e.g.,
<br>
&quot;a|b&quot;) triggering the trie optimisation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Perl v5.18
inadvertently introduced a bug whereby interpolating mixed
up- and down-graded UTF-8 strings in a regex could result in
malformed UTF-8 in the pattern: <br>
specifically if a downgraded character in the range
&quot;0..&quot; followed a UTF-8 string, e.g.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">utf8::upgrade( my $u =
&quot;5}&quot;); <br>
utf8::downgrade(my $d = &quot;5}&quot;); <br>
/$u$d/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[RT #118297]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; In regular
expressions containing multiple code blocks, the values of
$1, $2, etc., set by nested regular expression calls would
leak from one block to the next. Now these <br>
variables always refer to the outer regular expression at
the start of an embedded block [perl #117917].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;/$qr/p&quot; was broken in Perl 5.18.0; the
&quot;/p&quot; flag was ignored. This has been fixed. [perl
#118213]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Starting in Perl
5.18.0, a construct like &quot;/[#](?{})/x&quot; would have
its &quot;#&quot; incorrectly interpreted as a comment. The
code block would be skipped, unparsed. This has been <br>
corrected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Starting in Perl
5.001, a regular expression like &quot;/[#$a]/x&quot; or
&quot;/[#]$a/x&quot; would have its &quot;#&quot;
incorrectly interpreted as a comment, so the variable would
not interpolate. <br>
This has been corrected. [perl #45667]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Perl 5.18.0
inadvertently made dereferenced regular expressions
(&quot;${ qr// }&quot;) false as booleans. This has been
fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The use of
&quot;G&quot; in regular expressions, where it&rsquo;s not
at the start of the pattern, is now slightly less buggy
(although it is still somewhat problematic).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Where a regular
expression included code blocks (&quot;/(?{...})/&quot;),
and where the use of constant overloading triggered a
re-compilation of the code block, the second compilation
<br>
didn&rsquo;t see its outer lexical scope. This was a
regression in Perl 5.18.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The string
position set by &quot;pos&quot; could shift if the string
changed representation internally to or from utf8. This
could happen, e.g., with references to objects with string
<br>
overloading.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Taking
references to the return values of two &quot;pos&quot; calls
with the same argument, and then assigning a reference to
one and &quot;undef&quot; to the other, could result in
assertion <br>
failures or memory leaks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Elements of @-
and @+ now update correctly when they refer to non-existent
captures. Previously, a referenced element (&quot;$ref =
[1]&quot;) could refer to the wrong match after <br>
subsequent matches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The code that
parses regex backrefs (or ambiguous backref/octals) such as
123 did a simple atoi(), which could wrap round to negative
values on long digit strings and cause <br>
segmentation faults. This has now been fixed. [perl
#119505]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Assigning
another typeglob to &quot;*^R&quot; no longer makes the
regular expression engine crash.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The &quot;egular
expression escape, when used without the curly braces (to
mean &quot;[^0&quot;), was ignoring a following
&quot;*&quot; if followed by whitespace under /x. It had
been this <br>
way since &quot;o mean &quot;[^0&quot; was introduced in
5.12.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;s///&quot;, &quot;tr///&quot; and &quot;y///&quot; now
work when a wide character is used as the delimiter. [perl
#120463]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Some cases of
unterminated (?...) sequences in regular expressions (e.g.,
&quot;/(?&lt;/&quot;) have been fixed to produce the proper
error message instead of &quot;panic: memory wrap&quot;.
Other <br>
cases (e.g., &quot;/(?(/&quot;) have yet to be fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; When a reference
to a reference to an overloaded object was returned from a
regular expression &quot;(??{...})&quot; code block, an
incorrect implicit dereference could take place if <br>
the inner reference had been returned by a code block
previously.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A tied variable
returned from &quot;(??{...})&quot; sees the inner values of
match variables (i.e., the $1 etc. from any matches inside
the block) in its FETCH method. This was not <br>
the case if a reference to an overloaded object was the last
thing assigned to the tied variable. Instead, the match
variables referred to the outer pattern during the FETCH
<br>
call.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Fix unexpected
tainting via regexp using locale. Previously, under certain
conditions, the use of character classes could cause
tainting when it shouldn&rsquo;t. Some character <br>
classes are locale-dependent, but before this patch,
sometimes tainting was happening even for character classes
that don&rsquo;t depend on the locale. [perl #120675]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Under certain
conditions, Perl would throw an error if in an lookbehind
assertion in a regexp, the assertion referred to a named
subpattern, complaining the lookbehind was <br>
variable when it wasn&rsquo;t. This has been fixed. [perl
#120600], [perl #120618]. The current fix may be improved on
in the future.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; $^R wasn&rsquo;t
available outside of the regular expression that initialized
it. [perl #121070]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A large set of
fixes and refactoring for re_intuit_start() was merged, the
highlights are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Fixed a panic
when compiling the regular expression
&quot;/[xy]{2}/&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Fixed a
performance regression when performing a global pattern
match against a UTF-8 string. [perl #120692]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Fixed another
performance issue where matching a regular expression like
&quot;/ab.{1,2}x/&quot; against a long UTF-8 string would
unnecessarily calculate byte offsets for a large <br>
portion of the string. [perl #120692]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Fixed an
alignment error when compiling regular expressions when
built with GCC on HP-UX 64-bit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; On 64-bit
platforms &quot;pos&quot; can now be set to a value higher
than 2**31-1. [perl #72766]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl 5 Debugger and -d <br>
&Acirc;&middot; The debugger&rsquo;s &quot;man&quot; command
been fixed. It was broken in the v5.18.0 release. The
&quot;man&quot; command is aliased to the names
&quot;doc&quot; and &quot;perldoc&quot; - all now work
again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; @_ is now
correctly visible in the debugger, fixing a regression
introduced in v5.18.0&rsquo;s debugger. [RT #118169]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Under
copy-on-write builds (the default as of 5.20.0)
&quot;${&rsquo;_&lt;-e&rsquo;}[0]&quot; no longer gets
mangled. This is the first line of input saved for the
debugger&rsquo;s use for one-liners <br>
[perl #118627].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; On non-threaded
builds, setting &quot;${&quot;_&lt;filename&quot;}&quot; to
a reference or typeglob no longer causes
&quot;__FILE__&quot; and some error messages to produce a
corrupt string, and no longer <br>
prevents &quot;#line&quot; directives in string evals from
providing the source lines to the debugger. Threaded builds
were unaffected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Starting with
Perl 5.12, line numbers were off by one if the -d switch was
used on the #! line. Now they are correct.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &quot;*DB::DB =
sub {} if 0&quot; no longer stops Perl&rsquo;s debugging
mode from finding &quot;DB::DB&quot; subs declared
thereafter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;%{&rsquo;_&lt;...&rsquo;}&quot; hashes now set
breakpoints on the corresponding
&quot;@{&rsquo;_&lt;...&rsquo;}&quot; rather than whichever
array @DB::dbline is aliased to. [perl #119799]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Call set-magic
when setting $DB::sub. [perl #121255]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The
debugger&rsquo;s &quot;n&quot; command now respects lvalue
subroutines and steps over them [perl #118839].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Lexical Subroutines <br>
&Acirc;&middot; Lexical constants (&quot;my sub a() { 42

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Parameter
prototypes attached to lexical subroutines are now respected

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Syntax errors in

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The dtrace
sub-entry probe now works with lexical subs, instead of
crashing [perl #118305].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Undefining an
inlinable lexical subroutine (&quot;my sub foo() { 42 }
undef &amp;foo&quot;) would result in a crash if warnings

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; An undefined
lexical sub used as an inherited method no longer
crashes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The presence of
a lexical sub named &quot;CORE&quot; no longer stops the
CORE:: prefix from working.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Everything Else <br>
&Acirc;&middot; The OP allocation code now returns correctly
aligned memory in all cases for &quot;struct pmop&quot;.
Previously it could return memory only aligned to a 4-byte
boundary, which is not <br>
correct for an ithreads build with 64 bit IVs on some 32 bit
platforms. Notably, this caused the build to fail completely
on sparc GNU/Linux. [RT #118055]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Evaluating large
hashes in scalar context is now much faster, as the number
of used chains in the hash is now cached for larger hashes.
Smaller hashes continue not to store <br>
it and calculate it when needed, as this saves one IV. That
would be 1 IV overhead for every object built from a hash.
[RT #114576]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Perl v5.16
inadvertently introduced a bug whereby calls to XSUBs that
were not visible at compile time were treated as lvalues and
could be assigned to, even when the <br>
subroutine was not an lvalue sub. This has been fixed. [RT
#117947]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; In Perl v5.18.0
dualvars that had an empty string for the string part but a
non-zero number for the number part starting being treated
as true. In previous versions they <br>
were treated as false, the string representation taking
precedeence. The old behaviour has been restored. [RT
#118159]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Since Perl
v5.12, inlining of constants that override built-in keywords
of the same name had countermanded &quot;use subs&quot;,
causing subsequent mentions of the constant to use the <br>
built-in keyword instead. This has been fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The warning
produced by &quot;-l $handle&quot; now applies to IO refs
and globs, not just to glob refs. That warning is also now
UTF8-clean. [RT #117595]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &quot;delete
local $ENV{nonexistent_env_var}&quot; no longer leaks
memory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &quot;sort&quot;
and &quot;require&quot; followed by a keyword prefixed with
&quot;CORE::&quot; now treat it as a keyword, and not as a
subroutine or module name. [RT #24482]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Through certain
conundrums, it is possible to cause the current package to
be freed. Certain operators (&quot;bless&quot;,
&quot;reset&quot;, &quot;open&quot;, &quot;eval&quot;) could
not cope and would crash. <br>
They have been made more resilient. [RT #117941]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Aliasing
filehandles through glob-to-glob assignment would not update
internal method caches properly if a package of the same
name as the filehandle existed, resulting in <br>
filehandle method calls going to the package instead. This
has been fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;./Configure -de -Dusevendorprefix&quot; didn&rsquo;t
default. [RT #64126]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The
&quot;Statement unlikely to be reached&quot; warning was
listed in perldiag as an &quot;exec&quot;-category warning,
but was enabled and disabled by the &quot;syntax&quot;
category. On the other <br>
hand, the &quot;exec&quot; category controlled its
fatal-ness. It is now entirely handled by the
&quot;exec&quot; category.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The
&quot;Replacement list is longer that search list&quot;
warning for &quot;tr///&quot; and &quot;y///&quot; no longer
occurs in the presence of the &quot;/c&quot; flag. [RT

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Stringification
of NVs are not cached so that the lexical locale controls
stringification of the decimal point. [perl #108378] [perl
#115800]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; There have been
several fixes related to Perl&rsquo;s handling of locales.
perl #38193 was described above in &quot;Internal
Changes&quot;. Also fixed is #118197, where the radix
(decimal <br>
point) character had to be an ASCII character (which
doesn&rsquo;t work for some non-Western languages); and
#115808, in which &quot;POSIX::setlocale()&quot; on failure
returned an &quot;undef&quot; <br>
which didn&rsquo;t warn about not being defined even if
those warnings were enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Compiling a
&quot;split&quot; operator whose third argument is a named
constant evaluating to 0 no longer causes the
constant&rsquo;s value to change.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A named constant
used as the second argument to &quot;index&quot; no longer
gets coerced to a string if it is a reference, regular
expression, dualvar, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A named constant
evaluating to the undefined value used as the second
argument to &quot;index&quot; no longer produces
&quot;uninitialized&quot; warnings at compile time. It will
still produce <br>
them at run time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; When a scalar
was returned from a subroutine in @INC, the referenced
scalar was magically converted into an IO thingy, possibly
resulting in &quot;Bizarre copy&quot; errors if that <br>
scalar continued to be used elsewhere. Now Perl uses an
internal copy of the scalar instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Certain uses of
the &quot;sort&quot; operator are optimised to modify an
array in place, such as &quot;@a = sort @a&quot;. During the
sorting, the array is made read-only. If a sort block <br>
should happen to die, then the array remained read-only even
outside the &quot;sort&quot;. This has been fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; $a and $b inside
a sort block are aliased to the actual arguments to
&quot;sort&quot;, so they can be modified through those two
variables. This did not always work, e.g., for lvalue <br>
subs and $#ary, and probably many other operators. It works
now.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The arguments to
&quot;sort&quot; are now all in list context. If the
&quot;sort&quot; itself were called in void or scalar
context, then some, but not all, of the arguments used to be
in void <br>
or scalar context.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Subroutine
prototypes with Unicode characters above U+00FF were getting
mangled during closure cloning. This would happen with
subroutines closing over lexical variables <br>
declared outside, and with lexical subs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;UNIVERSAL::can&quot; now treats its first argument the
same way that method calls do: Typeglobs and glob references
with non-empty IO slots are treated as handles, and strings
<br>
are treated as filehandles, rather than packages, if a
handle with that name exists [perl #113932].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Method calls on
typeglobs (e.g., &quot;*ARGV-&gt;getline&quot;) used to
stringify the typeglob and then look it up again. Combined
with changes in Perl 5.18.0, this allowed
&quot;*foo-&gt;bar&quot; <br>
to call methods on the &quot;foo&quot; package (like
&quot;foo-&gt;bar&quot;). In some cases it could cause the
method to be called on the wrong handle. Now a typeglob
argument is treated as a <br>
handle (just like &quot;(oo)-&gt;bar&quot;), or, if its IO
slot is empty, an error is raised.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Assigning a
vstring to a tied variable or to a subroutine argument
aliased to a nonexistent hash or array element now works,
without flattening the vstring into a regular <br>
string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &quot;pos&quot;,
&quot;tie&quot;, &quot;tied&quot; and &quot;untie&quot; did
not work properly on subroutine arguments aliased to
nonexistent hash and array elements [perl #77814,
#27010].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The
&quot;=&gt;&quot; fat arrow operator can now quote built-in
keywords even if it occurs on the next line, making it
consistent with how it treats other barewords.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Autovivifying a
subroutine stub via &quot;$glob&quot; started causing
crashes in Perl 5.18.0 if the $glob was merely a copy of a
real glob, i.e., a scalar that had had a glob <br>
assigned to it. This has been fixed. [perl #119051]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Perl used to
leak an implementation detail when it came to referencing
the return values of certain operators. &quot;for ($a+$b) {
warn ; warn }&quot; used to display two <br>
different memory addresses, because the &quot; <br>
fixed. [perl #21979, #78194, #89188, #109746, #114838,
#115388]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The range
operator &quot;..&quot; was returning the same modifiable
scalars with each call, unless it was the only thing in a
&quot;foreach&quot; loop header. This meant that changes to
values <br>
within the list returned would be visible the next time the
operator was executed. [perl #3105]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Constant folding
and subroutine inlining no longer cause operations that
would normally return new modifiable scalars to return
read-only values instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Closures of the
form &quot;sub () { $some_variable }&quot; are no longer
inlined, causing changes to the variable to be ignored by
callers of the subroutine. [perl #79908]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Return values of
certain operators such as &quot;ref&quot; would sometimes be
shared between recursive calls to the same subroutine,
causing the inner call to modify the value returned <br>
by &quot;ref&quot; in the outer call. This has been
fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;__PACKAGE__&quot; and constants returning a package
name or hash key are now consistently read-only. In various
previous Perl releases, they have become mutable under
certain <br>
circumstances.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Enabling
&quot;used once&quot; warnings no longer causes crashes on
stash circularities created at compile time
(&quot;*Foo::Bar::Foo:: = *Foo::&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Undef constants
used in hash keys (&quot;use constant u =&gt; undef;
$h{+u}&quot;) no longer produce &quot;uninitialized&quot;
warnings at compile time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Modifying a
substitution target inside the substitution replacement no
longer causes crashes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The first
statement inside a string eval used to use the wrong pragma
setting sometimes during constant folding. &quot;eval
&rsquo;uc chr 0xe0&rsquo;&quot; would randomly choose
between Unicode, <br>
byte, and locale semantics. This has been fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The handling of
return values of @INC filters (subroutines returned by
subroutines in @INC) has been fixed in various ways.
Previously tied variables were mishandled, and <br>
setting $_ to a reference or typeglob could result in
crashes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The
&quot;SvPVbyte&quot; XS function has been fixed to work with
tied scalars returning something other than a string. It
used to return utf8 in those cases where &quot;SvPV&quot;
would.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Perl 5.18.0
inadvertently made &quot;--&quot; and &quot;++&quot; crash
on dereferenced regular expressions, and stopped
&quot;++&quot; from flattening vstrings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;bless&quot; no longer dies with &quot;Can&rsquo;t
bless non-reference value&quot; if its first argument is a
tied reference.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;reset&quot; with an argument no longer skips
copy-on-write scalars, regular expressions, typeglob copies,
and vstrings. Also, when encountering those or read-only
values, it no <br>
longer skips any array or hash with the same name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;reset&quot; with an argument now skips scalars aliased
to typeglobs (&quot;for $z (*foo) { reset &quot;z&quot;
}&quot;). Previously it would corrupt memory or crash.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;ucfirst&quot; and &quot;lcfirst&quot; were not
respecting the bytes pragma. This was a regression from Perl
5.12. [perl #117355]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Changes to
&quot;UNIVERSAL::DESTROY&quot; now update DESTROY caches in
all classes, instead of causing classes that have already
had objects destroyed to continue using the old sub. <br>
This was a regression in Perl 5.18. [perl #114864]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; All known
false-positive occurrences of the deprecation warning
&quot;Useless use of &rsquo;&acute;; doesn&rsquo;t escape
metacharacter &rsquo;%c&rsquo;&quot;, added in Perl 5.18.0,
have been removed. [perl <br>
#119101]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The value of $^E
is now saved across signal handlers on Windows. [perl
#85104]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A lexical
filehandle (as in &quot;open my $fh...&quot;) is usually
given a name based on the current package and the name of
the variable, e.g. &quot;main::$fh&quot;. Under recursion,
the <br>
filehandle was losing the &quot;$fh&quot; part of the name.
This has been fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Uninitialized
values returned by XSUBs are no longer exempt from
uninitialized warnings. [perl #118693]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &quot;elsif
(&quot;&quot;)&quot; no longer erroneously produces a
warning about void context. [perl #118753]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Passing
&quot;undef&quot; to a subroutine now causes @_ to contain
the same read-only undefined scalar that &quot;undef&quot;
returns. Furthermore, &quot;exists $_[0]&quot; will now
return true if <br>
&quot;undef&quot; was the first argument. [perl #7508,
#109726]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Passing a
non-existent array element to a subroutine does not usually
autovivify it unless the subroutine modifies its argument.
This did not work correctly with negative <br>
indices and with non-existent elements within the array. The
element would be vivified immediately. The delayed
vivification has been extended to work with those. [perl
<br>
#118691]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Assigning
references or globs to the scalar returned by $#foo after
the @foo array has been freed no longer causes assertion
failures on debugging builds and memory leaks on <br>
regular builds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; On 64-bit
platforms, large ranges like 1..1000000000000 no longer
crash, but eat up all your memory instead. [perl
#119161]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;__DATA__&quot; now puts the &quot;DATA&quot; handle in
the right package, even if the current package has been
renamed through glob assignment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; When
&quot;die&quot;, &quot;last&quot;, &quot;next&quot;,
&quot;redo&quot;, &quot;goto&quot; and &quot;exit&quot;
unwind the scope, it is possible for &quot;DESTROY&quot;
recursively to call a subroutine or format that is currently
being <br>
exited. It that case, sometimes the lexical variables inside
the sub would start out having values from the outer call,
instead of being undefined as they should. This has <br>
been fixed. [perl #119311]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; ${^MPEN} is no
longer treated as a synonym for ${^MATCH}.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Perl now tries a
little harder to return the correct line number in
&quot;(caller)[2]&quot;. [perl #115768]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Line numbers
inside multiline quote-like operators are now reported
correctly. [perl #3643]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;#line&quot; directives inside code embedded in
quote-like operators are now respected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Line numbers are
now correct inside the second here-doc when two here-doc
markers occur on the same line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; An optimization
in Perl 5.18 made incorrect assumptions causing a bad
interaction with the Devel::CallParser CPAN module. If the
module was loaded then lexical variables <br>
declared in separate statements following a
&quot;my(...)&quot; list might fail to be cleared on scope
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &amp;xsub and
&quot;goto &amp;xsub&quot; calls now allow the called
subroutine to autovivify elements of @_.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &amp;xsub and
&quot;goto &amp;xsub&quot; no longer crash if *_ has been
undefined and has no ARRAY entry (i.e. @_ does not
exist).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &amp;xsub and
&quot;goto &amp;xsub&quot; now work with tied @_.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Overlong
identifiers no longer cause a buffer overflow (and a crash).
They started doing so in Perl 5.18.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The warning
&quot;Scalar value @hash{foo} better written as
$hash{foo}&quot; now produces far fewer false positives. In
particular, @hash{+function_returning_a_list} and @hash{ qw
<br>
&quot;foo bar baz&quot; } no longer warn. The same applies
to array slices. [perl #28380, #114024]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &quot;$! =
EINVAL; waitpid(0, WNOHANG);&quot; no longer goes into an
internal infinite loop. [perl #85228]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A possible
segmentation fault in filehandle duplication has been
fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A subroutine in
@INC can return a reference to a scalar containing the
initial contents of the file. However, that scalar was freed
prematurely if not referenced elsewhere, <br>
giving random results.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &quot;last&quot;
no longer returns values that the same statement has
accumulated so far, fixing amongst other things the
long-standing bug that &quot;push @a, last&quot; would try
to return the <br>
@a, copying it like a scalar in the process and resulting in
the error, &quot;Bizarre copy of ARRAY in last.&quot; [perl
#3112]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; In some cases,
closing file handles opened to pipe to or from a process,
which had been duplicated into a standard handle, would call
perl&rsquo;s internal waitpid wrapper with a <br>
pid of zero. With the fix for [perl #85228] this zero pid
was passed to &quot;waitpid&quot;, possibly blocking the
process. This wait for process zero no longer occurs. [perl
<br>
#119893]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;select&quot; used to ignore magic on the fourth
(timeout) argument, leading to effects such as
&quot;select&quot; blocking indefinitely rather than the
expected sleep time. This has now <br>
been fixed. [perl #120102]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The class name
in &quot;for my class $foo&quot; is now parsed correctly. In
the case of the second character of the class name being
followed by a digit (e.g. &rsquo;a1b&rsquo;) this used to
give <br>
the error &quot;Missing $ on loop variable&quot;. [perl
#120112]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Perl 5.18.0
accidentally disallowed &quot;-bareword&quot; under
&quot;use strict&quot; and &quot;use integer&quot;. This has
been fixed. [perl #120288]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &quot;-a&quot;
at the start of a line (or a hyphen with any single letter
that is not a filetest operator) no longer produces an
erroneous &rsquo;Use of &quot;-a&quot; without parentheses
is <br>
ambiguous&rsquo; warning. [perl #120288]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Lvalue context
is now properly propagated into bare blocks and
&quot;if&quot; and &quot;else&quot; blocks in lvalue
subroutines. Previously, arrays and hashes would sometimes
incorrectly be <br>
flattened when returned in lvalue list context, or
&quot;Bizarre copy&quot; errors could occur. [perl
#119797]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Lvalue context
is now propagated to the branches of &quot;||&quot; and
&quot;&amp;&amp;&quot; (and their alphabetic equivalents,
&quot;or&quot; and &quot;and&quot;). This means
&quot;foreach (pos $x || pos $y) {...}&quot; now <br>
allows &quot;pos&quot; to be modified through $_.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &quot;stat&quot;
and &quot;readline&quot; remember the last handle used; the
former for the special &quot;_&quot; filehandle, the latter
for &quot;${^LAST_FH}&quot;. &quot;eval &quot;*foo if
0&quot;&quot; where *foo was the last <br>
handle passed to &quot;stat&quot; or &quot;readline&quot;
could cause that handle to be forgotten if the handle were
not opened yet. This has been fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Various cases of
&quot;delete $::{a}&quot;, &quot;delete $::{ENV}&quot; etc.
causing a crash have been fixed. [perl #54044]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Setting $! to
EACCESS before calling &quot;require&quot; could affect
&quot;require&quot;&rsquo;s behaviour. This has been
fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The
&quot;Can&rsquo;t use 1 to mean $1 in expression&quot;
warning message now only occurs on the right-hand
(replacement) part of a substitution. Formerly it could
happen in code embedded <br>
in the left-hand side, or in any other quote-like
operator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Blessing into a
reference (&quot;bless $thisref, $thatref&quot;) has long
been disallowed, but magical scalars for the second like $/
and those tied were exempt. They no longer are. <br>
[perl #119809]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Blessing into a
reference was accidentally allowed in 5.18 if the class
argument were a blessed reference with stale method caches
(i.e., whose class had had subs defined <br>
since the last method call). They are disallowed once more,
as in 5.16.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;$x-&gt;{key}&quot; where $x was declared as &quot;my
Class $x&quot; no longer crashes if a Class::FIELDS
subroutine stub has been declared.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
@$obj{&rsquo;key&rsquo;} and &quot;${$obj}{key}&quot; used
to be exempt from compile-time field checking (&quot;No such
class field&quot;; see fields) but no longer are.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A nonexistent
array element with a large index passed to a subroutine that
ties the array and then tries to access the element no
longer results in a crash.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Declaring a
subroutine stub named NEGATIVE_INDICES no longer makes
negative array indices crash when the current package is a
tied array class.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Declaring a
&quot;require&quot;, &quot;glob&quot;, or &quot;do&quot;
subroutine stub in the CORE::GLOBAL:: package no longer
makes compilation of calls to the corresponding functions
crash.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Aliasing
CORE::GLOBAL:: functions to constants stopped working in
Perl 5.10 but has now been fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; When
&quot;&lsquo;...&lsquo;&quot; or &quot;qx/.../&quot; calls a
&quot;readpipe&quot; override, double-quotish interpolation
now happens, as is the case when there is no override.
Previously, the presence of an <br>
override would make these quote-like operators act like
&quot;q{}&quot;, suppressing interpolation. [perl
#115330]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lsquo;...&lsquo;&quot; here-docs (with
backticks as the delimiters) now call &quot;readpipe&quot;
overrides. [perl #119827]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;&amp;CORE::exit()&quot; and
&quot;&amp;CORE::die()&quot; now respect vmsish hints.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Undefining a
glob that triggers a DESTROY method that undefines the same
glob is now safe. It used to produce &quot;Attempt to free
unreferenced glob pointer&quot; warnings and leak <br>
memory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If subroutine
redefinition (&quot;eval &rsquo;sub foo{}&rsquo;&quot; or
&quot;newXS&quot; for XS code) triggers a DESTROY method on
the sub that is being redefined, and that method assigns a
subroutine to <br>
the same slot (&quot;*foo = sub {}&quot;), $_[0] is no
longer left pointing to a freed scalar. Now DESTROY is
delayed until the new subroutine has been installed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; On Windows, perl
no longer calls CloseHandle() on a socket handle. This makes
debugging easier on Windows by removing certain irrelevant
bad handle exceptions. It also <br>
fixes a race condition that made socket functions randomly
fail in a Perl process with multiple OS threads, and
possible test failures in dist/IO/t/cachepropagate-tcp.t.
<br>
[perl #120091/118059]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Formats
involving UTF-8 encoded strings, or strange vars like ties,
overloads, or stringified refs (and in recent perls, pure
NOK vars) would generally do the wrong thing in <br>
formats when the var is treated as a string and repeatedly
chopped, as in &quot;^&lt;&lt;&lt;~~&quot; and similar. This
has now been resolved. [perl
#33832/45325/113868/119847/119849/119851]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;semctl(..., SETVAL, ...)&quot; would set the semaphore
to the top 32-bits of the supplied integer instead of the
bottom 32-bits on 64-bit big-endian systems. [perl
#120635]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;readdir()&quot; now only sets $! on error. $! is no
longer set to &quot;EBADF&quot; when then terminating
&quot;undef&quot; is read from the directory unless the
system call sets $!. [perl #118651]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &amp;CORE::glob
no longer causes an intermittent crash due to perl&rsquo;s
stack getting corrupted. [perl #119993]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &quot;open&quot;
with layers that load modules (e.g.,
&quot;&lt;:encoding(utf8)&quot;) no longer runs the risk of
crashing due to stack corruption.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Perl 5.18 broke
autoloading via &quot;-&gt;SUPER::foo&quot; method calls by
looking up AUTOLOAD from the current package rather than the
current package&rsquo;s superclass. This has been <br>
fixed. [perl #120694]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A longstanding
bug causing &quot;do {} until CONSTANT&quot;, where the
constant holds a true value, to read unallocated memory has
been resolved. This would usually happen after a <br>
syntax error. In past versions of Perl it has crashed
intermittently. [perl #72406]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Fix HP-UX $!
failure. HP-UX strerror() returns an empty string for an
unknown error code. This caused an assertion to fail under
DEBUGGING builds. Now instead, the returned <br>
string for &quot;$!&quot; contains text indicating the code
is for an unknown error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
Individually-tied elements of @INC (as in &quot;tie
$INC[0]...&quot;) are now handled correctly. Formerly,
whether a sub returned by such a tied element would be
treated as a sub <br>
depended on whether a FETCH had occurred previously.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &quot;getc&quot;
on a byte-sized handle after the same &quot;getc&quot;
operator had been used on a utf8 handle used to treat the
bytes as utf8, resulting in erratic behavior (e.g.,
malformed <br>
UTF-8 warnings).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; An initial
&quot;{&quot; at the beginning of a format argument line was
always interpreted as the beginning of a block prior to
v5.18. In Perl v5.18, it started being treated as an <br>
ambiguous token. The parser would guess whether it was
supposed to be an anonymous hash constructor or a block
based on the contents. Now the previous behavious has been
<br>
restored. [perl #119973]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; In Perl v5.18
&quot;undef *_; goto &amp;sub&quot; and &quot;local *_; goto
&amp;sub&quot; started crashing. This has been fixed. [perl
#119949]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Backticks
(&quot; &lsquo;&lsquo; &quot; or &quot; qx// &quot;)
combined with multiple threads on Win32 could result in
output sent to stdout on one thread being captured by
backticks of an external command <br>
in another thread.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This could occur for
pseudo-forked processes too, as Win32&rsquo;s pseudo-fork is
implemented in terms of threads. [perl #77672]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &quot;open $fh,
&quot;&gt;+&quot;, undef&quot; no longer leaks memory when
TMPDIR is set but points to a directory a temporary file
cannot be created in. [perl #120951]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &quot; for (
$h{k} || &rsquo;&rsquo; ) &quot; no longer auto-vivifies
$h{k}. [perl #120374]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; On Windows
machines, Perl now emulates the POSIX use of the environment
for locale initialization. Previously, the environment was
ignored. See &quot;ENVIRONMENT&quot; in perllocale.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Fixed a crash
when destroying a self-referencing GLOB. [perl #121242]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Known Problems <br>
&Acirc;&middot; IO::Socket is known to fail tests on AIX
5.3. There is a patch
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=120835&gt; in
the request tracker, #120835, which may be applied to <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Obituary <br>
Diana Rosa, 27, of Rio de Janeiro, went to her long rest on
May 10, 2014, along with the plush camel she kept hanging on
her computer screen all the time. She was a passionate <br>
Perl hacker who loved the language and its community, and
who never missed a Rio.pm event. She was a true artist, an
enthusiast about writing code, singing arias and graffiting
<br>
walls. We&rsquo;ll never forget you.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Greg McCarroll died on August
28, 2013.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Greg was well known for many
good reasons. He was one of the organisers of the first
YAPC::Europe, which concluded with an unscheduled auction
where he frantically tried to raise <br>
extra money to avoid the conference making a loss. It was
Greg who mistakenly arrived for a london.pm meeting a week
late; some years later he was the one who sold the choice of
<br>
official meeting date at a YAPC::Europe auction, and
eventually as glorious leader of london.pm he got to inherit
the irreverent confusion that he had created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Always helpful, friendly and
cheerfully optimistic, you will be missed, but never
forgotten.</p>
