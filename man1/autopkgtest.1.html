<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
autopkgtest - test an installed binary package using the
source package&rsquo;s tests</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
autopkgtest [options...] testsrc [testbinary...] --
virt-server [virt-server-arg...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
autopkgtest runs tests on binary Debian or Click packages,
as installed on a system (called &quot;testbed&quot;). The
tests are supplied in the source package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">autopkgtest runs each test
supplied by a particular package and reports the results. It
drives the specified virtualisation regime as appropriate,
parses the test description <br>
metadata, and arranges for data to be copied to and from the
testbed as required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See
/usr/share/doc/autopkgtest/README.running-tests.rst.gz for
an introduction about how to use autopkgtest.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TESTING A DEBIAN PACKAGE <br>
Positional (non-option) arguments specify exactly one source
package (containing the test code) and optionally some
binary packages to test.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">testsrc can be one of:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">.dsc file <br>
Run tests from Debian .dsc source package. By default the
package will also be built and the resulting binaries will
be used to satisfy test dependencies; to disable that, <br>
specify the -B/--no-built-binaries option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">source package directory <br>
Run tests from a Debian source tree directory. If that is an
unbuilt tree, this is very similar to specifying a .dsc. If
that is a built tree, all test dependencies get <br>
satisfied by archive packages, unless you explicitly specify
locally built .debs as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Attention: If you just specify a
bare directory name which is a legal Debian source package
name, it will be interpreted as the latter (see below). In
this case, prefix <br>
the directory name with ./.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">current directory <br>
If no source package is specified on the command line and
the current directory is a Debian source package, this will
be tested.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">source package name <br>
Downloads the given source package name with apt-get source
in the testbed and run its tests. This is similar to
specifying a .dsc but avoids copying the source from the
<br>
host to the testbed. Possibly built binaries (if the test
specifies needs-build) will not be used to satisfy
dependencies, as usually in this mode you want to test
bina&acirc; <br>
ries from a real archive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">git URL or URL#branch <br>
Git-clones the given URL (which must contain an unbuilt
Debian source tree) and runs the tests from that. If branch
is given, this branch will be checked out instead of <br>
the default (usually &quot;master&quot;). This can also be a
more general refspec such as #refs/pull/123/head&quot; for a
GitHub pull request.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is very similar to cloning
manually and specifying the checkout directory as test; i.
e. this is commonly used with --no-built-binaries. The git
package will be <br>
installed if necessary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">.changes file <br>
Run tests from the .dsc source package in the given .changes
file. If the .changes contains .deb packages, they will be
used for the test. Acts as if you had specified <br>
the .debs and .dsc from the .changes file as explicit
arguments. Note that if the .changes contains only debs, the
corresponding .dsc still needs to be specified along&acirc;
<br>
side, or the current directory must be the source
package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All other positional arguments
must be .deb binary packages. They will be used for both
build and test dependencies of the source package. If any
binary package is given, then <br>
--no-built-binaries is implied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TESTING A CLICK PACKAGE <br>
This needs exactly one .click package. If its manifest
specifies an x-source URL, the corresponding source package
will be downloaded and tests run from there; then a source
<br>
directory does not need to be given. Otherwise specifying a
source directory as positional argument is mandatory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For testing a local .click
package, give its path to autopkgtest. For testing a
preinstalled click, use --installed-click
com.example.myclick (this cannot be given as positional <br>
argument as this cannot be disambiguated from Debian source
package names).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples with explicit click
source directory:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">autopkgtest
src/myclick_0.1_all.click com.example.myclick src/myclick/
-- [...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">autopkgtest --installed-click
com.example.myclick src/myclick/ -- [...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples without click source
directory; click package needs to have x-source manifest
entry:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">autopkgtest
src/myclick_0.1_all.click -- [...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">autopkgtest --installed-click
com.example.myclick -- [...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TEST OPTIONS <br>
-B | --no-built-binaries <br>
Binaries from unbuilt source packages (see above) will not
be built or ignored, and dependencies are satisfied with
packages from the archive. Note that the source package <br>
still gets built if a test requires build-needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--override-control=PATH <br>
Read the test metadata from PATH instead of
debian/tests/control (for Debian sources) or the Click
manifest.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--test-name=TEST <br>
Run only the given test name (from test control file). This
replaces --testname which is deprecated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LOGGING OPTIONS <br>
If you don&rsquo;t specify any option, autopkgtest only
writes its output/results to stderr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o dir | --output-dir=dir <br>
Specifies that test artifacts (stderr and stdout from the
tests, the log file, built binary packages etc.) should be
placed in the given directory. dir must not exist yet <br>
or be empty, otherwise autopkgtest will refuse to use
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l logfile | --log-file=logfile
<br>
Specifies that the trace log should be written to logfile
instead of to output-dir.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--summary=summary <br>
Specifies that a summary of the outcome should be written to
summary. The events in the summary are written to the log in
any case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q | --quiet <br>
Do not send a copy of autopkgtest&rsquo;s trace logstream to
stderr. This option does not affect the copy sent to logfile
or output-dir. Note that without the trace logstream <br>
it can be very hard to diagnose problems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TEST BED SETUP OPTIONS <br>
--setup-commands=commands <br>
Run commands after opening the testbed. This can be used e.
g. to enable additional apt sources, run apt-get update or
similar. If commands is an existing file name, the <br>
commands are read from that; otherwise it is a string with
the actual commands that gets run as-is. File names without
directory will be searched in both the current <br>
directory and in /usr/share/autopkgtest/setup-commands/ so
you do not need to give the full path for setup scripts
shipped with autopkgtest.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normally, if the setup commands
fail, autopkgtest will consider this a transient testbed
error (exit code 16). However, if the setup commands exit
with code 100, autop&acirc; <br>
kgtest will consider this an &quot;erroneous package&quot;
(exit code 12) instead, so this can be used to e. g. detect
upgrade errors to a new version. Note that apt exits with
exit <br>
code 100 in these cases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option can be specified
multiple times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If --user is given or the test
bed provides a suggested-normal-user capability, the
$AUTOPKGTEST_NORMAL_USER environment variable will be set to
that user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the setup commands affect
anything in boot directories (like /boot or
/lib/systemd/system) and the testbed supports rebooting, the
testbed will be rebooted after the <br>
setup commands. This can be suppressed by creating a file
/run/autopkgtest_no_reboot.stamp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--setup-commands-boot=commands
<br>
Run commands after the --setup-commands, and after every
reboot. For example, these commands could be used to add
files in a tmpfs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These commands never cause the
testbed to be rebooted (because that could lead to an
infinite loop). Otherwise, they are just like the
--setup-commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option can be specified
multiple times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--apt-upgrade | -U <br>
Run apt-get update and apt-get dist-upgrade -y in the
testbed before running the tests.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--apt-pocket=pocket[=pkgname,src:srcname,...]
<br>
Add apt sources for release-pocket. This finds the first deb
line in /etc/apt/sources.list which does not already specify
a pocket and adds a deb and deb-src line with <br>
that pocket to /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pocket.list. This
also calls apt-get update for the new pocket (but not for
anything else).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a package list is given after
=, set up apt pinning to use only those packages from
pocket. An entry &quot;src:srcname&quot; expands to all
binary packages built by that source. <br>
This can be used for minimizing dependencies taken from
pocket so that package updates in that pocket can be tested
independently from each other for better isolation. <br>
Attention: This does not currently resolve some situations
where dependencies of the given packages can only be
resolved in the given pocket. In that case the apt pinning
<br>
will be removed and package installation will be retried
with the entirety of pocket.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--copy=HOSTPATH:TESTBEDPATH <br>
Copy file or directory from host into testbed after opening.
This happens before --setup-commands thus you can use these
files in the setup commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--env=VAR=value <br>
Set arbitrary environment variable in the build and test.
Can be specified multiple times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USER/PRIVILEGE HANDLING OPTIONS
<br>
-u user | --user=user <br>
Run builds and tests as user on the testbed. This needs root
on the testbed; if root on the testbed is not available then
builds and tests run as whatever user is pro&acirc; <br>
vided.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--gain-root=gain-root <br>
Prefixes debian/rules binary with gain-root. The default is
not to use anything, except that if --user is supplied or
root on the testbed is not available the default is <br>
fakeroot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEBUGGING OPTIONS <br>
--debug|-d <br>
Include additional debugging information in the trace log.
Each additional -d increases the debugging level; the
current maximum is -ddd. If you like to see what&rsquo;s
going <br>
on, -d or -dd is recommended.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--shell-fail|-s <br>
Run an interactive shell in the testbed after a failed
build, test, or dependency installation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--shell <br>
Run an interactive shell in the testbed after every
test.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TIMEOUT OPTIONS <br>
--timeout-which=seconds <br>
Use a different timeout for operations on or with the
testbed. There are five timeouts affected by five values of
which: short: supposedly short operations like setting <br>
up the testbed&rsquo;s apt and checking the state (default:
100s); install: installation of packages including
dependencies (default: 3,000s); test: test runs (default:
<br>
10,000s); copy: copy files/directories between host and
testbed (default: 300s); and build: builds (default:
100,000s). The value must be specified as an integer number
<br>
of seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--timeout-factor=double <br>
Multiply all of the default timeouts by the specified factor
(see --timeout-which above). Only the defaults are affected;
explicit timeout settings are used exactly as <br>
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LOCALE OPTIONS <br>
--set-lang=langval <br>
When running commands on the testbed, sets the LANG
environment variable to langval. The default in autopkgtest
is to set it to C.UTF-8.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OTHER OPTIONS <br>
--no-auto-control <br>
Disable automatic test generation with autodep8, even if it
is installed. In that case, packages without tests will exit
with code 8 (&quot;No tests in this package&quot;) just like
<br>
without autodep8.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--build-parallel=N <br>
Set parallel=N DEB_BUILD_OPTION for building packages. By
default this is the number of available processors. This is
mostly useful in containers where you can restrict <br>
the available RAM, but not restrict the number of CPUs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h|--help <br>
Show command line help and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VIRTUALIZATION SERVER <br>
-- virt-server virt-server-arg... <br>
Specifies the virtualisation regime server, as a command and
arguments to invoke. virt-server must be an existing
autopkgtest virtualization server such as schroot or <br>
qemu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All the remaining arguments and
options after -- are passed to the virtualisation server
program. See the manpages of the individual servers for how
to use them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT FORMAT <br>
During a normal test run, one line is printed for each test.
This consists of a short string identifying the test, some
horizontal whitespace, and either PASS or FAIL reason or
<br>
SKIP reason where the pass/fail indication is separated by
any reason by some horizontal whitespace.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The string to identify the test
consists of a short alphanumeric string invented by
autopkgtest to distinguish different command-line arguments,
the argid, followed by a hyphen <br>
and the test name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sometimes a SKIP will be
reported when the name of the test is not known or not
applicable: for example, when there are no tests in the
package, or a there is a test stanza which <br>
contains features not understood by this version of
autopkgtest. In this case * will appear where the name of
the test should be.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If autopkgtest detects that
erroneous package(s) are involved, it will print the two
lines blame: blamed-thing... and badpkg: message. Here each
whitespace-separated blamed- <br>
thing is one of arg:argument (representing a pathname found
in a command line argument), dsc:package (a source package
name), deb:package (a binary package name) or possibly <br>
other strings to be determined. This indicates which
arguments and/or packages might have contributed to the
problem; the ones which were processed most recently and
which are <br>
therefore most likely to be the cause of a problem are
listed last.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION FILES <br>
If you use lots of options or nontrivial virt server
arguments, you can put any part of the command line into a
text file, with one line per option. E. g. you can create a
file <br>
sid.cfg with contents like</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s <br>
--output-dir=/tmp/testout <br>
--apt-upgrade <br>
-- <br>
schroot <br>
sid</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and then run</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">autopkgtest foo_1_amd64.changes
@sid.cfg</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The contents of the
configuration file will be expanded in-place as if you would
have given its contents on the command line. Please ensure
that you don&rsquo;t place spaces between <br>
short options and their values, they would become a part of
the argument value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
0 all tests passed <br>
2 at least one test skipped <br>
4 at least one test failed <br>
6 at least one test failed and at least one test skipped
<br>
8 no tests in this package <br>
12 erroneous package <br>
16 testbed failure <br>
20 other unexpected failures including bad usage</p>
