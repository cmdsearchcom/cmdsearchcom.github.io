Network Audio System - a portable, network-transparent audio system
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
The Network Audio System service is a network-transparent system developed at
  Network Computing Devices for playing, recording, and manipulating audio data
  over a network. It uses the client/server model to separate application code
  from the software drivers needed to control specific audio input and output
  devices.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
The Network Audio System service provides applications with the ability to send
  and receive audio data such as voice, sound effects, and music in a network
  environment. A audio server inside the desktop terminal or personal computer
  controls the various input and output devices in response to messages sent
  from client programs running on other hosts.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A variety of utility programs are provided that can be used to play or record
  audio using shell scripts or command-line procedures. More ambitious
  applications can communicate directly with the audio server using a C-language
  programming library.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The Network Audio System service supports a variety of the common formats used
  to store sound data. Audio inputs and outputs can run at a any of a range of
  sampling rates. The audio server automatically converts all data to the
  designed format or rate.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Streams of data from multiple inputs can be mixed together and directed to any
  attached output device. Sounds that are used many times can be stored in the
  server so that they do not need to be transmitted over the network each time
  they are played. Furthermore, inputs can be hooked directly to outputs (for
  example, a CD player can be connected to a set of speakers) so that data can
  be played without requiring any client intervention or network traffic.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="AUDIO_SERVER_NAMES"><a class="selflink" href="#AUDIO_SERVER_NAMES">AUDIO
  SERVER NAMES</a></h1>
Each audio server has a name that is used by applications in establishing a
  connection. The format of the name depends upon the type of network being
  used. In TCP/IP environments, audio server names look like:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
tcp/ <i>hostname</i>:<i>portnum</i>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
</div>
where <i>hostname</i> is the name or numeric IP address of the desktop machine
  to be contacted and <i>portnum</i> is the port number on which the server is
  listening. If the ``tcp/'' prefix is not given, 8000 is automatically added to
  <i>portnum</i> so that the audio server name is compatible with the X Window
  System display name.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In DECnet environments, audio server names look like:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
decnet/ <i>nodename</i>::<i>num</i>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
</div>
where <i>nodename</i> is the name or numeric DECnet address of the desktop
  machine to be contacted and <i>num</i> is the DECnet task AUDIO$<i>num</i>. If
  the ``decnet/'' prefix is omitted, it is automatically added so that the audio
  server name is compatible with the X Window System display name.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Most audio utilities accept a command line argument <i>-audio servername</i> for
  specifying the audio server to be contacted.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
    % auinfo -audio tcp/ncdunit:8000
</pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If no server is specified on the command line, the AUDIOSERVER environment
  variable is checked to see if a name has been stored there. Otherwise, the
  DISPLAY environment variable used by X Window System applications is checked
  and the corresponding audio server is used.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SAMPLE_PROGRAMS"><a class="selflink" href="#SAMPLE_PROGRAMS">SAMPLE
  PROGRAMS</a></h1>
Several sample programs that use the Network Audio System service are provided
  by NCD:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>auplay</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This program simply plays the files listed on its command
      line. It is typically used from shell scripts, command-line procedures, or
      other programs that just need to ``dump'' sound data to the audio
    server.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>audemo</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This program allows the user to select and play
      pre-recorded sound files or to record new sound files. It provides a
      simple control panel for dynamically changing the volume while a sound is
      being played and for aborting a sound.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>audial</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This program generates North American telephone touch tones

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="AUDIO_FILES"><a class="selflink" href="#AUDIO_FILES">AUDIO
  FILES</a></h1>
The audio programming library and utility programs can be used to read and write
  files in any of the following file formats:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Sun/NeXT</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">These files typically have a '.au' or '.snd' extension.
      They are usually produced by Sun or NeXT workstations.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Creative Labs</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">These files typically have a '.voc' extension. They are
      usually produced by by Soundblaster audio cards on IBM PC compatible
      computers.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Microsoft WAVE</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">These files typically have a '.wav' extension. They are
      usually produced by IBM PC compatible computers.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>AIFF</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    These files typically have an '.aiff' or '.aif' extension. They are usually
      produced by SGI workstations or Apple computers.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Amiga IFF/8SVX</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">These files typically have an '.iff' extension.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Due to the nature of the file formats, only the Sun/NeXT file format can be
  piped through standard input and/or standard output. The convention for
  specifying standard input or standard output is to use a hyphen
  (&quot;-&quot;) as the file name.
