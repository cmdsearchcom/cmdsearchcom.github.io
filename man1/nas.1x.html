<p>NETWORK AUDIO SYSTEM(1) General Commands Manual NETWORK
AUDIO SYSTEM(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
Network Audio System - a portable, network-transparent audio
system</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
The Network Audio System service is a network-transparent
system developed at Network Computing Devices for playing,
recording, and manipulating audio data over a network. It
<br>
uses the client/server model to separate application code
from the software drivers needed to control specific audio
input and output devices.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The Network Audio System service provides applications with
the ability to send and receive audio data such as voice,
sound effects, and music in a network environment. A audio
<br>
server inside the desktop terminal or personal computer
controls the various input and output devices in response to
messages sent from client programs running on other
hosts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A variety of utility programs
are provided that can be used to play or record audio using
shell scripts or command-line procedures. More ambitious
applications can communicate <br>
directly with the audio server using a C-language
programming library.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Network Audio System service
supports a variety of the common formats used to store sound
data. Audio inputs and outputs can run at a any of a range
of sampling rates. The <br>
audio server automatically converts all data to the designed
format or rate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Streams of data from multiple
inputs can be mixed together and directed to any attached
output device. Sounds that are used many times can be stored
in the server so that they <br>
do not need to be transmitted over the network each time
they are played. Furthermore, inputs can be hooked directly
to outputs (for example, a CD player can be connected to a
<br>
set of speakers) so that data can be played without
requiring any client intervention or network traffic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUDIO SERVER NAMES <br>
Each audio server has a name that is used by applications in
establishing a connection. The format of the name depends
upon the type of network being used. In TCP/IP
environ&acirc; <br>
ments, audio server names look like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tcp/hostname:portnum</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where hostname is the name or
numeric IP address of the desktop machine to be contacted
and portnum is the port number on which the server is
listening. If the &lsquo;&lsquo;tcp/&rsquo;&rsquo; prefix
<br>
is not given, 8000 is automatically added to portnum so that
the audio server name is compatible with the X Window System
display name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In DECnet environments, audio
server names look like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">decnet/nodename::num</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where nodename is the name or
numeric DECnet address of the desktop machine to be
contacted and num is the DECnet task AUDIO$num. If the
&lsquo;&lsquo;decnet/&rsquo;&rsquo; prefix is omitted, it is
<br>
automatically added so that the audio server name is
compatible with the X Window System display name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most audio utilities accept a
command line argument -audio servername for specifying the
audio server to be contacted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% auinfo -audio
tcp/ncdunit:8000</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no server is specified on the
command line, the AUDIOSERVER environment variable is
checked to see if a name has been stored there. Otherwise,
the DISPLAY environment vari&acirc; <br>
able used by X Window System applications is checked and the
corresponding audio server is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SAMPLE PROGRAMS <br>
Several sample programs that use the Network Audio System
service are provided by NCD:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">auplay This program simply plays
the files listed on its command line. It is typically used
from shell scripts, command-line procedures, or other
programs that just need to <br>
&lsquo;&lsquo;dump&rsquo;&rsquo; sound data to the audio
server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">audemo This program allows the
user to select and play pre-recorded sound files or to
record new sound files. It provides a simple control panel
for dynamically changing the <br>
volume while a sound is being played and for aborting a
sound.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">audial This program generates
North American telephone touch tones correspond to a given
string. audial can also recognize touch tones and produce
the corresponding string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">autool This program is
compatible with the Sun audiotool program and is typically
used to play prerecorded sound files. Unlike auplay it
provides a graphical interface to allow <br>
the user to replay or cancel the data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">auinfo This program lists
information describing the capabilities of an audio
server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">auctl This program can be used
to change various device parameters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">auscope This program is an audio
protocol filter that can be used to view the network packets
being sent between an application and an audio server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">aupanel This program provides an
X-based window-oriented interface allowing the user to
adjust the attributes of the devices provided by the Network
Audio System service.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">auedit This program provides an
X-based window-oriented interface allowing the user to edit
audio files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">auconvert <br>
This program allows the user to perform various conversion
operations on sound files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">auphone This program provides an
X-based window-oriented interface allowing two-way real time
voice communication between two audio servers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">aurecord <br>
This program is used to record audio data from an audio
server into a file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">auwave This program provides an
X-based window-oriented interface demonstrating the use of
waveform elements.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUDIO FILES <br>
The audio programming library and utility programs can be
used to read and write files in any of the following file
formats:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sun/NeXT <br>
These files typically have a &rsquo;.au&rsquo; or
&rsquo;.snd&rsquo; extension. They are usually produced by
Sun or NeXT workstations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Creative Labs <br>
These files typically have a &rsquo;.voc&rsquo; extension.
They are usually produced by by Soundblaster audio cards on
IBM PC compatible computers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Microsoft WAVE <br>
These files typically have a &rsquo;.wav&rsquo; extension.
They are usually produced by IBM PC compatible
computers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AIFF <br>
These files typically have an &rsquo;.aiff&rsquo; or
&rsquo;.aif&rsquo; extension. They are usually produced by
SGI workstations or Apple computers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Amiga IFF/8SVX <br>
These files typically have an &rsquo;.iff&rsquo;
extension.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Due to the nature of the file
formats, only the Sun/NeXT file format can be piped through
standard input and/or standard output. The convention for
specifying standard input or <br>
standard output is to use a hyphen (&quot;-&quot;) as the
file name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROGRAMMING <br>
Application developers may create their own audio clients
using the Network Audio System programming library.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
The following environment variables are used by Network
Audio System programs:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUDIOSERVER <br>
This specifies the name of default audio server to contact
if no name is explicitly given on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DISPLAY This specifies the name
of an X Window System display that should be assumed to also
have a corresponding Network Audio System server.</p>
