perl5005delta - what's new for perl5.005
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
This document describes differences between the 5.004 release and this one.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="About_the_new_versioning_system"><a class="selflink" href="#About_the_new_versioning_system">About
  the new versioning system</a></h1>
Perl is now developed on two tracks: a maintenance track that makes small, safe
  updates to released production versions with emphasis on compatibility; and a
  development track that pursues more aggressive evolution. Maintenance releases
  (which should be considered production quality) have subversion numbers that
  run from 1 to 49, and development releases (which should be considered
  &quot;alpha&quot; quality) run from 50 to 99.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Perl 5.005 is the combined product of the new dual-track development scheme.

  This version is not binary compatible with Perl 5.004.</a></h2>
Starting with Perl 5.004_50 there were many deep and far-reaching changes to the
  language internals. If you have dynamically loaded extensions that you built
  under perl 5.003 or 5.004, you can continue to use them with 5.004, but you
  will need to rebuild and reinstall those extensions to use them 5.005. See
  <i>INSTALL</i> for detailed instructions on how to upgrade.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Default_installation_structure_has_changed"><a class="selflink" href="#Default_installation_structure_has_changed">Default
  installation structure has changed</a></h2>
The new Configure defaults are designed to allow a smooth upgrade from 5.004 to
  5.005, but you should read <i>INSTALL</i> for a detailed discussion of the
  changes in order to adapt them to your system.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Perl_Source_Compatibility"><a class="selflink" href="#Perl_Source_Compatibility">Perl
  Source Compatibility</a></h2>
When none of the experimental features are enabled, there should be very few
  user-visible Perl source compatibility issues.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If threads are enabled, then some caveats apply. @_ and $_ become lexical
  variables. The effect of this should be largely transparent to the user, but
  there are some boundary conditions under which user will need to be aware of
  the issues. For example, &quot;local(@_)&quot; results in a &quot;Can't
  localize lexical variable @_ ...&quot; message. This may be enabled in a
  future version.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Some new keywords have been introduced. These are generally expected to have
  very little impact on compatibility. See &quot;New &quot;INIT&quot;
  keyword&quot;, &quot;New &quot;lock&quot; keyword&quot;, and &quot;New
  &quot;qr//&quot; operator&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Certain barewords are now reserved. Use of these will provoke a warning if you
  have asked for them with the &quot;-w&quot; switch. See &quot;&quot;our&quot;
  is now a reserved word&quot;.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="C_Source_Compatibility"><a class="selflink" href="#C_Source_Compatibility">C

There have been a large number of changes in the internals to support the new
  features in this release.

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    All Perl global variables that are visible for use by extensions now have a
      &quot;PL_&quot; prefix. New extensions should &quot;not&quot; refer to
      perl globals by their unqualified names. To preserve sanity, we provide
      limited backward compatibility for globals that are being widely used like
      &quot;sv_undef&quot; and &quot;na&quot; (which should now be written as
      &quot;PL_sv_undef&quot;, &quot;PL_na&quot; etc.)
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If you find that your XS extension does not compile anymore because a perl

      and rebuild.

    It is strongly recommended that all functions in the Perl API that don't
      begin with &quot;perl&quot; be referenced with a &quot;Perl_&quot; prefix.
      The bare function names without the &quot;Perl_&quot; prefix are supported
      with macros, but this support may cease in a future release.

  <dd class="It-tag">Enabling threads has source compatibility issues

    Perl built with threading enabled requires extensions to use the new
      &quot;dTHR&quot; macro to initialize the handle to access per-thread data.
      If you see a compiler error that talks about the variable &quot;thr&quot;
      not being declared (when building a module that has XS code), you need to
      add &quot;dTHR;&quot; at the beginning of the block that elicited the
      error.

    The API function &quot;perl_get_sv(&quot;@&quot;,GV_ADD)&quot; should be
      used instead of directly accessing perl globals as
      &quot;GvSV(errgv)&quot;. The API call is backward compatible with existing
      perls and provides source compatibility with threading is enabled.

</dl>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Binary_Compatibility"><a class="selflink" href="#Binary_Compatibility">Binary
  Compatibility</a></h2>
This version is NOT binary compatible with older versions. All extensions will
  need to be recompiled. Further binaries built with threads enabled are
  incompatible with binaries built without. This should largely be transparent
  to the user, as all binary incompatible configurations have their own unique
  architecture name, and extension binaries get installed at unique locations.
  This allows coexistence of several configurations in the same directory
  hierarchy. See <i>INSTALL</i>.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Security_fixes_may_affect_compatibility"><a class="selflink" href="#Security_fixes_may_affect_compatibility">Security
  fixes may affect compatibility</a></h2>
A few taint leaks and taint omissions have been corrected. This may lead to
  &quot;failure&quot; of scripts that used to work with older versions.
  Compiling with -DINCOMPLETE_TAINTS provides a perl with minimal amounts of
  changes to the tainting behavior. But note that the resulting perl will have
  known insecurities.

Many new warnings that were introduced in 5.004 have been made optional. Some of
  these warnings are still present, but perl's new features make them less often
  a problem. See &quot;New Diagnostics&quot;.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Licensing"><a class="selflink" href="#Licensing">Licensing</a></h2>
Perl has a new Social Contract for contributors. See <i>Porting/Contract</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The license included in much of the Perl documentation has changed. Most of the
  Perl documentation was previously under the implicit GNU General Public
  License or the Artistic License (at the user's choice). Now much of the
  documentation unambiguously states the terms under which it may be
  distributed. Those terms are in general much less restrictive than the GNU
  GPL. See perl and the individual perl manpages listed therein.

WARNING: Threading is considered an <b>experimental</b> feature. Details of the
  implementation may change without notice. There are known limitations and some
  bugs. These are expected to be fixed in future versions.
<div class="Pp"></div>
See <i>README.threads</i>.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Compiler"><a class="selflink" href="#Compiler">Compiler</a></h2>
WARNING: The Compiler and related tools are considered <b>experimental</b>.
  Features may change without notice, and there are known limitations and bugs.
  Since the compiler is fully external to perl, the default configuration will
  build and install it.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The Compiler produces three different types of transformations of a perl
  program. The C backend generates C code that captures perl's state just before
  execution begins. It eliminates the compile-time overheads of the regular perl
  interpreter, but the run-time performance remains comparatively the same. The
  CC backend generates optimized C code equivalent to the code path at run-time.
  The CC backend has greater potential for big optimizations, but only a few
  optimizations are implemented currently. The Bytecode backend generates a
  platform independent bytecode representation of the interpreter's state just
  before execution. Thus, the Bytecode back end also eliminates much of the
  compilation overhead of the interpreter.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The compiler comes with several valuable utilities.
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;B::Lint&quot; is an experimental module to detect and warn about
  suspicious code, especially the cases that the &quot;-w&quot; switch does not
  detect.
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;B::Deparse&quot; can be used to demystify perl code, and understand how
  perl optimizes certain constructs.
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;B::Xref&quot; generates cross reference reports of all definition and use
  of variables, subroutines and formats in a program.
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;B::Showlex&quot; show the lexical variables used by a subroutine or file
  at a glance.
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;perlcc&quot; is a simple frontend for compiling perl.

See &quot;ext/B/README&quot;, B, and the respective compiler modules.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Regular_Expressions"><a class="selflink" href="#Regular_Expressions">Regular

Perl's regular expression engine has been seriously overhauled, and many new

<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Quicksort_is_internally_implemented"><a class="selflink" href="#Quicksort_is_internally_implemented">Quicksort
  is internally implemented</a></h2>
Perl now contains its own highly optimized <i>qsort()</i> routine. The new
  <i>qsort()</i> is resistant to inconsistent comparison functions, so Perl's
  &quot;sort()&quot; will not provoke coredumps any more when given poorly
  written sort subroutines. (Some C library &quot;qsort()&quot;s that were being
  used before used to have this problem.) In our testing, the new
  &quot;qsort()&quot; required the minimal number of pair-wise compares on
  average, among all known &quot;qsort()&quot; implementations.
<div class="Pp"></div>
See &quot;perlfunc/sort&quot;.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Reliable_signals"><a class="selflink" href="#Reliable_signals">Reliable
  signals</a></h2>
Perl's signal handling is susceptible to random crashes, because signals arrive
  asynchronously, and the Perl runtime is not reentrant at arbitrary times.
<div class="Pp"></div>
However, one experimental implementation of reliable signals is available when
  threads are enabled. See &quot;Thread::Signal&quot;. Also see <i>INSTALL</i>
  for how to build a Perl capable of threads.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Reliable_stack_pointers"><a class="selflink" href="#Reliable_stack_pointers">Reliable
  stack pointers</a></h2>
The internals now reallocate the perl stack only at predictable times. In
  particular, magic calls never trigger reallocations of the stack, because all
  reentrancy of the runtime is handled using a &quot;stack of stacks&quot;. This
  should improve reliability of cached stack pointers in the internals and in
  XSUBs.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="More_generous_treatment_of_carriage_returns"><a class="selflink" href="#More_generous_treatment_of_carriage_returns">More
  generous treatment of carriage returns</a></h2>
Perl used to complain if it encountered literal carriage returns in scripts. Now
  they are mostly treated like whitespace within program text. Inside string
  literals and here documents, literal carriage returns are ignored if they
  occur paired with linefeeds, or get interpreted as whitespace if they stand
  alone. This behavior means that literal carriage returns in files should be
  avoided. You can get the older, more compatible (but less generous) behavior
  by defining the preprocessor symbol &quot;PERL_STRICT_CR&quot; when building
  perl. Of course, all this has nothing whatever to do with how escapes like
  &quot;\r&quot; are handled within strings.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that this doesn't somehow magically allow you to keep all text files in DOS
  format. The generous treatment only applies to files that perl itself parses.
  If your C compiler doesn't allow carriage returns in files, you may still be
  unable to build modules that need a C compiler.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Memory_leaks"><a class="selflink" href="#Memory_leaks">Memory
  leaks</a></h2>
&quot;substr&quot;, &quot;pos&quot; and &quot;vec&quot; don't leak memory
  anymore when used in lvalue context. Many small leaks that impacted
  applications that embed multiple interpreters have been fixed.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Better_support_for_multiple_interpreters"><a class="selflink" href="#Better_support_for_multiple_interpreters">Better
  support for multiple interpreters</a></h2>
The build-time option &quot;-DMULTIPLICITY&quot; has had many of the details
  reworked. Some previously global variables that should have been
  per-interpreter now are. With care, this allows interpreters to call each
  other. See the &quot;PerlInterp&quot; extension on CPAN.

  (1..1000000)&quot; optimized</a></h2>
&quot;foreach (1..1000000)&quot; is now optimized into a counting loop. It does

  can be used as implicitly quoted package name</a></h2>
Barewords caused unintuitive behavior when a subroutine with the same name as a
  package happened to be defined. Thus, &quot;new Foo @args&quot;, use the
  result of the call to &quot;Foo()&quot; instead of &quot;Foo&quot; being
  treated as a literal. The recommended way to write barewords in the indirect
  object slot is &quot;new Foo:: @args&quot;. Note that the method
  &quot;new()&quot; is called with a first argument of &quot;Foo&quot;, not
  &quot;Foo::&quot; when you do that.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="&quot;exists_$Foo::{Bar::}&quot;_tests_existence_of_a_package"><a class="selflink" href="#&quot;exists_$Foo::{Bar::}&quot;_tests_existence_of_a_package">&quot;exists
  $Foo::{Bar::}&quot; tests existence of a package</a></h2>
It was impossible to test for the existence of a package without actually
  creating it before. Now &quot;exists $Foo::{Bar::}&quot; can be used to test
  if the &quot;Foo::Bar&quot; namespace has been created.

Perl5 has always had 64-bit support on systems with 64-bit longs. Starting with
  5.005, the beginnings of experimental support for systems with 32-bit long and
  64-bit 'long long' integers has been added. If you add -DUSE_LONG_LONG to your
  ccflags in config.sh (or manually define it in perl.h) then perl will be built
  with 'long long' support. There will be many compiler warnings, and the
  resultant perl may not work on all systems. There are many other issues
  related to third-party extensions and libraries. This option exists to allow
  people to work on those issues.

&quot;INIT&quot; subs are like &quot;BEGIN&quot; and &quot;END&quot;, but they
  get run just before the perl runtime begins execution. e.g., the Perl Compiler
  makes use of &quot;INIT&quot; blocks to initialize and resolve pointers to
  XSUBs.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="New_&quot;lock&quot;_keyword"><a class="selflink" href="#New_&quot;lock&quot;_keyword">New

The &quot;lock&quot; keyword is the fundamental synchronization primitive in
  threaded perl. When threads are not enabled, it is currently a noop.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To minimize impact on source compatibility this keyword is &quot;weak&quot;,
  i.e., any user-defined subroutine of the same name overrides it, unless a

The &quot;qr//&quot; operator, which is syntactically similar to the other
  quote-like operators, is used to create precompiled regular expressions. This
  compiled form can now be explicitly passed around in variables, and
  interpolated in other regular expressions. See perlop.

Calling a subroutine with the name &quot;our&quot; will now provoke a warning
  when using the &quot;-w&quot; switch.

Several missing hooks have been added. There is also a new base class for
  TIEARRAY implementations. See Tie::Array.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="4th_argument_to_substr"><a class="selflink" href="#4th_argument_to_substr">4th
  argument to substr</a></h2>
<i>substr()</i> can now both return and replace in one operation. The optional
  4th argument is the replacement string. See &quot;substr&quot; in perlfunc.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Negative_LENGTH_argument_to_splice"><a class="selflink" href="#Negative_LENGTH_argument_to_splice">Negative
  LENGTH argument to splice</a></h2>
<i>splice()</i> with a negative LENGTH argument now work similar to what the
  LENGTH did for <i>substr()</i>. Previously a negative LENGTH was treated as 0.
  See &quot;splice&quot; in perlfunc.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Magic_lvalues_are_now_more_magical"><a class="selflink" href="#Magic_lvalues_are_now_more_magical">Magic
  lvalues are now more magical</a></h2>
When you say something like &quot;substr($x, 5) = &quot;hi&quot;&quot;, the
  scalar returned by <i>substr()</i> is special, in that any modifications to it
  affect $x. (This is called a 'magic lvalue' because an 'lvalue' is something
  on the left side of an assignment.) Normally, this is exactly what you would
  expect to happen, but Perl uses the same magic if you use <i>substr()</i>,
  <i>pos()</i>, or <i>vec()</i> in a context where they might be modified, like
  taking a reference with &quot;\&quot; or as an argument to a sub that modifies
  @_. In previous versions, this 'magic' only went one way, but now changes to
  the scalar the magic refers to ($x in the above example) affect the magic
  lvalue too. For instance, this code now acts differently:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    $x = &quot;hello&quot;;
    sub printit {
        $x = &quot;g'bye&quot;;
        print $_[0], &quot;\n&quot;;
    }
    printit(substr($x, 0, 5));
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
In previous versions, this would print &quot;hello&quot;, but it now prints
  &quot;g'bye&quot;.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="&lt;&gt;_now_reads_in_records"><a class="selflink" href="#&lt;&gt;_now_reads_in_records">&lt;&gt;
  now reads in records</a></h2>
If $/ is a reference to an integer, or a scalar that holds an integer, &lt;&gt;
  will read in records instead of lines. For more info, see &quot;$/&quot; in
  perlvar.

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
       perl: warning: Setting locale failed.
       perl: warning: Please check that your locale settings:
               LC_ALL = &quot;En_US&quot;,
               LANG = (unset)
           are supported and installed on your system.
       perl: warning: Falling back to the standard locale (&quot;C&quot;).
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Exactly what were the failed locale settings varies. In the above the
      settings were that the LC_ALL was &quot;En_US&quot; and the LANG had no
      value. This error means that Perl detected that you and/or your system
      administrator have set up the so-called variable system but Perl could not
      use those settings. This was not dead serious, fortunately: there is a
      &quot;default locale&quot; called &quot;C&quot; that Perl can and will
      use, the script will be run. Before you really fix the problem, however,
      you will get the same error message each time you run Perl. How to really
      fix the problem can be found in &quot;LOCALE PROBLEMS&quot; in
    perllocale.</dd>

  <dt class="It-tag">regexp too big</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">(F) The current implementation of regular expressions uses
      shorts as address offsets within a string. Unfortunately this means that
      if the regular expression compiles to longer than 32767, it'll blow up.
      Usually when you want a regular expression this big, there is a better way
      to do it with multiple statements. See perlre.</dd>

You can use &quot;Configure -Uinstallusrbinperl&quot; which causes installperl
  to skip installing perl also as /usr/bin/perl. This is useful if you prefer
  not to modify /usr/bin for some reason or another but harmful because many
  scripts assume to find Perl in /usr/bin/perl.
