<p>PERL5005DELTA(1) Perl Programmers Reference Guide
PERL5005DELTA(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
perl5005delta - what&rsquo;s new for perl5.005</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This document describes differences between the 5.004
release and this one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">About the new versioning system
<br>
Perl is now developed on two tracks: a maintenance track
that makes small, safe updates to released production
versions with emphasis on compatibility; and a development
track <br>
that pursues more aggressive evolution. Maintenance releases
(which should be considered production quality) have
subversion numbers that run from 1 to 49, and development
<br>
releases (which should be considered &quot;alpha&quot;
quality) run from 50 to 99.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl 5.005 is the combined
product of the new dual-track development scheme.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Incompatible Changes <br>
WARNING: This version is not binary compatible with Perl
5.004. <br>
Starting with Perl 5.004_50 there were many deep and
far-reaching changes to the language internals. If you have
dynamically loaded extensions that you built under perl
5.003 or <br>
5.004, you can continue to use them with 5.004, but you will
need to rebuild and reinstall those extensions to use them
5.005. See INSTALL for detailed instructions on how to <br>
upgrade.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default installation structure
has changed <br>
The new Configure defaults are designed to allow a smooth
upgrade from 5.004 to 5.005, but you should read INSTALL for
a detailed discussion of the changes in order to adapt them
<br>
to your system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl Source Compatibility <br>
When none of the experimental features are enabled, there
should be very few user-visible Perl source compatibility
issues.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If threads are enabled, then
some caveats apply. @_ and $_ become lexical variables. The
effect of this should be largely transparent to the user,
but there are some boundary <br>
conditions under which user will need to be aware of the
issues. For example, &quot;local(@_)&quot; results in a
&quot;Can&rsquo;t localize lexical variable @_ ...&quot;
message. This may be enabled in <br>
a future version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some new keywords have been
introduced. These are generally expected to have very little
impact on compatibility. See &quot;New &quot;INIT&quot;
keyword&quot;, &quot;New &quot;lock&quot; keyword&quot;, and
&quot;New <br>
&quot;qr//&quot; operator&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Certain barewords are now
reserved. Use of these will provoke a warning if you have
asked for them with the &quot;-w&quot; switch. See
&quot;&quot;our&quot; is now a reserved word&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C Source Compatibility <br>
There have been a large number of changes in the internals
to support the new features in this release.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Core sources now
require ANSI C compiler</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An ANSI C compiler is now
required to build perl. See INSTALL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; All Perl global
variables must now be referenced with an explicit prefix</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All Perl global variables that
are visible for use by extensions now have a &quot;PL_&quot;
prefix. New extensions should &quot;not&quot; refer to perl
globals by their unqualified names. To <br>
preserve sanity, we provide limited backward compatibility
for globals that are being widely used like
&quot;sv_undef&quot; and &quot;na&quot; (which should now be
written as &quot;PL_sv_undef&quot;, <br>
&quot;PL_na&quot; etc.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you find that your XS
extension does not compile anymore because a perl global is
not visible, try adding a &quot;PL_&quot; prefix to the
global and rebuild.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is strongly recommended that
all functions in the Perl API that don&rsquo;t begin with
&quot;perl&quot; be referenced with a &quot;Perl_&quot;
prefix. The bare function names without the
&quot;Perl_&quot; <br>
prefix are supported with macros, but this support may cease
in a future release.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See perlapi.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Enabling threads
has source compatibility issues</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl built with threading
enabled requires extensions to use the new &quot;dTHR&quot;
macro to initialize the handle to access per-thread data. If
you see a compiler error that talks <br>
about the variable &quot;thr&quot; not being declared (when
building a module that has XS code), you need to add
&quot;dTHR;&quot; at the beginning of the block that
elicited the error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The API function
&quot;perl_get_sv(&quot;@&quot;,GV_ADD)&quot; should be used
instead of directly accessing perl globals as
&quot;GvSV(errgv)&quot;. The API call is backward compatible
with existing <br>
perls and provides source compatibility with threading is
enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See &quot;C Source
Compatibility&quot; for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Binary Compatibility <br>
This version is NOT binary compatible with older versions.
All extensions will need to be recompiled. Further binaries
built with threads enabled are incompatible with binaries
<br>
built without. This should largely be transparent to the
user, as all binary incompatible configurations have their
own unique architecture name, and extension binaries get
<br>
installed at unique locations. This allows coexistence of
several configurations in the same directory hierarchy. See
INSTALL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Security fixes may affect
compatibility <br>
A few taint leaks and taint omissions have been corrected.
This may lead to &quot;failure&quot; of scripts that used to
work with older versions. Compiling with -DINCOMPLETE_TAINTS
<br>
provides a perl with minimal amounts of changes to the
tainting behavior. But note that the resulting perl will
have known insecurities.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Oneliners with the
&quot;-e&quot; switch do not create temporary files
anymore.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Relaxed new mandatory warnings
introduced in 5.004 <br>
Many new warnings that were introduced in 5.004 have been
made optional. Some of these warnings are still present, but
perl&rsquo;s new features make them less often a problem.
See <br>
&quot;New Diagnostics&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Licensing <br>
Perl has a new Social Contract for contributors. See
Porting/Contract.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The license included in much of
the Perl documentation has changed. Most of the Perl
documentation was previously under the implicit GNU General
Public License or the Artistic <br>
License (at the user&rsquo;s choice). Now much of the
documentation unambiguously states the terms under which it
may be distributed. Those terms are in general much less
restrictive <br>
than the GNU GPL. See perl and the individual perl manpages
listed therein.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Core Changes <br>
Threads <br>
WARNING: Threading is considered an experimental feature.
Details of the implementation may change without notice.
There are known limitations and some bugs. These are <br>
expected to be fixed in future versions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See README.threads.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Compiler <br>
WARNING: The Compiler and related tools are considered
experimental. Features may change without notice, and there
are known limitations and bugs. Since the compiler is fully
<br>
external to perl, the default configuration will build and
install it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Compiler produces three
different types of transformations of a perl program. The C
backend generates C code that captures perl&rsquo;s state
just before execution begins. It <br>
eliminates the compile-time overheads of the regular perl
interpreter, but the run-time performance remains
comparatively the same. The CC backend generates optimized C
code <br>
equivalent to the code path at run-time. The CC backend has
greater potential for big optimizations, but only a few
optimizations are implemented currently. The Bytecode <br>
backend generates a platform independent bytecode
representation of the interpreter&rsquo;s state just before
execution. Thus, the Bytecode back end also eliminates much
of the <br>
compilation overhead of the interpreter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The compiler comes with several
valuable utilities.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;B::Lint&quot; is an
experimental module to detect and warn about suspicious
code, especially the cases that the &quot;-w&quot; switch
does not detect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;B::Deparse&quot; can be
used to demystify perl code, and understand how perl
optimizes certain constructs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;B::Xref&quot; generates
cross reference reports of all definition and use of
variables, subroutines and formats in a program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;B::Showlex&quot; show the
lexical variables used by a subroutine or file at a
glance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;perlcc&quot; is a simple
frontend for compiling perl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See &quot;ext/B/README&quot;, B,
and the respective compiler modules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Regular Expressions <br>
Perl&rsquo;s regular expression engine has been seriously
overhauled, and many new constructs are supported. Several
bugs have been fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here is an itemized summary:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Many new and improved
optimizations <br>
Changes in the RE engine:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unneeded nodes removed; <br>
Substrings merged together; <br>
New types of nodes to process (SUBEXPR)* and similar
expressions <br>
quickly, used if the SUBEXPR has no side effects and matches
<br>
strings of the same length; <br>
Better optimizations by lookup for constant substrings; <br>
Better search for constants substrings anchored by $ ;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Changes in Perl code using RE
engine:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">More optimizations to
s/longer/short/; <br>
study() was not working; <br>
/blah/ may be optimized to an analogue of index() if $&amp;
$&lsquo; $&rsquo; not seen; <br>
Unneeded copying of matched-against string removed; <br>
Only matched part of the string is copying if $&lsquo;
$&rsquo; were not seen;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Many bug fixes <br>
Note that only the major bug fixes are listed here. See
Changes for others.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Backtracking might not restore
start of $3. <br>
No feedback if max count for * or + on &quot;complex&quot;
subexpression <br>
was reached, similarly (but at compile time) for {3,34567}
<br>
Primitive restrictions on max count introduced to decrease a
<br>
possibility of a segfault; <br>
(ZERO-LENGTH)* could segfault; <br>
(ZERO-LENGTH)* was prohibited; <br>
Long REs were not allowed; <br>
/RE/g could skip matches at the same position after a <br>
zero-length match;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">New regular expression
constructs <br>
The following new syntax elements are supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(?&lt;=RE) <br>
(?&lt;!RE) <br>
(?{ CODE }) <br>
(?i-x) <br>
(?i:RE) <br>
(?(COND)YES_RE|NO_RE) <br>
(?&gt;RE)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">New operator for precompiled
regular expressions <br>
See &quot;New &quot;qr//&quot; operator&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other improvements <br>
Better debugging output (possibly with colors), <br>
even from non-debugging Perl; <br>
RE engine code now looks like C, not like assembler; <br>
Behaviour of RE modifiable by &lsquo;use re&rsquo;
directive; <br>
Improved documentation; <br>
Test suite significantly extended; <br>
Syntax [:^upper:] etc., reserved inside character
classes;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Incompatible changes <br>
(?i) localized inside enclosing group; <br>
$( is not interpolated into RE any more; <br>
/RE/g may match at the same position (with non-zero length)
<br>
after a zero-length match (bug fix).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See perlre and perlop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Improved malloc() <br>
See banner at the beginning of &quot;malloc.c&quot; for
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Quicksort is internally
implemented <br>
Perl now contains its own highly optimized qsort() routine.
The new qsort() is resistant to inconsistent comparison
functions, so Perl&rsquo;s &quot;sort()&quot; will not
provoke coredumps any <br>
more when given poorly written sort subroutines. (Some C
library &quot;qsort()&quot;s that were being used before
used to have this problem.) In our testing, the new
&quot;qsort()&quot; required <br>
the minimal number of pair-wise compares on average, among
all known &quot;qsort()&quot; implementations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See
&quot;perlfunc/sort&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Reliable signals <br>
Perl&rsquo;s signal handling is susceptible to random
crashes, because signals arrive asynchronously, and the Perl
runtime is not reentrant at arbitrary times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, one experimental
implementation of reliable signals is available when threads
are enabled. See &quot;Thread::Signal&quot;. Also see
INSTALL for how to build a Perl capable of <br>
threads.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Reliable stack pointers <br>
The internals now reallocate the perl stack only at
predictable times. In particular, magic calls never trigger
reallocations of the stack, because all reentrancy of the
runtime <br>
is handled using a &quot;stack of stacks&quot;. This should
improve reliability of cached stack pointers in the
internals and in XSUBs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">More generous treatment of
carriage returns <br>
Perl used to complain if it encountered literal carriage
returns in scripts. Now they are mostly treated like
whitespace within program text. Inside string literals and
here <br>
documents, literal carriage returns are ignored if they
occur paired with linefeeds, or get interpreted as
whitespace if they stand alone. This behavior means that
literal <br>
carriage returns in files should be avoided. You can get the
older, more compatible (but less generous) behavior by
defining the preprocessor symbol &quot;PERL_STRICT_CR&quot;
when <br>
building perl. Of course, all this has nothing
whatever&quot; are handled within strings. to do with how
escapes like &quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that this doesn&rsquo;t
somehow magically allow you to keep all text files in DOS
format. The generous treatment only applies to files that
perl itself parses. If your C <br>
compiler doesn&rsquo;t allow carriage returns in files, you
may still be unable to build modules that need a C
compiler.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Memory leaks <br>
&quot;substr&quot;, &quot;pos&quot; and &quot;vec&quot;
don&rsquo;t leak memory anymore when used in lvalue context.
Many small leaks that impacted applications that embed
multiple interpreters have been fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Better support for multiple
interpreters <br>
The build-time option &quot;-DMULTIPLICITY&quot; has had
many of the details reworked. Some previously global
variables that should have been per-interpreter now are.
With care, this <br>
allows interpreters to call each other. See the
&quot;PerlInterp&quot; extension on CPAN.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Behavior of local() on array and
hash elements is now well-defined <br>
See &quot;Temporary Values via local()&quot; in perlsub.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;%!&quot; is transparently
tied to the Errno module <br>
See perlvar, and Errno.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pseudo-hashes are supported <br>
See perlref.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;EXPR foreach EXPR&quot; is
supported <br>
See perlsyn.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Keywords can be globally
overridden <br>
See perlsub.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$^E is meaningful on Win32 <br>
See perlvar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;foreach (1..1000000)&quot;
optimized <br>
&quot;foreach (1..1000000)&quot; is now optimized into a
counting loop. It does not try to allocate a 1000000-size
list anymore.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;Foo::&quot; can be used as
implicitly quoted package name <br>
Barewords caused unintuitive behavior when a subroutine with
the same name as a package happened to be defined. Thus,
&quot;new Foo @args&quot;, use the result of the call to
&quot;Foo()&quot; <br>
instead of &quot;Foo&quot; being treated as a literal. The
recommended way to write barewords in the indirect object
slot is &quot;new Foo:: @args&quot;. Note that the method
&quot;new()&quot; is called <br>
with a first argument of &quot;Foo&quot;, not
&quot;Foo::&quot; when you do that.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;exists $Foo::{Bar::}&quot;
tests existence of a package <br>
It was impossible to test for the existence of a package
without actually creating it before. Now &quot;exists
$Foo::{Bar::}&quot; can be used to test if the
&quot;Foo::Bar&quot; namespace has been <br>
created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Better locale support <br>
See perllocale.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Experimental support for 64-bit
platforms <br>
Perl5 has always had 64-bit support on systems with 64-bit
longs. Starting with 5.005, the beginnings of experimental
support for systems with 32-bit long and 64-bit &rsquo;long
long&rsquo; <br>
integers has been added. If you add -DUSE_LONG_LONG to your
ccflags in config.sh (or manually define it in perl.h) then
perl will be built with &rsquo;long long&rsquo; support.
There will <br>
be many compiler warnings, and the resultant perl may not
work on all systems. There are many other issues related to
third-party extensions and libraries. This option exists
<br>
to allow people to work on those issues.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">prototype() returns useful
results on builtins <br>
See &quot;prototype&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Extended support for exception
handling <br>
&quot;die()&quot; now accepts a reference value, and $@ gets
set to that value in exception traps. This makes it possible
to propagate exception objects. This is an undocumented <br>
experimental feature.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Re-blessing in DESTROY()
supported for chaining DESTROY() methods <br>
See &quot;Destructors&quot; in perlobj.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All &quot;printf&quot; format
conversions are handled internally <br>
See &quot;printf&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">New &quot;INIT&quot; keyword
<br>
&quot;INIT&quot; subs are like &quot;BEGIN&quot; and
&quot;END&quot;, but they get run just before the perl
runtime begins execution. e.g., the Perl Compiler makes use
of &quot;INIT&quot; blocks to initialize and <br>
resolve pointers to XSUBs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">New &quot;lock&quot; keyword
<br>
The &quot;lock&quot; keyword is the fundamental
synchronization primitive in threaded perl. When threads are
not enabled, it is currently a noop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To minimize impact on source
compatibility this keyword is &quot;weak&quot;, i.e., any
user-defined subroutine of the same name overrides it,
unless a &quot;use Thread&quot; has been seen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">New &quot;qr//&quot; operator
<br>
The &quot;qr//&quot; operator, which is syntactically
similar to the other quote-like operators, is used to create
precompiled regular expressions. This compiled form can now
be <br>
explicitly passed around in variables, and interpolated in
other regular expressions. See perlop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;our&quot; is now a
reserved word <br>
Calling a subroutine with the name &quot;our&quot; will now
provoke a warning when using the &quot;-w&quot; switch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tied arrays are now fully
supported <br>
See Tie::Array.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tied handles support is better
<br>
Several missing hooks have been added. There is also a new
base class for TIEARRAY implementations. See Tie::Array.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4th argument to substr <br>
substr() can now both return and replace in one operation.
The optional 4th argument is the replacement string. See
&quot;substr&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Negative LENGTH argument to
splice <br>
splice() with a negative LENGTH argument now work similar to
what the LENGTH did for substr(). Previously a negative
LENGTH was treated as 0. See &quot;splice&quot; in
perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Magic lvalues are now more
magical <br>
When you say something like &quot;substr($x, 5) =
&quot;hi&quot;&quot;, the scalar returned by substr() is
special, in that any modifications to it affect $x. (This is
called a &rsquo;magic lvalue&rsquo; <br>
because an &rsquo;lvalue&rsquo; is something on the left
side of an assignment.) Normally, this is exactly what you
would expect to happen, but Perl uses the same magic if you
use substr(), <br>
pos(), or vec() in a context where they might be modified,
like taking a reference with &quot; <br>
went one way, but now changes to the scalar the magic refers
to ($x in the above example) affect the magic lvalue too.
For instance, this code now acts differently:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$x = &quot;hello&quot;; <br>
sub printit { <br>
$x = &quot;g&rsquo;bye&quot;; <br>
print $_[0], &quot;0; <br>
} <br>
printit(substr($x, 0, 5));</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In previous versions, this would
print &quot;hello&quot;, but it now prints
&quot;g&rsquo;bye&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;&gt; now reads in records
<br>
If $/ is a reference to an integer, or a scalar that holds
an integer, &lt;&gt; will read in records instead of lines.
For more info, see &quot;$/&quot; in perlvar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Supported Platforms <br>
Configure has many incremental improvements. Site-wide
policy for building perl can now be made persistent, via
Policy.sh. Configure also records the command-line arguments
<br>
used in config.sh.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">New Platforms <br>
BeOS is now supported. See README.beos.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DOS is now supported under the
DJGPP tools. See README.dos (installed as perldos on some
systems).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">re Various pragmata to control
behavior of regular expressions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Changes in existing modules <br>
Benchmark <br>
You can now run tests for x seconds instead of guessing the
right number of tests to run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Keeps better time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Carp <br>
Carp has a new function cluck(). cluck() warns, like carp(),
but also adds a stack backtrace to the error message, like
confess().</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CGI CGI has been updated to
version 2.42.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fcntl <br>
More Fcntl constants added: F_SETLK64, F_SETLKW64,
O_LARGEFILE for large (more than 4G) file access (the 64-bit
support is not yet working, though, so no need to get overly
<br>
excited), Free/Net/OpenBSD locking behaviour flags F_FLOCK,
F_POSIX, Linux F_SHLCK, and O_ACCMODE: the mask of O_RDONLY,
O_WRONLY, and O_RDWR.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Math::Complex <br>
The accessors methods Re, Im, arg, abs, rho, theta, methods
can ($z-&gt;Re()) now also act as mutators
($z-&gt;Re(3)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Math::Trig <br>
A little bit of radial trigonometry (cylindrical and
spherical) added, for example the great circle distance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">POSIX <br>
POSIX now has its own platform-specific hints files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DB_File <br>
DB_File supports version 2.x of Berkeley DB. See
&quot;ext/DB_File/Changes&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MakeMaker <br>
MakeMaker now supports writing empty makefiles, provides a
way to specify that site umask() policy should be honored.
There is also better support for manipulation of <br>
.packlist files, and getting information about installed
modules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Extensions that have both
architecture-dependent and architecture-independent files
are now always installed completely in the
architecture-dependent locations. Previously, <br>
the shareable parts were shared both across architectures
and across perl versions and were therefore liable to be
overwritten with newer versions that might have subtle <br>
incompatibilities.</p>

See perlmodinstall and CPAN.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cwd Cwd::cwd is faster on most
platforms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Utility Changes <br>
&quot;h2ph&quot; and related utilities have been vastly
overhauled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;perlcc&quot;, a new
experimental front end for the compiler is available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The crude GNU
&quot;configure&quot; emulator is now called
&quot;configure.gnu&quot; to avoid trampling on
&quot;Configure&quot; under case-insensitive
filesystems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;perldoc&quot; used to be
rather slow. The slower features are now optional. In
particular, case-insensitive searches need the
&quot;-i&quot; switch, and recursive searches need
&quot;-r&quot;. You <br>
can set these switches in the &quot;PERLDOC&quot;
environment variable to get the old behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Documentation Changes <br>
Config.pm now has a glossary of variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Porting/patching.pod has
detailed instructions on how to create and submit patches
for perl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perlport specifies guidelines on

<p style="margin-top: 1em">New Diagnostics <br>
Ambiguous call resolved as CORE::%s(), qualify as such or
use &amp; <br>
(W) A subroutine you have declared has the same name as a
Perl keyword, and you have used the name without
qualification for calling one or the other. Perl decided to
call <br>
the builtin because the subroutine is not imported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To force interpretation as a
subroutine call, either put an ampersand before the
subroutine name, or qualify the name with its package.
Alternatively, you can import the <br>
subroutine (or pretend that it&rsquo;s imported with the
&quot;use subs&quot; pragma).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To silently interpret it as the
Perl operator, use the &quot;CORE::&quot; prefix on the
operator (e.g. &quot;CORE::log($x)&quot;) or by declaring
the subroutine to be an object method (see <br>
&quot;attrs&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bad index while coercing array
into hash <br>
(F) The index looked up in the hash found as the 0&rsquo;th
element of a pseudo-hash is not legal. Index values must be
at 1 or greater. See perlref.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bareword &quot;%s&quot; refers
to nonexistent package <br>
(W) You used a qualified bareword of the form
&quot;Foo::&quot;, but the compiler saw no other uses of
that namespace before that point. Perhaps you need to
predeclare a package?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t call method
&quot;%s&quot; on an undefined value <br>
(F) You used the syntax of a method call, but the slot
filled by the object reference or package name contains an
undefined value. Something like this will reproduce the <br>
error:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$BADREF = 42; <br>
process $BADREF 1,2,3; <br>
$BADREF-&gt;process(1,2,3);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t check filesystem of
script &quot;%s&quot; for nosuid <br>
(P) For some reason you can&rsquo;t check the filesystem of
the script for nosuid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t coerce array into
hash <br>
(F) You used an array where a hash was expected, but the
array has no information on how to map from keys to array
indices. You can do that only with arrays that have a hash
<br>
reference at index 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t goto subroutine from
an eval-string <br>
(F) The &quot;goto subroutine&quot; call can&rsquo;t be used
to jump out of an eval &quot;string&quot;. (You can use it
to jump out of an eval {BLOCK}, but you probably don&rsquo;t
want to.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t localize pseudo-hash
element <br>
(F) You said something like &quot;local
$ar-&gt;{&rsquo;key&rsquo;}&quot;, where $ar is a reference
to a pseudo-hash. That hasn&rsquo;t been implemented yet,
but you can get a similar effect by localizing <br>
the corresponding array element directly: &quot;local
$ar-&gt;[$ar-&gt;[0]{&rsquo;key&rsquo;}]&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t use %%! because
Errno.pm is not available <br>
(F) The first time the %! hash is used, perl automatically
loads the Errno.pm module. The Errno module is expected to
tie the %! hash to provide symbolic names for $! errno <br>
values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cannot find an opnumber for
&quot;%s&quot; <br>
(F) A string of a form &quot;CORE::word&quot; was given to
prototype(), but there is no builtin with the name
&quot;word&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Character class syntax [. .] is
reserved for future extensions <br>
(W) Within regular expression character classes ([]) the
syntax beginning with &quot;[.&quot; and ending with
&quot;.]&quot; is reserved for future extensions. If you
need to represent those <br>
character sequences inside a regular expression character
class, just quote the square brackets with the backslash:
&quot; <br>
Character class syntax [: :] is reserved for future
extensions <br>
(W) Within regular expression character classes ([]) the
syntax beginning with &quot;[:&quot; and ending with
&quot;:]&quot; is reserved for future extensions. If you
need to represent those <br>
character sequences inside a regular expression character
class, just quote the square brackets with the backslash:
&quot; <br>
Character class syntax [= =] is reserved for future
extensions <br>
(W) Within regular expression character classes ([]) the
syntax beginning with &quot;[=&quot; and ending with
&quot;=]&quot; is reserved for future extensions. If you
need to represent those <br>
character sequences inside a regular expression character
class, just quote the square brackets with the backslash:
&quot; <br>
%s: Eval-group in insecure regular expression <br>
(F) Perl detected tainted data when trying to compile a
regular expression that contains the &quot;(?{ ... })&quot;
zero-width assertion, which is unsafe. See &quot;(?{ code
})&quot; in perlre, <br>
and perlsec.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%s: Eval-group not allowed, use
re &rsquo;eval&rsquo; <br>
(F) A regular expression contained the &quot;(?{ ...
})&quot; zero-width assertion, but that construct is only
allowed when the &quot;use re &rsquo;eval&rsquo;&quot;
pragma is in effect. See &quot;(?{ code })&quot; <br>
in perlre.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%s: Eval-group not allowed at
run time <br>
(F) Perl tried to compile a regular expression containing
the &quot;(?{ ... })&quot; zero-width assertion at run time,
as it would when the pattern contains interpolated values.
Since <br>
that is a security risk, it is not allowed. If you insist,
you may still do this by explicitly building the pattern
from an interpolated string at run time and using that in
<br>
an eval(). See &quot;(?{ code })&quot; in perlre.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Explicit blessing to
&rsquo;&rsquo; (assuming package main) <br>
(W) You are blessing a reference to a zero length string.
This has the effect of blessing the reference into the
package main. This is usually not what you want. Consider
<br>
providing a default target package, e.g. bless($ref, $p ||
&rsquo;MyPackage&rsquo;);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Illegal hex digit ignored <br>
(W) You may have tried to use a character other than 0 - 9
or A - F in a hexadecimal number. Interpretation of the
hexadecimal number stopped before the illegal character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">No such array field <br>
(F) You tried to access an array as a hash, but the field
name used is not defined. The hash at index 0 should map all
valid field names to array indices for that to work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">No such field &quot;%s&quot; in
variable %s of type %s <br>
(F) You tried to access a field of a typed variable where
the type does not know about the field name. The field names
are looked up in the %FIELDS hash in the type package <br>
at compile time. The %FIELDS hash is usually set up with the
&rsquo;fields&rsquo; pragma.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Out of memory during
ridiculously large request <br>
(F) You can&rsquo;t allocate more than 2^31+&quot;small
amount&quot; bytes. This error is most likely to be caused
by a typo in the Perl program. e.g., $arr[time] instead of
$arr[$time].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Range iterator outside integer
range <br>
(F) One (or both) of the numeric arguments to the range
operator &quot;..&quot; are outside the range which can be
represented by integers internally. One possible workaround
is to <br>
force Perl to use magical string increment by prepending
&quot;0&quot; to your numbers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Recursive inheritance detected
while looking for method &rsquo;%s&rsquo; %s <br>
(F) More than 100 levels of inheritance were encountered
while invoking a method. Probably indicates an unintended
loop in your inheritance hierarchy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Reference found where even-sized
list expected <br>
(W) You gave a single reference where Perl was expecting a
list with an even number of elements (for assignment to a
hash). This usually means that you used the anon hash <br>
constructor when you meant to use parens. In any case, a
hash requires key/value pairs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%hash = { one =&gt; 1, two =&gt;
2, }; # WRONG <br>
%hash = [ qw/ an anon array / ]; # WRONG <br>
%hash = ( one =&gt; 1, two =&gt; 2, ); # right <br>
%hash = qw( one 1 two 2 ); # also fine</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Undefined value assigned to
typeglob <br>
(W) An undefined value was assigned to a typeglob, a la
&quot;*foo = undef&quot;. This does nothing. It&rsquo;s
possible that you really mean &quot;undef *foo&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use of reserved word
&quot;%s&quot; is deprecated <br>
(D) The indicated bareword is a reserved word. Future
versions of perl may use it as a keyword, so you&rsquo;re
better off either explicitly quoting the word in a manner
<br>
appropriate for its context of use, or using a different
name altogether. The warning can be suppressed for
subroutine names by either adding a &quot;&amp;&quot;
prefix, or using a <br>
package qualifier, e.g. &quot;&amp;our()&quot;, or
&quot;Foo::our()&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perl: warning: Setting locale
failed. <br>
(S) The whole warning message will look something like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perl: warning: Setting locale
failed. <br>
perl: warning: Please check that your locale settings: <br>
LC_ALL = &quot;En_US&quot;, <br>
LANG = (unset) <br>
are supported and installed on your system. <br>
perl: warning: Falling back to the standard locale
(&quot;C&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Exactly what were the failed
locale settings varies. In the above the settings were that
the LC_ALL was &quot;En_US&quot; and the LANG had no value.
This error means that Perl <br>
detected that you and/or your system administrator have set
up the so-called variable system but Perl could not use
those settings. This was not dead serious, fortunately: <br>
there is a &quot;default locale&quot; called &quot;C&quot;
that Perl can and will use, the script will be run. Before
you really fix the problem, however, you will get the same
error message <br>
each time you run Perl. How to really fix the problem can be
found in &quot;LOCALE PROBLEMS&quot; in perllocale.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Obsolete Diagnostics <br>
Can&rsquo;t mktemp() <br>
(F) The mktemp() routine failed for some reason while trying
to process a -e switch. Maybe your /tmp partition is full,
or clobbered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Removed because -e doesn&rsquo;t
use temporary files any more.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t write to temp file
for -e: %s <br>
(F) The write routine failed for some reason while trying to
process a -e switch. Maybe your /tmp partition is full, or
clobbered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Removed because -e doesn&rsquo;t
use temporary files any more.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cannot open temporary file <br>
(F) The create routine failed for some reason while trying
to process a -e switch. Maybe your /tmp partition is full,
or clobbered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Removed because -e doesn&rsquo;t
use temporary files any more.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">regexp too big <br>
(F) The current implementation of regular expressions uses
shorts as address offsets within a string. Unfortunately
this means that if the regular expression compiles to <br>
longer than 32767, it&rsquo;ll blow up. Usually when you
want a regular expression this big, there is a better way to
do it with multiple statements. See perlre.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Configuration Changes <br>
You can use &quot;Configure -Uinstallusrbinperl&quot; which
causes installperl to skip installing perl also as
/usr/bin/perl. This is useful if you prefer not to modify
/usr/bin for some <br>
reason or another but harmful because many scripts assume to
find Perl in /usr/bin/perl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the
headers of recently posted articles in the
comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup. There may also be information
at <br>
http://www.perl.com/perl/ , the Perl Home Page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you believe you have an
unreported bug, please run the perlbug program included with
your release. Make sure you trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case. Your <br>
