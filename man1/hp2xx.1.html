<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
hp2xx reads HPGL ASCII source files, interprets them, and
converts them into either another vector-oriented format or
one of several rasterfile formats. Currently, its HPGL <br>
parser recognizes a large subset of HPGL/2. Some high-level
functions related to polygon filling are missing. Also, only
some of the fixed space vector fonts and none of the <br>
variable space arc fonts are supported. Beside these
limitations, hp2xx has proven to work with many HP-GL
sources without any trouble.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GENERAL OPTIONS <br>
hp2xx reads from stdin or from a file if any given on the
command line. If no output file name is given (default), the
output automatically goes into a file whose name is <br>
derived from the input file name and the current mode. For
example, hp2xx -m pcl foo.hpgl writes the output to a file
&quot;foo.pcl&quot;. Use option -f outfile to specify your
output file <br>
name explicitly, or -I -f- to write to stdout, e.g. when
piping into a queue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The program scans the current
HPGL source, converts all drawing commands into elementary
vectors, saves these in a temporary file, and concurrently
determines the maximum coordi&acirc; <br>
nate range used. It then processes the vectors by mapping
them into a user-defined coordinate system, preserving the
aspect ratio of the original data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This coordinate system by
default fits into a window of size 200 mm by 200 mm. To
change the size of this bounding window, use -h height and
-w width to set the (max.) desired <br>
height and width of your output picture; optionally use -a
aspectfactor to alter the aspect ratio by the given factor
(aspectfactor &lt; 1 narrows your picture). The generated
pic&acirc; <br>
ture will always fit into the window defined by -h height
and -w width, padded with background color at the lower or
right margin if needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A second way of defining sizes
is relying on the size the picture would actually show if
plotted on a sheet of paper by a HP-compatible plotter. By
activating flag -I -t (true <br>
size), options -a, -h, and -w are ignored, and the sizes are
derived from the HP-GL file assuming that 1 HP unit = 1/40
mm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Option -r rotation_angle (in
degrees) allows you to rotate the object prior to all
scaling operations. Its main use is to facilitate landscape
format: -r90 rotates your whole <br>
picture, e.g. from portait to landscape format. However, any
reasonable rotation angle is valid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By naming a file with option -l
log_file you can redirect the diagnostic outputs into the
given file, even without a redirection mechanism for stderr
like in UNIX shells (e. g., <br>
DOS). Option -q (quiet) gets rid of them completely.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you need to process a series
of similar objects which should be translated into exactly
the same coordinate system, there is a way to override the
auto-scaling: First, run all <br>
files separately and note the infos on the used coordinate
ranges. Then, pick a range that will cover ALL your
pictures. You can now assign defaults to the internally
generated <br>
range limits by specifying -x xmin, -X xmax, -y ymin, and -Y
ymax. NOTE: Clipping is only supported via the IW command !
If any picture coordinate exceeds your limits, they will
<br>
be overwritten.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use option -m mode to select the
program mode, i.e. the output format. Currently supported:
mode = &quot;mf&quot; (Metafont), &quot;em&quot; (emTeX
cial{} commands), &quot;epic&quot; (line drawing using <br>
TeX macros within epic.sty), &quot;eps&quot; (PostScript),
&quot;dxf&quot; (Autocad), &quot;emf/emp&quot; (MS Enhanced
Metafile / Printing - available in Windows-built executables
only), &quot;svg&quot; (Scalable Vec&acirc; <br>
tor Graphics), &quot;fig&quot; (XFig 3.2), &quot;gpt&quot;
(GnuPlot ascii), &quot;hpgl&quot; (simplified HP-GL, e.g.
for import tasks), &quot;pcl&quot; (HP-PCL Level 3 format
(suitable for printing on a HP Laserjet II, <br>
DeskJet, or compatible printer), &quot;escp2&quot; (Epson
Esc/P2 printer commands, suitable for printing on Epson
Stylus models), &quot;img&quot; (GEMs IMG format),
&quot;jpg&quot; (JPEG image), &quot;pdf&quot; (Adobe <br>
Portable Document format), &quot;pbm&quot; (Portable Bit Map
/ Portable PixMap for color plots), &quot;pcx&quot;
(PC-Paintbrush format, also accepted by MS-Paintbrush /
Windows 3.0 and many other PC <br>
based pixel renderers), &quot;png&quot; (Portable Network
Graphics format), &quot;nc&quot; (CNC G-code, for
engravings), or &quot;rgip&quot; (Uniplex RGIP). There is
also a preview option &quot;pre&quot; which sup&acirc; <br>
ports VGA cards (DOS), ATARI, AMIGA, X11 servers, and
Sunview. Default mode is &quot;pre&quot;. (As some of these
modes rely on external libraries, they may not be builtin by
default, and <br>
not be available in prebuilt binaries supplied e.g. in Linux
distributions. The usage messsage generated when hp2xx is
invoked without parameters will always list exactly those
<br>
modes that are actually available.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you use a raster format, the
picture is rasterized by default into a 75 DPI resolution
image. Use option -d DPI_value to change the resolution,
e.g. -d300 will cause a HP LJ- <br>
II compatible 300 dpi rasterization. There is a way of
specifying a different resolution for y direction: -D
DPI_y_value</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some programs were found to
generate HPGL output with too tight clipping bounds, which
lead, for example, to some parts of text characters clipped
off. Use option -e extraclip <br>
to add some extra amount of space to clip areas to
workaround such mistakes. For example, -e 40 will add 40
extra plotter units to every side of clipping box which is 1
mm in <br>
true size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">While processing large pictures
at high resolution on low-memory machines, typically under
DOS, the program may start swapping. Optionally change the
swap file by using -s swap&acirc; <br>
file, e.g. to speed up processing by swapping to a RAM
disk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unless the hpgl file specifies
its own selection of pen widths and colors (for up to 256
pens), a carousel of 8 pens is simulated. You can specify
pen sizes and colors for each <br>
of these pens via options -p string and -c string.
&quot;string&quot; must consist of 1..8 digits (0-9 for
size, 0-7 for color). Digit number n (counting from left)
corresponds to pen <br>
number n. The digit value is this pen&rsquo;s color or size
in internal units. The pen width unit corresponds to 1/10 mm
- using pen widths beyond 0.9mm is possible by using the
let&acirc; <br>
ters of the latin alphabet, so that A=1mm, B=1.1mm etc. The
default size is 1 for all pens. Colors are assigned
according to: 0=off, 1=black, 2=red, 3=green, 4=blue,
5=cyan, <br>
6=magenta, 7=yellow. Examples of use: -p22222222 -c33333333
changes all pensizes to 2 units, all colors to green -p302
-c407 makes pen #1 a blue pen of size 3 , pen #3 a yellow
<br>
pen of size 2, suppresses all drawing with pen #2, and keeps
all other pen sizes and colors. Setting either -p or -c will
override the equivalent HPGL/2 commands (PC,PW) in the <br>
HP-GL file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sometimes, HP-GL files contain
several pages of plotter output. hp2xx recognizes the HP-GL
commands for &quot;feed-forward&quot;, &quot;pause&quot; or
&quot;new page&quot;, and by default draws each image as
<br>
a separate page (saving to sequentially numbered output
files, or opening a new preview window for each). You can
select any particular page range by using option -P
first&acirc; <br>
page:lastpage which causes hp2xx to skip all drawing
commands except those on the given pages. Please note that
even if only a single page is actually drawn, hp2xx will
nonethe&acirc; <br>
less process the whole HP-GL file. This makes sure that
effects of early pages on internal modes indeed influence
later pages, as on a real plotter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VECTOR FORMATS <br>
Supported vector formats are: TeX/Metafont, emTex-specials,
TeX/epic-Macros, Autocad DXF CNC G-code XFig 3.2, GnuPlot
ASCII, Simplified HP_GL, Uniplex RGIP Scalable Vector
Graph&acirc; <br>
ics (SVG) Adobe PDF(if libpdf is available) and -I
PostScript. Use -m mf to convert a HPGL drawing into a
Metafont character to be included into a TeX document as the
character <br>
&quot;Z&quot; of a special font that you may create. Edit
the metafont source, e.g., to change the letter
&quot;Z&quot; for another, or to change the line thickness,
which is set to 0.4pt by <br>
default. The other TeX-related modes (&quot;cad&quot; for
TeXcad compatible code, &quot;em&quot; for employing
cial{em:line} macros, and &quot;epic&quot; for drawing lines
with macros from &quot;epic.sty&quot;) <br>
address different compromises to cope with TeX&rsquo;s poor
line drawing capability and are generally not recommended
nor fully supported. Feel free to experiment with them --
they <br>
generate ASCII output that should be &quot;input&quot; into
TeX/LaTeX documents.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use option -p pensize(s) for
control over pensize: The actual Metafont or PostScript
pensize will be &quot;pensize * 0.1 mm&quot;, with pensize =
0 - 9 (0 = no drawing). The same applies <br>
to</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In PostScript mode (-m eps), you
may also need to use options -o and -O (see below) for
proper margins on paper since hp2xx puts your picture
&quot;flush&quot; to the left and upper paper <br>
limit by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RASTER FORMATS <br>
The following formats are supported: HP-PCL, Esc/P2, PCX,
PIC, IMG, JPG, PBM/PPM, PNG, TIFF, and previews. (PNG and
TIFF formats rely on external libpng,zlib and libtiff, JPG
<br>
relies on libjpeg. Versions built on MS windows systems - or
versions linked against libEMF on other platforms - may
additionally support EMF generation and printing.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Addition of other formats is
made easy for programmers because of hp2xx&rsquo;s modular
structure. The program allocates a bitmap on a line-by-line
basis, swapping lines to disk if <br>
needed, and plots into this bitmap. Depending on the
selected format, a conversion module is then activated,
which can easily be replaced by other converters. Add more
formats if <br>
you like!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Option -p pensize(s) controls
the size (in pixels) of the virtual plotting pen. The only
implemented shape of the pen tip is a square of the given
length. pen sizes of 5...9 <br>
units will be acccepted but replaced by 4 units. Specifying
-p4 when in 75 DPI mode will make pretty clumsy pictures,
while you may prefer -p2 over -p1 when in 300 DPI.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PCX: The size of a PCX picture
is controlled via its specified height and the current DPI
value. To create a high-resolution PCX image, just increase
the DPI value as desired. <br>
PCX format does not accept offsets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IMG: See PCX.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PBM/PPM: See PCX for options. If
your hpgl file is not monochrome, hp2xx will automatically
create a PPM (portable pixmap) file instead of a PBM bitmap.
(Use -c11111111 to force <br>
generation of PBM from a color hpgl file). Depending on the
compile-time option PBM_ASCII, hp2xx will create ascii or
binary pbm (ppm) files - usually the more efficient binary
<br>
format should be preferred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(Unsupported options) PIC, PAC:
ATARI ST screens (640x400 pixels) can easily be dumped to
files. Programs such as STAD accept graphics by including
such screen dump files. <br>
Graphics filling more than one screenful may be split into
screen-size blocks and loaded/mounted blockwise. hp2xx
converts to ATARI bitmap format by trying to fit the
resulting <br>
picture into a single screen equivalent (max. 400 rows, max.
80 Bytes (640 pixel) per row). If it succeeds, hp2xx
produces a single output file. Specify ONLY its base name
<br>
(option -f), since hp2xx adds the file extension
&quot;.pic&quot; or &quot;.pac&quot; automatically. Do NOT
try to work on more than one HPGL file simultaneously! Do
NOT use more than 6 characters <br>
for the file name, and avoid digits. If more screen blocks
are required horizontally and/or vertically, hp2xx will
automatically split the picture into separate files,
counting <br>
them columnwise (top-to-bottom and left-to-right), adding a
two-digit number to the given file name. A maximum of 10
columns is supported. The picture is padded with background
<br>
color at its right and lower margins, if needed. PAC
features file compression, PIC does not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PCL: HP-PCL Level 3 format, most
useful for direct printer output. Due to this action, there
have been added some extra flags and options: Use flag -i to
send a printer initial&acirc; <br>
ization sequence before the actual image. Among other
things, this will instruct the printer which paper size to
use. Flag -F adds a Form Feed (FF, hex 0C) after the image
is <br>
completed, which is what you may want most of the time.
However, overlay printing of several files is feasible by
omitting -F.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For additional control of the
picture&rsquo;s final position on paper, you may add x or y
offsets using -o X_offset or -O Y_offset. E.g., -o 20 -O 30
will give you 30 mm additional top <br>
margin and 20 mm additional left margin. Option -C modifies
these offsets to center the picture within the frame defined
by -w -h.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The option -C will attempt to
center the drawing on the paper automatically. Note also
that hp2xx now honors any PS (page size) commands in the
hpgl file, which can also create <br>
white space around the actual drawing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The option -N will make hp2xx
ignore any PS commands given in the hpgl file, and
recalculate the image size based on the actual geometry
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The option -n will make hp2xx
ignore any polygon filling commands, rendering only their
outlines. This may serve both as a work-around for
hp2xx&rsquo; limited polyfill support, and <br>
improve clarity of thumbnail images of PCB designs and the
like.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The option -M pennumber will
remap any color or drawing commands from pen 0 to the
specified pen (which should typically be otherwise unused in
the drawing). Historically, <br>
selecting pen 0 instructed a pen plotter to put away the pen
and stop drawing, while modern inkjet plotters can use it
like any other color. Due to this ambiguity, hp2xx will <br>
draw the background of raster graphics in the pen 0 color,
unless this option is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For DeskJet / DeskJet Plus /
DeskJet 500 / Deskjet 550 printers, there are some special
printer commands. Activate them with option -S n. n=0
switches them off, n=1 activates <br>
black/white mode, n=3 (DJ500C and DJ550 only) supports CMY
color data, n=4 (DJ550C only) supports CMYK color data. Any
n!=0 activates PLC data compression (TIFF mode: 2).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Esc/P2: This is the control
language used in the Epson Stylus family of inkjets. hp2xx
currently does not address more than one line of nozzles in
the print head, so printing, <br>
while exact, is extremely slow. Users might prefer piping
the output of the PostScript module through ghostscript
until this issue is resolved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PNG: Support for the Portable
Network Graphics format relies on libpng which is available
from www.libpng.org.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PRE: Preview on all machines.
Use options -h -w -o -O -C to define the screen size and
position of your output (-o -O -C may not always apply).
Under X11, you can pan around an <br>
image that is larger than the screen size by
&rsquo;dragging&rsquo; it with the mouse (pressing button 1
while moving the mouse in the desired direction). Any other
mouse button or keyboard <br>
key will terminate the preview. For VGA cards (DOS), option
-V VGAmode gives you a simple way to utilize SVGA modes.
Please take care not to define larger windows than your <br>
graphics device can handle, as the results are
unpredictable. As hp2xx uses standard BIOS calls to set
pixels on VGA cards (slow but portable), you can select any
hi-res mode <br>
supported by your system by simply specifying the mode byte
with this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TIFF: The tagged image file
format is supported by most graphics and image manipulation
programs. Support for TIFF in hp2xx relies on the TIFF
library available from <br>
www.libtiff.org, which offers several means of image
compression. The -S commandline option selects between them
as follows: -S 0 or -S 1: no compression -S 2: RLE (run
length <br>
encoding) -S 3: Group 3 FAX (monochrome) -S 4: Group 4 FAX
(monochrome) -S 5: GIF (not available by default, because of
the UNISYS patent) -S 6: JPEG (&rsquo;old&rsquo; TIFF 6.0
style) -S 7: <br>
JPEG -S 8: deflate</p>
