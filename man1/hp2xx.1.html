<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<i>hp2xx</i> reads HPGL ASCII source files, interprets them, and converts them
  into either another vector-oriented format or one of several rasterfile
  formats. Currently, its HPGL parser recognizes a large subset of HPGL/2. Some
  high-level functions related to polygon filling are missing. Also, only some
  of the fixed space vector fonts and none of the variable space arc fonts are
  supported. Beside these limitations, <i>hp2xx</i> has proven to work with many
  HP-GL sources without any trouble.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="GENERAL_OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#GENERAL_OPTIONS">GENERAL
  OPTIONS</a></h1>
<i>hp2xx</i> reads from stdin or from a file if any given on the command line.
  If no output file name is given (default), the output automatically goes into
  a file whose name is derived from the input file name and the current mode.
  For example, <i>hp2xx -m pcl foo.hpgl</i> writes the output to a file
  &quot;foo.pcl&quot;. Use option <i>-f outfile</i> to specify your output file
  name explicitly, or -I -f- to write to stdout, e.g. when piping into a queue.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The program scans the current HPGL source, converts all drawing commands into
  elementary vectors, saves these in a temporary file, and concurrently
  determines the maximum coordinate range used. It then processes the vectors by
  mapping them into a user-defined coordinate system, preserving the aspect
  ratio of the original data.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This coordinate system by default fits into a window of size 200 mm by 200 mm.
  To change the size of this bounding window, use <i>-h height</i> and <i>-w
  width</i> to set the (max.) desired height and width of your output picture;
  optionally use <i>-a aspectfactor</i> to alter the aspect ratio by the given
  factor (aspectfactor &lt; 1 narrows your picture). The generated picture will
  always fit into the window defined by -h height and -w width, padded with
  background color at the lower or right margin if needed.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
A second way of defining sizes is relying on the size the picture would actually
  show if plotted on a sheet of paper by a HP-compatible plotter. By activating
  flag -I -t (true size), options -a, -h, and -w are ignored, and the sizes are
  derived from the HP-GL file assuming that 1 HP unit = 1/40 mm.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Option <i>-r rotation_angle (in degrees)</i> allows you to rotate the object
  prior to all scaling operations. Its main use is to facilitate landscape
  format: -r90 rotates your whole picture, e.g. from portait to landscape
  format. However, any reasonable rotation angle is valid.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
By naming a file with option <i>-l log_file</i> you can redirect the diagnostic
  outputs into the given file, even without a redirection mechanism for stderr
  like in UNIX shells (e. g., DOS). Option <i>-q</i> (quiet) gets rid of them
  completely.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If you need to process a series of similar objects which should be translated
  into exactly the same coordinate system, there is a way to override the
  auto-scaling: First, run all files separately and note the infos on the used
  coordinate ranges. Then, pick a range that will cover ALL your pictures. You
  can now assign defaults to the internally generated range limits by specifying
  <i>-x xmin,</i> <i>-X xmax,</i> <i>-y ymin,</i> and <i>-Y ymax.</i> NOTE:
  Clipping is only supported via the IW command ! If any picture coordinate
  exceeds your limits, they will be overwritten.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Use option <i>-m mode</i> to select the program mode, i.e. the output format.
  Currently supported: mode = &quot;mf&quot; (Metafont), &quot;em&quot; (emTeX
  \special{} commands), &quot;epic&quot; (line drawing using TeX macros within
  epic.sty), &quot;eps&quot; (PostScript), &quot;dxf&quot; (Autocad),
  &quot;emf/emp&quot; (MS Enhanced Metafile / Printing - available in
  Windows-built executables only), &quot;svg&quot; (Scalable Vector Graphics),
  &quot;fig&quot; (XFig 3.2), &quot;gpt&quot; (GnuPlot ascii), &quot;hpgl&quot;
  (simplified HP-GL, e.g. for import tasks), &quot;pcl&quot; (HP-PCL Level 3
  format (suitable for printing on a HP Laserjet II, DeskJet, or compatible
  printer), &quot;escp2&quot; (Epson Esc/P2 printer commands, suitable for
  printing on Epson Stylus models), &quot;img&quot; (GEMs IMG format),
  &quot;jpg&quot; (JPEG image), &quot;pdf&quot; (Adobe Portable Document
  format), &quot;pbm&quot; (Portable Bit Map / Portable PixMap for color plots),
  &quot;pcx&quot; (PC-Paintbrush format, also accepted by MS-Paintbrush /
  Windows 3.0 and many other PC based pixel renderers), &quot;png&quot;
  (Portable Network Graphics format), &quot;nc&quot; (CNC G-code, for
  engravings), or &quot;rgip&quot; (Uniplex RGIP). There is also a preview
  option &quot;pre&quot; which supports VGA cards (DOS), ATARI, AMIGA, X11
  servers, and Sunview. Default mode is &quot;pre&quot;. (As some of these modes
  rely on external libraries, they may not be builtin by default, and not be
  available in prebuilt binaries supplied e.g. in Linux distributions. The usage
  messsage generated when hp2xx is invoked without parameters will always list
  exactly those modes that are actually available.)
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If you use a raster format, the picture is rasterized by default into a 75 DPI
  resolution image. Use option <i>-d DPI_value</i> to change the resolution,
  e.g. -d300 will cause a HP LJ-II compatible 300 dpi rasterization. There is a
  way of specifying a different resolution for y direction: <i>-D
  DPI_y_value</i>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Some programs were found to generate HPGL output with too tight clipping bounds,
  which lead, for example, to some parts of text characters clipped off. Use
  option <i>-e extraclip</i> to add some extra amount of space to clip areas to
  workaround such mistakes. For example, -e 40 will add 40 extra plotter units
  to every side of clipping box which is 1 mm in true size.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
While processing large pictures at high resolution on low-memory machines,
  typically under DOS, the program may start swapping. Optionally change the
  swap file by using <i>-s swapfile,</i> e.g. to speed up processing by swapping
  to a RAM disk.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Unless the hpgl file specifies its own selection of pen widths and colors (for
  up to 256 pens), a carousel of 8 pens is simulated. You can specify pen sizes
  and colors for each of these pens via options <i>-p string</i> and <i>-c
  string.</i> &quot;string&quot; must consist of 1..8 digits (0-9 for size, 0-7
  for color). Digit number n (counting from left) corresponds to pen number n.
  The digit value is this pen's color or size in internal units. The pen width
  unit corresponds to 1/10 mm - using pen widths beyond 0.9mm is possible by
  using the letters of the latin alphabet, so that A=1mm, B=1.1mm etc. The
  default size is 1 for all pens. Colors are assigned according to: 0=off,
  1=black, 2=red, 3=green, 4=blue, 5=cyan, 6=magenta, 7=yellow. Examples of use:
  <i>-p22222222 -c33333333</i> changes all pensizes to 2 units, all colors to
  green <i>-p302 -c407</i> makes pen #1 a blue pen of size 3 , pen #3 a yellow
  pen of size 2, suppresses all drawing with pen #2, and keeps all other pen
  sizes and colors. Setting either -p or -c will override the equivalent HPGL/2
  commands (PC,PW) in the HP-GL file.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Sometimes, HP-GL files contain several pages of plotter output. <i>hp2xx</i>
  recognizes the HP-GL commands for &quot;feed-forward&quot;, &quot;pause&quot;
  or &quot;new page&quot;, and by default draws each image as a separate page
  (saving to sequentially numbered output files, or opening a new preview window
  for each). You can select any particular page range by using option <i>-P
  firstpage:lastpage</i> which causes <i>hp2xx</i> to skip all drawing commands
  except those on the given pages. Please note that even if only a single page
  is actually drawn, <i>hp2xx</i> will nonetheless process the whole HP-GL file.
  This makes sure that effects of early pages on internal modes indeed influence
  later pages, as on a real plotter.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="VECTOR_FORMATS"><a class="selflink" href="#VECTOR_FORMATS">VECTOR
  FORMATS</a></h1>
Supported vector formats are: <i>TeX/Metafont,</i> <i>emTex-specials,</i>
  <i>TeX/epic-Macros,</i> <i>Autocad DXF</i> <i>CNC G-code</i> <i>XFig 3.2,</i>
  <i>GnuPlot ASCII,</i> <i>Simplified HP_GL,</i> <i>Uniplex RGIP</i> <i>Scalable
  Vector Graphics (SVG)</i> <i>Adobe PDF(if libpdf is available)</i> and -I
  PostScript. Use <i>-m mf</i> to convert a HPGL drawing into a Metafont
  character to be included into a TeX document as the character &quot;Z&quot; of
  a special font that you may create. Edit the metafont source, e.g., to change
  the letter &quot;Z&quot; for another, or to change the line thickness, which
  is set to 0.4pt by default. The other TeX-related modes (&quot;cad&quot; for
  TeXcad compatible code, &quot;em&quot; for employing \special{em:line} macros,
  and &quot;epic&quot; for drawing lines with macros from &quot;epic.sty&quot;)
  address different compromises to cope with TeX's poor line drawing capability
  and are generally not recommended nor fully supported. Feel free to experiment
  with them -- they generate ASCII output that should be &quot;input&quot; into
  TeX/LaTeX documents.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Use option <i>-p pensize(s)</i> for control over pensize: The actual Metafont or
  PostScript pensize will be &quot;pensize * 0.1 mm&quot;, with pensize = 0 - 9
  (0 = no drawing). The same applies to
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
In PostScript mode <i>(-m eps),</i> you may also need to use options -o and -O
  (see below) for proper margins on paper since <i>hp2xx</i> puts your picture
  &quot;flush&quot; to the left and upper paper limit by default.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="RASTER_FORMATS"><a class="selflink" href="#RASTER_FORMATS">RASTER
  FORMATS</a></h1>
The following formats are supported: HP-PCL, Esc/P2, PCX, PIC, IMG, JPG,
  PBM/PPM, PNG, TIFF, and previews. (PNG and TIFF formats rely on external
  libpng,zlib and libtiff, JPG relies on libjpeg. Versions built on MS windows
  systems - or versions linked against libEMF on other platforms - may
  additionally support EMF generation and printing.)
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Addition of other formats is made easy for programmers because of <i>hp2xx's</i>
  modular structure. The program allocates a bitmap on a line-by-line basis,
  swapping lines to disk if needed, and plots into this bitmap. Depending on the
  selected format, a conversion module is then activated, which can easily be
  replaced by other converters. Add more formats if you like!
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Option <i>-p pensize(s)</i> controls the size (in pixels) of the virtual
  plotting pen. The only implemented shape of the pen tip is a square of the
  given length. pen sizes of 5...9 units will be acccepted but replaced by 4
  units. Specifying -p4 when in 75 DPI mode will make pretty clumsy pictures,
  while you may prefer -p2 over -p1 when in 300 DPI.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
PCX: The size of a PCX picture is controlled via its specified height and the
  current DPI value. To create a high-resolution PCX image, just increase the
  DPI value as desired. PCX format does not accept offsets.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
IMG: See PCX.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
PBM/PPM: See PCX for options. If your hpgl file is not monochrome, hp2xx will
  automatically create a PPM (portable pixmap) file instead of a PBM bitmap.
  (Use -c11111111 to force generation of PBM from a color hpgl file). Depending
  on the compile-time option PBM_ASCII, hp2xx will create ascii or binary pbm
  (ppm) files - usually the more efficient binary format should be preferred.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
(Unsupported options) PIC, PAC: ATARI ST screens (640x400 pixels) can easily be
  dumped to files. Programs such as STAD accept graphics by including such
  screen dump files. Graphics filling more than one screenful may be split into
  screen-size blocks and loaded/mounted blockwise. <i>hp2xx</i> converts to
  ATARI bitmap format by trying to fit the resulting picture into a single
  screen equivalent (max. 400 rows, max. 80 Bytes (640 pixel) per row). If it
  succeeds, <i>hp2xx</i> produces a single output file. Specify ONLY its base
  name (option -f), since <i>hp2xx</i> adds the file extension &quot;.pic&quot;
  or &quot;.pac&quot; automatically. Do NOT try to work on more than one HPGL
  file simultaneously! Do NOT use more than 6 characters for the file name, and
  avoid digits. If more screen blocks are required horizontally and/or
  vertically, <i>hp2xx</i> will automatically split the picture into separate
  files, counting them columnwise (top-to-bottom and left-to-right), adding a
  two-digit number to the given file name. A maximum of 10 columns is supported.
  The picture is padded with background color at its right and lower margins, if
  needed. PAC features file compression, PIC does not.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
PCL: HP-PCL Level 3 format, most useful for direct printer output. Due to this
  action, there have been added some extra flags and options: Use flag <i>-i</i>
  to send a printer initialization sequence before the actual image. Among other
  things, this will instruct the printer which paper size to use. Flag <i>-F</i>
  adds a Form Feed (FF, hex 0C) after the image is completed, which is what you
  may want most of the time. However, overlay printing of several files is
  feasible by omitting -F.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
For additional control of the picture's final position on paper, you may add x
  or y offsets using <i>-o X_offset</i> or <i>-O Y_offset. E.g., -o 20 -O 30
  will give you 30 mm additional top margin</i> and 20 mm additional left
  margin. Option -C modifies these offsets to center the picture within the
  frame defined by -w -h.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The option <i>-C</i> will attempt to center the drawing on the paper
  automatically. Note also that <i>hp2xx</i> now honors any PS (page size)
  commands in the hpgl file, which can also create white space around the actual
  drawing.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The option <i>-N</i> will make hp2xx ignore any PS commands given in the hpgl
  file, and recalculate the image size based on the actual geometry instead.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The option <i>-n</i> will make hp2xx ignore any polygon filling commands,
  rendering only their outlines. This may serve both as a work-around for hp2xx'
  limited polyfill support, and improve clarity of thumbnail images of PCB
  designs and the like.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The option <i>-M pennumber</i> will remap any color or drawing commands from pen
  0 to the specified pen (which should typically be otherwise unused in the
  drawing). Historically, selecting pen 0 instructed a pen plotter to put away
  the pen and stop drawing, while modern inkjet plotters can use it like any
  other color. Due to this ambiguity, hp2xx will draw the background of raster
  graphics in the pen 0 color, unless this option is used.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
For DeskJet / DeskJet Plus / DeskJet 500 / Deskjet 550 printers, there are some
  special printer commands. Activate them with option <i>-S n.</i> n=0 switches
  them off, n=1 activates black/white mode, n=3 (DJ500C and DJ550 only) supports
  CMY color data, n=4 (DJ550C only) supports CMYK color data. Any n!=0 activates
  PLC data compression (TIFF mode: 2).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Esc/P2: This is the control language used in the Epson Stylus family of inkjets.
  <i>hp2xx</i> currently does not address more than one line of nozzles in the
  print head, so printing, while exact, is extremely slow. Users might prefer
  piping the output of the PostScript module through <i>ghostscript</i> until
  this issue is resolved.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
PNG: Support for the Portable Network Graphics format relies on <i>libpng</i>
  which is available from www.libpng.org.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
PRE: Preview on all machines. Use options -h -w -o -O -C to define the screen
  size and position of your output (-o -O -C may not always apply). Under X11,
  you can pan around an image that is larger than the screen size by 'dragging'
  it with the mouse (pressing button 1 while moving the mouse in the desired
  direction). Any other mouse button or keyboard key will terminate the preview.
  For VGA cards (DOS), option <i>-V VGAmode</i> gives you a simple way to
  utilize SVGA modes. Please take care not to define larger windows than your
  graphics device can handle, as the results are unpredictable. As hp2xx uses
  standard BIOS calls to set pixels on VGA cards (slow but portable), you can
  select any hi-res mode supported by your system by simply specifying the mode
  byte with this option.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
TIFF: The tagged image file format is supported by most graphics and image
  manipulation programs. Support for TIFF in <i>hp2xx</i> relies on the <i>TIFF
  library</i> available from www.libtiff.org, which offers several means of
  image compression. The <i>-S</i> commandline option selects between them as
  follows: <i>-S 0 or -S 1: no compression</i> <i>-S 2: RLE (run length
  encoding)</i> <i>-S 3: Group 3 FAX (monochrome)</i> <i>-S 4: Group 4 FAX
  (monochrome)</i> <i>-S 5: GIF (not available by default, because of the UNISYS
  patent)</i> <i>-S 6: JPEG ('old' TIFF 6.0 style)</i> <i>-S 7: JPEG</i> <i>-S
  8: deflate</i>
