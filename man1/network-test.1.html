<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
network-test - check the network and test if everything is
fine</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
network-test</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The network-test program will test your system&rsquo;s
network configuration using basic tests and providing both
information (INFO), warnings (WARN) and possible errors
(ERR) based on <br>
the results of these tests. It will check and report on:
<br>
* Status of the network interfaces of the system including:
link status, <br>
IP addressing and number of transmitted packets and error
rates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Accessibility to configured
routes to external networks, <br>
including the default network route, checking the routers
configured <br>
to give access to the network</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Proper host resolution,
testing DNS resolution against a known host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Proper network connectivity,
testing reachability of remote hosts using ICMP and
simulating a web connections to a remote web server (the web
server used for the tests <br>
can be configured through the environment, see below)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The program does not need
special privileges to run as it does not do any system
change.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, the behaviour of the
program when running as an unprivileged user is not the same
as running as system administrator (i.e. root). If the
program is run as system admin&acirc; <br>
istrator it will try to run some tools that are only
available to it to speed up some of the tests.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The program relies on the use of
ip, netstat, ifconfig, arp and (when running as root)
ethtool or mii-tool, to obtain information about the
system&rsquo;s networking configuration <br>
(status of available interfaces and configured network
routes). It also uses ping, host and nc (netcat) to do tests
of the network connectivity and ensure that the host can
con&acirc; <br>
nect to the Internet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
The program will, by default, check www.debian.org and its
associated web server. If you want to use a different check
host you can setup the environment as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CHECK_HOST <br>
The name of a host to use when testing DNS resolution. By
default &rsquo;www.debian.org&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CHECK_IP_ADRESS <br>
The CHECK_HOST &Acirc;&acute;s IP address. By default
defined with the following value: 194.109.137.218</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CHECK_WEB_HOST <br>
The web server to use for testing purposes when testing
network connectivity. By default it will use
&rsquo;www.debian.org&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CHECK_WEB_PORT <br>
The web server port of server CHECK_WEB_HOST that will be
used for testing. By default it will use TCP port 80..</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CHECK_WEB_URL <br>
A web service to test network connectivity by downloading
some content. By default it will use
&rsquo;http://network-test.debian.org/moo&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CHECK_WEB_MD5 <br>
The MD5sum value of the content being checked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CHECK_IP_URL <br>
A web service used to determine the system&rsquo;s public IP
address. By default it will use
&rsquo;http://queryip.net/ip/&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The program will exit with error (1) if any of the network
checks fail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
This program does not have super cow powers so it is unable
to fix the errors by itself. It is also unable to detect if
the network is failing due to a local firewall policy been
<br>
in place so make sure you check your system logs with dmesg
(1) to detect if some of the active tests are being dropped
due to your local firewall.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other known issues that might
make the program not work reliable are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* IPv6: The program does not yet
explicitly handle IPv6 only hosts, some of the tests might
be biased towards IPv4 and might fail in IPv6
environments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Proxies: The program does not
check network connectivity for hosts that connect through
the Internet using a proxy gateway for services. The program
might report issues <br>
in hosts using proxies even when these might connect to the
Internet properly through proxied services.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Firewall environments: some of
the tests rely on direct connectivity to external hosts,
which are tested using ICMP queries (through the use of
ping. These tests might <br>
fail in hosts installed in networking environments with
firewalls that block outbound ICMP communication.</p>
