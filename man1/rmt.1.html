<p>RMT(1) Schily&Acirc;&acute;s USER COMMANDS RMT(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
rmt - remote magnetic tape protocol server</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
/opt/schily/sbin/rmt <br>
/etc/rmt</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This is the description of the enhanced Schily version of
the rmt remote tape server program. rmt is a program used by
programs like star and ufsdump that like to access remote
<br>
magnetic tape drives and files through an interprocess
communication connection. rmt is normally started up with an
rexec(3) or rcmd(3) call.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The rmt program accepts open,
close, read, write and seek requests as well as requests
that are specific to magnetic tapes. rmt performs the
commands and then responds with a <br>
status indication.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This version of the rmt server
gives full compatibility to the original BSD version, the
enhanced Sun version and the enhanced GNU version. In
addition to the Sun and GNU <br>
enhancements, it implements further abstractions for better
cross platform compliance. It supports best speed and best
compliance even when server and client code are running on
<br>
different platforms. It is prepared to be installed as a
user shell in the passwd file to create remote tape specific
logins and security checking. To use the enhanced
compati&acirc; <br>
bility features, you need to either use the remote tape
client code from star which is available in librmt or
reimplement its features.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All responses are send back in
ASCII. They are in one of the following two forms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Successful commands have
responses of</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Anumber</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where number is the ASCII
representation of a decimal number that usually is the
return code of the corresponding system call. Unsuccessful
commands are responded to with</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Eerror-number0rror-message</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where error-number is one of the
possible error numbers described in intro(2), and
error-message is the corresponding error string as retrieved
by strerror(3). Note that the <br>
error number is valid on the remote system where the rmt
code runs and may have a different meaning on the local
system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The protocol implements the
following commands:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Odevice0ode</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Odevice0ode symbolic_mode <br>
Open the specified device or file using the indicated mode.
device is a full path name, and mode is an ASCII
representation of a decimal number suitable <br>
for being passed as second parameter to open(2). A variant
of the open command includes the symbolic_mode string which
is a GNU extension. If both, mode <br>
and symbolic_mode are present, they are separated by a space
character; symbolic_mode appears on the same line as the
numeric mode. It is send using the <br>
same notation as used in a C source (e.g. O_RDWR|O_CREAT).
If the symbolic_mode is send to the server, the numeric mode
is ignored. The symbolic notation <br>
allows to send the expected open mode over the wire, using a
system independent method. This is needed because different
operating systems usually define <br>
all bits in a different way. An exception are the lowest two
bits. The lowest two bits allow to code O_RDONLY,O_WRONLY
and O_RDWR. To prevent unexpected <br>
behavior, rmt masks the numeric open mode with 0x03 before
using it as argument to the open(2) call. If you need more
bits in the second parameter ot <br>
open(2), you need to use the symbolic mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no file /etc/default/rmt
exists, only filenames starting with /dev/ are accepted for
security reasons.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a device is already open, it
is closed before a new open is performed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A RMT protocol VERSION 1 client
should issue a <br>
I-10 <br>
command just after opening a file or device. This is needed
to tell the server that the client is aware of the official
order of the mt_op codes in the <br>
range 0..7 and that is maps deviating values to the official
ones.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cdevice Close the currently open
device or file. The argument device is ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Rcount Read count bytes of data
from the open device or file. rmt performs the requested
read(2) operation and responds with Acount-readif the read
operation <br>
was successful; otherwise an error in standard format is
returned. If the read operation was successful, the data
read is sent directly after the response <br>
described above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Wcount Write data to the open
device or file. After reading the command specification, rmt
reads count bytes from the network connection and aborts if
a premature <br>
EOF is encountered. The return value from the write(2)
operation is returned as reply.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Lwhence0ffset <br>
Perform an lseek(2) operation on the open device or file
using the specified parameters. The return value from the
lseek(2) operation is returned as reply.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On large file aware operating
systems, rmt will correctly handle large lseek(2)
requests.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following whence values are
supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 Mapped to SEEK_SET.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 Mapped to SEEK_CUR.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 Mapped to SEEK_END.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3 Mapped to SEEK_DATA If
avalable on the remote system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4 Mapped to SEEK_HOLE If
avalable on the remote system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">S The old non-portable status
call. This call should not be used anymore, it has been
replaced by the new RMT protocol version 1 extended status
call below. <br>
If the currently open device is a magnetic tape, return the
magnetic tape status, as obtained with a MTIOCGET ioctl
call. If the open device is not a mag&acirc; <br>
netic tape, an error is returned. If the MTIOCGET operation
was successful, an &acirc;ack&acirc; is sent with the size
of the status buffer, then the status buffer is <br>
sent. As the status buffer is sent in binary, this command
it considered outdated. Please use the extended status
command instead. This command is not <br>
terminated by a new-line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ssub-command The new portable
status call. This command is part of the RMT protocol
version 1. If the currently open device is a magnetic tape,
return a single speci&acirc; <br>
fied member of the magnetic tape status structure, as
obtained with a MTIOCGET ioctl call. If the open device is
not a magnetic tape, an error is returned. <br>
If the MTIOCGET operation was successful, the numerical
value of the structure member is returned in decimal. The
following sub commands are supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">T return the content of the
structure member mt_type which contains the type of the
magnetic tape device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">D return the content of the
structure member mt_dsreg which contains the &acirc;drive
status register&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">E return the content of the
structure member mt_erreg which contains the &acirc;error
register&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This structure member must be
retrieved first because it is cleared after each MTIOCGET
ioctl call. The librmt will always retrieve the member <br>
mt_erreg first when it is told to retrieve a complete status
structure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">R return the content of the
structure member mt_resid which contains the residual count
of the last I/O.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">F return the content of the
structure member mt_fileno which contains the block number
of the current tape position.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">B return the content of the
structure member mt_blkno which contains the block number of
the current tape position.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f return the content of the
structure member mt_flags which contains MTF_ flags from the
driver.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">b return the content of the
structure member mt_bf which contains the optimum blocking
factor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command is not terminated
with a new-line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ioperation0ount <br>
Perform a MTIOCOP ioctl(2) command using the specified
parameters. The parameters are interpreted as the ASCII
representations of the decimal values to <br>
place in the mt_op and mt_count fields of the structure used
in the ioctl call. When the operation is successful the
return value is the count parameter. <br>
Only Opcodes 0..7 are unique across different architectures.
In many cases Linux does not even follow this rule. If we
know that we have been called by a <br>
RMT protocol VERSION 1 client, we may safely assume that the
client is not using Linux mapping over the wire but the
standard mapping described below:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-1 Retrieve the version number
of the rmt server and tell the server that the client is
aware of the official order of the MTIOCOP ioctl(2) opcodes
in <br>
the range 0..7. Local mt_op codes must be remapped to the
official values before sending them over the wire.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The answer of the current
version of rmt is 1. Old rmt implementations send an error
code back when this command is used. Future rmt
implementa&acirc; <br>
tions with further enhancements will send an answer with a
value &gt; 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 Issue a MTWEOF command (write
count end-of-file records).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 Issue a MTFSF command (forward
space over count file marks).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 Issue a MTBSF command
(backward space over count file marks).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3 Issue a MTFSR command (forward
space count inter-record gaps).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4 Issue a MTBSR command
(backward space count inter-record gaps).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5 Issue a MTREW command
(rewind).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6 Issue a MTOFFL command (rewind
and put the drive off-line).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">7 Issue a MTNOP command (no
operation, set status only).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ioperation0ount <br>
Perform a MTIOCOP ioctl(2) command using the specified
parameters. This command is a RMT protocol VERSION 1
extension and implements support for commands <br>
beyond MTWEOF..MTNOP (0..7). The parameters are interpreted
as the ASCII representations of the decimal values described
below. They are converted into <br>
the local values mt_op and mt_count fields of the structure
used in the ioctl call according to the actual values found
in &lt;sys/mtio.h&gt;. When the operation <br>
is successful the return value is the count parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 Issue a MTCACHE command
(switch cache on).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 Issue a MTNOCACHE command
(switch cache off).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 Issue a MTRETEN command
(retension the tape).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3 Issue a MTERASE command (erase
the entire tape).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4 Issue a MTEOM command
(position to end of media).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5 Issue a MTNBSF command
(backward space count files to BOF).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">v Return the version of the rmt
server. This is currently the decimal number 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any other command causes rmt to
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/etc/default/rmt <br>
The file /etc/default/rmt allows to set up rules to limit
the accessibility of files based on rules. This feature is
typically used when the rmt run from a non personal <br>
but task specific login.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default values can be set for
the following options in /etc/default/rmt. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEBUG=/tmp/rmt.debug <br>
USER=tape <br>
ACCESS=tape myhost.mydomain.org /dev/rmt/*</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All keywords must be on the
beginning of a line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEBUG If you like to get debug
information, set this to a file name where rmt should put
debug information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USER The name of a user (local
to the magnetic tape server) that may use the services of
the rmt server. More than one USER=name line is possible. A
line USER=* grants <br>
access to all users.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ACCESS This keyword is followed
by three parameters separated by a TAB. The name of a user
(local to the magnetic tape server host) that may use the
services of the rmt <br>
server followed by the name of a host from where operation
is granted and a file specifier pattern for a file or file
sub tree that may be accessed if this ACCESS <br>
line matches. More than one ACCESS=name host path line is
possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If standard input of rmt is not
a socket from a remote host, rmt will compare the host entry
from /etc/default/rmt with the following strings:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PIPE If stdin is a UNIX
pipe.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you like to allow remote
connections that use the ssh protocol, you need to use the
word PIPE instead of the real hostname in the matching
ACCESS= <br>
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ILLEGAL_SOCKET <br>
If getpeername() does not work for stdin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOT_IP If getpeername() works
for stdin but is not connected to an internet socket.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
All responses are send to the network connection. They use
the form described above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
To use rmt as a remote file access protocol you need to use
the symbolic open modes as e.g. the O_CREAT flag is not
unique between different architectures.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to allow this
implementation to be used as a remote file access protocol,
it accepts file names up to 4096 bytes with the open
command. Other rmt implementations allow <br>
no more than 64 bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The possibility to create a
debug file by calling rmt file has been disabled for
security reasons. If you like to debug rmt edit
/etc/default/rmt and insert a DEBUG entry.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This implementation of rmt adds
some security features to the server that make it behave
slightly different from older implementations. Read the
above documentation about the <br>
file /etc/default/rmt to make sure your local installation
is configured for your needs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To grant the same permissions as
with old rmt servers, create a file /etc/default/rmt and add
the following lines to this file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USER=* <br>
ACCESS=* * *</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the three fields in
the ACCESS= line need to be separated by a TAB
character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Be very careful when designing
patterns to match path names that may be accepted for open.
If a pattern would allow to include /../ in the path, a
possible intruder could virtu&acirc; <br>
ally access any path on your system. For this reason, /../
is not allowed to appear in a path regardless of the
pattern.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
None known.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY <br>
The rmt command first appeared on BSD in march 1981. This
rmt server is a new implementation that tries to be
compatible to all existing implementations. It is the only
known <br>
implementation that in addition tries to fix the data
exchange problems between different architectures.</p>
