<p>EPIC(1) BSD General Commands Manual EPIC(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
epic &acirc; Internet Relay Chat client for UNIX like
systems</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
epic [-a] [-b] [-B] [-c chan] [-d] [-f] [-F] [-h] [-H
hostname] [-l filename] [-L filename] [-n nickname] [-o]
[-O] [-p port] [-q] [-v] [-x] [-z username] [nickname] <br>
[server description list]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The ircII/EPIC program is a unix-based character oriented
user agent (&rsquo;client&rsquo;) to Internet Relay Chat. It
is a fully functional ircII client with many useful
extensions. This <br>
version works with all modern irc server classes as of early
1999.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-a Append the server description list to the default server
list. The default behavior is for the server description
list to replace the default server list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b Operate in so called
&acirc;bot mode.&acirc; This implies the [-d] option. EPIC
will fork(2) immediately and the parent process will exit,
returning you to your shell. Some system <br>
administrators do not look kindly to their users running
bots, and they have disabled this option. Even if your
administrator has not disabled it, you should not assume
this <br>
gives you automatic permission to run a bot. If you do run a
bot without permission, your administrator may get very
angry with you, and possibly revoke your account. In <br>
addition, most IRC operators on public irc networks have
very little tolerance for people who run bots. So just a
word of caution, make sure that your system administrator
<br>
and your irc administrator have given you permission before
you run a bot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B Force the startup file to be
loaded immediately rather than waiting until a connection to
a server is established.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c chan <br>
Join the specified channel the first time you successfully
connect to a server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Operate in &acirc;dumb
mode.&acirc; The client will not put up a full screen
display, and will read from standard input and write to
standard output. This is useful if the output nor&acirc;
<br>
mally looks awful (because you are using an incorrect TERM
setting, or your terminal description is spectacularly
broken), or you just don&rsquo;t want to use the pretty
interface. <br>
This option will be turned on automatically if your current
TERM setting is not capable of a full screen display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Force use of hardware flow
control. With this option, the control-S and control-Q keys
are probably not available to be bound to something
else.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F Disable use of hardware flow
control. With this option, the control-S and control-Q keys
are available to be bound to something else. However, you
will not have hardware <br>
flow control.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Display a moderately concise
help message and exit immediately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H hostname <br>
Use the IP address of the specified hostname as your default
IP address. This can be used if you have multiple IP
addresses on the same machine and you want to use an <br>
address other than the default address. You might need to
use this option when gethostname(3) does not return a
hostname (in some poorly configured NIS environments). The
<br>
use of multiple IP addresses on a single machine is commonly
referred to as &quot;virtual hosting&quot;, and each IP
address is a &quot;virtual host&quot;. Please understand
that an irc client <br>
may not tell the irc server what your hostname should be:
the server alone determines that. Servers typically use the
canonical hostname for an IP address as your hostname. <br>
Because of this, this option will not permit you to use a
CNAME (secondary hostname for an IP address), because the
server will use the canonical hostname instead. This <br>
option overrides the IRCHOST environment variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l filename,[filename] <br>
Use the specified filename(s) as the startup file. The
startup file is loaded the first time you successfully
connect to a server, unless you specify the [-B] option.
This <br>
overrides the IRCRC environment variable. If this option is
not specified, and the IRCRC environment variable is not
set, then ~/.ircrc is the default startup file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n nickname <br>
Use the specified nickname as the default nickname whenever
you connect to an irc server. This option overrides the
IRCNICK environment variable. This option can be over&acirc;
<br>
ridden if you specify nickname argument in the command line
(see below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o Force use of IEXTEN termios
characters. POSIX systems are allowed to reserve additional
control characters to perform special actions when IEXTEN is
turned on. On 4.4BSD, <br>
the control-V and control-O keys are used by IEXTEN and thus
cannot be used in key bindings within EPIC since the
terminal never sends them to EPIC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O Disable use of IEXTEN termios
characters. This makes all of the keys reserved by your
system&rsquo;s IEXTEN termios option available to be used in
key bindings. On 4.4BSD, this <br>
flag is necessary if you want to use control-V and control-O
in your key bindings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p port <br>
Use the specified port as the default port for new server
connections. The default port is usually 6667. Make sure
that the servers you want to connect to are listening on
<br>
this port before you try to connect there.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Suppress the loading of any
file when you first establish a connection to an irc
server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Output version identification
(VID) information and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x This undocumented feature
turns on all of the XDEBUG flags. Refer to the help files
for XDEBUG if you want to know what happens if you use
this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z username <br>
Use the specified username when negotiating a connection to
a new irc server. This overrides the IRCUSER environment
variable. If this option is not specified, then the <br>
user name specified in /etc/passwd for your user is used.
This feature was formerly undocumented, but with the rise
and popularity and use of identd(8) this option is much <br>
less useful than it once was. Requests to have this option
removed will probably be ignored. If you don&rsquo;t want
your users to spoof their usernames, install identd, and do
<br>
everyone on IRC a favor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nickname <br>
The first bare word found is taken as the default nickname
to use. This overrides all other options, including the -n
option and the IRCNICK environment variable. If all <br>
else fails, then the client uses your login name as the
default nickname.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">server,[server] <br>
After the nickname, a list of one or more server
specifications can be listed. Unless you specify the -a
option, this will replace your default server list! The -a
option <br>
forces any servers listed here to be appended to the default
server list. The format for server specifications is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hostname:port:password:nick</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any item can be omitted by
leaving the field blank, and any trailing colons can also be
omitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DETAILED DESCRIPTION <br>
The Screen: <br>
The screen is split into two parts, separated by an
inverse-video status line (if supported). The upper (larger)
part of the screen displays responses from the ircd(8)
server. <br>
The lower part of the screen (a single line) accepts
keyboard input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some terminals do not support
certain features required by epic , in which case you
receive a message stating this. If this occurs, try changing
the terminal type or run epic with <br>
the -d option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Irc Commands: <br>
Any line beginning with the slash character &acirc;/&acirc;
is regarded as an epic command (the command character may be
changed). Any line not beginning with this character is
treated as a <br>
message to be sent to the current channel. The client has a
built in help system. Install the help files (they should be
available at the same place you got the client) and then
<br>
type &acirc;/help&acirc; to open up the help system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The .ircrc File: <br>
When epic is executed, it checks the user&rsquo;s home
directory for a ~/.ircrc file, executing the commands in the
file. Commands in this file do not need to have a leading
slash char&acirc; <br>
acter &acirc;/&acirc; This allows predefinition of aliases
and other features.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PRACTICAL EXAMPLES <br>
Certainly any description of epic in this man page will be
sorely inadequate because most of the confusion
doesn&rsquo;t even start until after you get the client to
connect to a server. <br>
But if you really have problems getting the client to
connect to a server, try some of these:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">epic Try this first. This will
assume all the defaults. If the person who is maintaining
epic at your site has done a halfway decent job, this will
put you on a server that is <br>
somewhat local to you.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">epic nickname irc.domain.com
<br>
or something similar will attempt to connect to the irc
server running on the host &quot;irc.domain.com&quot; (fill
in a real irc server here) with the nickname of well,
&quot;nickname&quot;. <br>
This is the most common way to specify an alternate server
to use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">epic nickname
irc.domain.com:6664 <br>
Sometimes, some servers are really busy, and it can take
them a long time to establish a connection with you on the
default port (6667). Most major servers on big public <br>
networks accept connections on many different ports, with
the most common being most or all of the ports between 6660
and 6675. You can usually connect much faster if you <br>
use a port other than 6667, if the server you&rsquo;re
connecting to supports an alternate port.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">epic nickname irc.efnet.net <br>
If you&rsquo;re totally stumped and trying to get on efnet,
try this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">epic nickname irc.undernet.org
<br>
If you&rsquo;re totally stumped and trying to get on
undernet, try this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">epic nickname irc.dal.net <br>
If you&rsquo;re totally stumped and trying to get on dalnet,
try this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/usr/local/bin/epic the default location of the binary</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~/.ircrc default initialization
file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~/.irc/ directory you can put
your own epic scripts into, that can then be loaded with
/load</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/usr/local/share/epic default
directory containing message-of-the-day, master
initialization, help files and epic scripts</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THE HELP FILES <br>
Starting up the client is the easy part. Once you get
connected, you&rsquo;ll probably find you have no idea what
you&rsquo;re doing. That&rsquo;s where the help files come
in. If the person who <br>
maintains irc at your site didn&rsquo;t install the help
files, pester them until they do. Once the help files are
available, use the &acirc;/help&acirc; command to get
started. There are a bazil&acirc; <br>
lion commands and a multitude of nuances that will take a
few months to get down pat. But once you do, you will be so
firmly addicted to irc that your wife will divorce you, your
<br>
kids will leave you, your dog will run away, and
you&rsquo;ll flunk all your classes, and be left to sing the
blues.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;http://www.irchelp.org/&gt;
Lots of great help for new irc users.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGNALS <br>
epic handles the following signals gracefully</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGUSR1 Closes all DCC
connections and EXEC&rsquo;d processes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
It can be helpful to predefine certain variables in in the
~/.cshrc , ~/.profile , or ~/.login file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IRCNICK The user&rsquo;s default
IRC nickname</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IRCNAME The user&rsquo;s default
IRC realname (otherwise retrieved from /etc/passwd )</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IRCSERVER The user&rsquo;s
default IRC server list (see server option for details)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOME Overrides the default home
page in /etc/password</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TERM The type of terminal
emulation to use</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
ircd(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Any non-trivial piece of software has bugs. ircII/EPIC is no
exception. You can refer to the KNOWNBUGS file that is
distributed with the client source code for a list of
problems <br>
that are known to exist and may or may not be fixed some
day. If you find a bug that is not listed there, you can
refer to the BUG_FORM file that is also distributed with the
<br>
source code. It will give you instructions on how to fill
out the report and where to send it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ERRATA <br>
The online documentation probably should be in docbook form
rather than in the current help format. The entire help
system is a hack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This manual page only describes
the options to epic, but doesn&rsquo;t tell you what to do
once you get connected.</p>
