<p>ECOS(1) General Commands Manual ECOS(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ecosconfig &acirc; eCos configuration program</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ecosconfig [--help ] [--config=file] [--prefix=dir]
[--srcdir=dir] [--no-resolve] [--ignore-errors | -i ]
[--verbose | -v ] [-q] command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This manual page documents briefly the ecosconfig
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This manual page was written for
the Debian distribution because the original program does
not have a manual page. Instead, it has documentation in the
PDF format; see below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ecosconfig is a program to
configure your eCos kernel linked with your embedded
application and creating the build tree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
This program follows the usual GNU command line syntax, with
long options starting with two dashes (&lsquo;-&rsquo;). A
summary of options is included below. For a complete
description, <br>
see the PDF files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h --help <br>
Provides basic usage guidelines for the available commands
and qualifiers. All other qualifiers and commands are
ignored if --help is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--config=file <br>
Specifies an eCos configuration save file for use by the
tool. By default, the file ecos.ecc in the current directory
is used. Developers may prefer to use a common <br>
location for all their eCos configurations rather than keep
the configuration information in the base of the build
tree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--prefix=dir <br>
Specifies an alternative location for the install tree. By
default, the install tree resides inside the install
directory in the build tree. Developers may prefer to <br>
locate the build tree in a temporary file hierarchy but keep
the install tree in a more permanent location.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--srcdir=dir <br>
Specifies the location of the component repository. By
default, the tool uses the location specified in the
ECOS_REPOSITORY environment variable. Developers may prefer
<br>
to use of this qualifier if they are working with more than
one repository.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-resolve <br>
Disables the implicit resolution of conflicts while
manipulating the configuration data. developers may prefer
to reslove conflicts by editing the eCos configuration <br>
save file manually The check command implicitely uses
--no-resolve.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ignore-errors -i <br>
By default, ecosconfig will exit with an error code if the
current configuration contains any conflicts, and it is not
possible to generate or update a build tree for <br>
such configurations. This qualifier causes ecosconfig to
ignore such problems, and hence it is possible to generate a
build tree even if there are still conflicts. Of <br>
course, there are no guarantees that the resulting system
will actually do anything useful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v --verbose <br>
Display more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Display less information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMANDS <br>
The available commands for ecosconfig are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list Lists the available
packages, targets and templates as installed in the eCos
repository. Aliases and package versions are also
reported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">new target [template [version]]
<br>
Creates a new eCos configuration for the specified target
hardware and saves it. A software template may also be
specified. By default, the template named
&lsquo;default&rsquo; is <br>
used. If the template version is not specified, the latest
version is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">target target <br>
Changes the target hardware selection for the eCos
configuration. This has the effect of unloading packages
supporting the target selected previously and loading the
<br>
packages which support the new hardware. This command will
be used typically when switching between a simulator and
real hardware.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">template template [version] <br>
Changes the template selection for the eCos configuration.
This has the effect of unloading packages specified by the
template selected previously and loading the pack&acirc;
<br>
ages specified by the new template. By default, the latest
version of the specified template is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">remove packages <br>
Removes the specified packages from the eCos configuration.
This command will be used typically when the template on
which a configuration is based contains packages <br>
which are not required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">add packages <br>
Adds the specified packages to the eCos configuration. This
command will be used typically when the template on which a
configuration is based does not contain all the <br>
packages which are required. For example, add-on packages
provided by third parties will not be known to the standard
templates so they will have to be added <br>
explicitely.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">version version packages <br>
Selects the specified version of a number of packages in the
eCos configuration. By default, the most recent version of
each package is used. This command will be used <br>
typically when an older version of a package is
required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">check Presents the following
information concerning the current configuration:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0. the selected target
hardware</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. the selected template</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. additional packages</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. removed packages</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. the selected version of
packages where this is not the most recent version</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5. conflicts in the current
configuration</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The check command will never
perform automatic conflict resolution, so there is no need
to use --no-resolve.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">resolve Resolves conflicts
identified in the current eCos configuration by invoking an
inference capability. Resolved conflicts are reported, but
not all conflicts may be <br>
resolvable. This command will be used typically following
manual editing of the configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">export file <br>
Exports a minimal eCos configurastion save file with the
specified name. This file contains only those options which
do not have their default value. Such files are <br>
used typically to transfer option values from one
configuration to another.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">import file <br>
Imports a minimal eCos configuration save file with the
specified name. The values of those options specified in the
file are applied to the current configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
The programs are documented fully by eCos User&rsquo;s Guide
<br>
available.</p>
