tiffcrop - select, copy, crop, convert, extract, and/or process one or more
  <small>TIFF</small> files.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<b>tiffcrop</b> [ <i>options</i> ] <i>src1.tif ... srcN.tif dst.tif</i>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<i>Tiffcrop</i> processes one or more files created according to the Tag Image
  File Format, Revision 6.0, specification into one or more <small>TIFF</small>
  file(s). <i>Tiffcrop</i> is most often used to extract portions of an image
  for processing with bar code recognizer or OCR software when that software
  cannot restrict the region of interest to a specific portion of the image or
  to improve efficiency when the regions of interest must be rotated. It can
  also be used to subdivide all or part of a processed image into smaller
  sections and export individual images or sections of images as separate files
  or separate images within one or more files derived from the original input
  image or images.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The available functions can be grouped broadly into three classes:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Those that select individual images or sections of images
      from the input files. The options -N for sequences or lists of individual
      images in the input files, -Z for zones, -z for regions, -X and -Y for
      fixed sized selections, -m for margins, -U for units, and -E for edge
      reference provide a variety of ways to specify portions of the input
      image.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Those that allow the individual images or selections to be
      exported to one or more output files in different groupings and control
      the organization of the data in the output images. The options -P for page
      size grouping, -S for subdivision into columns and rows and -e for export
      mode options that produce one or more files from each input image. The
      options -r, -s, -t, -w control strip and tile format and sizes while -B -L
      -c -f modify the endian addressing scheme, the compression options, and
      the bit fill sequence of images as they are written.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Those that perform some action on each image that is
      selected from the input file. The options include -R for rotate, -I for
      inversion of the photometric interpretation and/or data values, and -F to
      flip (mirror) the image horizontally or vertically.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Functions are applied to the input image(s) in the following order: cropping,
  fixed area extraction, zone and region extraction, inversion, mirroring,
  rotation.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Functions are applied to the output image(s) in the following order: export mode
  options for grouping zones, regions, or images into one or more files,
  <i>or</i> row and column divisions with output margins, <i>or</i> page size
  divisions with page orientation options.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Finally, strip, tile, byte order, output resolution, and compression options are
  applied to all output images.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The output file(s) may be organized and compressed using a different algorithm
  from the input files. By default, <i>tiffcrop</i> will copy all the understood
  tags in a <small>TIFF</small> directory of an input file to the associated
  directory in the output file. Options can be used to force the resultant image
  to be written as strips or tiles of data, respectively.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Tiffcrop</i> can be used to reorganize the storage characteristics of data in
  a file, and to reorganize, extract, rotate, and otherwise process the image
  data as specified at the same time whereas tiffcp does not alter the image
  data within the file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Using the options for selecting individual input images and the options for
  exporting images and/or segments defined as zones or regions of each input
  image, <i>tiffcrop</i> can perform the functions of tiffcp and tiffsplit in a
  single pass while applying multiple operations to individual selections or
  images.

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-N odd|even|#,#-#,#|last</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Specify one or more series or range(s) of images within
      each file to process. The words <b>odd</b> or <b>even</b> may be used to
      specify all odd or even numbered images counting from one. Note that
      internally, TIFF images are numbered from zero rather than one but since
      this convention is not obvious to most users, tiffcrop used 1 to specifiy
      the first image in a multipage file. The word <b>last</b> may be used in
      place of a number in the sequence to indicate the final image in the file
      without knowing how many images there are. Ranges of images may be
      specified with a dash and multiple sets can be indicated by joining them
      in a comma-separated list. eg. use <b>-N 1,5-7,last</b> to process the
      1st, 5th through 7th, and final image in the file.</dd>

      reference from which to calcuate the width and length of crop regions or
      sequence of postions for zones. When used with the -e option for exporting
      zones or regions, the reference edge determines how composite images are
      arranged. Using -E left or right causes successive zones or regions to be
      merged horizontally whereas using -E top or bottom causes successive zones
      or regions to be arranged vertically. This option has no effect on export
      layout when multiple zones or regions are not being exported to composite

The output images will have a specified resolution of 300 dpi in both
  directions. The orientation of each page will be determined by whichever
  choice requires the fewest pages. To specify a specific orientation, use the
  portrait or landscape option. The paper size option does not resample the
  image. It breaks each original image into a series of smaller images that will
  fit on the target paper size at the specified resolution.

Extract two regions 2048 pixels wide by 2048 pixels high from each page of a
  multi-page input file and write each region to a separate output file.

The output file names will use the stem Check with a numeric suffix which is
  incremented for each region of each image, eg Check-001.tiff, Check-002.tiff
  ... Check-NNN.tiff. To produce a unique file for each page of the input image
  with one new image for each region of the input image on that page, change the
  export option to -e multiple.

In general, bilevel, grayscale, palette and RGB(A) data with bit depths from 1
  to 32 bits should work in both interleaved and separate plane formats. Unlike
  tiffcp, tiffcrop can read and write tiled images with bits per sample that are
  not a multiple of 8 in both interleaved and separate planar format. Floating
  point data types are supported at bit depts of 16, 24, 32 and 64 bits per
  sample.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Not all images can be converted from one compression scheme to another. Data
  with some photometric interpretations and/or bit depths are tied to specific
  compression schemes and vice-versa, e.g. Group 3/4 compression is only usable
  for bilevel data. JPEG compression is only usable on 8 bit per sample data (or
  12 bit if <i>LibTIFF</i> was compiled with 12 bit JPEG support). Support for
  OJPEG compressed images is problematic at best. Since OJPEG compression is no
  longer supported for writing images with LibTIFF, these images will be updated
  to the newer JPEG compression when they are copied or processed. This may
  cause the image to appear color shifted or distorted after conversion. In some
  cases, it is possible to remove the original compression from image data using
  the option -cnone.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Tiffcrop does not currently provide options to up or downsample data to
  different bit depths or convert data from one photometric interpretation to
  another, e.g. 16 bits per sample to 8 bits per sample or RGB to grayscale.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Tiffcrop is very loosely derived from code in <i>tiffcp</i> with extensive
  modifications and additions to support the selection of input images and
  regions and the exporting of them to one or more output files in various
  groupings. The image manipulation routines are entirely new and additional
  ones may be added in the future. It will handle tiled images with bit depths
  that are not a multiple of eight that tiffcp may refuse to read.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Tiffcrop</i> was designed to handle large files containing many moderate
  sized images with memory usage that is independent of the number of images in
  the file. In order to support compression modes that are not based on
  individual scanlines, e.g. JPEG, it now reads images by strip or tile rather
  than by indvidual scanlines. In addition to the memory required by the input
  and output buffers associated with <i>LibTIFF</i> one or more buffers at least
  as large as the largest image to be read are required. The design favors large
  volume document processing uses over scientific or graphical manipulation of
  large datasets as might be found in research or remote sensing scenarios.
