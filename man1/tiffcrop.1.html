<p>TIFFCROP(1) TIFFCROP(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
tiffcrop - select, copy, crop, convert, extract, and/or
process one or more TIFF files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
tiffcrop [ options ] src1.tif ... srcN.tif dst.tif</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Tiffcrop processes one or more files created according to
the Tag Image File Format, Revision 6.0, specification into
one or more TIFF file(s). Tiffcrop is most often used to
<br>
extract portions of an image for processing with bar code
recognizer or OCR software when that software cannot
restrict the region of interest to a specific portion of the
image <br>
or to improve efficiency when the regions of interest must
be rotated. It can also be used to subdivide all or part of
a processed image into smaller sections and export
indi&acirc; <br>
vidual images or sections of images as separate files or
separate images within one or more files derived from the
original input image or images.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The available functions can be
grouped broadly into three classes:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Those that select individual
images or sections of images from the input files. The
options -N for sequences or lists of individual images in
the input files, -Z for <br>
zones, -z for regions, -X and -Y for fixed sized selections,
-m for margins, -U for units, and -E for edge reference
provide a variety of ways to specify portions of the <br>
input image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Those that allow the individual
images or selections to be exported to one or more output
files in different groupings and control the organization of
the data in the out&acirc; <br>
put images. The options -P for page size grouping, -S for
subdivision into columns and rows and -e for export mode
options that produce one or more files from each input <br>
image. The options -r, -s, -t, -w control strip and tile
format and sizes while -B -L -c -f modify the endian
addressing scheme, the compression options, and the bit fill
<br>
sequence of images as they are written.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Those that perform some action
on each image that is selected from the input file. The
options include -R for rotate, -I for inversion of the
photometric interpretation <br>
and/or data values, and -F to flip (mirror) the image
horizontally or vertically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Functions are applied to the
input image(s) in the following order: cropping, fixed area
extraction, zone and region extraction, inversion,
mirroring, rotation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Functions are applied to the
output image(s) in the following order: export mode options
for grouping zones, regions, or images into one or more
files, or row and column divi&acirc; <br>
sions with output margins, or page size divisions with page
orientation options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, strip, tile, byte
order, output resolution, and compression options are
applied to all output images.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The output file(s) may be
organized and compressed using a different algorithm from
the input files. By default, tiffcrop will copy all the
understood tags in a TIFF directory <br>
of an input file to the associated directory in the output
file. Options can be used to force the resultant image to be
written as strips or tiles of data, respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tiffcrop can be used to
reorganize the storage characteristics of data in a file,
and to reorganize, extract, rotate, and otherwise process
the image data as specified at the <br>
same time whereas tiffcp does not alter the image data
within the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using the options for selecting
individual input images and the options for exporting images
and/or segments defined as zones or regions of each input
image, tiffcrop can perform <br>
the functions of tiffcp and tiffsplit in a single pass while
applying multiple operations to individual selections or
images.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-h Display the syntax summary for tiffcrop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Report the current version
and last modification date for tiffcrop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N odd|even|#,#-#,#|last <br>
Specify one or more series or range(s) of images within each
file to process. The words odd or even may be used to
specify all odd or even numbered images counting from <br>
one. Note that internally, TIFF images are numbered from
zero rather than one but since this convention is not
obvious to most users, tiffcrop used 1 to specifiy the <br>
first image in a multipage file. The word last may be used
in place of a number in the sequence to indicate the final
image in the file without knowing how many images <br>
there are. Ranges of images may be specified with a dash and
multiple sets can be indicated by joining them in a
comma-separated list. eg. use -N 1,5-7,last to process <br>
the 1st, 5th through 7th, and final image in the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E top|bottom|left|right <br>
Specify the top, bottom, left, or right edge as the
reference from which to calcuate the width and length of
crop regions or sequence of postions for zones. When used
with <br>
the -e option for exporting zones or regions, the reference
edge determines how composite images are arranged. Using -E
left or right causes successive zones or regions to <br>
be merged horizontally whereas using -E top or bottom causes
successive zones or regions to be arranged vertically. This
option has no effect on export layout when multi&acirc; <br>
ple zones or regions are not being exported to composite
images. Edges may be abbreviated to the first letter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e
combined|divided|image|multiple|separate <br>
Specify the export mode for images and selections from input
images. The final filename on the command line is considered
to be the destination file or filename stem for <br>
automatically generated sequences of files. Modes may be
abbreviated to the first letter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">combined All images and
selections are written to a single file with multiple
selections from one image combined into a single image
(default)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">divided All images and
selections are written to a single file with each selection
from one image written to a new image</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">image Each input image is
written to a new file (numeric filename sequence) with
multiple selections from the image combined into one
image</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">multiple Each input image is
written to a new file (numeric filename sequence) with each
selection from the image written to a new image</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">separate Individual selections
from each image are written to separate files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U in|cm|px <br>
Specify the type of units to apply to dimensions for margins
and crop regions for input and output images. Inches or
centimeters are converted to pixels using the resolu&acirc;
<br>
tion unit specified in the TIFF file (which defaults to
inches if not specified in the IFD).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m #,#,#,# <br>
Specify margins to be removed from the input image. The
order must be top, left, bottom, right with only commas
separating the elements of the list. Margins are scaled <br>
according to the current units and removed before any other
extractions are computed..</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X # Set the horizontal (X-axis)
dimension of a region to extract relative to the specified
origin reference. If the origin is the top or bottom edge,
the X axis value will be <br>
assumed to start at the left edge.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Y # Set the vertical (Y-axis)
dimension of a region to extract relative to the specified
origin reference. If the origin is the left or right edge,
the Y axis value will be <br>
assumed to start at the top.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Z #:#,#:# <br>
Specify zones of the image designated as position X of Y
equal sized portions measured from the reference edge, eg
1:3 would be first third of the image starting from the <br>
reference edge minus any margins specified for the confining
edges. Multiple zones can be specified as a comma separated
list but they must reference the same edge. To <br>
extract the top quarter and the bottom third of an image you
would use -Z 1:4,3:3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z x1,y1,x2,y2: ...
:xN,yN,xN+1,yN+1 <br>
Specify a series of coordinates to define regions for
processing and exporting. The coordinates represent the top
left and lower right corners of each region in the
cur&acirc; <br>
rent units, eg inch, cm, or pixels. Pixels are counted from
one to width or height and inches or cm are calculated from
image resolution data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each colon delimited series of
four values represents the horizontal and vertical offsets
from the top and left edges of the image, regardless of the
edge specified with <br>
the -E option. The first and third values represent the
horizontal offsets of the corner points from the left edge
while the second and fourth values represent the
verti&acirc; <br>
cal offsets from the top edge.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F horiz|vert <br>
Flip, ie mirror, the image or extracted region horizontally
or vertically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R 90|180|270 <br>
Rotate the image or extracted region 90, 180, or 270 degrees
clockwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I [black|white|data|both] <br>
Invert color space, eg dark to light for bilevel and
grayscale images. This can be used to modify negative images
to positive or to correct images that have the
PHOTOMET&acirc; <br>
RIC_INTERPRETATIN tag set incorrectly. If the value is black
or white, the PHOTOMETRIC_INTERPRETATION tag is set to
MinIsBlack or MinIsWhite, without altering the image <br>
data. If the argument is data or both, the data values of
the image are modified. Specifying both inverts the data and
the PHOTOMETRIC_INTERPRETATION tag, whereas using <br>
data inverts the data but not the PHOTOMETRIC_INTERPRETATION
tag. No support for modifying the color space of color
images in this release.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H # Set the horizontal
resolution of output images to # expressed in the current
units.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V # Set the vertical resolution
of the output images to # expressed in the current
units.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-J # Set the horizontal margin
of an output page size to # expressed in the current units
when sectioning image into columns x rows subimages using
the -S cols:rows option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-K # Set the vertical margin of
an output page size to # expressed in the current units when
sectioning image into columns x rows submiages using the -S
cols:rows option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O portrait|landscape|auto <br>
Set the output orientation of the pages or sections. Auto
will use the arrangement that requires the fewest pages.
This option is only meaningful in conjunction with the <br>
-P option to format an image to fit on a specific paper
size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P page <br>
Format the output images to fit on page size paper. Use -P
list to show the supported page sizes and dimensions. You
can define a custom page size by entering the width <br>
and length of the page in the current units with the
following format #.#x#.#.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S cols:rows <br>
Divide each image into cols across and rows down equal
sections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B Force output to be written
with Big-Endian byte order. This option only has an effect
when the output file is created or overwritten and not when
it is appended to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C Suppress the use of
&lsquo;&lsquo;strip chopping&rsquo;&rsquo; when reading
images that have a single strip/tile of uncompressed
data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Specify the compression to
use for data written to the output file: none for no
compression, packbits for PackBits compression, lzw for
Lempel-Ziv &amp; Welch compression, <br>
jpeg for baseline JPEG compression. zip for Deflate
compression, g3 for CCITT Group 3 (T.4) compression, and g4
for CCITT Group 4 (T.6) compression. By default tiffcrop
<br>
will compress data according to the value of the Compression
tag found in the source file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The CCITT Group 3 and Group 4
compression algorithms can only be used with bilevel
data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Group 3 compression can be
specified together with several T.4-specific options: 1d for
1-dimensional encoding, 2d for 2-dimensional encoding, and
fill to force each <br>
encoded scanline to be zero-filled so that the terminating
EOL code lies on a byte boundary. Group 3-specific options
are specified by appending a
&lsquo;&lsquo;:&rsquo;&rsquo;-separated list to <br>
the &lsquo;&lsquo;g3&rsquo;&rsquo; option; e.g. -c
g3:2d:fill to get 2D-encoded data with byte-aligned EOL
codes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LZW compression can be specified
together with a predictor value. A predictor value of 2
causes each scanline of the output image to undergo
horizontal differencing <br>
before it is encoded; a value of 1 forces each scanline to
be encoded without differencing. LZW-specific options are
specified by appending a
&lsquo;&lsquo;:&rsquo;&rsquo;-separated list to the <br>
&lsquo;&lsquo;lzw&rsquo;&rsquo; option; e.g. -c lzw:2 for
LZW compression with horizontal differencing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Specify the bit fill order to
use in writing output data. By default, tiffcrop will create
a new file with the same fill order as the original.
Specifying -f lsb2msb <br>
will force data to be written with the FillOrder tag set to
LSB2MSB, while -f msb2lsb will force data to be written with
the FillOrder tag set to MSB2LSB.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i Ignore non-fatal read errors
and continue processing of the input file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l Specify the length of a tile
(in pixels). Tiffcrop attempts to set the tile dimensions so
that no more than 8 kilobytes of data appear in a tile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L Force output to be written
with Little-Endian byte order. This option only has an
effect when the output file is created or overwritten and
not when it is appended to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M Suppress the use of
memory-mapped files when reading images.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p Specify the planar
configuration to use in writing image data that has more
than one sample per pixel. By default, tiffcrop will create
a new file with the same planar <br>
configuration as the original. Specifying -p contig will
force data to be written with multi-sample data packed
together, while -p separate will force samples to be
writ&acirc; <br>
ten in separate planes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Specify the number of rows
(scanlines) in each strip of data written to the output
file. By default (or when value 0 is specified), tiffcrop
attempts to set the <br>
rows/strip that no more than 8 kilobytes of data appear in a
strip. If you specify the special value -1 it will results
in infinite number of the rows per strip. The <br>
entire image will be the one strip in that case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Force the output file to be
written with data organized in strips (rather than
tiles).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Force the output file to be
written with data organized in tiles (rather than
strips).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w Specify the width of a tile
(in pixels). tiffcrop attempts to set the tile dimensions so
that no more than 8 kilobytes of data appear in a tile.
tiffcrop attempts to set <br>
the tile dimensions so that no more than 8 kilobytes of data
appear in a tile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Debug and dump facility <br>
-D opt1:value1,opt2:value2,opt3:value3:opt4:value4 Display
program progress and/or dump raw data to non-TIFF files.
Options include the following and must be joined as a <br>
comma separated list. The use of this option is generally
limited to program debugging and development of future
options. An equal sign may be substituted for the colon in
<br>
option:value pairs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">debug:N Display limited program
progress indicators where larger N increase the level of
detail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">format:txt|raw Format any logged
data as ASCII text or raw binary values. ASCII text dumps
include strings of ones and zeroes representing the binary
values in the image <br>
data plus identifying headers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">level:N Specify the level of
detail presented in the dump files. This can vary from dumps
of the entire input or output image data to dumps of data
processed by <br>
specific functions. Current range of levels is 1 to 3.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">input:full-path-to-directory/input-dumpname</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">output:full-path-to-directory/output-dumpname</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When dump files are being
written, each image will be written to a separate file with
the name built by adding a numeric sequence value to the
dumpname and an extension of <br>
.txt for ASCII dumps or .bin for binary dumps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The four debug/dump options are
independent, though it makes little sense to specify a dump
file without specifying a detail level.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: Tiffcrop may be compiled
with -DDEVELMODE to enable additional very <br>
low level debug reporting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
The following concatenates two files and writes the result
using LZW encoding: <br>
tiffcrop -c lzw a.tif b.tif result.tif</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To convert a G3 1d-encoded TIFF
to a single strip of G4-encoded data the following might be
used: <br>
tiffcrop -c g4 -r 10000 g3.tif g4.tif <br>
(1000 is just a number that is larger than the number of
rows in the source file.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To extract a selected set of
images from a multi-image TIFF file use the -N option
described above. Thus, to copy the 1st and 3rd images of
image file &quot;album.tif&quot; to <br>
&quot;result.tif&quot;: <br>
tiffcrop -N 1,3 album.tif result.tif</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Invert a bilevel image scan of a
microfilmed document and crop off margins of 0.25 inches on
the left and right, 0.5 inch on the top, and 0.75 inch on
the bottom. From the <br>
remaining portion of the image, select the second and third
quarters, ie, one half of the area left from the center to
each margin. <br>
tiffcrop -U in -m 0.5,0.25,0.75,0.25 -E left -Z 2:4,3:4 -I
both MicrofilmNegative.tif MicrofilmPostiveCenter.tif</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Extract only the final image of
a large Architectural E sized multipage TIFF file and rotate
it 90 degrees clockwise while reformatting the output to fit
on tabloid sized sheets <br>
with one quarter of an inch on each side: <br>
tiffcrop -N last -R 90 -O auto -P tabloid -U in -J 0.25 -K
0.25 -H 300 -V 300 Big-PlatMap.tif BigPlatMap-Tabloid.tif
<br>
The output images will have a specified resolution of 300
dpi in both directions. The orientation of each page will be
determined by whichever choice requires the fewest pages.
<br>
To specify a specific orientation, use the portrait or
landscape option. The paper size option does not resample
the image. It breaks each original image into a series of
smaller <br>
images that will fit on the target paper size at the
specified resolution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Extract two regions 2048 pixels
wide by 2048 pixels high from each page of a multi-page
input file and write each region to a separate output file.
<br>
tiffcrop -U px -z 1,1,2048,2048:1,2049,2048,4097 -e separate
CheckScans.tiff Check <br>
The output file names will use the stem Check with a numeric
suffix which is incremented for each region of each image,
eg Check-001.tiff, Check-002.tiff ... Check-NNN.tiff. To
<br>
produce a unique file for each page of the input image with
one new image for each region of the input image on that
page, change the export option to -e multiple.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
In general, bilevel, grayscale, palette and RGB(A) data with
bit depths from 1 to 32 bits should work in both interleaved
and separate plane formats. Unlike tiffcp, tiffcrop can <br>
read and write tiled images with bits per sample that are
not a multiple of 8 in both interleaved and separate planar
format. Floating point data types are supported at bit depts
<br>
of 16, 24, 32 and 64 bits per sample.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Not all images can be converted
from one compression scheme to another. Data with some
photometric interpretations and/or bit depths are tied to
specific compression schemes and <br>
vice-versa, e.g. Group 3/4 compression is only usable for
bilevel data. JPEG compression is only usable on 8 bit per
sample data (or 12 bit if LibTIFF was compiled with 12 bit
<br>
JPEG support). Support for OJPEG compressed images is
problematic at best. Since OJPEG compression is no longer
supported for writing images with LibTIFF, these images will
be <br>
updated to the newer JPEG compression when they are copied
or processed. This may cause the image to appear color
shifted or distorted after conversion. In some cases, it is
<br>
possible to remove the original compression from image data
using the option -cnone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tiffcrop does not currently
provide options to up or downsample data to different bit
depths or convert data from one photometric interpretation
to another, e.g. 16 bits per sam&acirc; <br>
ple to 8 bits per sample or RGB to grayscale.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tiffcrop is very loosely derived
from code in tiffcp with extensive modifications and
additions to support the selection of input images and
regions and the exporting of them to <br>
one or more output files in various groupings. The image
manipulation routines are entirely new and additional ones
may be added in the future. It will handle tiled images with
<br>
bit depths that are not a multiple of eight that tiffcp may
refuse to read.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tiffcrop was designed to handle
large files containing many moderate sized images with
memory usage that is independent of the number of images in
the file. In order to support <br>
compression modes that are not based on individual
scanlines, e.g. JPEG, it now reads images by strip or tile
rather than by indvidual scanlines. In addition to the
memory <br>
required by the input and output buffers associated with
LibTIFF one or more buffers at least as large as the largest
image to be read are required. The design favors large
vol&acirc; <br>
ume document processing uses over scientific or graphical
manipulation of large datasets as might be found in research
or remote sensing scenarios.</p>
