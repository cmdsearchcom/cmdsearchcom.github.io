<p>TZ_CONVERT(1) TZ_CONVERT(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
tz_convert - Timezone converter from operating system tz
format into libical format used by Orage and several other
calander tools.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
tz_convert [OPTION...] [INFILE]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
tz_convert is a command line tool, which can be used to
convert timezone data from so called tz binary format,
usually used in operating systems, to libical format, used
by <br>
several calenders like Orage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are several options
available to only convert certain files or files in certain
directory. Or only convert part of the file and ignore for
example old data. It is also <br>
possible to add new timezone files, which are based on old
timezone data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are tools, which generate
ical timezones data from tz source database, but those are
often not available for normal users and are difficult to
use. So often libical <br>
timezones are not upto date. tz_convert reads directly the
binary tz data and makes it possible to keep libical
timezones up to date. The tool is mainly meant to be used by
<br>
distro maintainers, but it should be easy and clear enough
for all users.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
tz timezone files often can be found in directory
/usr/share/zoneinfo. For example Europe/Helsinki. libical
timezone files needs to be where you calendar can find them.
For Xfce <br>
and Orage systems they are located under your Xfce directory
in share/orage/libical/zoneinfo. For example
Europe/Helsinki.ics. (use locate to find them.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-V, --version <br>
Print version information and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-?, --help <br>
Show this help message and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--usage <br>
Show short usage summary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i, --infile <br>
tz file name from operating system to convert from. If this
is directory, all files in it are processed. Default is
/usr/share/zoneinfo</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o, --outfile <br>
ical timezone file name to be written. This can not be
directory. It is meant to be used together with timezone
parameter. This is very seldom used. Default is <br>
timezone/infile.ics</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m, --message <br>
debug message level. How much exra information is shown. 0
is least and 10 is highest (1=default). May give usefull
information when things do not work as expected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, --limit <br>
limit processing to newer than this year. Often there is a
lot of old data available, which is not needed in normal day
to day work and skipping unused years helps to improve <br>
performance. Default is to ignore older than year 1970 time
changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t, --timezone <br>
timezone name to be used in the actual file. Normally file
name is the same as timezone name, but if you want to create
your own timezone, you need new file name, which <br>
contains some known timezone name. This is used together
with outfile parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, --norecursive <br>
process only main directory, instead of all subdirectories.
0 = recursive 1 = only main directory (0=default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --exclude count <br>
number of excluded directories. 5 = default (You only need
this if you have more than 5 excluded directories). This is
used together with exclude parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x, --exclude <br>
do not process this directory, skip it. You can give several
directories with separate parameters. By default directories
right and posix are excluded, but if you use this <br>
parameter, you have to specify those also. You need to use
exclude count if you have more than 5 exclude
directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u, --norrule <br>
do not use RRULE ical repeating rule, but use RDATE instead.
Not all calendars are able to understand RRULE correctly
with timezones. (Orage should work fine with RRULE). 0 =
<br>
use RRULE 1 = do not use RRULE (0=default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>

http://bugzilla.xfce.org/. Note that tz_convert is part of
orage so bugs are reported against orage and component
tz_convert. <br>
Usage related questions can be sent to xfce@xfce.org email
