<p>MARK(1) General Commands Manual MARK(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
mark - manipulate message sequences</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
mark [+folder] [msgs] [-sequence name ...] [-add | -delete]
[-list] [-public | -nopublic] [-zero | -nozero] [-version]
[-help]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The mark command manipulates message sequences by adding or
deleting message numbers from folder-specific message
sequences, or by listing those sequences and messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A message sequence is a keyword,
just like one of the &acirc;reserved&acirc; message names,
such as &acirc;first&acirc; or &acirc;next&acirc;. Unlike
the &acirc;reserved&acirc; message names, which have a fixed
semantics on a <br>
per-folder basis, the semantics of a message sequence may be
defined, modified, and removed by the user. Message
sequences are folder-specific, e.g., the sequence name
&acirc;seen&acirc; in <br>
the context of folder &acirc;+inbox&acirc; need not have any
relation whatsoever to the sequence of the same name in a
folder of a different name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Three action switches direct the
operation of mark. These switches are mutually exclusive:
the last occurrence of any of them overrides any previous
occurrence of the other two.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -add switch tells mark to
add messages to sequences or to create a new sequence. For
each sequence named via the -sequence name argument (which
must occur at least once) the <br>
messages named via msgs (which defaults to &acirc;cur&acirc;
if no msgs are given), are added to the sequence. The
messages to be added need not be absent from the sequence.
If the -zero <br>
switch is specified, the sequence will be emptied prior to
adding the messages. Hence, -add -zero means that each
sequence should be initialized to the indicated messages,
while <br>
-add -nozero means that each sequence should be appended to
by the indicated messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -delete switch tells mark to
delete messages from sequences, and is the dual of -add. For
each of the named sequences, the named messages are removed
from the sequence. <br>
These messages need not be already present in the sequence.
If the -zero switch is specified, then all messages in the
folder are added to the sequence (first creating the <br>
sequence, if necessary) before removing the messages. Hence,
-delete -zero means that each sequence should contain all
messages except those indicated, while -delete -nozero <br>
means that only the indicated messages should be removed
from each sequence. As expected, the command &acirc;mark
-sequence foo -delete all&acirc; empties the sequence
&acirc;foo&acirc;, and therefore <br>
removes that sequence from the current folder&rsquo;s list
of sequences.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When creating or modifying
sequences, you can specify the switches -public or -nopublic
to force the new or modified sequences to be
&acirc;public&acirc; or &acirc;private&acirc;. The switch
-public <br>
indicates that the sequences should be made
&acirc;public&acirc;. These sequences will then be readable
by all nmh users with permission to read the relevant
folders. In contrast, the <br>
-nopublic switch indicates that the sequences should be made
&acirc;private&acirc;, and will only be accessible by you.
If neither of these switches is specified, then existing
sequences <br>
will maintain their current status, and new sequences will
default to &acirc;public&acirc; if you have write permission
for the relevant folder. Check the mh-sequence(5) man page
for more <br>
details about the difference between &acirc;public&acirc;
and &acirc;private&acirc; sequences.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -list switch tells mark to
list both the sequences defined for the folder and the
messages associated with those sequences. Mark will list the
name of each sequence given by <br>
-sequence name and the messages associated with that
sequence. If the sequence is private, this will also be
indicated. If no sequence is specified by the -sequence
switch, <br>
then all sequences for this folder will be listed. The -zero
switch does not affect the operation of -list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The restrictions on sequences
are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The name used to
denote a message sequence must consist of an alphabetic
character followed by zero or more alphanumeric characters,
and cannot be one of the (reserved) message <br>
names &acirc;new&acirc;, &acirc;first&acirc;,
&acirc;last&acirc;, &acirc;all&acirc;, &acirc;next&acirc;,
or &acirc;prev&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Message ranges
with user-defined sequence names are restricted to the form
&acirc;name:n&acirc;, &acirc;name:+n&acirc;, or
&acirc;name:-n&acirc;, and refer to the first or last
&lsquo;n&rsquo; messages of the sequence <br>
&lsquo;name&rsquo;, respectively. Constructs of the form
&acirc;name1-name2&acirc; are forbidden for user defined
sequences.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
$HOME/.mh_profile The user&rsquo;s profile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROFILE COMPONENTS <br>
Path: To determine the user&rsquo;s nmh directory. <br>
Current-Folder: To find the default current folder.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
flist(1), pick(1), mh-sequence(5)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEFAULTS <br>
+folder The current folder. <br>
-add If -sequence is specified, -list otherwise. <br>
msgs The current message, or all if -list is specified. <br>
-nozero</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONTEXT <br>
If a folder is given, it will become the current folder.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HELPFUL HINTS <br>
Use flist to find folders with a given sequence, and
&acirc;pick sequence -list&acirc; to enumerate those
messages in the sequence (such as for use by a shell
script).</p>
