makepp_repositories -- How to use repositories for variant builds, for
  maintaining a central set of sources, and other things
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
A <b>repository</b> is a directory or directory hierarchy outside of the default
  directory that contains files which the makefile needs in the current
  directory tree. Makepp can automatically link files from the repository into
  the current directory tree if they are needed. Repositories provide similar
  functionality to the &quot;VPATH&quot; variable, but (unlike &quot;VPATH&quot;
  in other versions of make) you do not have to do anything special to your
  makefile to get them to work.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Repositories are specified with the &quot;-R&quot; or &quot;--repository&quot;
  command line option or with the &quot;repository&quot; statement in the
  makefile. Note that if you have a habit of calling makepp in different
  subdirectories of your build tree, it is easy to accidentally reimport a
  repository somewhere else. As a safeguard against this, if you use
  <i>RootMakeppfile</i>, makepp will refuse to start if it finds one above or
  below where it would be imported.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This is somewhat comparable to operating system union filesystems (unionfs...)
  The current directory is like the highest level writable layer. All
  repositories are like lower read-only layers.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Repositories are useful in several different situations:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">When you want to place your object and executable files in
      a separate directory, but the makefile is written to place them in the
      same directory as the sources.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">When you want to build the same program two different ways
      (e.g., with two different sets of compilation options, or for two
      different architectures).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">When you don't have write access to all or part of the
      source tree.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">When several developers are working on the same project,
      and there is a common source repository containing all the sources for the
      project. Each developer can modify only the files he needs to change in
      his local directory without affecting the other developers, and makepp
      will automatically fetch the unmodified files from the source
    repository.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Makepp's implementation of repositories does not require rewriting of the build
  commands at all, unlike (for example) repositories in cons. Makepp puts a
  symbolic link into the directory where the command is expecting it. As long as
  the command does not refer to absolute directories, the exact same shell
  command will work with files from a repository. This means that it works not
  only for compilation commands, but any kind of command you can think to put in
  your makefile.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Makepp has another kind of mechanism called a <i>build cache</i> which solves
  some of the same sorts of problems as repositories in a different way.
  Depending on your problem, a build cache may be more useful than a repository.
  See makepp_build_cache for information about build caches and a comparison of
  build caches and repositories.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Examples"><a class="selflink" href="#Examples">Examples</a></h2>
Repositories are best explained by several examples of what you can do.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Different compilation options</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Suppose you have a simple program with a makefile that looks something like
  this:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    CFLAGS      = -O2
    OBJECTS = a.o b.o c.o
    my_program: $(OBJECTS)
        cc $(inputs) -o $(output)
 
    %.o: %.c
        cc $(CFLAGS) -c $(input) -o $(output)
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This makefile places the files &quot;a.o&quot;, &quot;b.o&quot;,
  &quot;c.o&quot;, and &quot;my_program&quot; in the same directory as the
  source files.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Sometimes you want to place the binary files into a separate directory. For
  example, you might build your program on several different architectures, and
  you don't want the binary files on one architecture to be replaced with the
  binary files on the other. Or you might want to make a temporary change and
  recompile without wiping out the previous compilation results. Without
  repositories, you would have to modify your makefile to place the objects
  elsewhere.
<div class="Pp"></div>
With a repository, however, you don't have to touch your makefile at all.
  Consider the following sequence of commands:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    % cd my_program_source
    % makepp                    # Builds using the above makefile, and
                                # object files go into the directory
                                # my_program_source.
    % cd ..
    % mkdir binary-debug        # Make a clean directory for building the
    % cd binary-debug           # same program with different options.
    % makepp -R ../my_program_source CFLAGS=-g
                                # Now objects go into binary-debug.
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The first makepp command compiles the source files with optimization and puts
  the objects into the directory &quot;my_program_source&quot;, because that's
  what the makefile is supposed to do. Now we want to rebuild the program, but
  we want to change the value of &quot;CFLAGS&quot; to compile for debug. We
  specify the new value of &quot;CFLAGS&quot; on the command line, and we also
  tell makepp that the &quot;my_program_source&quot; directory is a repository
  using the &quot;-R&quot; option.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Every time makepp realizes that it needs a file that it doesn't already have in
  current directory, it looks in the repository. In this case, it first looks
  for the makefile, which doesn't exist in the &quot;binary-debug&quot;
  subdirectory. So it creates a symbolic link to it from the makefile in
  &quot;my_program_source&quot;, and then reads in the makefile. Then it notices
  that it needs the file &quot;a.c&quot; in order to build &quot;a.o&quot;, and
  so it links in &quot;a.c&quot; from the repository. If &quot;a.c&quot;
  includes any files contained in &quot;my_program_source&quot;, then these will
  be automatically linked in as well. Note: Those links are useful for things
  like debugging, but if you don't like them, &quot;makeppclean -R&quot; can
  remove them.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Running the build command in &quot;binary-debug&quot; won't touch any of the
  files in &quot;my_program_source&quot;. Thus from the same set of source
  files, you now have two different copies of the program, one compiled with
  optimization and one compiled for debug. And this happened without touching
  the makefile at all.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The advantage of using repositories instead of simply recompiling and
  overwriting the original binaries is that now if we fix our bugs and want to
  go back to the optimized version, we don't have to recompile everything. Since
  the original object files are still around, and most of them are still valid,
  we can save a lot of time on recompilation. This does not make a big
  difference when only three source files are involved, but for a larger build
  that takes minutes or hours to complete, the savings in programmer time and
  frustration can be significant.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Rebuilding one file with a minor modification to the compilation commands</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Makepp doesn't fetch only source files from the repository. If the object files
  in the repository don't need rebuilding, it will use them. For example,
  consider a slight modification to the above makefile:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    CFLAGS   := -O2
    A_CFLAGS := -O6 -funroll-loops
 
    OBJECTS := a.o b.o c.o
 
    my_program: $(OBJECTS)
        cc $(inputs) -o $(output)
 
    %.o: %.c
        cc $(CFLAGS) -c $(input) -o $(output)
 
    a.o: a.c
        cc $(A_CFLAGS) -c $(input) -o $(output)
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The idea is that &quot;a.o&quot; contains the time-critical code, so it is
  compiled with higher optimization than the rest of the objects. Now suppose we
  want to test just how different the timing is with different compile options.
  A repository can help with this, too:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    % cd my_program_source
    % makepp                    # Builds using the above makefile, and
                                # object files go into the directory
                                # my_program_source.
    % cd ..
    % mkdir no-unrolling        # Make a clean directory for building the
    % cd no-unrolling           # same program with different options.
    % makepp -R ../my_program_source A_CFLAGS=-O2
    % cd ..
    % time no-unrolling/my_program # Benchmark the two versions of the program.
    % time my_program_source/my_program
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Makepp proceeds as before, linking in a copy of the makefile and then examining
  the object files. Now only the &quot;a.o&quot; module needs recompiling, since
  the options for &quot;b.o&quot; and &quot;c.o&quot; haven't changed. Makepp
  notices that it can use &quot;b.o&quot; and &quot;c.o&quot; from the
  repository, so it just links those in. However, it will recompile
  &quot;a.o&quot; in the &quot;no-unrolling&quot; directory. Once the
  compilation is finished, the two different versions of the program can be
  benchmarked.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Rebuilding with a minor modification to the source</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Now suppose we want to make a change to &quot;a.c&quot; and benchmark the
  program before and after the change. Repositories can help again. Consider
  this sequence of commands:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    % mkdir modified-a
    % cp my_program_source/a.c modified-a
    % cd modified-a
    % emacs a.c                 # Make some modifications just to this module.
    % makepp -R ../my_program_source
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Here we have created a new directory that just contains the single source file
  we want to modify. Makepp now takes &quot;a.c&quot; from the
  &quot;modified-a&quot; subdirectory, but uses the copies of &quot;b&quot; and
  &quot;c&quot; from the &quot;my_program_source&quot; directory. Without
  changing any of the binary files in &quot;my_program_source&quot;, we have
  created a separate copy of the program that incorporates our changes to
  &quot;a.c&quot;. If there are other developers using the sources in
  &quot;my_program_source&quot;, they will be unaffected by our changes.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Repositories can thus be used as a quick way to build variants of a program,
  without adding complicated conditions to the makefile. None of the files in
  the original directory are modified; they are used as needed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Using a directory hierarchy</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
A repository is actually not just a single directory, it's a whole directory
  hierarchy. Suppose you use <i>/our/library</i> as a repository. Now
  <i>/our/library</i> may well contain many subdirectories, e.g.,
  <i>/our/library/gui</i> and <i>/our/library/network</i>. Consider this
  command:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    % makepp -R /our/library
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Any commands in the makefile that refer to files in the directory
  <i>./network</i> will actually get files from <i>/our/library/network</i>, and
  similarly for <i>./gui</i>. Makepp automatically creates any directories that
  exist in the repository but not in the current directory.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Linking to any place in the file system</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
All of the above examples show files from a repository being linked into the
  current directory or its subdirectories, but you can actually have makepp link
  them into any place in the file system that you have write access to. This is
  done by specifying &quot;-R&#x00A0;new-location=old-location&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For example, sometimes it's a little tedious to type the following:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
       mkdir alternate-build
       cd alternate-build
       makepp -R ..
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can do it all with one command, like this:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
       makepp -R alternate-build=. -F alternate-build
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;-F&quot; or &quot;-makeppfile&quot; changes to that directory before
  loading the makefile. You must specify &quot;-R&quot; before &quot;-F&quot;.
  Note that this example puts the new build tree inside the repository. That
  will not work if you use a <i>RootMakeppfile</i> because makepp safeguards
  against nested trees. It's also not a good idea if you use <i>**</i>, because
  if you ever build in the repository it will also find edited and generated
  files in this subtree.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Assigning a different location in the file system may be also useful for more
  complicated builds, where there are several library subdirectories. For
  example, here's a command I have used to build variants of one of my programs:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    % makepp -R test-build/seescape=/src/seescape \
         -R test-build/HLib=/src/HLib \
         -R test-build/H5pp=/src/H5pp \
         -R qwt=/src/external_libraries/qwt \
         -F test-build/seescape
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This command loads in files from four different repositories, and then cds to
  the <i>./test-build/seescape</i> directory and executes the makefile there.
  Files contained in the directory tree beginning with <i>/src/seescape</i> are
  linked into <i>./test-build/seescape</i>. In other words, makepp will
  temporarily link the file <i>/src/seescape/gui/image_canvas.cxx</i> to
  <i>./test-build/seescape/gui/image_canvas.cxx</i> when it is needed. This
  command will work even if the &quot;test-build&quot; directory doesn't exist
  yet; makepp will create it for you. (But you must specify the &quot;-R&quot;
  options before the &quot;-F&quot; option on the command line.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Multiple equivalent repositories</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Say your project is maintained by several fairly autonomous groups. You could
  have one complete repository with all the sources as they are in production or
  at least successfully tested. Every group can have a mostly empty repository
  with (part of) the same structure, containing the files group members have
  finished developing.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Developers' current directories will have the files they are still working on.
  The group repository will be the first one given and the production repository
  the last one, so that it furnishes the files not found in the group
  repository:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    $ makepp -R/path/to/group/repository -R/path/to/production/repository
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Since this is probably fairly static for that directory, you may want to put a
  file <i>.makepprc</i> at its root with the following content:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    -R/path/to/group/repository -R/path/to/production/repository
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Or, presuming that it has a fixed path, you could write into your makefile:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    repository /path/to/production/repository
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
and, because options are seen before makefiles are read, you can then call just
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    $ makepp -R/path/to/group/repository
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Repositories as fixed part of your build system</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you know you always use some repository you can use the
  &quot;repository&quot; or &quot;vpath&quot; statements in your makefile.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Caveats_with_repositories"><a class="selflink" href="#Caveats_with_repositories">Caveats
  with repositories</a></h2>
<i>When the links get in the way</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
For finding your way around your file hierarchy and for allowing the debugger to
  find the sources it is useful to have the links used while building. But when
  you want to edit a file or resync it with your version control, the links can
  get in the way. That is because the system traverses the link and writes to
  the file in the repository. Unless it's your personal repository used just for
  keeping things apart, that may not be what you want.
<div class="Pp"></div>
As a safeguard against inadvertent overwriting of public files it is suggested
  to make the sources in the repository unwritable. It might even not be enough
  to remove the write bit, because a version control system which insists on
  your locking the files for editing might also do that, but temporarily make
  the file writable while resyncing it. If that is the case for you, the
  repository should actually belong to a different user.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There are a few tactics to surmount this:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Keep the sources you edit in a repository, separate from
      your build tree. Whenever you put a file, which was previously fetched
      from another repository, into this editing repository, makepp will notice
      and fetch it from there, provided it is the first repository you
    specify.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Remember to delete any file, before you create a copy for
      writing. If you follow the safeguard suggestion above, forgetting to do
      this will give an error message when writing. To help you, the following
      function &quot;delink&quot; will replace one link by a copy of the linked
      file. The first variant is for all kinds of Bournish Shells, the second
      one for csh (or at least tcsh):
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    $ delink() { { rm $1 &amp;&amp; cat &gt;$1; } &lt;$1; }
    % alias delink '( rm \!:1 &amp;&amp; cat &gt;\!:1; ) &lt;\!:1'
    </pre>
  </dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If you feel you don't need them, you can delete them all,
      whenever you want, e.g. after every makepp run, possibly backgrounded
      (either short or long form):
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    makeppclean --recurse --only-repository-links
    mppc -rR
    </pre>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Don't build in a repository during use</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
A repository is meant to be read-only while it is being used as a repository.
  Makepp will <b>not</b> work properly if you change files in your repository
  during the course of a build. Nightly builds may be ok for you, if no one else
  uses the repository at that time. Before it starts the build, makepp gets a
  list of all the files that exist in the repository, and never updates its
  list, except for files it expects to appear.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you need a repository that's changing as you build, you might want to
  consider makepp's build cache mechanism (see makepp_build_cache).
  Alternatively, you can use a &quot;poor man's repository&quot;: you can put
  explicit rules into your makefile to create the soft links, like this:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    %.c : $(directory_I_wish_was_a_repository)/%.c
        &amp;ln -fs $(input) $(output)
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This works only for source files; you can't easily use this to link a file if it
  is already built in the repository, but build it here if it's not already
  built, since there is only allowed to be one way to build a file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Use only relative filenames</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Repositories work completely transparently <i>if the makefiles use only</i>
  <i>relative filenames</i>. In the above example, it's ok if the makefile in
  <i>/src/seescape</i> refers to <i>../HLib</i>, but the above command will not
  work as expected if it refers to <i>/src/HLib</i>. If you need to use absolute
  file names, you can put them into make variables and then override them on the
  command line, like this:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    % makepp -R test-build/seescape=/src/seescape SEESCAPE=/home/holt/test-build/seescape \
         -R test-build/HLib=/src/HLib HLIB=/home/holt/test-build/HLib \
         -R test-build/H5pp=/src/H5pp H5pp=/home/holt/test-build/H5pp \
         -R qwt=/src/external_libraries/qwt QWT=/home/holt/test-build/qwt \
         -F test-build/seescape
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The above will work as long as the &quot;HLib&quot; directory is referred to as
  &quot;$(HLIB)&quot; in all the makefiles. Note that you have to specify
  absolute paths for the directories, because makepp cd's to
  &quot;test-build/seescape&quot; before reading the makefile. This leads to
  long and complicated make commands; use relative paths when possible.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Makepp must know about all dependencies</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Repositories will not work if there are hidden dependencies that makepp doesn't
  know about. (In fact, doing a build using repositories, is one way of checking
  for forgotten dependencies. But, just for this check, don't combine it with a
  build cache, since fetching something there, instead of building it, might
  hide a forgotten dependency.) Sometimes these dependencies can be fairly
  subtle. For example, the <i>libtool</i> command will not only create
  &quot;.lo&quot; and &quot;.la&quot; files as listed on the command line, but
  it also may create a subdirectory called &quot;.libs&quot; which contains the
  actual object files. To prevent build mistakes, makepp refuses to link in a
  &quot;.la&quot; file from a repository. Hopefully in the future libtool will
  be better supported.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Many hidden dependencies related to compilation are caught by the command line
  scanner. If your compiler uses the common Unix compilation flags (e.g.,
  &quot;-I&quot;, &quot;-D&quot;, etc.), then makepp will usually figure out
  where all your include files are. You may have to be careful if you have any
  homegrown scripts that create files that makepp doesn't know about. For
  correct builds, it is vitally important to list <b>all</b> targets and
  dependencies (or determine them automatically by scanning).
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Putting absolute filenames into programs</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Repositories will also not work if any of the files built contain absolute file
  names in them (e.g., if any of your build commands write out an absolute
  filename). For example, it turns out that the &quot;.la&quot; files produced
  by <i>libtool</i> have this property. (If you look at the contents of the
  &quot;.la&quot; file you'll see that the dependency list contains absolute
  filenames.) In order to solve this particular problem, makepp will not link
  &quot;.la&quot; files from a repository; it will insist on rebuilding them.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Avoid linking in unnecessary directories</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Repositories can be slow on startup and use a lot of memory if there are a lot
  of unnecessary files in the repository. For example, if you use an automatic
  HTML documentation generator which makes thousands of &quot;.html&quot; files
  from your source code, you may not want to put them in a subdirectory of a
  directory that's used as a repository. It's better to put them in a different
  directory tree entirely, so the repository mechanism won't load in their
  names.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Too Many Files</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The disadvantage of repositories is that symbolic links, which the repository
  mechanism uses, are individual files (though they use almost no disk space).
  This is unlike real links, but those can't cross file system boundaries. In
  extreme cases the presence of very many symbolic links can lead to exhaustion
  of the number of foreseen files (so called inodes), even though there is
  plenty of space left. In this case the sysadmin will need to tune the file
  system.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Overriding_repository_copies"><a class="selflink" href="#Overriding_repository_copies">Overriding
  repository copies</a></h2>
If you make any modifications to a file locally, makepp will ordinarily realize
  this and recompile the file using the local copy rather than the repository
  copy.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you're using a repository to maintain a central code base, and you have
  developers working on local copies which contain only the files they have
  modified, one problem that comes up is: what if a developer wants to remove a
  file from his local build but the repository still contains it? If the
  developer removes the local copy, makepp will happily put in the copy from the
  repository, and the build will proceed as if the file existed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
One technique (alas not for user root) for this problem is to make the file that
  you want not to include in the build process unreadable, like this:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    chmod a-rw file-to-be-excluded
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This will prevent makepp from incorporating it from the repository. Makepp also
  includes special code so that unreadable files do not match wildcards or
  pattern rules.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Similarly, to prevent makepp from incorporating an entire subdirectory, make a
  local directory that has the same name but is unwritable. If you want makepp
  to ignore the directory entirely, then make it unreadable too. (Read-only
  directories are searched but targets in them are usually not built.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
The other way to do this is calling makepp with one or more exclusion options:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    mpp -R /path/to/rep --dont-read=/path/to/rep/file-to-be-excluded
</pre>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Don't_use_repositories_for_files_which_can_change!"><a class="selflink" href="#Don't_use_repositories_for_files_which_can_change!">Don't
  use repositories for files which can change!</a></h2>
Don't try to use a repository for a file which is part of your build. For
  example, you might be tempted to try to use repositories to put all of your
  public .h files in the same directory, like this:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    # top level makefile
    repository include=module1/include
    repository include=module2/include
    repository include=module3/include
    repository include=module4/include
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This is probably not a good idea if <i>any</i> of the <i>.h</i> files are
  themselves outputs of a program (e.g., yacc or some other program that spits
  out C source code), because makepp assumes that files in repositories never
  change. If the build needs <i>include/xyz.h</i>, and
  <i>module2/include/xyz.h</i> actually needs to be produced by some program,
  makepp will not know to run the program. It's better to use a technique like
  this to put all of your <i>.h</i> files into a common include directory:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    # module1/Makeppfile
    ../include/%.h : include/%.h
        &amp;cp $(input) $(output)
    # You could also (more efficiently but problematic on Windows) do the following:
    #    &amp;ln -r $(input) $(output)
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Makepp might still try to build files that happen to be in a repository if
  something asks for them directly, but it won't build them <i>on behalf</i> of
  the local directory. The result of this can be quite confusing, because it can
  lead to a repository symbolic link being used while its repository target is
  out-of-date, but that target might get updated later in the build. You can
  prevent this from happening either by making sure that the repository is
  referred to <i>only</i> through the repository path, or by making sure that
  there is also a local rule for all the generated repository files.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Another way to avoid recompiling identical files in different directories is to
  use a build cache (see makepp_build_cache for details). A build cache does not
  have the restriction that the file may not change.</div>
