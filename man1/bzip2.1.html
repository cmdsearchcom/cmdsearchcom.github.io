<p>bzip2(1) General Commands Manual bzip2(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
bzip2, bunzip2 - a block-sorting file compressor, v1.0.6
<br>
bzcat - decompresses files to stdout <br>
bzip2recover - recovers data from damaged bzip2 files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
bzip2 [ -cdfkqstvzVL123456789 ] [ filenames ... ] <br>
bunzip2 [ -fkvsVL ] [ filenames ... ] <br>
bzcat [ -s ] [ filenames ... ] <br>
bzip2recover filename</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
bzip2 compresses files using the Burrows-Wheeler block
sorting text compression algorithm, and Huffman coding.
Compression is generally considerably better than that
achieved by <br>
more conventional LZ77/LZ78-based compressors, and
approaches the performance of the PPM family of statistical
compressors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The command-line options are
deliberately very similar to those of GNU gzip, but they are
not identical.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bzip2 expects a list of file
names to accompany the command-line flags. Each file is
replaced by a compressed version of itself, with the name
&quot;original_name.bz2&quot;. Each com&acirc; <br>
pressed file has the same modification date, permissions,
and, when possible, ownership as the corresponding original,
so that these properties can be correctly restored at <br>
decompression time. File name handling is naive in the sense
that there is no mechanism for preserving original file
names, permissions, ownerships or dates in filesystems which
<br>
lack these concepts, or have serious file name length
restrictions, such as MS-DOS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bzip2 and bunzip2 will by
default not overwrite existing files. If you want this to
happen, specify the -f flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no file names are specified,
bzip2 compresses from standard input to standard output. In
this case, bzip2 will decline to write compressed output to
a terminal, as this would <br>
be entirely incomprehensible and therefore pointless.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bunzip2 (or bzip2 -d)
decompresses all specified files. Files which were not
created by bzip2 will be detected and ignored, and a warning
issued. bzip2 attempts to guess the <br>
filename for the decompressed file from that of the
compressed file as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">filename.bz2 becomes filename
<br>
filename.bz becomes filename <br>
filename.tbz2 becomes filename.tar <br>
filename.tbz becomes filename.tar <br>
anyothername becomes anyothername.out</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the file does not end in one
of the recognised endings, .bz2, .bz, .tbz2 or .tbz, bzip2
complains that it cannot guess the name of the original
file, and uses the original <br>
name with .out appended.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As with compression, supplying
no filenames causes decompression from standard input to
standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bunzip2 will correctly
decompress a file which is the concatenation of two or more
compressed files. The result is the concatenation of the
corresponding uncompressed files. <br>
Integrity testing (-t) of concatenated compressed files is
also supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also compress or
decompress files to the standard output by giving the -c
flag. Multiple files may be compressed and decompressed like
this. The resulting outputs are <br>
fed sequentially to stdout. Compression of multiple files in
this manner generates a stream containing multiple
compressed file representations. Such a stream can be
decom&acirc; <br>
pressed correctly only by bzip2 version 0.9.0 or later.
Earlier versions of bzip2 will stop after decompressing the
first file in the stream.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bzcat (or bzip2 -dc)
decompresses all specified files to the standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bzip2 will read arguments from
the environment variables BZIP2 and BZIP, in that order, and
will process them before any arguments read from the command
line. This gives a con&acirc; <br>
venient way to supply default arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Compression is always performed,
even if the compressed file is slightly larger than the
original. Files of less than about one hundred bytes tend to
get larger, since the com&acirc; <br>
pression mechanism has a constant overhead in the region of
50 bytes. Random data (including the output of most file
compressors) is coded at about 8.05 bits per byte, giving an
<br>
expansion of around 0.5%.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As a self-check for your
protection, bzip2 uses 32-bit CRCs to make sure that the
decompressed version of a file is identical to the original.
This guards against corruption of <br>
the compressed data, and against undetected bugs in bzip2
(hopefully very unlikely). The chances of data corruption
going undetected is microscopic, about one chance in four
<br>
billion for each file processed. Be aware, though, that the
check occurs upon decompression, so it can only tell you
that something is wrong. It can&rsquo;t help you recover the
<br>
original uncompressed data. You can use bzip2recover to try
to recover data from damaged files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Return values: 0 for a normal
exit, 1 for environmental problems (file not found, invalid
flags, I/O errors, &amp;c), 2 to indicate a corrupt
compressed file, 3 for an internal con&acirc; <br>
sistency error (eg, bug) which caused bzip2 to panic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-c --stdout <br>
Compress or decompress to standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d --decompress <br>
Force decompression. bzip2, bunzip2 and bzcat are really the
same program, and the decision about what actions to take is
done on the basis of which name is used. This <br>
flag overrides that mechanism, and forces bzip2 to
decompress.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z --compress <br>
The complement to -d: forces compression, regardless of the
invocation name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t --test <br>
Check integrity of the specified file(s), but don&rsquo;t
decompress them. This really performs a trial decompression
and throws away the result.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f --force <br>
Force overwrite of output files. Normally, bzip2 will not
overwrite existing output files. Also forces bzip2 to break
hard links to files, which it otherwise wouldn&rsquo;t <br>
do.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bzip2 normally declines to
decompress files which don&rsquo;t have the correct magic
header bytes. If forced (-f), however, it will pass such
files through unmodified. This is <br>
how GNU gzip behaves.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k --keep <br>
Keep (don&rsquo;t delete) input files during compression or
decompression.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s --small <br>
Reduce memory usage, for compression, decompression and
testing. Files are decompressed and tested using a modified
algorithm which only requires 2.5 bytes per block <br>
byte. This means any file can be decompressed in 2300k of
memory, albeit at about half the normal speed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">During compression, -s selects a
block size of 200k, which limits memory use to around the
same figure, at the expense of your compression ratio. In
short, if your <br>
machine is low on memory (8 megabytes or less), use -s for
everything. See MEMORY MANAGEMENT below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q --quiet <br>
Suppress non-essential warning messages. Messages pertaining
to I/O errors and other critical events will not be
suppressed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v --verbose <br>
Verbose mode -- show the compression ratio for each file
processed. Further -v&rsquo;s increase the verbosity level,
spewing out lots of information which is primarily of <br>
interest for diagnostic purposes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L --license -V --version <br>
Display the software version, license terms and
conditions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-1 (or --fast) to -9 (or --best)
<br>
Set the block size to 100 k, 200 k .. 900 k when
compressing. Has no effect when decompressing. See MEMORY
MANAGEMENT below. The --fast and --best aliases are
primar&acirc; <br>
ily for GNU gzip compatibility. In particular, --fast
doesn&rsquo;t make things significantly faster. And --best
merely selects the default behaviour.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-- Treats all subsequent
arguments as file names, even if they start with a dash.
This is so you can handle files with names beginning with a
dash, for example: bzip2 -- <br>
-myfilename.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--repetitive-fast
--repetitive-best <br>
These flags are redundant in versions 0.9.5 and above. They
provided some coarse control over the behaviour of the
sorting algorithm in earlier versions, which was some&acirc;
<br>
times useful. 0.9.5 and above have an improved algorithm
which renders these flags irrelevant.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MEMORY MANAGEMENT <br>
bzip2 compresses large files in blocks. The block size
affects both the compression ratio achieved, and the amount
of memory needed for compression and decompression. The
flags <br>
-1 through -9 specify the block size to be 100,000 bytes
through 900,000 bytes (the default) respectively. At
decompression time, the block size used for compression is
read <br>
from the header of the compressed file, and bunzip2 then
allocates itself just enough memory to decompress the file.
Since block sizes are stored in compressed files, it follows
<br>
that the flags -1 to -9 are irrelevant to and so ignored
during decompression.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Compression and decompression
requirements, in bytes, can be estimated as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Compression: 400k + ( 8 x block
size )</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Decompression: 100k + ( 4 x
block size ), or <br>
100k + ( 2.5 x block size )</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Larger block sizes give rapidly
diminishing marginal returns. Most of the compression comes
from the first two or three hundred k of block size, a fact
worth bearing in mind <br>
when using bzip2 on small machines. It is also important to
appreciate that the decompression memory requirement is set
at compression time by the choice of block size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For files compressed with the
default 900k block size, bunzip2 will require about 3700
kbytes to decompress. To support decompression of any file
on a 4 megabyte machine, bun&acirc; <br>
zip2 has an option to decompress using approximately half
this amount of memory, about 2300 kbytes. Decompression
speed is also halved, so you should use this option only
where <br>
necessary. The relevant flag is -s.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In general, try and use the
largest block size memory constraints allow, since that
maximises the compression achieved. Compression and
decompression speed are virtually unaf&acirc; <br>
fected by block size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another significant point
applies to files which fit in a single block -- that means
most files you&rsquo;d encounter using a large block size.
The amount of real memory touched is <br>
proportional to the size of the file, since the file is
smaller than a block. For example, compressing a file 20,000
bytes long with the flag -9 will cause the compressor to
<br>
allocate around 7600k of memory, but only touch 400k + 20000
* 8 = 560 kbytes of it. Similarly, the decompressor will
allocate 3700k but only touch 100k + 20000 * 4 = 180 <br>
kbytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here is a table which summarises
the maximum memory usage for different block sizes. Also
recorded is the total compressed size for 14 files of the
Calgary Text Compression Cor&acirc; <br>
pus totalling 3,141,622 bytes. This column gives some feel
for how compression varies with block size. These figures
tend to understate the advantage of larger block sizes for
<br>
larger files, since the Corpus is dominated by smaller
files.</p>

-9 7600k 3700k 2350k 828642</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RECOVERING DATA FROM DAMAGED
FILES <br>
bzip2 compresses files in blocks, usually 900kbytes long.
Each block is handled independently. If a media or
transmission error causes a multi-block .bz2 file to become
dam&acirc; <br>
aged, it may be possible to recover data from the undamaged
blocks in the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The compressed representation of
each block is delimited by a 48-bit pattern, which makes it
possible to find the block boundaries with reasonable
certainty. Each block also <br>
carries its own 32-bit CRC, so damaged blocks can be
distinguished from undamaged ones.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bzip2recover is a simple program
whose purpose is to search for blocks in .bz2 files, and
write each block out into its own .bz2 file. You can then
use bzip2 -t to test the <br>
integrity of the resulting files, and decompress those which
are undamaged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bzip2recover takes a single
argument, the name of the damaged file, and writes a number
of files &quot;rec00001file.bz2&quot;,
&quot;rec00002file.bz2&quot;, etc, containing the extracted
blocks. <br>
The output filenames are designed so that the use of
wildcards in subsequent processing -- for example,
&quot;bzip2 -dc rec*file.bz2 &gt; recovered_data&quot; --
processes the files in <br>
the correct order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bzip2recover should be of most
use dealing with large .bz2 files, as these will contain
many blocks. It is clearly futile to use it on damaged
single-block files, since a <br>
damaged block cannot be recovered. If you wish to minimise
any potential data loss through media or transmission
errors, you might consider compressing with a smaller block
<br>
size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PERFORMANCE NOTES <br>
The sorting phase of compression gathers together similar
strings in the file. Because of this, files containing very
long runs of repeated symbols, like &quot;aabaabaabaab
...&quot; <br>
(repeated several hundred times) may compress more slowly
than normal. Versions 0.9.5 and above fare much better than
previous versions in this respect. The ratio between <br>
worst-case and average-case compression time is in the
region of 10:1. For previous versions, this figure was more
like 100:1. You can use the -vvvv option to monitor progress
<br>
in great detail, if you want.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Decompression speed is
unaffected by these phenomena.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bzip2 usually allocates several
megabytes of memory to operate in, and then charges all over
it in a fairly random fashion. This means that performance,
both for compressing and <br>
decompressing, is largely determined by the speed at which
your machine can service cache misses. Because of this,
small changes to the code to reduce the miss rate have been
<br>
observed to give disproportionately large performance
improvements. I imagine bzip2 will perform best on machines
with very large caches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CAVEATS <br>
I/O error messages are not as helpful as they could be.
bzip2 tries hard to detect I/O errors and exit cleanly, but
the details of what the problem is sometimes seem rather
mis&acirc; <br>
leading.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This manual page pertains to
version 1.0.6 of bzip2. Compressed data created by this
version is entirely forwards and backwards compatible with
the previous public releases, <br>
versions 0.1pl2, 0.9.0, 0.9.5, 1.0.0, 1.0.1, 1.0.2 and
above, but with the following exception: 0.9.0 and above can
correctly decompress multiple concatenated compressed files.
<br>
0.1pl2 cannot do this; it will stop after decompressing just
the first file in the stream.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bzip2recover versions prior to
1.0.2 used 32-bit integers to represent bit positions in
compressed files, so they could not handle compressed files
more than 512 megabytes long. <br>
Versions 1.0.2 and above use 64-bit ints on some platforms
which support them (GNU supported targets, and Windows). To
establish whether or not bzip2recover was built with such
<br>
a limitation, run it without arguments. In any event you can
build yourself an unlimited version if you can recompile it
with MaybeUInt64 set to be an unsigned 64-bit integer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ideas embodied in bzip2 are
due to (at least) the following people: Michael Burrows and
David Wheeler (for the block sorting transformation), David
Wheeler (again, for the <br>
Huffman coder), Peter Fenwick (for the structured coding
model in the original bzip, and many refinements), and
Alistair Moffat, Radford Neal and Ian Witten (for the
arithmetic <br>
coder in the original bzip). I am much indebted for their
help, support and advice. See the manual in the source
distribution for pointers to sources of documentation.
Chris&acirc; <br>
tian von Roques encouraged me to look for faster sorting
algorithms, so as to speed up compression. Bela Lubkin
encouraged me to improve the worst-case compression
performance. <br>
Donna Robinson XMLised the documentation. The bz* scripts
are derived from those of GNU gzip. Many people sent
patches, helped with portability problems, lent machines,
gave <br>
advice and were generally helpful.</p>
