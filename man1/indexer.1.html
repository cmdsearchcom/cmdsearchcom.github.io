--quiet] [--all | INDEX | ...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">indexer --buildstops OUTPUTFILE

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Sphinx is a collection of programs that aim to provide high
quality fulltext search.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">indexer is the first of the two
principle tools as part of Sphinx. Invoked from either the
command line directly, or as part of a larger script,
indexer is solely responsible for <br>
gathering the data that will be searchable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The calling syntax for indexer
is as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ indexer [OPTIONS] [indexname1
[indexname2 [...]]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Essentially you would list the
different possible indexes (that you would later make
available to search) in sphinx.conf, so when calling
indexer, as a minimum you need to be <br>
telling it what index (or indexes) you want to index.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If sphinx.conf contained details
on 2 indexes, mybigindex and mysmallindex, you could do the
following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ indexer mybigindex <br>
$ indexer mysmallindex mybigindex</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As part of the configuration
file, sphinx.conf, you specify one or more indexes for your
data. You might call indexer to reindex one of them, ad-hoc,
or you can tell it to <br>
process all indexes - you are not limited to calling just
one, or all at once, you can always pick some combination of
the available indexes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The majority of the options for indexer are given in the
configuration file, however there are some options you might
need to specify on the command line as well, as they can
<br>
affect how the indexing operation is performed. These
options are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--all <br>
Tells indexer to update every index listed in sphinx.conf,
instead of listing individual indexes. This would be useful
in small configurations, or cron-type or maintenance <br>
jobs where the entire index set will get rebuilt each day,
or week, or whatever period is best.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example usage:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ indexer --config
/home/myuser/sphinx.conf --all</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--buildstops outfile.txt NUM
<br>
Reviews the index source, as if it were indexing the data,
and produces a list of the terms that are being indexed. In
other words, it produces a list of all the searchable <br>
terms that are becoming part of the index. Note; it does not
update the index in question, it simply processes the data
&rsquo;as if&rsquo; it were indexing, including running
queries <br>
defined with sql_query_pre or sql_query_post. outputfile.txt
will contain the list of words, one per line, sorted by
frequency with most frequent first, and NUM specifies <br>
the maximum number of words that will be listed; if
sufficiently large to encompass every word in the index,
only that many words will be returned. Such a dictionary
list <br>
could be used for client application features around
&quot;Did you mean...&quot; functionality, usually in
conjunction with --buildfreqs, below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ indexer myindex --buildstops
word_freq.txt 1000</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This would produce a document in
the current directory, word_freq.txt with the 1,000 most
common words in &rsquo;myindex&rsquo;, ordered by most
common first. Note that the file will <br>
pertain to the last index indexed when specified with
multiple indexes or --all (i.e. the last one listed in the
configuration file)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--buildfreqs <br>
Used in pair with --buildstops (and is ignored if
--buildstops is not specified). As --buildstops provides the
list of words used within the index, --buildfreqs adds the
<br>
quantity present in the index, which would be useful in
establishing whether certain words should be considered
stopwords if they are too prevalent. It will also help with
<br>
developing &quot;Did you mean...&quot; features where you
can how much more common a given word compared to another,
similar one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ indexer myindex --buildstops
word_freq.txt 1000 --buildfreqs</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This would produce the
word_freq.txt as above, however after each word would be the
number of times it occurred in the index in question.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--config CONFIGRILE, -c
CONFIGFILE <br>
Use the given file as configuration. Normally, it will look
for sphinx.conf in the installation directory
(e.g./usr/local/sphinx/etc/sphinx.conf if installed into
<br>
/usr/local/sphinx), followed by the current directory you
are in when calling indexer from the shell. This is most of
use in shared environments where the binary files are <br>
installed somewhere like /usr/local/sphinx/ but you want to
provide users with the ability to make their own custom
Sphinx set-ups, or if you want to run multiple instances
<br>
on a single server. In cases like those you could allow them
to create their own sphinx.conf files and pass them to
indexer with this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ indexer --config
/home/myuser/sphinx.conf myindex</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dump-rows FILE <br>
Dumps rows fetched by SQL source(s) into the specified file,
in a MySQL compatible syntax. Resulting dumps are the exact
representation of data as received by indexer and <br>
help to repeat indexing-time issues.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--merge DST-INDEX SRC-INDEX <br>
Physically merge together two indexes. For example if you
have a main+delta scheme, where the main index rarely
changes, but the delta index is rebuilt frequently, and <br>
--merge would be used to combine the two. The operation
moves from right to left - the contents of SRC-INDEX get
examined and physically combined with the contents of <br>
DST-INDEX and the result is left in DST-INDEX. In
pseudo-code, it might be expressed as: DST-INDEX +=
SRC-INDEX</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ indexer --merge main delta
--rotate</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the above example, where the
main is the master, rarely modified index, and delta is the
less frequently modified one, you might use the above to
call indexer to combine <br>
the contents of the delta into the main index and rotate the
indexes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--merge-dst-range ATTR MIN MAX
<br>
Run the filter range given upon merging. Specifically, as
the merge is applied to the destination index (as part of
--merge, and is ignored if --merge is not specified), <br>
indexer will also filter the documents ending up in the
destination index, and only documents will pass through the
filter given will end up in the final index. This could be
<br>
used for example, in an index where there is a
&rsquo;deleted&rsquo; attribute, where 0 means &rsquo;not
deleted&rsquo;. Such an index could be merged with:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ indexer --merge main delta
--merge-dst-range deleted 0 0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any documents marked as deleted
(value 1) would be removed from the newly-merged destination
index. It can be added several times to the command line, to
add successive <br>
filters to the merge, all of which must be met in order for
a document to become part of the final index.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--merge-killlists,
--merge-klists <br>
Used in pair with --merge. Usually when merging indexer uses
kill-list of source index (i.e., the one which is merged
into) as the filter to wipe out the matching docs from <br>
the destination index. At the same time the kill-list of the
destination itself isn&rsquo;t touched at all. When using
--merge-killlists, (or it shorter form --merge-klists) the
<br>
indexer will not filter the dst-index docs with src-index
killlist, but it will merge their kill-lists together, so
the final result index will have the kill-list containing
<br>
the merged source kill-lists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--noprogress <br>
Don&rsquo;t display progress details as they occur; instead,
the final status details (such as documents indexed, speed
of indexing and so on are only reported at completion of
<br>
indexing. In instances where the script is not being run on
a console (or &rsquo;tty&rsquo;), this will be on by
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example usage:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ indexer --rotate --all
--noprogress</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--print-queries <br>
Prints out SQL queries that indexer sends to the database,
along with SQL connection and disconnection events. That is
useful to diagnose and fix problems with SQL sources.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--quiet <br>
Tells indexer not to output anything, unless there is an
error. Again, most used for cron-type, or other script jobs
where the output is irrelevant or unnecessary, except in
<br>
the event of some kind of error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example usage:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ indexer --rotate --all
--quiet</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--rotate <br>
Used for rotating indexes. Unless you have the situation
where you can take the search function offline without
troubling users, you will almost certainly need to keep
search <br>
running whilst indexing new documents. --rotate creates a
second index, parallel to the first (in the same place,
simply including .new in the filenames). Once complete, <br>
indexer notifies searchd via sending the SIGHUP signal, and
searchd will attempt to rename the indexes (renaming the
existing ones to include .old and renaming the .new to <br>
replace them), and then start serving from the newer files.
Depending on the setting of seamless_rotate, there may be a
slight delay in being able to search the newer <br>
indexes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example usage:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ indexer --rotate --all</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--sighup-each <br>
is useful when you are rebuilding many big indexes, and want
each one rotated into searchd as soon as possible. With
--sighup-each, indexer will send a SIGHUP signal to <br>
searchd after succesfully completing the work on each index.
(The default behavior is to send a single SIGHUP after all
the indexes were built.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--verbose <br>
Guarantees that every row that caused problems indexing
(duplicate, zero, or missing document ID; or file field IO
issues; etc) will be reported. By default, this option is
<br>
off, and problem summaries may be reported instead.</p>
