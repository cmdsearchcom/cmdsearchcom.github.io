<p>orbd(1) General Commands Manual orbd(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
orbd - The Object Request Broker Daemon</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">orbd is used to enable clients
to transparently locate and invoke persistent objects on
servers in the CORBA environment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See also: Naming Service</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
orbd &lt;options&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The Server Manager included with the orbd tool is used to
enable clients to transparently locate and invoke persistent
objects on servers in the CORBA environment. The persistent
<br>
servers, while publishing the persistent object references
in the Naming Service, include the port number of the ORBD
in the object reference instead of the port number of the
<br>
Server. The inclusion of an ORBD port number in the object
reference for persistent object references has the following
advantages:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o The object reference in the
Naming Service remains independent of the server life cycle.
For example, the object reference could be published by the
server in the Naming <br>
Service when it is first installed, and then, independent of
how many times the server is started or shutdown, the ORBD
will always return the correct object reference to <br>
the invoking client.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o The client needs to lookup the
object reference in the Naming Service only once, and can
keep re-using this reference independent of the changes
introduced due to server <br>
life cycle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To access ORBD&rsquo;s Server
Manager, the server must be started using servertool, which
is a command-line interface for application programmers to
register, unregister, startup, and <br>
shutdown a persistent server. For more information on the
Server Manager, see the section in this document titled
Server Manager.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When orbd starts up, it also
starts a naming service. For more information on the naming
service, link to Naming Service.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Required Options <br>
-ORBInitialPort nameserverport <br>
Specifies the port on which the name server should be
started. Once started, orbd will listen for incoming
requests on this port. Note that when using Solaris
software, you <br>
must become root to start a process on a port under 1024.
For this reason, we recommend that you use a port number
greater than or equal to 1024. (required)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OTHER OPTIONS <br>
-port port <br>
Specifies the activation port where ORBD should be started,
and where ORBD will be accepting requests for persistent
objects. The default value for this port is 1049. This <br>
port number is added to the port field of the persistent
Interoperable Object References (IOR). (optional)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-defaultdb directory <br>
Specifies the base where the ORBD persistent storage
directory orb.db is created. If this option is not
specified, the default value is &quot;./orb.db&quot;.
(optional)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-serverPollingTime milliseconds
<br>
Specifies how often ORBD checks for the health of persistent
servers registered via servertool. The default value is
1,000 ms. The value specified for milliseconds must be <br>
a valid positive integer. (optional)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-serverStartupDelay milliseconds
<br>
Specifies how long ORBD waits before sending a location
forward exception after a persistent server that is
registered via servertool is restarted. The default value is
<br>
1,000 ms. The value specified for milliseconds must be a
valid positive integer. (optional)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Joption <br>
Pass option to the Java virtual machine, where option is one
of the options described on the reference page for the java
application launcher. For example, -J-Xms48m sets <br>
the startup memory to 48 megabytes. It is a common
convention for -J to pass options to the underlying virtual
machine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Starting and Stopping the Naming
Service</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A Naming Service is a CORBA
service that allows CORBA objects to be named by means of
binding a name to an object reference. The name binding may
be stored in the naming service, <br>
and a client may supply the name to obtain the desired
object reference.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Prior to running a client or a
server, you will start ORBD. ORBD includes a persistent
Naming Service and a transient Naming Service, both of which
are an implementation of the <br>
COS Naming Service.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Persistent Naming Service
provides persistence for naming contexts. This means that
this information is persistent across service shutdowns and
startups, and is recoverable <br>
in the event of a service failure. If ORBD is restarted, the
Persistent Naming Service will restore the naming context
graph, so that the binding of all clients&rsquo; and
servers&rsquo; <br>
names remains intact (persistent).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For backward compatibility,
tnameserv, a Transient Naming Service shipped with older
versions of the JDK, is also included in this release of
J2SE. A transient naming service <br>
retains naming contexts as long as it is running. If there
is a service interruption, the naming context graph is
lost.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -ORBInitialPort argument is
a required command-line argument for orbd, and is used to
set the port number on which the Naming Service will run.
The following instructions <br>
assume you can use port 1050 for the Java IDL Object Request
Broker Daemon. When using Solaris software, you must become
root to start a process on a port under 1024. For this <br>
reason, we recommend that you use a port number greater than
or equal to 1024. You can substitute a different port if
necessary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To start orbd from a UNIX
command shell, enter:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">orbd -ORBInitialPort
1050&amp;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">From an MS-DOS system prompt
(Windows), enter:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">start orbd -ORBInitialPort
1050</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Now that ORBD is running, you
can run your server and client applications. When running
the client and server applications, they must be made aware
of the port number (and <br>
machine name, if applicable) where the Naming Service is
running. One way to do this is to add the following code to
your application:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Properties props = new
Properties(); <br>
props.put(&quot;org.omg.CORBA.ORBInitialPort&quot;,
&quot;1050&quot;); <br>
props.put(&quot;org.omg.CORBA.ORBInitialHost&quot;,
&quot;MyHost&quot;); <br>
ORB orb = ORB.init(args, props);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In this example, the Naming
Service is running on port 1050 on host &quot;MyHost&quot;.
Another way is to specify the port number and/or machine
name when running the server or client <br>
application from the command line. For example, you would
start your &quot;HelloApplication&quot; with the following
command line:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">java HelloApplication
-ORBInitialPort 1050 -ORBInitialHost MyHost</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To stop the naming service, use
the relevant operating system command, such as pkill orbd on
Solaris, or Ctrl+C in the DOS window in which orbd is
running. Note that names regis&acirc; <br>
tered with the naming service may disappear when the service
is terminated if the naming service is transient. The Java
IDL naming service will run until it is explicitly <br>
stopped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For more information on the
Naming Service included with ORBD, see Naming Service.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Server Manager <br>
To access ORBD&rsquo;s Server Manager and run a persistent
server, the server must be started using servertool, which
is a command-line interface for application programmers to
regis&acirc; <br>
ter, unregister, startup, and shutdown a persistent server.
When a server is started using servertool, it must be
started on the same host and port on which orbd is
executing. If <br>
the server is run on a different port, the information
stored in the database for local contexts will be invalid
and the service will not work properly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Server Manager: an Example <br>
Using the sample tutorial for our demonstration, you would
run the idlj compiler and javac compiler as shown in the
tutorial. To run the Server Manager, follow these steps for
<br>
running the application:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Start orbd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To start orbd from a UNIX
command shell, enter:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">orbd -ORBInitialPort 1050</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">From an MS-DOS system prompt
(Windows), enter:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">start orbd -ORBInitialPort
1050</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that 1050 is the port on
which you want the name server to run. -ORBInitialPort is a
required command-line argument. When using Solaris software,
you must become root to <br>
start a process on a port under 1024. For this reason, we
recommend that you use a port number greater than or equal
to 1024.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Start the servertool:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To start the Hello server,
enter:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">servertool -ORBInitialPort
1050</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Make sure the name server (orbd)
port is the same as in the previous step, for example,
-ORBInitialPort 1050. The servertool must be started on the
same port as the name server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The servertool command line
interface appears.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Start the Hello server from the
servertool prompt:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">servertool &gt; register -server
HelloServer -classpath . -applicationName <br>
HelloServerApName</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The servertool registers the
server, assigns it the name of
&quot;HelloServerApName&quot;, and displays its server id,
along with a listing of all registered servers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Run the client application from
another terminal window or prompt:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">java HelloClient -ORBInitialPort
1050 -ORBInitialHost localhost</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For this example, you can omit
-ORBInitialHost localhost since the name server is running
on the same host as the Hello client. If the name server is
running on a different host, <br>
use -ORBInitialHost nameserverhost to specify the host on
which the IDL name server is running.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specify the name server (orbd)
port as done in the previous step, for example,
-ORBInitialPort 1050.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When you have finished
experimenting with the Server Manager, be sure to shut down
or kill the name server (orbd) and servertool.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To shut down orbd from a DOS
prompt, select the window that is running the server and
enter Ctrl+C to shut it down. To shut down orbdfrom a Unix
shell, find the process, and kill <br>
it. The server will continue to wait for invocations until
it is explicitly stopped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To shut down the servertool,
type quit and press the Enter key on the keyboard.</p>
