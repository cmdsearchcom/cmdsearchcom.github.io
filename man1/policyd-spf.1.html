Manual POLICYD-SPF(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
policyd-spf - pure-Python Postfix policy daemon for SPF
checking</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VERSION <br>
2.0.0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USAGE <br>
NOTE: Depending on the packaging and distribution, the exact
path to the executable may vary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ policyd-spf (Start using
installed config file)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ policyd-spf -h (Display usage
message)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ policyd-spf
/etc/policyd-spf/policyd-spf.conf (Config file name to
use)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Configuration options are
described in the sample configuration file provided with the
package (policyd-spf.conf.commented) and in
policyd-spf.conf(5). The provided setup.py <br>
installs an uncommented configuration file in
/etc/policyd-spf/.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Additionally, whitelisting
certain IP addresses or IP addresses used by listed domains
from SPF checks is supported. Skipping SPF checks for local
submission or trusted relays <br>
is also provided. The sample configuration file and
policyd-spf.conf(5) shows the format to use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OTHER DOCUMENTATION <br>
This documentation assumes you have read Postfix&rsquo;s
README_FILES/ SMTPD_POLICY_README and are generally familiar
with Sender Policy Framework (SPF). See RFC 7208 for
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See man 5 policyd-spf.conf for
configuration file information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">man 5 policyd-spf.peruser
provides documentation on setting up and using different
configuration options on a per user (mail reciepient)
basis.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
python-policyd-spf is a Postfix SMTPd policy daemon for SPF
checking. It is implemented in pure Python and uses the
pyspf module. The SPF web site is http://www.openspf.org/.
<br>
The Postfix configuration must be changed to check SPF.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Logging is sent to syslogd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each time a Postfix SMTP server
process is started it connects to the policy service socket
and Postfix runs one instance of this Python script. By
default, a Postfix SMTP <br>
server process terminates after 100 seconds of idle time, or
after serving 100 clients. Thus, the cost of starting this
Python script is smoothed over time</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default policy_time_limit is
1000 seconds. This may be too short for some SMTP
transactions to complete. As recommended in
SMTPD_POLICY_README, this should be extended to <br>
3600 seconds. To do so, set &quot;policy_time_limit =
3600&quot; in /etc/postfix/main.cf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Messages that get a Fail SPF
result will be rejected. Messages that get a Permerror are,
by default, treated as if they had no SPF record. Messages
that get a Temperror result <br>
are, by default, treated as if they had no SPF record, but
can (and probably should) be deferred if otherwise
permitted. Messages that get other SPF results (Pass, None,
Neu&acirc; <br>
tral, Softfail) will have the SPF Received header prepended.
Note: Spamasassisn 3.2 and follow will use this header for
spam scoring so there is no need to configure a separate
<br>
SPF check in these Spamassassin versions. See Spamassassin
documentation for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default Mail From
rejection/deferal criteria are, by design, conservative.
Default HELO check actions are to reject mail with other
than Pass/None. HELO records are much simpler <br>
than Mail From records and rejecting based on HELO checking
does not present a false positive risk. These settings are a
matter of local policy and should be adjusted to meet <br>
the requirements of site administrators. See
policyd-spf.conf(5) for configuration file details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LOGGING <br>
Policyd-spf will log messages to syslog about it&rsquo;s
activities. The &quot;debugLevel&quot; value in
&quot;policyd-spf.conf&quot; can be increased to get
additional information to be logged. When <br>
set to a value of &quot;0&quot;, only test results (SPF
hits/misses) are logged. Results will be returned to Postfix
and logged as a warning by Postfix also. For logging by this
policy <br>
server, look for &quot;policyd-spf&quot; in your mail log
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TESTING THE POLICY DAEMON <br>
Testing the policy daemon</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To test the policy daemon by
hand, execute:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">policyd-spf</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each query is a bunch of
attributes. Order does not matter, and the daemon uses only
a few of all the attributes shown below:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">request=smtpd_access_policy <br>
protocol_state=RCPT <br>
protocol_name=SMTP <br>
helo_name=some.domain.tld <br>
queue_id=8045F2AB23 <br>
instance=12345.6789 <br>
sender=foo@bar.tld <br>
recipient=bar@foo.tld <br>
client_address=1.2.3.4 <br>
client_name=another.domain.tld <br>
[empty line]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The policy daemon will answer in
the same style, with an attribute list followed by a empty
line:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">action=dunno <br>
[empty line]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">POSTFIX INTEGRATION <br>
1. Add the following to /etc/postfix/master.cf:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">policyd-spf unix - n n - 0 spawn
<br>
user=nobody argv=/usr/bin/policyd-spf</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: Check the path to both the
installed Python 3 interpreter and <br>
policyd-spf. These vary from system to system. To use
non-default <br>
settings, you must also add the config file (see above and
<br>
policyd-spf.conf(5) for details). If you run other services
with <br>
user nobody, create a dedicated user for this policy server
and use <br>
that instead. Python and Python 3 versions prior to 3.3 are
not <br>
supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Configure the Postfix policy
service in /etc/postfix/main.cf:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">smtpd_recipient_restrictions =
<br>
... <br>
reject_unauth_destination <br>
check_policy_service unix:private/policyd-spf <br>
... <br>
policyd-spf_time_limit = 3600</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: Specify
check_policy_service AFTER reject_unauth_destination or <br>
else your system can become an open relay.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. Reload Postfix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS <br>
The time to complete DNS lookups associated with SPF checks
is the most significant factor in policy server performance.
Use of a capable local caching resolver is highly
recom&acirc; <br>
mended. Specifics of resolver setup are outside the scope of
this document.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Long waits for DNS answers can
cause performance bottlenecks. There are two primary
controls, policyd-spf.conf(5) has details, provided to
affect DNS timing. Lookup_Time con&acirc; <br>
trols the overall time, in seconds, allowed for an SPF check
to complete. Whitelist_Lookup_Time controls the amount of
time allowed for individual DNS lookups associated with <br>
name based whitelist options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Lookup_Time defaults to the 20
second value recommended by RFC 7208. This is a conservative
recommendation and often a lower limit works quite well.
Delays associated with <br>
whitelisting related DNS lookups can be avoided by using IP
based options instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A shorter time increases the
likelihood that the result for some messages will be a
temporary error rather then the actual correct result. To
avoid some reported interoperabil&acirc; <br>
ity issues with some greylisting implementations,
TempError_Defer defaults to False. With TempError_Defer set
to True, such TempError messages will be deferred and when
retried, <br>
the responses should be in the local DNS resolver&rsquo;s
cache.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The combination of a low
Lookup_Time setting, TempError_Defer = True, and no DNS name
based whitelisting will maximize SPF checking throughput
with only mimimal delays. Consider <br>
a value of Lookup_Time = 5 seconds and monitor the system
mail logs. If TempError results are rare or non-existent,
the value can be lowered. If such result are common (more
<br>
than 1% of mail), then the value should be raised.</p>
