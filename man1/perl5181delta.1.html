<p>PERL5181DELTA(1) Perl Programmers Reference Guide
PERL5181DELTA(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
perl5181delta - what is new for perl v5.18.1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This document describes differences between the 5.18.0
release and the 5.18.1 release.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are upgrading from an
earlier release such as 5.16.0, first read perl5180delta,
which describes differences between 5.16.0 and 5.18.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Incompatible Changes <br>
There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.18.0
If any exist, they are bugs, and we request that you submit
a report. See &quot;Reporting Bugs&quot; below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Modules and Pragmata <br>
Updated Modules and Pragmata <br>
&Acirc;&middot; B has been upgraded from 1.42 to 1.42_01,
fixing bugs related to lexical subroutines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Digest::SHA has
been upgraded from 5.84 to 5.84_01, fixing a crashing bug.
[RT #118649]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Module::CoreList
has been upgraded from 2.89 to 2.96.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Platform Support <br>
Platform-Specific Notes <br>
AIX A rarely-encounted configuration bug in the AIX hints
file has been corrected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MidnightBSD <br>
After a patch to the relevant hints file, perl should now
build correctly on MidnightBSD 0.4-RELEASE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Selected Bug Fixes <br>
&Acirc;&middot; Starting in v5.18.0, a construct like
&quot;/[#](?{})/x&quot; would have its &quot;#&quot;
incorrectly interpreted as a comment. The code block would
be skipped, unparsed. This has been <br>
corrected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A number of
memory leaks related to the new, experimental regexp
bracketed character class feature have been plugged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The OP
allocation code now returns correctly aligned memory in all
cases for &quot;struct pmop&quot;. Previously it could
return memory only aligned to a 4-byte boundary, which is
not <br>
correct for an ithreads build with 64 bit IVs on some 32 bit
platforms. Notably, this caused the build to fail completely
on sparc GNU/Linux. [RT #118055]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The
debugger&rsquo;s &quot;man&quot; command been fixed. It was
broken in the v5.18.0 release. The &quot;man&quot; command
is aliased to the names &quot;doc&quot; and
&quot;perldoc&quot; - all now work again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; @_ is now
correctly visible in the debugger, fixing a regression
introduced in v5.18.0&rsquo;s debugger. [RT #118169]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Fixed a small
number of regexp constructions that could either fail to
match or crash perl when the string being matched against
was allocated above the 2GB line on 32-bit <br>
systems. [RT #118175]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Perl v5.16
inadvertently introduced a bug whereby calls to XSUBs that
were not visible at compile time were treated as lvalues and
could be assigned to, even when the <br>
subroutine was not an lvalue sub. This has been fixed. [perl
#117947]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Perl v5.18
inadvertently introduced a bug whereby dual-vars (i.e.
variables with both string and numeric values, such as $! )
where the truthness of the variable was <br>
determined by the numeric value rather than the string
value. [RT #118159]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Perl v5.18
inadvertently introduced a bug whereby interpolating mixed
up- and down-graded UTF-8 strings in a regex could result in
malformed UTF-8 in the pattern: <br>
specifically if a downgraded character in the range
&quot;0..&quot; followed a UTF-8 string, e.g.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">utf8::upgrade( my $u =
&quot;5}&quot;); <br>
utf8::downgrade(my $d = &quot;5}&quot;); <br>
/$u$d/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[perl #118297].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Lexical
constants (&quot;my sub a() { 42 }&quot;) no longer crash
when inlined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Parameter
prototypes attached to lexical subroutines are now respected
when compiling sub calls without parentheses. Previously,
the prototypes were honoured only for calls <br>
with parentheses. [RT #116735]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Syntax errors in
lexical subroutines in combination with calls to the same
subroutines no longer cause crashes at compile time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The dtrace
sub-entry probe now works with lexical subs, instead of
crashing [perl #118305].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Undefining an
inlinable lexical subroutine (&quot;my sub foo() { 42 }
undef &amp;foo&quot;) would result in a crash if warnings
were turned on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Deep recursion
warnings no longer crash lexical subroutines. [RT
#118521]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Acknowledgements <br>
Perl 5.18.1 represents approximately 2 months of development
since Perl 5.18.0 and contains approximately 8,400 lines of
changes across 60 files from 12 authors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl continues to flourish into
its third decade thanks to a vibrant community of users and
developers. The following people are known to have
contributed the improvements that <br>
became Perl 5.18.1:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Chris &rsquo;BinGOs&rsquo;
Williams, Craig A. Berry, Dagfinn Ilmari Mannsaaker, David
Mitchell, Father Chrysostomos, Karl Williamson, Lukas Mai,
Nicholas Clark, Peter Martini, Ricardo <br>
Signes, Shlomi Fish, Tony Cook.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The list above is almost
certainly incomplete as it is automatically generated from
version control history. In particular, it does not include
the names of the (very much <br>
appreciated) contributors who reported issues to the Perl
bug tracker.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Many of the changes included in
this version originated in the CPAN modules included in
Perl&rsquo;s core. We&rsquo;re grateful to the entire CPAN
community for helping Perl to flourish.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For a more complete list of all
of Perl&rsquo;s historical contributors, please see the
AUTHORS file in the Perl source distribution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Reporting Bugs <br>
If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the
articles recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc
newsgroup and the perl bug database at
http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/ . <br>
There may also be information at http://www.perl.org/ , the
Perl Home Page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you believe you have an
unreported bug, please run the perlbug program included with
your release. Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case. Your bug <br>
report, along with the output of &quot;perl -V&quot;, will
be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl
porting team.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the bug you are reporting has
security implications, which make it inappropriate to send
to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send it to
<br>
perl5-security-report@perl.org. This points to a closed
subscription unarchived mailing list, which includes all the
core committers, who will be able to help assess the impact
<br>
of issues, figure out a resolution, and help co-ordinate the
release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all
platforms on which Perl is supported. Please only use <br>
this address for security issues in the Perl core, not for
modules independently distributed on CPAN.</p>
