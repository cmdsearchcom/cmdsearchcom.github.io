<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Acknowledgements"><a class="selflink" href="#Acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</a></h1>
Perl 5.18.1 represents approximately 2 months of development since Perl 5.18.0
  and contains approximately 8,400 lines of changes across 60 files from 12
  authors.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Perl continues to flourish into its third decade thanks to a vibrant community
  of users and developers. The following people are known to have contributed
  the improvements that became Perl 5.18.1:
<div class="Pp"></div>
Chris 'BinGOs' Williams, Craig A. Berry, Dagfinn Ilmari Mannsaaker, David
  Mitchell, Father Chrysostomos, Karl Williamson, Lukas Mai, Nicholas Clark,
  Peter Martini, Ricardo Signes, Shlomi Fish, Tony Cook.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is automatically generated
  from version control history. In particular, it does not include the names of
  the (very much appreciated) contributors who reported issues to the Perl bug
  tracker.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Many of the changes included in this version originated in the CPAN modules
  included in Perl's core. We're grateful to the entire CPAN community for
  helping Perl to flourish.
<div class="Pp"></div>

  the <i>AUTHORS</i> file in the Perl source distribution.

  Bugs</a></h1>
If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently
  posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at
  http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/ . There may also be information at
  http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug program
  included with your release. Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
  sufficient test case. Your bug report, along with the output of &quot;perl
  -V&quot;, will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl
  porting team.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it
  inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send it
  to perl5-security-report@perl.org. This points to a closed subscription
  unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core committers, who will be
  able to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help
  co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all
  platforms on which Perl is supported. Please only use this address for
  security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently distributed on
  CPAN.
