<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
xduplic-copier - type into multiple X windows at once</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
xduplic-copier</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
xduplic-copier lets you type into multiple X windows at
once.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It has a very basic user
interface for selecting which windows to type into.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
xduplic-copier ignores its command-line arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MODES <br>
xduplic-copier puts up a small window with some text in it.
It has two modes:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Idle: &quot;i 0&quot; (red);
Typing &quot;T count&quot; (green) <br>
If you type keystrokes into xduplic-copier, they will be
replicated to all the selected windows (if there are any).
(You can also type into the selected windows individu&acirc;
<br>
ally in the normal way.) count is the number of selected
windows. The starting mode is Idle; you should left-click to
start selecting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Selecting: &quot;S count&quot;
(white) <br>
In this mode xduplic-copier has grabbed the mouse pointer
and you can indicate which windows you are going to want to
type into.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MOUSE ACTIONS <br>
Left-click in xduplic-copier <br>
Switch between typing and selecting modes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Right-click in xduplic-copier
<br>
Quit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Left-click in another window
while selecting <br>
Select this window. (Beeps if already selected.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Right-click in another window
while selecting <br>
Deselect this window. (Beeps if not selected.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Right-click in root window (ie,
desktop background) while selecting <br>
Deselect all windows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Q key while selecting <br>
Quits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">XTERM AND ALLOW SENDEVENTS <br>
xduplic-copier does its work by generating synthetic events
for the selected windows, using XSendEvent. Unfortunately
the xterm authors think that allowing XSendEvent is a
secu&acirc; <br>
rity problem; they are wrong: any untrusted person can
already take over your xterms anyway. But the xterm authors
have configured xterm to discard synthetic events by
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can solve this at runtime by
bringing up the ctrl-leftbutton menu in each xterm, and
ticking the option &quot;Allow SendEvents&quot;. Or you can
set the allowSendEvents in your xterm <br>
X resources.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Neither of these significantly
reduce your security. Indeed, xterm itself allows these
properties to be set via the X toolkit system&rsquo;s remote
widget property setting arrange&acirc; <br>
ments - so it would be possible for xduplic-copier to set
this property itself on any xterms it encountered.
Unfortunately doing so would be a lot of tedious
programming.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
If one of the windows you have selected is closed, and you
try typing, xduplic-copier will crash due to an unhandled
X11 error. If you notice that you have got into this state,
<br>
you cannot retain your set of selected windows because there
is no way to click on the now-destroyed window to deselect
it. You can keep xduplic-copier from crashing by right- <br>
clicking on the background in selecting mode, and then
reselecting all your windows, which may be marginally more
convenient than restarting it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The UI is perhaps excessively
sparse.</p>
