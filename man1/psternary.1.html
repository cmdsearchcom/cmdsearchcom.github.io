psternary - Plot data on ternary diagrams</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
psternary [ table ] [ -JX *width*[unit] ] [
-Rwest/east/south/north[/zmin/zmax][+r] ] [
-B[p|s]parameters ] [ -Ccpt ] [ -Gfill ] [ -K ] [ -La/b/c ]

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: No space is allowed
between the option flag and the associated arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
psternary reads (a,b,c[,*z*]) records from files [or
standard input] and generates PostScript code that will plot
symbols at those locations on a ternary diagram. If a symbol
is <br>
selected and no symbol size given, then psternary will
interpret the fourth column of the input data as symbol
size. Symbols whose size is &lt;= 0 are skipped. If no
symbols are <br>
specified then the symbol code (see -S below) must be
present as last column in the input. The PostScript code is
written to standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS <br>
table One or more ASCII (or binary, see -bi[ncols][type])
data table file(s) holding a number of data columns. If no
tables are given then we read from standard input. Use -T to
<br>
ignore all input files, including standard input (see
below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B[a|b|c]*args* <br>
For ternary diagrams the three sides are referred to as a,
b, and c. Thus, to give specific settings for one of these
axis you must include the axis letter before the <br>
arguments. If all axes have the same arguments then only
give one option without the axis letter. For more details,
see the -B discussion in psbasemap.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Ccpt Give a CPT or specify
-Ccolor1,color2[,color3,&acirc;&brvbar;] to build a linear
continuous CPT from those colors automatically. In this case
colorn can be a r/g/b triplet, a color <br>
name, or an HTML hexadecimal color (e.g. #aabbcc ). If -S is
set, let symbol fill color be determined by the z-value in
the fourth column. Additional fields are shifted <br>
over by one column (optional size would be 5th rather than
4th field, etc.).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Gfill Select color or pattern
for filling of symbols [Default is no fill]. Note that
psternary will search for -G and -W strings in all the
segment headers and let any values <br>
thus found over-ride the command line settings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-JXwidth [unit] <br>
The only valid projection is linear plot with specified
ternary width.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-K (more &acirc;&brvbar;) <br>
Do not finalize the PostScript plot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-La/b/c <br>
Set the labels for the three diagram vertices [none]. These
are placed a distance of 3 times the MAP_LABEL_OFFSET
setting from their respective corners.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M Do no plotting. Instead,
convert the input (a,b,c[,*z*]) records to Cartesian
(x,y,[,*z*]) records, where x, y are normalized coordinates
on the triangle (i.e., 0-1 in <br>
xand 0-sqrt(3)/2 in y).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N Do NOT clip symbols that fall
outside map border [Default plots points whose coordinates
are strictly inside the map border only].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O (more &acirc;&brvbar;) <br>
Append to existing PostScript plot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P (more &acirc;&brvbar;) <br>
Select &acirc;Portrait&acirc; plot orientation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Ramin/amax/bmin/bmax/cmin/cmax
<br>
Give the min and max limits for each of the three axis a, b,
and c.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S[symbol][size[u]] <br>
Plot symbols (including vectors, pie slices, fronts,
decorated or quoted lines). If present, size is symbol size
in the unit set in gmt.conf (unless c, i, or p is <br>
appended). If the symbol code (see below) is not given it
will be read from the last column in the input data; this
cannot be used in conjunction with binary input. <br>
Optionally, append c, i, or p to indicate that the size
information in the input data is in units of cm, inch, or
point, respectively [Default is PROJ_LENGTH_UNIT]. Note:
<br>
if you provide both size and symbol via the input file you
must use PROJ_LENGTH_UNIT to indicate the unit used for the
symbol size or append the units to the sizes in the <br>
file. If symbol sizes are expected via the third data column
then you may convert those values to suitable symbol sizes
via the -i mechanism.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The uppercase symbols A, C, D,
G, H, I, N, S, T are normalized to have the same area as a
circle with diameter size, while the size of the
corresponding lowercase symbols <br>
refers to the diameter of a circumscribed circle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can change symbols by adding
the required -S option to any of your multisegment
headers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Choose between these symbol
codes:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S- x-dash (-). size is the
length of a short horizontal (x-dir) line segment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S+ plus (+). size is diameter
of circumscribing circle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Sa star. size is diameter of
circumscribing circle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Sb[size[c|i|p|u]][b[base]] <br>
Vertical bar extending from base to y. size is bar width.
Append u if size is in x-units [Default is plot-distance
units]. By default, base = ymin. Append b[base] <br>
to change this value. If base is not appended then we read
it from the last input data column.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-SB[size[c|i|p|u]][b[base]] <br>
Horizontal bar extending from base to x. size is bar width.
Append u if size is in y-units [Default is plot-distance
units]. By default, base = xmin. Append <br>
b[base] to change this value. If base is not appended then
we read it from the last input data column.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Sc circle. size is diameter of
circle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Sd diamond. size is diameter of
circumscribing circle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Se ellipse. Direction (in
degrees counter-clockwise from horizontal), major_axis, and
minor_axis must be found in columns 3, 4, and 5.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-SE Same as -Se, except azimuth
(in degrees east of north) should be given instead of
direction. The azimuth will be mapped into an angle based on
the chosen map pro&acirc; <br>
jection (-Se leaves the directions unchanged.) Furthermore,
the axes lengths must be given in geographical instead of
plot-distance units. An exception occurs for <br>
a linear projection in which we assume the ellipse axes are
given in the same units as -R. For degenerate ellipses
(circles) with just the diameter given, use <br>
-SE-. The diameter is excepted to be given in column 3.
Alternatively, append the desired diameter to -SE- and this
fixed diameter is used instead. For allowable <br>
geographical units, see UNITS.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Sfgap[/size][+l|+r][+b+c+f+s+t][+ooffset][+p[pen]].
<br>
Draw a front. Supply distance gap between symbols and symbol
size. If gap is negative, it is interpreted to mean the
number of symbols along the front instead. If <br>
size is missing it is set to 30% of the gap, except when gap
is negative and size is thus required. Append +l or +r to
plot symbols on the left or right side of <br>
the front [Default is centered]. Append +type to specify
which symbol to plot: box, circle, fault, slip, or triangle.
[Default is fault]. Slip means left-lateral or <br>
right-lateral strike-slip arrows (centered is not an
option). The +s modifier optionally accepts the angle used
to draw the vector [20]. Alternatively, use +S <br>
which draws arcuate arrow heads. Append +ooffset to offset
the first symbol from the beginning of the front by that
amount [0]. The chosen symbol is drawn with the <br>
same pen as set for the line (i.e., via -W). The use an
alternate pen, append +ppen. To skip the outline, just use
+p. Note: By placing -Sf options in the seg&acirc; <br>
ment header you can change the front types on a
segment-by-segment basis.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Sg octagon. size is diameter of
circumscribing circle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Sh hexagon. size is diameter of
circumscribing circle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Si inverted triangle. size is
diameter of circumscribing circle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Sj Rotated rectangle. Direction
(in degrees counter-clockwise from horizontal), x-dimension,
and y-dimension must be found in columns 3, 4, and 5.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-SJ Same as -Sj, except azimuth
(in degrees east of north) should be given instead of
direction. The azimuth will be mapped into an angle based on
the chosen map pro&acirc; <br>
jection (-Sj leaves the directions unchanged.) Furthermore,
the dimensions must be given in geographical instead of
plot-distance units. For a degenerate rectangle <br>
(square) with one dimension given, use -SJ-. The dimension
is excepted to be given in column 3. Alternatively, append
the dimension diameter to -SJ- and this <br>
fixed dimension is used instead. An exception occurs for a
linear projection in which we assume the dimensions are
given in the same units as -R. For allowable <br>
geographical units, see UNITS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Sk kustom symbol. Append
name/size, and we will look for a definition file called
name.def in (1) the current directory or (2) in ~/.gmt or
(3) in $GMT_SHAREDIR/cus&acirc; <br>
tom. The symbol as defined in that file is of size 1.0 by
default; the appended size will scale symbol accordingly.
Users may add their own custom *.def files; see <br>
CUSTOM SYMBOLS below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Sl letter or text string (less
than 256 characters). Give size, and append +tstring after
the size. Note that the size is only approximate; no
individual scaling is <br>
done for different characters. Remember to escape special
characters like *. Optionally, you may append +ffont to
select a particular font [Default is <br>
FONT_ANNOT_PRIMARY] and +jjustify to change justification
[CM].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Sm math angle arc, optionally
with one or two arrow heads [Default is no arrow heads]. The
size is the length of the vector head. Arc width is set by
-W. The radius of <br>
the arc and its start and stop directions (in degrees
counter-clockwise from horizontal) must be given in columns
3-5. See VECTOR ATTRIBUTES for specifying other <br>
attributes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-SM Same as -Sm but switches to
straight angle symbol if angles subtend 90 degrees
exactly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Sn pentagon. size is diameter
of circumscribing circle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Sp point. No size needs to be
specified (1 pixel is used).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Sq quoted line, i.e., lines
with annotations such as contours. Append
[d|D|f|l|L|n|N|s|S|x|X]info[:labelinfo]. The required
argument controls the placement of labels <br>
along the quoted lines. Choose among six controlling
algorithms:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ddist[c|i|p] or
Ddist[d|e|f|k|m|M|n|s] <br>
For lower case d, give distances between labels on the plot
in your preferred measurement unit c (cm), i (inch), or p
(points), while for upper case D, <br>
specify distances in map units and append the unit; choose
among e (m), f (foot), k (km), M (mile), n (nautical mile)
or u (US survey foot), and d (arc <br>
degree), m (arc minute), or s (arc second). [Default is 10c
or 4i]. As an option, you can append /fraction which is used
to place the very first label <br>
for each contour when the cumulative along-contour distance
equals fraction * dist [0.25].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fffile.d <br>
Reads the ASCII file ffile.d and places labels at locations
in the file that matches locations along the quoted lines.
Inexact matches and points outside <br>
the region are skipped.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">l|Lline1[,line2,&acirc;&brvbar;]
<br>
Give the coordinates of the end points for one or more
comma-separated straight line segments. Labels will be
placed where these lines intersect the <br>
quoted lines. The format of each line specification is
start_lon/start_lat/stop_lon/stop_lat. Both
start_lon/start_lat and stop_lon/stop_lat can be <br>
replaced by a 2-character key that uses the justification
format employed in pstext to indicate a point on the frame
or center of the map, given as <br>
[LCR][BMT]. L will interpret the point pairs as defining
great circles [Default is straight line].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">n|Nn_label <br>
Specifies the number of equidistant labels for quoted lines
[1]. Upper case N starts labeling exactly at the start of
the line [Default centers them along <br>
the line]. N-1 places one justified label at start, while
N+1 places one justified label at the end of quoted lines.
Optionally, append /min_dist[c|i|p] <br>
to enforce that a minimum distance separation between
successive labels is enforced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">s|Sn_label <br>
Same as n|Nn_label but implies that the input data are first
to be converted into a series of 2-point line segments
before plotting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">x|Xxfile.d <br>
Reads the multisegment file xfile.d and places labels at the
intersections between the quoted lines and the lines in
xfile.d. X will resample the lines <br>
first along great-circle arcs. In addition, you may
optionally append +rradius[c|i|p] to set a minimum label
separation in the x-y plane [no limitation].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The optional labelinfo controls
the specifics of the label formatting and consists of a
concatenated string made up of any of the following control
arguments:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+aangle <br>
For annotations at a fixed angle, +an for line-normal, or
+ap for line-parallel [Default].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+cdx[/dy] <br>
Sets the clearance between label and optional text box.
Append c|i|p to specify the unit or % to indicate a
percentage of the label font size [15%].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+d Turns on debug which will
draw helper points and lines to illustrate the workings of
the quoted line setup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+e Delay the plotting of the
text. This is used to build a clip path based on the text,
then lay down other overlays while that clip path is in
effect, then <br>
turning of clipping with psclip -Cs which finally plots the
original text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+ffont Sets the desired font
[Default FONT_ANNOT_PRIMARY with its size changed to
9p].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+g[color] <br>
Selects opaque text boxes [Default is transparent];
optionally specify the color [Default is PS_PAGE_COLOR].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+jjust Sets label justification
[Default is MC]. Ignored when -SqN|n+|-1 is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+llabel <br>
Sets the constant label text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+Lflag Sets the label text
according to the specified flag:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+Lh Take the label from the
current segment header (first scan for an embedded -Llabel
option, if not use the first word following the segment
flag). For <br>
multiple-word labels, enclose entire label in double quotes.
+Ld Take the Cartesian plot distances along the line as the
label; append c|i|p as the unit <br>
[Default is PROJ_LENGTH_UNIT]. +LD Calculate actual map
distances; append d|e|f|k|n|M|n|s as the unit [Default is
d(egrees), unless label placement was <br>
based on map distances along the lines in which case we use
the same unit specified for that algorithm]. Requires a map
projection to be used. +Lf Use <br>
text after the 2nd column in the fixed label location file
as the label. Requires the fixed label location setting. +Lx
As +Lh but use the headers in the <br>
xfile.d instead. Requires the crossing file option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+ndx[/dy] <br>
Nudges the placement of labels by the specified amount
(append c|i|p to specify the units). Increments are
considered in the coordinate system defined by <br>
the orientation of the line; use +N to force increments in
the plot x/y coordinates system [no nudging]. Not allowed
with +v.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+o Selects rounded rectangular
text box [Default is rectangular]. Not applicable for curved
text (+v) and only makes sense for opaque text boxes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+p[pen] <br>
Draws the outline of text boxes [Default is no outline];
optionally specify pen for outline [Default is width =
0.25p, color = black, style = solid].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+rmin_rad <br>
Will not place labels where the line&acirc;s radius of
curvature is less than min_rad [Default is 0].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+t[file] <br>
Saves line label x, y, and text to file [Line_labels.txt].
Use +T to save x, y, angle, text instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+uunit Appends unit to all line
labels. If unit starts with a leading hyphen (-) then there
will be no space between label value and the unit. [Default
is no <br>
unit].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+v Specifies curved labels
following the path [Default is straight labels].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+w Specifies how many (x,y)
points will be used to estimate label angles [Default is
10].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+x[first,last] <br>
Append the suffices first and last to the corresponding
labels. This modifier is only available when -SqN2 is in
effect. Used to annotate the start and <br>
end of a line (e.g., a cross-section), append two text
strings separated by comma [Default just adds a prime to the
second label].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+=prefix <br>
Prepends prefix to all line labels. If prefix starts with a
leading hyphen (-) then there will be no space between label
value and the prefix. [Default is <br>
no prefix].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: By placing -Sq options in
the segment header you can change the quoted text attributes
on a segment-by-segment basis.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Sr rectangle. No size needs to
be specified, but the x- and y-dimensions must be found in
columns 3 and 4.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-SR Rounded rectangle. No size
needs to be specified, but the x- and y-dimensions and
corner radius must be found in columns 3, 4, and 5.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Ss square. size is diameter of
circumscribing circle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-St triangle. size is diameter
of circumscribing circle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Sv vector. Direction (in
degrees counter-clockwise from horizontal) and length must
be found in columns 3 and 4, and size, if not specified on
the command-line, should <br>
be present in column 5. The size is the length of the vector
head. Vector width is set by -W. See VECTOR ATTRIBUTES for
specifying other attributes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-SV Same as -Sv, except azimuth
(in degrees east of north) should be given instead of
direction. The azimuth will be mapped into an angle based on
the chosen map pro&acirc; <br>
jection (-Sv leaves the directions unchanged.) See VECTOR
ATTRIBUTES for specifying other attributes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Sw pie wedge. Start and stop
directions (in degrees counter-clockwise from horizontal)
for pie slice must be found in columns 3 and 4. Append +a to
just draw the arc <br>
line or +r to just draw the radial lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-SW Same as -Sw, except azimuths
(in degrees east of north) should be given instead of the
two directions. The azimuths will be mapped into angles
based on the chosen <br>
map projection (-Sw leaves the directions unchanged.) For
geo-wedges, specify size as a radial geographical distance.
For allowable geographical units, see UNITS. <br>
Append +a to just draw the arc or +r to just draw the radial
lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Sx cross (x). size is diameter
of circumscribing circle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Sy y-dash (|). size is the
length of a short vertical (y-dir) line segment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S= geovector. Azimuth (in
degrees east from north) and geographical length must be
found in columns 3 and 4. The size is the length of the
vector head. Vector width is <br>
set by -W. See VECTOR ATTRIBUTES for specifying attributes.
Note: Geovector stems are drawn as thin filled polygons and
hence pen attributes like dashed and dotted <br>
are not available. For allowable geographical units, see
UNITS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S~ decorated line, i.e., lines
with symbols along them. Append
[d|D|f|l|L|n|N|s|S|x|X]info[:symbolinfo]. The required

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UNITS <br>
For map distance unit, append unit d for arc degree, m for
arc minute, and s for arc second, or e for meter [Default],
f for foot, k for km, M for statute mile, n for nautical
<br>
mile, and u for US survey foot. By default we compute such
distances using a spherical approximation with great
circles. Prepend - to a distance (or the unit is no distance
is <br>
given) to perform &acirc;Flat Earth&acirc; calculations
(quicker but less accurate) or prepend + to perform exact
geodesic calculations (slower but more accurate).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VECTOR ATTRIBUTES <br>
Several modifiers may be appended to the vector-producing
options to specify the placement of vector heads, their
shapes, and the justification of the vector. Below, left and
<br>
right refers to the side of the vector line when viewed from
the start point to the end point of the segment: <br>
+aangle sets the angle of the vector head apex [30].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+b places a vector head at the
beginning of the vector path [none]. Optionally, append t
for a terminal line, c for a circle, a for arrow [Default],
i for tail, A for plain <br>
arrow, and I for plain tail. Further append l|r to only draw
the left or right side of this head [both sides].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+e places a vector head at the
end of the vector path [none]. Optionally, append t for a
terminal line, c for a circle, a for arrow [Default], i for
tail, A for plain arrow, <br>
and I for plain tail. Further append l|r to only draw the
left or right side of this head [both sides].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+g-|fill turns off vector head
fill (if -) or sets the vector head fill [Default fill is
used, which may be no fill].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+hshape sets the shape of the
vector head (range -2/2). Default is controlled by
MAP_VECTOR_SHAPE [0].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+l draws half-arrows, using only
the left side of specified heads [both sides].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+m places a vector head at the
mid-point the vector path [none]. Append f or r for forward
or reverse direction of the vector [forward]. Optionally,
append t for a terminal <br>
line, c for a circle, or a for arrow head [Default]. Further
append l|r to only draw the left or right side of this head
[both sides]. Cannot be combined with +b or +e.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+nnorm scales down vector
attributes (pen thickness, head size) with decreasing
length, where vectors shorter than norm will have their
attributes scaled by length/norm [arrow <br>
attributes remains invariant to length].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+oplon/plat specifies the
oblique pole for the great or small circles. Only needed for
great circles if +q is given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+p[-][pen] sets the vector pen
attributes. If pen has a leading - then the head outline is
not drawn. [Default pen is used, and head outline is
drawn]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+q means the input angle, length
data instead represent the start and stop opening angles of
the arc segment relative to the given point.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+r draws half-arrows, using only
the right side of specified heads [both sides].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+t[b|e]trim will shift the
beginning or end point (or both) along the vector segment by
the given trim; append suitable unit. If the modifiers b|e
are not used then trim may <br>
be two values separated by a slash, which is used to specify
different trims for the two ends. Positive trims will
shorted the vector while negative trims will lengthen it
<br>
[no trim].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition, all but circular
vectors may take these modifiers: <br>
+jjust determines how the input x,y point relates to the
vector. Choose from beginning [default], end, or center.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+s means the input angle, length
are instead the x, y coordinates of the vector end
point.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, Cartesian vectors may
take these modifiers: <br>
+zscale[unit] expects input dx,dy vector components and uses
the scale to convert to polar coordinates with length in
given unit.</p>
