<p>SHIGOFUMI(1) Manual for Shigofumi SHIGOFUMI(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
shigofumi - ISDS client</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
shigofumi [-c FILE]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">shigofumi [-c FILE] -e
COMMANDS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">shigofumi -V</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Shigofumi is an ISDS client based on libisds library. The
client can access ISDS, processes local message and delivery
details, and submit file to authorized conversion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Shigofumi is command line
oriented program. Once you start it, use help to get list of
embedded commands. Use help COMMAND to get details about
selected COMMAND. Be ware that <br>
command listing changes contextually. User can use casual
readline shortcuts for line editing (like tab
completing).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">While transmitting data over
Internet, a progress-bar is updated. User can cancel current
network operation by emitting SIGINT signal (Ctrl+C
usually).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-c FILE <br>
Use configuration FILE instead of default one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e COMMANDS <br>
Run shigofumi in batch mode: execute each command and
terminate then. ). If any</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Commands are delimited by new
line (or command fails, other commands will not be processed
and shigofumi will quit immediately with non-zero exit code.
If all <br>
commands succeed, shigofumi will return zero code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example 1. Authorized Conversion
from Shell</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ shigofumi -e &rsquo;convert
/etc/passwd&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The command submits /etc/passwd
file to authorized conversion. Although it&rsquo;s
syntactically correct, it will fail because plain text files
are not allowed to be converted. <br>
Check always return code in your scripts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V <br>
Show program version and linked libraries details and
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SHIGOFUMI COMMAND LANGUAGE <br>
The language is straightforward. Each command is one case
sensitive word followed by (empty) sequence of arguments.
Command and arguments are separated by one or more white
spa&acirc; <br>
ces. If you need to embed white space into argument, use
backslash ( to escape it. If you need to write backslash,
escape it with backslash again. Also quotation is supported
<br>
with double quotes (&quot;). White space and pipe symbol
loose their delimiting properties until next double quotes.
Backslash is still meta-character inside quoted string and
it can <br>
be used to embed double quotes into quoted string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The argument list can be
terminated prematurely with pipe character (|). In that
case, the rest of the line will be considered as shell
command and output of preceding shigofumi <br>
command will be passed to standard input of the shell
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If argument type is file name,
you can use tilde symbol (~) as abbreviation for
user&rsquo;s home directory. Home directory is derived from
HOME environment variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Command names, file names and
message identifiers can be completed by pressing completion
key (depends on readline configuration, Tab usually). They
are expanded only after com&acirc; <br>
mands expecting argument of appropriate type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Set of available commands
changes with context. E.g. If a message is loaded, commands
for message operation like save to file will become
available. Also meaning of the same com&acirc; <br>
mand can change. E.g. show command will print list of
incoming messages if such list is loaded; if a message is
loaded, it will print the message. List of currently
available <br>
commands can be obtained by help command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Syntax help for a command is
printed after calling command with invalid option or by help
command with interested command as first argument. Command
option -h is reserved as in&acirc; <br>
valid option and shows always command usage.</p>
