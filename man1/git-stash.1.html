<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
git-stash - Stash the changes in a dirty working directory
away</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
git stash list [&lt;options&gt;] <br>
git stash show [&lt;stash&gt;] <br>
git stash drop [-q|--quiet] [&lt;stash&gt;] <br>
git stash ( pop | apply ) [--index] [-q|--quiet]
[&lt;stash&gt;] <br>
git stash branch &lt;branchname&gt; [&lt;stash&gt;] <br>
git stash [save [--patch] [-k|--[no-]keep-index]
[-q|--quiet] <br>
[-u|--include-untracked] [-a|--all] [&lt;message&gt;]] <br>
git stash clear <br>
git stash create</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Use git stash when you want to record the current state of
the working directory and the index, but want to go back to
a clean working directory. The command saves your local <br>
modifications away and reverts the working directory to
match the HEAD commit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The modifications stashed away
by this command can be listed with git stash list, inspected
with git stash show, and restored (potentially on top of a
different commit) with git <br>
stash apply. Calling git stash without any arguments is
equivalent to git stash save. A stash is by default listed
as &quot;WIP on branchname ...&quot;, but you can give a
more descriptive <br>
message on the command line when you create one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The latest stash you created is
stored in refs/stash; older stashes are found in the reflog
of this reference and can be named using the usual reflog
syntax (e.g. stash@{0} is <br>
the most recently created stash, stash@{1} is the one before
it, stash@{2.hours.ago} is also possible).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
save [-p|--patch] [--[no-]keep-index]
[-u|--include-untracked] [-a|--all] [-q|--quiet]
[&lt;message&gt;] <br>
Save your local modifications to a new stash, and run git
reset --hard to revert them. The &lt;message&gt; part is
optional and gives the description along with the stashed
state. <br>
For quickly making a snapshot, you can omit both
&quot;save&quot; and &lt;message&gt;, but giving only
&lt;message&gt; does not trigger this action to prevent a
misspelled subcommand from making <br>
an unwanted stash.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the --keep-index option is
used, all changes already added to the index are left
intact.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the --include-untracked
option is used, all untracked files are also stashed and
then cleaned up with git clean, leaving the working
directory in a very clean state. If <br>
the --all option is used instead then the ignored files are
stashed and cleaned in addition to the untracked files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With --patch, you can
interactively select hunks from the diff between HEAD and
the working tree to be stashed. The stash entry is
constructed such that its index state is <br>
the same as the index state of your repository, and its
worktree contains only the changes you selected
interactively. The selected changes are then rolled back
from your <br>
worktree. See the &acirc;Interactive Mode&acirc; section of
git-add(1) to learn how to operate the --patch mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The --patch option implies
--keep-index. You can use --no-keep-index to override
this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list [&lt;options&gt;] <br>
List the stashes that you currently have. Each stash is
listed with its name (e.g. stash@{0} is the latest stash,
stash@{1} is the one before, etc.), the name of the branch
<br>
that was current when the stash was made, and a short
description of the commit the stash was based on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">stash@{0}: WIP on submit:
6ebd0e2... Update git-stash documentation <br>
stash@{1}: On master: 9cc0589... Add git-stash</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The command takes options
applicable to the git log command to control what is shown
and how. See git-log(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">show [&lt;stash&gt;] <br>
Show the changes recorded in the stash as a diff between the
stashed state and its original parent. When no &lt;stash&gt;
is given, shows the latest one. By default, the command <br>
shows the diffstat, but it will accept any format known to
git diff (e.g., git stash show -p stash@{1} to view the
second most recent stash in patch form).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pop [--index] [-q|--quiet]
[&lt;stash&gt;] <br>
Remove a single stashed state from the stash list and apply
it on top of the current working tree state, i.e., do the
inverse operation of git stash save. The working <br>
directory must match the index.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Applying the state can fail with
conflicts; in this case, it is not removed from the stash
list. You need to resolve the conflicts by hand and call git
stash drop manually <br>
afterwards.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the --index option is used,
then tries to reinstate not only the working tree&acirc;s
changes, but also the index&acirc;s ones. However, this can
fail, when you have conflicts (which <br>
are stored in the index, where you therefore can no longer
apply the changes as they were originally).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When no &lt;stash&gt; is given,
stash@{0} is assumed, otherwise &lt;stash&gt; must be a
reference of the form stash@{&lt;revision&gt;}.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">apply [--index] [-q|--quiet]
[&lt;stash&gt;] <br>
Like pop, but do not remove the state from the stash list.
Unlike pop, &lt;stash&gt; may be any commit that looks like
a commit created by stash save or stash create.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">branch &lt;branchname&gt;
[&lt;stash&gt;] <br>
Creates and checks out a new branch named &lt;branchname&gt;
starting from the commit at which the &lt;stash&gt; was
originally created, applies the changes recorded in
&lt;stash&gt; to the <br>
new working tree and index. If that succeeds, and
&lt;stash&gt; is a reference of the form
stash@{&lt;revision&gt;}, it then drops the &lt;stash&gt;.
When no &lt;stash&gt; is given, applies the <br>
latest one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is useful if the branch on
which you ran git stash save has changed enough that git
stash apply fails due to conflicts. Since the stash is
applied on top of the commit <br>
that was HEAD at the time git stash was run, it restores the
originally stashed state with no conflicts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">clear <br>
Remove all the stashed states. Note that those states will
then be subject to pruning, and may be impossible to recover
(see Examples below for a possible strategy).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">drop [-q|--quiet]
[&lt;stash&gt;] <br>
Remove a single stashed state from the stash list. When no
&lt;stash&gt; is given, it removes the latest one. i.e.
stash@{0}, otherwise &lt;stash&gt; must be a valid stash log
reference <br>
of the form stash@{&lt;revision&gt;}.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">create <br>
Create a stash (which is a regular commit object) and return
its object name, without storing it anywhere in the ref
namespace.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DISCUSSION <br>
A stash is represented as a commit whose tree records the
state of the working directory, and its first parent is the
commit at HEAD when the stash was created. The tree of the
<br>
second parent records the state of the index when the stash
is made, and it is made a child of the HEAD commit. The
ancestry graph looks like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">.----W <br>
/ / <br>
-----H----I</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where H is the HEAD commit, I is
a commit that records the state of the index, and W is a
commit that records the state of the working tree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Pulling into a dirty tree <br>
When you are in the middle of something, you learn that
there are upstream changes that are possibly relevant to
what you are doing. When your local changes do not conflict
<br>
with the changes in the upstream, a simple git pull will let
you move forward.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, there are cases in
which your local changes do conflict with the upstream
changes, and git pull refuses to overwrite your changes. In
such a case, you can stash your <br>
changes away, perform a pull, and then unstash, like
this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git pull <br>
... <br>
file foobar not up to date, cannot merge. <br>
$ git stash <br>
$ git pull <br>
$ git stash pop</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Interrupted workflow <br>
When you are in the middle of something, your boss comes in
and demands that you fix something immediately.
Traditionally, you would make a commit to a temporary branch
to <br>
store your changes away, and return to your original branch
to make the emergency fix, like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># ... hack hack hack ... <br>
$ git checkout -b my_wip <br>
$ git commit -a -m &quot;WIP&quot; <br>
$ git checkout master <br>
$ edit emergency fix <br>
$ git commit -a -m &quot;Fix in a hurry&quot; <br>
$ git checkout my_wip <br>
$ git reset --soft HEAD^ <br>
# ... continue hacking ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can use git stash to
simplify the above, like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># ... hack hack hack ... <br>
$ git stash <br>
$ edit emergency fix <br>
$ git commit -a -m &quot;Fix in a hurry&quot; <br>
$ git stash pop <br>
# ... continue hacking ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Testing partial commits <br>
You can use git stash save --keep-index when you want to
make two or more commits out of the changes in the work
tree, and you want to test each change before
committing:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># ... hack hack hack ... <br>
$ git add --patch foo # add just first part to the index
<br>
$ git stash save --keep-index # save all other changes to
the stash <br>
$ edit/build/test first part <br>
$ git commit -m &rsquo;First part&rsquo; # commit fully
tested change <br>
$ git stash pop # prepare to work on all other changes <br>
# ... repeat above five steps until one commit remains ...
<br>
$ edit/build/test remaining parts <br>
$ git commit foo -m &rsquo;Remaining parts&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Recovering stashes that were
cleared/dropped erroneously <br>
If you mistakenly drop or clear stashes, they cannot be
recovered through the normal safety mechanisms. However, you
can try the following incantation to get a list of <br>
stashes that are still in your repository, but not reachable
any more:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">git fsck --unreachable | <br>
grep commit | cut -d&nbsp; -f3 | <br>
xargs git log --merges --no-walk --grep=WIP</p>
