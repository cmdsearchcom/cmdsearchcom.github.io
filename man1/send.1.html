<b>Send</b> will cause each of the specified files to be delivered to each of
  the destinations in the &#x201C;To:&#x201D;, &#x201C;cc:&#x201D;,
  &#x201C;Bcc:&#x201D;, &#x201C;Dcc:&#x201D;, and &#x201C;Fcc:&#x201D; fields of
  the message. If <b>send</b> is re-distributing a message, as invoked from
  <b>dist</b>, then the corresponding &#x201C;Resent-xxx&#x201D; fields are
  examined instead.
<div class="Pp"></div>
By default, <b>send</b> uses the program <b>post</b> to do the actual delivery
  of the messages, although this can be changed by defining the <i>postproc</i>
  profile component. Most of the features attributed to <b>send</b> are actually
  performed by <b>post</b>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Before <b>send</b> gives the message to <b>post</b> for delivery, the message is
  processed by <b>mhbuild</b> to perform any necessary MIME encoding of the
  outgoing message. This can be changed by the <i>buildmimeproc</i> profile
  component. <b>mhbuild</b> is invoked with the <b>-auto</b> switch, so
  <b>mhbuild</b> directives are not processed by default. See <i>mhbuild</i>(1)
  for more information.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>mhbuild</b> will scan the message draft for a header named <i>Attach</i>. The
  draft is converted to a MIME message if one or more matches are found. This
  conversion occurs before all other processing. The <i>whatnow</i>(1) man page
  describes the user interface for managing MIME attachments via this mechanism.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The first part of the MIME message is the draft body if that body contains any
  non-blank characters. The body of each <i>Attach</i> header field is
  interpreted as a file name, and each file named is included as a separate part
  in the MIME message.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Determination of the content MIME type inserted into the Content-Type header for
  each part depends on how the <b>nmh</b> installation was configured. If a
  program, such as <b>file</b> with a <b>--mime</b> or <b>-i</b> option, was
  found that can specify the type of a file as a MIME type string, then that
  will be used. To determine if your <b>nmh</b> was so configured, run
  <b>mhparam mimetypeproc</b> and see if a non-empty string is displayed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If your <b>nmh</b> was not configured with a program to specify a file type as a
  MIME string, then a different method is used to determine the content-type
  string. For file names with dot suffixes, the profile is scanned for a
  <i>mhshow-suffix-</i> entry for that suffix. The content-type for the part is
  taken from that profile entry if a match is found. If a match is not found in
  the user profile, the mhn.defaults profile is scanned next. If no match is
  found or the file does not have a dot suffix, the content-type is text/plain
  if the file contains only ASCII characters or application/octet-stream if it
  contains characters outside of the ASCII range. See <i>mhshow</i>(1) for more
  details and example syntax.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Each attached MIME part contains a &#x201C;Content-Description&#x201D; header
  that includes the filename, and adds a &#x201C;Content-Disposition&#x201D;
  header. Here is an example of MIME part headers for an attachment:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
Content-Type: text/plain; name=&quot;VERSION&quot;; charset=&quot;us-ascii&quot;
Content-Description: VERSION
Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=&quot;VERSION&quot;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If <b>-push</b> is specified, <b>send</b> will detach itself from the user's
  terminal and perform its actions in the background. If <b>push</b>'d and the
  draft can't be sent, then an error message will be sent (using the mailproc)
  back to the user. If <b>-forward</b> is given, then a copy of the draft will
  be attached to this failure notice. Using <b>-push</b> differs from putting
  <b>send</b> in the background because the output is trapped and analyzed by
  <b>nmh</b>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If <b>-verbose</b> is specified, <b>send</b> will indicate the interactions
  occurring with the transport system, prior to actual delivery. If
  <b>-watch</b> is specified <b>send</b> will monitor the delivery of local and
  network mail. Hence, by specifying both switches, a large detail of
  information can be gathered about each step of the message's entry into the
  transport system.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-draftfolder</b> <i>+folder</i> and <b>-draftmessage</b> <i>msg</i>
  switches invoke the <b>nmh</b> draft folder facility. This is an advanced (and
  highly useful) feature. Consult the <i>mh-draft</i>(5) man page for more
  information.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If <b>-split</b> is specified, <b>send</b> will split the draft into one or more
  partial messages prior to sending. This makes use of the MIME features in
  <b>nmh</b>. Note however that if <b>send</b> is invoked under <b>dist</b>,
  then this switch is ignored&#x2002;--&#x2002;it makes no sense to redistribute
  a message in this fashion. Sometimes you want <b>send</b> to pause after
  posting a partial message. This is usually the case when you are running
  <b>sendmail</b> and expect to generate a lot of partial messages. The argument
  to <b>-split</b> tells it how long to pause between postings.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Send</b> with no <i>file</i> argument will query whether the draft is the
  intended file, whereas <b>-draft</b> will suppress this question. Once the
  transport system has successfully accepted custody of the message, the file
  will be renamed with a site-dependent prefix (usually a comma), which allows
  it to be retrieved until the next draft message is sent. If there are errors
  in the formatting of the message, <b>send</b> will abort with a (hopefully)
  helpful error message.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If a &#x201C;Bcc:&#x201D; field is encountered, its addresses will be used for
  delivery, and the &#x201C;Bcc:&#x201D; field will be removed from the message
  sent to sighted recipients. The blind recipients will receive an entirely new
  message with a minimal set of headers. Included in the body of the message
  will be a copy of the message sent to the sighted recipients.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If a &#x201C;Dcc:&#x201D; field is encountered and the <b>sendmail/pipe</b> mail
  transport method is not in use, its addresses will be used for delivery, and
  the &#x201C;Dcc:&#x201D; field will be removed from the message. The blind
  recipients will receive the same message sent to the sighted recipients.
  *WARNING* Recipients listed in the &#x201C;Dcc:&#x201D; field receive no
  explicit indication that they have received a &#x201C;blind copy&#x201D;. This
  can cause blind recipients to inadvertently reply to all of the sighted
  recipients of the original message, revealing that they received a blind copy.
  On the other hand, since a normal reply to a message sent via a
  &#x201C;Bcc:&#x201D; field will generate a reply only to the sender of the
  original message, it takes extra effort in most mailers to reply to the
  included message, and so would usually only be done deliberately, rather than
  by accident.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If <b>-filter</b> <i>filterfile</i> is specified, then this copy is filtered
  (re-formatted) by <b>mhl</b> prior to being sent to the blind recipients.
  Alternately, if you specify the <b>-mime</b> switch, then <b>send</b> will use
  the MIME rules for encapsulation.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Prior to sending the message, the &#x201C;Date:&#x00A0;now&#x201D; field will be
  appended to the headers in the message. If <b>-msgid</b> is specified, then a
  &#x201C;Message-ID:&#x201D; field will also be added to the message.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-messageid</b> switch selects the style used for the part appearing after
  the @ in &#x201C;Message-ID:&#x201D;, &#x201C;Resent-Message-ID:&#x201D;, and
  &#x201C;Content-ID:&#x201D; header fields. The two acceptable options are
  <b>localname</b> (which is the default), and <b>random</b>. With
  <b>localname</b>, the local hostname is used. With <b>random</b>, a random
  sequence of characters is used instead. Note that the <b>-msgid</b> switch
  must be enabled for this switch to have any effect.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If <b>send</b> is re-distributing a message (when invoked by <b>dist</b>), then
  &#x201C;Resent-&#x201D; will be prepended to each of these fields:
  &#x201C;From:&#x201D;, &#x201C;Date:&#x201D;, and &#x201C;Message-ID:&#x201D;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A &#x201C;From:&#x201D; field is required for all outgoing messages. Multiple
  addresses are permitted in the &#x201C;From:&#x201D; field, but a
  &#x201C;Sender:&#x201D; field is required in this case. Otherwise a
  &#x201C;Sender:&#x201D; field is optional.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If a message with multiple &#x201C;From:&#x201D; addresses does <b>NOT</b>
  include a &#x201C;Sender:&#x201D; field but does include an
  &#x201C;Envelope-From:&#x201D; field, the &#x201C;Envelope-From:&#x201D; field
  will be used to construct a &#x201C;Sender:&#x201D; field.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When using SMTP for mail submission, the envelope-from used for the SMTP
  transaction is derived from the &#x201C;Envelope-From:&#x201D; field. If no
  &#x201C;Envelope-From:&#x201D; field is present, the &#x201C;Sender:&#x201D;
  field is used. If neither the &#x201C;Envelope-From:&#x201D; nor the
  &#x201C;Sender:&#x201D; field is present, the &#x201C;From:&#x201D; field is
  used. When &#x201C;Envelope-From:&#x201D; appears in a message it will be
  removed from the final outgoing message.
<div class="Pp"></div>
By using the <b>-format</b> switch, each of the entries in the
  &#x201C;To:&#x201D; and &#x201C;cc:&#x201D; fields will be replaced with
  &#x201C;standard&#x201D; format entries. This standard format is designed to
  be usable by all of the message handlers on the various systems around the
  Internet. If <b>-noformat</b> is given, then headers are output exactly as
  they appear in the message draft.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If an &#x201C;Fcc:&#x00A0;folder&#x201D; is encountered, the message will be
  copied to the specified folder for the sender in the format in which it will
  appear to any non-Bcc receivers of the message. That is, it will have the
  appended fields and field reformatting. The &#x201C;Fcc:&#x201D; fields will
  be removed from all outgoing copies of the message.
<div class="Pp"></div>
By using the <b>-width</b> <i>columns</i> switch, the user can direct
  <b>send</b> as to how long it should make header lines containing addresses.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The mail transport system default is provided in <i>/etc/nmh/mts.conf</i> but
  can be overriiden here with the <b>-mts</b> switch.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If nmh is using the SMTP MTA, the <b>-server</b> and the <b>-port</b> switches
  can be used to override the default mail server (defined by the
  <i>/etc/nmh/mts.conf</i> servers entry). The <b>-snoop</b> switch can be used
  to view the SMTP transaction. (Beware that the SMTP transaction may contain
  authentication information either in plaintext or easily decoded base64.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
If <b>nmh</b> has been compiled with SASL support, the <b>-sasl</b> and
  <b>-nosasl</b> switches will enable and disable the use of SASL authentication
  with the SMTP MTA. Depending on the SASL mechanism used, this may require an
  additional password prompt from the user (but the <i>netrc</i> file can be
  used to store this password, as described in the mh-profile(5) man page). The
  <b>-saslmech</b> switch can be used to select a particular SASL mechanism, and
  the <b>-user</b> switch can be used to select a authorization userid to
  provide to SASL other than the default. The credentials profile entry in the
  mh-profile(5) man page describes the ways to supply a username and password.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If SASL authentication is successful, <b>nmh</b> will attempt to negotiate a
  security layer for session encryption. Encrypted data is labelled with
  `(encrypted)' and `(decrypted)' when viewing the SMTP transaction with the
  <b>-snoop</b> switch. The <b>-saslmaxssf</b> switch can be used to select the
  maximum value of the Security Strength Factor. This is an integer value and
  the exact meaning of this value depends on the underlying SASL mechanism. A
  value of 0 disables encryption.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If <b>nmh</b> has been compiled with TLS support, the <b>-tls</b> and
  <b>-initialtls</b> switches will require the negotiation of TLS when
  connecting to the SMTP MTA. The <b>-tls</b> switch will negotiate TLS as part
  of the normal SMTP protocol using the STARTTLS command. The <b>-initialtls</b>
  will negotiate TLS immediately after the connection has taken place, before
  any SMTP commands are sent or received. Encrypted data is labelled with
  `(tls-encrypted)' and `(tls-decrypted)' when viewing the SMTP transction with
  the <b>-snoop</b> switch. The <b>-notls</b> switch will disable all attempts
  to negotiate TLS.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The files specified by the profile entry &#x201C;Aliasfile:&#x201D; and any
  additional alias files given by the <b>-alias</b> <i>aliasfile</i> switch will
  be read (more than one file, each preceded by <b>-alias</b>, can be named).
  See <i>mh-alias</i>(5) for more information.
