<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Send will cause each of the specified files to be delivered
to each of the destinations in the &acirc;To:&acirc;,
&acirc;cc:&acirc;, &acirc;Bcc:&acirc;, &acirc;Dcc:&acirc;,
and &acirc;Fcc:&acirc; fields of the message. If send is
re-dis&acirc; <br>
tributing a message, as invoked from dist, then the
corresponding &acirc;Resent-xxx&acirc; fields are examined
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, send uses the
program post to do the actual delivery of the messages,
although this can be changed by defining the postproc
profile component. Most of the features <br>
attributed to send are actually performed by post.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Before send gives the message to
post for delivery, the message is processed by mhbuild to
perform any necessary MIME encoding of the outgoing message.
This can be changed by <br>
the buildmimeproc profile component. mhbuild is invoked with
the -auto switch, so mhbuild directives are not processed by
default. See mhbuild(1) for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mhbuild will scan the message
draft for a header named Attach. The draft is converted to a
MIME message if one or more matches are found. This
conversion occurs before all <br>
other processing. The whatnow(1) man page describes the user
interface for managing MIME attachments via this
mechanism.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first part of the MIME
message is the draft body if that body contains any
non-blank characters. The body of each Attach header field
is interpreted as a file name, and each <br>
file named is included as a separate part in the MIME
message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Determination of the content
MIME type inserted into the Content-Type header for each
part depends on how the nmh installation was configured. If
a program, such as file with a <br>
--mime or -i option, was found that can specify the type of
a file as a MIME type string, then that will be used. To
determine if your nmh was so configured, run mhparam
mime&acirc; <br>
typeproc and see if a non-empty string is displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If your nmh was not configured
with a program to specify a file type as a MIME string, then
a different method is used to determine the content-type
string. For file names with <br>
dot suffixes, the profile is scanned for a mhshow-suffix-
entry for that suffix. The content-type for the part is
taken from that profile entry if a match is found. If a
match <br>
is not found in the user profile, the mhn.defaults profile
is scanned next. If no match is found or the file does not
have a dot suffix, the content-type is text/plain if the
<br>
file contains only ASCII characters or
application/octet-stream if it contains characters outside
of the ASCII range. See mhshow(1) for more details and
example syntax.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each attached MIME part contains
a &acirc;Content-Description&acirc; header that includes the
filename, and adds a &acirc;Content-Disposition&acirc;
header. Here is an example of MIME part headers for <br>
an attachment:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Content-Type: text/plain;
name=&quot;VERSION&quot;; charset=&quot;us-ascii&quot; <br>
Content-Description: VERSION <br>
Content-Disposition: attachment;
filename=&quot;VERSION&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If -push is specified, send will
detach itself from the user&rsquo;s terminal and perform its
actions in the background. If push&rsquo;d and the draft
can&rsquo;t be sent, then an error message <br>
will be sent (using the mailproc) back to the user. If
-forward is given, then a copy of the draft will be attached
to this failure notice. Using -push differs from putting
<br>
send in the background because the output is trapped and
analyzed by nmh.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If -verbose is specified, send
will indicate the interactions occurring with the transport
system, prior to actual delivery. If -watch is specified
send will monitor the deliv&acirc; <br>
ery of local and network mail. Hence, by specifying both
switches, a large detail of information can be gathered
about each step of the message&rsquo;s entry into the
transport sys&acirc; <br>
tem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -draftfolder +folder and
-draftmessage msg switches invoke the nmh draft folder
facility. This is an advanced (and highly useful) feature.
Consult the mh-draft(5) man page <br>
for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If -split is specified, send
will split the draft into one or more partial messages prior
to sending. This makes use of the MIME features in nmh. Note
however that if send is <br>
invoked under dist, then this switch is ignored -- it makes
no sense to redistribute a message in this fashion.
Sometimes you want send to pause after posting a partial
message. <br>
This is usually the case when you are running sendmail and
expect to generate a lot of partial messages. The argument
to -split tells it how long to pause between postings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Send with no file argument will
query whether the draft is the intended file, whereas -draft
will suppress this question. Once the transport system has
successfully accepted <br>
custody of the message, the file will be renamed with a
site-dependent prefix (usually a comma), which allows it to
be retrieved until the next draft message is sent. If there
<br>
are errors in the formatting of the message, send will abort
with a (hopefully) helpful error message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a &acirc;Bcc:&acirc; field is
encountered, its addresses will be used for delivery, and
the &acirc;Bcc:&acirc; field will be removed from the
message sent to sighted recipients. The blind recipients
<br>
will receive an entirely new message with a minimal set of
headers. Included in the body of the message will be a copy
of the message sent to the sighted recipients.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a &acirc;Dcc:&acirc; field is
encountered and the sendmail/pipe mail transport method is
not in use, its addresses will be used for delivery, and the
&acirc;Dcc:&acirc; field will be removed from the <br>
message. The blind recipients will receive the same message
sent to the sighted recipients. *WARNING* Recipients listed
in the &acirc;Dcc:&acirc; field receive no explicit
indication that <br>
they have received a &acirc;blind copy&acirc;. This can
cause blind recipients to inadvertently reply to all of the
sighted recipients of the original message, revealing that
they received <br>
a blind copy. On the other hand, since a normal reply to a
message sent via a &acirc;Bcc:&acirc; field will generate a
reply only to the sender of the original message, it takes
extra <br>
effort in most mailers to reply to the included message, and
so would usually only be done deliberately, rather than by
accident.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If -filter filterfile is
specified, then this copy is filtered (re-formatted) by mhl
prior to being sent to the blind recipients. Alternately, if
you specify the -mime switch, <br>
then send will use the MIME rules for encapsulation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Prior to sending the message,
the &acirc;Date: now&acirc; field will be appended to the
headers in the message. If -msgid is specified, then a
&acirc;Message-ID:&acirc; field will also be added to the
<br>
message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -messageid switch selects
the style used for the part appearing after the @ in
&acirc;Message-ID:&acirc;, &acirc;Resent-Message-ID:&acirc;,
and &acirc;Content-ID:&acirc; header fields. The two
acceptable <br>
options are localname (which is the default), and random.
With localname, the local hostname is used. With random, a
random sequence of characters is used instead. Note that
<br>
the -msgid switch must be enabled for this switch to have
any effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If send is re-distributing a
message (when invoked by dist), then &acirc;Resent-&acirc;
will be prepended to each of these fields:
&acirc;From:&acirc;, &acirc;Date:&acirc;, and
&acirc;Message-ID:&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A &acirc;From:&acirc; field is
required for all outgoing messages. Multiple addresses are
permitted in the &acirc;From:&acirc; field, but a
&acirc;Sender:&acirc; field is required in this case.
Otherwise a <br>
&acirc;Sender:&acirc; field is optional.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a message with multiple
&acirc;From:&acirc; addresses does NOT include a
&acirc;Sender:&acirc; field but does include an
&acirc;Envelope-From:&acirc; field, the
&acirc;Envelope-From:&acirc; field will be used to construct
a <br>
&acirc;Sender:&acirc; field.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When using SMTP for mail
submission, the envelope-from used for the SMTP transaction
is derived from the &acirc;Envelope-From:&acirc; field. If
no &acirc;Envelope-From:&acirc; field is present, the <br>
&acirc;Sender:&acirc; field is used. If neither the
&acirc;Envelope-From:&acirc; nor the &acirc;Sender:&acirc;
field is present, the &acirc;From:&acirc; field is used.
When &acirc;Envelope-From:&acirc; appears in a message it
will be <br>
removed from the final outgoing message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By using the -format switch,
each of the entries in the &acirc;To:&acirc; and
&acirc;cc:&acirc; fields will be replaced with
&acirc;standard&acirc; format entries. This standard format
is designed to be usable by <br>
all of the message handlers on the various systems around
the Internet. If -noformat is given, then headers are output
exactly as they appear in the message draft.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If an &acirc;Fcc: folder&acirc;
is encountered, the message will be copied to the specified
folder for the sender in the format in which it will appear
to any non-Bcc receivers of the mes&acirc; <br>
sage. That is, it will have the appended fields and field
reformatting. The &acirc;Fcc:&acirc; fields will be removed
from all outgoing copies of the message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By using the -width columns
switch, the user can direct send as to how long it should
make header lines containing addresses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The mail transport system
default is provided in /etc/nmh/mts.conf but can be
overriiden here with the -mts switch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If nmh is using the SMTP MTA,
the -server and the -port switches can be used to override
the default mail server (defined by the /etc/nmh/mts.conf
servers entry). The -snoop <br>
switch can be used to view the SMTP transaction. (Beware
that the SMTP transaction may contain authentication
information either in plaintext or easily decoded
base64.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If nmh has been compiled with
SASL support, the -sasl and -nosasl switches will enable and
disable the use of SASL authentication with the SMTP MTA.
Depending on the SASL mecha&acirc; <br>
nism used, this may require an additional password prompt
from the user (but the netrc file can be used to store this
password, as described in the mh-profile(5) man page). The
<br>
-saslmech switch can be used to select a particular SASL
mechanism, and the -user switch can be used to select a
authorization userid to provide to SASL other than the
default. <br>
The credentials profile entry in the mh-profile(5) man page
describes the ways to supply a username and password.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If SASL authentication is
successful, nmh will attempt to negotiate a security layer
for session encryption. Encrypted data is labelled with
&lsquo;(encrypted)&rsquo; and &lsquo;(decrypted)&rsquo; when
<br>
viewing the SMTP transaction with the -snoop switch. The
-saslmaxssf switch can be used to select the maximum value
of the Security Strength Factor. This is an integer value
<br>
and the exact meaning of this value depends on the
underlying SASL mechanism. A value of 0 disables
encryption.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If nmh has been compiled with
TLS support, the -tls and -initialtls switches will require
the negotiation of TLS when connecting to the SMTP MTA. The
-tls switch will negotiate <br>
TLS as part of the normal SMTP protocol using the STARTTLS
command. The -initialtls will negotiate TLS immediately
after the connection has taken place, before any SMTP
commands <br>
are sent or received. Encrypted data is labelled with
&lsquo;(tls-encrypted)&rsquo; and
&lsquo;(tls-decrypted)&rsquo; when viewing the SMTP
transction with the -snoop switch. The -notls switch will
<br>
disable all attempts to negotiate TLS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The files specified by the
profile entry &acirc;Aliasfile:&acirc; and any additional
alias files given by the -alias aliasfile switch will be
read (more than one file, each preceded by <br>
-alias, can be named). See mh-alias(5) for more
information.</p>
