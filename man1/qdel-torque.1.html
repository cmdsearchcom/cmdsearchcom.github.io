<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
qdel - delete pbs batch job</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
qdel [-a] [-c] [-m message] [-p] [-t array_range] [-W delay]
job_identifier...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The qdel command deletes jobs in the order in which their
job identifiers are presented to the command. A job is
deleted by sending a Delete Job batch request to the batch
<br>
server that owns the job. A job that has been deleted is no
longer subject to management by batch services.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A batch job may be deleted by
its owner, the batch operator, or the batch
administrator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A batch job being deleted by a
server will be sent a SIGTERM signal following by a SIGKILL
signal. The time delay between the two signals is an
attribute of the execution queue <br>
from which the job was run (settable by the administrator).
This delay may be overridden by the -W option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See the PBS ERS section 3.1.3.3,
&quot;Delete Job Request&quot;, for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-W delay Specify the delay between the sending of the
SIGTERM and SIGKILL signals. The argument delay specifies a
unsigned integer number of seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a Request the job(s) be deleted
asynchronously, which for a Running job means that the reply
will return before the MOM is requested to delete the
job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Clean up unreported jobs from
the server. This should only be used if the scheduler is
unable to purge unreported jobs. This option is only
available to a batch <br>
operator or the batch administrator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p Forcibly purge the job from
the server. This should only be used if a running job will
not exit because its allocated nodes are unreachable. The
admin should <br>
make every attempt at resolving the problem on the nodes. If
a job&rsquo;s mother superior recovers after purging the
job, any epilogue scripts may still run. This <br>
option is only available to a batch operator or the batch
administrator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m message Specify a comment to
be included in the email. The argument message specifies the
comment to send. This option is only available to a batch
operator or the batch <br>
administrator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t array_range The array_range
argument is an integer id or a range of integers. Multiple
ids or id ranges can be combined in a comma delimted list.
Examples: -t 1-100 or -t <br>
1,10,50-100</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If an array range isn&rsquo;t
specified, the command tries to operate on the entire array.
The command acts on the array (or specified range of the
array) just as it <br>
would on an individual job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERANDS <br>
The qdel command accepts one or more job_identifier operands
of the form: <br>
sequence_number[.server_name][@server] <br>
or <br>
&rsquo;all&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STANDARD ERROR <br>
The qdel command will write a diagnostic messages to
standard error for each error occurrence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
Upon successful processing of all the operands presented to
the qdel command, the exit status will be a value of
zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the qdel command fails to
process any operand, the command exits with a value greater
than zero.</p>
