<p>ddr_lzo(1) LZO de/compression plugin for dd_rescue
ddr_lzo(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ddr_lzo - Data de/compression plugin for dd_rescue</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
-L lzo[=option[:option[:...]]] <br>
or <br>
-L /path/to/libddr_lzo.so[=option[:option[:...]]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
About <br>
LZO is an algorithm that de/compresses data. It is tuned for
speed (especially decompression speed) and trades the size
of the compressed file for it to some degree. There are <br>
variants with slow compression (yet still very fast
decompression) available though. See the algorithm parameter
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This plugin has been written for
dd_rescue and uses the plugin interface from it. See the
dd_rescue(1) man page for more information on dd_rescue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Options are passed using dd_rescue option passing syntax:
The name of the plugin (lzo) is optionally followed by an
equal sign (=) and options are separated by a colon (:). the
<br>
lzo plugin also allows for most options to be abbreviated to
five or six letters. See the EXAMPLES section below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Compression or decompression
<br>
The lzo dd_rescue plugin (subsequently referred to as just
ddr_lzo which reflects the variable parts of the filename
libddr_lzo.so) choses compression or decompression mode <br>
automatically if one of the input/output files has an [lt]zo
suffix; otherwise you may specify compr[ess] or decom[press]
parameters on the command line. <br>
The parameter opt[imize] will tell ddr_lzo to do an
optimization pass after compression. This might speed up
decompression by a few percent when creating compressed data
with <br>
high compression levels and large block sizes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The plugin also supports the
parameter bench[mark] ; if it&rsquo;s specified, it will
output some information about CPU usage and resulting
compression or decompression bandwidth. (For <br>
small files, the numbers become meaningless due to jitter
and limited time resolution -- ddr_lzo will skip the output
if the numbers are very tiny.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">De/compression algorithm <br>
The lzo plugin supports a number of the (de)compression
algorithms from liblzo2. You can specify which one you want
to use by passing algo=XXX , where XXX can be lzo1x_1, <br>
lzo1x_1_15, lzo1x_999, lzo1x_1_11, lzo1x_1_12, lzo1y_1,
lzo1y_999, lzo1f_1, lzo1f_999, lzo1b_1 ... lzo1b_9,
lzo1b_99, lzo1b_999, lzo2a_999. Pass algo=help to get a list
of <br>
available algorithms. Consult the liblzo documentation for
more information on the algorithms. Note that only the first
three are supported by lzop (it can decompress the first
<br>
five though, as they&rsquo;re all handled by the same
decompression routine). <br>
The default (lzo1x_1) is a good choice for fast compression
and very fast decompression and ensures compatibility with
lzop. For higher compression you might want to chose <br>
lzo1x_999, which is very slow but lzop compatible or
lzo2a_999, which is twice as fast, but not compatible with
lzop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Debugging <br>
The debug flag will cause the ddr_lzo to output information
about blocks and other internal data. It&rsquo;s meant for
debugging purposes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally there is also a
flags=XXXX parameter. This sets the flags field in the
header (default is 0x03000403) and is used for testing only.
It is not sanity checked and you can <br>
easily set values that will break decompression or cause
ddr_lzo to abort. Really only use for development purposes
when you know meaning of the various bits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Error recovery <br>
On compression, when input bytes can&rsquo;t be read,
ddr_lzo will encode holes in the compressed output file --
these will be skipped over on decompression.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On decompression, erroneous
blocks can be detected by the checksums (most often) or by
the decompressor. The lzo plugin tries to continue in that
case if the block header that <br>
specifies de/compressed lengths is intact. It will then
result in a block being skipped over (hole) and the
decompression will be continued with the next block. This
avoids <br>
corrupt data to end up in the output file (or preexisting,
potentially good data there being overwritten). <br>
The behaviour can be modified by specifying the nodisc[ard]
option. When given, the decompressor&rsquo;s output (filled
up with zeros if too short for the block) will be written to
the <br>
output file. Even if we know that the data is incorrect,
with some luck, parts of the block may actually be
valid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the block headers are
corrupt, your situation is desperate, as you will have lost
the remainder of the file. To recover pieces after such a
block header corruption, ddr_lzo <br>
supports the search option. With it, the plugin will search
the input file (starting from the position given in
dd_rescue with -s) for data that looks like a block header
and if <br>
a valid looking header is found, it will start decompressing
from that position. (If you can&rsquo;t find the data you
look for, you might actually study the output generated with
the <br>
debug flag.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Supported dd_rescue features
<br>
dd_rescue supports appending to files with the -x/--extend
option. If ddr_lzo is loaded and the output file is an
existing .lzo file, the new data will be appended in the
format <br>
specified by the existing LZOP header. If the header does
not indicate a multipart (archive) file, the EOF marker will
be overwritten, so that a valid .lzo file is created. <br>
Otherwise a new part will be appended.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When dd_rescue can&rsquo;t read
data or a sizable amount of zero-filled data is found and
the -a/--sparse option is active, then dd_rescue will create
sparse files (files with holes <br>
inside). This is an optimization to save space -- the holes
are interpreted as zeroes again on normal reads, so this is
transparent. The holes also can be useful to ensure that
<br>
good data is not overwritten with zeroes when data
couldn&rsquo;t be read. <br>
When the lzo module gets fed holes in compression mode, it
will encode them in the compressed output file in a special
way (using lzop multipart feature, as lzop unfortunately
<br>
chokes on blocks with 0 compressed length). On
decompression, the holes will result in the data being
jumped over again (creating a hole in the output file, if no
data preexists <br>
at the location).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lzop compatibility <br>
The plugin uses the lzo1x_1 algorithm by default (just like
lzop does by default) and generates adler32 checksums to
allow detecting data corruption. The compressed files are
<br>
compatible with lzop and ddr_lzo should handle files
generated by lzop. <br>
Multipart (archive) files from lzop are decompressed to ONE
output file in the order they are stored. <br>
Multipart files created by the lzo plugin to encode holes
will be extracted to several files from lzop. The holes are
encoded in the filenames (with a sequence number and the
<br>
hole size up to 1TB; use the timestamp for huge holes), so a
proper assembly of the fragments is possible even without
ddr_lzo.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lzop only supports the lzo1x_
family of algorithms. If you chose another algorithm to
compress data with ddr_lzo, it will set the
needed_version_to_extract field in the <br>
resulting lzop file to ddr_lzo&rsquo;s own version (1.789)
to indicate incompatibility with lzop (as of 1.03). <br>
lzop by default uses block sizes of 256kiB (on Unix
systems), but supports de/compression with smaller block
sizes as well. It needs to be recompiled to support block
sizes up to <br>
a possible maximum of 64MiB. Thus staying below or at 256kiB
is recommended; even when lzop compatibility is no concern,
blocks larger than 16MiB are not recommended, see below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Blocksize considerations <br>
When decompressing, the (soft) block size chosen in
dd_rescue must be sufficient (at least half the size of the
blocksize used when compressing); if you chose too small
blocks, <br>
ddr_lzo will warn and exit. <br>
For compression, the chosen (soft)blocksize in dd_rescue
will determine the size of blocks to be fed to the
lzo??_?_compress() routines. Larger block sizes will
typically result <br>
in slightly better compression ratios, though the returns on
increasing the block size quickly diminish after 64k. <br>
The default from dd_rescue (128kiB) is a good choice. It is
NOT recommended to increase the block size too much -- when
an lzo file gets corrupted, at least one block will be <br>
lost; larger blocks result in larger damage. Also, blocks
larger than 16MiB will not work well with the error
tolerance features of ddr_lzo. Also note that blocks larger
than <br>
256kiB need recompilation of lzop if you want to be able to
use lzop to process the .lzo files; blocks larger than 64MiB
prevent decompression even with a recompiled lzop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS/LIMITATIONS <br>
Maturity <br>
The plugin is new as of dd_rescue 1.43. Do not yet rely on
data saved with ddr_lzo as the only backup for valuable
data. Also expect some changes to ddr_lzo in the not too
<br>
distant future. (This should not break the file format, as
we&rsquo;re following lzop ....) <br>
Compressed data is more sensitive to data corruption than
plain data. Note that the checksums (adler32 or crc32) in
the lzop file format do NOT allow to correct for errors;
they <br>
just allow a somewhat reliable detection of data corruption.
(Ideally, a 32bit checksum just misses 1 out of 2^32
corruptions; on small changes, crc32 comes a bit closer to
the <br>
ideal than adler32. You may pass the crc32 option to use
crc32 instead of adler32 checksums at the expense of some
speed -- unfortunately the crc32 polynomial for
lzop/gzip/... <br>
is not the crc32c polynomial that has hardware support on
many CPUs these days.) Also note that the checksums are NOT
cryptographic hashes; a malicious attacker can easily find
<br>
modifications of data that do not alter the checksums. Use
MD5 or better SHA-256/SHA-512 for ensuring integrity against
attackers. Use par2 or similar software to create error <br>
correcting codes (Reed-Solomon / Erasure Codes) if you want
to be able to recover data in face of corruption.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Security <br>
While care has been applied to check the result of memory
allocations ..., the decompressor code has not been audited
and only limited fuzzing has been applied to ensure
it&rsquo;s not <br>
vulnerable to malicious data -- be careful when you process
data from untrusted sources.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
dd_rescue -ptAL lzo=algo=lzo1x_1_15:compress,hash=alg=sha256
infile outfile <br>
compresses data from infile into outfile using the algorithm
lzo1x_1_15 and calculates the sha256 hash value of outfile.
outfile will have time stamp and access rights <br>
copied over from infile and it will be emptied before (if
the file happens to exist). The output file won&rsquo;t have
encoded holes; errors in the infile will result in
zeros.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dd_rescue -aL
MD5,lzo=compr:bench,MD5,lzo=decompress,MD5 infile infile2
<br>
will copy infile to infile2 compressing the data and
decompressing it again on the fly. It will output MD5 hashes
for the compressed data as well (though it&rsquo;s not
stored) <br>
and for the two infiles -- the output should be identical,
obviously. This command is rather artificial, used for
testing. The -a flag makes dd_rescue detect zero blocks <br>
and create holes, thus testing hole encoding (sparse files)
and decoding as well if the infile has sizable regions
filled with zeros.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dd_rescue -s1M -S0 -L
lzo=search,nodiscard infile.lzo outfile <br>
will search for a lzop block header in infile.lzo starting
at position 1MiB into the file and decompress the remainder
of the file. On finding corrupted blocks, it will <br>
still write the output from the decompressor to outfile.</p>
