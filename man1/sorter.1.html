<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
sorter - Sort files in an image into categories based on
file type</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
[-b size ] [-e] [-E] [-h] [-l] [-md5] [-s] [-sha1] [-U] [-v]
[-V] [-a hash_alert ] [-c config ] [-C config ] [-d dir ]
[-m mnt ] [-n nsrl_db ] [-x hash_exclude ] [-i imgtype] [-o
<br>
imgoffset] [-f fstype] image [image] [meta_addr]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
sorter is a Perl script that analyzes a file system to
organize the allocated and unallocated files by file type.
It runs the &rsquo;file&rsquo; command on each file and
organizes the files <br>
according to the rules in configuration files. Extension
mismatching is also done to identify &rsquo;hidden&rsquo;
files. One can also provide hash databases for files that
are known to be <br>
good and can be ignored and files that are known to be bad
and should be alerted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, the program uses the
configuration files in the directory where The Sleuth Kit
was installed. Those can be overruled with run-time options.
There is a standard <br>
configuration file for all file system types and then a
specific one for a given operating system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ARGUMENTS <br>
The required arguments are as follows. This will analyze one
or more images and either save the results in the
&rsquo;-d&rsquo; directory or list the results to STDOUT (if
&rsquo;-l&rsquo; is given).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d dir Specify the location of
where all files should be written. This includes the index
files and subdirectories if the &rsquo;-s&rsquo; flag is
given. This MUST be given, unless the <br>
&rsquo;-l&rsquo; list flag is given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l List information to STDOUT
(no files are ever written). This is useful for Incident
Response, with the use of &rsquo;netcat&rsquo;. This cannot
be used if &rsquo;-d&rsquo; is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">image [images] <br>
The disk or partition image to read, whose format is given
with &rsquo;-i&rsquo;. Multiple image file names can be
given if the image is split into multiple segments. If only
one <br>
image file is given, and its name is the first in a sequence
(e.g., as indicated by ending in &rsquo;.001&rsquo;),
subsequent image segments will be included
automatically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The options are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f fstype <br>
Specify the file system type of the image(s). This is the
same type that The Sleuth Kit uses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i imgtype <br>
Specify the image type in which the file system is located.
This is the same type that The Sleuth Kit uses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o imgoffset <br>
Specify the sector offset from the beginning of the image to
the start of the file system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b size <br>
Specify the minimum size of file to process. All files less
than this size will be ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c config <br>
Specify the location of an additional configuration file.
This file will be loaded in addition to the standard ones in
the install directory. These settings will have <br>
priority over the standard files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C config <br>
Specify the location of the ONLY configuration file. The
standard config files will not be loaded if this option is
given. For example, in the
&Acirc;&acute;share/sort&Acirc;&acute; directory <br>
there is a file called &rsquo;images.sort&rsquo;. This file
contains only rules about graphic images. If it is specified
with -C, then only images will be saved about the image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m mnt Specify the mounting
point of the image being analyzed. This is only for cosmetic
reasons. When the entries in the output files are written,
the files will have a the <br>
full path instead of just the relative path. If this is
given, then only one image can be given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a hash_alert <br>
Specify the location a hash database with entries of known
&rsquo;bad&rsquo; files. If any file is found with an MD5
hash value in this database, it will be placed in a special
alert <br>
file. This database must have been indexed for MD5 using
&rsquo;hfind&rsquo; in The Sleuth Kit before it is used by
sorter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n nsrl_db <br>
Specify the location of the NIST National Software Reference
Library (NSRL) database (www.nsrl.nist.org). Any file found
in the NSRL will be ignored and not placed into a <br>
category. The database must be indexed for MD5 with
&rsquo;hfind&rsquo; in The Sleuth Kit before it is used by
sorter. The database file is currently called
&rsquo;NSRLFile.txt&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x hash_exclude <br>
Specify the location a hash database with entries of known
&rsquo;good&rsquo; files. If any file is found with an MD5
hash value in this database, it will be ignored and not
pro&acirc; <br>
cessed or saved to the category files. This database must
have been indexed for MD5 using &rsquo;hfind&rsquo; in The
Sleuth Kit before it is used by sorter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e Perform extension mismatch
checks on (no category index files are generated)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U Do no save data about unknown
file types. By default, an &rsquo;unknown&rsquo; file is
created for files where the &rsquo;file&rsquo; output is not
known. This allows one to refine their con&acirc; <br>
figuration. If this is not desired, use this flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Create category files in
HTML</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-md5 Calculate the MD5 value for
each file and save it in the category file. This will be
done automatically when any of the databases are given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sha1 Calculate the SHA-1 value
for each file and save it in the category file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Save the actual file content
to sub-directories in the directory specified by
&rsquo;-d&rsquo;. For example, all JPG and GIF files would
actually be saved in the &rsquo;images&rsquo; directory.
<br>
If &rsquo;-h&rsquo; is also given, thumbnails of graphic
images are also created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Display verbose
information</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Display version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[meta_addr] <br>
The meta data address of the directory to start with. By
default, the root directory is used. If this is given, then
only one image can be given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HIGH-LEVEL OVERVIEW OF PROCESS
<br>
sorter is a Perl script that interacts with other The Sleuth
Kit tools. It starts by reading the configuration files from
the installation directory. There is a general config&acirc;
<br>
uration file and a specific one for each operating system.
The specific one is determined from the &rsquo;-f&rsquo;
flag. Each configuration file contains rules for processing
the output <br>
of the &rsquo;file&rsquo; command. One type of line
identifies which category (i.e. &rsquo;images&rsquo;) a
given &rsquo;file&rsquo; output belongs to (i.e.
&Acirc;&acute;image data&Acirc;&acute;) (using regular
expressions). Another <br>
rule shows the file extensions (i.e. .txt) that belong to a
&rsquo;file&rsquo; output (i.e. ASCII(.*?)text). See the
Rules section below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The program then runs the
&rsquo;fls&rsquo; tool in The Sleuth Kit to identify the
files in the file system image. Each identified file is
viewed using the &rsquo;icat&rsquo; tool. If a hash database
<br>
is given, the hash of the file is calculated and looked up.
If it is found in an &rsquo;alert&rsquo; database, then it
is added to a special &rsquo;alert.txt&rsquo; file. If it is
found in the NSRL or <br>
&rsquo;exclude&rsquo; database, then it is ignored as a
known good file. Excluded files are recorded in an
&rsquo;exclude&rsquo; file for future reference but it is
not saved in the category files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &rsquo;file&rsquo; command
is then run to identify the file type (based on header
information). The configuration file rules are used to
identify which category it belongs to. An entry <br>
is added to the corresponding category file (in the
&rsquo;-d dir&rsquo; directory). If the &rsquo;-s&rsquo;
flag is given, then a copy of the file is saved in a
subdirectory of the same name as the <br>
category. If the HTML format is used, then hyper-links will
allow one to easily view saved files and view what is in
each category.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Files that do not have a
category are recorded in the &rsquo;unknown&rsquo; category
and the &rsquo;data&rsquo; category. &rsquo;data&rsquo; is
for files with a structure that &rsquo;file&rsquo; does not
know and &rsquo;unknown&rsquo; is <br>
for files with a structure that &rsquo;file&rsquo; knows
about. These are saved for future reference, but the unknown
category can be ignored by using the &rsquo;-U&rsquo;
flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A copy of the files can be saved
by using the &rsquo;-s&rsquo; flag. If so, then the files
are saved in a subdirectory that is named with the category
name. Each file is named using the <br>
file system image name followed by the meta data address and
the original file extension. The category index file can be
used to translate the actual name to the saved name. <br>
The HTML format makes viewing easier as there are links to
each file from the category index file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The program will also consult
the rules about the file extension. If the file has an
extension at the end of it (anything after a
&Acirc;&acute;.&Acirc;&acute;), it will be compared to the
rules. If the <br>
extension is not found in the rules as a valid extension for
the file type, it will be added to the file of
&rsquo;mismatch&rsquo;. If the file does not have an
extension it will not be <br>
entered even if the file type has valid extensions. This
check is done even if the file is found in one of the known
good hash databases. If it is found in one of those, it <br>
will be added to a special file. Files of type
&rsquo;data&rsquo; have no extension checks done by default
(as they have an unknown structure).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The program repeats the above
procedures using the output of the &rsquo;ils&rsquo; command
as well. This allows &rsquo;sorter&rsquo; to examine the
contents of unallocated files that still have point&acirc;
<br>
ers to the data units (not all file systems will produce
data from this step).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION FILES <br>
Configuration files are used to define what file types
belong in which categories and what extensions belong to
what file types. Configuration files are distributed with
the <br>
&rsquo;sorter&rsquo; tool and are located in the
installation directory in the &rsquo;share/sorter&rsquo;
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &rsquo;default.sort&rsquo;
file is used by any file system type. It contains entries
for common file types. A specific operating system file also
exists, which is useful for extensions <br>
that are specific to a given OS. By default, the default
file and the OS specific one will be used. Using the
&rsquo;-c&rsquo; flag, an additional file can be used. If
the &rsquo;-C&rsquo; flag is <br>
used, then only the supplied configuration file is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are two rule types in the
configuration files. Each rule starts with a header that
specifies which rule type it is (category or ext). Both rule
types have two additional <br>
columns that can be separated by any white space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The category rule has the
category name as the second column and a Perl regular
expression in the third column. The category name can not
have any spaces in it and can only be <br>
letters and numbers. The regular expression is used to
examine the output of &rsquo;file&rsquo;. The regular
expression will be used case insensitive. More than one rule
can exist for a <br>
category, but only one category can exist for a given file
output. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This saves all file output with
&rsquo;image data&rsquo; anywhere in it to the
&Acirc;&acute;images&Acirc;&acute; category: <br>
category images image data</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This saves all file output that
has &rsquo;ASCII&rsquo; followed by anything and then
&rsquo;text&rsquo; to be saved to the &rsquo;text&rsquo;
category: <br>
category text ASCII(.*?)text</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This saves all file output that
is just &rsquo;data&rsquo; to the &rsquo;data&rsquo;
category (the ^ and $ define the boundaries in Perl). The
&rsquo;data&rsquo; value is common in the output of file for
unknown <br>
binary data. <br>
category data ^data?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is a special category of
&rsquo;ignore&rsquo; that is used to skip over files of this
type. This is mainly a time and space saver.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The extension rule is similar
except that the second column has the value extensions for
the file output. Multiple rules can exist for the same file
type. The comparison will <br>
be done case insensitive. If no extension is valid for the
file type, a rule does not need to be made. That is already
assumed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, the ASCII is used
for several file extensions so the following rules could
exist:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ext txt,log ASCII(.*?)text <br>
ext c,cpp,h,js ASCII(.*?)text</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please email me any rules that
you find useful for standard investigations and I will
incorporate them into future releases (carrier at sleuthkit
dot org).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
To run sorter with no hash databases, the following can be
used:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># sorter -f ntfs -d data/sorter
images/hda1.dd <br>
# sorter -d data/sorter images/hda1.dd</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># sorter -i raw -f ntfs -o 63 -d
data/sorter images/hda.dd</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To include the NSRL, an exclude,
and an alert hash database:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># sorter -f ntfs -d data/sorter
-a /usr/hash/rootkit.db -x /usr/hash/win2k.db -n
/usr/hash/nsrl/NSRLFile.txt images/hda1.dd</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To just identify images using
the supplied &rsquo;images.sort&rsquo; file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># sorter -f ntfs -C
/usr/local/sleuthkit/share/sort/images.sort -d data/sorter
-h -s images/hda1.dd</p>
