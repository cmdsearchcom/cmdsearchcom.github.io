<b>sorter</b> is a Perl script that analyzes a file system to organize the
  allocated and unallocated files by file type. It runs the 'file' command on
  each file and organizes the files according to the rules in configuration
  files. Extension mismatching is also done to identify 'hidden' files. One can
  also provide hash databases for files that are known to be good and can be
  ignored and files that are known to be bad and should be alerted.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
By default, the program uses the configuration files in the directory where The
  Sleuth Kit was installed. Those can be overruled with run-time options. There
  is a standard configuration file for all file system types and then a specific
  one for a given operating system.

  OVERVIEW OF PROCESS</a></h1>
<b>sorter</b> is a Perl script that interacts with other The Sleuth Kit tools.
  It starts by reading the configuration files from the installation directory.
  There is a general configuration file and a specific one for each operating
  system. The specific one is determined from the '-f' flag. Each configuration
  file contains rules for processing the output of the 'file' command. One type
  of line identifies which category (i.e. 'images') a given 'file' output
  belongs to (i.e. &#x00B4;image data&#x00B4;) (using regular expressions).
  Another rule shows the file extensions (i.e. .txt) that belong to a 'file'
  output (i.e. ASCII(.*?)text). See the Rules section below.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The program then runs the 'fls' tool in The Sleuth Kit to identify the files in
  the file system image. Each identified file is viewed using the 'icat' tool.
  If a hash database is given, the hash of the file is calculated and looked up.
  If it is found in an 'alert' database, then it is added to a special
  'alert.txt' file. If it is found in the NSRL or 'exclude' database, then it is
  ignored as a known good file. Excluded files are recorded in an 'exclude' file
  for future reference but it is not saved in the category files.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The 'file' command is then run to identify the file type (based on header
  information). The configuration file rules are used to identify which category
  it belongs to. An entry is added to the corresponding category file (in the
  '-d dir' directory). If the '-s' flag is given, then a copy of the file is
  saved in a subdirectory of the same name as the category. If the HTML format
  is used, then hyper-links will allow one to easily view saved files and view
  what is in each category.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Files that do not have a category are recorded in the 'unknown' category and the
  'data' category. 'data' is for files with a structure that 'file' does not
  know and 'unknown' is for files with a structure that 'file' knows about.
  These are saved for future reference, but the unknown category can be ignored
  by using the '-U' flag.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
A copy of the files can be saved by using the '-s' flag. If so, then the files
  are saved in a subdirectory that is named with the category name. Each file is
  named using the file system image name followed by the meta data address and
  the original file extension. The category index file can be used to translate
  the actual name to the saved name. The HTML format makes viewing easier as
  there are links to each file from the category index file.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The program will also consult the rules about the file extension. If the file
  has an extension at the end of it (anything after a &#x00B4;.&#x00B4;), it
  will be compared to the rules. If the extension is not found in the rules as a
  valid extension for the file type, it will be added to the file of 'mismatch'.
  If the file does not have an extension it will not be entered even if the file
  type has valid extensions. This check is done even if the file is found in one
  of the known good hash databases. If it is found in one of those, it will be
  added to a special file. Files of type 'data' have no extension checks done by
  default (as they have an unknown structure).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The program repeats the above procedures using the output of the 'ils' command
  as well. This allows 'sorter' to examine the contents of unallocated files
  that still have pointers to the data units (not all file systems will produce
  data from this step).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CONFIGURATION_FILES"><a class="selflink" href="#CONFIGURATION_FILES">CONFIGURATION
  FILES</a></h1>
Configuration files are used to define what file types belong in which
  categories and what extensions belong to what file types. Configuration files
  are distributed with the 'sorter' tool and are located in the installation
  directory in the 'share/sorter' directory.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The 'default.sort' file is used by any file system type. It contains entries for
  common file types. A specific operating system file also exists, which is
  useful for extensions that are specific to a given OS. By default, the default
  file and the OS specific one will be used. Using the '-c' flag, an additional
  file can be used. If the '-C' flag is used, then only the supplied
  configuration file is used.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
There are two rule types in the configuration files. Each rule starts with a
  header that specifies which rule type it is (category or ext). Both rule types
  have two additional columns that can be separated by any white space.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The category rule has the category name as the second column and a Perl regular
  expression in the third column. The category name can not have any spaces in
  it and can only be letters and numbers. The regular expression is used to
  examine the output of 'file'. The regular expression will be used case
  insensitive. More than one rule can exist for a category, but only one
  category can exist for a given file output. For example:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This saves all file output with 'image data' anywhere in it to the
  &#x00B4;images&#x00B4; category:
<br/>
 category images image data
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This saves all file output that has 'ASCII' followed by anything and then 'text'
  to be saved to the 'text' category:
<br/>
 category text ASCII(.*?)text
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This saves all file output that is just 'data' to the 'data' category (the ^ and
  $ define the boundaries in Perl). The 'data' value is common in the output of
  file for unknown binary data.
<br/>
 category data ^data?
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
There is a special category of 'ignore' that is used to skip over files of this
  type. This is mainly a time and space saver.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The extension rule is similar except that the second column has the value
  extensions for the file output. Multiple rules can exist for the same file
  type. The comparison will be done case insensitive. If no extension is valid
  for the file type, a rule does not need to be made. That is already assumed.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
For example, the ASCII is used for several file extensions so the following
  rules could exist:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 ext txt,log ASCII(.*?)text
<br/>
 ext c,cpp,h,js ASCII(.*?)text
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Please email me any rules that you find useful for standard investigations and I
  will incorporate them into future releases (carrier at sleuthkit dot org).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="EXAMPLES"><a class="selflink" href="#EXAMPLES">EXAMPLES</a></h1>
To run sorter with no hash databases, the following can be used:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 # sorter -f ntfs -d data/sorter images/hda1.dd 	
<br/>
 # sorter -d data/sorter images/hda1.dd
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 # sorter -i raw -f ntfs -o 63 -d data/sorter images/hda.dd
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
To include the NSRL, an exclude, and an alert hash database:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 # sorter -f ntfs -d data/sorter -a /usr/hash/rootkit.db 	 -x /usr/hash/win2k.db
  -n /usr/hash/nsrl/NSRLFile.txt 	 images/hda1.dd
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
To just identify images using the supplied 'images.sort' file:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 # sorter -f ntfs -C /usr/local/sleuthkit/share/sort/images.sort 	 -d
  data/sorter -h -s images/hda1.dd
