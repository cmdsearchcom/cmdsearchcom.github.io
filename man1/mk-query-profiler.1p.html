<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
mk-query-profiler - Execute SQL statements and print
statistics, or measure activity caused by other
processes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
Usage: mk-query-profiler [OPTION...] [FILE...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mk-query-profiler reads and
executes queries, and prints statistics about MySQL server
load. Connection options are read from MySQL option files.
If FILE is given, queries are <br>
read and executed from the file(s). With no FILE, or when
FILE is -, read standard input. If --external is specified,
lines in FILE are executed by the shell. You must specify
<br>
- if no FILE and you want --external to read and execute
from standard input. Queries in FILE must be terminated with
a semicolon and separated by a blank line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mk-query-profiler can profile
the (semicolon-terminated, blank-line separated) queries in
a file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mk-query-profiler queries.sql
<br>
cat queries.sql | mk-query-profiler <br>
mk-query-profiler -vv queries.sql <br>
mk-query-profiler -v --separate --only 2,5,6 queries.sql
<br>
mk-query-profiler --tab queries.sql &gt; results.csv</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It can also just observe what
happens in the server:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mk-query-profiler --external</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Or it can run shell commands
from a file and measure the result:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mk-query-profiler --external
commands.txt <br>
mk-query-profiler --external - &lt; commands.txt</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Read &quot;HOW TO
INTERPRET&quot; to learn what it all means.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RISKS <br>
The following section is included to inform users about the
potential risks, whether known or unknown, of using this
tool. The two main categories of risks are those created by
<br>
the nature of the tool (e.g. read-only tools vs. read-write
tools) and those created by bugs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mk-query-profiler is generally
read-only and very low risk. It will execute FLUSH TABLES if
you specify &quot;--flush&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At the time of this release, we
know of no bugs that could cause serious harm to users.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The authoritative source for
updated information is always the online issue tracking
system. Issues that affect this tool will be marked as such.
You can see a list of such <br>
issues at the following URL:
&lt;http://www.maatkit.org/bugs/mk-query-profiler&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See also &quot;BUGS&quot; for
more information on filing bugs and getting help.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
mk-query-profiler reads a file containing one or more SQL
statements or shell commands, executes them, and analyzes
the output of SHOW STATUS afterwards. It then prints <br>
statistics about how the batch performed. For example, it
can show how many table scans the batch caused, how many
page reads, how many temporary tables, and so forth.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All command-line arguments are
optional, but you must either specify a file containing the
batch to profile as the last argument, or specify that
you&rsquo;re profiling an external <br>
program with the &quot;--external&quot; option, or provide
input to STDIN.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the file contains multiple
statements, they must be separated by blank lines. If you
don&rsquo;t do that, mk-query-profiler won&rsquo;t be able
to split the file into individual queries, <br>
and MySQL will complain about syntax errors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the MySQL server version is
before 5.0.2, you should make sure the server is completely
unused before trying to profile a batch. Prior to this
version, SHOW STATUS showed <br>
only global status variables, so other queries will
interfere and produce false results. mk-query-profiler will
try to detect if anything did interfere, but there can be no
<br>
guarantees.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Prior to MySQL 5.0.2, InnoDB
status variables are not available, and prior to version
5.0.3, InnoDB row lock status variables are not available.
mk-query-profiler will omit any <br>
output related to these variables if they&rsquo;re not
available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For more information about SHOW
STATUS, read the relevant section of the MySQL manual at
&lt;http://dev.mysql.com/doc/en/server-status-variables.html&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOW TO INTERPRET <br>
TAB-SEPARATED OUTPUT <br>
If you specify &quot;--tab&quot;, you will get the raw
output of SHOW STATUS in tab-separated format, convenient
for opening with a spreadsheet. This is not the default
output, but it&rsquo;s <br>
so much easier to describe that I&rsquo;ll cover it
first.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Most of the
command-line options for controlling verbosity and such are
ignored in --tab mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The variable
names you see in MySQL, such as &rsquo;Com_select&rsquo;,
are kept -- there are no euphimisms, so you have to know
your MySQL variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The columns are
Variable_name, Before, After1...AfterN, Calibration. The
Variable_name column is just what it sounds like. Before is
the result from the first run of SHOW <br>
STATUS. After1, After2, etc are the results of running SHOW
STATUS after each query in the batch. Finally, the last
column is the result of running SHOW STATUS just after <br>
the last AfterN column, so you can see how much work SHOW
STATUS itself causes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If you specify
&quot;--verbose&quot;, output includes every variable
mk-query-profiler measures. If not (default) it only
includes variables where there was some difference from one
<br>
column to the next.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NORMAL OUTPUT <br>
If you don&rsquo;t specify --tab, you&rsquo;ll get a report
formatted for human readability. This is the default output
format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mk-query-profiler can output a
lot of information, as you&rsquo;ve seen if you ran the
examples in the &quot;SYNOPSIS&quot;. What does it all
mean?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">First, there are two basic
groups of information you might see: per-query and summary.
If your batch contains only one query, these will be the
same and you&rsquo;ll only see the <br>
summary. You can recognize the difference by looking for
centered, all-caps, boxed-in section headers. Externally
profiled commands will have EXTERNAL, individually profiled
<br>
queries will have QUERY, and summary will say SUMMARY.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Next, the information in each
section is grouped into subsections, headed by an underlined
title. Each of these sections has varying information in it.
Which sections you see <br>
depends on command-line arguments and your MySQL version.
I&rsquo;ll explain each section briefly. If you really want
to know where the numbers come from, read <br>

&lt;http://dev.mysql.com/doc/en/server-status-variables.html&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You need to understand which
numbers are insulated from other queries and which are not.
This depends on your MySQL version. Version 5.0.2 introduced
the concept of session <br>
status variables, so you can see information about only your
own connection. However, many variables aren&rsquo;t
session-ized, so when you have MySQL 5.0.2 or greater, you
will <br>
actually see a mix of session and global variables. That
means other queries happening at the same time will pollute
some of your results. If you have MySQL versions older than
<br>
5.0.2, you won&rsquo;t have ANY connection-specific stats,
so your results will be polluted by other queries no matter
what. Because of the mixture of session and global
variables, by <br>
far the best way to profile is on a completely quiet server
where nothing else is interfering with your results.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">While explaining the results in
the sections that follow, I&rsquo;ll refer to a value as
&quot;protected&quot; if it comes from a session-specific
variable and can be relied upon to be accurate <br>
even on a busy server. Just keep in mind, if you&rsquo;re
not using MySQL 5.0.2 or newer, your results will be
inaccurate unless you&rsquo;re running against a totally
quiet server, even if <br>
I label it as &quot;protected.&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Overall stats <br>
This section shows the overall elapsed time for the query,
as measured by Perl, and the optimizer cost as reported by
MySQL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you&rsquo;re viewing separate
query statistics, this is all you&rsquo;ll see. If
you&rsquo;re looking at a summary, you&rsquo;ll also see a
breakdown of the questions the queries asked the server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The execution time is not
totally reliable, as it includes network round-trip time,
Perl&rsquo;s own execution time, and so on. However, on a
low-latency network, this should be <br>
fairly negligible, giving you a reasonable measure of the
query&rsquo;s time, especially for queries longer than a few
tenths of a second.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The optimizer cost comes from
the Last_query_cost variable, and is protected from other
connections in MySQL 5.0.7 and greater. It is not available
before 5.0.1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The total number of questions is
not protected, but the breakdown of individual question
types is, because it comes from the Com_ status
variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Table and index accesses <br>
This section shows you information about the batch&rsquo;s
table and index-level operations (as opposed to row-level
operations, which will be in the next section). The
&quot;Table locks <br>
acquired&quot; and &quot;Temp files&quot; values are
unprotected, but everything else in this section is
protected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;Potential
filesorts&quot; value is calculated as the number of times a
query had both a scan sort (Sort_scan) and created a
temporary table (Created_tmp_tables). There is no <br>
Sort_filesort or similar status value, so it&rsquo;s a best
guess at whether a query did a filesort. It should be fairly
accurate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you specified
&quot;--allow-cache&quot;, you&rsquo;ll see statistics on
the query cache. These are unprotected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Row operations <br>
These values are all about the row-level operations your
batch caused. For example, how many rows were inserted,
updated, or deleted. You&rsquo;ll also see row-level index
access <br>
statistics, such as how many times the query sought and read
the next entry in an index.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Depending on your MySQL version,
you&rsquo;ll either see one or two columns of information in
this section. The one headed &quot;Handler&quot; is all from
the Handler_ variables, and those <br>
statistics are protected. If your MySQL version supports it,
you&rsquo;ll also see a column headed &quot;InnoDB,&quot;
which is unprotected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">I/O Operations <br>
This section gives information on I/O operations your batch
caused, both in memory and on disk. Unless you have MySQL
5.0.2 or greater, you&rsquo;ll only see information on the
key <br>
cache. Otherwise, you&rsquo;ll see a lot of information on
InnoDB&rsquo;s I/O operations as well, such as how many
times the query was able to satisfy a read from the buffer
pool and how <br>
many times it had to go to the disk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">None of the information in this
section is protected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">InnoDB Data Operations <br>
This section only appears when you&rsquo;re querying MySQL
5.0.2 or newer. None of the information is protected.
You&rsquo;ll see statistics about how many pages were
affected, how many <br>
operations took place, and how many bytes were affected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
This tool accepts additional command-line arguments. Refer
to the &quot;SYNOPSIS&quot; and usage information for
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--allow-cache <br>
Let MySQL query cache cache the queries executed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default this is disabled.
When enabled, cache profiling information is added to the
printout. See
&lt;http://dev.mysql.com/doc/en/query-cache.html&gt; for
more information <br>
about the query cache.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ask-pass <br>
Prompt for a password when connecting to MySQL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--[no]calibrate <br>
default: yes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Try to compensate for &quot;SHOW
STATUS&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Measure and compensate for the
&quot;cost of observation&quot; caused by running SHOW
STATUS. Only works reliably on a quiet server; on a busy
server, other processes can cause the <br>
calibration to be wrong.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--charset <br>
short form: -A; type: string</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default character set. If the
value is utf8, sets Perl&rsquo;s binmode on STDOUT to utf8,
passes the mysql_enable_utf8 option to DBD::mysql, and runs
SET NAMES UTF8 after <br>
connecting to MySQL. Any other value sets binmode on STDOUT
without the utf8 layer, and runs SET NAMES after connecting
to MySQL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--config <br>
type: Array</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Read this comma-separated list
of config files; if specified, this must be the first option
on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--database <br>
short form: -D; type: string</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Database to use for
connection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--defaults-file <br>
short form: -F; type: string</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Only read mysql options from the
given file. You must give an absolute pathname.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--external <br>
Calibrate, then pause while an external program runs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is typically useful while
you run an external program. When you press [enter]
mk-query-profiler will stop sleeping and take another
measurement, then print statistics <br>
as usual.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When there is a filename on the
command line, mk-query-profiler executes each line in the
file as a shell command. If you give - as the filename,
mk-query-profiler reads <br>
from STDIN.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Output from shell commands is
printed to STDOUT and terminated with __BEGIN__, after which
mk-query-profiler prints its own output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--flush <br>
cumulative: yes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Flush tables. Specify twice to
do between every query.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Calls FLUSH TABLES before
profiling. If you are executing queries from a batch file,
specifying --flush twice will cause mk-query-profiler to
call FLUSH TABLES between every <br>
query, not just once at the beginning. Default is not to
flush at all. See
&lt;http://dev.mysql.com/doc/en/flush.html&gt; for more
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help <br>
Show help and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--host <br>
short form: -h; type: string</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Connect to host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--[no]innodb <br>
default: yes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Show InnoDB statistics.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--only <br>
type: hash</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Only show statistics for this
comma-separated list of queries or commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--password <br>
short form: -p; type: string</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Password to use when
connecting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--pid <br>
type: string</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Create the given PID file. The
file contains the process ID of the script. The PID file is
removed when the script exits. Before starting, the script
checks if the PID <br>
file already exists. If it does not, then the script creates
and writes its own PID to it. If it does, then the script
checks the following: if the file contains a PID and <br>
a process is running with that PID, then the script dies;
or, if there is no process running with that PID, then the
script overwrites the file with its own PID and starts; <br>
else, if the file contains no PID, then the script dies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--port <br>
short form: -P; type: int</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Port number to use for
connection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--separate <br>
Print stats separately for each query.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is to show only the
summary of the entire batch. See also
&quot;--verbose&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--[no]session <br>
default: yes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use session &quot;SHOW
STATUS&quot; and &quot;SHOW VARIABLES&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Disabled if the server version
doesn&rsquo;t support it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--set-vars <br>
type: string; default: wait_timeout=10000</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Set these MySQL variables.
Immediately after connecting to MySQL, this string will be
appended to SET and executed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--socket <br>
short form: -S; type: string</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Socket file to use for
connection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--tab <br>
Print tab-separated values instead of whitespace-aligned
columns.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--user <br>
short form: -u; type: string</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">User for login if not current
user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--verbose <br>
short form: -v; cumulative: yes; default: 0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Verbosity; specify multiple
times for more detailed output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When &quot;--tab&quot; is given,
prints variables that don&rsquo;t change. Otherwise
increasing the level of verbosity includes extra sections in
the output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--verify <br>
Verify nothing else is accessing the server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is a weak verification; it
simply calibrates twice (see &quot;--[no]calibrate&quot;)
and verifies that the cost of observation remains
constant.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Show version and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DSN OPTIONS <br>
These DSN options are used to create a DSN. Each option is
given like &quot;option=value&quot;. The options are
case-sensitive, so P and p are not the same option. There
cannot be <br>
whitespace before or after the &quot;=&quot; and if the
value contains whitespace it must be quoted. DSN options are
comma-separated. See the maatkit manpage for full
details.</p>
