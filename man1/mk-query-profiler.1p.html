mk-query-profiler - Execute SQL statements and print statistics, or measure
  activity caused by other processes.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
Usage: mk-query-profiler [OPTION...] [FILE...]
<div class="Pp"></div>
mk-query-profiler reads and executes queries, and prints statistics about MySQL
  server load. Connection options are read from MySQL option files. If FILE is
  given, queries are read and executed from the file(s). With no FILE, or when
  FILE is -, read standard input. If --external is specified, lines in FILE are
  executed by the shell. You must specify - if no FILE and you want --external
  to read and execute from standard input. Queries in FILE must be terminated
  with a semicolon and separated by a blank line.
<div class="Pp"></div>
mk-query-profiler can profile the (semicolon-terminated, blank-line separated)
  queries in a file:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   mk-query-profiler queries.sql
   cat queries.sql | mk-query-profiler
   mk-query-profiler -vv queries.sql
   mk-query-profiler -v --separate --only 2,5,6 queries.sql
   mk-query-profiler --tab queries.sql &gt; results.csv
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
It can also just observe what happens in the server:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   mk-query-profiler --external
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Or it can run shell commands from a file and measure the result:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   mk-query-profiler --external commands.txt
   mk-query-profiler --external - &lt; commands.txt
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="RISKS"><a class="selflink" href="#RISKS">RISKS</a></h1>
The following section is included to inform users about the potential risks,
  whether known or unknown, of using this tool. The two main categories of risks
  are those created by the nature of the tool (e.g. read-only tools vs.
  read-write tools) and those created by bugs.
<div class="Pp"></div>
mk-query-profiler is generally read-only and very low risk. It will execute
  FLUSH TABLES if you specify &quot;--flush&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
At the time of this release, we know of no bugs that could cause serious harm to
  users.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The authoritative source for updated information is always the online issue
  tracking system. Issues that affect this tool will be marked as such. You can
  see a list of such issues at the following URL:
  &lt;http://www.maatkit.org/bugs/mk-query-profiler&gt;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
See also &quot;BUGS&quot; for more information on filing bugs and getting help.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
mk-query-profiler reads a file containing one or more SQL statements or shell
  commands, executes them, and analyzes the output of SHOW STATUS afterwards. It
  then prints statistics about how the batch performed. For example, it can show
  how many table scans the batch caused, how many page reads, how many temporary
  tables, and so forth.
<div class="Pp"></div>
All command-line arguments are optional, but you must either specify a file
  containing the batch to profile as the last argument, or specify that you're
  profiling an external program with the &quot;--external&quot; option, or
  provide input to STDIN.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the file contains multiple statements, they must be separated by blank lines.
  If you don't do that, mk-query-profiler won't be able to split the file into
  individual queries, and MySQL will complain about syntax errors.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the MySQL server version is before 5.0.2, you should make sure the server is
  completely unused before trying to profile a batch. Prior to this version,
  SHOW STATUS showed only global status variables, so other queries will
  interfere and produce false results. mk-query-profiler will try to detect if
  anything did interfere, but there can be no guarantees.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Prior to MySQL 5.0.2, InnoDB status variables are not available, and prior to
  version 5.0.3, InnoDB row lock status variables are not available.
  mk-query-profiler will omit any output related to these variables if they're
  not available.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For more information about SHOW STATUS, read the relevant section of the MySQL
  manual at &lt;http://dev.mysql.com/doc/en/server-status-variables.html&gt;

If you specify &quot;--tab&quot;, you will get the raw output of SHOW STATUS in
  tab-separated format, convenient for opening with a spreadsheet. This is not
  the default output, but it's so much easier to describe that I'll cover it
  first.

      the results of running SHOW STATUS after each query in the batch. Finally,
      the last column is the result of running SHOW STATUS just after the last
      AfterN column, so you can see how much work SHOW STATUS itself
    causes.</dd>

</dl>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="NORMAL_OUTPUT"><a class="selflink" href="#NORMAL_OUTPUT">NORMAL

If you don't specify --tab, you'll get a report formatted for human readability.
  This is the default output format.
<div class="Pp"></div>
mk-query-profiler can output a lot of information, as you've seen if you ran the
  examples in the &quot;SYNOPSIS&quot;. What does it all mean?
<div class="Pp"></div>
First, there are two basic groups of information you might see: per-query and
  summary. If your batch contains only one query, these will be the same and
  you'll only see the summary. You can recognize the difference by looking for
  centered, all-caps, boxed-in section headers. Externally profiled commands
  will have EXTERNAL, individually profiled queries will have QUERY, and summary
  will say SUMMARY.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Next, the information in each section is grouped into subsections, headed by an
  underlined title. Each of these sections has varying information in it. Which
  sections you see depends on command-line arguments and your MySQL version.
  I'll explain each section briefly. If you really want to know where the
  numbers come from, read
  &lt;http://dev.mysql.com/doc/en/server-status-variables.html&gt;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You need to understand which numbers are insulated from other queries and which
  are not. This depends on your MySQL version. Version 5.0.2 introduced the
  concept of session status variables, so you can see information about only
  your own connection. However, many variables aren't session-ized, so when you
  have MySQL 5.0.2 or greater, you will actually see a mix of session and global
  variables. That means other queries happening at the same time will pollute
  some of your results. If you have MySQL versions older than 5.0.2, you won't
  have ANY connection-specific stats, so your results will be polluted by other
  queries no matter what. Because of the mixture of session and global
  variables, by far the best way to profile is on a completely quiet server
  where nothing else is interfering with your results.
<div class="Pp"></div>
While explaining the results in the sections that follow, I'll refer to a value
  as &quot;protected&quot; if it comes from a session-specific variable and can
  be relied upon to be accurate even on a busy server. Just keep in mind, if
  you're not using MySQL 5.0.2 or newer, your results will be inaccurate unless
  you're running against a totally quiet server, even if I label it as
  &quot;protected.&quot;
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Overall_stats"><a class="selflink" href="#Overall_stats">Overall
  stats</a></h2>
This section shows the overall elapsed time for the query, as measured by Perl,
  and the optimizer cost as reported by MySQL.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you're viewing separate query statistics, this is all you'll see. If you're
  looking at a summary, you'll also see a breakdown of the questions the queries
  asked the server.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The execution time is not totally reliable, as it includes network round-trip
  time, Perl's own execution time, and so on. However, on a low-latency network,
  this should be fairly negligible, giving you a reasonable measure of the
  query's time, especially for queries longer than a few tenths of a second.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The optimizer cost comes from the Last_query_cost variable, and is protected
  from other connections in MySQL 5.0.7 and greater. It is not available before
  5.0.1.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The total number of questions is not protected, but the breakdown of individual
  question types is, because it comes from the Com_ status variables.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Table_and_index_accesses"><a class="selflink" href="#Table_and_index_accesses">Table
  and index accesses</a></h2>
This section shows you information about the batch's table and index-level
  operations (as opposed to row-level operations, which will be in the next
  section). The &quot;Table locks acquired&quot; and &quot;Temp files&quot;
  values are unprotected, but everything else in this section is protected.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The &quot;Potential filesorts&quot; value is calculated as the number of times a
  query had both a scan sort (Sort_scan) and created a temporary table
  (Created_tmp_tables). There is no Sort_filesort or similar status value, so
  it's a best guess at whether a query did a filesort. It should be fairly
  accurate.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you specified &quot;--allow-cache&quot;, you'll see statistics on the query
  cache. These are unprotected.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Row_operations"><a class="selflink" href="#Row_operations">Row
  operations</a></h2>
These values are all about the row-level operations your batch caused. For
  example, how many rows were inserted, updated, or deleted. You'll also see
  row-level index access statistics, such as how many times the query sought and
  read the next entry in an index.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Depending on your MySQL version, you'll either see one or two columns of
  information in this section. The one headed &quot;Handler&quot; is all from
  the Handler_ variables, and those statistics are protected. If your MySQL
  version supports it, you'll also see a column headed &quot;InnoDB,&quot; which
  is unprotected.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="I/O_Operations"><a class="selflink" href="#I/O_Operations">I/O
  Operations</a></h2>
This section gives information on I/O operations your batch caused, both in
  memory and on disk. Unless you have MySQL 5.0.2 or greater, you'll only see
  information on the key cache. Otherwise, you'll see a lot of information on
  InnoDB's I/O operations as well, such as how many times the query was able to
  satisfy a read from the buffer pool and how many times it had to go to the
  disk.
<div class="Pp"></div>
None of the information in this section is protected.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="InnoDB_Data_Operations"><a class="selflink" href="#InnoDB_Data_Operations">InnoDB
  Data Operations</a></h2>
This section only appears when you're querying MySQL 5.0.2 or newer. None of the
  information is protected. You'll see statistics about how many pages were
  affected, how many operations took place, and how many bytes were affected.

You can download Maatkit from Google Code at
  &lt;http://code.google.com/p/maatkit/&gt;, or you can get any of the tools
  easily with a command like the following:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   wget http://www.maatkit.org/get/toolname
   or
   wget http://www.maatkit.org/trunk/toolname
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Where &quot;toolname&quot; can be replaced with the name (or fragment of a name)
  of any of the Maatkit tools. Once downloaded, they're ready to run; no
  installation is needed. The first URL gets the latest released version of the
  tool, and the second gets the latest trunk code from Subversion.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ENVIRONMENT"><a class="selflink" href="#ENVIRONMENT">ENVIRONMENT</a></h1>
The environment variable &quot;MKDEBUG&quot; enables verbose debugging output in
  all of the Maatkit tools:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   MKDEBUG=1 mk-....
</pre>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYSTEM_REQUIREMENTS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYSTEM_REQUIREMENTS">SYSTEM
  REQUIREMENTS</a></h1>
You need Perl, DBI, DBD::mysql, and some core modules.

Please use Google Code Issues and Groups to report bugs or request support:
  &lt;http://code.google.com/p/maatkit/&gt;. You can also join #maatkit on
  Freenode to discuss Maatkit.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Please include the complete command-line used to reproduce the problem you are
  seeing, the version of all MySQL servers involved, the complete output of the
  tool when run with &quot;--version&quot;, and if possible, debugging output
  produced by running with the &quot;MKDEBUG=1&quot; environment variable.
