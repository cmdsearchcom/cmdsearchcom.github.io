These programs are used to compile and execute scripts written in the Q
  programming language. Q is an interpreted, dynamically typed functional
  programming language based on term rewriting which allows you to define
  functions using symbolic equations.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For instance, here is a little Q script featuring a recursive definition of the
  well-known factorial function:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
        fact 0 = 1;
        fact N = N*fact(N-1) if N&gt;0;
</pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This definition tells the interpreter that the term (function application) `fact
  0' should evaluate to the integer constant 1, while any other term `fact N'
  with N&gt;0 evaluates to the value of the expression N*fact(N-1).
<div class="Pp"></div>
A closer description of the language is well outside the scope of this manual
  page, but you can find some further notes about Q below, and you should also
  take a look at the Q info file (available online using <b>info qdoc</b> or
  with the <b>help</b> command of the interpreter) for details and many more
  examples.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The primary interface to the Q language is the interpreter program <b>q</b>. The
  <b>qc</b> program is a compiler for Q scripts which is usually invoked
  automatically by the interpreter to translate the source script to a bytecode
  format which is suitable for efficient execution. To run a script stored in a
  file <b>foo.q</b> you usually invoke the interpreter just as:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
        q foo.q
</pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
(The script name can also be followed by other parameters which are passed to
  the script and can be accessed through the built-in <b>ARGS</b> variable of
  the interpreter.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can also execute compiler and interpreter separately, like this:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
        qc foo.q
        q q.out
</pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The compiler will then compile the source script <b>foo.q</b> to the bytecode
  file <b>q.out</b> which can be loaded by the interpreter. Note that if you run
  a source script through the interpreter, then the compilation step is handled
  automatically and the bytecode file is removed automatically as soon as it has
  been loaded by the interpreter.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Both compiler and interpreter can also be invoked without arguments, or with an
  empty script name, in which case only the built-in functions and definitions
  in the script <b>prelude.q</b> (which by default includes the standard Q
  library) are loaded. The automatic inclusion of the prelude script can also be
  suppressed with the <b>--no-prelude</b> compiler option.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The script name can also be a single hyphen `<b>-</b>' to indicate that the
  script should be read from standard input.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Script and bytecode files are searched for on the ``Q library path'' which
  usually defaults to something like
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
        .:/usr/share/q/lib:/usr/lib/q
</pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
You can override this default by setting the <b>QPATH</b> environment variable,
  by using the <b>-p</b> command line option, and with the <b>path</b> command
  of the interpreter.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
Compiler and interpreter support both short and long (GNU style) options. A
  brief descriptive message showing the version number can be obtained with the
  <b>--version</b> or <b>-V</b> option. You can also invoke compiler and
  interpreter with the <b>--help</b> or <b>-h</b> option to print a summary of
  the command line syntax and the available options. Other important options are
  listed below (see the Q info file for more).
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>--</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Stops option processing (remaining parameters will be
      treated as ordinary command arguments even if they start with
    `<b>-</b>').</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-c</b><i> command</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Execute the given interpreter command (batch mode).</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-o</b><i> output-file</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Specify the name of the bytecode file created by the

<dl class="Bl-tag">

      This gives you a moderate level of confidence for small or medium-sized
      programs. <b>-w2</b> or <b>--pedantic</b> prints even more diagnostics,
      and might be useful for larger projects. <b>-w3</b> or <b>--paranoid</b>
      prints an excessive amount of diagnostics even for perfectly legal
      scripts. This is not intended to be used regularly, but may occasionally
      be useful to check your script for missing declarations or mistyped
      identifiers.</dd>
</dl>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="USAGE"><a class="selflink" href="#USAGE">USAGE</a></h1>
Unless one of the <b>-c</b> and <b>-s</b> options is specified, or if invoked
  with the <b>-i</b> option, the interpreter starts up in <i>interactive
  mode</i>, in which the user is repeatedly prompted to enter an expression to
  be evaluated, and the interpreter answers with the corresponding ``normal
  form.'' If the interpreter runs in interactive mode and is connected to a tty,
  the interpreter supports command line editing and history using the GNU
  readline library. The <b>quit</b> function causes the interpreter to be
  exited. End-of-file and <i>Ctl-C</i> are also handled (more or less)
  gracefully.
<div class="Pp"></div>
On the interactive command line, the value of the last expression can be
  referred to using the ``anonymous'' variable, denoted by an underscore (`_').
  Moreover, the interpreter understands a number of special commands which allow
  you to define variables, inspect and adjust various system parameters, edit
  and run scripts and command source files, read online info, load and save
  variables values, etc. Please refer to the Q info page for a description of
  these. You can also put such commands into the <b>.qinitrc</b> and
  <b>.qexitrc</b> files in your home directory which are sourced when the
  interpreter starts up and is exited in interactive mode, respectively. This
  provides a convenient means, e.g., to customize parameters of the interpreter
  according to your taste, and to automatically reload and save variable values.
<div class="Pp"></div>
On UNIX systems, you can also run Q scripts directly from the shell using the
  ``shebang'' <b>#!</b> to specify the <b>q</b> program as a command language
  processor. For instance, use the following as the first line of your script to
  invoke <b>q</b> with the option <b>-cfoo</b> which causes the function
  <b>foo</b> to be evaluated at startup:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
        #!/usr/local/bin/q -cfoo
</pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Such lines will be treated as comments by the compiler and interpreter. It is
  also possible to specify compiler and interpreter options at the beginning of
  the main script using the notation ` <b>#!</b> <i>option</i>'. For instance:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
        #!/usr/local/bin/q
        #! -w
        #! -cfoo
</pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Instead of directly running the script file, you can also use the <b>qcwrap</b>
  program to translate the script to a C file. This is useful if your shell does
  not support the <b>#!</b> notation, or if the script is to be distributed in a
  self-contained, binary form. The <b>qcwrap</b> program is available as an
  optional addon, see the Q info file for details.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DEBUGGING"><a class="selflink" href="#DEBUGGING">DEBUGGING</a></h1>
The <b>--debug</b> or <b>-d</b> option causes activation of a symbolic debugger
  built into the interpreter. The debugger can also be invoked interactively and
  you can set breakpoints using the <b>debug</b> and <b>break</b> commands on
  the command line. The debugger allows you to trace the reductions performed by
  the Q interpreter in the course of an expression evaluation. You can also step
  over reductions, abort the evaluation, and print a list of activated rules.
  Use the command <b>?</b> or <b>help</b> in the debugger to print a list of
  debugger commands.

  Q</a></h1>
Q may have started out as an academic research project, but it should not be
  mistaken for a toy language. Q has a modern syntax featuring both
  user-definable infix operators and curried function applications, and provides
  many goodies of modern-style functional languages, such as higher-order
  functions (including lambdas), support for both eager and lazy evaluation, and
  OOP-style polymorphic algebraic types. The Q interpreter goes to great lengths
  to implement term rewriting in an efficient manner, so that Q programs are
  executed reasonably fast, more or less comparable to other interpreted
  languages. Moreover, Q comes with an extensive software library, which makes
  it a practical programming tool and in many areas surpasses what is available
  for its bigger cousins like ML and Haskell.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The Q interpreter is extensible using ``external'' modules written in C or C++
  (which are loaded at runtime, if possible), and can itself be used as an
  extension language for other C/C++ applications. Q has a fairly complete POSIX
  system interface and a comprehensive collection of addon modules which
  interface to various popular open source software packages including, e.g.,
  GNU Octave, various GUI, graphics, multimedia, database and web-related
  libraries, and a module for the Apache web server. There is a language mode
  for <b>emacs</b>, which provides a convenient environment for editing and
  running Q scripts, and syntax files for the <b>vim</b> and <b>kate</b> text
  editors are also available. All this is described in much more detail in the Q
  info file and in the other documentation available on the Q website.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CAVEATS_AND_BUGS"><a class="selflink" href="#CAVEATS_AND_BUGS">CAVEATS
  AND BUGS</a></h1>
The only major issue I am aware of is memory requirements. The actual data of an
  expression node is only 12 bytes, but memory management, type tags and other
  book-keeping information sum up to another 12 bytes. There is no easy way
  around this in the current implementation, so don't expect this to change
  anytime soon. Fortunately, main memory gets cheaper and bigger all the time,
  so this should rarely be a problem in practice.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The Q interpreter uses a special pattern-matching technique to determine
  matching equations quickly and during a single left-to-right scan of each
  potential redex. This usually works very well, but there are some pathological
  configurations of left-hand sides of equations which cause an exponential
  blow-up of the tables of the pattern-matching automaton; fortunately, they are
  rare. You can tell that you have run into such a situation when the
  interpreter needs a long time to start up or appears to hang during bytecode
  compilation. The only way around this currently is to rewrite your script so
  that the amount of overlap between equations is reduced.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Another limitation of the current implementation is that special argument
  patterns and paths to left-hand side variables are currently encoded as bit
  vectors to save memory space. Thus functions cannot be declared with more than
  32 special parameters, and the left-hand side of a rule or local variable
  definition may not be more than 32 levels deep. There are also some hardcoded
  limits in the compiler for the sizes of the expression and code table for a
  single rule. The default table sizes are fairly large and, so far, this has
  never been a problem in practice. If you do run into an ``expression too
  complex'' or ``code table overflow'' error then it is probably time to
  restructure your program anyway. ;-)
