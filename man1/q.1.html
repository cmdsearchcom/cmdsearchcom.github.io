<p>Q(1) General Commands Manual Q(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
Q - The equational programming language</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
q [ options ] [ file | - ] [ argument ... ] <br>
qc [ options ] [ file | - ] ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
These programs are used to compile and execute scripts
written in the Q programming language. Q is an interpreted,
dynamically typed functional programming language based on
term <br>
rewriting which allows you to define functions using
symbolic equations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For instance, here is a little Q
script featuring a recursive definition of the well-known
factorial function:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fact 0 = 1; <br>
fact N = N*fact(N-1) if N&gt;0;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This definition tells the
interpreter that the term (function application) &lsquo;fact
0&rsquo; should evaluate to the integer constant 1, while
any other term &lsquo;fact N&rsquo; with N&gt;0 evaluates to
<br>
the value of the expression N*fact(N-1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A closer description of the
language is well outside the scope of this manual page, but
you can find some further notes about Q below, and you
should also take a look at the Q <br>
info file (available online using info qdoc or with the help
command of the interpreter) for details and many more
examples.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The primary interface to the Q
language is the interpreter program q. The qc program is a
compiler for Q scripts which is usually invoked
automatically by the interpreter to <br>
translate the source script to a bytecode format which is
suitable for efficient execution. To run a script stored in
a file foo.q you usually invoke the interpreter just as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">q foo.q</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(The script name can also be
followed by other parameters which are passed to the script
and can be accessed through the built-in ARGS variable of
the interpreter.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also execute compiler
and interpreter separately, like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">qc foo.q <br>
q q.out</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The compiler will then compile
the source script foo.q to the bytecode file q.out which can
be loaded by the interpreter. Note that if you run a source
script through the inter&acirc; <br>
preter, then the compilation step is handled automatically
and the bytecode file is removed automatically as soon as it
has been loaded by the interpreter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Both compiler and interpreter
can also be invoked without arguments, or with an empty
script name, in which case only the built-in functions and
definitions in the script pre&acirc; <br>
lude.q (which by default includes the standard Q library)
are loaded. The automatic inclusion of the prelude script
can also be suppressed with the --no-prelude compiler
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The script name can also be a
single hyphen &lsquo;-&rsquo; to indicate that the script
should be read from standard input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Script and bytecode files are
searched for on the &lsquo;&lsquo;Q library
path&rsquo;&rsquo; which usually defaults to something
like</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">.:/usr/share/q/lib:/usr/lib/q</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can override this default by
setting the QPATH environment variable, by using the -p
command line option, and with the path command of the
interpreter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Compiler and interpreter support both short and long (GNU
style) options. A brief descriptive message showing the
version number can be obtained with the --version or -V
option. <br>
You can also invoke compiler and interpreter with the --help
or -h option to print a summary of the command line syntax
and the available options. Other important options are <br>
listed below (see the Q info file for more).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-- Stops option processing
(remaining parameters will be treated as ordinary command
arguments even if they start with &lsquo;-&rsquo;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c command <br>
Execute the given interpreter command (batch mode).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Invoke the symbolic debugger
built into the interpreter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i Run interactively (print
sign-on and prompt) even when input or output is redirected.
Also cause any -c and -s options to be ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o output-file <br>
Specify the name of the bytecode file created by the
compiler (default is q.out).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Quiet startup (suppress the
sign-on message).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s command-file <br>
Source file with interpreter commands (batch mode).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w Prints warnings about
possibly undefined function symbols. This gives you a
moderate level of confidence for small or medium-sized
programs. -w2 or --pedantic prints even <br>
more diagnostics, and might be useful for larger projects.
-w3 or --paranoid prints an excessive amount of diagnostics
even for perfectly legal scripts. This is not <br>
intended to be used regularly, but may occasionally be
useful to check your script for missing declarations or
mistyped identifiers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USAGE <br>
Unless one of the -c and -s options is specified, or if
invoked with the -i option, the interpreter starts up in
interactive mode, in which the user is repeatedly prompted
to <br>
enter an expression to be evaluated, and the interpreter
answers with the corresponding &lsquo;&lsquo;normal
form.&rsquo;&rsquo; If the interpreter runs in interactive
mode and is connected to a tty, <br>
the interpreter supports command line editing and history
using the GNU readline library. The quit function causes the
interpreter to be exited. End-of-file and Ctl-C are also
<br>
handled (more or less) gracefully.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On the interactive command line,
the value of the last expression can be referred to using
the &lsquo;&lsquo;anonymous&rsquo;&rsquo; variable, denoted
by an underscore (&lsquo;_&rsquo;). Moreover, the
interpreter <br>
understands a number of special commands which allow you to
define variables, inspect and adjust various system
parameters, edit and run scripts and command source files,
read <br>
online info, load and save variables values, etc. Please
refer to the Q info page for a description of these. You can
also put such commands into the .qinitrc and .qexitrc files
<br>
in your home directory which are sourced when the
interpreter starts up and is exited in interactive mode,
respectively. This provides a convenient means, e.g., to
customize <br>
parameters of the interpreter according to your taste, and
to automatically reload and save variable values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On UNIX systems, you can also
run Q scripts directly from the shell using the
&lsquo;&lsquo;shebang&rsquo;&rsquo; #! to specify the q
program as a command language processor. For instance, use
the fol&acirc; <br>
lowing as the first line of your script to invoke q with the
option -cfoo which causes the function foo to be evaluated
at startup:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#!/usr/local/bin/q -cfoo</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Such lines will be treated as
comments by the compiler and interpreter. It is also
possible to specify compiler and interpreter options at the
beginning of the main script using <br>
the notation &lsquo;#! option&rsquo;. For instance:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#!/usr/local/bin/q <br>
#! -w <br>
#! -cfoo</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Instead of directly running the
script file, you can also use the qcwrap program to
translate the script to a C file. This is useful if your
shell does not support the #! nota&acirc; <br>
tion, or if the script is to be distributed in a
self-contained, binary form. The qcwrap program is available
as an optional addon, see the Q info file for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEBUGGING <br>
The --debug or -d option causes activation of a symbolic
debugger built into the interpreter. The debugger can also
be invoked interactively and you can set breakpoints using
<br>
the debug and break commands on the command line. The
debugger allows you to trace the reductions performed by the
Q interpreter in the course of an expression evaluation. You
<br>
can also step over reductions, abort the evaluation, and
print a list of activated rules. Use the command ? or help
in the debugger to print a list of debugger commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
QPATH A colon-separated list of directories to be searched
for source and code files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">QWARN The default warning level
(overridden with the -wn option; zero if not set).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EDITOR Editor used by the
built-in edit command of the interpreter (default: vi).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INFO_PROGRAM <br>
Program used to read online documentation with the built-in
help command of the interpreter (default: info).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GNUCLIENT_PROGRAM <br>
Program used to communicate with emacs(1) when running as a
client of gnuserv(1), which is triggered with the
interpreter&rsquo;s --gnuclient option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
q.out Default code file name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">.q_vars <br>
Default file name for loading and saving variable
definitions (load and save commands).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~/.q_history <br>
File used to store the command history when the interpreter
is run interactively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~/.qinitrc <br>
Initialization file containing interpreter commands to be
executed at startup when running interactively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~/.qexitrc <br>
Termination file containing interpreter commands to be
executed when the interpreter exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ABOUT Q <br>
Q may have started out as an academic research project, but
it should not be mistaken for a toy language. Q has a modern
syntax featuring both user-definable infix operators and
<br>
curried function applications, and provides many goodies of
modern-style functional languages, such as higher-order
functions (including lambdas), support for both eager and
lazy <br>
evaluation, and OOP-style polymorphic algebraic types. The Q
interpreter goes to great lengths to implement term
rewriting in an efficient manner, so that Q programs are
executed <br>
reasonably fast, more or less comparable to other
interpreted languages. Moreover, Q comes with an extensive
software library, which makes it a practical programming
tool and in <br>
many areas surpasses what is available for its bigger
cousins like ML and Haskell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Q interpreter is extensible
using &lsquo;&lsquo;external&rsquo;&rsquo; modules written
in C or C++ (which are loaded at runtime, if possible), and
can itself be used as an extension language for <br>
other C/C++ applications. Q has a fairly complete POSIX
system interface and a comprehensive collection of addon
modules which interface to various popular open source
software <br>
packages including, e.g., GNU Octave, various GUI, graphics,
multimedia, database and web-related libraries, and a module
for the Apache web server. There is a language mode for <br>
emacs, which provides a convenient environment for editing
and running Q scripts, and syntax files for the vim and kate
text editors are also available. All this is described in
<br>
much more detail in the Q info file and in the other
documentation available on the Q website.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CAVEATS AND BUGS <br>
The only major issue I am aware of is memory requirements.
The actual data of an expression node is only 12 bytes, but
memory management, type tags and other book-keeping
infor&acirc; <br>
mation sum up to another 12 bytes. There is no easy way
around this in the current implementation, so don&rsquo;t
expect this to change anytime soon. Fortunately, main memory
gets <br>
cheaper and bigger all the time, so this should rarely be a
problem in practice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Q interpreter uses a special
pattern-matching technique to determine matching equations
quickly and during a single left-to-right scan of each
potential redex. This usually <br>
works very well, but there are some pathological
configurations of left-hand sides of equations which cause
an exponential blow-up of the tables of the pattern-matching
automa&acirc; <br>
ton; fortunately, they are rare. You can tell that you have
run into such a situation when the interpreter needs a long
time to start up or appears to hang during bytecode
compi&acirc; <br>
lation. The only way around this currently is to rewrite
your script so that the amount of overlap between equations
is reduced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another limitation of the
current implementation is that special argument patterns and
paths to left-hand side variables are currently encoded as
bit vectors to save memory <br>
space. Thus functions cannot be declared with more than 32
special parameters, and the left-hand side of a rule or
local variable definition may not be more than 32 levels
deep. <br>
There are also some hardcoded limits in the compiler for the
sizes of the expression and code table for a single rule.
The default table sizes are fairly large and, so far, this
<br>
has never been a problem in practice. If you do run into an
&lsquo;&lsquo;expression too complex&rsquo;&rsquo; or
&lsquo;&lsquo;code table overflow&rsquo;&rsquo; error then
it is probably time to restructure your program any&acirc;
<br>
way. ;-)</p>
