<p>GIT-DEBIMPORT(1) General Commands Manual
GIT-DEBIMPORT(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
git-debimport - create a git repository from a set of
existing Debian packages</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
git-debimport [options] path-prefix</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This program will create a git repository of all files that
match ${path-prefix}_*.diff.gz or
${path-prefix}_*.debian.tar.{gz,bz2,xz} (with their
corresponding <br>
orig.tar.{gz,bz2,xz}), or of all files that match
${path-prefix}_*.tar.{gz,bz2,xz} (for Debian native
packages).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The following options are available:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--fetch <br>
Attempt to download all available versions from
snapshot.debian.org rather than use an existing set of
packages. The debsnap(1) utility, from devscripts 2.10.63 or
later, <br>
must be available in the path to use this option (earlier
debsnap versions only supported snapshot.debian.net which is
no longer a functional mirror). The packages will <br>
be downloaded into the location implied by the path-prefix
where they would normally be expected to exist already
without this option. Downloaded packages will not
auto&acirc; <br>
matically be removed after this operation is complete.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--late-merge <br>
Early versions of git-debimport would only merge the
upstream and debian branches after the import of all
packages was complete. This avoids an import failing where
the <br>
merge might have conflicts that would need to be manually
resolved. We know the import of the next package in the
series will contain a resolution to any such conflict, <br>
so delaying the merge allows the import to proceed without
intervention or introducing changes that were not part of
the original history. It does however produce a <br>
lesser quality history for the purposes of browsing the
Debian changes. All the original packages may be retrieved
from such a repo with perfect fidelity, but the diff <br>
between adjacent Debian versions will be mingled with
upstream changes too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default for current versions
of git-debimport is to merge each new upstream release as it
is imported. This gives a much more natural and useful
looking history, but <br>
may fail in some cases. Use this option to employ the older
more reliable method for packages that generate conflicts
during import.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
Be more noisy about reporting operations in progress. Mostly
only useful with the --fetch option at present.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLE <br>
Import an archive of existing &rsquo;mypackagename&rsquo;
packages from mysrcdir: <br>
$ mkdir mydestdir &amp;&amp; cd mydestdir <br>
$ git-debimport ../mysrcdir/mypackagename</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Import all available versions of
gitpkg from snapshot.debian.org: <br>
$ mkdir mydestdir &amp;&amp; cd mydestdir <br>
$ git-debimport --fetch ../my-gitpkg-sources/gitpkg</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
It is unfortunate that at the present time, many of the
tools for importing source to git from an existing revision
control system all leave something to be desired. This
script <br>
does not solve that problem. What it does do however is
create a repository that makes it possible to accurately
extract all of the earlier packages which were injected to
it. <br>
This is sadly more than can be said for the result of
running git-cvsimport on a repo created by cvs-buildpackage,
for example.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is currently very simple, and
makes a number of hard-coded assumptions about the resulting
repo. For debian-versioned packages it will create a repo
with two branches:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">upstream - for the pristine
upstream source <br>
master - for the Debianised source</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Native versioned packages will
have only the master branch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">While the loss of fine grained
history on individual commits is most regrettable, this
script enables a maintainer to import a usable record of the
previously released packages <br>
as a base for future development. This may be an acceptable
trade-off for people who feel the advantage of moving future
development to git now outweighs the inconvenience of <br>
needing to refer to a legacy repository for full details of
previous commits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hopefully the problems of
accurately importing from other revision control systems
will be solved one day, but in the meantime, a brief but
accurate history seems more useful <br>
than a detailed but largely bogus one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With the addition of the
debsnap(1) tool, the useful life of this has been extended
beyond the originally envisaged need. People who do not have
access to the original revision <br>
control history at all can build for themselves a useful
base for further development, quickly and easily, from the
packages that are still available on public snapshot
mirrors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
git-debimport does not currently handle packages with mixed
&rsquo;native&rsquo; and debian-versioned releases. This may
be added in a later version if people have real examples of
such <br>
packages they wish to import with it and we figure out a
sensible convention for how they should be stored in the
resulting repository.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Nothing particularly intelligent
is done with format 3.0 (quilt) patches currently. The
debian/patches, if any, are simply imported verbatim as
found in the source package. <br>
Ideally they should be committed to some git branch and
generated on demand at export time, rather than perpetuating
the patch-in-patch nightmare. Any packages so imported will
<br>
be recreated accurately on export, but this isn&rsquo;t
really the best form to actually work with them in git in
most cases.</p>
