This program will create a git repository of all files that match
  ${path-prefix}_*.diff.gz or ${path-prefix}_*.debian.tar.{gz,bz2,xz} (with
  their corresponding orig.tar.{gz,bz2,xz}), or of all files that match
  ${path-prefix}_*.tar.{gz,bz2,xz} (for Debian native packages).

  <dd class="It-tag">Attempt to download all available versions from
      snapshot.debian.org rather than use an existing set of packages. The
      <b>debsnap</b>(1) utility, from devscripts 2.10.63 or later, must be
      available in the path to use this option (earlier <b>debsnap</b> versions
      only supported snapshot.debian.net which is no longer a functional
      mirror). The packages will be downloaded into the location implied by the
      <i>path-prefix</i> where they would normally be expected to exist already
      without this option. Downloaded packages will not automatically be removed
      after this operation is complete.

  </dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>--late-merge</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Early versions of <b>git-debimport</b> would only merge the
      upstream and debian branches after the import of all packages was
      complete. This avoids an import failing where the merge might have
      conflicts that would need to be manually resolved. We know the import of
      the next package in the series will contain a resolution to any such
      conflict, so delaying the merge allows the import to proceed without
      intervention or introducing changes that were not part of the original
      history. It does however produce a lesser quality history for the purposes
      of browsing the Debian changes. All the original packages may be retrieved
      from such a repo with perfect fidelity, but the diff between adjacent
      Debian versions will be mingled with upstream changes too.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The default for current versions of <b>git-debimport</b> is to merge each
      new upstream release as it is imported. This gives a much more natural and
      useful looking history, but may fail in some cases. Use this option to
      employ the older more reliable method for packages that generate conflicts
      during import.

It is unfortunate that at the present time, many of the tools for importing
  source to git from an existing revision control system all leave something to
  be desired. This script does not solve that problem. What it does do however
  is create a repository that makes it possible to accurately extract all of the
  earlier packages which were injected to it. This is sadly more than can be
  said for the result of running git-cvsimport on a repo created by
  cvs-buildpackage, for example.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
It is currently very simple, and makes a number of hard-coded assumptions about
  the resulting repo. For debian-versioned packages it will create a repo with
  two branches:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>upstream</b> - for the pristine upstream source
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>master</b> - for the Debianised source
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Native versioned packages will have only the master branch.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
While the loss of fine grained history on individual commits is most
  regrettable, this script enables a maintainer to import a usable record of the
  previously released packages as a base for future development. This may be an
  acceptable trade-off for people who feel the advantage of moving future
  development to git now outweighs the inconvenience of needing to refer to a
  legacy repository for full details of previous commits.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Hopefully the problems of accurately importing from other revision control
  systems will be solved one day, but in the meantime, a brief but accurate
  history seems more useful than a detailed but largely bogus one.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
With the addition of the <b>debsnap</b>(1) tool, the useful life of this has
  been extended beyond the originally envisaged need. People who do not have
  access to the original revision control history at all can build for
  themselves a useful base for further development, quickly and easily, from the
  packages that are still available on public snapshot mirrors.

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="BUGS"><a class="selflink" href="#BUGS">BUGS</a></h1>
<b>git-debimport</b> does not currently handle packages with mixed 'native' and
  debian-versioned releases. This may be added in a later version if people have
  real examples of such packages they wish to import with it and we figure out a
  sensible convention for how they should be stored in the resulting repository.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Nothing particularly intelligent is done with format 3.0 (quilt) patches
  currently. The debian/patches, if any, are simply imported verbatim as found
  in the source package. Ideally they should be committed to some git branch and
  generated on demand at export time, rather than perpetuating the
  patch-in-patch nightmare. Any packages so imported will be recreated
  accurately on export, but this isn't really the best form to actually work
  with them in git in most cases.
