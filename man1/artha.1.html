<p>Artha(1) Artha - The Open Thesaurus Artha(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
Artha - An cross-platform thesaurus based on WordNet</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Artha is an open thesaurus based on the WordNet database,
created with simplicity in mind. Once executed, Artha
monitors for a user preset global hotkey combination. When
the <br>
user selects some text in any window, and presses this
hotkey combo, Artha looks up WordNet thesaurus for the
selected text and pops-up with the results.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When executed for the first time
Artha tries to register a hotkey automatically, in the
order, Ctrl + Alt + [W or A or T or Q]. You can view/change
it via the &rsquo;Hotkey&rsquo; button in <br>
the toolbar. It can also be disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEFINITIONS <br>
Definitions are categorized based on the PoS (Part of Speech
- Noun, Verb, Adjective and Adverb). Apart from showing the
definitions/senses of a searched string with usage
exam&acirc; <br>
ples, Artha also shows a word&rsquo;s relatives like
Synonyms, Antonyms, Derivatives, Pertainyms (Related
noun/verb), Attributes, Similar Terms, Domain/Domain Terms,
Causes, Entails, <br>
Hypernyms (is a kind of), Hyponyms (Kinds), Holonyms (is a
part of), Meronyms (Parts).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SENSES AND RELATIVES <br>
A word can have more then one sense i.e. it can convey more
than a single meaning/definition. Relative words are words
that are related to one or more senses of the searched <br>
word, by a relationship like Synonym, Derivative, etc. To
know which all sense a relative is related to, just select
the it, the corresponding senses it maps to are highlighted.
<br>
As per WordNet, depending on the number of senses a word has
(polysemy count), it&rsquo;s familiarity is determined. It
gets displayed next to the PoS in the definition area. There
are <br>
7 types: extremely rare, very rare, rare, uncommon, common,
familiar, very familiar and extremely familiar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MODES <br>
Artha has 2 modes. Simple and Detailed. Artha enters
Detailed mode when the &rsquo;Detailed&rsquo; button in the
toolbar is pressed. When toggled again, it returns back to
simple mode. For <br>
relatives like Antonyms, Pertainyms, Hypernyms, Hyponyms,
Holonyms and Meronyms, where more than one level of
relatives may be present, is showed in a tree fashion, in
detailed <br>
mode. If in simple mode, only one level of relatives are
shown even when more levels are present. E.g.
&rsquo;rich&rsquo; has &rsquo;poor&rsquo; and
&rsquo;lean&rsquo; alone as antonyms in simple mode. While
in <br>
detailed mode, &rsquo;poor&rsquo; further infers broke,
skint, etc. which are shown as children of
&rsquo;poor&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REGULAR EXPRESSIONS BASED SEARCH
<br>
Regular expressions can be used to search for a term when
you vaguely know it and want to locate it in the thesaurus.
Artha&rsquo;s regular expression pattern closely follows
Wildmat <br>
syntax by Rich Salz owing to its simplicity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* (wildcard) matches any number
of (including 0) unknown characters</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">? (joker) matches one unknown
character</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[...] (range) matches one
unknown character within the range specified</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">{m, n} (limits) upper &amp;
lower limits of the number of characters in a range</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[^...] (not in the range)
matches one unknown character NOT within the range
specified</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Expr. &lsquo;cro*p&lsquo; means
the term you want to corner starts with &lsquo;cro&lsquo;
and ends with &lsquo;p&lsquo; while the number of characters
in between are unknown. It fetches crop, crop up, croup,
<br>
crock up and crow step.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Expr. &lsquo;*chester&lsquo;
means the searched word ends with a &lsquo;chester&lsquo;
while the beginning and its number characters are unknown.
It fetches chester, manchester, rochester, win&acirc; <br>
chester and toy manchester.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Expr. &lsquo;can????r&lsquo;
means the term sought starts with &lsquo;can&lsquo; and ends
with &lsquo;r&lsquo; while you are sure that there are 5
unknown characters in between. It fetches canister and
can&acirc; <br>
nular.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Expr.
&lsquo;andre*[x|y|z]&lsquo; means the word searched for
starts with andre and ends with either an x or y or z, and
there could be any number of terms in betweem these. It <br>
fetches andre malraux, andrei tarkovsky, andres martinez,
etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Expr. &lsquo;a[c|d|e]{2,}&lsquo;
means the word looked for starts with a and then there are
minimum 2 or more occurances of c, d or e. It fetches acc,
accede, ace, add, ade and aec.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Look-ups made in Artha are stored permanently as a per-user
setting, and can be saved via the popup menu of the search
bar or can be cleared too. Other options like showing term
<br>
familiarity based on polysemy count, display of status icon,
etc. can be changed via the Options window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTIFICATIONS <br>
Should the user prefer passive desktop notifications
(balloon tips), rather than the application popping up with
the definitions, it can be done by enabling Notifications.
This <br>
is done via the Notify tool button or by right-clicking on
Artha&rsquo;s system tray icon, and tick off the
&rsquo;Notifications&rsquo; check box in the menu. When
notifications are enabled, and <br>
the user selects text in a window and presses the hotkey
combo, Artha takes the prime definition of that term from
WordNet and shows that definition as a system tray
notifica&acirc; <br>
tion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: For the notifications
feature to be present, notify library&rsquo;s binary
(libnotify.so.1) should be available on your system. If not,
Artha will not expose the feature at all. <br>
Also the notification-daemon should installed for the
notifications to show up.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SUGGESTIONS <br>
Suggestions is a feature that gives out possible near
matches when a misspelled word is searched for. To have this
feature, your system should have libenchant binary
(liben&acirc; <br>
chant.so.1) installed and an English dict file for the spell
engine to refer (locale doesn&rsquo;t matter).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AVAILABILITY <br>
Artha has a World Wide Web site at
http://artha.sourceforge.net. From this web site users can
know more about the Artha project and also download its
source and binary distribu&acirc; <br>
tions for various distros.</p>
