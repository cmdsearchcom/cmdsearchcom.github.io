Artha - An cross-platform thesaurus based on WordNet
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>Artha</b> is an open thesaurus based on the WordNet database, created with
  simplicity in mind. Once executed, Artha monitors for a user preset global
  hotkey combination. When the user selects some text in any window, and presses
  this hotkey combo, Artha looks up WordNet thesaurus for the selected text and
  pops-up with the results.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When executed for the first time Artha tries to register a hotkey automatically,
  in the order, Ctrl + Alt + [W or A or T or Q]. You can view/change it via the
  'Hotkey' button in the toolbar. It can also be disabled.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DEFINITIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#DEFINITIONS">DEFINITIONS</a></h1>
Definitions are categorized based on the PoS (Part of Speech - Noun, Verb,
  Adjective and Adverb). Apart from showing the definitions/senses of a searched
  string with usage examples, Artha also shows a word's relatives like Synonyms,
  Antonyms, Derivatives, Pertainyms (Related noun/verb), Attributes, Similar
  Terms, Domain/Domain Terms, Causes, Entails, Hypernyms (is a kind of),
  Hyponyms (Kinds), Holonyms (is a part of), Meronyms (Parts).
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="SENSES_AND_RELATIVES"><a class="selflink" href="#SENSES_AND_RELATIVES">SENSES
  AND RELATIVES</a></h2>
A word can have more then one sense i.e. it can convey more than a single
  meaning/definition. Relative words are words that are related to one or more
  senses of the searched word, by a relationship like Synonym, Derivative, etc.
  To know which all sense a relative is related to, just select the it, the
  corresponding senses it maps to are highlighted. As per WordNet, depending on
  the number of senses a word has (polysemy count), it's familiarity is
  determined. It gets displayed next to the PoS in the definition area. There
  are 7 types: extremely rare, very rare, rare, uncommon, common, familiar, very
  familiar and extremely familiar.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="MODES"><a class="selflink" href="#MODES">MODES</a></h1>
Artha has 2 modes. Simple and Detailed. Artha enters Detailed mode when the
  'Detailed' button in the toolbar is pressed. When toggled again, it returns
  back to simple mode. For relatives like Antonyms, Pertainyms, Hypernyms,
  Hyponyms, Holonyms and Meronyms, where more than one level of relatives may be
  present, is showed in a tree fashion, in detailed mode. If in simple mode,
  only one level of relatives are shown even when more levels are present. E.g.
  'rich' has 'poor' and 'lean' alone as antonyms in simple mode. While in
  detailed mode, 'poor' further infers broke, skint, etc. which are shown as
  children of 'poor'.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="REGULAR_EXPRESSIONS_BASED_SEARCH"><a class="selflink" href="#REGULAR_EXPRESSIONS_BASED_SEARCH">REGULAR
  EXPRESSIONS BASED SEARCH</a></h1>
Regular expressions can be used to search for a term when you vaguely know it
  and want to locate it in the thesaurus. Artha's regular expression pattern
  closely follows Wildmat syntax by Rich Salz owing to its simplicity.

Look-ups made in Artha are stored permanently as a per-user setting, and can be
  saved via the popup menu of the search bar or can be cleared too. Other
  options like showing term familiarity based on polysemy count, display of
  status icon, etc. can be changed via the Options window.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="NOTIFICATIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#NOTIFICATIONS">NOTIFICATIONS</a></h1>
Should the user prefer passive desktop notifications (balloon tips), rather than
  the application popping up with the definitions, it can be done by enabling
  Notifications. This is done via the Notify tool button or by right-clicking on
  Artha's system tray icon, and tick off the 'Notifications' check box in the
  menu. When notifications are enabled, and the user selects text in a window
  and presses the hotkey combo, Artha takes the prime definition of that term
  from WordNet and shows that definition as a system tray notification.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note: For the notifications feature to be present, notify library's binary
  (libnotify.so.1) should be available on your system. If not, Artha will not
  expose the feature at all. Also the notification-daemon should installed for
  the notifications to show up.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SUGGESTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#SUGGESTIONS">SUGGESTIONS</a></h1>
Suggestions is a feature that gives out possible near matches when a misspelled
  word is searched for. To have this feature, your system should have libenchant
  binary (libenchant.so.1) installed and an English dict file for the spell
  engine to refer (locale doesn't matter).

Artha has a World Wide Web site at <b>http://artha.sourceforge.net</b>. From
  this web site users can know more about the Artha project and also download
  its source and binary distributions for various distros.
