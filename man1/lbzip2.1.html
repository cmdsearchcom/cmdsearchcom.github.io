<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
lbzip2 - parallel bzip2 utility</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
lbzip2|bzip2 [-n WTHRS] [-k|-c|-t] [-d] [-1 .. -9] [-f] [-s]
[-u] [-v] [-S] [ FILE ... ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lbunzip2|bunzip2 [-n WTHRS]

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lbzip2|bzip2|lbunzip2|bunzip2|lbzcat|bzcat
-h</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Compress or decompress FILE operands or standard input to
regular files or standard output using the Burrows-Wheeler
block-sorting text compression algorithm. The lbzip2 utility
<br>
employs multiple threads and an input-bound splitter even
when decompressing .bz2 files created by standard bzip2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Compression is generally
considerably better than that achieved by more conventional
LZ77/LZ78-based compressors, and competitive with all but
the best of the PPM family of sta&acirc; <br>
tistical compressors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Compression is always performed,
even if the compressed file is slightly larger than the
original. The worst case expansion is for files of zero
length, which expand to fourteen <br>
bytes. Random data (including the output of most file
compressors) is coded with asymptotic expansion of around
0.5%.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The command-line options are
deliberately very similar to those of bzip2 and gzip, but
they are not identical.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INVOCATION <br>
The default mode of operation is compression. If the utility
is invoked as lbunzip2 or bunzip2, the mode is switched to
decompression. Calling the utility as lbzcat or bzcat <br>
selects decompression, with the decompressed byte-stream
written to standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-n WTHRS <br>
Set the number of (de)compressor threads to WTHRS. If this
option is not specified, lbzip2 tries to query the system
for the number of online processors (if both the com&acirc;
<br>
pilation environment and the execution environment support
that), or exits with an error (if it&rsquo;s unable to
determine the number of processors online).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k, --keep <br>
Don&rsquo;t remove FILE operands after successful
(de)compression. Open regular input files with more than one
link.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --stdout <br>
Write output to standard output, even when FILE operands are
present. Implies -k and excludes -t.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t, --test <br>
Test decompression; discard output instead of writing it to
files or standard output. Implies -k and excludes -c.
Roughly equivalent to passing -c and redirecting stan&acirc;
<br>
dard output to the bit bucket.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --decompress <br>
Force decompression over the mode of operation selected by
the invocation name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z, --compress <br>
Force compression over the mode of operation selected by the
invocation name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-1 .. -9 <br>
Set the compression block size to 100K .. 900K, in 100K
increments. Ignored during decompression. See also the BLOCK
SIZE section below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--fast Alias for -1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--best Alias for -9. This is the
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, --force <br>
Open non-regular input files. Open input files with more
than one link, breaking links when -k isn&rsquo;t specified
in addition. Try to remove each output file before opening
<br>
it. By default lbzip2 will not overwrite existing files; if
you want this to happen, you should specify -f. If -c and -d
are also given don&rsquo;t reject files not in bzip2 <br>
format, just copy them without change; without -f lbzip2
would stop after reaching a file that is not in bzip2
format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --small <br>
Reduce memory usage at cost of performance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u, --sequential <br>
Perform splitting input blocks sequentially. This may
improve compression ratio and decrease CPU usage, but will
degrade scalability.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
Be more verbose. Print more detailed information about
(de)compression progress to standard error: before
processing each file, print a message stating the names of
input <br>
and output files; during (de)compression, print a rough
percentage of completeness and estimated time of arrival
(only if standard error is connected to a terminal); after
<br>
processing each file print a message showing compression
ratio, space savings, total compression time (wall time) and
average (de)compression speed (bytes of plain data <br>
processed per second).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S Print condition variable
statistics to standard error for each completed
(de)compression operation. Useful in profiling.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q, --quiet, --repetitive-fast,
--repetitive-best, --exponential <br>
Accepted for compatibility with bzip2, otherwise
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Print help on command-line usage on standard output and exit
successfully.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L, --license, -V, --version
<br>
Print license and version information on standard output and
exit successfully.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
LBZIP2, BZIP2, BZIP <br>
Before parsing the command line, lbzip2 inserts the contents
of these variables, in the order specified, between the
invocation name and the rest of the command line. <br>
Tokens are separated by spaces and tabs, which cannot be
escaped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERANDS <br>
FILE Specify files to compress or decompress.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILEs with .bz2, .tbz, .tbz2 and
.tz2 name suffixes will be skipped when compressing. When
decompressing, .bz2 suffixes will be removed in output
filenames; .tbz, .tbz2 <br>
and .tz2 suffixes will be replaced by .tar; other filenames
will be suffixed with .out. If an INT or TERM signal is
delivered to lbzip2, then it removes the regular output <br>
file currently open before exiting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no FILE is given, lbzip2
works as a filter, processing standard input to standard
output. In this case, lbzip2 will decline to write
compressed output to a terminal (or <br>
read compressed input from a terminal), as this would be
entirely incomprehensible and therefore pointless.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
0 if lbzip2 finishes successfully. This presumes that
whenever it tries, lbzip2 never fails to write to standard
error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 if lbzip2 encounters a fatal
error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4 if lbzip2 issues warnings
without encountering a fatal error. This presumes that
whenever it tries, lbzip2 never fails to write to standard
error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGPIPE, SIGXFSZ <br>
if lbzip2 intends to exit with status 1 due to any fatal
error, but any such signal with inherited SIG_DFL action was
generated for lbzip2 previously, then lbzip2 termi&acirc;
<br>
nates by way of one of said signals, after cleaning up any
interrupted output file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGABRT <br>
if a runtime assertion fails (i.e. lbzip2 detects a bug in
itself). Hopefully whoever compiled your binary wasn&rsquo;t
bold enough to #define NDEBUG.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGINT, SIGTERM <br>
lbzip2 catches these signals so that it can remove an
interrupted output file. In such cases, lbzip2 exits by
re-raising (one of) the received signal(s).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BLOCK SIZE <br>
lbzip2 compresses large files in blocks. It can operate at
various block sizes, ranging from 100k to 900k in 100k
steps, and it allocates only as much memory as it needs to.
The <br>
block size affects both the compression ratio achieved, and
the amount of memory needed both for compression and
decompression. Compression and decompression speed is
virtually <br>
unaffected by block size, provided that the file being
processed is large enough to be split among all worker
threads.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The flags -1 through -9 specify
the block size to be 100,000 bytes through 900,000 bytes
(the default) respectively. At decompression-time, the block
size used for compression is <br>
read from the compressed file -- the flags -1 to -9 are
irrelevant to and so ignored during decompression.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Larger block sizes give rapidly
diminishing marginal returns; most of the compression comes
from the first two or three hundred k of block size, a fact
worth bearing in mind when <br>
using lbzip2 on small machines. It is also important to
appreciate that the decompression memory requirement is set
at compression-time by the choice of block size. In general
<br>
you should try and use the largest block size memory
constraints allow.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another significant point
applies to small files. By design, only one of
lbzip2&rsquo;s worker threads can work on a single block.
This means that if the number of blocks in the com&acirc;
<br>
pressed file is less than the number of processors online,
then some of worker threads will remain idle for the entire
time. Compressing small files with smaller block sizes can
<br>
therefore significantly increase both compression and
decompression speed. The speed difference is more noticeable
as the number of CPU cores grows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ERROR HANDLING <br>
Dealing with error conditions is the least satisfactory
aspect of lbzip2. The policy is to try and leave the
filesystem in a consistent state, then quit, even if it
means not <br>
processing some of the files mentioned in the command
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;A consistent state&rsquo;
means that a file exists either in its compressed or
uncompressed form, but not both. This boils down to the rule
&lsquo;delete the output file if an error condi&acirc; <br>
tion occurs, leaving the input intact&rsquo;. Input files
are only deleted when we can be pretty sure the output file
has been written and closed successfully.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RESOURCE ALLOCATION <br>
lbzip2 needs various kinds of system resources to operate.
Those include memory, threads, mutexes and condition
variables. The policy is to simply give up if a resource
alloca&acirc; <br>
tion failure occurs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Resource consumption grows
linearly with number of worker threads. If lbzip2 fails
because of lack of some resources, decreasing number of
worker threads may help. It would be <br>
possible for lbzip2 to try to reduce number of worker
threads (and hence the resource consumption), or to move on
to subsequent files in the hope that some might need less
<br>
resources, but the complications for doing this seem more
trouble than they are worth.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DAMAGED FILES <br>
lbzip2 attempts to compress data by performing several
non-trivial transformations on it. Every compression of a
file implies an assumption that the compressed file can be
decom&acirc; <br>
pressed to reproduce the original. Great efforts in design,
coding and testing have been made to ensure that this
program works correctly. However, the complexity of the
algo&acirc; <br>
rithms, and, in particular, the presence of various special
cases in the code which occur with very low but non-zero
probability make it very difficult to rule out the
possibil&acirc; <br>
ity of bugs remaining in the program. That is not to say
this program is inherently unreliable. Indeed, I very much
hope the opposite is true -- lbzip2 has been carefully
con&acirc; <br>
structed and extensively tested.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As a self-check for your
protection, lbzip2 uses 32-bit CRCs to make sure that the
decompressed version of a file is identical to the original.
This guards against corruption of <br>
the compressed data, and against undiscovered bugs in lbzip2
(hopefully unlikely). The chances of data corruption going
undetected is microscopic, about one chance in four
bil&acirc; <br>
lion for each file processed. Be aware, though, that the
check occurs upon decompression, so it can only tell you
that that something is wrong.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CRCs can only detect corrupted
files, they can&rsquo;t help you recover the original,
uncompressed data. However, because of the block nature of
the compression algorithm, it may be <br>
possible to recover some parts of the damaged file, even if
some blocks are destroyed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Separate input files don&rsquo;t share worker threads; at
most one input file is worked on at any moment.</p>
