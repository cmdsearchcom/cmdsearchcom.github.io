<p>XAUTH(1) General Commands Manual XAUTH(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
nxauth - NoMachine X authority file utility</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
nxauth [ -f authfile ] [ -vqib ] [ command arg ... ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The nxauth program is used to edit and display the
authorization information used in connecting to the X
server. This program is usually used to extract
authorization records <br>
from one machine and merge them in on another (as is the
case when using remote logins or granting access to other
users). Commands (described below) may be entered
interac&acirc; <br>
tively, on the nxauth command line, or in scripts. Note that
this program does not contact the X server except when the
generate command is used. Normally nxauth is not used to
<br>
create the authority file entry in the first place; xdm does
that.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The following options may be used with nxauth. They may be
given individually (e.g., -q -i) or may combined (e.g.,
-qi).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f authfile <br>
This option specifies the name of the authority file to use.
By default, nxauth will use the file specified by the
nxauthORITY environment variable or .Xauthority in the <br>
user&rsquo;s home directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q This option indicates that
nxauth should operate quietly and not print unsolicited
status messages. This is the default if an nxauth command is
is given on the command <br>
line or if the standard output is not directed to a
terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v This option indicates that
nxauth should operate verbosely and print status messages
indicating the results of various operations (e.g., how many
records have been read <br>
in or written out). This is the default if nxauth is reading
commands from its standard input and its standard output is
directed to a terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i This option indicates that
nxauth should ignore any authority file locks. Normally,
nxauth will refuse to read or edit any authority files that
have been locked by other <br>
programs (usually xdm or another nxauth).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b This option indicates that
nxauth should attempt to break any authority file locks
before proceeding. Use this option only to clean up stale
locks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMANDS <br>
The following commands may be used to manipulate authority
files:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">add displayname protocolname
hexkey <br>
An authorization entry for the indicated display using the
given protocol and key data is added to the authorization
file. The data is specified as an even-lengthed <br>
string of hexadecimal digits, each pair representing one
octet. The first digit of each pair gives the most
significant 4 bits of the octet, and the second digit of the
<br>
pair gives the least significant 4 bits. For example, a 32
character hexkey would represent a 128-bit value. A protocol
name consisting of just a single period is <br>
treated as an abbreviation for MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">generate displayname
protocolname [trusted|untrusted] <br>
[timeout seconds] [group group-id] [data hexdata]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command is similar to add.
The main difference is that instead of requiring the user to
supply the key data, it connects to the server specified in
displayname and <br>
uses the SECURITY extension in order to get the key data to
store in the authorization file. If the server cannot be
contacted or if it does not support the SECURITY <br>
extension, the command fails. Otherwise, an authorization
entry for the indicated display using the given protocol is
added to the authorization file. A protocol name <br>
consisting of just a single period is treated as an
abbreviation for MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the trusted option is used,
clients that connect using this authorization will have full
run of the display, as usual. If untrusted is used, clients
that connect <br>
using this authorization will be considered untrusted and
prevented from stealing or tampering with data belonging to
trusted clients. See the SECURITY extension speci&acirc;
<br>
fication for full details on the restrictions imposed on
untrusted clients. The default is untrusted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The timeout option specifies how
long in seconds this authorization will be valid. If the
authorization remains unused (no clients are connected with
it) for longer than <br>
this time period, the server purges the authorization, and
future attempts to connect using it will fail. Note that the
purging done by the server does not delete the <br>
authorization entry from the authorization file. The default
timeout is 60 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The group option specifies the
application group that clients connecting with this
authorization should belong to. See the application group
extension specification for <br>
more details. The default is to not belong to an application
group.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The data option specifies data
that the server should use to generate the authorization.
Note that this is not the same data that gets written to the
authorization file. <br>
The interpretation of this data depends on the authorization
protocol. The hexdata is in the same format as the hexkey
described in the add command. The default is to <br>
send no data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[n]extract filename
displayname... <br>
Authorization entries for each of the specified displays are
written to the indicated file. If the nextract command is
used, the entries are written in a numeric format <br>
suitable for non-binary transmission (such as secure
electronic mail). The extracted entries can be read back in
using the merge and nmerge commands. If the filename <br>
consists of just a single dash, the entries will be written
to the standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[n]list [displayname...] <br>
Authorization entries for each of the specified displays (or
all if no displays are named) are printed on the standard
output. If the nlist command is used, entries will <br>
be shown in the numeric format used by the nextract command;
otherwise, they are shown in a textual format. Key data is
always displayed in the hexadecimal format given <br>
in the description of the add command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[n]merge [filename...] <br>
Authorization entries are read from the specified files and
are merged into the authorization database, superceding any
matching existing entries. If the nmerge command <br>
is used, the numeric format given in the description of the
extract command is used. If a filename consists of just a
single dash, the standard input will be read if it <br>
hasn&rsquo;t been read before.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">remove displayname... <br>
Authorization entries matching the specified displays are
removed from the authority file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">source filename <br>
The specified file is treated as a script containing nxauth
commands to execute. Blank lines and lines beginning with a
sharp sign (#) are ignored. A single dash may be <br>
used to indicate the standard input, if it hasn&rsquo;t
already been read.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">info Information describing the
authorization file, whether or not any changes have been
made, and from where nxauth commands are being read is
printed on the standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">exit If any modifications have
been made, the authority file is written out (if allowed),
and the program exits. An end of file is treated as an
implicit exit command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">quit The program exits, ignoring
any modifications. This may also be accomplished by pressing
the interrupt character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">help [string] <br>
A description of all commands that begin with the given
string (or all commands if no string is given) is printed on
the standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">? A short list of the valid
commands is printed on the standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DISPLAY NAMES <br>
Display names for the add, [n]extract, [n]list, [n]merge,
and remove commands use the same format as the DISPLAY
environment variable and the common -display command line
argu&acirc; <br>
ment. Display-specific information (such as the screen
number) is unnecessary and will be ignored. Same-machine
connections (such as local-host sockets, shared memory, and
the <br>
Internet Protocol hostname localhost) are referred to as
hostname/unix:displaynumber so that local entries for
different machines may be stored in one authority file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLE <br>
The most common use for nxauth is to extract the entry for
the current display, copy it to another machine, and merge
it into the user&rsquo;s authority file on the remote
machine:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% nxauth extract - $DISPLAY |
rsh otherhost nxauth merge -</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following command contacts
the server :0 to create an authorization using the
MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 protocol. Clients that connect with this
authorization will be untrusted. <br>
% nxauth generate :0 .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
This nxauth program uses the following environment
variables:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">XAUTHORITY <br>
to get the name of the authority file to use if the -f
option isn&rsquo;t used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOME to get the user&rsquo;s
home directory if XAUTHORITY isn&rsquo;t defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
$HOME/.Xauthority <br>
default authority file if XAUTHORITY isn&rsquo;t
defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Users that have unsecure networks should take care to use
encrypted file transfer mechanisms to copy authorization
entries between machines. Similarly, the MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1
<br>
protocol is not very useful in unsecure environments. Sites
that are interested in additional security may need to use
encrypted authorization mechanisms such as Kerberos.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Spaces are currently not allowed
in the protocol name. Quoting could be added for the truly
perverse.</p>
