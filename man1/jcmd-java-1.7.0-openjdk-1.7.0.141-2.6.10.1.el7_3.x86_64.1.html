<p>jcmd(1) General Commands Manual jcmd(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Name <br>
jcmd - Sends diagnostic command requests to a running Java
Virtual Machine</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
jcmd [ options ] <br>
jcmd [ pid | main-class ] PerfCounter.print <br>
jcmd [ pid | main-class ] command [arguments] <br>
jcmd [ pid | main-class ] -f file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">options <br>
The command-line options. See Options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pid <br>
Identifies the process that receives the diagnostic command
requests. The process must be a Java process. To get a list
of Java processes running on a machine, use jps(1) <br>
or jcmd(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">main-class <br>
The main class of the process that receives the diagnostic
command requests. When matching processes, any process whose
main class name contains the specified string as a <br>
substring is matched. If several running Java processes
share the same main class, then the diagnostic command
request is sent to all these processes. To get a list of
Java <br>
processes running on a machine, use jps(1) or jcmd(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">command [arguments] <br>
The main class of the process that receives the diagnostic
command requests. When matching processes, any process whose
main class name contains the specified string as a <br>
substring is matched. If several running Java processes
share the same main class, then the diagnostic command
request is sent to all these processes. To get a list of
Java <br>
processes running on a machine, use jps(1) or jcmd(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perfcounter.print <br>
Print the performance counters available on the targeted
Java processes. The list of performance counters might vary
with the Java process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f file <br>
Read commands from file and call them on the targeted Java
processes. In file, each command must be written on a single
line. Lines starting with # are ignored. Processing <br>
of file ends when all lines have been called or when a line
containing the stop keyword is read.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
jcmd is a utility to send diagnostic command requests to a
Java Virtual Machine supporting this feature.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Used without arguments or with
the -l option, jcmd prints the list of running Java
processes with their process ID, their main class and their
command-line arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a process ID is specified
on the command line, jcmd sends the diagnostic command
request to the process with this ID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a main class is specified
on the command line, jcmd sends the diagnostic command
request to all Java processes for which the command-line
argument is a substring of the Java <br>
process&rsquo; main class.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With the PerfCounter.print
argument, jcmd prints the performance counters available on
the targeted Java processes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With the -f option, jcmd sends
to the targeted Java processes the diagnostic commands
stored in the specified file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Options are mutually exclusive. Options, when used, must
immediately follow the command name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l Prints the list of running
Java processes with their process IDs, their main classes,
and their command-line arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Prints a help message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-help <br>
Prints a help message.</p>
