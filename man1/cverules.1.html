cverules - Generate version matching rules for installed software on a Linux /
  Unix distribution
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
The cverules script will scan the installed distribution packages on your system
  and attempt to generate version matching rules that can be used by cvechecker.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The script should be used by people interested in contributing to the
  cvechecker' success.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="USAGE"><a class="selflink" href="#USAGE">USAGE</a></h1>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="COMMAND_USAGE"><a class="selflink" href="#COMMAND_USAGE">COMMAND
  USAGE</a></h2>
The command requires a single option, -r. An example usage pattern is like so:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
~$ cverules -r &gt; output.txt
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The generated <i>output.txt</i> file can then be submitted to the cvechecker
  project, allowing it to improve the versions.dat.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="USABILITY"><a class="selflink" href="#USABILITY">USABILITY</a></h2>
The user should understand that this script attempts to generate matches, but
  doesn't guarantee that each and every installed software is detected.
<div class="Pp"></div>
First of all, if a package is already matched by existing rules, the rest of the
  package' content isn't scanned anymore. This is because the tool wants to
  identify software and versions - once one has been detected, further detection
  is less useful and very resource consuming.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Second, if a package isn't detected properly, the script will see if the version
  based on the distributions' package version can be found. If it can't, then it
  cannot identify the version properly and ignores the package.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Third, if the script does find a match for the version, it tries out a few
  regular expressions (which have a high probability rate to match the version)
  but has no intelligence to optimize the expressions. If the tried expressions
  fail, the script will ignore the package.
