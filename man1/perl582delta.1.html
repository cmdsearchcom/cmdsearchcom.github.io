<p>PERL582DELTA(1) Perl Programmers Reference Guide
PERL582DELTA(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
perl582delta - what is new for perl v5.8.2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This document describes differences between the 5.8.1
release and the 5.8.2 release.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are upgrading from an
earlier release such as 5.6.1, first read the perl58delta,
which describes differences between 5.6.0 and 5.8.0, and the
perl581delta, which describes <br>
differences between 5.8.0 and 5.8.1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Incompatible Changes <br>
For threaded builds for modules calling certain re-entrant
system calls, binary compatibility was accidentally lost
between 5.8.0 and 5.8.1. Binary compatibility with 5.8.0 has
<br>
been restored in 5.8.2, which necessitates breaking
compatibility with 5.8.1. We see this as the lesser of two
evils.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This will only affect people who
have a threaded perl 5.8.1, and compiled modules which use
these calls, and now attempt to run the compiled modules
with 5.8.2. The fix is to re- <br>
compile and re-install the modules using 5.8.2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Core Enhancements <br>
Hash Randomisation <br>
The hash randomisation introduced with 5.8.1 has been
amended. It transpired that although the implementation
introduced in 5.8.1 was source compatible with 5.8.0, it was
not <br>
binary compatible in certain cases. 5.8.2 contains an
improved implementation which is both source and binary
compatible with both 5.8.0 and 5.8.1, and remains robust
against the <br>
form of attack which prompted the change for 5.8.1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">We are grateful to the Debian
project for their input in this area. See &quot;Algorithmic
Complexity Attacks&quot; in perlsec for the original
rationale behind this change.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Threading <br>
Several memory leaks associated with variables shared
between threads have been fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Modules and Pragmata <br>
Updated Modules And Pragmata <br>
The following modules and pragmata have been updated since
Perl 5.8.1:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Devel::PPPort <br>
Digest::MD5 <br>
I18N::LangTags <br>
libnet <br>
MIME::Base64 <br>
Pod::Perldoc <br>
strict <br>
Documentation improved</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tie::Hash <br>
Documentation improved</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Time::HiRes <br>
Unicode::Collate <br>
Unicode::Normalize <br>
UNIVERSAL <br>
Documentation improved</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Selected Bug Fixes <br>
Some syntax errors involving unrecognized filetest operators
are now handled correctly by the parser.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Changed Internals <br>
Interpreter initialization is more complete when
-DMULTIPLICITY is off. This should resolve problems with
initializing and destroying the Perl interpreter more than
once in a <br>
single process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Platform Specific Problems <br>
Dynamic linker flags have been tweaked for Solaris and OS X,
which should solve problems seen while building some XS
modules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bugs in OS/2 sockets and tmpfile
have been fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In OS X &quot;setreuid&quot; and
friends are troublesome - perl will now work around their
problems as best possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Future Directions <br>
Starting with 5.8.3 we intend to make more frequent
maintenance releases, with a smaller number of changes in
each. The intent is to propagate bug fixes out to stable
releases <br>
more rapidly and make upgrading stable releases less of an
upheaval. This should give end users more flexibility in
their choice of upgrade timing, and allow them easier <br>
assessment of the impact of upgrades. The current plan is
for code freezes as follows</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; 5.8.3 23:59:59
GMT, Wednesday December 31st 2003</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; 5.8.4 23:59:59
GMT, Wednesday March 31st 2004</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; 5.8.5 23:59:59
GMT, Wednesday June 30th 2004</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">with the release following soon
after, when testing is complete.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See &quot;Future
Directions&quot; in perl581delta for more soothsaying.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Reporting Bugs <br>
If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the
articles recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc
newsgroup and the perl bug database at
http://bugs.perl.org/. There <br>
may also be information at http://www.perl.com/, the Perl
Home Page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you believe you have an
unreported bug, please run the perlbug program included with
your release. Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case. Your bug <br>
report, along with the output of &quot;perl -V&quot;, will
be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl
porting team. You can browse and search the Perl 5 bugs at
<br>
http://bugs.perl.org/</p>
