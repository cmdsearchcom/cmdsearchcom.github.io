<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
abxtest - double-blind ABX comparison testing script</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
abxtest [-n min] [-m max] [-g goal] A-cmd B-cmd</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
abxtest is a tool for conducting listening (or other
subjective) tests to determine whether a listener can
discern a difference between two subjects under test,
denoted A and B.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The listener conducts several
trials in which an unknown subject, X, is randomly chosen to
be either A or B. The probability that X is A or B is the
same. The listener must <br>
decide whether X sounds the same as A or the same as B. The
listener may repeat A, B, and X as many times as necessary
before reaching a verdict.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to prove the hypothesis
that a difference can be discerned between A and B, the
listener must disprove the null hypothesis that A sounds the
same as B. This is accom&acirc; <br>
plished by correctly identifying X often enough that
randomly guessing correctly the same number of times would
be statistically improbable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The A and B subjects for abxtest
are actually arbitrary shell commands. The normal mode of
use would be to give commands which play two slightly
different sounds. The standard <br>
output and standard error from each command are suppressed
so as not to reveal the identity of X. The listener may
interrupt an executing command (usually by pressing ^C)
with&acirc; <br>
out terminating the test.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-n min Set the minimum number of trials. Trials will
continue after this number if the statistical probability
goal has not yet been met. The default is 10.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m max Set the maximum number of
trials. Trials will end after this number even if the
statistical probability goal has not been met. The default
is 20.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g goal <br>
Set the minimum statistical probability goal. This is the
probability that the number of correct identifications is
the same as random guesses. In order to disprove the <br>
null hypothesis, the result of the test must be a
probability less than or equal to this goal. The default is
0.05.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/dev/random <br>
By default this file is read to generate a random sequence
of X.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
RANDOM_FILE <br>
If set, the file named by this variable will be read instead
of /dev/random to generate a sequence of X.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
abxtest uses the binomial distribution to accurately
calculate the probability that the result is the same as
random guesses.</p>
