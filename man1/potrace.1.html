<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
potrace - transform bitmaps into vector graphics.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
potrace [options] [filename...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
potrace is a tool for tracing a bitmap, which means,
transforming a bitmap into a smooth, scalable image. The
input is a bitmap, which means, a pixel-based image composed
of the <br>
two colors black and white only. The output is SVG, PDF,
EPS, or one of a number of other vector formats. A typical
use is to create vector graphics from scanned data, such as
<br>
company or university logos, handwritten notes, etc. The
resulting image is not &quot;jaggy&quot; like a bitmap, but
smooth. It can then be rendered at any resolution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">potrace can read bitmaps in the
following formats: PBM, PGM, PPM (collectively known as PNM,
see pnm(5)), as well as BMP (Windows and OS/2 bitmap
formats). The input image should <br>
only use the two colors black and white. If other pixel
values appear in the input, they will be converted to black
and white using a simple threshold method.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">potrace can currently produce
the following output formats: SVG, PDF, EPS, PostScript,
DXF, GeoJSON, PGM, Gimppath, and XFig. Additional backends
might be added in the future.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The following options are supported. Dimensions (arguments
of type dim) can have optional units, e.g. 6.5in, 15cm,
100pt. The default unit is inches (or centimeters, if this
was <br>
configured at compile time, see COMPILE TIME CONFIGURATION
below). For pixel-based output formats such as PGM, DXF,
GeoJSON, and Gimppath, the default unit is pixels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">General options: <br>
-h, --help print help message and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --version print version info
and exit. This also shows the defaults that were compiled
into this version of potrace.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, --license print license info
and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Input/output options: <br>
filename Each file can hold an input image, or multiple
concatenated input images. If filename arguments are given,
then potrace will by default create one output file for <br>
each input filename given. The name of the output file is
obtained from the input filename by changing its suffix
according to the chosen backend. If changing the <br>
suffix is impossible because the names of the input and
output files would be identical, then the output filename is
created by adding the &quot;-out&quot; suffix to the <br>
name of the input file. If no filename arguments are given,
then potrace acts as a filter, reading from standard input
and writing to standard output. A filename <br>
of &quot;-&quot; may be given to specify reading from
standard input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o filename, --output filename
<br>
write output to this file. All output is directed to the
specified file. If this option is used, then multiple input
filenames are only allowed for multi-page <br>
backends (see BACKEND TYPES below). In this case, each input
file may contain one or more bitmaps, and all the bitmaps
from all the input files are processed and <br>
the output concatenated into a single file. A filename of
&quot;-&quot; may be given to specify writing to standard
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-- End of options. Any remaining
arguments are interpreted as filenames. This also disables
filter mode, even if no filenames are given. This is useful
for shell <br>
scripts, because potrace -- $FILENAMES will behave correctly
even for an empty list of filenames. However, -- with an
empty list of filenames is not permitted in <br>
conjunction with the -o option, because this would generate
a document of zero pages, which none of the backends
permit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Backend selection: <br>
For general information, see also BACKEND TYPES below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b name, --backend name <br>
Select backend by name, where name is one of eps,
postscript, ps, pdf, pdfpage, svg, dxf, geojson, pgm,
gimppath, xfig. Backend names can be abbreviated by a
pre&acirc; <br>
fix as long as it is unambiguous. Backend names are case
insensitive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --svg, -b svg, --backend svg
<br>
SVG backend. The output is a Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)
file. This is a single-page, variable-sized, dimension-based
backend. Note that unless the -r option <br>
is given, the resolution of the input bitmap is assumed to
be 72dpi.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b pdf, --backend pdf <br>
PDF backend. The output is a file in the Portable Document
Format. If the input consists of multiple bitmaps, they are
each rendered on a separate page. This is a <br>
multi-page, variable-sized, dimension-based backend.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b pdfpage, --backend pdfpage
<br>
The PDFPage backend is like the PDF backend, except that it
is fixed-size like the PostScript backend.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e, --eps, -b eps, --backend eps
<br>
EPS backend (default). The output is an encapsulated
PostScript file. This is a single-page, variable-sized,
dimension-based backend.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, --postscript, -b ps,
--backend ps <br>
PostScript backend. The output is a PostScript file. This is
a multi-page, fixed-size, dimension-based backend. If the
input consists of multiple bitmaps, they are <br>
each rendered on a separate page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b dxf, --backend dxf <br>
DXF backend. The output is a file in the Drawing Interchange
Format (DXF). In this backend, all Bezier curves are
approximated by piecewise circular arcs; this is <br>
suitable for processing in CAD software or for machining
applications using CNC tools. This is a single-page,
variable-sized, pixel-based backend. The -u option <br>
has no effect for this backend.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b geojson, --backend geojson
<br>
GeoJSON backend. The output is a file in the format used by
some applications processing geographical data. In this
backend, all Bezier curves are approximated by <br>
8 straight line segments. This is a single-page,
variable-sized, pixel-based backend. The -u option has no
effect for this backend.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g, --pgm, -b pgm, --backend pgm
<br>
PGM backend. The output is a portable greymap (PGM) file. It
is a convenient backend for antialiasing a bitmap image.
This is a multi-page, variable-sized, pixel- <br>
based backend. If the input consists of more than one image,
the images are concatenated in the output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b gimppath, --backend gimppath
<br>
Gimppath backend. This backend produces output suitable to
be imported as a path by the GNU Image Manipulation Program
(Gimp) (in the Layers, Channels &amp; Paths dia&acirc; <br>
log, select Paths, then right-click and select Import Path).
The output is actually an SVG file. The differences to the
SVG backend are: the --opaque option has no <br>
effect, the --flat option is always on, and the dimensions
are pixel-based. This is a single-page, variable-sized,
pixel-based backend.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b xfig, --backend xfig <br>
XFig backend. This is a single-page, fixed-size,
dimension-based backend. The output is a file in the XFig
format. Note that XFig uses X-splines instead of Bezier <br>
curves, thus it is not possible to translate the output of
potrace into the XFig format with absolute accuracy. This
backend does a reasonable approximation using <br>
two control points for each Bezier curve segment. The -u
option has no effect for this backend, because control
points are always rounded to the nearest 1/1200 of <br>
an inch in XFig. Curve optimization is disabled. Implies
--opaque.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Algorithm options: <br>
For more detailed information on these options, see
TECHNICAL DOCUMENTATION below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z policy, --turnpolicy policy
<br>
specify how to resolve ambiguities in path decomposition.
Must be one of black, white, right, left, minority,
majority, or random. Default is minority. Turn poli&acirc;
<br>
cies can be abbreviated by an unambiguous prefix, e.g., one
can specify min instead of minority.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t n, --turdsize n <br>
suppress speckles of up to this many pixels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a n, --alphamax n <br>
set the corner threshold parameter. The default value is 1.
The smaller this value, the more sharp corners will be
produced. If this parameter is 0, then no <br>
smoothing will be performed and the output is a polygon. If
this parameter is greater than 4/3, then all corners are
suppressed and the output is completely <br>
smooth.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --longcurve <br>
turn off curve optimization. Normally potrace tries to join
adjacent Bezier curve segments when this is possible. This
option disables this behavior, resulting in <br>
a larger file size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O n, --opttolerance n <br>
set the curve optimization tolerance. The default value is
0.2. Larger values allow more consecutive Bezier curve
segments to be joined together in a single seg&acirc; <br>
ment, at the expense of accuracy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u n, --unit n set output
quantization. Coordinates in the output are rounded to
1/unit pixels. The default of 10 usually gives good results.
For some of the debug modes, a value <br>
of 100 gives more accurate output. This option has no effect
for the XFig backend, which always rasterizes to 1/1200
inch, or for the DXF backend. For the GeoJSON <br>
backend, this option is only a hint; the actual rounding may
be more, but not less, accurate than specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d n, --debug n <br>
produce debugging output of type n. This has different
effects for different backends. For the PostScript/EPS
backends, the values n=1,2,3 illustrate the interme&acirc;
<br>
diate stages of the potrace algorithm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Scaling and placement options:
<br>
-P format, --pagesize format <br>
for fixed-size backends, set page size. The following
formats can be specified: A4, A3, A5, B5, Letter, Legal,
Tabloid, Statement, Executive, Folio, Quarto, 10x14. <br>
Format names are case insensitive. Also, an argument of the
form dimxdim is accepted to specify arbitrary dimensions.
The default page size is Letter (or A4, if <br>
this was configured at compile time, see COMPILE TIME
CONFIGURATION below). Page format names can be abbreviated
by a prefix as long as it is unambiguous. This <br>
option has no effect for variable-sized backends.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-W dim, --width dim <br>
set the width of output image (before any rotation and
margins). If only one of width and height is specified, the
other is adjusted accordingly so that the aspect <br>
ratio is preserved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H dim, --height dim <br>
set the height of output image. See -W for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r n[xn], --resolution n[xn]
<br>
for dimension-based backends, set the resolution (in dpi).
One inch in the output image corresponds to this many pixels
in the input. Note that a larger value <br>
results in a smaller output image. It is possible to specify
separate resolutions in the x and y directions by giving an
argument of the form nxn. For variable- <br>
sized backends, the default resolution is 72dpi. For
fixed-size backends, there is no default resolution; the
image is by default scaled to fit on the page. This <br>
option has no effect for pixel-based backends. If -W or -H
are specified, they take precedence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x n[xn], --scale n[xn] <br>
for pixel-based backends, set the scaling factor. A value
greater than 1 enlarges the output, a value between 0 and 1
makes the output smaller. The default is 1. <br>
It is possible to specify separate scaling factors for the x
and y directions by giving an argument of the form nxn. This
option has no effect for dimension-based <br>
backends. If -W or -H are specified, they take
precedence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S n, --stretch n <br>
set the aspect ratio. A value greater than 1 means the image
will be stretched in the y direction. A value between 0 and
1 means the image will be compressed in <br>
the y direction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A angle, --rotate angle <br>
set the rotation angle (in degrees). The output will be
rotated counterclockwise by this angle. This is useful for
compensating for images that were scanned not <br>
quite upright.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M dim, --margin dim <br>
set all four margins. The effect and default value of this
option depend on the backend. For variable-sized backends,
the margins will simply be added around the <br>
output image (or subtracted, in case of negative margins).
The default margin for these backends is 0. For fixed-size
backends, the margin settings can be used to <br>
control the placement of the image on the page. If only one
of the left and right margin is given, the image will be
placed this distance from the respective edge <br>
of the page, and similarly for top and bottom. If margins
are given on opposite sides, the image is scaled to fit
between these margins, unless the scaling is <br>
already determined explicitly by one or more of the -W, -H,
-r, or -x options. By default, fixed-size backends use a
non-zero margin whose width depends on the <br>
page size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L dim, --leftmargin dim <br>
set the left margin. See -M for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R dim, --rightmargin dim <br>
set the right margin. See -M for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T dim, --topmargin dim <br>
set the top margin. See -M for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B dim, --bottommargin dim <br>
set the bottom margin. See -M for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--tight remove whitespace around
the image before scaling and margins are applied. If this
option is given, calculations of the width, height, and
margins are based on the <br>
actual vector outline, rather than on the outer dimensions
of the input pixmap, which is the default. In particular,
the --tight option can be used to remove any <br>
existing margins from the input image. See the file
placement.pdf for a more detailed illustration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Color options: <br>
These options are only supported by certain backends. The
DXF and GeoJSON backends do not support color.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C #rrggbb, --color #rrggbb <br>
set the foreground color of the output image. The default is
black.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--fillcolor #rrggbb <br>
set the fill color of the output image, i.e., the color of
the &quot;white&quot; parts that are enclosed by
&quot;black&quot; parts. The default is to leave these parts
transparent. <br>
Implies --opaque. Please note that this option sets the
background color; to set the foreground color, use --color
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--opaque fill in the white parts
of the image opaquely, instead of leaving them transparent.
This only applies to interior white parts, i.e., those that
are enclosed inside <br>
a black outline. Opaqueness is always in effect for the XFig
backend.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SVG options: <br>
--group for SVG output, try to group related paths together.
Each path is grouped together with all paths that are
contained inside it, so that they can be moved around as
<br>
a unit with an SVG editor. This makes coloring individual
components slightly more cumbersome, and thus it is not the
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--flat for SVG output, put the
entire image into a single path. This makes it impossible to
color the components individually, and thus it is not the
default. But the <br>
resulting SVG file can be more easily imported by some
applications such as Gimp. In fact, the Gimppath backend is
a variation of the SVG backend with the --flat <br>
option and pixel-based scaling. The --flat option has no
effect if --opaque has been selected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PostScript/EPS/PDF options: <br>
-c, --cleartext <br>
do not compress the output. This option disables the use of
compression filters in the PostScript and PDF output. In the
PostScript backend, if -c and -q are used <br>
together, the resulting output can be easily read by other
programs or even by humans.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-2, --level2 use PostScript
level 2 compression (default). The resulting file size is
ca. 40% smaller than if the -c option is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-3, --level3 use PostScript
level 3 compression, if available. This gives slightly
smaller files than using -2, but the resulting files may not
print on older PostScript level <br>
2 printers. If support for PostScript level 3 compression
has been disabled at compile time, a warning message is
printed and level 2 compression is used instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q, --longcoding <br>
turn off optimized numerical coding in PostScript output.
Normally, potrace uses a very compact numerical format to
represent Bezier curves in PostScript, taking <br>
advantage of existing redundancy in the curve parameters.
This option disables this behavior, resulting in longer, but
more readable output (particularly if the -c <br>
option is also used).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PGM options: <br>
-G n, --gamma n <br>
set the gamma value for anti-aliasing (default is 2.2). Most
computer displays do not render shades of grey linearly,
i.e., a grey value of 0.5 is not displayed as <br>
being exactly half-way between black and white. The gamma
parameter corrects for this, and therefore leads to nicer
looking output. The default value of 2.2 is <br>
appropriate for most normal CRT displays.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Frontend options: <br>
-k n, --blacklevel n <br>
set the threshold level for converting input images to
bitmaps. The potrace algorithm expects a bitmap, thus all
pixels of the input images are converted to black <br>
or white before processing begins. Pixels whose brightness
is less than n are converted to black, all other pixels to
white. Here n is a number between 0 and 1. <br>
One case is treated specially: if the input is in an indexed
color format with exactly 2 colors, then the blacklevel is
ignored and the darker of the two colors is <br>
mapped to black.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: the method used by potrace
for converting greymaps to bitmaps is very crude; much
better results can be obtained if a separate program, such
as mkbitmap(1), <br>
is used for this purpose. In particular, mkbitmap(1), which
is distributed with potrace, has the ability to scale and
interpolate the image before thresholding, <br>
which results in much better preservation of detail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i, --invert invert the input
bitmap before processing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Progress bar options: <br>
--progress display a progress bar for each bitmap that is
processed. This is useful for interactive use. The default
behavior is not to show any progress information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--tty mode set the terminal mode
for progress bar rendering. Possible values are
&quot;vt100&quot;, which requires a vt100-compatible
terminal, and &quot;dumb&quot;, which uses only ASCII
char&acirc; <br>
acters. The default is system dependent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BACKEND TYPES <br>
Backends can be classified in several ways, which affects
the available command line options and their behavior:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fixed-size or variable-sized:
<br>
For fixed-size backends, the size of the page is always the
same (for example Letter or A4, as specified at compile time
or by the -P option). By default, the image will be <br>
centered and scaled to fit the page size. For variable-size
backends, the size of the page follows the size of the
image. Currently the PostScript (PS), PDFPage, and XFig <br>
backends are fixed-size, and the remaining backends are
variable-size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Dimension-based or pixel-based:
<br>
In dimension-based backends, distances are measured in
physical units such as inches or centimeters. In pixel-based
backends, distances are measured in pixel units. The -r <br>
option only works for dimension-based backends, and the -x
option only works for pixel-based backends. Currently, the
DXF, PGM, Gimppath, and GeoJSON backends are pixel- <br>
based, and the remaining backends are dimension-based.
Currently, all pixel-based backends are variable-sized.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Single-page or multi-page: <br>
Single-page backends can only accept a single image.
Multi-page backends can accept multiple images, typically
one per page of output. Currently, the PostScript (PS), PDF,
<br>
PDFPage, and PGM backends are multi-page, and the remaining
backends are single-page. Note that multiple input images
can be read in two ways: from multiple input files <br>
(with the -o option), or from a single input file that holds
several concatenated images.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMPILE TIME CONFIGURATION <br>
Certain aspects of the behavior of potrace can be configured
at compile time by passing the following options to the
./configure script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--disable-zlib <br>
compile potrace without the zlib compression library. This
means PostScript level 3 compression will not be
available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--enable-metric <br>
compile potrace with centimeters as the default unit instead
of inches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--enable-a4 <br>
compile potrace with A4 as the default page size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The exit status is 0 on successful completion, 1 if the
command line was invalid, and 2 on any other error.</p>
