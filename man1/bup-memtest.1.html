<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
bup-memtest - test bup memory usage statistics</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
bup memtest [options...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
bup memtest opens the list of pack indexes in your bup
repository, then searches the list for a series of
nonexistent objects, printing memory usage statistics after
each cycle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Because of the way Unix systems
work, the output will usually show a large (and unchanging)
value in the VmSize column, because mapping the index files
in the first place takes a <br>
certain amount of virtual address space. However, this
virtual memory usage is entirely virtual; it doesn&rsquo;t
take any of your RAM. Over time, bup uses parts of the
indexes, <br>
which need to be loaded from disk, and this is what causes
an increase in the VmRSS column.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-n, --number=number <br>
set the number of objects to search for during each cycle
(ie. before printing a line of output)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --cycles=cycles <br>
set the number of cycles (ie. the number of lines of output
after the first). The first line of output is always 0 (ie.
the baseline before searching for any objects).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ignore-midx <br>
ignore any .midx files created by bup midx. This allows you
to compare memory performance with and without using
midx.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--existing <br>
search for existing objects instead of searching for random
nonexistent ones. This can greatly affect memory usage and
performance. Note that most of the time, bup save <br>
spends most of its time searching for nonexistent objects,
since existing ones are probably in unmodified files that we
won&rsquo;t be trying to back up anyway. So the default <br>
behaviour reflects real bup performance more accurately. But
you might want this option anyway just to make sure you
haven&rsquo;t made searching for existing objects much <br>
worse than before.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DISCUSSION <br>
When optimizing bup indexing, the first goal is to keep the
VmRSS reasonably low. However, it might eventually be
necessary to swap in all the indexes, simply because
you&rsquo;re <br>
searching for a lot of objects, and this will cause your RSS
to grow as large as VmSize eventually.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The key word here is eventually.
As long as VmRSS grows reasonably slowly, the amount of disk
activity caused by accessing pack indexes is reasonably
small. If it grows quick&acirc; <br>
ly, bup will probably spend most of its time swapping index
data from disk instead of actually running your backup, so
backups will run very slowly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The purpose of bup memtest is to
give you an idea of how fast your memory usage is growing,
and to help in optimizing bup for better memory use. If you
have memory problems you <br>
might be asked to send the output of bup memtest to help
diagnose the problems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tip: try using bup midx -a or
bup midx -f to see if it helps reduce your memory usage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Trivia: index memory usage in
bup (or git) is only really a problem when adding a large
number of previously unseen objects. This is because for
each object, we need to abso&acirc; <br>
lutely confirm that it isn&rsquo;t already in the database,
which requires us to search through all the existing pack
indexes to ensure that none of them contain the object in
ques&acirc; <br>
tion. In the more obvious case of searching for objects that
do exist, the objects being searched for are typically
related in some way, which means they probably all exist in
a <br>
small number of packfiles, so memory usage will be
constrained to just those packfile indexes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since git users typically
don&rsquo;t add a lot of files in a single run, git
doesn&rsquo;t really need a program like bup midx. bup, on
the other hand, spends most of its time backing up <br>
files it hasn&rsquo;t seen before, so its memory usage
patterns are different.</p>
