dpic &acirc; convert pic&acirc;language input to
LaTeX&acirc;compatible and other formats</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
dpic [ -efghmprstvxz ] [ infile ] [&gt; outfile ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Typically infile is of the form
name[.pic] and outfile is of the form
name[.tex|.eps|.fig|.mp|.svg]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Dpic accepts a tight subset of the pic drawing language
accepted by GNU pic (sometimes named gpic) or AT&amp;T pic,
and emits lower&acirc;level drawing commands for insertion
into LaTeX <br>
documents, for processing by the xfig or Inkscape drawing
tools, or for direct display as encapsulated Postscript or
SVG. Arbitrary text can be inserted into the output for <br>
later formatting, and arbitrary commands for the
postprocessor (PSTricks, Tikz&acirc;pgf, etc.) can be
included. Dpic returns EXIT_SUCCESS (normally 0) if messages
no more severe than <br>
warnings were generated, otherwise EXIT_FAILURE (normally
1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A few language extensions unique
to dpic are implemented for specific purposes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LANGUAGE SUMMARY <br>
Input consists of a sequence of lines. The first line of a
picture is .PS and the last is .PE, with lines between these
two converted into low&acirc;level drawing commands for the
<br>
postprocessor chosen by the option. Lines outside of .PS ...
.PE pass through dpic unchanged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Coordinates <br>
Coordinate axes in the pic language point to the right and
up. The drawing units are inches by default but the
statement</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">scale = 25.4</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">at the beginning of the diagram
has the effect of changing the units to millimetres.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Drawn objects <br>
The primitive drawn objects consist of the planar objects
box, circle, ellipse; the linear objects line, arrow, move,
spline; and arc, which has characteristics of both planar
<br>
and linear objects. A block is a pair of square brackets
enclosing other objects: [ anything ] and is a planar
object. The complete diagram is contained implicitly in a
block.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A string is a planar object
similar to a box, but the pic language also allows strings
to be attached to other objects as overlays, in which case
they are part of the object.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The current drawing position
Here is always defined. Initially and at the beginning of a
block, Here is 0,0. Similarly, the current direction, which
can be any of up, down, <br>
left, right, is set as right initially.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each drawn object has an entry
point and exit point, which depend on the current direction.
The entry point is placed by default at the current
position. Objects can also be <br>
placed explicitly with respect to absolute coordinates or
relative to other objects. The exit point becomes the new
current position.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Labels <br>
A label in pic is an alphameric sequence that starts with an
uppercase letter. Dpic allows variables and labels to be
subscripted; thus T and T[5] are distinct labels. The <br>
value in brackets can be any expression but it is rounded to
the nearest integer value. A label gives a symbolic name to
a position or drawn object; for example,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Post: Here + (1,2) <br>
Bus[23]: line right 4</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Defined points <br>
Once drawn, a linear object has defined points .start,
.center, and .end, which can be referenced as known
positions, for example,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">L: line; line up 0.5 from
L.c</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where .center has been
abbreviated as .c</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The defined points for a planar
object are the compass points on its periphery given by .n,
.s, .e, .w, .nw, .ne, .se, .sw, together with .center, .top,
.bottom, .right, .left. <br>
For an arc, these points correspond to the circle of which
the arc is a part, with the addition of .start and .end.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A block has defined points
similar to a box, but can also have others in its interior.
Using the example</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A: [ circle; Q: [ line; circle
]; T: Q.n ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">the defined points are as
follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The points of the outer block as
if it were a box, for <br>
example, A.ne</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A position defined in the block,
for example, A.T</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The defined points of labeled
objects inside the block, <br>
preceded by a dot, for example, A.Q (the centre of <br>
block Q), or A.Q.ne (the northeast corner of Q).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The defined points of enumerated
objects inside the <br>
block, preceded by a dot (but make sure there is a space
<br>
after the dot if it is followed by a number rather than <br>
an expression in braces), for example, A.Q. 1st circle.n
<br>
or (better) A.Q.{1}st circle.n</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Language elements <br>
The lines defining a picture are separated by newline
characters or semicolons. Newlines are significant except
after then, ;, :, {, else, or newline.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A line is continued to the next
if the rightmost character is a backslash.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Non-continuation lines beginning
with a period are ignored, except for .PS and .PE lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The pic source may be commented
by placing each comment to the right of a # character
(unless the # is in a string).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The language elements include
the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A drawing command with optional
label, for example, box or A: box</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A position&acirc;label
definition, for example A: position</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An assignment to a variable, for
example x = 5</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A direction (to change the
default), for example, up</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Branching is performed by</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if expr then { dotrue } else {
dofalse }.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The looping facility is</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">for variable = expr to expr [by
[*] incr ] do { anything }.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The loop variable is incremented
by 1 by default, otherwise by incr (which may be a negative
expression) unless it is preceded by the asterisk, in which
case the loop variable is <br>
multiplied by incr. The loop variable may be changed by the
statements in the loop, thereby controlling the number of
loop repetitions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Braces occur in several
contexts. When used independently of other language
elements, as</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">{ anything }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">the left brace saves the current
position and direction, and the right brace restores them to
the saved values after the enclosed lines have been
processed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Arbitrary postprocessor commands
can be generated using</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">command string,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">which inserts the contents of
string into the output. The string contents must be
compatible with the chosen postprocessor. Similarly, any
line that begins with a backslash is <br>
copied literally to the output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The line</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">exec string</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">executes the contents of string
as if it were a normal input line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To execute operating-system
shell commands, use</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sh string</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and to read lines from an
external file, use</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">copy string</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These commands are disabled by
the dpic option -z or by a compile&acirc;time switch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print expr|position|string [
&gt; string | &gt;&gt; string ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">prints or appends its argument
to the file named in the string on the right, or by default
to the standard error. Printing to a file is disabled by the
-z option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Macros <br>
The pic language includes macro definition and expansion,
using</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">define name { anything },</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">so that, when name appears alone
or with arguments as name ( arg, ... ) then it is replaced
by the contents between the braces in the definition. A
comma in an argument list is <br>
ignored within a string or parentheses. In this
substitution, occurrences of $1 are replaced by the first
argument, and so on for other arguments. The value $+ in a
macro is <br>
the number of arguments given to the macro. dpic ignores
white space (spaces, new lines, and tab characters) that
directly precede an argument in a macro invocation. A macro
<br>
definition can be deleted by</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">undefine name</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Macro definitions are global,
which may require judicious undefinition of macros if there
is a risk of name clashes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Drawing commands <br>
An object is drawn using the following general format:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[ Label :] object [ attributes ]
[ placement ] [ strings ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The items following object can
occur in any order, but the order can make a difference to
the drawn result, since lines are read and interpreted from
left to right. Defaults are <br>
assumed for all drawing parameters as necessary. For
example, the sequence</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">circle &quot;Chew&quot;; arrow;
box &quot;Swallow&quot; <br>
line; arc cw -&gt;; ellipse &quot;Digest&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">draws a simple flow diagram
using default sizes for all objects, with centered words in
the circle, box, and ellipse.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Attributes <br>
The size and other parameters control the appearance of
objects. An attribute is a keyword or keywords with
expressions as appropriate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The dimension attributes are the
following, showing valid abbreviations:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">height|ht|width|wid|radius|rad|diameter|diam|scaled
expr</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When appended to linear objects,
height and width apply to arrowhead dimensions. The scaled
attribute scales the object by expr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The postprocessed size of a
string is unknown in advance to the pic processor, but once
known, the bounding box dimensions can be specified
explicitly as for other drawn objects, <br>
as shown:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">string wid expr ht expr</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The thickness of lines defining
an object are modified using the environmental variable
linethick or the attribute</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">thickness|thick expr</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">expressed in points. Line
thickness is independent of any scaling.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Solid lines are drawn by
default; this can be modified with</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">solid|invisible|invis</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or with</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dotted|dashed [ expr ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">the optional expression in the
latter setting the length and distance between dashes or
dots.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following attributes are for
putting arrowheads at the start, end, or both ends of a
linear object:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;-|-&gt;|&lt;-&gt; [ expr
]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The shape parameter expr may be
omitted, in which case the value of the environment variable
arrowhead is used. The default for arrow is -&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The drawing direction of an arc
is changed by the attribute</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ccw|cw</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">with ccw the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To fill an object or path with a
shade of gray, use the attribute</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fill [ expr ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where a value of 1 means white,
and 0 means black. Paths can be filled where the
postprocessor allows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Line color can be set using</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">outline|outlined string</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where the contents of the string
depend on the postprocessor. The predefined colours of LaTeX
or Tikz&acirc;pdf packages can be specified. The pic
language knows no details about <br>
color; the string contents must be compatible with the
postprocessor. Custom colors have to be defined using
the</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">command string</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">facility so that the
postprocessor will know about them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Filling by color is similar,
using the attribute</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">shaded string</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and, when both the fill and
outline colors are the same, the two attributes can be
combined as</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">colour|color|colored|coloured
string</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">in which all four spellings are
equivalent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, the attribute</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">same</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">duplicates the properties of the
previously drawn object of the same type, but with the
current default placement.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition to scale changes
effected by the scale variable, the size of the complete
picture can be set by appending one or two terms to the .PS
line as shown:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">.PS [x [y]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where x and y evaluate to
constant values. On encountering the .PE line, the picture
width w and height h are calculated. If x &gt; 0 then the
picture is scaled so that w = x. If <br>
h &gt; y &gt; 0 or if x = 0 and y &gt; 0 then the picture is
scaled so that h = y. Horizontal and vertical scaling are
not independent. Text size, line thickness, and arrowheads
are not <br>
scaled. The units are inches, so for example,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">.PS 100/25.4</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sets the final picture width to
100 mm. Printed string text may extend beyond the
rectangular boundaries defined by w and h unless the text
dimensions have been explicitly set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the final diagram width
exceeds maxpswid or the height exceeds maxpsht then the
diagram is scaled as for x and y above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Placement of drawn objects <br>
An object is placed by default so that its entry is at the
current point.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Explicit placement is obtained
with</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">object at position</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">which centers the object at
position, or</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">object with defined point at
position</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">for example,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">arc cw from position to position
with .c at position</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A block can also be positioned
by reference to a displacement from its lower left corner,
for example,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A: [ contents ] with (0.5,0.2)
at position.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Linear objects are placed by
default with the .start point placed at the current drawing
postion; otherwise linear objects are defined using a
linespec, which is of the form</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">linespec = from position | to
position | direction [ expr ] <br>
| linespec linespec <br>
| linespec then linespec</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where the second line means that
linespecs can be concatenated, and the third that
multisegment linear objects are drawn using multiple
linespecs separated by then.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As an example, the following
draws a triangle with the leftmost vertex at the current
point:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">line up 2 right 1.5 then down 3
then to Here</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Exceptionally, the linespec</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">to position to position to
...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">is multiple and does not require
the then keyword.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A single expr is also an
acceptable linespec immediately after a linear object and
means that the object is drawn to length expr in the current
direction. The exception to this <br>
is</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">spline [ expr ] linespec</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">for which the expr is a spline
tension parameter. If expr is omitted, a straight line is
drawn to the midpoint of the first two spline control points
and from the midpoint of <br>
the last two to the last point; the spline is tangent to all
midpoints between control points. If expr is present, the
spline is tangent at the first and last control points and
<br>
at all other midpoints, and the spline tension can be
adjusted. Tension values between 0 and 1 are typical.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In cases where all of the points
of a multisegment linear object are not known in advance or
inconvenient to calculate, the drawing command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">continue linespec</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will append a segment to the
previously drawn linear object as if continue were then,
with two differences. Arbitrary calculations may be done
between the previous object and <br>
the continue statement, and the current point is the exit
point of the previous object.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The construction</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">line from position to position
chop expr</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">truncates the line at each end
by the value of expr or, if expr is omitted, by the current
circle radius. Otherwise</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">line from position to position
chop expr1 chop expr2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">truncates the line by the two
specified distances at the ends. Truncation values can be
negative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The attribute</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">by position</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">is for positioning, for
example,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">move by (5,6)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Variables and expressions <br>
Variable names are alphameric sequences beginning with a
lower&acirc;case letter, optionally subscripted as for
labels, and are defined by assignment. For example, the
following line <br>
defines the variable x if it does not already exist in the
current scope:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">x = expr</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The scope of pic variables is
the current block in which they are defined, including
blocks defined later within the current block. The
assignment</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">x := expr</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">requires x to have been defined
previously in the current block or an enclosing block.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Expressions consist of
floating&acirc;point values combined using the unary
operator &quot;!&quot; for logical negation and the usual
parentheses and binary operators in decreasing order of <br>
precedence:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^ <br>
* / % <br>
+ - <br>
== != &gt;= &lt;= &lt; &gt; <br>
&amp;&amp; <br>
||</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In logical tests, the value 0 is
equivalent to false and a nonzero value to true, with
resulting true value of 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A floating&acirc;point value is
obtained as an integer, a number with e syntax, a function
value, a size value of a drawn object, for example,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">last box.ht,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or the horizontal or vertical
coordinate of a position, obtained respectively as</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">position .x|.y</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The one&acirc;argument functions
are abs, acos, asin, cos, exp, expe, int, log, loge, sign,
sin, sqrt, tan, floor. The functions exp and log are base
10. The function rand() delivers <br>
a random number between 0 and 1, and rand (expr) initializes
the random number generator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The two&acirc;argument functions
are atan2, max, min, pmod where pmod is the modulo function
delivering a positive value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Predefined environment variables
<br>
A set of predefined variables establishes the default values
of drawing parameters. Their values are inherited from the
superior block, but can be changed by assignment. They <br>
can be used in expressions like other variables. The
variables, their default values, and default uses are given
below</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">arcrad 0.25 arc radius <br>
arrowht 0.1 length of arrowhead <br>
arrowwid 0.05 width of arrowhead <br>
boxht 0.5 box height <br>
boxrad 0 radius of rounded box corners <br>
boxwid 0.75 box width <br>
circlerad 0.25 circle radius <br>
dashwid 0.05 dash length for dashed lines <br>
ellipseht 0.5 ellipse height <br>
ellipsewid 0.75 ellipse width <br>
lineht 0.5 height of vertical lines <br>
linewid 0.5 length of horizontal lines <br>
movewid 0.5 length of horizontal moves <br>
movewid 0.5 length of horizontal moves <br>
textht 0 assumed height of text <br>
textoffset 2.5/72 text justification gap <br>
textwid 0 assumed width of text</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a value is assigned to the
variable scale, all of the above values are multiplied by
the new value of scale. The drawing units are thereby
changed but the default physical <br>
sizes of drawn objects remain unchanged since, on final
output, dimensions are divided by the scale value. In
addition, the following are unchanged by scale:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">arrowhead 1 arrowhead shape <br>
fillval 0.5 fill density <br>
linethick 0.8 line thickness in points <br>
maxpsht 11.5 maximum allowed diagram height <br>
maxpswid 8.5 maximum allowed diagram width <br>
scale 1 drawing unit scale factor</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The variables maxpswid and
maxpsht may have to be redefined for large diagrams or
landscape figures, for example.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Positions <br>
A position is equivalent to a coordinate pair defined in
current drawing units, and can be expressed in the following
forms:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here <br>
The current drawing position.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">expr,expr <br>
A pair of expressions separated by a comma.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">( position ) <br>
A position in parentheses for grouping.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">( position , position ) <br>
Takes the horizontal value from the first position and <br>
the vertical value from the second.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">position +|- position <br>
Vector addition.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">position *|/ expr <br>
Scalar postmultiplication.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Label <br>
The label of a defined position or object. The position <br>
is the center of the object.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">expr [of the way] between
position and position</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The example x between A and B is
equal to A*(1-x) + B*x. <br>
Any value of expr is allowed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">expr &lt; position, position
&gt; <br>
An abbreviated equivalent of the previous form.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">number st|rd|nd|th [last] object
<br>
An enumerated object within the current block.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The object is one of</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">line, move, arrow, arc, box,
ellipse, circle, spline, [],&quot;&quot; .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The number can be <br>
replaced by { expr }. For example, last &quot;&quot; means
the <br>
last string, and {2^2}nd [] means the fourth block in the
<br>
current scope. The position is the center of the object.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Parentheses may be required when
composite positions or expressions are used in the above
forms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, a position can be
expressed as</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">object . defined point</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Strings <br>
A string is a sequence of characters enclosed in double
quotes. To include a double quote in a string, precede it
with a backslash. Strings can be concatenated using the +
oper&acirc; <br>
ator. The C&acirc;like function</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sprintf( format string, expr,
... )</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">is equivalent to a string.
Expressions are floating&acirc;point values, so the only
applicable number formats are e, f, and g.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Multiple strings such as
&quot;text1&quot; &quot;text2&quot; are stacked and centered
vertically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A string attached to an object
overlays the object at the center, and any height or width
attributes apply to the object, not the string. However, the
justification attributes <br>
ljust and rjust can be applied to the individual strings of
a stack overlaying an object.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An independent string is placed
with its center at the current point by default, or by
specifying the position of one of its defined points as for
any object, for example,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;Crunchy crackers&quot; wid
82.3/72 ht 9.7/72 with .sw at Q</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The placement qualifiers above,
below, ljust, rjust place the string above, below, or
justified with respect to the placement point. For
example,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;Crunchy crackers&quot; at
Q ljust above</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">places the string above and
textoffset units to the right of Q.</p>
