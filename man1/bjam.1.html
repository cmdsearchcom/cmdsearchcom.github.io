<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This section provides the information necessary to create
your own projects using Boost.Build The information provided
here is relatively high-level, and Chapter 6, Reference as
<br>
well as the on-line help system must be used to obtain
low-level documentation (see --help)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Boost.Build actually consists of
two parts - Boost.Jam, a build engine with its own
interpreted language, and Boost.Build itself, implemented in
Boost.Jam&rsquo;s language. The chain <br>
of events when you type bjam on the command line is as
follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Boost.Jam tries
to find Boost.Build and loads the top-level module. The
exact process is described in the section called
&acirc;Initialization&acirc;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The top-level
module loads user-defined configuration files,
user-config.jam and site-config.jam, which define available
toolsets</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The Jamfile in
the current directory is read That in turn might cause
reading of further Jamfiles. As a result, a tree of projects
is created, with targets inside projects</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Finally, using
the build request specified on the command line, Boost.Build
decides which targets should be built and how. That
information is passed back to Boost.Jam, which <br>
takes care of actually running the scheduled build action
commands</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">So, to be able to successfully
use Boost.Build, you need to know only four things:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; How to configure
Boost.Build
(http://www.boost.org/boost-build2/doc/html/bbv2/overview/configuration.html)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; How to declare
targets in Jamfiles
(http://www.boost.org/boost-build2/doc/html/bbv2/overview/targets.html)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; How the build
process works
(http://www.boost.org/boost-build2/doc/html/bbv2/overview/build_process.html)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some Basics about the Boost.Jam
language. See the section called &acirc;Boost.Jam
Language&acirc;
(http://www.boost.org/boost-build2/doc/html/bbv2/overview/jam_language.html)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONCEPTS <br>
Boost.Build has a few unique concepts that are introduced in
this section. The best way to explain the concepts is by
comparison with more classical build tools</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When using any flavour of make,
you directly specify targets and commands that are used to
create them from other target. The below example creates a.o
from a.c using a hardcoded <br>
compiler invocation command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a.o: a.c <br>
g++ -o a.o -g a.c</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is rather low-level
description mechanism and it is hard to adjust commands,
options, and sets of created targets depending on the used
compiler and operating system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To improve portability, most
modern build system provide a set of higher-level functions
that can be used in build description files. Consider this
example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">add_program (&rsquo;a&rsquo;,
&rsquo;a.c&rsquo;)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is a function call that
creates targets necessary to create executable file from
source file a.c. Depending on configured properties,
different commands line may be used. <br>
However, add_program is higher-level, but rather thin level
All targets are created immediately when build description
is parsed, which makes it impossible to perform multi- <br>
variant builds. Often, change in any build property requires
complete reconfiguration of the build tree</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to support true
multivariant builds, Boost.Build introduces the concept of
metatarget&acirc;object that is created when build
description is parsed and can be later called <br>
with specific build properties to generate actual
targets</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Consider an example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">exe a : a.cpp ;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When this declaration is parsed,
Boost.Build creates a metatarget, but does not yet decides
what files must be created, or what commands must be used.
After all build files are <br>
parsed, Boost.Build considers properties requested on the
command line. Supposed you have invoked Boost.Build
with:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bjam toolset=gcc
toolset=msvc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In that case, the metatarget
will be called twice, once with toolset=gcc and once with
toolset=msvc. Both invocations will produce concrete
targets, that will have different <br>
extensions and use different command lines. Another key
concept is build property. Build property is a variable that
affects the build process. It can be specified on the
command <br>
line, and is passed when calling a metatarget</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">While all build tools have a
similar mechanism, Boost.Build differs by requiring that all
build properties are declared in advance, and providing a
large set of properties with <br>
portable semantics</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The final concept is property
propagation. Boost.Build does not require that every
metatarget is called with the same properties. Instead, the
&rsquo;top-level&rsquo; metatargets are called <br>
with the properties specified on the command line Each
metatarget can elect to augment or override some properties
(in particular, using the requirements mechanism, see the
<br>
section called &acirc;Requirements&acirc;:
http://www.boost.org/boost-build2/doc/html/bbv2/overview/targets.html#bbv2.overview.targets.requirements)
Then, the dependency metatargets are <br>
called with modified properties and produce concrete targets
that are then used in build process Of course, dependency
metatargets maybe in turn modify build properties and have
<br>
dependencies of their own.</p>

the requirements and concepts, you may refer to SYRCoSE 2009
