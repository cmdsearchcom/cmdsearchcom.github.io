This section provides the information necessary to create your own projects
  using <i>Boost.Build</i> The information provided here is relatively
  high-level, and Chapter 6, Reference as well as the on-line help system must
  be used to obtain low-level documentation (see --help)
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Boost.Build</i> actually consists of two parts - <i>Boost.Jam</i>, a build
  engine with its own interpreted language, and <i>Boost.Build</i> itself,
  implemented in <i>Boost.Jam's</i> language. The chain of events when you type
  bjam on the command line is as follows:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><i>Boost.Jam</i> tries to find <i>Boost.Build</i> and loads
      the top-level module. The exact process is described in the section called
      &#x201C;Initialization&#x201D;</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The top-level module loads user-defined configuration
      files, <i>user-config.jam</i> and <i>site-config.jam</i>, which define
      available toolsets</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The <i>Jamfile</i> in the current directory is read That in
      turn might cause reading of further Jamfiles. As a result, a tree of
      projects is created, with targets inside projects</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Finally, using the build request specified on the command
      line, <i>Boost.Build</i> decides which targets should be built and how.
      That information is passed back to <i>Boost.Jam</i>, which takes care of
      actually running the scheduled build action commands</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
So, to be able to successfully use <i>Boost.Build</i>, you need to know only
  four things:

<div class="Pp"></div>
Some Basics about the <i>Boost.Jam</i> language. See the section called
  &#x201C;Boost.Jam Language&#x201D;
  (http://www.boost.org/boost-build2/doc/html/bbv2/overview/jam_language.html)
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CONCEPTS"><a class="selflink" href="#CONCEPTS">CONCEPTS</a></h1>
<i>Boost.Build</i> has a few unique concepts that are introduced in this
  section. The best way to explain the concepts is by comparison with more
  classical build tools
<div class="Pp"></div>
When using any flavour of make, you directly specify targets and commands that
  are used to create them from other target. The below example creates a.o from
  a.c using a hardcoded compiler invocation command
<div class="Pp"></div>
a.o: a.c
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 g++ -o a.o -g a.c
<div class="Pp"></div>
This is rather low-level description mechanism and it is hard to adjust
  commands, options, and sets of created targets depending on the used compiler
  and operating system.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To improve portability, most modern build system provide a set of higher-level
  functions that can be used in build description files. Consider this example:
<div class="Pp"></div>
add_program ('a', 'a.c')
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This is a function call that creates targets necessary to create executable file
  from source file a.c. Depending on configured properties, different commands
  line may be used. However, <i>add_program</i> is higher-level, but rather thin
  level All targets are created immediately when build description is parsed,
  which makes it impossible to perform multi-variant builds. Often, change in
  any build property requires complete reconfiguration of the build tree
<div class="Pp"></div>
In order to support true multivariant builds, Boost.Build introduces the concept
  of metatarget&#x2014;object that is created when build description is parsed
  and can be later called with specific build properties to generate actual
  targets
<div class="Pp"></div>
Consider an example:
<div class="Pp"></div>
exe a : a.cpp ;
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
When this declaration is parsed, <i>Boost.Build</i> creates a metatarget, but
  does not yet decides what files must be created, or what commands must be
  used. After all build files are parsed, Boost.Build considers properties
  requested on the command line. Supposed you have invoked <i>Boost.Build</i>
  with:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>bjam</i> toolset=gcc toolset=msvc
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
In that case, the metatarget will be called twice, once with toolset=gcc and
  once with toolset=msvc. Both invocations will produce concrete targets, that
  will have different extensions and use different command lines. Another key
  concept is build property. Build property is a variable that affects the build
  process. It can be specified on the command line, and is passed when calling a
  metatarget
<div class="Pp"></div>
While all build tools have a similar mechanism, <i>Boost.Build</i> differs by
  requiring that all build properties are declared in advance, and providing a
  large set of properties with portable semantics
<div class="Pp"></div>
The final concept is property propagation. Boost.Build does not require that
  every metatarget is called with the same properties. Instead, the 'top-level'
  metatargets are called with the properties specified on the command line Each
  metatarget can elect to augment or override some properties (in particular,
  using the requirements mechanism, see the section called
  &#x201C;Requirements&#x201D;:
  http://www.boost.org/boost-build2/doc/html/bbv2/overview/targets.html#bbv2.overview.targets.requirements)
  Then, the dependency metatargets are called with modified properties and
  produce concrete targets that are then used in build process Of course,
  dependency metatargets maybe in turn modify build properties and have
  dependencies of their own.
<div class="Pp"></div>
