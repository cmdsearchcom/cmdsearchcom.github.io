<p>WRITE(1) BSD General Commands Manual WRITE(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
write &acirc; send a message to another user</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
write user [tty]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The write utility allows you to communicate with other
users, by copying lines from your terminal to theirs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When you run the write command,
the user you are writing to gets a message of the form:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Message from yourname@yourhost
on yourtty at hh:mm ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any further lines you enter will
be copied to the specified user&rsquo;s terminal. If the
other user wants to reply, they must run write as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When you are done, type an
end-of-file or interrupt character. The other user will see
the message &acirc;EOF&acirc; indicating that the
conversation is over.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can prevent people (other
than the super-user) from writing to you with the mesg(1)
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the user you want to write to
is logged in on more than one terminal, you can specify
which terminal to write to by specifying the terminal name
as the second operand to the <br>
write command. Alternatively, you can let write select one
of the terminals - it will pick the one with the shortest
idle time. This is so that if the user is logged in at work
<br>
and also dialed up from home, the message will go to the
right place.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The traditional protocol for
writing to someone is that the string &acirc;-o&acirc;,
either at the end of a line or on a line by itself, means
that it is the other person&rsquo;s turn to talk. The <br>
string &acirc;oo&acirc; means that the person believes the
conversation to be over.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
mesg(1), talk(1), wall(1), who(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY <br>
A write command appeared in Version 1 AT&amp;T UNIX.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
The sender&rsquo;s LC_CTYPE setting is used to determine
which characters are safe to write to a terminal, not the
receiver&rsquo;s (which write has no way of knowing).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The write utility does not
recognize multibyte characters.</p>
