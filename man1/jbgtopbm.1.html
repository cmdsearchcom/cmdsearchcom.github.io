<p>JBGTOPBM(1) General Commands Manual JBGTOPBM(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
jbgtopbm - JBIG1 to portable bitmap file converter</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
jbgtopbm [ options ] [ input-file | - [ output-file ]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Reads in a JBIG1 bi-level image entity (BIE) from a file or
standard input, decompresses it, and outputs a portable
bitmap (PBM) file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">JBIG1 is a highly effective
lossless compression algorithm for bi-level images (one bit
per pixel), which is particularly suitable for scanned
document pages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A JBIG1 encoded image can be
stored in several resolutions in one or several BIEs. All
resolution layers except the lowest one are stored
efficiently as differences to the next <br>
lower resolution layer. Options -x and -y can be used to
stop the decompression at a specified maximal output image
size. With option -m the input file can consist of multiple
<br>
concatenated BIEs which contain different increasing
resolution layers of the same image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If more than one bit per pixel
is stored in the JBIG1 file, then a PGM file will be
produced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
- A single hyphen instead of an input file name will cause
jbgtopbm to read the data from standard input instead from a
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x number Decode only up to the
largest resolution layer which is still not more than number
pixels wide. If no such resolution layer exists, then use
the smallest one avail&acirc; <br>
able.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-y number Decode only up to the
largest resolution layer which is still not more than number
pixels high. If no such resolution layer exists, then use
the smallest one avail&acirc; <br>
able. Options -x and -y can also be used together in which
case the largest layer that satisfies both limits will be
selected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m Process multiple concatenated
BIEs. If there are bytes left after the final SDE in the
first BIE, then with this option jbgtopbm will attempt to
decode these as the <br>
start of another BIE that may contain higher resolution
data. Normally, any remaining bytes will generate a warning
message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b Use binary values instead of
Gray code words in order to decode pixel values from
multiple bitplanes. This option has only an effect if the
input has more than one <br>
bitplane and a PGM output file is produced. Note that the
decoder has to be used in the same mode as the encoder and
cannot determine from the BIE, whether Gray or <br>
binary code words were used by the encoder.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Diagnose a single BIE. With
this option, jbgtopbm will print a summary of the header
information found in the input file, followed by a list of
all PSCD and ESC <br>
marker sequences encountered until the end of the file is
reached.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p number If the input contains
multiple bitplanes, then extract only the specified single
plane as a PBM file. The first plane has number 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Using standard input and standard output for binary data
works only on systems where there is no difference between
binary and text streams (e.g., Unix). On other systems
(e.g., <br>
MS-DOS), using standard input or standard output may cause
control characters like CR or LF to be inserted or deleted
and this will damage the binary data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STANDARDS <br>
This program implements the JBIG1 image coding algorithm as
specified in ISO/IEC 11544:1993 and ITU-T T.82(1993).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHOR <br>
The jbgtopbm program is part of the JBIG-KIT package, which
has been developed by Markus Kuhn. The most recent version
of this portable JBIG1 library and tools set is available
<br>
from &lt;http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/jbigkit/&gt;.</p>
