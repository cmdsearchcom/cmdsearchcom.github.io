<p>GIT-PULL(1) Git Manual GIT-PULL(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
git-pull - Fetch from and merge with another repository or a
local branch</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
git pull [options] [&lt;repository&gt;
[&lt;refspec&gt;...]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Incorporates changes from a remote repository into the
current branch. In its default mode, git pull is shorthand
for git fetch followed by git merge FETCH_HEAD.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">More precisely, git pull runs
git fetch with the given parameters and calls git merge to
merge the retrieved branch heads into the current branch.
With --rebase, it runs git <br>
rebase instead of git merge.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;repository&gt; should be the
name of a remote repository as passed to git-fetch(1).
&lt;refspec&gt; can name an arbitrary remote ref (for
example, the name of a tag) or even a collection <br>
of refs with corresponding remote-tracking branches (e.g.,
refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*), but usually it is the
name of a branch in the remote repository.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default values for
&lt;repository&gt; and &lt;branch&gt; are read from the
&quot;remote&quot; and &quot;merge&quot; configuration for
the current branch as set by git-branch(1) --track.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Assume the following history
exists and the current branch is &quot;master&quot;:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A---B---C master on origin <br>
/ <br>
D---E---F---G master</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Then &quot;git pull&quot; will
fetch and replay the changes from the remote master branch
since it diverged from the local master (i.e., E) until its
current commit (C) on top of master <br>
and record the result in a new commit along with the names
of the two parent commits and a log message from the user
describing the changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A---B---C remotes/origin/master
<br>
/ D---E---F---G---H master</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See git-merge(1) for details,
including how conflicts are presented and handled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In Git 1.7.0 or later, to cancel
a conflicting merge, use git reset --merge. Warning: In
older versions of Git, running git pull with uncommitted
changes is discouraged: while <br>
possible, it leaves you in a state that may be hard to back
out of in the case of a conflict.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If any of the remote changes
overlap with local uncommitted changes, the merge will be
automatically cancelled and the work tree untouched. It is
generally best to get any local <br>
changes in working order before pulling or stash them away
with git-stash(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Options meant for git pull itself and the underlying git
merge must be given before the options meant for git
fetch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q, --quiet <br>
This is passed to both underlying git-fetch to squelch
reporting of during transfer, and underlying git-merge to
squelch output during merging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
Pass --verbose to git-fetch and git-merge.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--[no-]recurse-submodules[=yes|on-demand|no]
<br>
This option controls if new commits of all populated
submodules should be fetched too (see git-config(1) and
gitmodules(5)). That might be necessary to get the data
needed <br>
for merging submodule commits, a feature Git learned in
1.7.3. Notice that the result of a merge will not be checked
out in the submodule, &quot;git submodule update&quot; has
to be <br>
called afterwards to bring the work tree up to date with the
merge result.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options related to merging <br>
--commit, --no-commit <br>
Perform the merge and commit the result. This option can be
used to override --no-commit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With --no-commit perform the
merge but pretend the merge failed and do not autocommit, to
give the user a chance to inspect and further tweak the
merge result before <br>
committing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--edit, --no-edit <br>
Invoke an editor before committing successful mechanical
merge to further edit the auto-generated merge message, so
that the user can explain and justify the merge. The <br>
--no-edit option can be used to accept the auto-generated
message (this is generally discouraged). The --edit option
is still useful if you are giving a draft message with <br>
the -m option from the command line and want to edit it in
the editor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Older scripts may depend on the
historical behaviour of not allowing the user to edit the
merge log message. They will see an editor opened when they
run git merge. To make <br>
it easier to adjust such scripts to the updated behaviour,
the environment variable GIT_MERGE_AUTOEDIT can be set to no
at the beginning of them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ff <br>
When the merge resolves as a fast-forward, only update the
branch pointer, without creating a merge commit. This is the
default behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-ff <br>
Create a merge commit even when the merge resolves as a
fast-forward. This is the default behaviour when merging an
annotated (and possibly signed) tag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ff-only <br>
Refuse to merge and exit with a non-zero status unless the
current HEAD is already up-to-date or the merge can be
resolved as a fast-forward.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--log[=&lt;n&gt;], --no-log <br>
In addition to branch names, populate the log message with
one-line descriptions from at most &lt;n&gt; actual commits
that are being merged. See also git-fmt-merge-msg(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With --no-log do not list
one-line descriptions from the actual commits being
merged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--stat, -n, --no-stat <br>
Show a diffstat at the end of the merge. The diffstat is
also controlled by the configuration option merge.stat.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With -n or --no-stat do not show
a diffstat at the end of the merge.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--squash, --no-squash <br>
Produce the working tree and index state as if a real merge
happened (except for the merge information), but do not
actually make a commit or move the HEAD, nor record <br>
$GIT_DIR/MERGE_HEAD to cause the next git commit command to
create a merge commit. This allows you to create a single
commit on top of the current branch whose effect is the <br>
same as merging another branch (or more in case of an
octopus).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With --no-squash perform the
merge and commit the result. This option can be used to
override --squash.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s &lt;strategy&gt;,
--strategy=&lt;strategy&gt; <br>
Use the given merge strategy; can be supplied more than once
to specify them in the order they should be tried. If there
is no -s option, a built-in list of strategies is <br>
used instead (git merge-recursive when merging a single
head, git merge-octopus otherwise).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X &lt;option&gt;,
--strategy-option=&lt;option&gt; <br>
Pass merge strategy specific option through to the merge
strategy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--verify-signatures,
--no-verify-signatures <br>
Verify that the commits being merged have good and trusted
GPG signatures and abort the merge in case they do not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--summary, --no-summary <br>
Synonyms to --stat and --no-stat; these are deprecated and
will be removed in the future.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q, --quiet <br>
Operate quietly. Implies --no-progress.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
Be verbose.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--progress, --no-progress <br>
Turn progress on/off explicitly. If neither is specified,
progress is shown if standard error is connected to a
terminal. Note that not all merge strategies may support
<br>
progress reporting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, --rebase <br>
Rebase the current branch on top of the upstream branch
after fetching. If there is a remote-tracking branch
corresponding to the upstream branch and the upstream branch
was <br>
rebased since last fetched, the rebase uses that information
to avoid rebasing non-local changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See pull.rebase,
branch.&lt;name&gt;.rebase and branch.autosetuprebase in
git-config(1) if you want to make git pull always use
--rebase instead of merging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note <br>
This is a potentially dangerous mode of operation. It
rewrites history, which does not bode well when you
published that history already. Do not use this option
unless <br>
you have read git-rebase(1) carefully.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-rebase <br>
Override earlier --rebase.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options related to fetching <br>
--all <br>
Fetch all remotes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a, --append <br>
Append ref names and object names of fetched refs to the
existing contents of .git/FETCH_HEAD. Without this option
old data in .git/FETCH_HEAD will be overwritten.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--depth=&lt;depth&gt; <br>
Deepen or shorten the history of a shallow repository
created by git clone with --depth=&lt;depth&gt; option (see
git-clone(1)) to the specified number of commits from the
tip of <br>
each remote branch history. Tags for the deepened commits
are not fetched.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--unshallow <br>
Convert a shallow repository to a complete one, removing all
the limitations imposed by shallow repositories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, --force <br>
When git fetch is used with &lt;rbranch&gt;:&lt;lbranch&gt;
refspec, it refuses to update the local branch
&lt;lbranch&gt; unless the remote branch &lt;rbranch&gt; it
fetches is a descendant of <br>
&lt;lbranch&gt;. This option overrides that check.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k, --keep <br>
Keep downloaded pack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-tags <br>
By default, tags that point at objects that are downloaded
from the remote repository are fetched and stored locally.
This option disables this automatic tag following. The <br>
default behavior for a remote may be specified with the
remote.&lt;name&gt;.tagopt setting. See git-config(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u, --update-head-ok <br>
By default git fetch refuses to update the head which
corresponds to the current branch. This flag disables the
check. This is purely for the internal use for git pull to
<br>
communicate with git fetch, and unless you are implementing
your own Porcelain you are not supposed to use it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--upload-pack
&lt;upload-pack&gt; <br>
When given, and the repository to fetch from is handled by
git fetch-pack, --exec=&lt;upload-pack&gt; is passed to the
command to specify non-default path for the command run on
<br>
the other end.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--progress <br>
Progress status is reported on the standard error stream by
default when it is attached to a terminal, unless -q is
specified. This flag forces progress status even if the <br>
standard error stream is not directed to a terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;repository&gt; <br>
The &quot;remote&quot; repository that is the source of a
fetch or pull operation. This parameter can be either a URL
(see the section GIT URLS below) or the name of a remote
(see the <br>
section REMOTES below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;refspec&gt; <br>
The format of a &lt;refspec&gt; parameter is an optional
plus +, followed by the source ref &lt;src&gt;, followed by
a colon :, followed by the destination ref &lt;dst&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The remote ref that matches
&lt;src&gt; is fetched, and if &lt;dst&gt; is not empty
string, the local ref that matches it is fast-forwarded
using &lt;src&gt;. If the optional plus + is used, <br>
the local ref is updated even if it does not result in a
fast-forward update.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note <br>
If the remote branch from which you want to pull is modified
in non-linear ways such as being rewound and rebased
frequently, then a pull will attempt a merge with an <br>
older version of itself, likely conflict, and fail. It is
under these conditions that you would want to use the + sign
to indicate non-fast-forward updates will be <br>
needed. There is currently no easy way to determine or
declare that a branch will be made available in a repository
with this behavior; the pulling user simply must know <br>
this is the expected usage pattern for a branch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note <br>
You never do your own development on branches that appear on
the right hand side of a &lt;refspec&gt; colon on Pull:
lines; they are to be updated by git fetch. If you intend
<br>
to do development derived from a remote branch B, have a
Pull: line to track it (i.e. Pull: B:remote-B), and have a
separate branch my-B to do your development on top of <br>
it. The latter is created by git branch my-B remote-B (or
its equivalent git checkout -b my-B remote-B). Run git fetch
to keep track of the progress of the remote side, <br>
and when you see something new on the remote branch, merge
it into your development branch with git pull . remote-B,
while you are on my-B branch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note <br>
There is a difference between listing multiple
&lt;refspec&gt; directly on git pull command line and having
multiple Pull: &lt;refspec&gt; lines for a
&lt;repository&gt; and running git <br>
pull command without any explicit &lt;refspec&gt;
parameters. &lt;refspec&gt; listed explicitly on the command
line are always merged into the current branch after
fetching. In other <br>
words, if you list more than one remote refs, you would be
making an Octopus. While git pull run without any explicit
&lt;refspec&gt; parameter takes default &lt;refspec&gt;s
from <br>
Pull: lines, it merges only the first &lt;refspec&gt; found
into the current branch, after fetching all the remote refs.
This is because making an Octopus from remote refs is <br>
rarely done, while keeping track of multiple remote heads in
one-go by fetching more than one is often useful. <br>
Some short-cut notations are also supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; tag &lt;tag&gt;
means the same as
refs/tags/&lt;tag&gt;:refs/tags/&lt;tag&gt;; it requests
fetching everything up to the given tag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A parameter
&lt;ref&gt; without a colon is equivalent to &lt;ref&gt;:
when pulling/fetching, so it merges &lt;ref&gt; into the
current branch without storing the remote branch anywhere
<br>
locally</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GIT URLS <br>
In general, URLs contain information about the transport
protocol, the address of the remote server, and the path to
the repository. Depending on the transport protocol, some of
<br>
this information may be absent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Git supports ssh, git, http, and
https protocols (in addition, ftp, and ftps can be used for
fetching and rsync can be used for fetching and pushing, but
these are inefficient <br>
and deprecated; do not use them).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following syntaxes may be
used with them:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
ssh://[user@]host.xz[:port]/path/to/repo.git/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
git://host.xz[:port]/path/to/repo.git/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
http[s]://host.xz[:port]/path/to/repo.git/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
ftp[s]://host.xz[:port]/path/to/repo.git/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
rsync://host.xz/path/to/repo.git/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An alternative scp-like syntax
may also be used with the ssh protocol:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
[user@]host.xz:path/to/repo.git/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ssh and git protocols
additionally support ~username expansion:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
ssh://[user@]host.xz[:port]/~[user]/path/to/repo.git/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
git://host.xz[:port]/~[user]/path/to/repo.git/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
[user@]host.xz:/~[user]/path/to/repo.git/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For local repositories, also
supported by Git natively, the following syntaxes may be
used:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
/path/to/repo.git/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
file:///path/to/repo.git/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These two syntaxes are mostly
equivalent, except when cloning, when the former implies
--local option. See git-clone(1) for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When Git doesn&acirc;t know how
to handle a certain transport protocol, it attempts to use
the remote-&lt;transport&gt; remote helper, if one exists.
To explicitly request a remote helper, <br>
the following syntax may be used:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&lt;transport&gt;::&lt;address&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where &lt;address&gt; may be a
path, a server and path, or an arbitrary URL-like string
recognized by the specific remote helper being invoked. See
gitremote-helpers(1) for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If there are a large number of
similarly-named remote repositories and you want to use a
different format for them (such that the URLs you use will
be rewritten into URLs that <br>
work), you can create a configuration section of the
form:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[url &quot;&lt;actual url
base&gt;&quot;] <br>
insteadOf = &lt;other url base&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, with this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[url
&quot;git://git.host.xz/&quot;] <br>
insteadOf = host.xz:/path/to/ <br>
insteadOf = work:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a URL like
&quot;work:repo.git&quot; or like
&quot;host.xz:/path/to/repo.git&quot; will be rewritten in
any context that takes a URL to be
&quot;git://git.host.xz/repo.git&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to rewrite URLs for
push only, you can create a configuration section of the
form:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[url &quot;&lt;actual url
base&gt;&quot;] <br>
pushInsteadOf = &lt;other url base&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, with this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[url
&quot;ssh://example.org/&quot;] <br>
pushInsteadOf = git://example.org/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a URL like
&quot;git://example.org/path/to/repo.git&quot; will be
rewritten to &quot;ssh://example.org/path/to/repo.git&quot;
for pushes, but pulls will still use the original URL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REMOTES <br>
The name of one of the following can be used instead of a
URL as &lt;repository&gt; argument:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; a remote in the
Git configuration file: $GIT_DIR/config,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; a file in the
$GIT_DIR/remotes directory, or</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; a file in the
$GIT_DIR/branches directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All of these also allow you to
omit the refspec from the command line because they each
contain a refspec which git will use by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Named remote in configuration
file <br>
You can choose to provide the name of a remote which you had
previously configured using git-remote(1), git-config(1) or
even by a manual edit to the $GIT_DIR/config file. The <br>
URL of this remote will be used to access the repository.
The refspec of this remote will be used by default when you
do not provide a refspec on the command line. The entry in
<br>
the config file would appear like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[remote
&quot;&lt;name&gt;&quot;] <br>
url = &lt;url&gt; <br>
pushurl = &lt;pushurl&gt; <br>
push = &lt;refspec&gt; <br>
fetch = &lt;refspec&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &lt;pushurl&gt; is used for
pushes only. It is optional and defaults to &lt;url&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Named file in $GIT_DIR/remotes
<br>
You can choose to provide the name of a file in
$GIT_DIR/remotes. The URL in this file will be used to
access the repository. The refspec in this file will be used
as default <br>
when you do not provide a refspec on the command line. This
file should have the following format:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">URL: one of the above URL format
<br>
Push: &lt;refspec&gt; <br>
Pull: &lt;refspec&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Push: lines are used by git push
and Pull: lines are used by git pull and git fetch. Multiple
Push: and Pull: lines may be specified for additional branch
mappings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Named file in $GIT_DIR/branches
<br>
You can choose to provide the name of a file in
$GIT_DIR/branches. The URL in this file will be used to
access the repository. This file should have the following
format:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;url&gt;#&lt;head&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;url&gt; is required;
#&lt;head&gt; is optional.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Depending on the operation, git
will use one of the following refspecs, if you don&acirc;t
provide one on the command line. &lt;branch&gt; is the name
of this file in $GIT_DIR/branches and <br>
&lt;head&gt; defaults to master.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">git fetch uses:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">refs/heads/&lt;head&gt;:refs/heads/&lt;branch&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">git push uses:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">HEAD:refs/heads/&lt;head&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MERGE STRATEGIES <br>
The merge mechanism (git-merge and git-pull commands) allows
the backend merge strategies to be chosen with -s option.
Some strategies can also take their own options, which can
<br>
be passed by giving -X&lt;option&gt; arguments to git-merge
and/or git-pull.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">resolve <br>
This can only resolve two heads (i.e. the current branch and
another branch you pulled from) using a 3-way merge
algorithm. It tries to carefully detect criss-cross merge
<br>
ambiguities and is considered generally safe and fast.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">recursive <br>
This can only resolve two heads using a 3-way merge
algorithm. When there is more than one common ancestor that
can be used for 3-way merge, it creates a merged tree of the
<br>
common ancestors and uses that as the reference tree for the
3-way merge. This has been reported to result in fewer merge
conflicts without causing mis-merges by tests done <br>
on actual merge commits taken from Linux 2.6 kernel
development history. Additionally this can detect and handle
merges involving renames. This is the default merge strategy
<br>
when pulling or merging one branch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The recursive strategy can take
the following options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ours <br>
This option forces conflicting hunks to be auto-resolved
cleanly by favoring our version. Changes from the other tree
that do not conflict with our side are reflected to <br>
the merge result. For a binary file, the entire contents are
taken from our side.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This should not be confused with
the ours merge strategy, which does not even look at what
the other tree contains at all. It discards everything the
other tree did, <br>
declaring our history contains all that happened in it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">theirs <br>
This is the opposite of ours.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">patience <br>
With this option, merge-recursive spends a little extra time
to avoid mismerges that sometimes occur due to unimportant
matching lines (e.g., braces from distinct <br>
functions). Use this when the branches to be merged have
diverged wildly. See also git-diff(1)--patience.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">diff-algorithm=[patience|minimal|histogram|myers]
<br>
Tells merge-recursive to use a different diff algorithm,
which can help avoid mismerges that occur due to unimportant
matching lines (such as braces from distinct <br>
functions). See also git-diff(1)--diff-algorithm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ignore-space-change,
ignore-all-space, ignore-space-at-eol <br>
Treats lines with the indicated type of whitespace change as
unchanged for the sake of a three-way merge. Whitespace
changes mixed with other changes to a line are not <br>
ignored. See also git-diff(1)-b, -w, and
--ignore-space-at-eol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If their version
only introduces whitespace changes to a line, our version is
used;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If our version
introduces whitespace changes but their version includes a
substantial change, their version is used;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Otherwise, the
merge proceeds in the usual way.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">renormalize <br>
This runs a virtual check-out and check-in of all three
stages of a file when resolving a three-way merge. This
option is meant to be used when merging branches with <br>
different clean filters or end-of-line normalization rules.
See &quot;Merging branches with differing checkin/checkout
attributes&quot; in gitattributes(5) for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">no-renormalize <br>
Disables the renormalize option. This overrides the
merge.renormalize configuration variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rename-threshold=&lt;n&gt; <br>
Controls the similarity threshold used for rename detection.
See also git-diff(1)-M.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">subtree[=&lt;path&gt;] <br>
This option is a more advanced form of subtree strategy,
where the strategy makes a guess on how two trees must be
shifted to match with each other when merging. Instead, <br>
the specified path is prefixed (or stripped from the
beginning) to make the shape of two trees to match.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">octopus <br>
This resolves cases with more than two heads, but refuses to
do a complex merge that needs manual resolution. It is
primarily meant to be used for bundling topic branch heads
<br>
together. This is the default merge strategy when pulling or
merging more than one branch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ours <br>
This resolves any number of heads, but the resulting tree of
the merge is always that of the current branch head,
effectively ignoring all changes from all other branches. It
<br>
is meant to be used to supersede old development history of
side branches. Note that this is different from the -Xours
option to the recursive merge strategy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">subtree <br>
This is a modified recursive strategy. When merging trees A
and B, if B corresponds to a subtree of A, B is first
adjusted to match the tree structure of A, instead of <br>
reading the trees at the same level. This adjustment is also
done to the common ancestor tree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEFAULT BEHAVIOUR <br>
Often people use git pull without giving any parameter.
Traditionally, this has been equivalent to saying git pull
origin. However, when configuration
branch.&lt;name&gt;.remote is <br>
present while on branch &lt;name&gt;, that value is used
instead of origin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to determine what URL
to use to fetch from, the value of the configuration
remote.&lt;origin&gt;.url is consulted and if there is not
any such variable, the value on URL: &lsquo; <br>
line in &lsquo;$GIT_DIR/remotes/&lt;origin&gt; file is
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to determine what
remote branches to fetch (and optionally store in the
remote-tracking branches) when the command is run without
any refspec parameters on the command <br>
line, values of the configuration variable
remote.&lt;origin&gt;.fetch are consulted, and if there
aren&acirc;t any, $GIT_DIR/remotes/&lt;origin&gt; file is
consulted and its &lsquo;Pull: &lsquo; lines are <br>
used. In addition to the refspec formats described in the
OPTIONS section, you can have a globbing refspec that looks
like this:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A globbing refspec must have a
non-empty RHS (i.e. must store what were fetched in
remote-tracking branches), and its LHS and RHS must end with
/*. The above specifies that all <br>
remote branches are tracked using remote-tracking branches
in refs/remotes/origin/ hierarchy under the same name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The rule to determine which
remote branch to merge after fetching is a bit involved, in
order not to break backward compatibility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If explicit refspecs were given
on the command line of git pull, they are all merged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When no refspec was given on the
command line, then git pull uses the refspec from the
configuration or $GIT_DIR/remotes/&lt;origin&gt;. In such
cases, the following rules apply:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. If branch.&lt;name&gt;.merge
configuration for the current branch &lt;name&gt; exists,
that is the name of the branch at the remote site that is
merged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. If the refspec is a globbing
one, nothing is merged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. Otherwise the remote branch
of the first refspec is merged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
&Acirc;&middot; Update the remote-tracking branches for the
repository you cloned from, then merge one of them into your
current branch:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git pull, git pull origin</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normally the branch merged in is
the HEAD of the remote repository, but the choice is
determined by the branch.&lt;name&gt;.remote and
branch.&lt;name&gt;.merge options; see git- <br>
config(1) for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Merge into the
current branch the remote branch next:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git pull origin next</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This leaves a copy of next
temporarily in FETCH_HEAD, but does not update any
remote-tracking branches. Using remote-tracking branches,
the same can be done by invoking fetch <br>
and merge:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git fetch origin <br>
$ git merge origin/next</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you tried a pull which
resulted in complex conflicts and would want to start over,
you can recover with git reset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Using --recurse-submodules can only fetch new commits in
already checked out submodules right now. When e.g. upstream
added a new submodule in the just fetched commits of the
<br>
superproject the submodule itself can not be fetched, making
it impossible to check out that submodule later without
having to do a fetch again. This is expected to be fixed in
a <br>
future Git version.</p>
