<p>MANILIST(1) General Commands Manual MANILIST(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
manilist - report status of files in a source directory</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
manilist [ -abcdhnptV ] [ -i extension ] [ -f manifest ] [
-p format ] [ -s string ] [ -w which ] [ -x extension ] [ -C
separator ] [ -I included ] [ -L colsize ] [ -X excluded ]
<br>
[ files or directories ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Manilist scans a source directory and produces a report on
the status of each file: whether it is up-to-date or not
with respect to patchlevel.h , if it is missing from
MANI&acirc; <br>
FEST.new, and some other useful information which may be
dynamically configured. It can be use to maintain a
MANIFEST.new file, produce a detailed listing and status of
a group <br>
of directories, etc... The rich set of options concur to
make manilist a perfect low-level tool.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Under its simplest invocation
form at the top level directory of a package, with no
arguments, manilist will scan the MANIFEST.new and produce a
report on the status of each file <br>
listed there. Each line starts with a single character flag
which indicates the state of the file, followed by the name
of the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">What happens in fact is more
complex than that. Manilist scans the MANIFEST.new file and
then loops over all the files listed there. Internally,
manilist maintains an inclusion <br>
and an exclusion list, both specifying extensions for files.
For instance, the inclusion list could be (&rsquo;.c&rsquo;,
&rsquo;.h&rsquo;) and the exclusion (&rsquo;.o&rsquo;,
&rsquo;,v&rsquo;) so that C sources are included <br>
and object or RCS files excluded. By default, all files but
those excluded are used. Some other selections may be
applied at this stage, as will be explained later on. For
those <br>
files which pass this selection process, a report is issued
according to a report format, which by default is &quot;A:%c
%n&quot;. The letter A (or anything before the initial
&rsquo;:&rsquo; charac&acirc; <br>
ter is the file selection specification we&rsquo;ve been
talking about. The remaining is the formatting, a string
which is printed as-is, modulo some escape sequences. It so
happens <br>
that %c is the character flag and %n is the name of the
current file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Generally speaking, manilist
should be regarded as a tool which emits configurable
reports on a set of files, selectively picking them among a
list or by directly scanning the <br>
directories to see what&rsquo;s out there...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By specifying a set of
directories or files as arguments on the command line, you
restrict the scanning area, limiting to reports concerning
those files or directories. If you do <br>
not specify any, manilist restricts its report to the
current directory and its subdirectories, unless the -t
option is given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Manilist recognizes the following options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a Make a report for all the
files, regardless of what is specified by the included and
excluded suffix lists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b Assume current directory is
the base (root) of the package tree. When this option is not
specified, manilist will look for a .package file to
indicate the root <br>
directory of the package (also called the top) and complain
if it does not find it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Check files against those
listed in MANIFEST.new (or whatever file specified via the
-f option) and report discrepancies via the %c macro.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Dump included and excluded
suffix lists on stderr, extensions being space separated. A
good way to know the default lists is to run: manilist -f
/dev/null -bd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f manifest Specify an alternate
manifest file, the default being to use MANIFEST.new.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Print the usage help message
and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i extensions Add new extensions
to the included suffix list. The extensions argument must
list the suffixes separated by spaces, as in -i &rsquo;.ph
.pl&rsquo; to add both .ph and .pl to <br>
the existing suffixes. Note that the argument needs to be
quoted to protect spaces against shell interpretation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Do not use any manifest file.
Rather scan the directories and act as with all the files
there were already listed in a manifest.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p format Set the new printing
format, which has the form selection:string, with selection
being a list of single letters specifying which files from
the manifest are to be <br>
used for reports, and string being a message to print as
report, with some macro substitutions. It is also possible
to have column formatting by specifying a &rsquo;|&rsquo;
<br>
inside the string to delimit the different columns you wish
to see. See also -C and -L for more formatting
parameters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s string Specify the string
part of the printing format (see -p for a general
description of the format). Available macros are listed
further down the manual page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Start from the top directory
(the root directory of the distribution) regardless of the
current directory. There must be a .package file to indicate
what the top <br>
directory is.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w selection Specifiy the
selection part of the printing format. Available selections
will be discussed later.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x extensions Add new extensions
to the excluded suffix list. The extensions argument must
list the suffixes separated by spaces, as in -x &rsquo;.s
.p&rsquo; to add both .s and .p to the <br>
existing list. Note that the argument needs to be quoted to
protect spaces against shell interpretation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C separator Give the column
separator, which is to be used in place of the
&rsquo;|&rsquo; character in the report format string. By
default, it is a single space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I included Specify a new list
of suffixes to be included in the reports. This overrides
the original default list (whereas -i is used to add
suffixes to the list). Suffixes <br>
must be space separated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L colsize When using column
formatting (the &rsquo;|&rsquo; character being used to
denote columns), this option may be used to specify the
maximum column width, separating each width <br>
by a single &rsquo;,&rsquo;. Leaving a width unspecified
does not impose any limit on its width. For instance, if the
format string is %n|%d|%t, one could limit the middle <br>
column (descriptions from MANIFEST.new) to 40 characters and
the name column (first one) to 15 characters, leaving the
last one with no imposed limits, by using -L <br>
15,40,.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Print version number and
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X excluded Specify a new list
of suffixes to be excluded in the reports. This overrides
the original default list (whereas -x is used to add
suffixes to the list). Suffixes <br>
must be space separated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USING FORMATS <br>
The flexibility of manilist is brought by its use of a
dynamic formatting string for providing its reports. It is
possible to specify a format via the -p option or just parts
of <br>
it: the text string via -s and the file selection with
-w.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File Selection <br>
The leading part of the formatting string tells manilist
which files you wish to see in the final report. Available
selectors are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A All the files but the excluded
ones (i.e. those files whose suffix is listed in the
exclusion list). This is the default action. <br>
a All the files included and/or excluded (shortcut for ix).
Note that files which are neither included nor excluded will
not appear in the report. <br>
d Report only for directories. <br>
f Report only for files. <br>
i Only included files are listed. <br>
m Only those files or directories found in the manifest are
listed. <br>
n Only those files or directories not found in the manifest
are listed. <br>
x Only excluded files are listed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When you specify more than one
letter, the resulting report depends on the nature of the
selection. For d, f, m and n, a logical union is performed.
This means specifying fd or <br>
mn is the same as not specifying anything, but it&rsquo;s
less efficient since manilist is forced to perform the
checks it would otherwise bypass. The i and x selectors are
special: by <br>
default, all the files not excluded are reported. Specifying
x also asks for excluded files. Specifying i restricts the
report to the included files. Using both at the same time
<br>
(ix) will force a report for files which are included or
excluded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Macro Substitution <br>
The string part of the report format can make use of the
following macros:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%c A character coding the status
of the file. <br>
%d Description from the manifest file, if any. <br>
%n Name of the file (its path from the top directory). <br>
%s Size of the file, in bytes. <br>
%t Time stamp of the last modification.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File Status <br>
The %c macro, giving a single character coding the file
status, can expand into one of the following. <br>
. The file is up to date (not newer than patchlevel.h). <br>
- The file is present in the manifest but is missing. <br>
&gt; The file has been modified since last patch (newer than
patchlevel.h). <br>
+ The file exists but is not listed in the manifest. <br>
o The file exists but is not listed in the manifest and is
older than patchlevel.h <br>
x The file is listed in the manifest and exists, but has
been excluded. Naturally, this will appear in the report
only if the x selector is given in the report format. <br>
? The file is listed in the manifest, does not exist, and
was excluded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
The command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">manilist -ct -p
&rsquo;ni:%n&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will list all the source files
from your distribution which are not listed in your
MANIFEST.new file. Note that this includes only
&quot;source&quot; files, that is to say files whose <br>
extension is listed in the inclusion list. If you do not
wish this restriction, replace the formatting string with
n:%n (only the excluded files will not appear).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To build an initial MANIFEST
file, use:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">manilist -n -p
&rsquo;Af:%n&rsquo; &gt; MANIFEST</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">from the top directory. You will
eventually want to fill in descriptions for each file listed
in the manifest.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
MANIFEST.new Default manifest file, listing files and giving
a small description for each of them.</p>
