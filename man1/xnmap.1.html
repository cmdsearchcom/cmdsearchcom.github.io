<p>ZENMAP(1) Zenmap Reference Guide ZENMAP(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
zenmap - Graphical Nmap frontend and results viewer</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
zenmap [options] [results file]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Zenmap is a multi-platform graphical Nmap frontend and
results viewer. Zenmap aims to make Nmap easy for beginners
to use while giving experienced Nmap users advanced
features. <br>
Frequently used scans can be saved as profiles to make them
easy to run repeatedly. A command creator allows interactive
creation of Nmap command lines. Scan results can be saved
<br>
and viewed later. Saved scan results can be compared with
one another to see how they differ. The results of recent
scans are stored in a searchable database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This man page only describes the
few Zenmap command-line options and some critical notes. A
much more detailed Zenmap User&rsquo;s Guide is available at
<br>
http://nmap.org/book/zenmap.html. Other documentation and
information is available from the Zenmap web page at
http://nmap.org/zenmap/.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS SUMMARY <br>
-f, --file results file <br>
Open the given results file for viewing. The results file
may be an Nmap XML output file (.xml, as produced by nmap
-oX) or a Umit scan results file (.usr). This option may
<br>
be given more than once.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Show a help message and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --nmap Nmap command line
<br>
Run the given Nmap command within the Zenmap interface.
After -n or --nmap, every remaining command line argument is
read as the command line to execute. This means that -n <br>
or --nmap must be given last, after any other options. Note
that the command line must include the nmap executable name:
zenmap -n nmap -sS target.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, --profile profile <br>
Start with the given profile selected. The profile name is
just a string: &quot;Regular scan&quot;. If combined with
-t, begin a scan with the given profile against the
specified <br>
target.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t, --target target <br>
Start with the given target. If combined with -p, begin a
scan with the given profile against the specified
target.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
Increase verbosity (of Zenmap, not Nmap). This option may be
given multiple times to get even more verbosity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any other arguments are taken to
be the names of results files to open.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
ZENMAP_DEVELOPMENT <br>
Set ZENMAP_DEVELOPMENT to disable automatic crash
reporting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Like their authors, Nmap and Zenmap aren&acirc;t perfect.
But you can help make them better by sending bug reports or
even writing patches. If Nmap or Zenmap doesn&acirc;t behave
the way you <br>
expect, first upgrade to the latest version available from
http://nmap.org. If the problem persists, do some research
to determine whether it has already been discovered and <br>
addressed. Try Googling the error message or browsing the
nmap-dev archives at http://seclists.org/. Read this full
manual page as well. If nothing comes of this, mail a bug
<br>
report to &lt;dev@nmap.org&gt;. Please include everything
you have learned about the problem, as well as what version
of Zenmap you are running and what operating system version
it is <br>
running on. Problem reports and Zenmap usage questions sent
to dev@nmap.org are far more likely to be answered than
those sent to Fyodor directly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Code patches to fix bugs are
even better than bug reports. Basic instructions for
creating patch files with your changes are available at
https://svn.nmap.org/nmap/HACKING. <br>
Patches may be sent to nmap-dev (recommended) or to Fyodor
directly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY <br>
Zenmap was originally derived from Umit, an Nmap GUI created
during the Google-sponsored Nmap Summer of Code in 2005 and
2006. The primary author of Umit was Adriano Monteiro <br>
Marques. When Umit was modified and integrated into Nmap in
2007, it was renamed Zenmap.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHORS <br>
Nmap <br>
Fyodor &lt;fyodor@nmap.org&gt; (http://insecure.org)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hundreds of people have made
valuable contributions to Nmap over the years. These are
detailed in the CHANGELOG file which is distributed with
Nmap and also available from <br>
http://nmap.org/changelog.html.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Umit <br>
Zenmap is derived from the Umit Nmap frontend, which was
started by Adriano Monteiro Marques as an Nmap/Google Summer
of Code project (&lt;py.adriano@gmail.com&gt;, <br>
http://www.umitproject.org).</p>
