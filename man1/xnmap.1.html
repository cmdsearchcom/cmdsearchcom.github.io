Zenmap is a multi-platform graphical Nmap frontend and results viewer. Zenmap
  aims to make Nmap easy for beginners to use while giving experienced Nmap
  users advanced features. Frequently used scans can be saved as profiles to
  make them easy to run repeatedly. A command creator allows interactive
  creation of Nmap command lines. Scan results can be saved and viewed later.
  Saved scan results can be compared with one another to see how they differ.
  The results of recent scans are stored in a searchable database.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This man page only describes the few Zenmap command-line options and some
  critical notes. A much more detailed Zenmap User's Guide is available at
  <b>http://nmap.org/book/zenmap.html</b>. Other documentation and information
  is available from the Zenmap web page at <b>http://nmap.org/zenmap/</b>.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS_SUMMARY"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS_SUMMARY">OPTIONS
  SUMMARY</a></h1>
<b>-f</b>, <b>--file </b><b></b><i>results file</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Open the given results file for viewing. The
  results file may be an Nmap XML output file (.xml, as produced by <b>nmap
  -oX</b>) or a Umit scan results file (.usr). This option may be given more
  than once.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Show a help message and exit.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-n</b>, <b>--nmap </b><b></b><i>Nmap command line</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Run the given Nmap command within the Zenmap
  interface. After <b>-n</b> or <b>--nmap</b>, every remaining command line
  argument is read as the command line to execute. This means that <b>-n</b> or
  <b>--nmap</b> must be given last, after any other options. Note that the
  command line must include the <b>nmap</b> executable name: <b>zenmap -n nmap
  -sS target</b>.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-p</b>, <b>--profile </b><b></b><i>profile</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Start with the given profile selected. The
  profile name is just a string: &quot;Regular scan&quot;. If combined with
  <b>-t</b>, begin a scan with the given profile against the specified
  target.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-t</b>, <b>--target </b><b></b><i>target</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Start with the given target. If combined with
  <b>-p</b>, begin a scan with the given profile against the specified
  target.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Increase verbosity (of Zenmap, not Nmap). This
  option may be given multiple times to get even more verbosity.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Any other arguments are taken to be the names of results files to open.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES"><a class="selflink" href="#ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES">ENVIRONMENT

<b>ZENMAP_DEVELOPMENT</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Set <b>ZENMAP_DEVELOPMENT</b> to disable
  automatic crash reporting.</div>

Like their authors, Nmap and Zenmap aren&#x2019;t perfect. But you can help make
  them better by sending bug reports or even writing patches. If Nmap or Zenmap
  doesn&#x2019;t behave the way you expect, first upgrade to the latest version
  available from <b>http://nmap.org</b>. If the problem persists, do some
  research to determine whether it has already been discovered and addressed.
  Try Googling the error message or browsing the nmap-dev archives at
  <b>http://seclists.org/</b>. Read this full manual page as well. If nothing
  comes of this, mail a bug report to &lt;dev@nmap.org&gt;. Please include
  everything you have learned about the problem, as well as what version of
  Zenmap you are running and what operating system version it is running on.
  Problem reports and Zenmap usage questions sent to dev@nmap.org are far more
  likely to be answered than those sent to Fyodor directly.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Code patches to fix bugs are even better than bug reports. Basic instructions
  for creating patch files with your changes are available at
  <b>https://svn.nmap.org/nmap/HACKING</b>. Patches may be sent to nmap-dev
  (recommended) or to Fyodor directly.

Zenmap was originally derived from Umit, an Nmap GUI created during the
  Google-sponsored Nmap Summer of Code in 2005 and 2006. The primary author of
  Umit was Adriano Monteiro Marques. When Umit was modified and integrated into
  Nmap in 2007, it was renamed Zenmap.

Hundreds of people have made valuable contributions to Nmap over the years.
  These are detailed in the CHANGELOG file which is distributed with Nmap and
  also available from <b>http://nmap.org/changelog.html</b>.
