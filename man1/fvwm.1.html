<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
Fvwm - F? Virtual Window Manager for X11</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
fvwm [-c config-command] [-d displayname] [-f config-file]
[-r] [-s [screen_num]] [-V] [-C visual-class | -I visual-id]
[-l colors [-L] [-A] [-S] [-P]] [-D] [-h] [-i client-id]
<br>
[-F state-file] [--debug-stack-ring] [-blackout]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Fvwm is a window manager for X11. It is designed to minimize
memory consumption, provide a 3D look to window frames, and
a virtual desktop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that there are several
window managers around that have &quot;fvwm&quot; in their
name. In the past, version 2.x of fvwm was commonly called
fvwm2 to distinguish it from the former <br>
version 1.x (fvwm or even fvwm1). Since version 1.x has been
replaced by version 2.x a long time ago we simply call
version 2.x and all versions to come, fvwm, throughout this
<br>
document, and the executable program is named fvwm. There is
an fvwm offspring called fvwm95, it is mostly a patched
version of fvwm-2.0.43. The main goal of fvwm95 was to <br>
supply a Windows 95 like look and feel. Since then, fvwm has
been greatly enhanced and practically all fvwm95 features
can be achieved by fvwm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fvwm provides both a large
virtual desktop and multiple disjoint desktops which can be
used separately or together. The virtual desktop allows you
to pretend that your video <br>
screen is really quite large, and you can scroll around
within the desktop. The multiple disjoint desktops allow you
to pretend that you really have several screens to work at,
<br>
but each screen is completely unrelated to the others.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fvwm provides keyboard
accelerators that allow you to perform most window manager
functions, including moving and resizing windows and
operating the menus, using keyboard <br>
shortcuts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fvwm has also overcome the
distinction between configuration commands and action
commands that most window managers make. Configuration
commands typically set fonts, colors, <br>
menu contents, and key and mouse function bindings, while
action commands do things like raise and lower windows. Fvwm
makes no such distinction and allows anything to be <br>
changed at any time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other noteworthy differences
between fvwm and other X11 window managers are the
introduction of the SloppyFocus and NeverFocus focus
methods. Focus policy can be separately <br>
specified for different window groups. Windows using
SloppyFocus acquire focus when the pointer moves into them
and retain focus until some other window acquires it. Such
<br>
windows do not lose focus when the pointer moves into the
root window. The NeverFocus policy is provided for use with
windows into which one never types (e.g. xclock, oclock,
<br>
xbiff, xeyes, tuxeyes) - for example, if a SloppyFocus
terminal window has focus, moving the pointer over a
NeverFocus decoration window does not deprive the terminal
of focus.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
These are the command line options that are recognized by
fvwm:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i | --clientid id <br>
This option is used when fvwm is started by a session
manager. Should not be used by a user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c | --cmd config-command <br>
Causes fvwm to use config-command instead of &rsquo;Read
config&rsquo; (or &rsquo;Read .fvwm2rc&rsquo;) as its
initialization command. (Note that up to 10 -f and -c
parameters can be given, and <br>
they are executed in the order specified.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any module started by command
line arguments is assumed to be a module that sends back
config commands. All command line modules have to quit
before fvwm proceeds on to the <br>
StartFunction and setting border decorations and styles.
There is a potential deadlock if you start a module other
than FvwmCpp/FvwmM4/FvwmPerl but there is a timeout so <br>
fvwm eventually gets going.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As an example, starting the
pager this way hangs fvwm until the timeout, but the
following should work well:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fvwm -c &quot;AddToFunc
StartFunction I Module FvwmPager&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d | --display displayname <br>
Manage the display called displayname instead of the name
obtained from the environment variable $DISPLAY.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D | --debug <br>
Puts X transactions in synchronous mode, which dramatically
slows things down, but guarantees that fvwm&rsquo;s internal
error messages are correct. Also causes fvwm to output <br>
debug messages while running.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f config-file <br>
Causes fvwm to read config-file instead of ~/.fvwm/config as
its initialization file. This is equivalent to -c
&rsquo;Read config-file&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h | --help <br>
A short usage description is printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r | --replace <br>
Try to take over from a previously running wm. This does not
work unless the other wm is ICCCM2 2.0 compliant.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F | --restore state-file <br>
This option is used when fvwm is started by a session
manager. Should not be used by a user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s | --single-screen
[screen_num] <br>
On a multi-screen display, run fvwm only on the screen named
in the $DISPLAY environment variable or provided through the
-d option. The optional argument screen_num should <br>
be positive or null and override the screen number.
Normally, fvwm attempts to start up on all screens of a
multi-screen display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V | --version <br>
Prints the version of fvwm to stderr. Also prints an
information about the compiled in support for readline,
rplay, stroke, xpm, png, svg, GNOME hints, EWMH hints,
session <br>
management, bidirectional text, multibyte characters,
xinerama and Xft aa font rendering.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C | --visual visual-class <br>
Causes fvwm to use visual-class for the window borders and
menus. visual-class can be &quot;StaticGray&quot;,
&quot;GrayScale&quot;, &quot;StaticColor&quot;,
&quot;PseudoColor&quot;, &quot;TrueColor&quot; or
&quot;DirectColor&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I | --visualid id <br>
Causes fvwm to use id as the visual id for the window
borders and menus. id can be specified as N for decimal or
0xN for hexadecimal. See man page of xdpyinfo for a list of
<br>
supported visuals.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l | --color-limit limit <br>
Specifies a limit on the colors used in image, gradient and
possibly simple colors used by fvwm. In fact, fvwm (and all
the modules) uses a palette with at most limit <br>
colors. This option is only useful with screens that display
256 colors (or less) with a dynamic visual (PseudoColor,
GrayScale or DirectColor). The default depends on your <br>
X server and how you run fvwm. In most case this default is
reasonable. The -l option should be used only if you
encounter problems with colors. By default, fvwm tries to
<br>
detect large pre-allocated palettes. If such a palette is
detected fvwm uses it and a priori the -l must not be used.
Moreover, in this case the -A and -S options are <br>
forced. Note that XFree-4.2 pre-allocates 244 colors (if you
use a driver with Render support) leaving only a few free
colors. This may lead to some color problems (and <br>
nothing can be done). XFree-4.3 or better pre-allocate only
85 colors. If no pre-allocated palette is auto detected the
defaults are as follow:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Display depth 8 (256 colors)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PseudoColor: 68 (4x4x4 color
cube + 4 grey) <br>
GrayScale: 64 regular grey <br>
DirectColor: 32 (3x3x3 color cube + 5 grey)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Display depth 4 (16 colors)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PseudoColor: 10 (2x2x2 color
cube + 2 grey) <br>
GrayScale: 8 regular grey <br>
DirectColor: 10 (2x2x2 color cube + 2 grey)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These defaults may change before
version 2.6. Note that if you use a private color map (i.e.,
fvwm is started with the -C or the -I options), then other
defaults are used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Now what to do if you encounter
problems with colors? The first thing to do is to check if
you really cannot run your X server with depth 15, 16 or
better. Check your X <br>
server documentation. Note that some hardware can support
two different depths on the same screen (typically depth 8
and depth 24). If depth 8 is the default, you can force <br>
fvwm to use the best depth by using the -C option with
TrueColor as argument. So now we assume that you are forced
to run in depth 8 with a dynamic visual because your <br>
hardware/driver cannot do better or because you need to use
an application which needs to run under this mode (e.g.,
because this application needs read-write colors). What <br>
it should be understand is that you have only 256 colors and
that all the applications which use the default color map
must share these colors. The main problem is that <br>
there are applications which use a lot or even all the
colors. If you use such application you may have no more
free colors and some applications (which used only a few
<br>
colors) may fail to start or are unusable. There are three
things that can be done (and fvwm does not really play a
particular role, all applications are concerned). The <br>
first is to run the applications which waste your (default)
color map with a private color map. For example, run
netscape with the -install option, run KDE or QT <br>
applications with the --cmap option, use the -C option for
fvwm. The disadvantage of this method is that it is visually
disturbing (see the ColormapFocus command for a <br>
better control of the color maps switching). The second
method is to limit the number of colors that the
applications use. Again, some applications have options to
specify <br>
a given color limit. With fvwm you may try various values,
61 (a special &quot;visual&quot; palette), 56 (a 4x4x3 color
cube plus 6 grey), 29 (a 3x3x3 color cube plus 2 grey), 10
or <br>
9. Also, you may use the -L option. However, limiting the
number of colors is not the definitive solution. The
definitive solution is to try cause applications which use a
<br>
lot of colors use the same colors. This is a difficult task
as there are no formal standards for this goal. However,
some toolkits as QT and GTK use color cubes as <br>
palettes. So, the idea is to configure your
applications/toolkits to all use the same color cube.
Moreover, you can use the colors in this color cube in your
X resources <br>
configuration files and/or as arguments to colors options.
Fvwm can use any color cube of the form RxGxB with 2 &lt;= R
&lt;= 6, R = G, R-1 =&lt; B &lt;= R and B &gt;= 2. To get an
RxGxB <br>
color cube give an argument to -l an integer c &gt;= R*G*B
and &lt; (R+1)*(G+1)*B if B=R and &lt; R*G*(B+1) if B &lt; R
(and different from 61). If c &gt; R*G*B, then some grey may
be <br>
added to the color cube. You can use the PrintInfo Colors
[1] command to get information on your fvwm colors setting.
In particular, this command prints the palette used by <br>
fvwm in rgb format (the last integer gives the number of
times fvwm has allocated the colors).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L | --strict-color-limit <br>
If the screen displays 256 colors (or less) and has a
dynamic visual, causes fvwm to use its palette for all the
colors. By default, the palette is used only for images and
<br>
gradients.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P | --visual-palette <br>
If the screen displays 256 colors (or less) and has a
dynamic visual, this option causes fvwm to use a palette
designed for limiting the &quot;visual&quot; color distance
between the <br>
points of the palette. Moreover, for better color sharing,
if possible colors with a name in the X rgb data base are
used for defining the colors (with the hope that <br>
applications and images prefer to use named colors). If the
-l option is not used this palette has 61 colors. This
palette is also automatically selected if 61 or 9 is used
<br>
as argument to the -l option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A | --allocate-palette <br>
If the screen displays 256 colors (or less) and has a
dynamic visual this option causes fvwm to allocate all the
colors of its palette at start up for reserving these colors
<br>
for future use. This option forces the -static-palette
option. By default, fvwm allocates (reserves) a color in its
palette only if it needs this color.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S | --static-palette <br>
If the screen displays 256 colors (or less) and has a
dynamic visual this option causes fvwm to never free the
colors in its palette. By default, when fvwm does not need a
<br>
color any more it frees this color so that a new color can
be used. This option may speed up image loading and save a
few bits of memory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-blackout <br>
This option is provided for backward compatibility only.
Blacking out the screen during startup is not necessary (and
doesn&rsquo;t work) anymore. This option will be removed in
<br>
the future.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--debug-stack-ring <br>
Enables stack ring debugging. This option is only intended
for internal debugging and should only be used by
developers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ANATOMY OF A WINDOW <br>
Fvwm puts a decorative border around most windows. This
border consists of a bar on each side and a small L-shaped
section on each corner. There is an additional top bar
called <br>
the title-bar which is used to display the name of the
window. In addition, there are up to 10 title-bar buttons.
The top, side, and bottom bars are collectively known as the
<br>
side-bars. The corner pieces are called the frame.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With the built-in minimal
configuration, dragging mouse button 1 in the frame or
side-bars begins a resize operation on the window. Dragging
mouse button 2 in the frame or <br>
side-bars begins a move operation. There are raise/lower
operations bound to a single clicking on borders. Similarly
for the window title.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Up to ten title-bar buttons may
exist. Their use is completely user definable. One popular
configuration uses one button on the left that is used to
bring up a list of window <br>
options and two buttons on the right used to iconify and
maximize the window. Another popular configuration adds a
close button to the right. The number of title-bar buttons
<br>
used depends on which ones have mouse actions bound to them.
See the Mouse command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THE VIRTUAL DESKTOP <br>
Fvwm provides multiple virtual desktops for users who wish
to use them. The screen is a viewport onto a desktop which
may be larger than the screen. Several distinct desktops
<br>
can be accessed (concept: one desktop for each project, or
one desktop for each application, when view applications are
distinct). Since each desktop can be larger than the <br>
physical screen, divided into m by n pages which are each
the size of the physical screen, windows which are larger
than the screen or large groups of related windows can
easily <br>
be viewed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The (m by n) size (i.e. number
of pages) of the virtual desktops can be changed any time,
by using the DesktopSize command. All virtual desktops must
be (are) the same size. <br>
The total number of distinct desktops does not need to be
specified, but is limited to approximately 4 billion total.
All windows on a range of desktops can be viewed in the <br>
FvwmPager, a miniature view of the desktops. The pager is an
accessory program, called a module, which is not essential
for the window manager to operate. Windows may also be <br>
listed, along with their geometries, in a window list,
accessible as a pop-up menu, or as a separate window, called
the FvwmWinList (another module).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fvwm keeps the windows on the
desktop in a layered stacking order; a window in a lower
layer never obscures a window in a higher layer. The layer
of a window can be changed by <br>
using the Layer command. The concept of layers is a
generalization of the StaysOnTop flag of older fvwm
versions. The StaysOnTop and StaysPut Style options are now
implemented <br>
by putting the windows in suitable layers and the previously
missing StaysOnBottom Style option has been added.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sticky windows are windows which
transcend the virtual desktop by &quot;Sticking to the
screen&rsquo;s glass&quot;. They always stay put on the
screen. This is convenient for things like <br>
clocks and xbiffs, so you only need to run one such gadget
and it always stays with you. Icons can also be made to
stick to the glass, if desired.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Window geometries are specified
relative to the current viewport. That is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xterm -geometry +0+0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">creates a window in the upper
left hand corner of the visible portion of the screen. It is
permissible to specify geometries which place windows on the
virtual desktop, but off <br>
the screen. For example, if the visible screen is 1000 by
1000 pixels, and the desktop size is 3x3, and the current
viewport is at the upper left hand corner of the desktop,
<br>
invoking:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xterm -geometry +1000+1000</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">places a window just off of the
lower right hand corner of the screen. It can be found by
moving the mouse to the lower right hand corner of the
screen and waiting for it to <br>
scroll into view. A geometry specified as something
like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xterm -geometry -5-5</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">places the window&rsquo;s lower
right hand corner 5 pixels from the lower right corner of
the visible portion of the screen. Not all applications
support window geometries with <br>
negative offsets. Some applications place the window&rsquo;s
upper right hand corner 5 pixels above and to the left of
the upper left hand corner of the screen; others may do just
<br>
plain bizarre things.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are several ways to cause
a window to map onto a desktop or page other than the
currently active one. The geometry technique mentioned above
(specifying x,y coordinates <br>
larger than the physical screen size), however, suffers from
the limitation of being interpreted relative to the current
viewport: the window may not consistently appear on a <br>
specific page, unless you always invoke the application from
the same page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A better way to place windows on
a different page, screen or desk from the currently mapped
viewport is to use the StartsOnPage or StartsOnScreen style
specification (the <br>
successors to the older StartsOnDesk style) in your config
file. The placement is consistent: it does not depend on
your current location on the virtual desktop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some applications that
understand standard Xt command line arguments and X
resources, like xterm and xfontsel, allow the user to
specify the start-up desk or page on the command <br>
line:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xterm -xrm
&quot;*Desk:1&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">starts an xterm on desk number
1;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xterm -xrm &quot;*Page:3 2
1&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">starts an xterm two pages to the
right and one down from the upper left hand page of desk
number 3. Not all applications understand the use of these
options, however. You could <br>
achieve the same results with the following lines in your
.Xdefaults file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">XTerm*Desk: 1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">XTerm*Page: 3 2 1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USE ON MULTI-SCREEN DISPLAYS
<br>
If the -s command line argument is not given, fvwm
automatically starts up on every screen on the specified
display. After fvwm starts each screen is treated
independently. <br>
Restarts of fvwm need to be performed separately on each
screen. The use of</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EdgeScroll 0 0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">is strongly recommended for
multi-screen displays. You may need to quit on each screen
to quit from the X session completely. This is not to be
confused with Xinerama support.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">XINERAMA SUPPORT <br>
Fvwm supports the Xinerama extension of newer X servers
which is similar to multi head support (multiple screens)
but allows one to move windows between screens. If Xinerama
<br>
support has been compiled into fvwm, it is used whenever
fvwm runs on an X server that supports and uses multiple
screens via Xinerama. Without this option, the whole desktop
is <br>
treated as one big screen. For example, menus might pop up
right between two screens. The EdgeResistance option of the
Style command command allows for specifying an explicit <br>
resistance value for moving windows over the screen edge
between two Xinerama screens. Xinerama support can be
enabled or disabled on the fly or from the configuration
file with <br>
the Xinerama command. Many modules and commands work nicely
with Xinerama displays.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Whenever a geometry in the usual
X format can be supplied, fvwm&rsquo;s Xinerama extension
allows for specifying a screen in addition to the geometry
(or even the screen alone). To do <br>
this, a &rsquo;@&rsquo; is added to the end of the geometry
string followed by either the screen number or a letter. A
number is taken as the number of the Xinerama screen to be
used (as <br>
configured in the X server). The letter can be one of
&rsquo;g&rsquo; for the global screen (the rectangle that
encloses all Xinerama screens), &rsquo;p&rsquo; for the
primary screen (see below), &rsquo;c&rsquo; <br>
for the current screen (the one that currently contains the
pointer). If the X server does not support Xinerama or only
one screen is used, the screen bit is ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Style * IconBox 64x300-0-0@p</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Xinerama support can be
configured to use a primary screen. Fvwm can be configured
to place new windows and icons on this screen. The primary
screen is screen 0 by default but <br>
can be changed with the XineramaPrimaryScreen command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Xinerama support was designed to
work out of the box with the same configuration file that
would work on a single screen. It may not perform very well
if the involved screens <br>
use different screen resolutions. In this situation, windows
may get stuck in the portion of the whole desktop that
belongs to neither screen. When this happens, the windows or
<br>
icons can be retrieved with the command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All MoveToScreen</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">that can be entered in an
FvwmConsole window or with FvwmCommand.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For multi-screen implementations
other than Xinerama, such as Single Logical Screen, it is
possible to simulate a Xinerama configuration if the total
screen seen by fvwm is made <br>
up of equal sized monitors in a rectangular grid. The
commands XineramaSls, XineramaSlsSize and XineramaSlsScreens
are used to configure this feature.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INITIALIZATION <br>
During initialization, fvwm searches for a configuration
file which describes key and button bindings, and many other
things. The format of these files is described later. Fvwm
<br>
first searches for configuration files using the command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Read config</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This looks for file config in
$FVWM_USERDIR and $FVWM_DATADIR directories, as described in
Read. If this fails more files are queried for backward
compatibility. Here is the <br>
complete list of all file locations queried in the default
installation (only the first found file is used):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$HOME/.fvwm/config <br>
/usr/local/share/fvwm/config</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$HOME/.fvwm/.fvwm2rc <br>
$HOME/.fvwm2rc <br>
/usr/local/share/fvwm/.fvwm2rc <br>
/usr/local/share/fvwm/system.fvwm2rc <br>
/etc/system.fvwm2rc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please note, the last 5
locations are not guaranteed to be supported in the
future.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a configuration file is not
found, the left mouse button, or Help or F1 keys on the root
window bring up menus and forms that can create a starting
configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fvwm sets two environment
variables which are inherited by its children. These are
$DISPLAY which describes the display on which fvwm is
running. $DISPLAY may be unix:0.0 or <br>
:0.0, which doesn&rsquo;t work too well when passed through
ssh to another machine, so $HOSTDISPLAY is set to a
network-ready description of the display. $HOSTDISPLAY
always uses the <br>
TCP/IP transport protocol (even for a local connection) so
$DISPLAY should be used for local connections, as it may use
Unix-domain sockets, which are faster.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to start some
applications or modules with fvwm, you can simply put</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Exec app</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Module FvwmXxx</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">into your config, but it is not
recommended; do this only if you know what you are doing. It
is usually important to start applications or modules after
the entire config is <br>
read, because it contains styles or module configurations
which can affect window appearance and functionality.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The standard way to start
applications or modules on fvwm&rsquo;s start up is to add
them to an initialization function (usually StartFunction or
InitFunction). This way they are only <br>
started after fvwm finishes to read and execute config
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fvwm has three special functions
for initialization: StartFunction, which is executed on
startups and restarts; InitFunction and RestartFunction,
which are executed during <br>
initialization and restarts (respectively) just after
StartFunction. These functions may be customized in a
user&rsquo;s config file using the AddToFunc command
(described later) to <br>
start up modules, xterms, or whatever you&rsquo;d like to
have started by fvwm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fvwm has also a special exit
function: ExitFunction, executed when exiting or restarting
before actually quitting. It could be used to explicitly
kill modules, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If fvwm is run under a session
manager, functions SessionInitFunction and
SessionRestartFunction are executed instead of InitFunction
and RestartFunction. This helps to define <br>
the user&rsquo;s config file to be good for both running
under a session manager and without it. Generally it is a
bad idea to start xterms or other applications in
&quot;Session*&quot; <br>
functions. Also someone can decide to start different
modules while running under a session manager or not. For
the similar purposes SessionExitFunction is used instead of
<br>
ExitFunction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You do not need to define all
special functions if some are empty. Also note, all these

and ExitFunction, like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DestroyFunc StartFunction <br>

+ I Test (ToRestart) Beep</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMPILATION OPTIONS <br>
Fvwm has a number of compile-time options. If you have
trouble using a certain command or feature, check to see if
support for it was included at compile time. Optional <br>
features are described in the config.h file that is
generated during compilation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ICONS AND IMAGES <br>
Fvwm can load .xbm, .xpm, .png and .svg images. XBM images
are monochrome. Fvwm can always display XBM files. XPM and
PNG formats are color images. SVG is a vector graphics <br>
image format. Compile-time options determine whether fvwm
can display XPM, PNG or SVG icons and images. See the
INSTALL.fvwm file for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The related SHAPE compile-time
option can make fvwm display spiffy shaped icons.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SVG rendering options <br>
SVG images are generated from (XML) text files. A really
simple SVG file might look something like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;svg width=&quot;120&quot;
height=&quot;80&quot;&gt; <br>
&lt;rect fill=&quot;red&quot; width=&quot;40&quot;
height=&quot;40&quot; x=&quot;0&quot; y=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;
<br>
&lt;rect fill=&quot;lime&quot; width=&quot;40&quot;
height=&quot;40&quot; x=&quot;40&quot; y=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;
<br>
&lt;rect fill=&quot;blue&quot; width=&quot;40&quot;
height=&quot;40&quot; x=&quot;80&quot; y=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;
<br>
&lt;rect fill=&quot;cyan&quot; width=&quot;40&quot;
height=&quot;40&quot; x=&quot;0&quot; y=&quot;40&quot; /&gt;
<br>
&lt;rect fill=&quot;magenta&quot; width=&quot;40&quot;
height=&quot;40&quot; x=&quot;40&quot; y=&quot;40&quot;
/&gt; <br>
&lt;rect fill=&quot;yellow&quot; width=&quot;40&quot;
height=&quot;40&quot; x=&quot;80&quot; y=&quot;40&quot;
/&gt; <br>
&lt;/svg&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, SVG images are
rendered as the image creator intended them to. But since
SVG is a vector graphics format, the images can be rendered
at any chosen size and rotation, <br>
e.g. making it possible to use the same icon file rendered
at diffrent sizes for the Icon and MiniIcon styles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The rendering options are
specified as a string appended to the SVG filename as
follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">image.svg:[!] [(1) size] [(2)
position] [(3) rotation] [(4) scale] ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(1) [-]width{x}[-]height <br>
(2) {- | +}xpos{- | +}ypos <br>
(3) @[-]angle <br>
(4) {* | /}[-]factor[x | y]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The option string always starts
with a colon (&rsquo;:&rsquo;) to separate it from the
filename. An empty option string can skip this colon, but it
might still be a good idea to include it <br>
to prevent ambiguity if the filename contains any colon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">filename_without_colon.svg <br>
filename:with:colon.svg:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An exclamation point
(&rsquo;!&rsquo;) transposes the entire final image
(including the rendering area), i.e. all the horizontal and
all the vertical coordinates are swapped with each
other.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">image.svg:!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">width and height specifies the
dimensions of the rendering area in pixels, i.e. the
dimensions of the resulting image. The actual image is
fitted to fill the entire rendering <br>
area.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">image.svg:60x60</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use a width or height value of 0
to keep the aspect ratio.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">image.svg:0x60 <br>
image.svg:60x0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A &rsquo;-&rsquo; before width
mirrors the rendering area horizontally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">image.svg:-0x0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A &rsquo;-&rsquo; before height
mirrors the rendering area vertically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">image.svg:0x-0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xpos and ypos specifies a
translation of the image in pixels. A positive xpos value
moves the image to the right. A positive ypos value moves it
down. Moving it partially <br>
outside of the rendering area results in a cropped
image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">image.svg:-30-0 <br>
image.svg:-0+10 <br>
image.svg:-30+10</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">angle specifies a rotation
around the actual image center in degrees. This might result
in a cropped image. A positive value rotates the image
clockwise. Floating point values <br>
are recognized.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">image.svg:@180 <br>
image.svg:@-90 <br>
image.svg:@30 <br>
image.svg:@57.3</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">factor specifes a scaling of the
actual image (not the rendering area). Scaling it up results
in a cropped image. Floting point values are recognized.
Division by zero is <br>
ignored. If factor is directly followed by a &rsquo;x&rsquo;
or a &rsquo;y&rsquo;, the scaling is horizontal or vertical
respectively. Otherwise the scaling is uniform.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">image.svg:*2 <br>
image.svg:/2 <br>
image.svg:/3x <br>
image.svg:/2y</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Scaling down a translated or
rotated image can prevent cropping.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">image.svg:@30*0.6</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Repeated usage of translation,
rotation, and scaling is allowed. Translation and rotation
are additive. Scaling is multiplicative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">image.svg:*2/3 <br>
image.svg:/3x/2y</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When combining affine
transformations, the scaling is always done first, then the
rotation, and finally the translation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">image.svg:-30+10@30/3x/2y</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use a negative scale factor to
mirror the actual image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">image.svg:-30+10@30/-3x/2y</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mirroring of the rendering area
is done after any scaling, rotation or translation of the
image.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">image.svg:-0x0-30+10@30/3x/2y</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Transposing is done last of all,
after everything else.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">image.svg:!-0x0-30+10@30/3x/2y</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MODULES <br>
A module is a separate program which runs as a separate Unix
process but transmits commands to fvwm to execute. Users can
write their own modules to do any weird or bizarre <br>
manipulations without bloating or affecting the integrity of
fvwm itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Modules must be spawned by fvwm
so that it can set up two pipes for fvwm and the module to
communicate with. The pipes are already open for the module
when it starts and the <br>
file descriptors for the pipes are provided as command line
arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Modules can be spawned by fvwm
at any time during the X session by use of the Module
command. Modules can exist for the duration of the X
session, or can perform a single task <br>
and exit. If the module is still active when fvwm is told to
quit, then fvwm closes the communication pipes and waits to
receive a SIGCHLD from the module, indicating that it <br>
has detected the pipe closure and has exited. If modules
fail to detect the pipe closure fvwm exits after
approximately 30 seconds anyway. The number of
simultaneously <br>
executing modules is limited by the operating system&rsquo;s
maximum number of simultaneously open files, usually between
60 and 256.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Modules simply transmit commands
to the fvwm command engine. Commands are formatted just as
in the case of a mouse binding in the config setup file.
Certain auxiliary <br>
information is also transmitted, as in the sample module
FvwmButtons.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please refer to the Module
Commands section for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ICCCM COMPLIANCE <br>
Fvwm attempts to be ICCCM 2.0 compliant. Check
http://tronche.com/gui/x/icccm/ for more info. In addition,
ICCCM states that it should be possible for applications to
receive <br>
any keystroke, which is not consistent with the keyboard
shortcut approach used in fvwm and most other window
managers. In particular you cannot have the same keyboard
shortcuts <br>
working with your fvwm and another fvwm running within Xnest
(a nested X server running in a window). The same problem
exists with mouse bindings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ICCCM states that windows
possessing the property</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WM_HINTS(WM_HINTS): <br>
Client accepts input or input focus: False</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">should not be given the keyboard
input focus by the window manager. These windows can take
the input focus by themselves, however. A number of
applications set this property, <br>
and yet expect the window manager to give them the keyboard
focus anyway, so fvwm provides a window style, Lenience,
which allows fvwm to overlook this ICCCM rule. Even with
<br>
this window style it is not guaranteed that the application
accepts focus.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The differences between ICCCM
1.1 and 2.0 include the ability to take over from a running
ICCCM 2.0 compliant window manager; thus</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fvwm; vi ~/.fvwm/config; fvwm
-replace</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">resembles the Restart command.
It is not exactly the same, since killing the previously
running wm may terminate your X session, if the wm was
started as the last client in your <br>
.Xclients or .Xsession file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Further additions are support
for client-side colormap installation (see the ICCCM for
details) and the urgency hint. Clients can set this hint in
the WM_HINTS property of their <br>
window and expect the window manager to attract the
user&rsquo;s attention to the window. Fvwm has two
re-definable functions for this purpose,
&quot;UrgencyFunc&quot; and &quot;UrgencyDoneFunc&quot;,
<br>
which are executed when the flag is set/cleared. Their
default definitions are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AddToFunc UrgencyFunc <br>
+ I Iconify off <br>
+ I FlipFocus <br>
+ I Raise <br>
+ I WarpToWindow !raise 5p 5p <br>
AddToFunc UrgencyDoneFunc <br>
+ I Nop</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GNOME COMPLIANCE <br>
Fvwm attempts to be GNOME (version 1) compliant. Check
http://www.gnome.org for what that may mean. To disable
GNOME hints for some or all windows, the GNOMEIgnoreHints
style <br>
can be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTENDED WINDOW MANAGER HINTS
<br>
Fvwm attempts to respect the extended window manager hints
(ewmh or EWMH for short) specification:
http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Standards_2fwm_2dspec and
some extensions of <br>
this specification. This allows fvwm to work with KDE
version &gt;= 2, GNOME version 2 and other applications
which respect this specification (any application based on
GTK+ <br>
version 2). Applications which respect this specification
are called ewmh compliant applications.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This support is configurable
with styles and commands. These styles and commands have
EWMH as the prefix (so you can find them easily in this man
page).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is a new Context
&rsquo;D&rsquo; for the Key, PointerKey, Mouse and Stroke
commands. This context is for desktop applications (such as
kdesktop and Nautilus desktop).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a compliant taskbar asks
fvwm to activate a window (typically when you click on a
button which represents a window in such a taskbar), then
fvwm calls the complex function <br>
EWMHActivateWindowFunc which by default is Iconify Off,
Focus and Raise. You can redefine this function. For
example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DestroyFunc
EWMHActivateWindowFunc <br>
AddToFunc EWMHActivateWindowFunc I Iconify Off <br>
+ I Focus <br>
+ I Raise <br>
+ I WarpToWindow 50 50</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">additionally warps the pointer
to the center of the window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The EWMH specification
introduces the notion of Working Area. Without ewmh support
the Working Area is the full visible screen (or all your
screens if you have a multi head <br>
setup and you use Xinerama). However, compliant applications
(such as a panel) can ask to reserve space at the edge of
the screen. If this is the case, the Working Area is your
<br>
full visible screen minus these reserved spaces. If a panel
can be hidden by clicking on a button the Working Area does
not change (as you can unhide the panel at any time), but
<br>
the Dynamic Working Area is updated: the space reserved by
the panel is removed (and added again if you pop up the
panel). The Dynamic Working Area may be used when fvwm
places <br>
or maximizes a window. To know if an application reserves
space you can type &quot;xprop | grep _NET_WM_STRUT&quot; in
a terminal and select the application. If four numbers
appear then <br>
these numbers define the reserved space as explained in the
EwmhBaseStruts command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MWM COMPATIBILITY <br>
Fvwm provides options to emulate Motif Window Manager (Mwm)
as well as possible. Please refer to the Emulate command as
well as to the Mwm specific options of the Style and <br>
MenuStyle commands for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPEN LOOK AND XVIEW
COMPATIBILITY <br>
Fvwm supports all the Open Look decoration hints (except
pushpins). Should you use any such application, please add
the following line to your config:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Style * OLDecor</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most (perhaps all) Open Look
applications have a strange notion of keyboard focus
handling. Although a lot of work went into fvwm to work well
with these, you may still <br>
encounter problems. It is recommended to use the NeverFocus
focus policy and the Lenience style for all such
applications (the windows still get the focus):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Style &lt;application name&gt;
NeverFocus, Lenience</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">But in case you can not live
with that focus policy, you can try using one of the other
focus policies in combination with the Lenience style:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Style &lt;application name&gt;
MouseFocus, Lenience <br>
Style &lt;application name&gt; SloppyFocus, Lenience <br>
Style &lt;application name&gt; ClickToFocus, Lenience</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">M4 PREPROCESSING <br>
M4 pre-processing is handled by a module in fvwm. To get
more details, try man FvwmM4. In short, if you want fvwm to
parse your files with m4, then replace the command Read <br>
with FvwmM4 in your ~/.fvwm/config file (if it appears at
all), and start fvwm with the command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fvwm -cmd &quot;FvwmM4
config&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CPP PREPROCESSING <br>
Cpp is the C-language pre-processor. fvwm offers cpp
processing which mirrors the m4 pre-processing. To find out
about it, re-read the M4 section, but replace &quot;m4&quot;
with &quot;cpp&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION <br>
Configuration Files <br>
The configuration file is used to describe mouse and button
bindings, colors, the virtual display size, and related
items. The initialization configuration file is typically
<br>
called config (or .fvwm2rc). By using the Read command, it
is easy to read in new configuration files as you go.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Lines beginning with
&rsquo;#&rsquo; are ignored by fvwm. Lines starting with
&rsquo;*&rsquo; are expected to contain module configuration
commands (rather than configuration commands for fvwm
itself). <br>
Like in shell scripts embedded newlines in a configuration
file line can be quoted by preceding them with a backslash.
All lines linked in this fashion are treated as a single
<br>
line. The newline itself is ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fvwm makes no distinction
between configuration commands and action commands, so
anything mentioned in the fvwm commands section can be
placed on a line by itself for fvwm to <br>
execute as it reads the configuration file, or it can be
placed as an executable command in a menu or bound to a
mouse button or a keyboard key. It is left as an exercise
for <br>
the user to decide which function make sense for
initialization and which ones make sense for run-time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Supplied Configuration <br>
A sample configuration file, is supplied with the fvwm
distribution. It is well commented and can be used as a
source of examples for fvwm configuration. It may be copied
from <br>
/usr/local/share/fvwm/config file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alternatively, the built-in menu
(accessible when no configuration file is found) has options
to create an initial config file for the user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FONTS <br>
Font names and font loading <br>
The fonts used for the text of a window title, icon titles,
menus and geometry window can be specified by using the Font
and IconFont Style, the Font MenuStyle and the <br>
DefaultFont commands. Also, all the Modules which use text
have configuration command(s) to specify font(s). All these
styles and commands take a font name as an argument. <br>
This section explains what is a font name for fvwm and which
fonts fvwm loads.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">First, you can use what we can
call a usual font name, for example,</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-adobe-courier-bold-r-normal--10-100-75-75-m-60-ISO8859-1
<br>
-adobe-courier-bold-r-normal--10-* <br>
-*-fixed-medium-o-normal--14-*-ISO8859-15</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">That is, you can use an X
Logical Font Description (XLFD for short). Then the
&quot;first&quot; font which matches the description is
loaded and used. This &quot;first&quot; font depends of your
<br>
font path and also of your locale. Fonts which match the
locale charset are loaded in priority order. For example
with</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-adobe-courier-bold-r-normal--10-*</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if the locale charset is
ISO8859-1, then fvwm tries to load a font which matches</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-adobe-courier-bold-r-normal--10-*-ISO8859-1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">with the locale charset
ISO8859-15 fvwm tries to load</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-adobe-courier-bold-r-normal--10-*-ISO8859-15.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A font name can be given as an
extended XLFD. This is a comma separated list of (simple)
XLFD font names, for example:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-adobe-courier-bold-r-normal--14-*,-*-courier-medium-r-normal--14-*</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each simple font name is tried
until a matching font with the locale charset is found and
if this fails each simple font name is tried without
constraint on the charset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">More details on the XLFD can be
found in the X manual page, the X Logical Font Description
Conventions document (called xlfd) and the XLoadFont and
XCreateFontSet manual pages. <br>
Some useful font utilities are: xlsfonts, xfontsel, xfd and
xset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you have Xft support you can
specify an Xft font name (description) of a true type (or
Type1) font prefixed by &quot;xft:&quot;, for example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;xft:Luxi Mono&quot; <br>
&quot;xft:Luxi
Mono:Medium:Roman:size=14:encoding=iso8859-1&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;first&quot; font which
matches the description is loaded. This first font depends
on the XftConfig configuration file with Xft1 and on the
/etc/fonts/fonts.conf file with Xft2. <br>
One may read the Xft manual page and the fontconfig man page
with Xft2. The first string which follows &quot;xft:&quot;
is always considered as the family. With the second example
Luxi <br>
Mono is the Family (Other XFree TTF families: &quot;Luxi
Serif&quot;, &quot;Luxi Sans&quot;), Medium is the Weight
(other possible weights: Light, DemiBold, Bold, Black),
Roman is the slant or the <br>
style (other possibilities: Regular, Oblique, Italic) size
specifies the point size (for a pixel size use pixelsize=),
encoding allows for enforce a charset (iso8859-1 or <br>
iso10646-1 only; if no encoding is given the locale charset
is assumed). An important parameter is
&quot;minspace=bool&quot; where bool is True or False. If
bool is False (the default?) <br>
Xft gives a greater font height to fvwm than if bool is
True. This may modify text placement, icon and window title
height, line spacing in menus and FvwmIdent, button height
in <br>
some fvwm modules ...etc. With a LCD monitor you may try to
add &quot;rgba=mode&quot; where mode is either rgb, bgr,
vrgb or vbgr to enable subpixel rendering. The best mode
depends on <br>
the way your LCD cells are arranged. You can pass other
specifications in between &quot;:&quot;, as
&quot;foundry=foundry_name&quot;, &quot;spacing=type&quot;
where type can be monospace, proportional or <br>
charcell, &quot;charwidth=integer&quot;,
&quot;charheight=integer&quot; or &quot;antialias=bool&quot;
where bool is True or False. It seems that these parameters
are not always taken in account.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To determine which Xft fonts are
really loaded you can export XFT_DEBUG=1 before starting
fvwm and take a look to the error log. With Xft2 you may use
fc-list to list the <br>
available fonts. Anyway, Xft support is experimental (from
the X and the fvwm point of view) and the quality of the
rendering depends on number of parameters (the XFree and the
<br>
freetype versions and your video card(s)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After an Xft font name you can
add after a &quot;;&quot; an XLFD font name (simple or
extended) as:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">xft:Verdana:pixelsize=14;-adobe-courier-bold-r-normal--14-*</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">then, if either loading the Xft
font fails or fvwm has no Xft support, fvwm loads the font
&quot;-adobe-courier-bold-r-normal--14-*&quot;. This allows
for writing portable configuration <br>
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Font and string encoding <br>
Once a font is loaded, fvwm finds its encoding (or charset)
using its name (the last two fields of the name). fvwm
assumes that the strings which are displayed with this font
<br>
use this encoding (an exception is that if an iso10646-1
font is loaded, then UTF-8 is assumed for string encoding).
In a normal situation, (i) a font is loaded by giving a font
<br>
name without specifying the encoding, (ii) the encoding of
the loaded font is the locale encoding, and then (iii) the
strings in the fvwm configuration files should use the <br>
locale encoding as well as the window and icon name. With
Xft the situation is bit different as Xft supports only
iso10646-1 and iso8859-1. If you do not specify one of these
<br>
encodings in the Xft font name, then fvwm does strings
conversion using (iii). Note that with multibyte fonts (and
in particular with &quot;CJK&quot; fonts) for good text
rendering, the <br>
locale encoding should be the charset of the font.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To override the previous rules,
it is possible to specify the string encoding in the
beginning of a font description as follow:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">StringEncoding=enc:_full_font_name_</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where enc is an encoding
supported by fvwm (usually font name charset plus some
unicode encodings: UTF-8, USC-2, USC-4 and UTF-16).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, you may use an
iso8859-1 locale charset and have an FvwmForm in Russian
using koi8-r encoding. In this case, you just have to ask
FvwmForm to load a koi8-r font by <br>
specifying the encoding in the font name. With a multibyte
language, (as multibyte font works well only if the locale
encoding is the charset of the font), you should use an <br>
iso10646-1 font:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">StringEncoding=jisx0208.1983-0:-*-fixed-medium-r-*-ja-*-iso10646-1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;StringEncoding=jisx0208.1983-0:xft:Bitstream
Cyberbit&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if your FvwmForm configuration
uses jisx0208.1983-0 encoding. Another possibility is to use
UTF-8 encoding for your FvwmForm configuration and use an
iso10646-1 font:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-*-fixed-medium-r-*-ja-*-iso10646-1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;StringEncoding=UTF-8:xft:Bitstream
Cyberbit&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or equivalently</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;xft:Bitstream
Cyberbit:encoding=iso10646-1&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In general iso10646-1 fonts
together with UTF-8 string encoding allows the display of
any characters in a given menu, FvwmForm etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">More and more, unicode is used
and text files use UTF-8 encoding. However, in practice the
characters used range over your locale charset (this is the
case when you generate a <br>
menu with fvwm-menu-desktop with recent versions of KDE and
GNOME). For saving memory (an iso10646-1 font may have a
very large number of characters) or because you have a <br>
pretty font without an iso10646-1 charset, you can specify
the string encoding to be UTF-8 and use a font in the locale
charset:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">StringEncoding=UTF-8:-*-pretty_font-*-12-*</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In most cases, fvwm correctly
determines the encoding of the font. However, some fonts do
not end with valid encoding names. When the font name
isn&rsquo;t normal, for example:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-misc-fixed-*--20-*-my_utf8-36</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">you need to add the encoding
after the font name using a slash as a delimiter. For
example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MenuStyle * Font
-misc-fixed-*--20-*-my_utf8-36/iso10646-1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If fvwm finds an encoding, fvwm
uses the iconv system functions to do conversion between
encodings. Unfortunately, there are no standards. For
conversion between iso8859-1 and <br>
UTF-8: a GNU system uses &quot;ISO-8859-1&quot; and other
systems use &quot;iso881&quot; to define the converters
(these two names are supported by fvwm). Moreover, in some
cases it may be <br>
necessary to use machine specific converters. So, if you
experience problems you can try to get information on your
iconv implementation (&quot;man iconv&quot; may help) and
put the name <br>
which defines the converter between the font encoding and
UTF-8 at the end of the font name after the encoding hint
and a / (another possible solution is to use GNU libiconv).
<br>
For example use:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Style * Font
-misc-fixed-*--14-*-iso8859-1/*/latin1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">to use latin1 for defining the
converter for the iso8859-1 encoding. The &quot;*&quot; in
between the &quot;/&quot; says to fvwm to determine the
encoding from the end of the font name. Use:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Style * Font
-misc-fixed-*--14-*-local8859-6/iso8859-6/local_iso8859_6_iconv</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">to force fvwm to use the font
with iso8859-6 as the encoding (this is useful for
bi-directionality) and to use local_iso8859_6_iconv for
defining the converters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Font Shadow Effects <br>
Fonts can be given 3d effects. At the beginning of the font
name (or just after a possible StringEncoding specification)
add</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Shadow=size [offset]
[directions]]:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">size is a positive integer which
specifies the number of pixels of shadow. offset is an
optional positive integer which defines the number of pixels
to offset the shadow from <br>
the edge of the character. The default offset is zero.
directions is an optional set of directions the shadow
emanates from the character. The directions are a space
separated <br>
list of fvwm directions:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">N, North, Top, t, Up, u, -</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">E, East, Right, r, Right, r,
]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">S, South, Bottom, b, Down, d,
_</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">W, West, Left, l, Left, l, [</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NE, NorthEast, TopRight, tr,
UpRight, ur, ^</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SE, SouthEast, BottomRight, br,
DownRight, dr, &gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SW, SouthWest, BottomLeft, bl,
DownLeft, dl, v</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NW, NorthWest, TopLeft, tl,
UpLeft, ul, &lt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C, Center, Centre, .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A shadow is displayed in each
given direction. All is equivalent to all the directions.
The default direction is BottomRight. With the Center
direction, the shadow surrounds <br>
the whole string. Since this is a super set of all other
directions, it is a waste of time to specify this along with
any other directions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The shadow effect only works
with colorsets. The color of the shadow is defined by using
the fgsh option of the Colorset command. Please refer to the
Colorsets section for <br>
details about colorsets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: It can be difficult to
find the font, fg, fgsh and bg colors to make this effect
look good, but it can look quite good.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BI-DIRECTIONAL TEXT <br>
Arabic and Hebrew text require bi-directional text support
to be displayed correctly, this means that logical strings
should be converted before their visual presentation, so
<br>
left-to-right and right-to-left sub-strings are determined
and reshuffled. In fvwm this is done automatically in window
titles, menus, module labels and other places if the <br>
fonts used for displaying the text are of one of the
charsets that require bidi (bi-directional) support. For
example, this includes iso8859-6, iso8859-8 and iso10646-1
<br>
(unicode), but not other iso8859-* fonts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This bi-directional text support
is done using the fribidi library compile time option, see
INSTALL.fvwm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS <br>
Almost all window manager operations can be performed from
the keyboard so mouse-less operation should be possible. In
addition to scrolling around the virtual desktop by <br>
binding the Scroll command to appropriate keys, Popup, Move,
Resize, and any other command can be bound to keys. Once a
command is started the pointer is moved by using the up,
<br>
down, left, and right arrows, and the action is terminated
by pressing return. Holding down the Shift key causes the
pointer movement to go in larger steps and holding down the
<br>
control key causes the pointer movement to go in smaller
steps. Standard emacs and vi cursor movement controls ( n ,
p , f , b , and j , k , h , l ) can be used instead of the
<br>
arrow keys.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SESSION MANAGEMENT <br>
Fvwm supports session management according to the X Session
Management Protocol. It saves and restores window position,
size, stacking order, desk, stickiness, shadiness, <br>
maximizedness, iconifiedness for all windows. Furthermore,
some global state is saved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fvwm doesn&rsquo;t save any
information regarding styles, decors, functions or menus. If
you change any of these resources during a session (e.g. by
issuing Style commands or by using <br>
various modules), these changes are lost after saving and
restarting the session. To become permanent, such changes
have to be added to the configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note further that the current
implementation has the following anomaly when used on a
multi-screen display: Starting fvwm for the first time, fvwm
manages all screens by forking <br>
a copy of itself for each screen. Every copy knows its
parent and issuing a Quit command to any instance of fvwm
kills the master and thus all copies of fvwm. When you save
and <br>
restart the session, the session manager brings up a copy of
fvwm on each screen, but this time they are started as
individual instances managing one screen only. Thus a Quit
<br>
kills only the copy it was sent to. This is probably not a
very serious problem, since with session management, you are
supposed to quit a session through the session manager <br>
anyway. If it is really needed,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Exec exec killall fvwm</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">still kills all copies of fvwm.
Your system must have the killall command though.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BOOLEAN ARGUMENTS <br>
A number of commands take one or several boolean arguments.
These take a few equivalent inputs: &quot;yes&quot;,
&quot;on&quot;, &quot;true&quot;, &quot;t&quot; and
&quot;y&quot; all evaluate to true while &quot;no&quot;,
&quot;off&quot;, &quot;false&quot;, <br>
&quot;f&quot; and &quot;n&quot; evaluate to false. Some
commands allow &quot;toggle&quot; too which means that the
feature is disabled if it is currently enabled and vice
versa.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUILTIN KEY AND MOUSE BINDINGS
<br>
The following commands are built-in to fvwm:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Key Help R A Popup MenuFvwmRoot
<br>
Key F1 R A Popup MenuFvwmRoot <br>
Key Tab A M WindowList Root c c NoDeskSort <br>
Key Escape A MC EscapeFunc <br>
Mouse 1 R A Menu MenuFvwmRoot <br>
Mouse 1 T A FuncFvwmRaiseLowerX Move <br>
Mouse 1 FS A FuncFvwmRaiseLowerX Resize <br>
Mouse 2 FST A FuncFvwmRaiseLowerX Move <br>
AddToFunc FuncFvwmRaiseLowerX <br>
+ I Raise <br>
+ M $0 <br>
+ D Lower</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Help and F1 keys invoke a
built-in menu that fvwm creates. This is primarily for new
users that have not created their own configuration file.
Either key on the root <br>
(background) window pops up an menu to help you get
started.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Tab key pressed anywhere
with the Meta key (same as the Alt key on PC keyboards) held
down pop-ups a window list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mouse button 1 on the title-bar
or side frame can move, raise or lower a window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mouse button 1 on the window
corners can resize, raise or lower a window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can override or remove these
bindings. To remove the window list binding, use this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Key Tab A M -</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMAND EXECUTION <br>
Module and Function Commands <br>
If fvwm encounters a command that it doesn&rsquo;t
recognize, it checks to see if the specified command should
have been</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Function (rest of command)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Module (rest of command)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This allows complex functions or
modules to be invoked in a manner which is fairly
transparent to the configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example: the config file
contains the line</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HelpMe</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fvwm looks for an fvwm command
called &quot;HelpMe&quot;, and fails. Next it looks for a
user-defined complex function called &quot;HelpMe&quot;. If
no such function exists, fvwm tries to execute <br>
a module called &quot;HelpMe&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Delayed Execution of Commands
<br>
Note: There are many commands that affect look and feel of
specific, some or all windows, like Style, Mouse, Colorset,
TitleStyle and many others. For performance reasons such
<br>
changes are not applied immediately but only when fvwm is
idle, i.e. no user interaction or module input is pending.
Specifically, new Style options that are set in a function
<br>
are not applied until after the function has completed. This
can sometimes lead to unwanted effects.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To force that all pending
changes are applied immediately, use the UpdateStyles,
Refresh or RefreshWindow commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">QUOTING <br>
Quotes are required only when needed to make fvwm consider
two or more words to be a single argument. Unnecessary
quoting is allowed. If you want a quote character in your
<br>
text, you must escape it by using the backslash character.
For example, if you have a pop-up menu called
&quot;Window-Ops&quot;, then you do not need quotes:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Popup Window-Ops</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">but if you replace the dash with
a space, then you need quotes:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Popup &quot;Window Ops&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The supported quoting characters
are double quotes, single quotes and reverse single quotes.
All three kinds of quotes are treated in the same way.
Single characters can be <br>
quoted with a preceding backslash. Quoting single characters
works even inside other kinds of quotes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMAND EXPANSION <br>
Whenever an fvwm command line is executed, fvwm performs
parameter expansion. A parameter is a &rsquo;$&rsquo;
followed by a word enclosed in brackets ($[...]) or a single
special <br>
character. If fvwm encounters an unquoted parameter on the
command line it expands it to a string indicated by the
parameter name. Unknown parameters are left untouched. <br>
Parameter expansion is performed before quoting. To get a
literal &rsquo;$&rsquo; use &quot;$$&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a command is prefixed with a
&rsquo;-&rsquo; parameter expansion isn&rsquo;t performed.
This applies to the command immediately following the
&rsquo;-&rsquo;, in which the expansion normally would have
<br>
taken place. When uesed together with other prefix commands
it must be added before the other prefix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pick -Exec exec xmessage
&rsquo;$[w.name]&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">opens an xmessage dialog with
&quot;$[w.name]&quot; unexpanded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The longer variables may contain
additional variables inside the name, which are expanded
before the outer variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In earlier versions of fvwm,
some single letter variables were supported. It is
deprecated now, since they cause a number of problems. You
should use the longer substitutes <br>
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Print the current desk number,
horizontal page number <br>
# and the window&rsquo;s class (unexpanded here, no window).
<br>
Echo $[desk.n] $[page.nx] $[w.class]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: If the command is called
outside a window context, it prints &quot;$[w.class]&quot;
instead of the class name. It is usually not enough to have
the pointer over a window to have a <br>
context window. To force using the window with the focus,
the Current command can be used:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Current Echo $[desk.n]
$[page.nx] $[w.class]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The parameters known by fvwm
are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$$ <br>
A literal &rsquo;$&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$. <br>
The absolute directory of the currently Read file. Intended
for creating relative and relocatable configuration trees.
If used outside of any read file, the returned value <br>
is &rsquo;.&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$0 to $9 <br>
The positional parameters given to a complex function (a
function that has been defined with the AddToFunc command).
&quot;$0&quot; is replaced with the first parameter,
&quot;$1&quot; with the <br>
second parameter and so on. If the corresponding parameter
is undefined, the &quot;$...&quot; is deleted from the
command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$* <br>
All positional parameters given to a complex function. This
includes parameters that follow after &quot;$9&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$[n] <br>
The n:th positional parameter given to a complex function,
counting from 0. If the corresponding parameter is
undefined, the &quot;$[n]&quot; is deleted from the command
line. The <br>
parameter is expanded unquoted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$[n-m] <br>
The positional parameters given to a complex function,
starting with parameter n and ending with parameter m. If
all the corresponding parameters are undefined, the
&quot;$[...]&quot; <br>
is deleted from the command line. If only some of the
parameters are defined, all defined parameters are expanded,
and the remaining silently ignored. All parameters are <br>
expanded unquoted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$[n-] <br>
All the positional parameters given to a complex function,
starting with parameter n. If all the corresponding
parameters are undefined, the &quot;$[...]&quot; is deleted
from the <br>
command line. All parameters are expanded unquoted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$[*] <br>
All the positional parameters given to a complex function.
This is equivalent of $[0-].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$[version.num] <br>
The version number, like &quot;2.6.0&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$[version.info] <br>
The version info, like &quot; (from cvs)&quot;, empty for
the official releases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$[version.line] <br>
The first line printed by the --version command line
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$[vp.x] $[vp.y] $[vp.width]
$[vp.height] <br>
Either coordinate or the width or height of the current
viewport.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$[wa.x] $[wa.y] $[wa.width]
$[wa.height] <br>
Either coordinate or the width or height of the EWMH working
area.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$[dwa.x] $[dwa.y] $[dwa.width]
$[dwa.height] <br>
Either coordinate or the width or height of the dynamic EWMH
working area.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$[desk.n] <br>
The current desk number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$[desk.name&lt;n&gt;] <br>
These parameters are replaced with the name of the desktop
number &lt;n&gt; that is defined with the DesktopName
command. If no name is defined, then the default name is
returned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$[desk.width] $[desk.height]
<br>
The width or height of the whole desktop, i.e. the width or
height multiplied by the number of pages in x or y
direction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$[desk.pagesx] $[desk.pagesy]
<br>
The number of total pages in a desk in x or y direction.
This is the same as the values set by DesktopSize.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$[page.nx] $[page.ny] <br>
The current page numbers, by X and Y axes, starting from 0.
page is equivalent to area in the GNOME terminology.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$[w.id] <br>
The window-id (expressed in hex, e.g. 0x10023c) of the
window the command was called for or &quot;$[w.id]&quot; if
no window is associated with the command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$[w.name] $[w.iconname]
$[w.class] $[w.resource] $[w.visiblename] $[w.iconfile]
$[w.miniiconfile] $[w.iconfile.svgopts]
$[w.miniiconfile.svgopts] <br>
The window&rsquo;s name, icon name, resource class and
resource name, visible name, file name of its icon or mini
icon defined with the Icon or MiniIcon style (including the
full <br>
path if the file was found on disk), and (if fvwm is
compiled with SVG support) the icon or mini icon svg
rendering options (including the leading colon), or
unexpanded <br>
&quot;$[w.&lt;attribute&gt;]&quot; string if no window is
associated with the command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note, the first 5 variables may
include any kind of characters, so these variables are
quoted. It means that the value is surrounded by single
quote characters and any <br>
contained single quote is prefixed with a backslash. This
guarantees that commands like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Style $[w.resource] Icon
norm/network.png</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">work correctly, regardless of
any special symbols the value may contain, like spaces and
different kinds of quotes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the case of the
window&rsquo;s visible name, this is the value returned from
the literal title of the window shown in the titlebar.
Typically this will be the same as $[w.name] <br>
once expanded, although in the case of using
IndexedWindowName then this is more useful a distinction,
and allows for referencing the specific window by its
visible name for <br>
inclusion in things like Style commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$[w.x] $[w.y] $[w.width]
$[w.height] <br>
Either coordinate or the width or height of the current
window if it is not iconified. If no window is associated
with the command or the window is iconified, the string is
<br>
left as is.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$[w.desk] <br>
The number of the desk on which the window is shown. If the
window is sticky the current desk number is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$[w.layer] <br>
The layer of the window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$[w.screen] <br>
The screen number the window is on. If Xinerama is not
present, this returns the number 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$[cw.x] $[cw.y] $[cw.width]
$[cw.height] <br>
These work like $[w....] but return the geometry of the
client part of the window. In other words: the border and
title of the window is not taken into account.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$[i.x], $[it.x], $[ip.x] $[i.y],
$[it.y], $[ip.y] $[i.width], $[it.width], $[ip.width]
$[i.height], $[it.height], $[ip.height] <br>
These work like $[w....] but return the geometry of the icon
($[i....]), the icon title ($[it....]) or the icon picture
($[ip....]).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$[pointer.x] $[pointer.y] <br>
These return the position of the pointer on the screen. If
the pointer is not on the screen, these variables are not
expanded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$[pointer.wx] $[pointer.wy] <br>
These return the position of the pointer in the selected
window. If the pointer is not on the screen, the window is
iconified or no window is selected, these variables are <br>
not expanded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$[pointer.cx] $[pointer.cy] <br>
These return the position of the pointer in the client
portion of the selected window. If the pointer is not on the
screen, the window is shaded or iconified or no window is
<br>
selected, these variables are not expanded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$[pointer.screen] <br>
The screen number the pointer is currently on. Returns 0 if
Xinerama is not enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$[screen] <br>
The screen number fvwm is running on. Useful for setups with
multiple screens.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$[fg.cs&lt;n&gt;]
$[bg.cs&lt;n&gt;] $[hilight.cs&lt;n&gt;]
$[shadow.cs&lt;n&gt;] <br>
These parameters are replaced with the name of the
foreground (fg), background (bg), hilight (hilight) or
shadow (shadow) color that is defined in colorset &lt;n&gt;
(replace &lt;n&gt; <br>
with zero or a positive integer). For example
&quot;$[fg.cs3]&quot; is expanded to the name of the
foreground color of colorset 3 (in rgb:rrrr/gggg/bbbb form).
Please refer to the <br>
Colorsets section for details about colorsets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$[schedule.last] <br>
This is replaced by the id of the last command that was
scheduled with the Schedule command, even if this command
was already executed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$[schedule.next] <br>
This is replaced by the id the next command used with
Schedule will get (unless a different id is specified
explicitly).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$[cond.rc] <br>
The return code of the last conditional command. This
variable is only valid inside a function and can not be used
in a conditional command. Please refer to the section <br>
Conditional Commands in the command list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$[func.context] <br>
The context character of the running command as used in the
Mouse, Key or PointerKey command. This is useful for example
with:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mouse 3 FS N WindowShade
$$[func.context]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$[gt.str] <br>
return the translation of str by looking in the current
locale catalogs. If no translation is found str is returned
as is. See the LocalePath command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$[infostore.key] <br>
Return the value of the item stored in the InfoStore at the
given key. If no key is present, the unexpanded string is
returned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$[...] <br>
If the string within the braces is neither of the above,
fvwm tries to find an environment variable with this name
and replaces its value if one is found (e.g.
&quot;$[PAGER]&quot; <br>
could be replaced by &quot;more&quot;). Otherwise the string
is left as is.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some examples can be found in
the description of the AddToFunc command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SCRIPTING &amp; COMPLEX
FUNCTIONS <br>
To achieve the more complex effects, fvwm has a number of
commands that improve its scripting abilities. Scripts can
be read from a file with Read, from the output of a command
<br>
with PipeRead or written as a complex function with the
AddToFunc command. For the curious, section 7 of the fvwm
FAQ shows some real life applications of scripting. Please
<br>
refer to the sections User Functions and Shell Commands and
Conditional Commands for details. A word of warning: during
execution of complex functions, fvwm needs to take all <br>
input from the mouse pointer (the pointer is
&quot;grabbed&quot; in the slang of X). No other programs
can receive any input from the pointer while a function is
run. This can confuse <br>
some programs. For example, the xwd program refuses to make
screen shots when run from a complex function. To achieve
the same functionality you can use the Read or PipeRead <br>
command instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Menus <br>
Before a menu can be opened, it has to be populated with
menu items using the AddToMenu command and bound to a key or
mouse button with the Key, PointerKey or Mouse command <br>
(there are many other ways to invoke a menu too). This is
usually done in the configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fvwm menus are extremely
configurable in look and feel. Even the slightest nuances
can be changed to the user&rsquo;s liking, including the
menu item fonts, the background, delays <br>
before popping up sub menus, generating menus dynamically
and many other features. Please refer to the MenuStyle
command to learn more.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Types of Menus <br>
In fvwm there are four slightly different types of
menus:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Popup menus can appear
everywhere on the screen on their own or attached to a part
of a window. The Popup command opens popup menus. If the
popup menu was invoked with a <br>
mouse button held down, it is closed when the button is
released. The item under the pointer is then activated and
the associated action is executed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Menu is a very similar command,
but the menus it opens are slightly less transient. When
invoked by clicking a mouse button, it stays open and can be
navigated with no <br>
button held. But if it is invoked by a button press followed
by mouse motion, it behaves exactly like a popup menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tear off menus or Pin up menus
are menus from either of the above two commands that have
been &quot;torn off&quot; their original context and pinned
on the desktop like a normal <br>
window. They are created from other menus by certain key
presses or mouse sequences or with the TearMenuOff command
from inside a menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sub menus are menus inside
menus. When a menu item that has the Popup command as its
action is selected, the named menu is opened as an inferior
menu to the parent. Any <br>
type of menu can have sub menus.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Menu Anatomy <br>
Menus consist of any number of titles which are inactive
menu items that usually appear at the top of the menu,
normal items triggering various actions when selected, <br>
separator lines between the items, tear off bars (a
horizontal broken line) that tear off the menu when
selected, and sub menu items indicated with a triangle
pointing <br>
left or right, depending on the direction in which the sub
menu appears. All the above menu items are optional.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Additionally, if the menu is too
long to fit on the screen, the excess menu items are put in
a continuation menu and a sub menu with the string
&quot;More...&quot; is placed at the <br>
bottom of the menu. The &quot;More...&quot; string honors
the locale settings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, there may be a picture
running up either side of the menu (a &quot;side
bar&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Menu Navigation <br>
Menus can be navigated either with the keyboard or with the
mouse. Many people prefer to use the mouse, but it can be
rather tedious. Once you get the hang of it, <br>
keyboard navigation can be much faster. While fvwm displays
a menu, it can do nothing else. For example, new windows do
not appear before the menu is closed. However, <br>
this is not exactly true for tear off menus. See the Tear
Off Menus section for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mouse Navigation <br>
Moving the pointer over a menu selects the item below it.
Normally this is indicated by a 3d border around the item,
but not all parts of a menu can be selected. <br>
Pressing any mouse button while a menu is open by default
activates the item below it. Items of a popup menu are also
activated by releasing a held mouse button. In case <br>
of an item that hides a sub menu, the sub menu is displayed
if the pointer hovers over the item long enough or moves
close to the triangle indicating the sub menu. This <br>
behaviour can be tuned with menu styles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Scrolling a mouse wheel over a
menu either wraps the pointer along the menu (default),
scrolls the menu under the pointer or act as if the menu was
clicked depending on <br>
the MouseWheel menu style.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Clicking on a selected item
activates it - what happens exactly depends on the type of
the item.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Clicking on a title, a
separator, the side bar, or outside the menu closes the menu
(exception: tear off menus can not be closed this way).
Pressing mouse button 2 over a <br>
menu title or activating a tear off bar creates a tear off
menu from the current menu. Clicking on a normal menu item
invokes the command that is bound to it, and <br>
clicking on a sub menu item either closes all open menus and
replaces them with the sub menu or posts the menu
(default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Posting menus is meant to ease
mouse navigation. Once a sub menu is posted, only items from
that sub menu can be selected. This can be very useful to
navigate the menu <br>
if the pointer tends to stray off the menu. To unpost the
menu and revert back to normal operation, either click on
the same sub menu item or press any key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Keyboard Navigation <br>
Just like with mouse navigation, the item below the pointer
is selected. This is achieved by warping the pointer to the
menu items when necessary. While a menu is open, <br>
all key presses are intercepted by the menu. No other
application can get keyboard input (although this is not the
case for tear off menus).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Items can be selected directly
by pressing a hotkey that can be configured individually for
each menu item. The hotkey is indicated by underlining it in
the menu item <br>
label. With the AutomaticHotkeys menu style fvwm
automatically assigns hotkeys to all menu items.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The most basic keys to navigate
through menus are the cursor keys (move up or down one item,
enter or leave a sub menu), Space (activate item) and Escape
(close menu). <br>
Numerous other keys can be used to navigate through menus by
default:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enter, Return, Space activate
the current item.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Escape, Delete, Ctrl-G exit the
current sequence of menus or destroy a tear off menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">J, N, Cursor-Down, Tab,
Meta-Tab, Ctrl-F, move to the next item.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">K, P, Cursor-Up, Shift-Tab,
Shift-Meta-Tab, Ctrl-B, move to the prior item.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">L, Cursor-Right, F enter a sub
menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">H, Cursor-Left, B return to the
prior menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ctrl-Cursor-Up, Ctrl-K Ctrl-P,
Shift-Ctrl-Meta-Tab, Page-Up move up five items.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ctrl-Cursor-Down, Ctrl-J Ctrl-N,
Ctrl-Meta-Tab Page-Down move down five items.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Shift-P, Home, Shift-Cursor-Up,
Ctrl-A move to the first item.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Shift-N, End, Shift-Cursor-Down,
Ctrl-E move to the last item.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Meta-P, Meta-Cursor-Up,
Ctrl-Cursor-Left, Shift-Ctrl-Tab, move up just below the
next separator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Meta-N, Meta-Cursor-Down,
Ctrl-Cursor-Right, Ctrl-Tab, move down just below the next
separator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Insert opens the
&quot;More...&quot; sub menu if any.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Backspace tears off the
menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Menu Bindings <br>
The keys and mouse buttons used to navigate the menu can be
configured using the Key and Mouse commands with the special
context &rsquo;M&rsquo;, possible combined with
&rsquo;T&rsquo; for the <br>
menu title, &rsquo;I&rsquo; for other menu items,
&rsquo;S&rsquo; for any border or sidepic, &rsquo;[&rsquo;
for left border including a left sidepic, &rsquo;]&rsquo;
for right border including a right sidepic, &rsquo;-&rsquo;
for <br>
top border, &rsquo;_&rsquo; for bottom border. The menu
context uses its own set of actions that can be bound to
keys and mouse buttons. These are MenuClose,
MenuCloseAndExec, <br>
MenuEnterContinuation, MenuEnterSubmenu, MenuLeaveSubmenu,
MenuMoveCursor, MenuCursorLeft, MenuCursorRight,
MenuSelectItem, MenuScroll and MenuTearOff.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is not possible to override
the key Escape with no modifiers for closing the menu.
Neither is it possible to undefine mouse button 1, the arrow
keys or the enter key <br>
for minimal navigation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MenuClose exits from the current
sequence of menus or destroys a tear off menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MenuCloseAndExec exits from the
current sequence of menus or destroys a tear off menu and
executes the rest of the line as a command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MenuEnterContinuation opens the
&quot;More...&quot; sub menu if any.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MenuEnterSubmenu enters a sub
menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MenuLeaveSubmenu returns to the
prior menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MenuMoveCursor n [m] moves the
selection to another item. If the first argument is zero the
second argument specifies an absolute item in the menu to
move the pointer to. <br>
Negative items are counted from the end of the menu. If the
first argument is non-zero, the second argument must be
omitted, and the first argument specifies a relative <br>
change in the selected item. The positions may be suffixed
with a &rsquo;s&rsquo; to indicate that the items should
refer only to the first items after separators.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MenuCursorLeft enters a sub menu
with the SubmenusLeft menu style, and returns to the prior
menu with the SubmenusRight menu style.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MenuCursorRight enters a sub
menu with the SubmenusRight menu style, and returns to the
prior menu with the SubmenusLeft menu style.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MenuSelectItem triggers the
action for the menu item.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MenuScroll n performs menu
scrolling according to the MouseWheel menu style with n
items. The distance can be suffixed with an &rsquo;s&rsquo;
to indicate the items should refer only <br>
to the first items after separators.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MenuTearOff turns a normal menu
into a &quot;torn off&quot; menu. See Tear Off Menus for
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tear Off Menus <br>
A tear off menu is any menu that has been &quot;torn
off&quot; the window it was attached to and pinned to the
root window. There are three ways to tear off a menu: click
on the <br>
menu title with mouse button 2, press Backspace in the menu
or activate its tear off bar (a horizontal bar with a broken
line). Tear off bars must be added to the menu as <br>
any other item by assigning them the command
TearMenuOff.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The builtin tear off actions can
be overridden by undefining the builtin menu actions bound
to tear off. To remove the builtin mouse button 2 binding,
use:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mouse 2 MT A -</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and to remove the builtin
backspace binding, use:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Key Backspace M A -</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See the section Menu Bindings
for details on how to assign other bindings for tear
off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that prior to fvwm 2.5.20
the tear off mouse bindings were redefined in different way,
which no longer work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The window containing the menu
is placed as any other window would be. If you find it
confusing to have your tear off menus appear at random
positions on the screen, put <br>
this line in your configuration file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Style fvwm_menu UsePPosition</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To remove borders and buttons
from a tear-off menu but keep the menu title, you can
use</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Style fvwm_menu !Button 0,
!Button 1 <br>
Style fvwm_menu !Button 2, !Button 3 <br>
Style fvwm_menu !Button 4, !Button 5 <br>
Style fvwm_menu !Button 6, !Button 7 <br>
Style fvwm_menu !Button 8, !Button 9 <br>
Style fvwm_menu Title, HandleWidth 0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A tear off menu is a cross
breeding between a window and a menu. The menu is swallowed
by a window and its title is stripped off and displayed in
the window title. The <br>
main advantage is that the menu becomes permanent -
activating an item does not close the menu. Therefore, it
can be used multiple times without reopening it. To destroy
<br>
such a menu, close its window or press the Escape key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tear off menus behave somewhat
differently than normal menus and windows. They do not take
the keyboard focus, but while the pointer is over one of
them, all key presses <br>
are sent to the menu. Other fvwm key bindings are disabled
as long as the pointer is inside the tear off menu or one of
its sub menus. When the pointer leaves this area, <br>
all sub menus are closed immediately. Note that the window
containing a tear off menu is never hilighted as if it had
the focus.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A tear off menu is an
independent copy of the menu it originated from. As such, it
is not affected by adding items to that menu or changing its
menu style.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To create a tear off menu
without opening the normal menu first, the option
TearOffImmediately can be added to the Menu or Popup
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AddToMenu menu-name [menu-label
action] <br>
Begins or adds to a menu definition. Typically a menu
definition looks like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AddToMenu Utilities Utilities
Title <br>
+ Xterm Exec exec xterm -e tcsh <br>
+ Rxvt Exec exec rxvt <br>
+ &quot;Remote Logins&quot; Popup Remote-Logins <br>
+ Top Exec exec rxvt -T Top -n Top -e top <br>
+ Calculator Exec exec xcalc <br>
+ Xman Exec exec xman <br>
+ Xmag Exec exec xmag <br>
+ emacs Exec exec xemacs <br>
+ Mail MailFunction xmh &quot;-font fixed&quot; <br>
+ &quot;&quot; Nop <br>
+ Modules Popup Module-Popup <br>
+ &quot;&quot; Nop <br>
+ Exit Fvwm Popup Quit-Verify</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The menu could be invoked
via</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mouse 1 R A Menu Utilities
Nop</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mouse 1 R A Popup Utilities</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is no end-of-menu symbol.
Menus do not have to be defined in a contiguous region of
the config file. The quoted (or first word) portion in the
above examples is <br>
the menu label, which appears in the menu when the user pops
it up. The remaining portion is an fvwm command which is
executed if the user selects that menu item. An <br>
empty menu-label (&quot;&quot;) and the Nop function are
used to insert a separator into the menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The keywords DynamicPopUpAction
and DynamicPopDownAction have a special meaning when used as
the name of a menu item. The action following the keyword is
executed <br>
whenever the menu is popped up or down. This way you can
implement dynamic menus. It is even possible to destroy
itself with DestroyMenu and the rebuild from scratch. <br>
When the menu has been destroyed (unless you used the
recreate option when destroying the menu), do not forget to
add the dynamic action again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: Do not trigger actions
that require user interaction. They may fail and may screw
up your menus. See the Silent command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning <br>
Do not issue MenuStyle commands as dynamic menu actions.
Chances are good that this crashes fvwm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are several configurable
scripts installed together with fvwm for automatic menu
generation. They have their own man pages. Some of them,
specifically <br>
fvwm-menu-directory and fvwm-menu-desktop, may be used with
DynamicPopupAction to create a directory listing or
GNOME/KDE application listing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example (File browser):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># You can find the shell script
fvwm_make_browse_menu.sh <br>
# in the utils/ directory of the distribution. <br>
AddToMenu BrowseMenu <br>
+ DynamicPopupAction PipeRead
&rsquo;fvwm_make_browse_menu.sh BrowseMenu&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example (Picture menu):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Build a menu of all .jpg files
in <br>
# $HOME/Pictures <br>
AddToMenu JpgMenu foo title <br>
+ DynamicPopupAction Function MakeJpgMenu</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AddToFunc MakeJpgMenu <br>
+ I DestroyMenu recreate JpgMenu <br>
+ I AddToMenu JpgMenu Pictures Title <br>
+ I PipeRead &rsquo;for i in $HOME/Pictures/*.jpg; do echo
AddToMenu JpgMenu &quot;&lsquo;basename $i&lsquo;&quot; Exec
xv $i; done&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The keyword
MissingSubmenuFunction has a similar meaning. It is executed
whenever you try to pop up a sub menu that does not exist.
With this function you can define and <br>
destroy menus on the fly. You can use any command after the
keyword, but if the name of an item (that is a submenu)
defined with AddToFunc follows it, fvwm executes this <br>
command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Function &lt;function-name&gt;
&lt;submenu-name&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">i.e. the name is passed to the
function as its first argument and can be referred to with
&quot;$0&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The fvwm-menu-directory script
mentioned above may be used with MissingSubmenuFunction to
create an up to date recursive directory listing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># There is another shell script
fvwm_make_directory_menu.sh <br>
# in the utils/ directory of the distribution. To use it,
<br>
# define this function in your configuration file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DestroyFunc
MakeMissingDirectoryMenu <br>
AddToFunc MakeMissingDirectoryMenu <br>
+ I PipeRead fvwm_make_directory_menu.sh $0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DestroyMenu SomeMenu <br>
AddToMenu SomeMenu <br>
+ MissingSubmenuFunction MakeMissingDirectoryMenu <br>
+ &quot;Root directory&quot; Popup /</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is another implementation
of the file browser that uses sub menus for
subdirectories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Titles can be used within the
menu. If you add the option top behind the keyword Title,
the title is added to the top of the menu. If there was a
title already, it is <br>
overwritten.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AddToMenu Utilities Tools Title
top</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All text up to the first Tab in
the menu label is aligned to the left side of the menu, all
text right of the first Tab is aligned to the left in a
second column and all <br>
text thereafter is placed right aligned in the third column.
All other Tab s are replaced by spaces. Note that you can
change this format with the ItemFormat option of <br>
the MenuStyle command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the menu-label contains an
ampersand (&rsquo;&amp;&rsquo;), the next character is taken
as a hot-key for the menu item. Hot-keys are underlined in
the label. To get a literal &rsquo;&amp;&rsquo;, <br>
insert &quot;&amp;&amp;&quot;. Pressing the hot-key moves
through the list of menu items with this hot-key or selects
an item that is the only one with this hot-key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the menu-label contains a
sub-string which is set off by stars, then the text between
the stars is expected to be the name of an image file to
insert in the menu. To <br>
get a literal &rsquo;*&rsquo;, insert &quot;**&quot;. For
example</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+ Calculator*xcalc.xpm* Exec
exec xcalc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">inserts a menu item labeled
&quot;Calculator&quot; with a picture of a calculator above
it. The following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+ *xcalc.xpm* Exec exec
xcalc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Omits the &quot;Calculator&quot;
label, but leaves the picture.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the menu-label contains a
sub-string which is set off by percent signs, then the text
between the percent signs is expected to be the name of
image file (a so called <br>
mini icon to insert to the left of the menu label. A second
mini icon that is drawn at the right side of the menu can be
given in the same way. To get a literal &rsquo;%&rsquo;,
<br>
insert &quot;%%&quot;. For example</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+ Calculator%xcalc.xpm% Exec
exec xcalc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">inserts a menu item labeled
&quot;Calculator&quot; with a picture of a calculator to the
left. The following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Omits the &quot;Calculator&quot;
label, but leaves the picture. The pictures used with this
feature should be small (perhaps 16x16).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the menu-name (not the label)
contains a sub-string which is set off by at signs
(&rsquo;@&rsquo;), then the text between them is expected to
be the name of an image file to draw <br>
along the left side of the menu (a side pixmap). You may
want to use the SidePic option of the MenuStyle command
instead. To get a literal &rsquo;@&rsquo;, insert
&quot;@@&quot;. For example</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AddToMenu
StartMenu@linux-menu.xpm@</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">creates a menu with a picture in
its bottom left corner.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the menu-name also contains a
sub-string surrounded by &rsquo;^&rsquo;s, then the text
between &rsquo;^&rsquo;s is expected to be the name of an
X11 color and the column containing the side <br>
picture is colored with that color. You can set this color
for a menu style using the SideColor option of the MenuStyle
command. To get a literal &rsquo;^&rsquo;, insert
&quot;^^&quot;. <br>
Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AddToMenu
StartMenu@linux-menu.xpm@^blue^</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">creates a menu with a picture in
its bottom left corner and colors with blue the region of
the menu containing the picture.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In all the above cases, the name
of the resulting menu is name specified, stripped of the
substrings between the various delimiters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ChangeMenuStyle menustyle menu
... <br>
Changes the menu style of menu to menustyle. You may specify
more than one menu in each call of ChangeMenuStyle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CopyMenuStyle orig-menustyle
dest-menustyle <br>
Copy orig-menustyle to dest-menustyle, where orig-menustyle
is an existing menu style. If the menu style dest_menustyle
does not exist, then it is created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DestroyMenu [recreate] menu <br>
Deletes a menu, so that subsequent references to it are no
longer valid. You can use this to change the contents of a
menu during an fvwm session. The menu can be <br>
rebuilt using AddToMenu. The optional parameter recreate
tells fvwm not to throw away the menu completely but to
throw away all the menu items (including the title).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DestroyMenu Utilities</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DestroyMenuStyle menustyle <br>
Deletes the menu style named menustyle and changes all menus
using this style to the default style, you cannot destroy
the default menu style.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DestroyMenuStyle pixmap1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Menu menu-name [position]
[double-click-action] <br>
Causes a previously defined menu to be popped up in a sticky
manner. That is, if the user invokes the menu with a click
action instead of a drag action, the menu stays <br>
up. The command double-click-action is invoked if the user
double-clicks a button (or hits the key rapidly twice if the
menu is bound to a key) when bringing up the menu. <br>
If the double click action is not specified, double clicking
on the menu does nothing. However, if the menu begins with a
menu item (i.e. not with a title or a separator) <br>
and the double click action is not given, double clicking
invokes the first item of the menu (but only if the pointer
really was over the item).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The pointer is warped to where
it was when the menu was invoked if it was both invoked and
closed with a keystroke.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The position arguments allow
placement of the menu somewhere on the screen, for example
centered on the visible screen or above a title bar.
Basically it works like this: <br>
you specify a context-rectangle and an offset to this
rectangle by which the upper left corner of the menu is
moved from the upper left corner of the rectangle. The <br>
position arguments consist of several parts:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[context-rectangle] x y
[special-options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The context-rectangle can be one
of:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Root <br>
the root window of the current screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">XineramaRoot <br>
the root window of the whole Xinerama screen. Equivalent to
&quot;root&quot; when Xinerama is not used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mouse <br>
a 1x1 rectangle at the mouse position.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Window <br>
the frame of the context window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Interior <br>
the inside of the context window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Title <br>
the title of the context window or icon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Button&lt;n&gt; <br>
button #n of the context window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Icon <br>
the icon of the context window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Menu <br>
the current menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Item <br>
the current menu item.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Context <br>
the current window, menu or icon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This <br>
whatever widget the pointer is on (e.g. a corner of a window
or the root window).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Rectangle &lt;geometry&gt; <br>
the rectangle defined by &lt;geometry&gt; in X geometry
format. Width and height default to 1 if omitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the context-rectangle is
omitted or illegal (e.g. &quot;item&quot; on a window),
&quot;Mouse&quot; is the default. Note that not all of these
make sense under all circumstances (e.g. <br>
&quot;Icon&quot; if the pointer is on a menu).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The offset values x and y
specify how far the menu is moved from its default position.
By default, the numeric value given is interpreted as a
percentage of the context <br>
rectangle&rsquo;s width (height), but with a trailing
&rsquo;m&rsquo; the menu&rsquo;s width (height) is used
instead. Furthermore a trailing &rsquo;p&rsquo; changes the
interpretation to mean pixels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Instead of a single value you
can use a list of values. All additional numbers after the
first one are separated from their predecessor by their
sign. Do not use any <br>
other separators.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If x or y are prefixed with
&quot;&rsquo;o&lt;number&gt;&quot; where &lt;number&gt; is
an integer, the menu and the rectangle are moved to overlap
at the specified position before any other offsets <br>
are applied. The menu and the rectangle are placed so that
the pixel at &lt;number&gt; percent of the rectangle&rsquo;s
width/height is right over the pixel at &lt;number&gt;
percent of <br>
the menu&rsquo;s width/height. So &quot;o0&quot; means that
the top/left borders of the menu and the rectangle overlap,
with &quot;o100&quot; it&rsquo;s the bottom/right borders
and if you use &quot;o50&quot; <br>
they are centered upon each other (try it and you will see
it is much simpler than this description). The default is
&quot;o0&quot;. The prefix &quot;o&lt;number&gt;&quot; is an
abbreviation for <br>
&quot;+&lt;number&gt;-&lt;number&gt;m&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A prefix of &rsquo;c&rsquo; is
equivalent to &quot;o50&quot;. Examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># window list in the middle of
the screen <br>

+0 -100m</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that you can put a sub menu
far off the current menu so you could not reach it with the
mouse without leaving the menu. If the pointer leaves the
current menu in the <br>
general direction of the sub menu the menu stays up.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The special-options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To create a tear off menu
without opening the normal menu, add the option
TearOffImmediately. Normally the menu opens in normal state
for a split second before being torn <br>
off. As tearing off places the menu like any other window, a
position should be specified explicitly:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Forbid fvwm to place the menu
window <br>
Style &lt;name of menu&gt; UsePPosition <br>
# Menu at top left corner of screen <br>
Menu Root 0p 0p TearOffImmediately</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Animated and Mwm or Win menu
styles may move a menu somewhere else on the screen. If you
do not want this you can add Fixed as an option. This might
happen for <br>
example if you want the menu always in the top right corner
of the screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Where do you want a menu to
appear when you click on its menu item? The default is to
place the title under the cursor, but if you want it where
the position arguments <br>
say, use the SelectInPlace option. If you want the pointer
on the title of the menu, use SelectWarp too. Note that
these options apply only if the PopupAsRootMenu <br>
MenuStyle option is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The pointer is warped to the
title of a sub menu whenever the pointer would be on an item
when the sub menu is popped up (fvwm menu style) or never
warped to the title at <br>
all (Mwm or Win menu styles). You can force (forbid) warping
whenever the sub menu is opened with the WarpTitle (NoWarp)
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the special-options do
work with a normal menu that has no other position
arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MenuStyle stylename [options]
<br>
Sets a new menu style or changes a previously defined style.
The stylename is the style name; if it contains spaces or
tabs it has to be quoted. The name &quot;*&quot; is reserved
<br>
for the default menu style. The default menu style is used
for every menu-like object (e.g. the window created by the
WindowList command) that had not be assigned a style <br>
using the ChangeMenuStyle. See also DestroyMenuStyle. When
using monochrome color options are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fvwm, Mwm, Win reset all options
to the style with the same name in former versions of fvwm.
The default for new menu styles is Fvwm style. These options
override all <br>
others except Foreground, Background, Greyed, HilightBack,
ActiveFore and PopupDelay, so they should be used only as
the first option specified for a menu style or to <br>
reset the style to defined behavior. The same effect can be
created by setting all the other options one by one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mwm and Win style menus popup
sub menus automatically. Win menus indicate the current menu

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BorderWidth takes the thickness
of the border around the menus in pixels. It may be zero to
50 pixels. The default is 2. Using an illegal value reverts
the border width <br>
to the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Foreground and Background may
have a color name as an argument. This color is used for
menu text or the menu&rsquo;s background. You can omit the
color name to reset these <br>
colors to the built-in default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Greyed may have a color name as
an argument. This color is the one used to draw a
menu-selection which is prohibited (or not recommended) by
the Mwm hints which an <br>
application has specified. If the color is omitted the color
of greyed menu entries is based on the background color of
the menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HilightBack and !HilightBack
switch hilighting the background of the selected menu item
on and off. A specific background color may be used by
providing the color name as <br>
an argument to HilightBack. If you use this option without
an argument the color is based on the menu&rsquo;s
background color. The ActiveColorset option overrides the
<br>
specified color. If the colorset has a non solid background
it is used for the hilighting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HilightTitleBack switches
hilighting the background of menu titles on. If a
TitleColorset was used, the background colour is taken from
there. Otherwise the color is <br>
based on the menu&rsquo;s background color. If the colorset
has a non solid background it is used for the
hilighting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ActiveFore and !ActiveFore
switch hilighting the foreground of the selected menu item
on and off. A specific foreground color may be used by
providing the color name as <br>
an argument to ActiveFore. Omitting the color turns
hilighting on when an ActiveColorset is used. ActiveFore
turns off hilighting the foreground completely. The <br>
ActiveColorset option overrides the specified color.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MenuColorset controls if a
colorset is used instead of the Foreground, Background and
MenuFace menu styles. If the MenuColorset keyword is
followed by a number equal to <br>
zero or greater, this number is taken as the number of the
colorset to use. If the number is omitted, the colorset is
switched off and the regular menu styles are used <br>
again. The foreground and background colors of the menu
items are replaced by the colors from the colorset. If the
colorset has a pixmap defined, this pixmap is used as <br>
the background of the menu. Note that the MenuFace menu
style has been optimized for memory consumption and may use
less memory than the background from a colorset. The <br>
shape mask from the colorset is used to shape the menu.
Please refer to the Colorsets section for details about
colorsets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ActiveColorset works exactly
like MenuColorset, but the foreground from the colorset
replaces the color given with the ActiveFore menu style and
the colorset&rsquo;s background <br>
color replaces the color given with the HilightBack command
(to turn on background hilighting you have to use the
HilightBack menu style too). If specified, the hilight <br>
and shadow colors from the colorset are used too. The pixmap
and shape mask from the colorset are not used. Hilighting
the background or foreground can be turned off <br>
individually with the !ActiveFore or !HilightBack menu
styles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GreyedColorset works exactly
like MenuColorset, but the foreground from the colorset
replaces the color given with the Greyed menu style. No
other parts of the colorset <br>
are used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TitleColorset works exactly like
MenuColorset, but is used only for menu titles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hilight3DThick, Hilight3DThin
and Hilight3DOff determine if the selected menu item is
hilighted with a 3D relief. Thick reliefs are two pixels
wide, thin reliefs are one <br>
pixel wide.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hilight3DThickness takes one
numeric argument that may be between -50 and +50 pixels.
With negative values the menu item gets a pressed in look.
The above three commands <br>
are equivalent to a thickness of 2, 1 and 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Animation and !Animation turn
menu animation on or off. When animation is on, sub menus
that do not fit on the screen cause the parent menu to be
shifted to the left so <br>
the sub menu can be seen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Font and TitleFont take a font
name as an argument. If a font by this name exists it is
used for the text of all menu items. If it does not exist or
if the name is left <br>
blank the built-in default is used. If a TitleFont is given,
it is used for all menu titles instead of the normal
font.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MenuFace enforces a fancy
background upon the menus. You can use the same options for
MenuFace as for the ButtonStyle. See description of
ButtonStyle command and the <br>
Color Gradients sections for more information. If you use
MenuFace without arguments the style is reverted back to
normal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some examples of MenuFaces
are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MenuFace DGradient 128 2
lightgrey 50 blue 50 white <br>
MenuFace TiledPixmap texture10.xpm <br>
MenuFace HGradient 128 2 Red 40 Maroon 60 White <br>
MenuFace Solid Maroon</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: The gradient styles H, V,
B and D are optimized for high speed and low memory
consumption in menus. This is not the case for all the other
gradient styles. They <br>
may be slow and consume huge amounts of memory, so if you
encounter performance problems with them you may be better
off by not using them. To improve performance you can <br>
try one or all of the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Turn hilighting of the active
menu item other than foreground color off:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MenuStyle &lt;style&gt;
Hilight3DOff, !HilightBack <br>
MenuStyle &lt;style&gt; ActiveFore &lt;preferred
color&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Make sure sub menus do not
overlap the parent menu. This can prevent menus being
redrawn every time a sub menu pops up or down.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MenuStyle &lt;style&gt;
PopupOffset 1 100</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Run your X server with backing
storage. If your X Server is started with the -bs option,
turn it off. If not try the -wm and +bs options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">startx -- -wm +bs</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may have to adapt this
example to your system (e.g. if you use xinit to start
X).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PopupDelay requires one numeric
argument. This value is the delay in milliseconds before a
sub menu is popped up when the pointer moves over a menu
item that has a sub <br>
menu. If the value is zero no automatic pop up is done. If
the argument is omitted the built-in default is used. Note
that the popup delay has no effect if the <br>
PopupImmediately option is used since sub menus pop up
immediately then.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PopupImmediately makes menu
items with sub menus pop up it up as soon as the pointer
enters the item. The PopupDelay option is ignored then. If
PopupDelayed is used fvwm <br>
looks at the PopupDelay option if or when this automatic
popup happens.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PopdownDelay works exactly like
PopupDelay but determines the timeout of the PopupDelayed
style.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PopdownImmediately makes sub
menus vanish as soon as the pointer leaves the sub menu and
the correspondent item in the parent menu. With the opposite
option <br>
PopdownDelayed the sub menu only pops down after the time
specified with the PopdownDelay option. This comes handy
when the pointer often strays off the menu item when <br>
trying to move into the sub menu. Whenever there is a
conflict between the PopupImmediately, PopupDelayed,
PopupDelay styles and the PopdownImmediately,
PopdownDelayed, <br>
PopdownDelay styles, the Popup... styles win when using
mouse navigation and the Popdown... styles win when
navigating with the keyboard.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PopupOffset requires two integer
arguments. Both values affect where sub menus are placed
relative to the parent menu. If both values are zero, the
left edge of the sub <br>
menu overlaps the left edge of the parent menu. If the first
value is non-zero the sub menu is shifted that many pixels
to the right (or left if negative). If the second <br>
value is non-zero the menu is moved by that many percent of
the parent menu&rsquo;s width to the right or left.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PopupActiveArea requires an
integer value between 51 and 100. Normally, when the pointer
is over a menu item with a sub menu and the pointer enters
the area that starts <br>
at 75% of the menu width, the sub menu is shown immediately.
This percentage can be changed with PopupActiveArea. Setting
this value to 100 disables this kind of <br>
automatic popups altogether. The default value is restored
if no or an illegal value is given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TitleWarp and !TitleWarp affect
if the pointer warps to the menu title when a sub menu is
opened or not. Note that regardless of this setting the
pointer is not warped if <br>
the menu does not pop up under the pointer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TitleUnderlines0,
TitleUnderlines1 and TitleUnderlines2 specify how many lines
are drawn below a menu title.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SeparatorsLong and
SeparatorsShort set the length of menu separators. Long
separators run from the left edge all the way to the right
edge. Short separators leave a few <br>
pixels to the edges of the menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TrianglesSolid and
TrianglesRelief affect how the small triangles for sub menus
is drawn. Solid triangles are filled with a color while
relief triangles are hollow.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DoubleClickTime requires one
numeric argument. This value is the time in milliseconds
between two mouse clicks in a menu to be considered as a
double click. The default <br>
is 450 milliseconds. If the argument is omitted the double
click time is reset to this default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SidePic takes the name of an
image file as an argument. The picture is drawn along the
left side of the menu. The SidePic option can be overridden
by a menu specific <br>
side pixmap (see AddToMenu). If the file name is omitted an
existing side pixmap is removed from the menu style.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SideColor takes the name of an
X11 color as an argument. This color is used to color the
column containing the side picture (see above). The
SideColor option can be <br>
overridden by a menu specific side color (see AddToMenu). If
the color name is omitted the side color option is switched
off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PopupAsRootMenu, PopupAsSubmenu,
PopupIgnore and PopupClose change the behavior when you
click on a menu item that opens a sub menu. With
PopupAsRootMenu the original <br>
menu is closed before the sub menu appears, with
PopupAsSubmenu it is not, so you can navigate back into the
parent menu. Furthermore, with PopupAsSubmenu the sub menu
is <br>
held open (posted) regardless of where you move the mouse.
Depending on your menu style this may simplify navigating
through the menu. Any keystroke while a menu is <br>
posted reverts the menu back to the normal behavior. With
PopupClose the menu is closed when a sub menu item is
activated, and the menu stays open if PopupIgnore is used
<br>
(even if the menu was invoked with the Popup command).
PopupAsSubmenu is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RemoveSubmenus instructs fvwm to
remove sub menu when you move back into the parent menu.
With HoldSubmenus the sub menu remains visible. You probably
want to use <br>
HoldSubmenus if you are using the PopupDelayed style.
RemoveSubmenus affects menu navigation with the
keyboard.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SelectOnRelease takes an
optional key name as an argument. If the given key is
released in a menu using this style, the current menu item
is selected. This is intended <br>
for Alt-Tab WindowList navigation. The key name is a
standard X11 key name as defined in
/usr/include/X11/keysymdef.h, (without the XK_ prefix), or
the keysym database <br>
/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/XKeysymDB. To disable this behavior, omit
the key name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: Some X servers do not
support KeyRelease events. SelectOnRelease does not work on
such a machine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ItemFormat takes a special
string as its argument that determines the layout of the
menu items. Think of the format string as if it were a menu
item. All you have to do <br>
is tell fvwm where to place the different parts of the menu
item (i.e. the labels, the triangle denoting a sub menu, the
mini icons and the side pic) in the blank area. <br>
The string consists of spaces, Tab characters and formatting
directives beginning with &rsquo;%&rsquo;. Any illegal
characters and formatting directives are silently
ignored:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%l, %c and %r <br>
Insert the next item label. Up to three labels can be used.
The item column is left-aligned (%l), centered (%c) or
right-aligned (%r).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%i <br>
Inserts the mini icon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%&gt; and %&lt; <br>
Insert the sub menu triangle pointing either to the right
(%&gt;) or to the left (%&lt;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%| <br>
The first %| denotes the beginning of the area that is
highlighted either with a background color or a relief (or
both). The second %| marks the end of this area. %| <br>
can be used up to twice in the string. If you do not add one
or both of them, fvwm sets the margins to the margins of the
whole item (not counting the side picture).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%s <br>
Places the side picture either at the beginning or the end
of the menu. This directive may be used only once and only
as the first or last in the format string. If <br>
the %s is not at the beginning of the string, menus are not
drawn properly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Space, Tab, %Space and %Tab <br>
Add gap of one space, or a tab, using the width of the menu
font. When using a tab, the size of the gap can be one to 8
spaces since the tab position is a multiple of <br>
8 from the edge of the menu. The whole string must be quoted
if spaces or tabs are used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%p <br>
Like Space and Tab %p inserts an empty area into the item,
but with better control of its size (see below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can define an additional
space before and after each of the objects like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%left.rightp</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This means: if the object is
defined in the menu (e.g. if it is %s and you use a side
picture, or it is %l for the third column and there are
items defined that actually <br>
have a third column), then add left pixels before the object
and right pixels after it. You may leave out the left or the
.right parts if you do not need them. All <br>
values up to the screen width are allowed. Even negative
values can be used with care. The p may be replaced with any
other formatting directives described above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: Only items defined in the
format string are visible in the menus. So if you do not put
a %s in there you do not see a side picture, even if one is
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: The SubmenusLeft style
changes the default ItemFormat string, but if it was set
manually it is not modified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: If any unformatted title
of the menu is wider than the widest menu item, the spaces
between the different parts of the menu items are enlarged
to match the width of <br>
the title. Leading left aligned objects in the format string
(%l, %i, %&lt;, first %|) stick to the left edge of the menu
and trailing right aligned objects (%r, %i, %&gt;, <br>
second %|) stick to the right edge. The gaps between the
remaining items are enlarged equally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MenuStyle * ItemFormat
&quot;%.4s%.1|%.5i%.5l%.5l%.5r%.5i%2.3&gt;%1|&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Is the default string used by
fvwm: (side picture + 4 pixels gap) (beginning of the
hilighted area + 1 pixel gap) (mini icon + 5p) (first column
left aligned + 5p) (second <br>
column left aligned + 5p) (third column right aligned + 5p)
(second mini icon + 5p) (2p + sub menu triangle + 3p) (1p +
end of hilighted area).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MenuStyle * ItemFormat
&quot;%.1|%3.2&lt;%5i%5l%5l%5r%5i%1|%4s&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Is used by fvwm with the
SubmenusLeft option below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VerticalItemSpacing and
VerticalTitleSpacing control the vertical spacing of menu
items and titles like ItemFormat controls the horizontal
spacing. Both take two numeric <br>
arguments that may range from -100 to +100. The first is the
gap in pixels above a normal menu item (or a menu title),
the second is the gap in pixels below it. Negative <br>
numbers do not make much sense and may screw up the menu
completely. If no arguments are given or the given arguments
are invalid, the built-in defaults are used: one <br>
pixel above the item or title and two below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VerticalMargins can be used to
add some padding at the top and bottom of menus. It takes
two numeric arguments that must be positive integers (or
zero). If the number of <br>
arguments or its values are incorrect, fvwm defaults both to
0, which means no padding at all. If the values are correct,
the first one is used for the top margin, and <br>
the second one is used for the bottom margin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SubmenusLeft mirrors the menu
layout and behavior. Sub menus pop up to the left, the sub
menu triangle is drawn left and the mini icon and side
picture are drawn at the <br>
right side of the menu. The default is SubmenusRight. The
position hints of a menu are also affected by this setting,
i.e. position hints using item or menu as context <br>
rectangle and position hints using m offsets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AutomaticHotkeys and
!AutomaticHotkeys control the menu&rsquo;s ability to
automatically provide hot-keys on the first character of
each menu item&rsquo;s label. This behavior is <br>
always overridden if an explicit hot-key is assigned in the
AddToMenu command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UniqueHotkeyActivatesImmediate
and !UniqueHotkeyActivatesImmediate controls how menu items
are invoked when used with hotkeys. By default, if a given
menu entry only has <br>
one completeable match for a given hotkey, the action for
that menu entry is invoked and the menu is closed. This is
due to the UniqueHotkeyActivatesImmediate option. <br>
However, the menu can be told to remain open, waiting for
the user to invoke the selected item instead when there is
only one matched item for a given hotkey, by using the <br>
!UniqueHotkeyActivatesImmediate option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MouseWheel controls the ability
to scroll the menu using a mouse wheel. It takes one
argument, that can be one of ScrollsPointer, ScrollsMenu,
ScrollsMenuBackwards or <br>
ActivatesItem. ScrollsPointer makes the mouse wheel scroll
the pointer over a menu. This is the default. ScrollsMenu
and ScrollsMenuBackwards scroll the menu beneath <br>
the pointer. ActivatesItem disables scrolling by mouse wheel
and makes the use of a mouse wheel act as if the menu was
clicked. If no argument is supplied the default <br>
setting is restored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ScrollOffPage allows a menu to
be scrolled out of the visible area if MouseWheel is set to
ScrollsMenu or ScrollsMenuBackwards. This is the default.
The opposite, <br>
!ScrollOffPage disables this behaviour.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TrianglesUseFore draws sub menu
triangles with the foreground color of the menu colorset
(normally drawn with the hilight color). !TrianglesUseFore
disables this <br>
behaviour.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MenuStyle * Mwm <br>
MenuStyle * Foreground Black, Background gray40 <br>
MenuStyle * Greyed gray70, ActiveFore White <br>
MenuStyle * !HilightBack, Hilight3DOff <br>

MenuStyle red MenuFace DGradient 64 Red Black</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that all style options
could be placed on a single line for each style name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MenuStyle forecolor backcolor
shadecolor font style [anim] <br>
This is the old syntax of the MenuStyle command. It is
obsolete and may be removed in the future. Please use the
new syntax as described above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sets the menu style. When using
monochrome the colors are ignored. The shadecolor is the one
used to draw a menu-selection which is prohibited (or not
recommended) by <br>
the Mwm hints which an application has specified. The style
option is either Fvwm, Mwm or Win, which changes the
appearance and operation of the menus.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mwm and Win style menus popup
sub menus automatically. Win menus indicate the current menu
item by changing the background to black. Fvwm sub menus
overlap the parent <br>
menu, Mwm and Win style menus never overlap the parent
menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the anim option is given,
sub menus that do not fit on the screen cause the parent
menu to be shifted to the left so the sub menu can be seen.
See also SetAnimation <br>
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Popup PopupName [position]
[default-action] <br>
This command has two purposes: to bind a menu to a key or
mouse button, and to bind a sub menu into a menu. The
formats for the two purposes differ slightly. The <br>
position arguments are the same as for Menu. The command
default-action is invoked if the user clicks a button to
invoke the menu and releases it immediately again (or <br>
hits the key rapidly twice if the menu is bound to a key).
If the default action is not specified, double clicking on
the menu does nothing. However, if the menu begins <br>
with a menu item (i.e. not with a title or a separator) and
the default action is not given, double clicking invokes the
first item of the menu (but only if the pointer <br>
really was over the item).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To bind a previously defined
pop-up menu to a key or mouse button:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following example binds
mouse buttons 2 and 3 to a pop-up called &quot;Window
Ops&quot;. The menu pops up if the buttons 2 or 3 are
pressed in the window frame, side-bar, or <br>
title-bar, with no modifiers (none of shift, control, or
meta).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mouse 2 FST N Popup &quot;Window
Ops&quot; <br>
Mouse 3 FST N Popup &quot;Window Ops&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pop-ups can be bound to keys
through the use of the Key command. Pop-ups can be operated
without using the mouse by binding to keys and operating via
the up arrow, down <br>
arrow, and enter keys.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To bind a previously defined
pop-up menu to another menu, for use as a sub menu:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following example defines a
sub menu &quot;Quit-Verify&quot; and binds it into a main
menu, called &quot;RootMenu&quot;:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AddToMenu Quit-Verify <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Popup differs from Menu in that
pop-ups do not stay up if the user simply clicks. These are
popup-menus, which are a little hard on the wrist. Menu
menus stay up on a <br>
click action. See the Menu command for an explanation of the
interactive behavior of menus. A menu can be open up to ten
times at once, so a menu may even use itself or <br>
any of its predecessors as a sub menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TearMenuOff <br>
When assigned to a menu item, it inserts a tear off bar into
the menu (a horizontal broken line). Activating that item
tears off the menu. If the menu item has a label, <br>
it is shown instead of the broken line. If used outside
menus, this command does nothing. Examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AddToMenu WindowMenu <br>
+ I &quot;&quot; TearMenuOff</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AddToMenu RootMenu <br>
+ I &quot;click here to tear me off&quot; TearMenuOff</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Title <br>
Does nothing This is used to insert a title line in a popup
or menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Miscellaneous Commands <br>
BugOpts [option [bool]], ... <br>
This command controls several workarounds for bugs in third
party programs. The individual options are separated by
commas. The optional argument bool is a boolean <br>
argument and controls if the bug workaround is enabled or
not. It can either be &quot;True&quot; or &quot;False&quot;
to turn the option on or off, or &quot;toggle&quot; to
switch is back and forth. <br>
If bool is omitted, the default setting is restored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FlickeringMoveWorkaround
disables ConfigureNotify events that are usually sent to an
application while it is moved. If some windows flicker
annoyingly while being moved, <br>
this option may help you. Note that if this problem occurs
it is not an fvwm bug, it is a problem of the
application.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MixedVisualWorkaround makes fvwm
install the root colormap before it does some operations
using the root window visuals. This is only useful when the
-visual option is <br>
used to start fvwm and then only with some configurations of
some servers (e.g. Exceed 6.0 with an 8 bit PseudoColor root
and fvwm using a 24 bit TrueColor visual).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ModalityIsEvil option
controls whether Motif applications have the ability to have
modal dialogs (dialogs that force you to close them first
before you can do anything <br>
else). The default is to not allow applications to have
modal dialogs. Use this option with care. Once this option
is turned on, you have to restart fvwm to turn it <br>
off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RaiseOverNativeWindows makes
fvwm try to raise the windows it manages over native windows
of the X server&rsquo;s host system. This is needed for some
X servers running under <br>
Windows, Windows NT or Mac OS X. Fvwm tries to detect if it
is running under such an X server and initializes the flag
accordingly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RaiseOverUnmanaged makes fvwm
try to raise the windows it manages over override_redirect
windows. This is used to cope with ill-mannered applications
that use long-lived <br>
windows of this sort, contrary to ICCCM conventions. It is
useful with the Unmanaged style option too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FlickeringQtDialogsWorkaround
suppresses flickering of the focused window in some modules
when using KDE or QT applications with application modal
dialog windows. By <br>
default this option is turned on. This option may be
visually disturbing for other applications using windows not
managed by fvwm. Since these applications are rare it <br>
is most likely safe to leave this option at its default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">QtDragnDropWorkaround suppresses
the forwarding of unknown ClientEvent messages to windows --
usually this is harmless, but Qt has problems handling
unrecognised <br>
ClientEvent messages. Enabling this option might therefore
help for Qt applications using DragnDrop. This option is off
by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EWMHIconicStateWorkaround is
needed by EWMH compliant pagers or taskbars which represent
windows which are on a different desktops as iconified.
These pagers and taskbars <br>
use a version of the EWMH specification before version 1.2
(the current KDE 2 &amp; 3 versions). These pagers and
taskbars use the IconicState WM_STATE state to determine if
<br>
an application is iconified. This state, according to the
ICCCM, does not imply that a window is iconified (in the
usual sense). Turning on this option forces fvwm to <br>
establish an equivalence between the IconicState WM_STATE
state and the iconified window. This violates ICCCM
compliance but should not cause big problems. By default
<br>
this option is off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With the DisplayNewWindowNames
enabled, fvwm prints the name, icon name (if available),
resource and class of new windows to the console. This can
help in finding the <br>
correct strings to use in the Style command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the ExplainWindowPlacement
option is enabled, fvwm prints a message to the console
whenever a new window is placed or one of the commands
PlaceAgain, Recapture or <br>
RecaptureWindow is used. The message explains on which desk,
page, Xinerama screen and position it was placed and why.
This option can be used to figure out why a <br>
specific window does not appear where you think it
should.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The DebugCRMotionMethod option
enables some debugging code in the ConfigureRequest handling
routines of fvwm. It is not helpful for the user, but if you
report a bug to <br>
the fvwm team we may ask you to enable this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The TransliterateUtf8 option
enables transliteration during conversions from utf-8
strings. By default fvwm will not transliterate during
conversion, but will fall back <br>
to alternate strings provided by the clients if conversion
from utf-8 fails due to characters which have no direct
correspondance in the target charecter set. Some <br>
clients however neglect to set non utf-8 properties
correctly in which case this option may help.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BusyCursor [Option bool], ...
<br>
This command controls the cursor during the execution of
certain commands. Option can be DynamicMenu,
ModuleSynchronous, Read, Wait or *. An option must be
followed by a <br>
boolean argument bool. You can use commas to separate
individual options. If you set an option to
&quot;True&quot;, then when the corresponding command is
run, fvwm displays the <br>
cursor of the WAIT context of the CursorStyle command.
&quot;False&quot; forces to not display the cursor. The
default is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BusyCursor DynamicMenu False,
ModuleSynchronous False, Read False, Wait False</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The * option refers to all
available options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Read option controls the
PipeRead command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The DynamicMenu option affects
the DynamicPopupAction and MissingSubmenuFunction options of
the AddToMenu command. If this option is set to
&quot;False&quot;, then the busy cursor <br>
is not displayed during a dynamic menu command even if this
command is a Read or PipeRead command and the Read option is
set to &quot;True&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ModuleSynchronous option
affects the ModuleSynchronous command. If this option is set
to &quot;False&quot;, then the busy cursor is not displayed
while fvwm waits for a module <br>
started by ModuleSynchronous to complete its startup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Wait option affects only the
root cursor. During a wait pause the root cursor is replaced
by the busy cursor and fvwm is still fully functional (you
can escape from <br>
the pause, see the EscapeFunc command). If you want to use
this option and if you do not use the default root cursor,
you must set your root cursor with the CursorStyle <br>
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ClickTime [delay] <br>
Specifies the maximum delay in milliseconds between a button
press and a button release for the Function command to
consider the action a mouse click. The default delay <br>
is 150 milliseconds. Omitting the delay value resets the
ClickTime to the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ColorLimit limit <br>
This command is obsolete. See the --color-limit option to
fvwm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ColormapFocus FollowsMouse |
FollowsFocus <br>
By default, fvwm installs the colormap of the window that
the cursor is in. If you use</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ColormapFocus FollowsFocus</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">then the installed colormap is
the one for the window that currently has the keyboard
focus.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CursorStyle context [num | name
| None | Tiny | file [x y] [fg bg]] <br>
Defines a new cursor for the specified context. Note that
this command can not control the shapes an applications
uses, for example, to indicate that it is busy. The <br>
various contexts are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">POSITION (top_left_corner) <br>
used when initially placing windows</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TITLE (top_left_arrow) <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ROOT (left_ptr) <br>
used as the root cursor</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STROKE (plus) <br>
used during a StrokeFunc command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The defaults are shown in
parentheses above. If you ever want to restore the default
cursor for a specific context you can omit the second
argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The second argument is either
the numeric value of the cursor as defined in the include
file X11/cursorfont.h or its name (without the XC_ prefix).
Alternatively, the xpm <br>
file name may be specified. The name can also be None (no
cursor) or Tiny (a single pixel as the cursor).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># make the kill cursor be
XC_gumby (both forms work): <br>
CursorStyle DESTROY 56 <br>
CursorStyle DESTROY gumby</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alternatively, the cursor can be
loaded from an (XPM, PNG or SVG) image file. If fvwm is
compiled with Xcursor support, full ARGB is used, and
(possibly animated) cursor <br>
files made with the xcursorgen program can be loaded.
Otherwise the cursor is converted to monochrome.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The optional x and y arguments
(following a file argument) specifies the hot-spot

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The optional fg and bg arguments
specify the foreground and background colors for the cursor,
defaulting to black and white (reverse video compared to the
actual bitmap). <br>
These colors are only used with monochrome cursors.
Otherwise they are silently ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CursorStyle ROOT nice_arrow.xpm

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DefaultColors [foreground]
[background] <br>
DefaultColors sets the default foreground and background
colors used in miscellaneous windows created by fvwm, for
example in the geometry feedback windows during a move <br>
or resize operation. If you do not want to change one color
or the other, use - as its color name. To revert to the
built-in default colors omit both color names. Note <br>
that the default colors are not used in menus, window titles
or icon titles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DefaultColorset [num] <br>
DefaultColorset sets the colorset used by the windows
controlled by the DefaultColors command. To revert back to
the DefaultColors colors use</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DefaultColorset -1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or any variant of the
DefaultColors command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DefaultFont [fontname] <br>
DefaultFont sets the default font to font fontname. The
default font is used by fvwm whenever no other font has been
specified. To reset the default font to the built-in <br>
default, omit the argument. The default font is used for
menus, window titles, icon titles as well as the geometry
feedback windows during a move or resize operation. To <br>
override the default font in a specific context, use the
Style * Font, Style * IconFont, or MenuStyle commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DefaultIcon filename <br>
Sets the default icon which is used if a window has neither
an client-supplied icon nor an icon supplied via the Icon
option of the Style command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DefaultLayers bottom put top
<br>
Changes the layers that are used for the StaysOnBottom,
StaysPut, StaysOnTop Style options. Initially, the layers 2,
4 and 6 are used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Deschedule [command_id] <br>
Removes all commands that were scheduled with the id
command_id with the Schedule command from the list of
commands to be executed unless they were already executed.
If <br>
the command_id is omitted, the value of the variable
$[schedule.last] is used as the id.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Emulate Fvwm | Mwm | Win <br>
This command is a catch all for how miscellaneous things are
done by fvwm. Right now this command affects where the
move/resize feedback window appears and how window <br>
placement is aborted. To have more Mwm- or Win-like behavior
you can call Emulate with Mwm or Win as its argument. With
Mwm resize and move feedback windows are in the <br>
center of the screen, instead of the upper left corner. This
also affects how manual placement is aborted. See the
ManualPlacement description.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EscapeFunc <br>
By default the key sequence Ctrl-Alt-Escape allows for
escaping from a Wait pause and from a locked
ModuleSynchronous command. The EscapeFunc command used with
the Key <br>
command allows for configuring this key sequence. An
example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Key Escape A MC - <br>
Key Escape A S EscapeFunc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">replaces the Ctrl-Alt-Escape key
sequence with Shift-Escape for aborting a Wait pause and
ModuleSynchronous command. EscapeFunc used outside the Key
command does nothing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FakeClick [command value] ...
<br>
This command is mainly intended for debugging fvwm and no
guarantees are made that it works for you. FakeClick can
simulate mouse button press and release events and pass <br>
them to fvwm or the applications. The parameters are a list
of commands which consist of pairs of command tokens and
integer values, The press and release commands are <br>
followed by the appropriate mouse button number and generate
a button press or release event on the window below the
pointer. The wait commands pauses fvwm for the given <br>
number of milliseconds. The modifiers command simulates
pressing or releasing modifier keys. The values 1 to 5 are
mapped to Mod1 to Mod5 while 6, 7 and 8 are mapped to <br>
Shift , Lock and Control The modifier is set for any further
button events. To release a modifier key, use the
corresponding negative number. The depth command <br>
determines to which window the button events are sent. With
a depth of 1, all events go to the root window, regardless
of the pointer&rsquo;s position. With 2, the event is <br>
passed to the top level window under the pointer which is
usually the frame window. With 3, events go to the client
window. Higher numbers go to successive sub windows. <br>
Zero (0) goes to the smallest window that contains the
pointer. Note that events propagate upward.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FakeClick depth 2 press 1 wait

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This simulates a click with

abbreviated with their first letter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FakeKeypress [command value] ...
<br>
This command is mainly intended for debugging fvwm and no

<br>
name. The key name is a standard X11 key name as defined in
/usr/include/X11/keysymdef.h, (without the XK_ prefix), or
the keysym database /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/XKeysymDB. <br>
The wait, modifiers and depth commands are the same as those

<p style="margin-top: 1em">instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IconPath path <br>
This command is obsolete. Please use ImagePath instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ImagePath path <br>
Specifies a colon separated list of directories in which to
search for images (both monochrome and pixmap). To find an
image given by a relative pathname, fvwm looks into <br>
each directory listed in turn, and uses the first file
found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a directory is given in the
form &quot;/some/dir;.ext&quot;, this means all images in
this directory have the extension &quot;.ext&quot; that
should be forced. The original image name <br>
(that may contain another extension or no extension at all)
is not probed, instead &quot;.ext&quot; is added or replaces
the original extension. This is useful, for example, if a
<br>
user has some image directories with &quot;.xpm&quot; images
and other image directories with the same names, but
&quot;.png&quot; images.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The path may contain environment
variables such as $HOME (or ${HOME}). Further, a
&rsquo;+&rsquo; in the path is expanded to the previous
value of the path, allowing appending or <br>
prepending to the path easily.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ImagePath
$HOME/icons:+:/usr/include/X11/bitmaps</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: if the FvwmM4 module is
used to parse your config files, then m4 may want to mangle
the word &quot;include&quot; which frequently shows up in
the ImagePath command. To fix <br>
this one may add</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">undefine(&lsquo;include&rsquo;)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">prior to the ImagePath command,
or better: use the -m4-prefix option to force all m4
directives to have a prefix of &quot;m4_&quot; (see the
FvwmM4 man page).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LocalePath path <br>
Specifies a colon separated list of &quot;locale path&quot;
in which to search for string translations. A locale path is
constituted by a directory path and a text domain separated
<br>
by a semicolon (&rsquo;;&rsquo;). As an example the default
locale path is:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">/install_prefix/share/locale;fvwm</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where install_prefix is the fvwm
installation directory. With such a locale path translations
are searched for in</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">/install_prefix/share/locale/lang/LC_MESSAGES/fvwm.mo</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where lang depends on the
locale. If no directory is given the default directory path
is assumed. If no text domain is given, fvwm is assumed.
Without argument the <br>
default locale path is restored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As for the ImagePath command,
path may contain environment variables and a &rsquo;+&rsquo;
to append or prepend the locale path easily.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, the fvwm-themes
package uses</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LocalePath
&quot;;fvwm-themes:+&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">to add locale catalogs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default fvwm catalog
contains a few strings used by the fvwm executable itself
(Desk and Geometry) and strings used in some default
configuration files and FvwmForm <br>
configuration. You can take a look at the po/ subdirectory
of the fvwm source to get the list of the strings with a
possible translation in various languages. At <br>
present, very few languages are supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The main use of locale catalogs
is via the &quot;$[gt.string]&quot; parameter:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DestroyMenu MenuFvwmWindowOps
<br>
AddToMenu MenuFvwmWindowOps &quot;$[gt.Window Ops]&quot;
Title <br>
+ &quot;$[gt.&amp;Move]&quot; Move <br>

+ &quot;&quot; Nop <br>
+ &quot;$[gt.&amp;Close]&quot; Close <br>
+ &quot;$[gt.&amp;Destroy]&quot; Destroy</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gives a menu in the locale
languages if translations are available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the FvwmTaskBar module
has its own catalog and that the FvwmScript module has a set
of special instructions for string translation. It is out of
the scope of <br>
this discussion to explain how to build locale catalogs.
Please refer to the GNU gettext documentation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PixmapPath path <br>
This command is obsolete. Please use ImagePath instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PrintInfo subject [verbose] <br>
Print information on subject on stderr. An optional integer
argument verbose defines the level of information which is
given. The current valid subjects are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Colors which prints information
about the colors used by fvwm. This useful on screens which
can only display 256 (or less) colors at once. If verbose is
one or greater <br>
the palette used by fvwm is printed. If you have a limited
color palette, and you run out of colors, this command might
be helpful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ImageCache which prints
information about the images loaded by fvwm. If verbose is
one or greater all images in the cache will be listed
together with their respective <br>
reuse.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Locale which prints information
on your locale and the fonts that fvwm used. verbose can be
1 or 2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nls which prints information on
the locale catalogs that fvwm used</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">style which prints information
on fvwm styles. verbose can be 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bindings which prints
information on all the bindings fvwm has: key, mouse and
stroke bindings. verbose has no effect with this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">infostore which prints
information on all entries in the infostore, listing the key
and its value. verbose has no effect with this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Repeat <br>
When the Repeat command is invoked, the last command that
was executed by fvwm is executed again. This happens
regardless of whether it was triggered by user interaction,
<br>
a module or by an X event. Commands that are executed from a
function defined with the Function command, from the Read or
PipeRead commands or by a menu are not repeated. <br>
Instead, the function, menu or the Read or PipeRead command
is executed again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Schedule [Periodic] delay_ms
[command_id] command <br>
The command is executed after about delay_ms milliseconds.
This may be useful in some tricky setups. The command is
executed in the same context window as the Schedule <br>
command. An optional integer argument command_id may be
given in decimal, hexadecimal or octal format. This id can
be used with the Deschedule command to remove the <br>
scheduled command before it is executed. If no id is given,
fvwm uses negative id numbers, starting with -1 and
decreasing by one with each use of the Schedule command.
<br>
Note that the Schedule command and its arguments undergo the
usual command line expansion, and, when command is finally
executed, it is expanded again. It may therefore <br>
be necessary to quote the parts of the command that must not
be expanded twice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: A window&rsquo;s id as it
is returned with $[w.id] can be used as the command_id.
Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Current Schedule 1000 $[w.id]
WindowShade</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Schedule command also
supports the optional keyword Periodic which indicates that
the command should be executed every delay_ms. Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Schedule Periodic 10000 PipeRead
&rsquo;[ -N &quot;$MAIL&quot; ] &amp;&amp; echo Echo You
have mail&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use the Deschedule command to
stop periodic commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">State state [bool] <br>
Sets, clears or toggles one of the 32 user defined states
which are associated with each window. The state is a number
ranging from 0 to 31. The states have no meaning <br>
in fvwm, but they can be checked in conditional commands
like Next with the State condition. The optional argument
bool is a boolean argument. &quot;True&quot; sets the given
<br>
state, while &quot;False&quot; clears it. Using
&quot;toggle&quot; switches to the opposite state. If the
bool argument is not given, the state is toggled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WindowFont [fontname] <br>
This command is obsoleted by the Style option Font. Please
use</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Style * Font fontname</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WindowList [(conditions)]
[position] [options] [double-click-action] <br>
Generates a pop-up menu (and pops it up) in which the title
and geometry of each of the windows currently on the desktop
are shown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The format of the geometry part
is: desk(layer): x-geometry sticky, where desk and layer are
the corresponding numbers and sticky is empty or a capital
S. The geometry of <br>
iconified windows is shown in parentheses. Selecting an item
from the window list pop-up menu causes the interpreted
function &quot;WindowListFunc&quot; to be run with the
window <br>
id of that window passed in as $0. The default
&quot;WindowListFunc&quot; looks like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AddToFunc WindowListFunc <br>
+ I Iconify off <br>
+ I FlipFocus <br>
+ I Raise <br>
+ I WarpToWindow 5p 5p</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can destroy the built-in
&quot;WindowListFunc&quot; and create your own if these
defaults do not suit you.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The window list menu uses the
&quot;WindowList&quot; menu style if it is defined (see
MenuStyle command). Otherwise the default menu style is
used. To switch back to the default <br>
menu style, issue the command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DestroyMenuStyle WindowList</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MenuStyle WindowList
SelectOnRelease Meta_L</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The conditions can be used to
exclude certain windows from the window list. Please refer
to the Current command for details. Only windows that match
the given conditions <br>
are displayed in the window list. The options below work
vice versa: windows that would otherwise not be included in
the window list can be selected with them. The <br>
conditions always override the options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The position arguments are the
same as for Menu. The command double-click-action is invoked
if the user double-clicks (or hits the key rapidly twice if
the menu is bound <br>
to a key) when bringing the window list. The
double-click-action must be quoted if it consists of more
than one word.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The double-click-action is
useful to define a default window if you have bound the
window list to a key (or button) like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Here we call an existing
function, but <br>
# it may be different. See the default <br>
# WindowListFunc definition earlier in this <br>
# man page. <br>
AddToFunc SwitchToWindow <br>
+ I WindowListFunc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Key Tab A M WindowList
&quot;Prev SwitchToWindow&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hitting Alt-Tab once it brings
up the window list, if you hit it twice the focus is flipped
between the current and the last focused window. With the
proper <br>
SelectOnRelease menu style (see example above) a window is
selected as soon as you release the Alt key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The options passed to WindowList
are separated by commas and can be Geometry / NoGeometry /
NoGeometryWithInfo, NoDeskNum, NoLayer, NoNumInDeskTitle,
NoCurrentDeskTitle, <br>
MaxLabelWidth width, TitleForAllDesks, Function funcname,
Desk desknum, CurrentDesk, NoIcons / Icons / OnlyIcons,

NoOnBottom / OnBottom / OnlyOnBottom, Layer m [n],
UseSkipList / OnlySkipList, NoDeskSort, ReverseOrder,
CurrentAtEnd, IconifiedAtEnd, UseIconName, Alphabetic / <br>
NotAlphabetic, SortByResource, SortByClass, NoHotkeys,
SelectOnRelease.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(Note - normal means not iconic,
sticky, or on top)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With the SortByResource option
windows are alphabetically sorted first by resource class,
then by resource name and then by window name (or icon name
if UseIconName is <br>
specified). ReverseOrder also works in the expected
manner.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With the SortByClass option
windows are sorted just like with SortByResource, but the
resource name is not taken into account, only the resource
class.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The SelectOnRelease option works
exactly like the MenuStyle option with the same name, but
overrides the option given in a menu style. By default, this
option is set to <br>
the left Alt key. To switch it off, use SelectOnRelease
without a key name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you pass in a function via
Function funcname, it is called within a window context of
the selected window:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AddToFunc IFunc I Iconify toggle
<br>
WindowList Function IFunc, NoSticky, CurrentDesk,
NoIcons</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you use the Layer m [n]
option, only windows in layers between m and n are
displayed. n defaults to m. With the ReverseOrder option the
order of the windows in the <br>
list is reversed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With the CurrentAtEnd option the
currently focused window (if any) is shown at the bottom of
the list. This is mostly intended for simulating the Alt-Tab
behavior in <br>
another GUI.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IconifiedAtEnd makes iconified
windows be moved to the end of the list. This is also from
another GUI.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The NoGeometry option causes
fvwm to not display the geometries as well as the separators
which indicate the different desktops. NoGeometryWithInfo
removes the <br>
geometries, but keep the desktop information and indicates
iconic windows. NoDeskNum causes fvwm to not display the
desktop number in the geometry or before the window <br>
title with the NoGeometryWithInfo option. NoNumInDeskTitle
is only useful if a desktop name is defined with the
DesktopName command. It causes fvwm to not display the <br>
desktop number before the desktop name. By default, the
WindowList menu have a title which indicates the current
desk or the selected desktop if the Desk condition is <br>
used. The NoCurrentDeskTitle option removes this title.
TitleForAllDesks causes fvwm to add a menu title with the
desk name and/or number before each group of windows on <br>
the same desk. With NoLayer, the layer of the window is not
diplayed. The options ShowPage, ShowPageX and ShowPageY
enable displaying the page of the window rounded <br>
multiples of the display size. With ShowScreen, the
window&rsquo;s Xinerama screen number is displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The MaxLabelWidth option takes
the number of characters to print as its argument. No more
than that many characters of the window name are
visible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you wanted to use the
WindowList as an icon manager, you could invoke the
following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WindowList OnlyIcons, Sticky,
OnTop, Geometry</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(Note - the Only options

option which just causes WindowList to only consider the
windows with WindowListSkip <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">XSync <br>
When XSync is called, the X function with the same name is
used to send all pending X requests to the server. This
command is intended for debugging only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">XSynchronize [bool] <br>
The XSynchronize command controls whether X requests are
sent to the X server immediately or not. Normally, requests
are sent in larger batches to save unnecessary <br>
communication. To send requests immediately, use
&quot;True&quot; as the argument, to disable this use
&quot;False&quot; or to toggle between both methods use
&quot;Toggle&quot; or omit the bool <br>
argument. Fvwm defaults to synchronized requests when
started with the --debug option. This command is intended
for debugging only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+ <br>
Used to continue adding to the last specified decor,
function or menu. See the discussion for AddToDecor,
AddToFunc, and AddToMenu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Window Movement and Placement
<br>
AnimatedMove x y [Warp] <br>
Move a window in an animated fashion. Similar to Move
command. The options are the same, except they are required,
since it doesn&rsquo;t make sense to have a user move the
<br>
window interactively and animatedly. If the optional
argument Warp is specified the pointer is warped with the
window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HideGeometryWindow [Never | Move
| Resize] <br>
Hides the position or size window that is usually shown when
a window is moved or resized interactively. To switch it off
only for move or resize operations the optional <br>
parameters Move and Resize can be used respectively. To
switch both on again use the Never option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Layer [arg1 arg2] | [default]
<br>
Puts the current window in a new layer. If arg1 is non zero
then the next layer is the current layer number plus arg1.
If arg1 is zero then the new layer is arg2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As a special case, default puts
the window in its default layer, i.e. the layer it was
initially in. The same happens if no or invalid arguments
are specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Lower <br>
Allows the user to lower a window. Note that this lowers a
window only in its layer. To bring a window to the absolute
bottom, use</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AddToFunc lower-to-bottom <br>
+ I Layer 0 0 <br>
+ I Lower</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Move [[screen screen] [w | m]x[p
| w] ... [w | m]y[p | w] ... [Warp]] | [pointer] | [ewmhiwa]
<br>
Allows the user to move a window. If called from somewhere
in a window or its border, then that window is moved. If
called from the root window then the user is allowed <br>
to select the target window. By default, the EWMH working
area is honoured.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the literal option screen
followed by a screen argument is specified, the coordinates
are interpreted as relative to the given screen. The width
and height of the <br>
screen are used for the calculations instead of the display
dimensions. The screen as interpreted as in the MoveToScreen
command. If the optional argument Warp is <br>
specified the pointer is warped with the window. If the
single argument pointer is given, the top left corner of the
window is moved to the pointer position before <br>
starting the operation; this is mainly intended for internal
use by modules like FvwmPager. If the optional argument
ewmhiwa is given, then the window position will <br>
ignore the working area (such as ignoring any values set via
EwmhBaseStruts).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The operation can be aborted
with Escape or any mouse button not set to place the window.
By default mouse button 2 is set to cancel the move
operation. To change this <br>
you may use the Mouse command with special context
&rsquo;P&rsquo; for Placement.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The window condition
PlacedByButton can be used to check if a specific button was
pressed to place the window (see Current command).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the optional arguments x and
y are provided, then the window is moved immediately without
user interaction. Each argument can specify an absolute or
relative position <br>
from either the left/top or right/bottom of the screen. By
default, the numeric value given is interpreted as a
percentage of the screen width/height, but a trailing
&rsquo;p&rsquo; <br>
changes the interpretation to mean pixels, while a trailing
&rsquo;w&rsquo; means precent of the window width/height. To
move the window relative to its current position, add the
&rsquo;w&rsquo; <br>
(for &quot;window&quot;) prefix before the x and/or y value.
To move the window to a position relative to the current
location of the pointer, add the &rsquo;m&rsquo; (for
&quot;mouse&quot;) prefix. To <br>
leave either coordinate unchanged, &quot;keep&quot; can be
specified in place of x or y.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For advanced uses, the arguments
x and y can be used multiple times, but without the prefix
&rsquo;m&rsquo; or &rsquo;w&rsquo;. (See complex examples
below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Simple Examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Interactive move <br>
Mouse 1 T A Move <br>
# Move window to top left is at (10%,10%) <br>
Mouse 2 T A Move 10 10 <br>
# Move top left to (10pixels,10pixels) <br>
Mouse 3 T A Move 10p 10p</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">More complex examples (these can
be bound as actions to keystrokes, etc.; only the command is
shown, though):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Move window so bottom right is

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: In order to obtain moving
windows which do not snap to screen, with interactive move,
hold down Alt whilst moving the window to disable snap
attraction if it&rsquo;s <br>
defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See also the AnimatedMove
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MoveToDesk [prev | arg1 [arg2]
[min max]] <br>
Moves the selected window to another desktop. The arguments
are the same as for the GotoDesk command. Without any
arguments, the window is moved to the current desk. <br>
MoveToDesk is a replacement for the obsolete WindowsDesk
command, which can no longer be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MoveThreshold [pixels] <br>
When the user presses a mouse button upon an object fvwm
waits to see if the action is a click or a drag. If the
mouse moves by more than pixels pixels it is assumed to <br>
be a drag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Previous versions of fvwm
hardwired pixels to 3, which is now the default value. If
pixels is negative or omitted the default value (which might
be increased when <br>
16000x9000 pixel displays become affordable) is
restored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MoveToPage [options] [x[p | w]
y[p | w]] | [prev] <br>
Moves the selected window to another page (x,y). The upper
left page is (0,0), the upper right is (M,0), where M is one
less than the current number of horizontal pages <br>
specified in the DesktopSize command. Similarly the lower
left page is (0,N), and the lower right page is (M,N).
Negative page numbers refer to pages from the <br>
rightmost/lowest page. If x and y are not given, the window
is moved to the current page (a window that has the focus
but is off-screen can be retrieved with this). <br>
Moving windows to a page relative to the current page can be
achieved by adding a trailing &rsquo;p&rsquo; after any or
both numerical arguments. To move the window relative to its
<br>
current location, add a trailing &rsquo;w&rsquo;. To move a
window to the previous page use prev as the single
argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Windows are usually not moved
beyond desk boundaries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Possible options are wrapx and
wrapy to wrap around the x or y coordinate when the window
is moved beyond the border of the desktop. For example, with
wrapx, when the <br>
window moves past the right edge of the desktop, it
reappears on the left edge. The options nodesklimitx and
nodesklimity allow moving windows beyond the desk boundaries
<br>
in x and y direction (disabling the wrapx and wrapy
options).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Move window to page (2,3) <br>
MoveToPage 2 3</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Move window to lowest and
rightmost page <br>
MoveToPage -1 -1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Move window to last page
visited <br>
MoveToPage prev</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Move window two pages to the
right and one <br>
# page up, wrap at desk boundaries <br>
MoveToPage wrapx wrapy +2p -1p</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MoveToScreen [screen] <br>
Moves the selected window to another Xinerama screen. The
screen argument can be &rsquo;p&rsquo; for the primary
screen, &rsquo;c&rsquo; for the current screen (containing
the mouse pointer), <br>
&rsquo;w&rsquo; for the screen containing the center of +the
the context window, &rsquo;g&rsquo; for the global screen or
the screen number itself (counting from zero).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OpaqueMoveSize [percentage] <br>
Tells fvwm the maximum size window with which opaque window
movement should be used. The percentage is percent of the
total screen area (may be greater than 100). With</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OpaqueMoveSize 0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">all windows are moved using the
traditional rubber-band outline. With</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OpaqueMoveSize unlimited</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or if a negative percentage is
given all windows are moved as solid windows. The default
is</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OpaqueMoveSize 5</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">which allows small windows to be
moved in an opaque manner but large windows are moved as
rubber-bands. If percentage is omitted or invalid the
default value is set. To <br>
resize windows in an opaque manner you can use the
ResizeOpaque style. See the Style command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PlaceAgain [Anim] [Icon] <br>
Causes the current window&rsquo;s position to be re-computed
using the initial window placement logic. The window is
moved to where it would have been if it were a new window
<br>
that had just appeared. Most useful with Smart or Clever
(ReallySmart) placement. With the optional argument Anim an
animated move is used to place the window in its new <br>
position. With the additional option Icon, the icon is
placed again instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Raise <br>
Allows the user to raise a window. Note that this raises a
window only in its layer. To bring a window to the absolute
top, use</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AddToFunc raise-to-top <br>
+ I Layer 0 ontop <br>
+ I Raise</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where ontop is the highest layer
used in your setup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RaiseLower <br>
Alternately raises and lowers a window. The window is raised
if it is obscured by any window (except for its own
transients when RaiseTransient style is used; see the <br>
Style command) otherwise it is lowered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Resize [[frame] [direction dir]
[warptoborder automatic] [fixeddirection] [w]width[p | c |
wa | da] [w]height[p | c]] <br>
Allows for resizing a window. If called from somewhere in a
window or its border, then that window is resized. If called
from the root window then the user is allowed to <br>
select the target window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The operation can be aborted
with Escape or by pressing any mouse button (except button 1
which confirms it).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the optional arguments width
and height are provided, then the window is resized so that
its dimensions are width by height. The units of width and
height are <br>
percent-of-screen, unless a letter &rsquo;p&rsquo; is
appended to one or both coordinates, in which case the
location is specified in pixels. With a &rsquo;c&rsquo;
suffix the unit defined by <br>
the client application (hence the c) is used. With the
suffix &rsquo;wa&rsquo; the value is a percentage of the
width or height size of the EWMH working area, and with the
suffix <br>
&rsquo;da&rsquo; it is a percentage of the width or height
of the EWMH dynamic working area. So you can say</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Resize 80c 24c</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">to make a terminal window just
big enough for 80x24 characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the width or height is
prefixed with the letter &rsquo;w&rsquo; the size is not
taken as an absolute value but added to the current size of
the window. Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Enlarge window by one line
<br>
Resize keep w+1c</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Both, width and height can be
negative. In this case the new size is the screen size minus
the given value. If either value is &quot;keep&quot;, the
corresponding dimension of the <br>
window is left untouched. The new size is the size of the
client window, thus</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Resize 100 100</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">may make the window bigger than
the screen. To base the new size on the size of the whole
fvwm window, add the frame option after the command. The
options <br>
fixeddirection, direction and warptoborder are only used in
interactive move operations. With fixeddirection the same
border is moved even if the pointer moves past the <br>
opposite border. The direction option must be followed by a
direction name such as &quot;NorthWest&quot;,
&quot;South&quot; or &quot;East&quot; (you get the idea).
Resizing is started immediately, <br>
even if the pointer is not on a border. If the special
option automatic is given as a direction argument, then the
direction to resize is calculated based on the position <br>
of the pointer in the window. If the pointer is in the
middle of the window, then no direction is calculated. The
warptoborder option can be used to warp the pointer to <br>
the direction indicated. As with the automatic option for
direction, the border to warp to is calculated based on the
pointer&rsquo;s proximity to a given border. Also, if <br>
resizing is started by clicking on the window border, the
pointer is warped to the outer edge of the border.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AddToFunc ResizeSE I Resize
Direction SE <br>
Mouse 3 A M ResizeSE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Resize [bottomright | br x y]
<br>
An alternate syntax is used if the keyword bottomright or in
short br follows the command name. In this case, the
arguments x and y specify the desired position of the <br>
bottom right corner of the window. They are interpreted
exactly like the x and y arguments of the Move command.
Actually, any of the options accepted by the Move command
<br>
can be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ResizeMaximize
[resize-arguments] <br>
Combines the effects of Resize and Maximize in a single
command. When used on a maximized window, the window is
resized and is still in the maximized state afterwards. <br>
When used on an unmaximized window, the window is resized
and put into the maximized state afterwards. This is useful
if the user wants to resize the window temporarily <br>
and then return to the original geometry. The
resize-arguments are the same as for the Resize command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ResizeMove resize-arguments
move-arguments <br>
This command does the same as the Resize and Move commands,
but in a single call which is less visually disturbing. The
resize-arguments are exactly the same arguments as <br>
for the Resize command and the move-arguments are exactly
the same arguments as for the Move command except the
pointer option which is not supported by the ResizeMove <br>
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Move window to top left corner
and cover <br>
# most of the screen <br>
ResizeMove -10p -20p 0 0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Grow the focused window
towards the top of screen <br>
Current Resize keep w+$[w.y]p keep 0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: Fvwm may not be able to
parse the command properly if the option bottomright of the
Resize command is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ResizeMoveMaximize
resize-arguments move-arguments <br>
Combines the effects of ResizeMove and Maximize in a single
command. When used on a maximized window, the window is
resized and moved and is still in the maximized state <br>
afterwards. When used on an unmaximized window, the window
is resized and put into the maximized state afterwards. This
is useful if the user wants to resize the window <br>
temporarily and then return to the original geometry. The
resize-arguments and move-arguments are the same as for the
ResizeMove command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RestackTransients <br>
This command regroups the transients of a window close to it
in the stacking order as if the window had just been lowered
and then raised. The position of the window <br>
itself is not altered. Only windows that use either the
RaiseTransient or LowerTransient style are affected at all.
When RestackTransients is used on a transient window <br>
with the StackTransientParent style set, it is redirected to
the parent window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SetAnimation milliseconds-delay
[fractions-to-move-list] <br>
Sets the time between frames and the list of fractional
offsets to customize the animated moves of the AnimatedMove
command and the animation of menus (if the menu style <br>
is set to animated; see MenuStyle command). If the
fractions-to-move-list is omitted, only the time between
frames is altered. The fractions-to-move-list specifies how
<br>
far the window should be offset at each successive frame as
a fraction of the difference between the starting location
and the ending location. e.g.:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SetAnimation 10 -.01 0 .01 .03
.08 .18 .3 .45 .6 .75 .85 .90 .94 .97 .99 1.0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sets the delay between frames to
10 milliseconds, and sets the positions of the 16 frames of
the animation motion. Negative values are allowed, and in
particular can be <br>
used to make the motion appear more cartoonish, by briefly
moving slightly in the opposite direction of the main
motion. The above settings are the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SnapAttraction [proximity
[behaviour] [Screen]] <br>
The SnapAttraction command is obsolete. It has been replaced
by the Style command option SnapAttraction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SnapGrid [x-grid-size
y-grid-size] <br>
The SnapGrid command is obsolete. It has been replaced by
the Style command option SnapGrid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WindowsDesk arg1 [arg2] <br>
Moves the selected window to another desktop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command has been removed
and must be replaced by MoveToDesk, the arguments for which
are the same as for the GotoDesk command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Important <br>
You cannot simply change the name of the command: the syntax
has changed. If you used:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WindowsDesk n</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">to move a window to desk n, you
have to change it to:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MoveToDesk 0 n</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">XorPixmap [pixmap] <br>
Selects the pixmap with which bits are xor&rsquo;ed when
doing rubber-band window moving or resizing. This has a
better chance of making the rubber-band visible if XorValue
<br>
does not give good results. An example pixmap
resize.rainbow.xpm is provided with the icon distribution.
To turn the XorPixmap off again use the XorValue command or
omit <br>
the pixmap argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">XorValue [number] <br>
Changes the value with which bits are xor&rsquo;ed when
doing rubber-band window moving or resizing. Valid values
range from zero to the maximum value of an unsigned long
<br>
integer on your system. Setting this value is a
trial-and-error process. The default value 0 tries to find a
value that gives a good contrast to black and white. The
<br>
default value is used if the given number is omitted or
invalid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Focus &amp; Mouse Movement <br>
CursorMove horizontal[p] vertical[p] <br>
Moves the mouse pointer by horizontal pages in the X
direction and vertical pages in the Y direction. Either or
both entries may be negative. Both horizontal and <br>
vertical values are expressed in percent of pages, so</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CursorMove 100 100</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">means to move down and right by
one full page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CursorMove 50 25</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">means to move right half a page
and down a quarter of a page. Alternatively, the distance
can be specified in pixels by appending a &rsquo;p&rsquo; to
the horizontal and/or vertical <br>
specification. For example</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CursorMove -10p -10p</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">means move ten pixels up and ten
pixels left. The CursorMove function should not be called
from pop-up menus.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FlipFocus [NoWarp] <br>
Executes a Focus command as if the user had used the pointer
to select the window. This command alters the order of the
WindowList in the same way as clicking in a window <br>
to focus, i.e. the target window is removed from the
WindowList and placed at the start. This command is
recommended for use with the Direction command and in the
<br>
function invoked from WindowList.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Focus [NoWarp] <br>
Sets the keyboard focus to the selected window. If the
NoWarp argument is given, this is all it does. Otherwise it
also moves the viewport or window as needed to make <br>
the selected window visible. This command does not
automatically raise the window. Does not warp the pointer
into the selected window (see WarpToWindow function). Does
<br>
not de-iconify. This command does not alter the order of the
WindowList, it rotates the WindowList around so that the
target window is at the start.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the NoWarp argument is
given, Focus cannot transfer the keyboard focus to windows
on other desks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To raise and/or warp a pointer
to a window together with Focus or FlipFocus, use a
function, like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AddToFunc SelectWindow <br>
+ I Focus <br>
+ I Iconify false <br>
+ I Raise <br>
+ I WarpToWindow 50 8p</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WarpToWindow [!raise | raise]
x[p] y[p] <br>
Warps the cursor to the associated window and raises it
(unless the option !raise is present). The parameters x and
y default to percentage of window down and in from the <br>
upper left hand corner (or number of pixels down and in if
&rsquo;p&rsquo; is appended to the numbers). If a number is
negative the opposite edge is used and the direction
reversed. <br>
This command works also with windows that are not managed by
fvwm. In this case fvwm does not bring the window onto the
screen if it is not visible. For example it is <br>
possible to warp the pointer to the center of the root
window on screen 1:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WindowId root 1 WarpToWindow 50
50</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Window State <br>
Close <br>
If the window accepts the delete window protocol a message
is sent to the window asking it to gracefully remove itself.
If the window does not understand the delete <br>
window protocol then the window is destroyed as with the
Destroy command. Note: if the window accepts the delete
window protocol but does not close itself in response, <br>
the window is not deleted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Delete <br>
Sends a message to a window asking that it remove itself,
frequently causing the application to exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Destroy <br>
Destroys an application window, which usually causes the
application to crash and burn.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Iconify [bool] <br>
Iconifies a window if it is not already iconified or
de-iconifies it if it is already iconified. The optional
argument bool is a boolean argument. &quot;True&quot; means
only <br>
iconification is allowed, while &quot;False&quot; forces
de-iconification. Using &quot;toggle&quot; switches between
iconified and de-iconified states.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are a number of Style
options which influence the appearance and behavior of icons
(e.g. StickyIcon, NoIcon).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For backward compatibility, the
optional argument may also be a positive number instead of
&quot;True&quot;, or a negative number instead of
&quot;False&quot;. Note that this syntax is <br>
obsolete, and will be removed in the future.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Maximize [flags] [bool | forget]
[horizontal[p]] [vertical[p]] <br>
Without its optional arguments (or if the bool bit has the
value &quot;toggle&quot;) Maximize causes the window to
alternately switch from a full-screen size to its normal
size. To <br>
force a window into maximized (normal) state you can use a
&quot;True&quot; or &quot;False&quot; value for the bool
argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With just the parameter
&quot;forget&quot; a maximized window reverts back into
normal state but keeps its current maximized size. This can
be useful in conjunction with the <br>
commands ResizeMaximize and ResizeMoveMaximize. If the
window is not maximized, nothing happens.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With the optional arguments
horizontal and vertical, which are expressed as percentage
of a full screen, the user can control the new size of the
window. An optional <br>
suffix &rsquo;p&rsquo; can be used to indicate pixels
instead of percents of the screen size. If horizontal is
greater than 0 then the horizontal dimension of the window
is set to <br>
horizontal*screen_width/100. If the value is smaller than 0
the size is subtracted from the screen width, i.e. -25 is
the same as 75. If horizontal is &quot;grow&quot;, it is
<br>
maximized to curren available space until finding any
obstacle. The vertical resizing is similar. If both
horizontal and vertical values are &quot;grow&quot;, it
expands <br>
vertically first, then horizontally to find space. Instead
of the horizontal &quot;grow&quot; argument,
&quot;growleft&quot; or &quot;growright&quot; can be used
respectively &quot;growup&quot; and &quot;growdown&quot;.
<br>
The optional flags argument is a space separated list
containing the following key words: ewmhiwa,
growonwindowlayer, growonlayers and screen. ewmhiwa causes
fvwm to <br>
ignore the EWMH working area. growonwindowlayer causes the
various grow methods to ignore windows with a layer other
than the current layer of the window which is <br>
maximized. The growonlayers option must have two integer
arguments. The first one is the minimum layer and the second
one the maximum layer to use. Windows that are <br>
outside of this range of layers are ignored by the grow
methods. A negative value as the first or second argument
means to assume no minimum or maximum layer. screen <br>
must have an argument which specifies the Xinerama screen on
which to operate. It can be &rsquo;p&rsquo; for the primary
screen, &rsquo;c&rsquo; for the current screen (containing
the mouse <br>
pointer), &rsquo;g&rsquo; for the global screen or the
screen number itself (counting from zero). This option is
only useful with multiple Xinerama screens.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here are some examples. The
following adds a title-bar button to switch a window to the
full vertical size of the screen:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mouse 0 4 A Maximize 0 100</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following causes windows to
be stretched to the full width:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mouse 0 4 A Maximize 100 0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This makes a window that is half
the screen size in each direction:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mouse 0 4 A Maximize 50 50</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To expand a window horizontally
until any other window is found:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mouse 0 4 A Maximize 0 grow</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To expand a window until any
other window on the same or a higher layer is hit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mouse 0 4 A Maximize
growonlayers $[w.layer] -1 grow grow</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To expand a window but leave the
lower 60 pixels of the screen unoccupied:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mouse 0 4 A Maximize 100
-60p</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Values larger than 100 can be
used with caution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Recapture <br>
This command is obsolete and should not be used anymore.
Should you want to do something specific that you cannot do
without it, please report this to the fvwm-workers <br>
mailing list &lt;fvwm-workers@fvwm.org&gt;. This command may
be removed at some point in the future. Please read the note
at the end of the section Delayed Execution of <br>
Commands to learn about how to avoid the Recapture
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Causes fvwm to recapture all of
its windows. This ensures that the latest style parameters
are used. The recapture operation is visually
disturbing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since fvwm version 2.4 only a
very few Style options need a Recapture to take effect (e.g.
UseStyle).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RecaptureWindow <br>
This command is obsolete and should not be used anymore. See
Recapture For details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Causes fvwm to recapture the
chosen window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Refresh <br>
Causes all windows on the screen to redraw themselves. All
pending updates of all windows&rsquo; styles and looks are
applied immediately. E.g. if Style or TitleStyle commands
<br>
were issued inside a fvwm function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RefreshWindow <br>
Causes the chosen window to redraw itself. All pending
updates of the window&rsquo;s style and look are applied

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Stick [bool] <br>
If the bool argument is empty or &quot;toggle&quot;, the
Stick command makes a window sticky if it is not already
sticky, or non-sticky if it is already sticky. To make a
window <br>
sticky regardless of its current state the bool argument
must be &quot;True&quot;. To make it non-sticky use
&quot;False&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">StickAcrossPages [bool] <br>
Works like Stick but only sticks a window across pages, not
across desks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">StickAcrossDesks [bool] <br>
Works like Stick but only sticks a window across desks, not
across pages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WindowShade [bool] |
[[ShadeAgain] direction] <br>
Toggles the window shade feature for titled windows. Windows
in the shaded state only display a title-bar. If bool is not
given or &quot;toggle&quot;, the window shade state is <br>
toggled. If bool is &quot;True&quot;, the window is forced
to the shaded state. If bool is &quot;False&quot;, then the
window is forced to the non-shaded state. To force shading
in a <br>
certain direction, the direction argument can be used. Any
of the strings &quot;North&quot;, &quot;South&quot;,
&quot;West&quot;, &quot;East&quot;, &quot;NorthWest&quot;,
&quot;NorthEast&quot;, &quot;SouthWest&quot;,
&quot;SouthEast&quot; or &quot;Last&quot; <br>
can be given. The direction can be abbreviated with the
usual one or two letters &quot;N&quot;, &quot;NW&quot;, etc.
Using a direction on a window that was already shaded
unshades the <br>
window. To shade it in a different direction, use the
ShadeAgain option. The direction Last shades the window in
the direction it last was shaded. If the window has <br>
never been shaded before it is shaded as if no direction had
been given. Windows without titles can be shaded too. Please
refer also to the options WindowShadeSteps, <br>
WindowShadeShrinks, WindowShadeScrolls, WindowShadeLazy,
WindowShadeAlwaysLazy and WindowShadeBusy options of the
Style command. Examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Style * WindowShadeShrinks,
WindowShadeSteps 20, WindowShadeLazy <br>
Mouse 1 - S WindowShade North <br>
Mouse 1 [ S WindowShade West <br>
Mouse 1 ] S WindowShade E <br>
Mouse 1 _ S WindowShade S</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: When a window that has
been shaded with a direction argument changes the direction
of the window title (see TitleAtTop Style option), the
shading direction does not <br>
change. This may look very strange. Windows that were shaded
without a direction argument stay shaded in the direction of
the title bar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For backward compatibility, the
optional argument may also be 1 to signify &quot;on&quot;,
and 2 to signify &quot;off&quot;. Note that this syntax is
obsolete, and will be removed in the <br>
future.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WindowShadeAnimate [steps [p]]
<br>
This command is obsolete. Please use the WindowShadeSteps
option of the Style command instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mouse, Key &amp; Stroke Bindings
<br>
IgnoreModifiers [Modifiers] <br>
Tells fvwm which modifiers to ignore when matching Mouse or
Key bindings. IgnoreModifiers affects the ClickToFocus style
too. This command belongs into your config. If <br>
you issue it when your fvwm session is already up and
running the results are unpredictable. The should appear
before any applications or modules are started in your <br>
config file (e.g. with the Exec command).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Modifiers has the same syntax as
in the Mouse or Key bindings, with the addition of
&rsquo;L&rsquo; meaning the caps lock key. The default is
&quot;L&quot;. Modifiers can be omitted, meaning <br>
no modifiers are ignored. This command comes in handy if the
num-lock and scroll-lock keys interfere with your shortcuts.
With XFree86 &rsquo;2&rsquo; usually is the num-lock <br>
modifier and &rsquo;5&rsquo; refers to the scroll-lock key.
To turn all these pesky modifiers off you can use this
command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IgnoreModifiers L25</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the Modifiers argument is the
string &quot;default&quot;, fvwm reverts back to the default
value &quot;L&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Important <br>
This command creates a lot of extra network traffic,
depending on your CPU, network connection, the number of Key
or Mouse commands in your configuration file and the <br>
number of modifiers you want to ignore. If you do not have a
lightning fast machine or very few bindings you should not
ignore more than two modifiers. I.e. do not <br>
ignore scroll-lock if you have no problem with it. In the
FAQ you can find a better solution of this problem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EdgeCommand [direction
[Function]] <br>
Binds a specified fvwm command Function to an edge of the
screen. Direction may be one of &quot;North&quot;,
&quot;Top&quot;, &quot;West&quot;, &quot;Left&quot;,
&quot;South&quot;, &quot;Bottom&quot;, &quot;Right&quot; and
&quot;East&quot;. If <br>
Function is omitted the binding for this edge is removed. If
EdgeCommand is called without any arguments all edge
bindings are removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Function is executed when the
mouse pointer enters the invisible pan frames that surround
the visible screen. The binding works only if EdgeThickness

specified by EdgeScroll is disabled for this edge. It is
possible to bind a function only to some edges and <br>
use the other edges for scrolling. This command is intended
to raise or lower certain windows when the mouse pointer
enters an edge. FvwmAuto can be used get a delay <br>

raises FvwmButtons if the mouse pointer enters the top edge
of the screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normally, the invisible pan
frames are only on the screen edges that border virtual
pages. If a screen edge has a command bound to it, the pan

that edge.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EdgeLeaveCommand [direction
[Function]] <br>
Binds a specified fvwm command Function to an edge of the

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Key [(window)] Keyname Context
Modifiers Function <br>
Binds a keyboard key to a specified fvwm command, or removes
the binding if Function is &rsquo;-&rsquo;. The syntax is
the same as for a Mouse binding except that the mouse button
<br>
number is replaced with a Keyname. Normally, the key binding
is activated when the key is pressed. Keyname is a standard
X11 key name as defined in <br>
/usr/include/X11/keysymdef.h, (without the XK_ prefix), or
the keysym database /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/XKeysymDB. Only key
names that are generated with no modifier keys or <br>
with just the Shift key held are guaranteed to work. The
Context and Modifiers fields are defined as in the Mouse
binding. However, when you press a key the context <br>
window is the window that has the keyboard focus. That is
not necessarily the same as the window the pointer is over
(with SloppyFocus or ClickToFocus). Note that key <br>
bindings with the &rsquo;R&rsquo; (root window) context do
not work properly with SloppyFocus and ClickToFocus. If you
encounter problems, use the PointerKey command instead. If
you <br>
want to bind keys to a window with SloppyFocus or
ClickToFocus that are supposed to work when the pointer is
not over the window, fvwm assumes the pointer is over the
<br>
client window (i.e. you have to use the &rsquo;W&rsquo;
context).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The special context
&rsquo;M&rsquo; for menus can be used to (re)define the menu
controls. It be used alone or together with &rsquo;T&rsquo;,
&rsquo;S&rsquo;, &rsquo;I&rsquo;, &rsquo;[&rsquo;,
&rsquo;]&rsquo;, &rsquo;-&rsquo; and &rsquo;_&rsquo;. See
the Menu <br>
Bindings section for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following example binds the
built-in window list to pop up when Alt-Ctrl-Shift-F11 is
hit, no matter where the mouse pointer is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Key F11 A SCM WindowList</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Binding a key to a title-bar
button causes that button to appear. Please refer to the
Mouse command for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mouse [(window)] Button Context
Modifiers Function <br>
Defines a mouse binding, or removes the binding if Function
is &rsquo;-&rsquo;. Button is the mouse button number. If
Button is zero then any button performs the specified
function. <br>
Note that only mouse buttons 1 to 5 are fully supported by
X11. Any number above this works only partially. Complex
functions can not be used with these buttons and <br>
neither any operation that requires dragging the pointer
with the button held. This is due to limitations of X11. By
default, the highest allowed button number is 9.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Context describes where the
binding applies. Valid contexts are &rsquo;R&rsquo; for the
root window, &rsquo;W&rsquo; for an application window,
&rsquo;D&rsquo; for a desktop application (as kdesktop or
<br>
Nautilus desktop), &rsquo;T&rsquo; for a window title-bar,
&rsquo;S&rsquo; for a window side, top, or bottom bar,
&rsquo;[&rsquo;, &rsquo;]&rsquo;, &rsquo;-&rsquo; and
&rsquo;_&rsquo; for the left, right, top or bottom side
only, &rsquo;F&rsquo; for a <br>
window frame (the corners), &rsquo;&lt;&rsquo;,
&rsquo;^&rsquo;, &rsquo;&gt;&rsquo; and &rsquo;v&rsquo; for
the top left, top right, bottom right or bottom left corner,
&rsquo;I&rsquo; for an icon window, or &rsquo;0&rsquo;
through &rsquo;9&rsquo; for title-bar <br>
buttons, or any combination of these letters.
&rsquo;A&rsquo; is for any context. For instance, a context
of &quot;FST&quot; applies when the mouse is anywhere in a
window&rsquo;s border except the <br>
title-bar buttons. Only &rsquo;S&rsquo; and &rsquo;W&rsquo;
are valid for an undecorated window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The special context
&rsquo;M&rsquo; for menus can be used to (re)define the menu
controls. It can be used alone or together with
&rsquo;T&rsquo;, &rsquo;S&rsquo;, &rsquo;I&rsquo;,
&rsquo;[&rsquo;, &rsquo;]&rsquo;, &rsquo;-&rsquo; and
&rsquo;_&rsquo;. See the Menu <br>
Bindings section for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The special context
&rsquo;P&rsquo; controls what buttons that can be used to
place a window. When using this context no modifiers are
allowed (Modifiers must be N), no window is <br>
allowed, and the Function must be one of PlaceWindow,
PlaceWindowDrag, PlaceWindowInteractive, CancelPlacement,
CancelPlacementDrag, CancelPlacementInteractive or -.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PlaceWindow makes Button usable
for window placement, both for interactive and drag move.
CancelPlacement does the inverse. That is makes Button to
cancel move for both <br>
interactive and drag move. It may however not override how
new windows are resized after being placed. This is
controlled by the Emulate command. Also a window being <br>
dragged can always be placed by releasing the button hold
while dragging, regardless of if it is set to PlaceWindow or
not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PlaceWindowDrag and
PlaceWindowInteractive/CancelPlacementDrag and
CancelPlacementInteractive work as
PlaceWindow/CancelPlacement with the exception that they
only affect <br>
either windows dragged / placed interactively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- is equivalent to
CancelPlacement.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following example makes all
buttons but button 3 usable for interactive placement and
makes drag moves started by other buttons than one cancel if
button 1 is pressed <br>
before finishing the move:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mouse 0 P N PlaceWindow <br>
Mouse 3 P N CancelPlacement <br>
Mouse 1 P N CancelPlacementDrag</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, the binding applies
to all windows. You can specify that a binding only applies
to specific windows by specifying the window name in
brackets. The window <br>
name is a wildcard pattern specifying the class, resource or
name of the window you want the binding to apply to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following example shows how
the same key-binding can be used to perform different
functions depending on the window that is focused:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Key (rxvt) V A C Echo
ctrl-V-in-RXVT <br>
Key (*term) V A C Echo ctrl-V-in-Term <br>
Key (*vim) V A C -- <br>
Key V A C Echo ctrl-V-elsewhere</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A &rsquo;--&rsquo; action
indicates that the event should be propagated to the
specified window to handle. This is only a valid action for
window-specific bindings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This example shows how to
display the WindowList when Button 3 is pressed on an rxvt
window:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mouse (rxvt) 3 A A
WindowList</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that Fvwm actually
intercepts all events for a window-specific binding and (if
the focused window doesn&rsquo;t match any of the bindings)
sends a synthetic copy of the <br>
event to the window. This should be transparent to most
applications, however (for security reasons) some programs
ignore these synthetic events by default - xterm is one <br>
of them. To enable handling of these events, add the
following line to your ~/.Xdefaults file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">XTerm*allowSendEvents: true</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Modifiers is any combination of
&rsquo;N&rsquo; for no modifiers, &rsquo;C&rsquo; for
control, &rsquo;S&rsquo; for shift, &rsquo;M&rsquo; for
Meta, &rsquo;L&rsquo; for Caps-Lock or &rsquo;A&rsquo; for
any modifier. For example, a modifier of <br>
&quot;SM&quot; applies when both the Meta and Shift keys are
down. X11 modifiers mod1 through mod5 are represented as the
digits &rsquo;1&rsquo; through &rsquo;5&rsquo;. The modifier
&rsquo;L&rsquo; is ignored by <br>
default. To turn it on, use the IgnoreModifiers command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Function is one of fvwm&rsquo;s
commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The title-bar buttons are
numbered with odd numbered buttons on the left side of the
title-bar and even numbers on the right. Smaller-numbered
buttons are displayed <br>
toward the outside of the window while larger-numbered
buttons appear toward the middle of the window (0 is short
for 10). In summary, the buttons are numbered:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 3 5 7 9 0 8 6 4 2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The highest odd numbered button
which has an action bound to it determines the number of
buttons drawn on the left side of the title bar. The highest
even number <br>
determines the number of right side buttons which are drawn.
Actions can be bound to either mouse buttons or keyboard
keys.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PointerKey [(window)] Keyname
Context Modifiers Function <br>
This command works exactly like the Key command. The only
difference is that the binding operates on the window under
the pointer. Normal key bindings operate on the <br>
focused window instead. The PointerKey command can for
example be used to bind keys to the root window if you are
using SloppyFocus or ClickToFocus. However, some <br>
applications (xterm is one example) are unable to handle
this key anymore, even if the pointer is over the xterm
window. It is recommended to use the PointerKey command <br>
only for key combinations that are not needed in any
application window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Style * SloppyFocus <br>
PointerKey f1 a m Menu MainMenu</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Stroke [(window)] Sequence
Button Context Modifiers Function <br>
Binds a mouse stroke sequence to a specified fvwm command,
or removes the binding if Function is &rsquo;-&rsquo;. The
syntax is the same as for a Mouse binding except that
Sequence <br>
is inserted in front of the button number and a value of 0
for Button concerns the StrokeFunc command. The Context and
Modifiers fields are defined as in the Mouse <br>
binding. However, only the &rsquo;R&rsquo; Context really
works (if you want to use other contexts you need to use the
StrokeFunc below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Strokes sequences are defined in
a telephone grid like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 2 3</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4 5 6</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">7 8 9</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or in a numeric pad grid like
this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">7 8 9</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4 5 6</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 2 3</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The telephone grid is used by
default, to use the numeric pad grid you should begin the
sequence with a &rsquo;N&rsquo;. Note that a complex motion
may produce several different <br>
sequences (see the &quot;netscape&quot; example below to
handle such motion). Moreover, sequences are limited to 20
elements (with the present version of libstroke), however,
in <br>
practice it is preferable to use sequence with less than 12
elements.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Because of the default button
menu in fvwm, you may need to remove a mouse button binding
(using an empty action) before using the stroke</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mouse 3 R N</p>

Key x R N StrokeFunc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you press mouse button 3 and
Alt anywhere (respectively, press the key x when the cursor
is on the root window), then fvwm records the mouse motions
until the mouse <br>
button 3 (respectively, the x key) is released and then
check if the recorded sequence corresponds to a stroke
binding of the form</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;Stroke sequence 0 A M
action&quot; <br>
&quot;Stroke sequence 0 R N action&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the Context and
Modifiers are taken at the beginning of the execution of the
StrokeFunc command (so you can release the modifiers before
the end of the stroke <br>
recording in the case of a mouse binding and if you used,
say, a title-bar context the mouse motion can go through an
application window). The keys Escape and Delete <br>
allow you to abort the command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The StrokeFunc command has five
options: NotStayPressed, EchoSequence, DrawMotion, FeedBack
and StrokeWidth. These options are disabled by default.
EchoSequence causes <br>
fvwm to Echo the recorded stroke sequence. DrawMotion causes
fvwm to draw the mouse motion on the screen. FeedBack causes
fvwm to display during a fraction of second the <br>
cursor of the WAIT context of the CursorStyle command if the
recorded stroke sequence corresponds to a stroke binding.
StrokeWidth takes an integer argument, which must <br>
be &gt;= 0 and &lt;= 100 and which defines the width of the
line for the DrawMotion option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NotStayPressed works only if
StrokeFunc is used via a Mouse or a Key command. This option
removes the need to have a button or the key pressed during
the stroke, but you <br>
have to do a mouse click or press the Return or Space key to
finish the mouse motion recording (these keys also work
without the NotStayPressed option).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can use the StrokeFunc
&quot;alone&quot;. In this case it works as above with the
NotStayPressed option enabled. However, Modifiers, in
general, may not work as expected <br>
(i.e., in this case use &rsquo;A&rsquo; or &rsquo;N&rsquo;
as Modifiers in the stroke bindings).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that some computers do not
support key release events. If that is the case the
StrokeFunc used via a Key command works as if the
NotStayPressed option is enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Controlling Window Styles <br>
For readability, the commands in this section are not sorted
alphabetically. The description of the Style command can be
found at the end of this section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FocusStyle stylename options
<br>
works exactly like the Style command, but accepts only the
focus policy related styles beginning with &quot;FP&quot;.
The prefix can be removed, but at the cost of a little bit
of <br>
time. FocusStyle is meant to make the configuration file
more readable. Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FocusStyle * EnterToFocus,
!LeaveToUnfocus</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">is equivalent to</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Style * FPEnterToFocus,
!FPLeaveToUnfocus</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DestroyStyle style <br>
deletes the style named style. The changes take effect
immediately. Note that style is not a wild-carded search
string, but rather a case-sensitive string that should <br>
exactly match the original Style command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Destroying style &quot;*&quot;
can be done, but isn&rsquo;t really to be recommended. For
example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DestroyStyle Application*</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This removes all settings for
the style named &quot;Application*&quot;, NOT all styles
starting with &quot;Application&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DestroyWindowStyle <br>
deletes the styles set by the WindowStyle command on the
selected window. The changes take effect immediately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UpdateStyles <br>
All pending updates of all windows&rsquo; styles and looks
are applied immediately. E.g. if Style, WindowStyle or
TitleStyle commands were issued inside a fvwm function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Style stylename options ... <br>
The Style command is used to set attributes of a window to
values other than the default or to set the window manager
default styles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">stylename can be a
window&rsquo;s name, class, visible name, or resource
string. It may contain the wildcards &rsquo;*&rsquo; and
&rsquo;?&rsquo;, which are matched in the usual Unix
filename manner. <br>
Multiple style options in a single Style command are read
from left to right as if they were issued one after each
other in separate commands. A given style always <br>
overrides all conflicting styles that have been issued
earlier (or further left on the same style line).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: windows that have no name
(WM_NAME) are given a name of &quot;Untitled&quot;, and
windows that do not have a class (WM_CLASS, res_class) are
given class &quot;NoClass&quot; and those <br>
that do not have a resource (WM_CLASS, res_name) are given
resource &quot;NoResource&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a window has the resource
&quot;fvwmstyle&quot; set, the value of that resource is
used in addition to any window names when selecting the
style.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">options is a comma separated
list containing one or more of the following keywords. Each
group of style names is separated by slashes

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the above list some options
are listed as style-option/opposite-style-option. The
opposite-style-option for entries that have them describes
the fvwm default behavior <br>
and can be used if you want to change the fvwm default
behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Focus policy <br>
ClickToFocus instructs fvwm to give the focus to a window
when it is clicked in. The default MouseFocus (or its alias
FocusFollowsMouse) tells fvwm to give a <br>
window the focus as soon as the pointer enters the window,
and take it away when the pointer leaves the window.
SloppyFocus is similar, but doesn&rsquo;t give up the <br>
focus if the pointer leaves the window to pass over the root
window or a ClickToFocus window (unless you click on it,
that is), which makes it possible to move the <br>
mouse out of the way without losing focus. A window with the
style NeverFocus never receives the focus. This is useful
for modules like FvwmButtons. for example. <br>
Note: Once any of the &quot;FP...&quot; styles has been
used, the defaults that come with the basic focus policies
are not restored when the latter are used again. For <br>
example, once !FPGrabFocus has been used, using ClickToFocus
does not restore FPGrabFocus.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The focus model can be augmented
with several additional options. In fvwm-2.5.3 and later,
there are a large number of advanced options beginning with
&quot;FP&quot; or <br>
&quot;!FP&quot;. These options shall replace the older
options one day and are described first. Using any of these
new options may limit compatibility with older releases.
<br>
In general, options beginning with &quot;FP&quot; turn a
feature on, while those beginning with &quot;!FP&quot; turn
it off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Focusing the window <br>
With FPEnterToFocus, when the pointer enters a window it
receives focus.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With FPLeaveToUnfocus a window
loses focus when the pointer leaves it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With FPClickToFocus,
FPClickDecorToFocus or FPClickIconToFocus, a window receives
focus when the inside of the window or the decorations or
its icon is clicked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The FPFocusByProgram style
allows windows to take the focus themselves.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The !FPFocusByFunction style
forbids that a window receives the focus via the Focus and
FlipFocus commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The FPFocusByFunctionWarpPointer
style controls if the pointer is warped to a selected window
when the Focus command is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FPLenient allows focus on
windows that do not want it, like FvwmPager or xclock.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The FPFocusClickButtons style
takes a list of mouse buttons that can be clicked to focus
or raise a window when the appropriate style is used. The
default is to <br>
use the first three buttons (&quot;123&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The FPFocusClickModifiers style
takes a list of modifier keys just like the Key command. The
exact combination of modifier keys must be pressed for the
click to <br>
focus or raise a window to work. The default is to use no
modifiers (&quot;N&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With the FPPassFocusClick style,
the click that was used to focus a window is passed to the
application.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With the
FPAllowFocusClickFunction style, the click that was used to
focus a window can also trigger a normal action that was
bound to the window with the Mouse <br>
command).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the FPIgnoreFocusClickMotion
style is used, clicking in a window and then dragging the
pointer with the button held down does not count as the
click to focus the <br>
window. Instead, the application processes these events
normally. This is useful to select text in a terminal window
with the mouse without raising the window. <br>
However, mouse bindings on the client window are not
guaranteed to work anymore (see Mouse command). This style
forces the initial click to be passed to the <br>
application. The distance that the pointer must be moved to
trigger this is controlled by the MoveThreshold command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The FPSortWindowlistByFocus and
!FPSortWindowlistByFocus styles control whether the internal
window list is sorted in the order the windows were focused
or in the <br>
order they were created. The latter is the default for
ClickToFocus and SloppyFocus.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Clicking the window to raise</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The styles FPClickRaisesFocused,
FPClickDecorRaisesFocused and FPClickIconRaisesFocused allow
to raise the window when the interior or the decorations or
the icon <br>
of the window is clicked while the window is already
focused.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The styles
FPClickRaisesUnfocused, FPClickDecorRaisesUnfocused and
FPClickIconRaisesUnfocused allow to raise the window when
the interior or the decorations or the <br>
icon of the window is clicked while the window is not yet
focused.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With the FPPassRaiseClick style,
the click that was used to raise the window is passed to the
application.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With the
FPAllowRaiseClickFunction style, the click that was used to
raise the window can also trigger a normal action that was
bound to the window with the Mouse <br>
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the FPIgnoreRaiseClickMotion
style is used, clicking in a window and then dragging the
pointer with the button held down does not count as the
click to raise the <br>
window. Instead, the application processes these events
normally. This is useful to select text in a terminal window
with the mouse without raising the window. <br>
However, mouse bindings on the client window are not
guaranteed to work anymore (see Mouse command. Note that
this style forces that the initial click is passed to <br>
the application. The distance that the pointer must be moved
to trigger this is controlled by the MoveThreshold
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Grabbing the focus when a new
window is created</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">New normal or transient windows
with the FPGrabFocus or FPGrabFocusTransient style
automatically receive the focus when they are created.
FPGrabFocus is the <br>
default for windows with the ClickToFocus style. Note that
even if these styles are disabled, the application may take
the focus itself. Fvwm can not prevent <br>
this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The OverrideGrabFocus style
instructs fvwm to never take away the focus from such a
window via the GrabFocus or GrabFocusTransient styles. This
can be useful if <br>
you like to have transient windows receive the focus
immediately, for example in a web browser, but not while you
are working in a terminal window or a text <br>
processor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The above three styles are
accompanied by FPReleaseFocus, FPReleaseFocusTransient and
FPOverrideReleaseFocus. These control if the focus is
returned to another <br>
window when the window is closed. Otherwise no window or the
window under the pointer receives the focus.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ClickToFocusPassesClickOff and
ClickToFocusPassesClick controls whether a mouse click to
focus a window is sent to the application or not. Similarly,
<br>
ClickToFocusRaisesOff/MouseFocusClickRaisesOff and
ClickToFocusRaises/MouseFocusClickRaises control if the
window is raised (but depending on the focus model).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: in fvwm versions prior to
2.5.3, the &quot;Click...&quot; options applied only to
windows with ClickToFocus while the &quot;Mouse...&quot;
options applied to windows with a <br>
different focus policy. This is no longer the case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The old GrabFocus style is
equivalent to using FPGrabFocus + FPReleaseFocus.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The old GrabFocusTransient style
is equivalent to using FPGrabFocusTransient +
FPReleaseFocusTransient.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Lenience is equivalent to the
new style FPLenient.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Window title <br>
The Title and !Title options determine if the window has a
title-bar or not. By default all windows have a title-bar.
NoTitle is equivalent to !Title but is <br>
deprecated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Windows with the TitleAtBottom,
TitleAtLeft or TitleAtRight style have a title-bar below, to
the left or to the right of the window instead of above as
usual. The <br>
TitleAtTop style restores the default placement. Even if the
window has the !Title style set, this affects the
WindowShade command. Please check the WindowShade <br>
command for interactions between that command and these
styles. Titles on the left or right side of the windows are
augmented by the following styles:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normally, the text in titles on
the left side of a window is rotated counterclockwise by 90
degrees from the normal upright position and 90 degrees
clockwise for <br>
titles on the right side. It can also be rotated in the
opposite directions with LeftTitleRotatedCW if TitleAtLeft
is used, and with RightTitleRotatedCCW if <br>
TitleAtRight is used. The defaults can be restored with
LeftTitleRotatedCCW and RightTitleRotatedCW. A normal
horizontal text may be rotated as well with <br>
TopTitleRotated if TitleAtTop is used, and with
BottomTitleRotated if TitleAtBottom is used. The defaults
can be restored with TopTitleNotRotated and <br>
BottomTitleNotRotated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default the title bar
decoration defined using the TitleStyle command is rotated
following the title text rotation (see the previous
paragraph). This can be <br>
disabled by using the !UseTitleDecorRotation style.
UseTitleDecorRotation reverts back to the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With the StippledTitle style,
titles are drawn with the same effect that is usually
reserved for windows with the Sticky, StickyAcrossPages or
StickyAcrossDesks <br>
style. !StippledTitle reverts back to normal titles.
StippledTitleOff is equivalent to !StippledTitle but is
deprecated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Color takes two arguments. The
first is the window-label text color and the second is the
window decorations normal background color. The two colors
are separated <br>
with a slash. If the use of a slash causes problems then the
separate ForeColor and BackColor options can be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Colorset takes the colorset
number as its sole argument and overrides the colors set by
Color. Instead, the corresponding colors from the given
colorset are used. <br>
Note that all other features of a colorset are not used. Use
the Colorset decoration style in the TitleStyle and
ButtonStyle command for that. To stop using the <br>
colorset, the colorset number is omitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The HilightFore, HilightBack and
HilightColorset style options work exactly like ForeColor,
BackColor and Colorset but are used only if the window has
the focus. <br>
These styles replace the old commands HilightColor and
HilightColorset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BorderColorset takes the
colorset number as its sole argument and overrides the
colors set by Color or Colorset. for the window border. To
stop using a colorset, <br>
the argument is omitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The HilightBorderColorset style
option works similarly to BorderColorset but is used when
the window has the focus.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">!IconTitle disables displaying
icon labels while the opposite style IconTitle enables icon
labels (default behaviour). NoIconTitle is equivalent to
!IconTitle but <br>
is deprecated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IconTitleColorset takes the
colorset number as its sole argument and overrides the
colors set by Color or Colorset. To stop using this
colorset, the argument is <br>
omitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HilightIconTitleColorset takes
the colorset number as its sole argument and overrides the
colors set by HilightColor or HilightColorset. To stop using
this <br>
colorset, the argument is omitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IconBackgroundColorset takes the
colorset number as its sole argument and uses it to set a
background for the icon picture. By default the icon picture
is not <br>
drawn onto a background image. To restore the default, the
argument is omitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IconTitleRelief takes one
numeric argument that may be between -50 and +50 pixels and
defines the thickness of the 3D relief drawn around the icon
title. With <br>
negative values the icon title gets a pressed in look. The
default is 2 and it is restored if the argument is
omitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IconBackgroundRelief takes one
numeric argument that may be between -50 and +50 pixels and
defines the thickness of the 3D relief drawn around the icon
picture <br>
background (if any). With negative values the icon
background gets a pressed in look. The default is 2 and it
is restored if the argument is omitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IconBackgroundPadding takes one
numeric argument that may be between 0 and 50 pixels and
defines the amount of free space between the relief of the
icon background <br>
picture (if any) and the icon picture. The default is 2 and
it is restored if the argument is omitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Font and IconFont options
take the name of a font as their sole argument. This font is
used in the window or icon title. By default the font given
in the <br>
DefaultFont command is used. To revert back to the default,
use the style without the name argument. These styles
replace the older WindowFont and IconFont <br>
commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The deprecated IndexedWindowName
style causes fvwm to use window titles in the form</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">name (i)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where name is the exact window
name and i is an integer which represents the i th window
with name as window name. This has been replaced with:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TitleFormat %n (%t)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ExactWindowName restores the
default which is to use the exact window name. Deprecated in
favour of:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TitleFormat %n</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IndexedIconName and
ExactIconName work the same as IndexedWindowName and
ExactWindowName styles but for the icon titles. Both are
deprecated in favour of:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IconTitleFormat %n (%t) <br>
IconTitleFormat %n</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TitleFormat describes what the
visible name of a window should look like, with the
following placeholders being valid:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%n <br>
Insert the window&rsquo;s name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%i <br>
Insert the window&rsquo;s icon name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%c <br>
Insert the window&rsquo;s class name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%r <br>
Insert the window&rsquo;s resource name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%t <br>
Insert the window count.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%I <br>
Insert the window ID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%% <br>
Insert a literal &rsquo;%&rsquo; character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any amount of whitespace may be
used, along with other characters to make up the string --
but a valid TitleFormat string must contain at least one of
the <br>
placeholders mentioned. No quote stripping is performed on
the string, so for example the following is printed
verbatim:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TitleFormat &quot; %n &quot;
-&gt; [%t] -&gt; [%c]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: It&rsquo;s perfectly
possible to use a TitleFormat which can result in wiping out
the visible title altogether. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TitleFormat %z</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Simply because the placeholder
&rsquo;%z&rsquo; isn&rsquo;t supported. This is not a bug
but rather a facet of how the formatting parser works.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IconTitleFormat describes what
the visible icon name of a window should look like, with the
options being the same as TitleFormat.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Title buttons <br>
Button and !Button take a numeric argument which is the
number of the title-bar button which is to be shown or
omitted. NoButton is equivalent to !Button but is <br>
deprecated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MwmButtons makes the Maximize
button look pressed-in when the window is maximized. See the
MwmDecorMax flag in ButtonStyle for more information. To
switch this <br>
style off again, use the FvwmButtons style.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Borders <br>
!Borders suppresses the window border (but not the title)
completely. The Borders style enables them again. Without
borders, all other styles affecting window <br>
borders are meaningless.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MwmBorder makes the 3D bevel
more closely match Mwm&rsquo;s. FvwmBorder turns off the
previous option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With the !Handles style, the
window does not get the handles in the window corners that
are commonly used to resize it. With !Handles, the width
from the <br>
BorderWidth style is used. By default, or if Handles is
specified, the width from the HandleWidth style is used.
NoHandles is equivalent to !Handles but is <br>
deprecated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HandleWidth takes a numeric
argument which is the width of the border to place the
window if it does have resize-handles. Using HandleWidth
without an argument <br>
restores the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BorderWidth takes a numeric
argument which is the width of the border to place the
window if it does not have resize-handles. It is used only
if the !Handles style <br>
is specified too. Using BorderWidth without an argument
restores the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DepressableBorder makes the
border parts of the window decoration look sunken in when a
button is pressed over them. This can be disabled again with
the FirmBorder <br>
style.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Icons, shading, maximizing,
movement, resizing <br>
Icon takes an (optional) unquoted string argument which is
the icon bitmap or pixmap to use. Icons specified this way
override pixmap icons, but not icon windows <br>
or the ewmh icon, provided by the client in the application
(with the WM_HINTS property or with the ewmh _NET_WM_ICON
property). The IconOverride style changes the <br>
behavior to override any client-provided icons; the
NoIconOverride style changes the behavior to not override
any client-provided icons; the default overriding <br>
behavior can be activated with the NoActiveIconOverride
style. With this style, fvwm uses application provided icons
if the icon is changed but uses the icon <br>
provided in the configuration file until then.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is one exception to these
rules, namely</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Style * Icon unknown.xpm</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">doesn&rsquo;t force the
unknown.xpm icon on every window, it just sets the default
icon like the DefaultIcon command. If you really want all
windows to have the same <br>
icon, you can use</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Style ** Icon unknown.xpm</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the NoIcon attribute is set
then the specified window simply disappears when it is
iconified. The window can be recovered through the
window-list. If Icon is <br>
set without an argument then the NoIcon attribute is cleared
but no icon is specified. An example which allows only the
FvwmPager module icon to exist:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Style * NoIcon <br>
Style FvwmPager Icon</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IconBox takes no argument, four
numeric arguments (plus optionally a screen specification),
an X11 geometry string or the string &quot;none&quot;:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IconBox [screen scr-spec] l t r
b</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IconBox geometry</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Where l is the left coordinate,
t is the top, r is right and b is bottom. Negative
coordinates indicate distance from the right or bottom of
the screen. If the <br>
first argument is the word screen, the scr-spec argument
specifies the Xinerama screen on which the IconBox is
defined. It can be the usual screen Xinerama <br>
specification, &rsquo;p&rsquo;, &Acirc;&acute;c&rsquo;,
&rsquo;g&rsquo;, a screen number or the additional
&rsquo;w&rsquo; for the screen where the window center is
located. This is only useful with multiple Xinerama <br>
screens. The &quot;l t r b&quot; specification is more
flexible than an X11 geometry. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IconBox -80 240 -1 -1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">defines a box that is 80 pixels
wide from the right edge, 240 pixels down from the top, and
continues to the bottom of the screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perhaps it is easier to use is
an X11 geometry string though:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IconBox 1000x70-1-1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">places an 1000 by 70 pixel icon
box on the bottom of the screen starting in the lower right
hand corner of the screen. One way to figure out a geometry
like this <br>
is to use a window that resizes in pixel increments, for
example, xv. Then resize and place the xv window where you
want the iconbox. Then use FvwmIdent to read <br>
the windows geometry. The icon box is a region of the screen
where fvwm attempts to put icons for any matching window, as
long as they do not overlap other icons. <br>
Multiple icon boxes can be defined as overflow areas. When
the first icon box is full, the second one is filled. All
the icon boxes for one style must be defined <br>
in one Style command. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Style * IconBox -80 240 -1 -1,
IconBox 1000x70-1-1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A Style command with the IconBox
option replaces any icon box defined previously by another
Style command for the same style. Thats why the backslash in
the <br>
previous example is required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: The geometry for the icon
box command takes the additional screen specifier
&quot;@w&quot; in case a Xinerama setup is used. This
designates the screen where the <br>
window center is located. The additional screen specifier is
not allowed anywhere else.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you never define an icon box,
or you fill all the icon boxes, fvwm has a default icon box
that covers the screen, it fills top to bottom, then left to
right, and <br>
has an 80x80 pixel grid. To disable all but the default icon
box you can use IconBox without arguments in a separate
Style command. To disable all icon boxes <br>
including the default icon box, the argument
&quot;none&quot; can be specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hint: You can auto arrange your
icons in the icon box with a simple fvwm function. Put the
&quot;DeiconifyAndRearrange&quot; function below in your
configuration file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AddToFunc DeiconifyAndRearrange
<br>
+ C Iconify off <br>
+ C All (CurrentPage, Iconic) PlaceAgain Icon</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">And then replace all places
where you call the Iconify command to de-iconify an icon
with a call to the new function. For example replace</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AddToFunc IconFunc <br>
+ C Iconify off <br>
+ M Raise <br>
+ M Move <br>
+ D Iconify off</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mouse 1 I A Iconify off</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">with</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AddToFunc IconFunc <br>
+ C DeiconifyAndRearrange <br>
+ M Raise <br>
+ M Move <br>
+ D DeiconifyAndRearrange</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mouse 1 I A
DeiconifyAndRearrange</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IconGrid takes 2 numeric
arguments greater than zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IconGrid x y</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Icons are placed in an icon box
by stepping through the icon box using the x and y values
for the icon grid, looking for a free space. The default
grid is 3 by 3 <br>
pixels which gives a tightly packed appearance. To get a
more regular appearance use a grid larger than your largest
icon. Use the IconSize argument to clip or <br>
stretch an icon to a maximum size. An IconGrid definition
must follow the IconBox definition that it applies to:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Style * IconBox -80x240-1-1,
IconGrid 90 90</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IconFill takes 2 arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IconFill Bottom Right</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Icons are placed in an icon box
by stepping through the icon box using these arguments to
control the direction the box is filled in. By default the
direction is <br>
left to right, then top to bottom. This would be expressed
as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IconFill left top</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To fill an icon box in columns
instead of rows, specify the vertical direction (top or
bottom) first. The directions can be abbreviated or spelled
out as follows: <br>
&quot;t&quot;, &quot;top&quot;, &quot;b&quot;,
&quot;bot&quot;, &quot;bottom&quot;, &quot;l&quot;,
&quot;lft&quot;, &quot;left&quot;, &quot;r&quot;,
&quot;rgt&quot;, &quot;right&quot;. An IconFill definition
must follow the IconBox definition that it applies to:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Style * IconBox -80x240-1-1,
IconFill b r</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IconSize sets limits on the size
of an icon image. Both user-provided and
application-provided icon images are affected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IconSize [ width height [
maxwidth maxheight ] ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All arguments are measured in
pixels. When all four arguments are passed to IconSize,
width and height represent the minimum size of an icon, and
maxwidth and <br>
maxheight represent the maximum size of an icon. Icon images
that are smaller than the minimum size are padded. Icon
images that are bigger than the maximum size <br>
are clipped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If only two arguments are passed
to IconSize, width and height represent the absolute size of
an icon. Icons covered by this style are padded or clipped
to achieve <br>
the given size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no arguments are specified,
the default values are used for each dimension. This
effectively places no limits on the size of an icon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The value of &quot;-1&quot; can
be used in place of any of the arguments to specify the
default value for that dimension.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition to the numeric
arguments, 1 additional argument can be
&quot;Stretched&quot;, &quot;Adjusted&quot;, or
&quot;Shrunk&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that module provided icon
managers are not affected by this style.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MiniIcon specifies a pixmap to
use as the miniature icon for the window. This miniature
icon can be drawn in a title-bar button (see ButtonStyle),
and can be used by <br>
various fvwm modules (FvwmWinList, FvwmIconMan and
FvwmTaskBar). It takes the name of a pixmap as an
argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WindowShadeShrinks and
WindowShadeScrolls control if the contents of a window that
is being shaded with the WindowShade command are scrolled
(default) or if they stay in <br>
place. The shrinking mode is a bit faster</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The WindowShadeSteps option
selects the number of steps for animation when shading a
window with WindowShade. It takes one number as its
argument. If the number has a <br>
trailing &rsquo;p&rsquo; it sets the number of pixels to use
as the step size instead of a fixed number of steps. 0
disables the animation. This happens too if the argument is
<br>
omitted or invalid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The WindowShade command has two
modes of operation: busy and lazy shading. Busy shading can
be 50% slower than lazy shading, but the latter can look
strange under some <br>
conditions, for example, if the window borders, buttons or
the title are filled with a tiled pixmap. Also, the window
handles are not drawn in lazy mode and the border <br>
relief may only be drawn partially right before the window
reaches the shaded state or tight after leaves the unshaded
state. By default, fvwm uses lazy mode if there are <br>
no bad visual effects (not counting the window handles) and
busy mode otherwise. Use the WindowShadeAlwaysLazy or
WindowShadeBusy to force using the lazy or busy mode. <br>
The default setting is restored with WindowShadeLazy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ResizeOpaque instructs fvwm to
resize the corresponding windows with their contents visible
instead of using an outline. Since this causes the
application to redraw <br>
frequently it can be quite slow and make the window flicker
excessively, depending on the amount of graphics the
application redraws. The ResizeOutline style (default) <br>
negates the ResizeOpaque style. Many applications do not
like their windows being resized opaque, e.g. XEmacs,
Netscape or terminals with a pixmap background. If you do
<br>
not like the result, do not use the ResizeOpaque style for
these windows. To exempt certain windows from opaque
resizing you could use these lines in your configuration
<br>
file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Style * ResizeOpaque <br>
Style rxvt ResizeOutline <br>
Style emacs ResizeOutline</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sticky makes the window sticky,
i.e. it is always visible on each page and each desk. The
opposite style, Slippery reverts back to the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">StickyIcon makes the window
sticky when it&rsquo;s iconified. It de-iconifies on top the
active desktop. SlipperyIcon reverts back to the
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">StickyAcrossPages and
StickyAcrossPagesIcon work like Sticky and StickyIcon, but
stick the window only across pages, not desks while
StickyAcrossDesks and <br>
StickyAcrossDesksIcon works the other way round.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Windows that have been marked as
Sticky or StickyAcrossDesks or StickyAcrossPages will have
stipples drawn on the titlebar. This can be negated with the
<br>
!StickyStippledTitle style. The style StickyStippledTitle
puts back the stipples where that window has also been
marked as Sticky. Note that this is the default style <br>
for Sticky windows. Sticky icons will have stipples drawn on
the icon title. This can be disabled in the same way with
the !StickyStippledIconTitle style.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Windows with the StartIconic
style are shown as icons initially. Note that some
applications counteract that by deiconifying themselves. The
default is to not iconify <br>
windows and can be set with the StartNormal style.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">StickyIcon makes the window
sticky when it&rsquo;s iconified. It de-iconifies on top the
active desktop. SlipperyIcon reverts back to the
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">StickyIconPage works like
StickyIcon, but sticks the icon only across pages, not desks
while StickyIconDesk works the other way round.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">StippledIconTitle works like
StippledTitle in that it draws stipples on the titles of
icons but doesn&rsquo;t make the icon sticky.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IgnoreRestack makes fvwm ignore
attempts of clients to raise or lower their own windows. By
default, the opposite style, AllowRestack is active.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FixedPosition and
FixedUSPosition make fvwm ignore attempts of the user to
move the window. It is still possible to move the window by
resizing it. To allow the user to <br>
move windows, use the VariablePosition or VariableUSPosition
style.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FixedSize and FixedUSSize make
fvwm ignore attempts of the user to resize the window. To
allow the user to resize windows, use the VariableSize or
VariableUSSize style.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FixedPPosition and FixedPSize
make fvwm ignore attempts of the program to move or resize
its windows. To allow this kind of actions, use the
VariablePPosition or <br>
VariablePSize style. These styles may sometimes affect the
initial placement and dimensions of new windows (depending
on the application). If windows are created at <br>
strange places, try either the VariablePPosition or
!UsePPosition styles. The FixedPSize style may screw up
window dimensions for some applications. Do Not use this
<br>
style in this case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MoveByProgramMethod affects how
fvwm reacts to requests by the application to move its
windows. By default, fvwm tries to detect which method to
use, but it sometimes <br>
detects the wrong method. You may come across a window that
travels across the screen by a few pixels when the
application resizes it, moves to a screen border with the
<br>
frame decorations off screen, that remembers its position
for the next time it starts but appears in a slighly shifted
position, or that attepmts to become full screen but <br>
has the. Try out both options, UseGravity and IgnoreGravity
on the window (and that window only) and see if that helps.
By default, fvwm uses the AutoDetect method. <br>
Once the method was detected, it is never changed again. As
long as fvwm can not detect the proper method, it uses
IgnoreGravity. To force fvwm to retry the detection, <br>
use one of the other two options first and then use
AutoDetect again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: This option was introduced
to alleviate a problem with the ICCCM specification. The
ICCCM clearly states that the UseGravity option should be
used, but <br>
traditionally applications ignored this rule.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Closable enables the functions
Close, Delete and Destroy to be performed on the windows.
This is on by default. The opposite, !Closable, inhibits the
window to be <br>
closed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Iconifiable enables the function
Iconify to be performed on the windows. This is on by
default. The opposite, !Iconifiable, inhibits the window
from being iconified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Maximizable enables the function
Maximize to be performed on the windows. This is on by
default. The opposite, !Maximizable, inhibits the window
from being maximized.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AllowMaximizeFixedSize enables
the function Maximize to be performed on windows that are
not resizable, unless maximization has been disabled either
using the style <br>
!Maximizable or through WM hints. This is on by default. The
opposite, !AllowMaximizeFixedSize, inhibits all windows that
are not resizable from being maximized.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ResizeHintOverride instructs
fvwm to ignore the program supplied minimum and maximum size
as well as the resize step size (the character size in many
applications). This <br>
can be handy for broken applications that refuse to be
resized. Do not use it if you do not need it. The default
(opposite) style is NoResizeOverride.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MinWindowSize [ width [ p ]
height [ p ] ] Tells fvwm the minimum width and height of a
window. The values are the percentage of the total screen
area. If the letter &rsquo;p&rsquo; <br>
is appended to either of the values, the numbers are
interpreted as pixels. This command is useful for certain
versions of xemacs which freak out if their windows become
<br>
too small. If you omit he parameters or their values are
invalid, both limits are set to 0 pixels (which is the
default value).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MaxWindowSize [ width [ p ]
height [ p ] ] Tells fvwm the maximum width and height of a
window. The values are the percentage of the total screen
area. If the letter &rsquo;p&rsquo; <br>
is appended to either of the values, the numbers are
interpreted as pixels. This command is useful to force large
application windows to be fully visible. Neither height <br>
nor width may be less than 100 pixels. If you omit the
parameters or their values are invalid, both limits are set
to 32767 pixels (which is the default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With IconifyWindowGroups all
windows in the same window group are iconified and
deiconified at once when any window in the group is
(de)iconified. The default is <br>
IconifyWindowGroupsOff, which disables this behavior.
Although a number of applications use the window group hint,
it is rarely used in a proper way, so it is probably <br>
best to use IconifyWindowGroups only for selected
applications.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The option SnapAttraction
affects interactive window movement: If during an
interactive move the window or icon comes within proximity
pixels of another the window or <br>
icon, it is moved to make the borders adjoin. The default of
0 means that no snapping happens. Calling this command
without arguments turns off snap attraction and <br>
restores the default behavior. Please refer also to the
SnapGrid command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The second argument determined
is optional and may be set to one of the five following
values: With All both icons and windows snap to other
windows and other icons. <br>
SameType lets windows snap only to windows, and icons snap
only to icons. With Windows windows snap only to other
windows. Similarly with Icons icons snap only to other <br>
icons. With None no snapping takes place. This option can be
useful in conjunction with the following argument if you
only want to snap against the screen edges. The <br>
default behavior is All.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The third and last optional
argument may be set to one of the four following values:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; With Screen the
already snapping icons or windows, which is controlled by
the second argument, will snap now also to the screen
edges.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; ScreenWindows
snaps only windows to the screen edges.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; ScreenIcons
snaps only icons to the screen edges.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; ScreenAll snaps
windows and icons to the screen edges.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The option SnapGrid defines an
invisible grid on the screen. During an interactive move a
window or icon is positioned such that its location (top
left corner) is <br>
coincident with the nearest grid point. The default
x-grid-size and y-grid-size setting are both 1, which is
effectively no grid all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An interactive move with both
SnapGrid and SnapAttraction results in the window being
moved to be adjacent to the nearest window border (if within
snap proximity) or grid <br>
position. The window moves the shortest distance possible to
satisfy both SnapGrid and SnapAttraction. Note that the x
and y coordinates are not coupled. For example, a <br>
window may snap to another window on the x axis while
snapping to a grid point on the y axis. Using this style
without arguments reinstates the default settings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The styles EdgeMoveDelay and
EdgeResizeDelay tells how hard it should be to change the
desktop viewport by moving or resizing a window over the
edge of the screen. The <br>
parameter tells how many milliseconds the pointer must spend
on the screen edge before fvwm moves the viewport. The
command EdgeScroll determines how far the viewport is <br>
scrolled. If -1 is given as the delay, page flipping is
disabled completely. The defaults are no delay for moving
(0) and no flipping for resizing (-1). Using these <br>
styles without any argument restores the default settings.
Note that, with</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EdgeScroll 0 0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">it is still possible to move or
resize windows across the edge of the current screen. See
also EdgeThickness.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The option EdgeMoveResistance
makes it easier to place a window directly adjacent to the
screen&rsquo;s or xinerama screen&rsquo;s border. It takes
one or two parameters. The first <br>
parameter tells how many pixels over the edge of the screen
a window&rsquo;s edge must move before it actually moves
partially off the screen. The optional second parameter <br>
does the same as the first, but for individual Xinerama
screens. If omitted, the value of the first parameter is
assumed for this type of movement. Set the second <br>
parameter to 0 to zero to ignore individual xinerama screen
edges. Note that the center of the window being moved
determines the xinerama screen on which the window <br>
should be kept. Both values are 0 by default. To restore the
defaults, the option EdgeMoveResistance can be used without
any parameters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The option InitialMapCommand
allows for any valid fvwm command or function to run when
the window is initially mapped by fvwm. Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Style MyWindow StartsOnPage 0 0,
InitialMapCommand Iconify</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This would hence place the
window called MyWindow on page 0 0 for the current desk, and
immediately run the Iconify command on that window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that should
InitialMapCommand be used as a global option for all
windows, but there is a need that some windows should not
have this command applied, then an action <br>
of Nop can be used on those windows, as in the following
example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Style * InitialMapCommand
Iconify <br>
Style XTeddy InitialMapCommand Nop</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Window Manager placement <br>
Applications can place windows at a particular spot on the
screen either by window manager hints or a geometry
specification. When they do neither, then the window <br>
manager steps in to find a place for the window. Fvwm knows
several ways to deal with this situation. The default is
TileCascadePlacement.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PositionPlacement
[Center|UnderMouse|move-arguments] When used without an
argument, new windows are placed in the top left corner of
the display. With the argument <br>
Center, all new window appear at the center of the screen,
and with UnderMouse, windows are centered under the mouse
pointer where possible. If the window is unable to <br>
fit on the screen because the pointer is at the edge of the
screen, then the window is forced on-screen using this
option. If any other move-arguments are given, they are <br>
interpreted exactly as the Move command does (with the
exception that references to the current window position do
not work as the window has not been placed yet).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CascadePlacement automatically
place new windows in a cascading fashion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TileCascadePlacement
automatically places new windows in a smart location - a
location in which they do not overlap any other windows on
the screen. If no such position <br>
can be found CascadePlacement is used as a fall-back
method.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TileManualPlacement This is the
same as TileCascadePlacement, but uses ManualPlacement as
the fall-back method.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MinOverlapPlacement
automatically places new windows in a location in which the
overlapping area in pixels of other windows is minimized. By
default this placement policy <br>
tries to avoid overlapping icons and windows on higher
layers. This can be configured with the
MinOverlapPlacementPenalties style.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MinOverlapPercentPlacement is
similar to MinOverlapPlacement but tries to minimize the
overlapped percentages of other windows instead of the
overlapped area in pixels. <br>
This placement policy tries to avoid covering other windows
completely and tries even harder not to cover small windows.
This can be configured with the <br>
MinOverlapPlacementPenalties and
MinOverlapPercentPlacementPenalties styles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MinOverlapPlacementPenalties
takes at most 6 positive or null decimal arguments:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">normal ontop icon sticky below
strut</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if trailing arguments are
missing the default is used which is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 5 10 1 0.05 50</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To reset this style to the
default values, prefix it with a &rsquo;!&rsquo;. This style
configures the MinOverlapPlacement and
MinOverlapPercentPlacement placement policy. The <br>
normal factor affects normal windows, the ontop factor
affects windows with a greater layer than the window being
placed, the icon factor affects icons, the sticky factor
<br>
affects sticky windows, the below factor affects windows
with a smaller layer than the window being placed, the strut
factor affects the complement of the EWMH working <br>
area if the window being placed has the
EWMHPlacementUseWorkingArea style and windows with an EWMH
strut hint (i.e., a &quot;please do not cover me&quot; hint)
if the window being <br>
placed has the EWMHPlacementUseDynamicWorkingArea style.
These factors represent the amount of area that these types
of windows (or area) are counted as, when a new <br>
window is placed. For example, by default the area of ontop
windows is counted 5 times as much as normal windows. So
MinOverlapPlacement and MinOverlapPercentPlacement <br>
covers 5 times as much area of another window before it will
cover an ontop window. To treat ontop windows the same as
other windows, set this to 1. To really, really <br>
avoid putting windows under ontop windows, set this to a
high value, say 1000. This style affects the window already
mapped and not the window which is currently placed. <br>
There is one exception to this rule: in the case of the
window being placed has the EWMHPlacementUseWorkingArea
style the strut factor affects the placed window.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">MinOverlapPercentPlacementPenalties
takes at most 4 positive or null integer arguments:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cover_100 cover_95 cover_85
cover_75</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if trailing arguments are
missing the defaults are used which are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">12 6 4 1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To reset this style to the
default values, prefix it with a &rsquo;!&rsquo;. This style
affects the MinOverlapPercentPlacement placement policy and
is similar to the <br>
MinOverlapPlacementPenalties style. The cover_xx factor is
used when the window being placed covers at least xx percent
of the window. This factor is added to the factor <br>
determined by the MinOverlapPlacementPenalties style.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ManualPlacement (aka active
placement). The user is required to place every new window
manually. The window only shows as a rubber band until a
place is selected <br>
manually. The window is placed when a mouse button or any
key except Escape is pressed. Escape aborts manual placement
which places the window in the top left corner of <br>
the screen. If mouse button 2 is pressed during the initial
placement of a window (respectively Shift and mouse button 1
in case Mwm emulation has been enabled with the <br>
Emulate command), the user is asked to resize the window
too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is possible to define buttons
usable to place windows with the Move command and the
special context &rsquo;P&rsquo; for placement (see Move
command). However, you can&rsquo;t redefine <br>
the way to also resize the window other than the way it is
affected by the Emulate command. The button used for placing
the window can be checked with the PlacedByButton <br>
condition (see Current command).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Placement policy options and
window stacking <br>
!UsePPosition instructs fvwm to ignore the program specified
position (PPosition hint) when adding new windows. Using
PPosition is required for some applications, but if <br>
you do not have one of those it&rsquo;s a real headache.
Many programs set PPosition to something obnoxious like 0,0
(upper left corner). Note: !UsePPosition is equivalent to
<br>
the deprecated option !UsePPosition</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">!UseUSPosition works like
!UsePPosition but applies suppresses using the user
specified position indicated by the program (USPosition
hint). It is generally a bad thing <br>
to override the user&rsquo;s choice, but some applications
misuse the USPosition hint to force their windows to a
certain spot on the screen without the user&rsquo;s consent.
Note: <br>
!UseUSPosition is equivalent to the deprecated option
!USPosition</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NoUseTransientPPosition and
UseTransientPPosition work like !UsePPosition and
UsePPosition but apply only to transient windows. Note:
!UseTransientPPosition is equivalent <br>
to the deprecated option !TransientPPosition</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NoUseIconPosition instructs fvwm
to ignore the program specified icon position (IconPosition
hint) when iconifying the window. Note: !UseIconPosition is
equivalent to the <br>
deprecated option !IconPosition</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">StartsOnDesk takes a numeric
argument which is the desktop number on which the window
should be initially placed. Note that standard Xt programs
can also specify this via <br>
a resource (e.g. &quot;-xrm &rsquo;*Desk:
1&rsquo;&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">StartsOnPage takes 1, 2, or 3
numeric arguments. If one or three arguments are given, the
first (or only) argument is the desktop number. If three
arguments are given, <br>
the 2nd and 3rd arguments identify the x,y page position on
the virtual window. If two arguments are given, they specify
the page position, and indicate no desk <br>
preference. If only one argument is given, StartsOnPage
functions exactly like StartsOnDesk. For those standard Xt
programs which understand this usage, the starting <br>
desk/page can also be specified via a resource (e.g.,
&quot;-xrm &rsquo;*page: 1 0 2&rsquo;&quot;). StartsOnPage
in conjunction with SkipMapping is a useful technique when
you want to start an <br>
app on some other page and continue with what you were
doing, rather than waiting for it to appear.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">StartsOnScreen takes one
argument. It can be &rsquo;p&rsquo; for the primary screen,
&rsquo;c&rsquo; for the current screen (containing the mouse
pointer), &rsquo;g&rsquo; for the global screen or the <br>
screen number itself (counting from zero). A new window is
placed on the specified Xinerama screen. The default is to
place windows on the screen that contains the mouse <br>
pointer at the time the window is created. However, those
windows which are not placed by fvwm (i.e., those with a
USPosition hint from a user specified geometry) are <br>
normally placed in a position relative to the global screen.
The StartsOnScreen style is also useful to cause these
windows to be placed relative to a specific Xinerama <br>
screen. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Style * StartsOnScreen c</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Would cause all windows,
including those with their own geometry to be placed
relative to the current Xinerama screen rather than the
global screen. For those standard Xt <br>
programs which understand this usage, the starting desk/page
can also be specified via a resource (e.g., &quot;-xrm
&rsquo;*fvwmscreen: c&rsquo;&quot;).
(&rsquo;fvwmscreen&rsquo; was chosen because some <br>
applications already use &Acirc;&acute;.screen&rsquo; for
other purposes.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">StartsOnPageIncludesTransients
causes the StartsOnPage style to be applied even for
transient windows. This is not usually useful, since
transients are usually pop ups <br>
that you want to appear in your visible viewport; but
occasionally an application uses a transient for something
like a startup window that needs to be coerced into
place.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">ManualPlacementIgnoresStartsOnPage
suppresses StartsOnPage or StartsOnDesk placement in the
event that both ManualPlacement and SkipMapping are in
effect when a window is <br>
created. This prevents you from interactively placing a
window and then wondering where it disappeared to, because
it got placed on a different desk or page. <br>
ManualPlacementHonorsStartsOnPage allows this to happen
anyway. The option has no effect if SkipMapping is not in
effect, because fvwm switches to the proper desk/page to
<br>
perform interactive placement. The default is
ManualPlacementIgnoresStartsOnPage;
ManualPlacementHonorsStartsOnPage matches the way the old
StartsOnDesk style used to <br>
handle the situation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CaptureHonorsStartsOnPage causes
the initial capture (of an already existing window) at
startup to place the window according to the StartsOnPage
and StartsOnScreen desk, <br>
page and Xinerama screen specification.
CaptureIgnoresStartsOnPage causes fvwm to ignore these
settings (including StartsOnDesk) on initial capture. The
default is <br>
CaptureIgnoresStartsOnPage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RecaptureHonorsStartsOnPage
causes a window to be placed according to, or revert to, the
StartsOnPage and StartsOnScreen desk, page and Xinerama
screen specification on <br>
Restart or Recapture. RecaptureIgnoresStartsOnPage causes
fvwm to respect the current window position on Restart or
Recapture. The default is <br>
RecaptureIgnoresStartsOnPage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Layer accepts one optional
argument: a non-negative integer. This is the layer the
window is put in. If no argument is given, any previously
set value is deleted and the <br>
default layer is implied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">StaysOnTop puts the window in
the top layer. This layer can be changed by the command
DefaultLayers; the default is 6.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">StaysPut puts the window in the
put layer. This layer can be changed by the command
DefaultLayers; the default is 4.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">StaysOnBottom puts the window in
the bottom layer. This layer can be changed by the command
DefaultLayers; the default is 2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">StartsLowered instructs fvwm to
put the window initially at the bottom of its layer rather
than the default StartsRaised.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">StartShaded tells fvwm to shade
the window. An optional direction argument may be given,
which can be one of &quot;North&quot;, &quot;South&quot;,
&quot;West&quot;, &quot;East&quot;, &quot;NorthWest&quot;,
&quot;NorthEast&quot;, <br>
&quot;SouthWest&quot;, &quot;SouthEast&quot; or if no
direction is given, the default is to shade north.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SkipMapping tells fvwm not to
switch to the desk the window is on when it gets mapped
initially (useful with StartsOnDesk or StartsOnPage).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KeepWindowGroupsOnDesk makes new
windows that have the window group hint set appear on the
same desk as the other windows of the same group. Since this
behavior may be <br>
confusing, the default setting is ScatterWindowGroups. The
window group hint is ignored when placing windows in this
case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Transient windows <br>
DecorateTransient causes transient windows, which are
normally left undecorated, to be given the usual fvwm
decorations (title bar, buttons, etc.). Note that some
pop-up <br>
windows, such as the xterm menus, are not managed by the
window manager and still do not receive decorations.
NakedTransient (the default) causes transient windows not to
<br>
be given the standard decorations. You can only bind keys or
mouse buttons to the sides and the client part of an
undecorated window (&rsquo;S&rsquo; and
&Acirc;&acute;W&rsquo; contexts in bindings, <br>
see Mouse and Key commands).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A window with the RaiseTransient
style that has transient windows raises all its transients
when it is raised. The DontRaiseTransient style disables
this behavior. All <br>
windows are then treated as if they had no transients.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A window with the LowerTransient
style that has transient windows lowers all its transients
when it is lowered. The DontLowerTransient style disables
this behavior. All <br>
windows are then treated as if they had no transients.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The StackTransientParent style
augments RaiseTransient and LowerTransient styles. Raising a
window with StackTransientParent style transfers the raise
action to the main <br>
window if the window being raised is a transient and its
main window has RaiseTransient style; this effect makes
raise on a transient act just like raise on its main - the
<br>
whole group is raised. Similar behavior holds for lowering a
whole group of transients when the main has LowerTransient
style. DontStackTransientParent turns this <br>
behavior off. (Dont)StackTransientParent has no effect if
RaiseTransient and LowerTransient are not used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A reasonable emulation of Motif
raise/lower on transients is possible like this</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Style * RaiseTransient <br>
Style * LowerTransient <br>
Style * StackTransientParent</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Extended Window Manager Hints
styles <br>
To understand the used terminology in this sub section,
please read the Extended Window Manager Hints section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EWMHDonateIcon instructs fvwm to
set the application ewmh icon hint with the icon that is
used by fvwm if the application does not provide such hint
(and if the icon used <br>
by fvwm is not an icon window). EWMHDonateMiniIcon does the
same thing for mini icons. This allows compliant pager,
taskbar, iconbox ...etc to display the same (mini) <br>
icons as fvwm. Note that on some hardware (e.g., 8-bit
displays) these styles can slow down window mapping and that
in general only one of these styles is needed by a <br>
compliant application. EWMHDontDonateIcon and
EWMHDontDonateMiniIcon restore the defaults which are to not
set any ewmh (mini) icons hints.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, if an application
provides an ewmh icon hint of small size (i.e., height and
width less than or equal to 22), then fvwm uses this icon as
its mini icon. <br>
EWMHMiniIconOverride instructs fvwm to ignore ewmh icons and
to use the mini icon provided by the MiniIcon style.
EWMHNoMiniIconOverride restores the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EWMHUseStackingOrderHints causes
fvwm to use EWMH hints and respect EWMH hints which change
the window layer. EWMHIgnoreStackingOrderHints causes fvwm
to ignore EWMH <br>
layer hints.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An application can ask for some
reserved space on the desktop by a hint. In the EWMH
terminology such a hint is called a strut and it is used to
compute the working area <br>
and may be used for window placement and in the maximize
command. EWMHIgnoreStrutHints causes fvwm to ignore such
hints, as EWMHUseStrutHints, causes fvwm to use it which
<br>
is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EWMHIgnoreStateHints causes fvwm
to ignore initial EWMH state hints when a new window is
mapped. The default EWMHUseStateHints causes fvwm to accept
such hints.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EWMHIgnoreWindowType causes fvwm
to ignore EWMH window type specification. The default
!EWMHIgnoreWindowType causes fvwm to style windows of
specified types as such.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EWMHMaximizeIgnoreWorkingArea
causes fvwm to ignore the EWMH working area when it executes
a Maximize command. With EWMHMaximizeUseWorkingArea the EWMH
working area is <br>
used as with EWMHMaximizeUseDynamicWorkingArea the EWMH
dynamic working area is used (the default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EWMHPlacementIgnoreWorkingArea
causes fvwm to ignore the EWMH working area when it places
(or places again) a window. With EWMHPlacementUseWorkingArea
the EWMH working <br>
area is taken in account as with
EWMHPlacementUseDynamicWorkingArea the EWMH dynamic working
area is taken in account (the default). Note that with the
<br>
MinOverlapPlacement and MinOverlapPercentPlacement placement
policy, the way the EWMH (dynamic) working area is taken in
account is configurable with the <br>
MinOverlapPlacementPenalties style.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Miscellaneous <br>
The BackingStore, BackingStoreOff and
BackingStoreWindowDefault determine if the X server uses
backing store for the window or not. BackingStore means that
the X server <br>
tries to keep the obscured parts of a window in memory. This
is usually slower if the client runs on the same machine as
the X server, but can be much faster if the <br>
connection is slow (see also SaveUnder below).
BackingStoreOff disables backing store for the window. By
default, fvwm does not enable or disable backing store
itself <br>
but leaves is as the window requested it. To revert back to
the application&rsquo;s choice, use the
BackingStoreWindowDefault style.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: This style is useless if
the X server does not allow backing store.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SaveUnder enables the
corresponding window attribute in the X server. For a window
using this style, the X server tries to store the graphics
below it in memory which is <br>
usually slower if the client runs on the same machine as the
X server. SaveUnder may speed up fvwm if the connection to
the X server is slow (e.g. over a modem link). To <br>
disable save under, use the SaveUnderOff style. This is the
default. See also BackingStore above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: This style is useless if
the X server does not allow save under.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ParentalRelativity enables
clients that use a background pixmap of type ParentRelative
to achieve transparency. Fvwm modules that support
transparent colorsets require <br>
this setting. Opacity is the default and should be used for
all non-transparent clients for better performance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MwmDecor makes fvwm attempt to
recognize and respect the mwm decoration hints that
applications occasionally use. To switch this style off, use
the NoDecorHint style.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MwmFunctions makes fvwm attempt
to recognize and respect the mwm prohibited operations hints
that applications occasionally use. HintOverride makes fvwm
shade out <br>
operations that mwm would prohibit, but it lets you perform
the operation anyway. NoFuncHint allows turns off the mwm
hints completely.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OLDecor makes fvwm attempt to
recognize and respect the olwm and olvwm hints that many
older XView and OLIT applications use. Switch this option
off with NoOLDecor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With GNOMEIgnoreHints fvwm
ignores all GNOME hints for the window, even if GNOME
compliance is compiled in. This is useful for those pesky
applications that try to be <br>
more clever than the user and use GNOME hints to force the
window manager to ignore the user&rsquo;s preferences. The
GNOMEUseHints style switches back to the default
behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UseDecor This style is
deprecated and will be removed in the future. There are
plans to replace it with a more flexible solution in
fvwm-3.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UseDecor accepts one argument:
the name of a decor created with AddToDecor. If no decor
name is specified, the &quot;Default&quot; decor is used.
Windows do not actually contain <br>
decors, but are always assigned to one. If the decor is
later modified with AddToDecor, the changes are visible for
all windows which are assigned to it. The decor for a <br>
window can be reassigned with ChangeDecor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UseStyle This style is
deprecated and will be removed in the future. There are
plans to replace it with a more flexible solution in
fvwm-3.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UseStyle takes one arg, which is
the name of another style. That way you can have unrelated
window names easily inherit similar traits without retyping.
For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Style rxvt UseStyle XTerm</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning: If a style is built
from one or more parent styles and the parent styles are
changed, the derived style is not modified. To achieve this
you have to issue the <br>
UseStyle line again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unmanaged Windows with the
Unmanaged style option are ignored by fvwm. They are not
decorated, can not be moved or resized, etc. You probably
want to use Bugopts <br>
RaiseOverUnmanaged too. This option can be turned off with
the !Unmanaged style. However, windows that are already
ignored at the time when the option is set must be <br>
recaptured with the Recapture command in order to become
managed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">State sets the initial value of
one of the 32 user defined states which are associated with
each window. The state number ranges from 0 to 31 and must
be given as an <br>
argument. The states have no meaning in fvwm, but they can
be checked in conditional commands like Next with the State
condition and manipulated with the State command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># turn on state 11 for xterms
... <br>
Style xterm State 11 <br>
# ... but not for rxvts. <br>
Style rxvt !State 11</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Windows with the WindowListSkip
styles do not appear in the menu that is created with the
WindowList command or the lists shown in several modules
like FvwmIconMan or <br>
FvwmWinList. In the modules, the style can usually be
ignored with an option. Please refer to the man page of the
module in question for further information. To disable <br>
this feature, use the default style WindowListHit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The styles CirculateSkip and
CirculateHit control whether the window is considered by
conditional commands, for example Next, Prev or All. Windows
with CirculateSkip, are <br>
never selected by conditional commands. However, the styles
can be overridden explicitly in the condition with the
CirculateHit, CirculateHitIcon or CirculateHitShaded <br>
conditions, and some conditional commands, e.g. Current and
All, do this by default. The styles CirculateSkipIcon,
CirculateHitIcon, CirculateSkipShaded and <br>
CirculateHitShaded work like CirculateSkip and CirculateHit
but apply only to iconic or shaded windows. Note: if
multiple ...Skip... options are combined, windows are <br>
only selected if they match none of the given conditions.
So, with</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Style * CirculateSkipIcon,
CirculateSkipShaded</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">only windows that are neither
iconic nor shaded are selected. Note: For historical
reasons, the conditional commands understand the names of
these styles as condition <br>
names. Take care not to confuse them.</p>

AddButtonStyle button [state] [style] [-- [!]flag ...] <br>
Adds a button style to button. button can be a button
number, or one of &quot;All&quot;, &quot;Left&quot; or
&quot;Right&quot;. state can be &quot;ActiveUp&quot;,
&quot;ActiveDown&quot;, &quot;InactiveUp&quot; or
&quot;InactiveDown&quot;, <br>
or &quot;Active&quot; (the same as both &quot;ActiveUp&quot;
and &quot;ActiveDown&quot;) or &quot;Inactive&quot; (the
same as both &quot;InactiveUp&quot; and
&quot;InactiveDown&quot;) or any of these 6 with
&quot;Toggled&quot; prepended. <br>
The &quot;Active&quot; states apply to the focused window,
the &quot;Inactive&quot; ones apply to all other windows.
The &quot;Up&quot; states apply to the non pressed buttons,
the &quot;Down&quot; ones apply <br>
to pressed buttons. The &quot;Toggled&quot; prefix refers to
maximized, shaded or sticky windows that have the
corresponding MwmDecor... button style set. Additionally,
the <br>
following shortcuts may be used: &quot;AllNormal&quot;,
&quot;AllToggled&quot;, &quot;AllActive&quot;,
&quot;AllInactive&quot;, &quot;AllUp&quot;,
&quot;AllDown&quot;. They are actually different masks for 4
individual states from <br>
8 total. These are supported too: &quot;AllActiveUp&quot;,
&quot;AllActiveDown&quot;, &quot;AllInactiveUp&quot;,
&quot;AllInactiveDown&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If state is omitted, then the
style is added to every state. If the style and flags are
enclosed in parentheses, then multiple state definitions can
be placed on a single <br>
line. Flags for additional button styles cannot be changed
after definition.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Buttons are drawn in the order
of definition, beginning with the most recent button style,
followed by those added with AddButtonStyle. To clear the
button style stack, <br>
change style flags, or for descriptions of available styles
and flags, see the ButtonStyle command. Examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ButtonStyle 1 Pixmap led.xpm --
Top Left <br>
ButtonStyle 1 ActiveDown HGradient 8 grey black <br>
ButtonStyle All -- UseTitleStyle <br>
AddButtonStyle 1 ActiveUp (Pixmap a.xpm) ActiveDown (Pixmap
b.xpm -- Top) <br>
AddButtonStyle 1 Vector 4 50x30@1 70x70@0 30x70@0
50x30@1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Initially for this example all
button states are set to a pixmap. The second line replaces
the &quot;ActiveDown&quot; state with a gradient (it
overrides the pixmap assigned to it <br>
in the line before, which assigned the same style to every
state). Then, the UseTitleStyle flag is set for all buttons,
which causes fvwm to draw any styles set with <br>
TitleStyle before drawing the buttons. Finally,
AddButtonStyle is used to place additional pixmaps for both
&quot;ActiveUp&quot; and &quot;ActiveDown&quot; states and a
vector button style <br>
is drawn on top of all states.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AddTitleStyle [state] [style]
[-- [!]flag ...] <br>
Adds a title style to the title-bar. state can be
&quot;ActiveUp&quot;, &quot;ActiveDown&quot;,
&quot;InactiveUp&quot; or &quot;InactiveDown&quot;, or
&quot;Active&quot; (the same as both &quot;ActiveUp&quot;
and &quot;ActiveDown&quot;) or <br>
&quot;Inactive&quot; (the same as both
&quot;InactiveUp&quot; and &quot;InactiveDown&quot;) or any
of these 6 with &quot;Toggled&quot; prepended. If state is
omitted, then the style is added to every state. If <br>
the style and flags are enclosed in parentheses, then
multiple state definitions can be placed on a single line.
This command is quite similar to the AddButtonStyle <br>
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Title-bars are drawn in the
order of definition, beginning with the most recent
TitleStyle, followed by those added with AddTitleStyle. To
clear the title style stack, <br>
change style flags, or for the descriptions of available

commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AddToDecor decor <br>
This command is deprecated and will be removed in the
future. There are plans to replace it with a more flexible
solution in fvwm-3.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Add or divert commands to the
decor named decor. A decor is a name given to the set of
commands which affect button styles, title-bar styles and
border styles. If decor <br>
does not exist it is created; otherwise the existing decor
is modified. Note: Earlier versions allowed to use the
HilightColor, HilightColorset and WindowFont commands in
<br>
decors. This is no longer possible. Please use the Style
command with the Hilight... and Font options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">New decors start out exactly
like the &quot;default&quot; decor without any style
definitions. A given decor may be applied to a set of
windows with the UseDecor option of the <br>
Style command. Modifying an existing decor affects all
windows which are currently assigned to it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AddToDecor is similar in usage
to the AddToMenu and AddToFunc commands, except that menus
and functions are replaced by ButtonStyle, AddButtonStyle,
TitleStyle, <br>
AddTitleStyle and BorderStyle commands. Decors created with
AddToDecor can be manipulated with ChangeDecor,
DestroyDecor, UpdateDecor and the Style option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following example creates a
decor &quot;FlatDecor&quot; and style &quot;FlatStyle&quot;.
They are distinct entities:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AddToDecor FlatDecor <br>

Defines a border style for windows. state can be either
&quot;Active&quot; or &quot;Inactive&quot;. If state is
omitted, then the style is set for both states. If the style
and flags are <br>
enclosed in parentheses, then multiple state definitions can
be specified per line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">style is a subset of the
available button styles, and can only be TiledPixmap
(uniform pixmaps which match the bevel colors work best this
way) or Colorset. If a &rsquo;!&rsquo; is <br>
prefixed to any flag, the behavior is negated. If style is
not specified, then one can change flags without resetting
the style.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The HiddenHandles flag hides the
corner handle dividing lines on windows with handles (this
option has no effect for !Handles windows). By default,
HiddenHandles is <br>
disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The NoInset flag supplements
HiddenHandles. If given, the inner bevel around the window
frame is not drawn. If HiddenHandles is not specified, the
frame looks a little <br>
strange.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Raised causes a raised relief
pattern to be drawn (default). Sunk causes a sunken relief
pattern to be drawn. Flat inhibits the relief pattern from
being drawn.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To decorate the active and
inactive window borders with a textured pixmap, one might
specify:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BorderStyle Active TiledPixmap

BorderStyle Active -- HiddenHandles NoInset</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To clear the style for both

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BorderStyle Inactive --

<p style="margin-top: 1em">title-bar buttons can inherit
the border style with the UseBorderStyle flag (see
ButtonStyle).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ButtonState [ActiveDown bool]
[Inactive bool] [InactiveDown bool] <br>
The ButtonState command controls which states of the window
titles and title buttons are used. The default is to use all
four states: &quot;ActiveUp&quot;, &quot;ActiveDown&quot;,
<br>
&quot;InactiveUp&quot; and &quot;InactiveDown&quot; (see
ButtonStyle and TitleStyle commands). The bool argument
after the key word controls if the designated state is used
(&quot;True&quot;) or not <br>
(&quot;False&quot;). The bool flag is the same as other
commands, and not limited to just &quot;True&quot; or
&quot;False&quot;; &quot;Yes&quot; and &quot;No&quot; may
also be used. The &quot;ActiveUp&quot; state cannot be <br>
deactivated. If no arguments are provided or the given
arguments are illegal, the default is restored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If ActiveDown argument is
&quot;False&quot;, no different button style for the pressed
down buttons used, instead &quot;ActiveUp&quot; state is
used even when button is pressed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If Inactive argument is
&quot;False&quot;, focused and unfocused windows look
similarly, the corresponding &quot;Active&quot; states are
always used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If InactiveDown argument is
&quot;False&quot; (only applied when Inactive is
&quot;True&quot;), the pressed titles and title buttons in
non-focused windows are drawn using &quot;InactiveUp&quot;
or <br>
&quot;ActiveUp&quot; states depending on the values of the
other key words.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ButtonStyle button [state]
[style] [-- [!]flag ...] <br>
Sets the button style for a title-bar button. button is the
title-bar button number between 0 and 9, or one of
&quot;All&quot;, &quot;Left&quot;, &quot;Right&quot;, or
&quot;Reset&quot;. Button numbering is <br>
described in the Mouse command section. If the style and
flags are enclosed in parentheses, then multiple state
definitions can be specified per line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">state refers to which button
state should be set. Button states are defined as follows:
&quot;ActiveUp&quot; and &quot;ActiveDown&quot; refer to the
un-pressed and pressed states for buttons <br>
on active windows; while the &quot;InactiveUp&quot; and
&quot;InactiveDown&quot; states denote buttons on inactive
windows. The shortcut &quot;Active&quot; denotes both
&quot;ActiveUp&quot; and &quot;ActiveDown&quot; <br>
states. Shortcut &quot;Inactive&quot; denotes both
&quot;InactiveUp&quot; and &quot;InactiveDown&quot; states.
The similar state names like just described, but with the
&quot;Toggled&quot; prefix are used <br>
instead for title buttons which have one of the MwmDecorMax,
MwmDecorShade, MwmDecorStick or MwmDecorLayer hints, if the
window is maximized, shaded, sticky or placed on <br>
specific layer, respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AddToDecor Default <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Additionally, the following
shortcuts may be used: &quot;AllNormal&quot;,
&quot;AllToggled&quot;, &quot;AllActive&quot;,
&quot;AllInactive&quot;, &quot;AllUp&quot;,
&quot;AllDown&quot;. They are actually different masks for 4
<br>
individual states from 8 total. These are supported too:
&quot;AllActiveUp&quot;, &quot;AllActiveDown&quot;,
&quot;AllInactiveUp&quot;, &quot;AllInactiveDown&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If state is specified, that
particular button state is set. If state is omitted, every
state is set. Specifying a style destroys the current style
(use AddButtonStyle to <br>
avoid this).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If style is omitted, then
state-dependent flags can be set for the primary button
style without destroying the current style. Examples (each
line should be considered <br>
independent):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ButtonStyle Left -- flat <br>
ButtonStyle All ActiveUp (-- flat) Inactive (-- flat)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first line sets every state
of the left buttons to flat, while the second sets only the
&quot;ActiveUp&quot; and &quot;Inactive&quot; states of
every button to flat (only flags are <br>
changed; the buttons&rsquo; individual styles are not
changed).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to reset all buttons
to their defaults:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ButtonStyle Reset</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To reset the
&quot;ActiveUp&quot; button state of button 1 to the
default:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ButtonStyle 1 ActiveUp
Default</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To reset all button states of
button 1 to the default of button number 2:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ButtonStyle 1 Default 2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For any button, multiple state
definitions can be given on one line by enclosing the style
and flags in parentheses. If only one definition per line is
given the <br>
parentheses can be omitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">flags affect the specified
state. If a &rsquo;!&rsquo; is prefixed to any flag, its
behavior is negated. The available state-dependent flags for
all styles are described here (the <br>
ButtonStyle entry deals with state-independent flags).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Raised causes a raised relief
pattern to be drawn.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sunk causes a sunken relief
pattern to be drawn.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Flat inhibits the relief pattern
from being drawn.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UseTitleStyle causes the given
button state to render the current title style before
rendering the buttons&rsquo; own styles. The Raised, Flat
and Sunk TitleStyle flags are <br>
ignored since they are redundant in this context.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UseBorderStyle causes the button
to inherit the decorated BorderStyle options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Raised, Sunk and Flat are
mutually exclusive, and can be specified for the initial
ButtonStyle only. UseTitleStyle and UseBorderStyle are also
mutually exclusive (both <br>
can be off however). The default is Raised with both
UseBorderStyle and UseTitleStyle left unset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Important <br>
for the &quot;ActiveDown&quot; and &quot;InactiveDown&quot;
states: When a button is pressed, the relief is inverted.
Because of this, to obtain the raised look in
&quot;ActiveDown&quot; or <br>
&quot;InactiveDown&quot; states you must specify the
opposite of the desired relief (i.e. Sunk for
&quot;ActiveDown&quot; or &quot;InactiveDown&quot;). This
behavior is consistent, but may seem <br>
confusing at first. The same applies to the
&quot;Toggled&quot; states.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Button styles are classified as
non-destructive, partially destructive, or fully
destructive. Non-destructive styles do not affect the image.
Partially destructive <br>
styles can obscure some or all parts of the underlying image
(i.e. Pixmap). Fully destructive styles obscure the entire
underlying image (i.e. Solid or one of the <br>
gradient styles). Thus, if stacking styles with
AddButtonStyle (or AddTitleStyle for title-bars), use care
in sequencing styles to minimize redraw.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The available styles are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Simple, Default, Solid,
Colorset, Vector, ?Gradient, Pixmap, AdjustedPixmap,
ShrunkPixmap, StretchedPixmap, TiledPixmap, MiniIcon</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The description of these styles
and their arguments follow:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Simple style does nothing.
There are no arguments, and this style is an example of a
non-destructive button style.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Default style conditionally
accepts one argument: a number which specifies the default
button number to load. If the style command given is
ButtonStyle or <br>
AddButtonStyle, the argument is optional (if given, it
overrides the current button). If a command other than
ButtonStyle or AddButtonStyle is used, the number must be
<br>
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Solid style fills the button
with a solid color. The relief border color is not affected.
The color is specified as a single argument. This style is
fully <br>
destructive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Colorset cs [alpha] style
fills the button with the Colorset cs. The optional alpha
argument is a percentage between 0 and 100. It causes fvwm
to merge the colorset <br>
background onto the button using this percentage. If the
percentage is 0 the colorset background is hidden and if it
is 100 the colorset background is fully applied. The <br>
default is 100. So, the destructiveness depends on the alpha
argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Vector num
X[offsetp]xY[offsetp]@C ... style draws a line pattern.
Since this is a standard button style, the keyword Vector is
optional, num is a number of point <br>
specifications of the form X[offsetp]xY[offsetp]@C ... X and
Y are point coordinates inside the button, given in percents
(from 0 to 100). An optional absolute offset in <br>
pixels, can be given as &quot;+&lt;offset&gt;p&quot; for a
positive or &quot;-&lt;offset&gt;p&quot; for a negative
offset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C specifies a line color (0 -
the shadow color, 1 - the highlight color, 2 - the
background color, 3 - the foreground color, 4 - only move
the point, do not draw). The <br>
first point color is not used. You can use up to 10000
points in a line pattern. This style is partially
destructive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The specification is a little
cumbersome:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ButtonStyle 2 Vector 4 50x30@1
70x70@0 30x70@0 50x30@1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">then the button 2 decoration
uses a 4-point pattern consisting of a line from (x=50,y=30)
to (70,70) in the shadow color (@0), and then to (30,70) in
the shadow color, and <br>
finally to (50,30) in the highlight color (@1). Is that too
confusing? See the fvwm web pages for some examples with
screenshots.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A more complex example of
Vector:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ButtonStyle 8 Vector 10 45x65@2
45x75@3 20x75@3 20x50@3 35x50@3 35x65@1 35x25@1 75x25@1
75x65@0 35x65@0 <br>
ButtonStyle 0 Vector 10 45x65@2 45x75@0 20x75@0 20x50@1
45x50@1 45x65@0 75x65@3 75x25@3 35x25@3 35x47@3</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ?Gradient styles denote
color gradients. Fill in the question mark with any one of
the defined gradient types. Please refer to the Color
Gradients section for a <br>
description of the gradient syntax. The gradient styles are
fully destructive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Pixmap style displays a
pixmap. A pixmap should be specified as an argument. For
example, the following would give button number 2 the same
pixmap for all 4 states <br>
(2 active and 2 inactive), and button number 4 all different
pixmaps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ButtonStyle 2 Pixmap
my_pixmap.xpm <br>
ButtonStyle 4 ActiveUp (Pixmap activeup.xpm) ActiveDown
(Pixmap activedown.xpm) Inactive (Pixmap inactiveup.xpm)
<br>
ButtonStyle 4 InactiveDown Pixmap inactivedown.xpm</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The pixmap specification can be
given as an absolute or relative pathname (see ImagePath).
If the pixmap cannot be found, the button style reverts to
Simple. Flags <br>
specific to the Pixmap style are Left, Right, Top, and
Bottom. These can be used to justify the pixmap (default is
centered for both directions). Pixmap transparency is <br>
used for the color &quot;None.&quot; This style is partially
destructive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The AdjustedPixmap style is
similar to the Pixmap style. But the image is resized to
exactly fit the button.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ShrunkPixmap style is
similar to the Pixmap style. But if the image is bigger than
the button the image is resized to fit into the button.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The StretchedPixmap style is
similar to the Pixmap style. But if the image is smaller
than the button the image is resized to cover the
button.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The TiledPixmap style accepts a
pixmap to be tiled as the button background. One pixmap is
specified as an argument. Pixmap transparency is not used.
This style is <br>
fully destructive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The MiniIcon style draws the
window&rsquo;s miniature icon in the button, which is
specified with the MiniIcon option of the Style command.
This button style accepts no <br>
arguments. Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Style * MiniIcon mini-bx2.xpm
<br>
Style xterm MiniIcon mini-term.xpm <br>
Style Emacs MiniIcon mini-doc.xpm</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ButtonStyle 1 MiniIcon</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ButtonStyle button - [!]flag ...
<br>
Sets state-independent flags for the specified button.
State-independent flags affect button behavior. Each flag is
separated by a space. If a &rsquo;!&rsquo; is prefixed to
the <br>
flag then the behavior is negated. The special flag Clear
clears any existing flags.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following flags are usually
used to tell fvwm which buttons should be affected by mwm
function hints (see MwmFunctions option of the Style
command. This is not done <br>
automatically since you might have buttons bound to complex
functions, for instance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MwmDecorMenu should be assigned
to title-bar buttons which display a menu. The default
assignment is the leftmost button. When a window with the
MwmFunctions Style <br>
option requests not to show this button, it is hidden.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MwmDecorMin should be assigned
to title-bar buttons which minimize or iconify the window.
The default assignment is the second button over from the
rightmost button. <br>
When a window with the MwmFunctions Style option requests
not to show this button, it is hidden.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MwmDecorMax should be assigned
to title-bar buttons which maximize the window. The default
assignment is the rightmost button. When a window with the
MwmFunctions Style <br>
option requests not to show this button, it is hidden. When
the window is maximized, the vector pattern on the button
looks pressed in.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MwmDecorShade should be assigned
to title-bar buttons which shade the window (see WindowShade
command). When the window is shaded, the vector pattern on
the button looks <br>
pressed in.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MwmDecorStick should be assigned
to title-bar buttons which make the window sticky. When the
window is sticky, the vector pattern on the button looks
pressed in.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The flag MwmDecorLayer layer
should be assigned to title-bar buttons which place the
window in the layer numbered layer. When the window is on
that specific layer, the <br>
vector pattern on the button looks pressed in.</p>

before the UseDecor style is applied again unless the decor
was destroyed with the recreate option. The decor named
&quot;Default&quot; cannot be destroyed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DestroyDecor CustomDecor1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TitleStyle [justification]
[Height [num]] [MinHeight [num]] <br>
Sets attributes for the title-bar. Justifications can be
Centered, RightJustified or LeftJustified. Height sets the
title bar&rsquo;s height to an amount in pixels. MinHeight
<br>
sets the minimal height in pixels of the title bar. Defaults
are Centered, the window&rsquo;s font height and no minimal
height. To reset the font height to the default value, <br>
omit the num argument after the Height keyword. The
MinHeight height is reseted by Height or if given with no
argument. Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TitleStyle LeftJustified Height
24</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TitleStyle [state] [style] [--
[!]flag ...] <br>
Sets the style for the title-bar. See also AddTitleStyle and
ButtonStyle state can be one of &quot;ActiveUp&quot;,
&quot;ActiveDown&quot;, &quot;InactiveUp&quot;, or
&quot;InactiveDown&quot;. Shortcuts like <br>
&quot;Active&quot; and &quot;Inactive&quot; are allowed. The
states with the &quot;Toggled&quot; prefix are allowed too,
the title itself does not use &quot;Toggled&quot; states,
but these states are used for <br>
the buttons with ButtonStyle UseTitleStyle. If state is
omitted, then the style is added to every state. If
parentheses are placed around the style and flags, then <br>
multiple state definitions can be given per line. style can
be omitted so that flags can be set while not destroying the
current style.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a &rsquo;!&rsquo; is prefixed
to any flag, its behavior is negated. Valid flags for each
state include Raised, Flat and Sunk (these are mutually
exclusive). The default is <br>
Raised. See the note in ButtonStyle regarding the
&quot;ActiveDown&quot; state. Examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TitleStyle ActiveUp HGradient 16
navy black <br>
TitleStyle ActiveDown (Solid red -- flat) Inactive
(TiledPixmap wood.xpm) <br>
TitleStyle ActiveUp (-- Flat) ActiveDown (-- Raised)
InactiveUp (-- Flat) InactiveDown (-- Sunk)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This sets the
&quot;ActiveUp&quot; state to a horizontal gradient, the
&quot;ActiveDown&quot; state to solid red, and the
&quot;Inactive&quot; states to a tiled wood pixmap. Finally,
&quot;ActiveUp&quot; and <br>
&quot;InactiveUp&quot; are set to look flat, while
&quot;ActiveDown&quot; set to be sunk (the Raised flag for
the &quot;ActiveDown&quot; state causes it to appear sunk
due to relief inversion), and <br>
&quot;InactiveDown&quot; is set to look raised. An example
which sets flags for all states:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TitleStyle -- flat</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For a flattened look:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TitleStyle -- flat <br>
ButtonStyle All Active (-- flat) Inactive (-- flat)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TitleStyle accepts all the
ButtonStyle styles and arguments:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Simple, Default, Solid,
Colorset, Vector, ?Gradient, Pixmap, AdjustedPixmap,
ShrunkPixmap, StretchedPixmap, TiledPixmap, MiniIcon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See the ButtonStyle command for
a description of all these styles and their arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition to these styles
TitleStyle accepts a powerful MultiPixmap option. This
allows you to specify different pixmaps, colorsets or colors
for different parts of the <br>
titlebar. Some of them are tiled or stretched to fit a
particular space; others are discrete &quot;transition&quot;
images. The definable sections are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Main <br>
The full titlebar</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LeftMain <br>
Left of title text</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RightMain <br>
Right of title text</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UnderText <br>
Underneath title text</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LeftOfText <br>
just to the left of the title text</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RightOfText <br>
just to the right of the title text</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LeftEnd <br>
at the far left end of the titlebar (just after left buttons
if any)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RightEnd <br>
at the far right end of the titlebar (just before right
buttons if any)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Buttons <br>
under buttons in case of UseTitleStyle</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LeftButtons <br>
under left buttons in case of UseTitleStyle</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RightButtons <br>
under right buttons in case of UseTitleStyle</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">None of these are mandatory
except for Main (or, if you do not define Main you must
define both LeftMain and RightMain). If no Buttons pixmaps
are defined and <br>
UseTitleStyle is specified for one or more buttons, Main,
LeftMain or RightMain are used as appropriate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The syntax for this style type
is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MultiPixmap section style arg,
...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">continuing for whatever you want
to define. The style can be either TiledPixmap,
AdjustedPixmap, Colorset or Solid. See the ButtonStyle
command for the description of <br>
these styles. In the case of a transition section, LeftEnd,
LeftOfText, RightOfText or RightEnd, AdjustedPixmap only
resize the pixmap in the &quot;y&quot; direction. For the
<br>
Colorset and Solid styles a width of the half of the title
bar height is assumed for the transition sections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MultiPixmap Main AdjustedPixmap
foo.xpm, UnderText TiledPixmap bar.xpm, Buttons Colorset
2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the old syntax is
still supported: if the style is omitted, TiledPixmap is
assumed and adding &quot;(stretched)&quot; between the
section and the file name implies <br>
AdjustedPixmap.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UpdateDecor [decor] <br>
This command is deprecated and will be removed in the
future. There are plans to replace it with a more flexible
solution in fvwm-3.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command is kept mainly for
backward compatibility. Since all elements of a decor are
updated immediately when they are changed, this command is
mostly useless.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Updates window decorations.
decor is an optional argument which specifies the decor to
update. If given, only windows which are assigned to that
particular decor are <br>
updated. This command is useful, for instance, after a
ButtonStyle, TitleStyle or BorderStyle (possibly used in
conjunction with AddToDecor). Specifying an invalid decor
<br>
results in all windows being updated. This command is less
disturbing than Recapture, but does not affect window style
options as Recapture does.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Controlling the Virtual Desktop
<br>
Desk arg1 [arg2] [min max] <br>
This command has been renamed. Please see GotoDesk
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DesktopName desk name <br>
Defines the name of the desktop number desk to name. This
name is used in the WindowList command and in the FvwmPager
where it override the Label configuration option. <br>
Moreover, if consecutive names starting from desktop 0 are
defined, then these names can be used by any EWMH compliant
application (as a pager).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DesktopSize HorizontalxVertical
<br>
Defines the virtual desktop size in units of the physical
screen size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EdgeResistance
delayEdgeResistance scrolling moving [xinerama-scrolling]
<br>
Tells how hard it should be to change the desktop viewport
by moving the mouse over the edge of the screen. The
parameter tells how many milliseconds the pointer must <br>
spend on the screen edge before fvwm moves the viewport.
This is intended for people who use</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EdgeScroll 100 100</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">but find themselves accidentally
flipping pages when they do not want to. If -1 is given as
the delay, scrolling is disabled completely.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The second form of invocation
with two or three arguments is obsolete and should be
replaced with the following three commands as needed:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EdgeScroll horizontal[p]
vertical[p] [wrap | wrapx | wrapy] <br>
Specifies the percentage of a page to scroll when the cursor
hits the edge of a page. A trailing &rsquo;p&rsquo; changes
the interpretation to mean pixels. If you do not want any
<br>
paging or scrolling when you hit the edge of a page
include</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">is used fvwm scrolls by whole
pages, wrapping around at the edge of the desktop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EdgeThickness 0 | 1 | 2 <br>
This is the width or height of the invisible window that
fvwm creates on the edges of the screen that are used for
the edge scrolling feature.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to enable page
scrolling via the mouse, four windows called the &quot;pan
frames&quot; are placed at the very edge of the screen. This
is how fvwm detects the mouse&rsquo;s <br>
presence at the window edge. Because of the way this works,
they need to be at the top of the stack and eat mouse
events, so if you have any kind of error along the lines
<br>
of: &quot;mouse clicks at the edge of the screen do the
wrong thing&quot; you&rsquo;re having trouble with the pan
frames and (assuming you do not use the mouse to flip
between pages) <br>
should set the EdgeThickness to 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A value of 0 completely disables
mouse edge scrolling, even while dragging a window. 1 gives
the smallest pan frames, which seem to work best except on
some servers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pan frames of 1 or 2 pixels can
sometimes be confusing, for example, if you drag a window
over the edge of the screen, so that it straddles a pan
frame, clicks on the <br>
window, near the edge of the screen are treated as clicks on
the root window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EwmhBaseStruts left right top
bottom <br>
Where left, right, top and bottom are positive or null
integers which define bands at the edge of the screen. left
defines a band on the left of your screen of width <br>
left, right defines a band on the right of your screen of
width right, top defines a band on the top of your screen of
height top and bottom defines a band on the bottom <br>
of your screen of height bottom. The unit is the pixel and
the default is 0 0 0 0. These areas define additional
reserved space to the reserved space defined by some <br>
ewmh compliant applications. This is used to compute the
Working Area. See the Extended Window Manager Hints section
for a definition of the Working Area.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EwmhNumberOfDesktops num [max]
<br>
This command is useful only for an ewmh compliant pager or
taskbar (as kpager or kicker taskbar) and not for fvwm
modules ( FvwmPager or FvwmIconMan). It causes a <br>
compliant application to consider at least num desktops
(desktop 0 to desktop num-1). The optional argument max
causes a compliant application to never consider more than
<br>
max desktops. If max is 0 (the default) there is no
limitation. The actual number of desktops is determined
dynamically. It is at least num, but it can be d if there is
<br>
a window on desktop d-1 (or if the current desktop is
desktop d-1) and d is less or equal to max or max is null.
Moreover, a compliant pager can ask to change num itself.
<br>
This is accepted by fvwm only if this number is less than or
equal to max or if max is null. Note that negative desktops
are not supported by the ewmh specification. The <br>
default is 4 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GotoDesk [prev | arg1 [arg2]
[min max]] <br>
Switches the current viewport to another desktop (workspace,
room).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The command takes 1, 2, 3, or 4
arguments. A single argument is interpreted as a relative
desk number. Two arguments are understood as a relative and
an absolute desk <br>
number. Three arguments specify a relative desk and the
minimum and maximum of the allowable range. Four arguments
specify the relative, absolute, minimum and maximum <br>
values. (Desktop numbers can be negative). If a literal prev
is given as the single argument, the last visited desk
number is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If arg1 is non zero then the
next desktop number is the current desktop number plus
arg1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If arg1 is zero then the new
desktop number is arg2. (If arg2 is not present, then the
command has no effect.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If min and max are given, the
new desktop number is no smaller than min and no bigger than
max. Values out of this range are truncated (if you gave an
absolute desk <br>
number) or wrapped around (if you gave a relative desk
number).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The syntax is the same as for
MoveToDesk, which moves a window to a different desktop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The number of active desktops is
determined dynamically. Only desktops which contain windows
or are currently being displayed are active. Desktop numbers
must be between <br>
2147483647 and -2147483648 (is that enough?).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GotoDeskAndPage prev | desk
xpage ypage <br>
Switches the current viewport to another desktop and page,
similar to the GotoDesk and GotoPage commands. The new desk
is desk and the new page is (xpage,ypage).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GotoPage prev | [options] x[p]
y[p] <br>
Moves the desktop viewport to page (x,y). The upper left
page is (0,0), the upper right is (M,0), where M is one less
than the current number of horizontal pages <br>
specified in the DesktopSize command. The lower left page is
(0,N), and the lower right page is (M,N), where N is the
desktop&rsquo;s vertical size as specified in the <br>
DesktopSize command. To switch to a page relative to the
current one add a trailing &rsquo;p&rsquo; after any or both
numerical arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Possible options are wrapx and
wrapy to wrap around the x or y coordinate when the viewport
is moved beyond the border of the desktop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To go to the last visited page
use prev as the first argument. The GotoPage function should
not be used in a pop-up menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Go to page (2,3) <br>
GotoPage 2 3</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Go to lowest and rightmost
page <br>
GotoPage -1 -1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Go to last page visited <br>
GotoPage prev</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Go two pages to the right and
one page up <br>
GotoPage +2p -1p</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Scroll [horizonal[p] vertical[p]
| reverse] <br>
Scrolls the virtual desktop&rsquo;s viewport by horizontal
pages in the x-direction and vertical pages in the
y-direction or starts interactive scrolling of the viewport.
<br>
Either or both entries may be negative. Both horizontal and
vertical values are expressed in percent of pages, so</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Scroll 100 100</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">means to scroll down and right
by one full page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Scroll 50 25</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">means to scroll right half a
page and down a quarter of a page. The Scroll function
should not be called from pop-up menus. Normally, scrolling
stops at the edge of the <br>
desktop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the horizontal and vertical
percentages are 100 or more and are multiplied by 1000 then
scrolling wraps around at the edge of the desktop. If</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Scroll 100000 0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">is executed over and over fvwm
moves to the next desktop page on each execution and wraps
around at the edge of the desktop, so that every page is hit
in turn.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the letter &rsquo;p&rsquo; is
appended to each coordinate (horizontal and/or vertical),
then the scroll amount is measured in pixels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Without arguments or if the
option reverse is given interactive scrolling takes place.
The viewport scrolls as the mouse is moved. With the reverse
option scrolling is <br>
done in opposite direction of the mouse movement, and
without it scrolling in the same direction as the mouse.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The binding</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mouse 1 A CM Scroll reverse</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gives an effect of grabbing and
dragging the viewport with button 1 if Control and Meta is
pressed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Xinerama [bool] <br>
Enables Xinerama support if the boolean argument is true and
disables it if the argument is false. Calling this command
without arguments turns on Xinerama support if it <br>
was disabled before and turns it off if it was enabled. For
example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Turn Xinerama support on, use
primary screen 2 <br>
XineramaPrimaryScreen 2 <br>
Xinerama on <br>
# Turn it off again <br>
Xinerama off</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">XineramaPrimaryScreen
[primary-screen] <br>
Takes an integer number or &rsquo;g&rsquo; or
&rsquo;c&rsquo; as its argument. A number is taken as the
number of the Xinerama screen that is to be used as the
primary screen. The primary <br>
screen can be used as the preferred screen to place windows
with</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">XineramaPrimaryScreen &lt;screen
number&gt; <br>
Style * StartsOnScreen p</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The primary screen is used in
some of the modules and for the default icon box too. Any
number that is zero or more is taken as the primary
screen&rsquo;s number. Instead, the <br>
letter &rsquo;c&rsquo; indicates to use the current screen
(containing the pointer) whenever the primary screen is
used. This may be very confusing under some circumstances.
With <br>
&rsquo;g&rsquo;, the global screen is used as the primary
screen, effectively disabling the primary screen. Calling
this function with any other argument (including none)
resets the <br>
primary screen to 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">XineramaSls [bool] <br>
For multi-screen implementations other than Xinerama, such
as Single Logical Screen, it is possible to simulate a
Xinerama configuration if the total screen seen by fvwm <br>
is made up of equal sized monitors in a rectangular grid.
The XineramaSls command turns SLS support on or off or
toggles it to the opposite state, depending on if the <br>
boolean argument is &quot;True&quot;, &quot;False&quot; or
&quot;toggle&quot;. If no argument is given, this is treated
like &quot;toggle&quot;. The default layout uses one by one
screens. To configure the <br>
layout, use the XineramaSlsSize or XineramaSlsScreens
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">XineramaSlsSize Horizontal
Vertical <br>
This command configures the layout of the Single Logical
screen feature. It takes two arguments, Horizontal and
Vertical which must be an integer value dividing evenly <br>
into the total desktop width, and height. For an example
with two monitors side by side which appear as one screen
through the X-Server with the right screen as the <br>
primary screen, use:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">XineramaSlsSize 2x1 <br>

XineramaPrimaryScreen 1 <br>
Xinerama On</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">XineramaSlsScreens
number-of-screens [screen-spec ...] <br>
This command configures the layout of the Single Logical
screen feature. Its first argument is the number of screens
to use. It must be followed by exactly this number <br>
of screen-spec arguments. Each of these can be written
either in standard X geometry format:
&quot;&lt;width&gt;x&lt;height&gt;+&lt;x&gt;+&lt;y&gt;&quot;
or as a space separated list of numbers: &quot;x y <br>
width height&quot;. Both ways of describing screens can be
mixed in a single command. All four numbers must be
supplied. The x and y values specify the origin of the
screen <br>
in relation to the global screen&rsquo;s origin while width
and height specify the size of the screen in pixels. No
checks are done if the geometries make sense, so it is <br>
possible to define overlapping screens (with random results)
or screens that are not visible at all.</p>

prints the definition for the given function to stderr. It
is useful to find out how fvwm handles quoting and <br>
for debugging functions</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Exec command <br>
Executes command. You should not use an ampersand
&rsquo;&amp;&rsquo; at the end of the command. You probably
want to use an additional &quot;exec&quot; at the beginning
of command. Without <br>
that, the shell that fvwm invokes to run your command stays
until the command exits. In effect, you&rsquo;ll have twice
as many processes running as you need. Note that some <br>
shells are smart enough to avoid this, but it never hurts to
include the &quot;exec&quot; anyway.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following example binds
function key F1 in the root window, with no modifiers, to
the exec function. The program rxvt is started with an
assortment of options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Key F1 R N Exec exec rxvt -fg
yellow -bg blue -e /bin/tcsh</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that this function
doesn&rsquo;t wait for command to complete, so things
like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Exec &quot;echo AddToMenu ...
&gt; /tmp/file&quot; <br>
Read /tmp/file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">do not work reliably (see the
PipeRead command).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ExecUseShell [shell] <br>
Makes the Exec command use the specified shell, or the value
of the $SHELL environment variable if no shell is specified,
instead of the default Bourne shell (/bin/sh).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ExecUseShell <br>
ExecUseShell /usr/local/bin/tcsh</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Function FunctionName <br>
Used to bind a previously defined function to a key or mouse
button. The following example binds mouse button 1 to a
function called &quot;Move-or-Raise&quot;, whose definition
was <br>
provided as an example earlier in this man page. After
performing this binding fvwm executes the
&quot;move-or-raise&quot; function whenever button 1 is
pressed in a window&rsquo;s <br>
title-bar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mouse 1 T A Function
Move-or-Raise</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The keyword Function may be
omitted if FunctionName does not coincide with an fvwm
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning: Please read the
comments on executing complex functions in the section
Scripting and Complex Functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">InfoStoreAdd key value <br>
Stores the value at the given key. This is useful to store
generic information used in the lifetime of an fvwm config
file. For example storing program preferences for <br>
opening video files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The purpose of this command is
to store internal information to fvwm which can be used bu
fvwm functions, or when opening programs of a certain type.
Previous to this <br>
command the only way to do this was via SetEnv but this is
discouraged because it places such information in the
environment, which pollutes it and makes the information
<br>
global to other processes started by fvwm which may then
modify them which might not be what&rsquo;s wanted. Hence
the point of InfoStoreAdd is to still allow for such <br>
information to be stored, but kept internal to fvwm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In this way, one can build up as
many key/value pairs as needed. Recalling the value of a
given key happens through fvwm&rsquo;s usual expansion
mechanism. See the Command <br>
Expansion section for more details. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">InfoStoreAdd teddybearprog
xteddy</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Echo the value of
teddybearprog <br>
Echo $[infostore.teddybearprog]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Removing an entry from the
InfoStore is done with the InfoStoreRemove command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">InfoStoreRemove key <br>
Removes an entry at the given key from the InfoStore.
Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">InfoStoreRemove
teddybearprog</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Nop <br>
Does nothing. This is used to insert a blank line or
separator in a menu. If the menu item specification is</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AddToMenu MyMenu &quot; &quot;
Nop</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">then a blank line is inserted.
If it looks like</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+ &quot;&quot; Nop</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">then a separator line is
inserted. Can also be used as the double-click action for
Menu or Popup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PipeRead command [quiet] <br>
Causes fvwm to read commands from the output of the command.
This command is executed by /bin/sh as if you typed it on
the command line. If the command consists of more <br>
than one word it must be quoted. Useful for building up
dynamic menu entries based on a directories contents, for
example. If the keyword Quiet follows the command no <br>
message is produced if the command is not found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AddToMenu HomeDirMenu <br>
PipeRead &rsquo;for i in $HOME/*; do echo &quot;+ $i Exec
xterm -e vi $i&quot;; done&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: The PipeRead changes the
pointer to a watch cursor by default during execution.
However, some commands, for example xwd, need to take
control of the pointer <br>
themselves and do not work. To disable the watch cursor, use
the command prior to PipeRead</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BusyCursor Read off</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The PipeRead command executes
synchronously. If you want to Exec something, but need the
command to run synchronously, you might do something
like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PipeRead &rsquo;command
1&gt;&amp;2&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The redirection causes any
output from the program to go to stderr instead of being
read as a sequence of commands by fvwm. PipeRead returns 1
if the given command could <br>
be executed or -1 if not (see the section Conditional
Commands for the meaning of return codes).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Read filename [quiet] <br>
Causes fvwm to read commands from the file named filename.
If the keyword Quiet follows the command no message is
produced if the file is not found. If the file name <br>
does not begin with a slash (&rsquo;/&rsquo;), fvwm looks in
the user&rsquo;s data directory, then the system data
directory. The user&rsquo;s data directory is by default
$HOME/.fvwm. It can <br>
be overridden by exporting FVWM_USERDIR set to any other
directory. The Read command returns 1 if the given file
could be read or -1 if not (see the section Conditional <br>
Commands for the meaning of return codes).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SetEnv variable value <br>
Set an environment variable to a new value, similar to the
shell&rsquo;s export or setenv command. The variable and its
value are inherited by processes started directly by <br>
fvwm. This can be especially useful in conjunction with the
FvwmM4 module. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SetEnv height HEIGHT</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">makes the FvwmM4 set variable
HEIGHT usable by processes started by fvwm as the
environment variable $height. If value includes whitespace,
you should enclose it in <br>
quotes. If no value is given, the variable is deleted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Silent command <br>
A number of commands require a window to operate on. If no
window was selected when such a function is invoked the user
is asked to select a window. Sometimes this <br>
behavior is unwanted, for example if the function was called
by a module and the window that was selected at first does
not exist anymore. You can prevent this by putting <br>
Silent in front of the fvwm command. If a function that
needs a window is called with Silent without a window
selected, it simply returns without doing anything. If <br>
Silent is used on a user defined function it affects all
function and sub function calls until the original function
exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another usage of Silent is with
binding commands Key, PointerKey and Mouse, this disables
error messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Silent also disables the error
message for non-existent commands. Note: This command is
treated as a prefix to its command. Expansion of the command
line is done as if <br>
Silent was not there.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Silent Move 0 0 <br>
Silent User_defined_function <br>
# do not complain on keyboards without &quot;Help&quot; key
<br>
Silent Key Help R A Popup HelpMenu</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UnsetEnv [variable] <br>
Unset an environment variable, similar to shell&rsquo;s
export or unsetenv command. The variable then is removed
from the environment array inherited by processes started
<br>
directly by fvwm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Wait window <br>
This command is intended to be used in fvwm functions only.
It causes execution of a function to pause until a new
window matching window appears. This can be a window&rsquo;s
<br>
name, class, or resource string. It may contain the
wildcards &rsquo;*&rsquo; and &rsquo;?&rsquo;, which are
matched in the usual Unix filename manner. This is
particularly useful in the <br>
&quot;InitFunction&quot; if you are trying to start windows
on specific desktops:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AddToFunc InitFunction <br>
+ I Exec exec xterm -geometry 80x64+0+0 <br>
+ I Wait xterm <br>
+ I GotoDesk 0 2 <br>
+ I Exec exec xmh -font fixed -geometry 507x750+0+0 <br>
+ I Wait xmh <br>
+ I GotoDesk 0 0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The above function starts an
xterm on the current desk, waits for it to map itself, then
switches to desk 2 and starts an xmh. After the xmh window
appears control moves <br>
to desk 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fvwm remains partially
functional during a wait, but any input from the modules is
queued up and processed only after the window appears or the
command is aborted. For <br>
example, windows can not be focused with FvwmTaskBar or
FvwmWinList during a wait.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can escape from a Wait pause
by pressing Ctrl-Alt-Escape (where Alt is the first
modifier). To redefine this key sequence see the EscapeFunc
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Conditional Commands <br>
Conditional commands are commands that are only executed if
certain conditions are met. Most conditional commands work
on windows, like Next, ThisWindow or All. There is one <br>
conditional command, Test, that works on global conditions
unrelated to windows. The syntax of the conditions is
described below. For readability, the list of conditions is
<br>
located at the end of this section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Return Codes <br>
All commands in this section (unless specifically stated for
the command) also have a return code that can be 1 (if the
condition was met) or 0 (if the condition was not <br>
met). Some commands may return -1 which means that an error
occurred and the return code is useless. The Break command
returns -2. Additionally, the return codes of <br>
commands run in a complex functions are passed to the
invoking complex function. The return code is used by the
TestRc command. Please refer to the commands&rsquo;
description <br>
for examples. The return code can also be accessed through
the variable $[cond.rc]. Non conditional commands do not
modify the return code of the last conditional <br>
command. Important note: return codes are only defined
inside functions created with the AddToFunc command and are
not inherited by sub functions. To run a command <br>
without altering the return code, the KeepRc command can be
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Ring of Windows <br>
Fvwm stores windows in a ring internally. Think of the
focused window as a cursor on the current position in the
ring. The Next command and many other commands search <br>
forwards through the ring for a matching window, and Prev
searches backwards. The windows in the ring are either
ordered by creation time (if the <br>
!FPSortWindowlistByFocus, NeverFocus or MouseFocus styles
are used) or by the last time they had the focus.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">List of Conditional Commands
<br>
All [options] [(conditions)] command <br>
Execute command on all windows meeting the conditions. It
returns 1 if any window matches the condition and 0
otherwise. The execution starts at the top of the <br>
window ring and continues towards the bottom. The options
can be any combination of Reverse and UseStack. If the
option Reverse is given the execution order is <br>
reversed. The option UseStack makes All use the stacking
order instead of the window ring when walking through
windows. See the Conditions section for a list of <br>
conditions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command implies the
conditions CirculateHit, CirculateHitIcon and
CirculateHitShaded. They can be turned off by specifying
!CirculateHit etc. explicitly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any [(conditions)] command <br>
Performs command if any window which satisfies all
conditions exists. The command is run in the context of the
root window. See the Conditions section for a list <br>
of conditions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Break [levels] <br>
If the break command is used in a function, function
execution is terminated immediately. Further commands of the
function are not processed. Normally, all nested <br>
invocations of complex functions are left. An optional
integer number levels may be given to break out of the given
number of nested functions and continue <br>
execution of a higher level function. The Break command
always has the return code -2. Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AddToFunc
PickWindowRaiseAndDeiconify <br>
+ I Pick <br>
+ I TestRc (Error) Break <br>
+ I Raise <br>
+ I Iconify off</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Current [(conditions)] command
<br>
Performs command on the currently focused window if it
satisfies all conditions. See the Conditions section for a
list of conditions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command implies the
conditions CirculateHit, CirculateHitIcon and
CirculateHitShaded. They can be turned off by specifying
!CirculateHit etc. explicitly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Direction [FromPointer]
direction [(conditions)] command <br>
Performs command (typically Focus) on a window in the given
direction which satisfies all conditions. Normally, the
center of the currently focused window or the <br>
context window in which the command was invoked is taken as
the starting point. Lacking such a window, or when the
FromPointer option is given, the current <br>
position of the pointer is taken as the starting point. The
direction may be one of &quot;North&quot;,
&quot;Northeast&quot;, &quot;East&quot;,
&quot;Southeast&quot;, &quot;South&quot;,
&quot;Southwest&quot;, &quot;West&quot;, <br>
&quot;Northwest&quot; and &quot;Center&quot;. Which window
Direction selects depends on angle and distance between the
center points of the windows. Closer windows are considered
a <br>
better match than those farther away. The Center direction
simply selects the window closest to the starting point.
Returns -1 if an invalid direction was given. <br>
See the Conditions section for a list of conditions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KeepRc command <br>
Runs the command but does not alter the return code of the
previous command. Note: KeepRc is treated as a prefix to its
command. Expansion of the command line is <br>
done as if KeepRc was not there.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Next [(conditions)] command <br>
Performs command (typically Focus) on the next window which
satisfies all conditions. If the command is running in a
window context, it starts looking for a <br>
matching window from there. Otherwise it starts at the
focused window. See Conditions section for a list of
conditions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">None [(conditions)] command <br>
Performs command if no window which satisfies all conditions
exists. The command is run in the context of the root
window. Returns 1 if no window matches the <br>
conditions and 0 otherwise. See Conditions section for a
list of conditions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command implies the
conditions CirculateHit, CirculateHitIcon and
CirculateHitShaded. They can be turned off by specifying
!CirculateHit etc. explicitly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NoWindow command <br>
Performs command, but removes the window context if any.
This is not really a conditional command, but a prefix that
may be useful in menu items that should <br>
operate without a window even if such menu is bound to
window decorations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pick [(conditions)] command <br>
Pick works like Function if invoked in the context of a
window. If invoked in the root window, it first asks the
user to pick a window and then executes the <br>
command in the context of that window. This avoids annoying
multiple selections with complex functions. The command is
executed only if the given conditions are <br>
met. Returns -1 if no window was selected. See Conditions
section for a list of conditions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command implies the
conditions CirculateHit, CirculateHitIcon and
CirculateHitShaded. They can be turned off by specifying
!CirculateHit etc. explicitly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PointerWindow [(conditions)]
command <br>
Performs command if the window under the pointer satisfies
all conditions. Returns -1 if there is no window under the
pointer. See Conditions section for a list <br>
of conditions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command implies the
conditions CirculateHit, CirculateHitIcon and
CirculateHitShaded. They can be turned off by specifying
!CirculateHit etc. explicitly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Prev [(conditions)] command <br>
Performs command (typically Focus) on the previous window
which satisfies all conditions. If the command is running in
a window context, it starts looking for a <br>
matching window from there. Otherwise it starts at the
focused window. See Conditions section for a list of
conditions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ScanForWindow [FromPointer] dir1
dir2 [(conditions)] command <br>
Performs command (typically Focus) on a window in the given
direction which satisfies all conditions. Normally, the
center of the currently focused window or the <br>
context window in which the command was invoked is taken as
the starting point. Lacking such a window, or when the
FromPointer option is given, the current <br>
position of the pointer is taken as the starting point. The
direction dir1 may be one of &quot;North&quot;,
&quot;NorthEast&quot;, &quot;East&quot;,
&quot;SouthEast&quot;, &quot;South&quot;,
&quot;SouthWest&quot;, &quot;West&quot;, <br>
and &quot;NorthWest&quot;. Which window ScanForWindow
selects depends first on the position along the primary axis
given by dir1. If any windows have the exact same <br>
coordinate along the primary axis, the secondary direction
is used to order the windows. The direction dir2 may be one
of the same set of values as dir1. If dir2 <br>
is not perfectly perpendicular to dir1, ScanForWindow
returns a failure. When using ScanForWindow repeatedly with
the same arguments, it is guaranteed that all <br>
windows matching the conditions will eventually be found. If
the focus reaches a limit along the primary axis, it will
wrap around to the opposite side. Returns <br>
-1 if an invalid direction was given. See Conditions section
for a list of conditions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Test [(test-conditions)] command
<br>
Performs command if all test-conditions are satisfied. The
test-conditions are keywords with possible arguments from
the list below and are separated by commas or <br>
whitespace. They include: Version operator x.y.z, EnvIsSet
varname, EnvMatch varname pattern, EdgeHasPointer direction,
EdgeIsActive direction, Start, Init, <br>
Restart, Exit, Quit, ToRestart, True, False, F, R, W, X and
I. A test-condition prefixed with &quot;!&quot; is
negated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Version operator x.y.z
test-condition is fulfilled if the logical condition of the
expression is true. Valid operator values are: &gt;=, &gt;,
&lt;=, &lt;, == and !=.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Test (Version &gt;= 2.5.11) Echo
2.5.11 or later.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The EnvIsSet varname
test-condition is true if the given environment variable is
set. The EnvMatch varname pattern test-condition is true if
pattern matches the <br>
given environment or infostore variable value. (See
InfoStoreAdd). The pattern may contain special &quot;*&quot;
and &quot;?&quot; chars. The &quot;varname&quot; is coded
without the leading <br>
dollar sign ($).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The EdgeHasPointer [direction]
test-condition is true if the edge in the given direction
currently contains the pointer. The EdgeIsActive [direction]
<br>
test-condition is true if the edge in the given direction
currently is active. An edge is active, and can contain a
pointer if either a command is bound to it or <br>
edge scroll is available in that direction. The direction
may be one of <br>
Any, North, Top, Up, West, Left, South, Bottom, <br>
Down, Right and East. If no direction is specified Any is
assumed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Start test-condition is the
same as either Init or Restart. It is only true on startup
or restart prior and during StartFunction execution. The
Exit <br>
test-condition is the same as either Quit or ToRestart. It
is only valid on shutdown during ExitFunction function
execution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The True and False
test-conditions are unconditionally true and false.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Additionally, if a
test-condition name is not recognized, the Error return code
is set and the command is not executed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The F file, R file, W file, X
file and I file test-conditions test for existence of the
given [F]ile (possibly with [R]ead/[W]rite permissions),
e[X]ecutable (in <br>
$PATH), or the [I]mage (in ImagePath).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AddToFunc StartFunction I Test
(Init) Exec exec xterm</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AddToFunc VerifyVersion <br>
+ I Test (Version 2.5.*) Echo 2.5.x detected <br>
+ I TestRc (NoMatch) Test (!Version 2.6.*) Echo Future

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Test (F
$[FVWM_USERDIR]/local-config) Read local-config <br>
Test (X xterm-utf16) Exec exec xterm-utf16</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TestRc [([!]returncode)] command
<br>
Performs command if the last conditional command returned
the value returncode. Instead of the numeric values 0 (no
match), 1 (match), -1 (error), and -2 (break) <br>
the symbolic names &quot;NoMatch&quot;, &quot;Match&quot;,
&quot;Error&quot; and &quot;Break&quot; can be used. If no
returncode is given, the default 0 is assumed. If the return
code is prefixed with <br>
&rsquo;!&rsquo;, the command is executed if returncode does
not match the value returned by the conditional command. The
TestRc command can only be used inside functions. If <br>
the command is another conditional command, the previous
return code is replaced by the new one. Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AddToFunc ToggleXterm <br>
+ I All (my_xtermwindow) Close <br>
+ I TestRc (NoMatch) Exec xterm -T my_xtermwindow</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ThisWindow [(conditions)]
command <br>
ThisWindow executes the specified command in the context of
the current operand window. If there is no operand window
(it is invoked in the root window), the <br>
command is ignored. ThisWindow is never interactive. The
command is executed only if the given conditions are met. It
returns -1 if used outside a window <br>
context. See Conditions section for a list of
conditions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command implies the
conditions CirculateHit, CirculateHitIcon and
CirculateHitShaded. They can be turned off by specifying
&quot;!CirculateHit&quot; etc. explicitly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WindowId [id] [(conditions)] |
[root [screen]] command <br>
The WindowId command looks for a specific window id and runs
the specified command on it. The second form of syntax
retrieves the window id of the root window of <br>
the given screen. If no screen is given, the current screen
is assumed. The window indicated by id may belong to a
window not managed by fvwm or even a window on <br>
a different screen. Although most commands can not operate
on such windows, there are some exceptions, for example the
WarpToWindow command. Returns -1 if no <br>
window with the given id exists. See Conditions section for
a list of conditions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command implies the
conditions CirculateHit, CirculateHitIcon and
CirculateHitShaded. They can be turned off by specifying
!CirculateHit etc. explicitly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WindowId 0x34567890 Raise <br>
WindowId root 1 WarpToWindow 50 50 <br>
WindowId $0 (Silly_Popup) Delete</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the past this command was
mostly useful for functions used with the WindowList
command, or for selective processing of FvwmEvent calls (as
in the last example), <br>
but currently these handler functions are called within a
window context, so this command is not really needed in
these cases. Still it may be useful if, for <br>
example, the window id should be stored in the environment
variable for a further proceeding.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pick SetEnv BOOKMARKED_WINDOW
$[w.id] <br>
WindowId $[BOOKMARKED_WINDOW] WarpToWindow</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Conditions <br>
The conditions that may be given as an argument to any
conditional command are a list of keywords separated by
commas, enclosed in parentheses. Unless stated otherwise,
<br>
conditional commands accept all the conditions listed below.
Note that earlier versions of fvwm required the conditions
to be separated by whitespace instead of commas <br>
and enclosed in brackets instead of parentheses (this is
still supported for backward compatibility).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition, the conditions may
include one or more window names to match to. If more than
one window name is given, all of them must match. The window
name, icon name, <br>
class, and resource are considered when attempting to find a
match. Each name may include the wildcards &rsquo;*&rsquo;
and &rsquo;?&rsquo;, and may consist of two or more
alternatives, <br>
separated by the character &rsquo;|&rsquo;, which acts as an
OR operator. (If OR operators are used, they must not be
separated by spaces from the names.) Each window name can
begin <br>
with &rsquo;!&rsquo;, which prevents command if any of the
window name, icon name, class or resource match. However,
&rsquo;!&rsquo; must not be applied to individual names in a
group separated <br>
by OR operators; it may only be applied to the beginning of
the group, and then it operates on the whole group.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Next

browsers is being used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Next (&quot;Mozilla*&quot;,

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This goes to Mozilla&rsquo;s

other browsers&rsquo; bookmark windows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All (&quot;XTerm|rxvt&quot;,
!console) Iconify</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This iconifies all the xterm and
rxvt windows on the current page, except that the one named
&quot;console&quot; (with the -name option to xterm) is
excluded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Next

Next (!FvwmPager, !FvwmForm*, !FvwmButtons) Raise</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These two commands are
equivalent; either one raises the next window which is not
one of the named fvwm modules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any condition can be negated by
using a an exclamation mark (&rsquo;!&rsquo;) directly in
front of its name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The AcceptsFocus condition
excludes all windows that do not want the input focus (the
application has set the &quot;Input hints&quot; for the
window to False) and do not use the <br>
Lenience option of the Style command. Also, all windows
using the NeverFocus style are ignored. Note: !Lenience is
equivalent to the deprecated option NoLenience.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With the AnyScreen condition
used together with any of the Current... conditions, windows
that do not intersect the Xinerama screen containing the
mouse pointer are <br>
considered for a match too. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Focus next window on current
page, <br>
# regardless of Xinerama screen <br>
Next (CurrentPage, AnyScreen) Focus</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The CirculateHit and
CirculateHitIcon options override the CirculateSkip and
CirculateSkipIcon Style attributes for normal or iconic
windows. The CirculateHitShaded <br>
option overrides the CirculateSkipShaded Style. All three
options are turned on by default for the Current command.
They can be turned off by specifying !CirculateHit <br>
etc. explicitly. Note: Do not confuse these conditions with
the style options of the same name. Specifically,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Style foo CirculateSkip <br>
Next (foo, CirculateHit) ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">is not the same as</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Style foo CirculateHit ... <br>
Next (foo)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The prior selects windows with
the name foo only in the Next command. In the second
example, these windows are always matched in all conditional
commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Closable condition matches
only windows that are allowed to be closed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The CurrentDesk condition
matches only windows that are on the current desk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The CurrentGlobalPage condition
matches only windows that are on the current page of the
current desk, regardless of whether Xinerama support is
enabled or not. This <br>
condition implicitly activates the CurrentDesk
condition.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The CurrentGlobalPageAnyDesk
condition matches only windows that are on the current page
of any desk, regardless of whether Xinerama support is
enabled or not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The CurrentPage condition
matches only windows that are on the current page of the
current desk. If Xinerama support is enabled, it only
matches windows that are at least <br>
partially on the Xinerama screen containing the mouse
pointer. This condition implicitly activates the CurrentDesk
condition.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The CurrentPageAnyDesk and
CurrentScreen conditions matches only windows that are on
the current page of any desk. If Xinerama support is
enabled, they only match windows <br>
that are at least partially on the Xinerama screen
containing the mouse pointer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Screen [n] condition matches
only windows which are on the specified Xinerama screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Desk [n] condition matches
only windows which are on the specified desk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The FixedPosition condition
excludes all windows that do not have a fixed position,
either set through WM hints or the Style option
FixedPosition. Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DestroyFunc ToggleFixedGeometry
<br>
AddToFunc ToggleFixedGeometry <br>
+ I Pick (FixedPosition) WindowStyle VariablePosition,
VariableSize <br>
+ I TestRc (NoMatch) WindowStyle FixedPosition,
FixedSize</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The FixedSize condition excludes
all windows that do not have a fixed size, either set
through WM hints or the Style option FixedSize.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Focused matches on the
window that currently has the keyboard focus. This is not
useful for the Current command but can be used with the
other conditional commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The HasHandles condition
excludes all windows that do not have resize handles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The HasPointer condition
excludes all windows that do not contain the pointer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Iconic condition matches
only iconic windows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Iconifiable condition
matches only windows that are allowed to be iconified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Layer [n] condition matches
only windows on the specified layer. The optional argument
of the Layer condition defaults to the layer of the focused
window. The <br>
negation !Layer switches off the Layer condition.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Maximizable condition
matches only windows that are allowed to be maximized.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Maximized condition matches
only maximized windows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Overlapped condition matches
only windows that are overlapped by other windows on the
same layer (or unmanaged windows if the option
RaiseOverUnmanaged of the BugOpts <br>
command is used). Note that this condition can be slow if
you have many windows or if RaiseOverUnmanaged is used and
the connection to the X server is slow.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The PlacedByButton n condition
is fulfilled if the last interactive motion of the window
(with the Move command or as ManualPlacement) was ended by
pressing mouse button <br>
n. Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mouse 1 T A Function
MoveWindow</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DestroyFunc MoveWindow <br>
AddToFunc MoveWindow <br>
+ C Move <br>
+ C ThisWindow (PlacedByButton 5) WindowShade off <br>
+ C TestRc (Match) Maximize on 0 100 <br>
+ C ThisWindow (PlacedByButton 4) WindowShade on</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The PlacedByButton3 condition
has the same meaning as PlacedByButton 3. It remains only
for backward compatibility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The PlacedByFvwm condition
excludes all windows that have been placed manually or by
using the user or program position hint.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Raised conditions matches
only windows that are fully visible on the current viewport
and not overlapped by any other window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Shaded conditions matches
only shaded windows (see WindowShade command).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The State n or !State n
conditions match only windows with the specified integer
state set (or unset). See the State command for details. The
argument may range from 0 <br>
to 31.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Sticky, StickyAcrossDesks
and StickyAcrossPages match only windows that are currently
sticky, sticky across all desks or sticky across all pages.
Please refer to the <br>
Style options with the same name and the commands Stick,
StickAcrossDesks and StickAcrossPages for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The StickyIcon,
StickyAcrossDesksIcon and StickyAcrossPagesIcon match only
windows that become sticky, sticky across all desks or
sticky across all pages when they are in <br>
iconified state.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Transient condition matches
only windows that have the &quot;transient&quot; property
set by the application. This it usually the case for
application popup menus and dialogs. <br>
The FvwmIdent module can be used to find out whether a
specific window is transient.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Visible condition matches
only windows that are at least partially visible on the
current viewport and not completely overlapped by other
windows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Module Commands <br>
Fvwm maintains a database of module configuration lines in a
form</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*&lt;ModuleName&gt;:
&lt;Config-Resource&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where &lt;ModuleName&gt; is
either a real module name or an alias.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This database is initially
filled from config file (or from output of -cmd config
command), and can be later modified either by user (via
FvwmCommand) or by modules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When modules are run, they read
appropriate portion of database. (The concept of this
database is similar to one used in X resource database).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Commands for manipulating module
configuration database are described below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* module_config_line <br>
Defines a module configuration. module_config_line consists
of a module name (or a module alias) and a module resource
line. The new syntax allows a delimiter, a colon <br>
and optional spaces, between the module name and the rest of
the line, this is recommended to avoid conflicts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmIconBox: MaxIconSize 48x48
<br>
*FvwmPager: WindowBorderWidth 1 <br>
*FvwmButtons-TopRight: Geometry 100x100-0+0 <br>
*FvwmButtons-Bottom: Geometry +0-0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DestroyModuleConfig
module_config <br>
Deletes module configuration entries, so that new
configuration lines may be entered instead. This also
sometimes the only way to turn back some module settings,
<br>
previously defined. This changes the way a module runs
during a fvwm session without restarting. Wildcards can be
used for portions of the name as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The new non-conflicting syntax
allows a delimiter, a colon and optional spaces between the
module name and the rest of the line. In this case a module
name (or alias) <br>
can&rsquo;t have wildcards.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DestroyModuleConfig FvwmButtons*
<br>
DestroyModuleConfig FvwmForm: Fore <br>
DestroyModuleConfig FvwmIconBox: Max*</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KillModule modulename
[modulealias] <br>
Causes the module which was invoked with name modulename to
be killed. The name may include wildcards. If modulealias is
given, only modules started with the given alias <br>
are killed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># kill all pagers <br>
KillModule FvwmPager</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Module FvwmEvent SoundEvent <br>
KillModule FvwmEvent SoundEvent</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Module modulename [moduleparams]
<br>
Specifies a module with its optional parameters which should
be spawned. Currently several modules, including
FvwmButtons, FvwmEvent, FvwmForm, FvwmGtk, FvwmPager, <br>
FvwmScript support aliases. Aliases are useful if more than
one instance of the module should be spawned. Aliases may be
configured separately using * syntax. To start <br>
a module FvwmForm using an alias MyForm, the following
syntax may be used:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Module FvwmForm MyForm</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At the current time the
available modules (included with fvwm) are FvwmAnimate
(produces animation effects when a window is iconified or
de-iconified), FvwmAuto (an auto <br>
raise module), FvwmBacker (to change the background when you
change desktops), FvwmBanner (to display a spiffy XBM, XPM,
PNG or SVG), FvwmButtons (brings up a customizable <br>
tool bar), FvwmCommandS (a command server to use with
shell&rsquo;s FvwmCommand client), FvwmConsole (to execute
fvwm commands directly), FvwmCpp (to preprocess your config
with <br>
cpp), FvwmDebug (to help debug fvwm), FvwmDragWell (the
place to drag&amp;drop to), FvwmEvent (trigger various
actions by events), FvwmForm (to bring up dialogs), FvwmGtk
(to <br>
bring up GTK menus and dialogs), FvwmIconBox (like the mwm
IconBox), FvwmIconMan (a flexible icon manager), FvwmIdent
(to get window info), FvwmM4 (to preprocess your <br>
config with m4), FvwmPager (a mini version of the desktop),
FvwmPerl (a Perl manipulator and preprocessor), FvwmProxy
(to locate and control obscured windows by using <br>
small proxy windows), FvwmRearrange (to rearrange windows),
FvwmSave (saves the desktop state in .xinitrc style),
FvwmSaveDesk (saves the desktop state in fvwm commands),
<br>
FvwmScript (another powerful dialog toolkit), FvwmScroll
(puts scrollbars on any window), FvwmTabs (a generic tabbing
module), FvwmTaskBar (a Windows like task bar), <br>
FvwmTheme (managed colorsets, obsolete), FvwmWharf (an
AfterStep like button bar), FvwmWindowMenu (a configurable
fvwm menu listing current windows), FvwmWinList (a window
<br>
list). These modules have their own man pages. There may be
other modules out on there as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Modules can be short lived
transient programs or, like FvwmButtons , can remain for the
duration of the X session. Modules are terminated by the
window manager prior to <br>
restarts and quits, if possible. See the introductory
section on modules. The keyword Module may be omitted if
modulename is distinct from all fvwm commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ModuleListenOnly modulename
[moduleparams] <br>
This command works like the Module command, but fvwm never
sends any messages to the module. This may be handy to write
a module as a shell script that is triggered by <br>
external events without the burden to answer packets sent by
fvwm. For example, a module written as a shell script may
change labels of the FvwmButtons module to <br>
implement a simple clock.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ModulePath path <br>
Specifies a colon separated list of directories in which to
search for modules. To find a module, fvwm searches each
directory in turn and uses the first file found. <br>
Directory names on the list do not need trailing
slashes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ModulePath may contain
environment variables such as $HOME (or ${HOME}). Further, a
&rsquo;+&rsquo; in the path is expanded to the previous
value of the path, allowing easy <br>
appending or prepending to the path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ModulePath
${HOME}/lib/fvwm/modules:+</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The directory containing the
standard modules is available via the environment variable
$FVWM_MODULEDIR.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ModuleSynchronous [Expect
string] [Timeout secs] modulename <br>
The ModuleSynchronous command is very similar to Module.
Fvwm stops processing any commands and user input until the
module sends a string beginning with &quot;NOP FINISHED <br>
STARTUP&quot; back to fvwm. If the optional Timeout is given
fvwm gives up if the module sent no input back to fvwm for
secs seconds. If the Expect option is given, fvwm <br>
waits for the given string instead. ModuleSynchronous should
only be used during fvwm startup to enforce the order in
which modules are started. This command is intended <br>
for use with the (currently hypothetical) module that should
be in place before other modules are started.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning: It is quite easy to
hang fvwm with this command, even if a timeout is given. Be
extra careful choosing the string to wait for. Although all
modules in the fvwm <br>
distribution send back the &quot;NOP FINISHED STARTUP&quot;
string once they have properly started up, this may not be
the case for third party modules. Moreover, you can try to
<br>
escape from a locked ModuleSynchronous command by using the
key sequence Ctrl-Alt-Escape (see the EscapeFunc).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ModuleTimeout timeout <br>
Specifies how many seconds fvwm waits for a module to
respond. If the module does not respond within the time
limit then fvwm kills it. timeout must be greater than <br>
zero, or it is reset to the default value of 30 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SendToModule modulename string
<br>
Sends an arbitrary string (no quotes required) to all
modules, whose alias or name matching modulename, which may
contain wildcards. This only makes sense if the module <br>
is set up to understand and deal with these strings though.
Can be used for module to module communication, or
implementation of more complex commands in modules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Session Management Commands <br>
Quit <br>
Exits fvwm, generally causing X to exit too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">QuitScreen <br>
Causes fvwm to stop managing the screen on which the command
was issued.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Restart [window_manager
[params]] <br>
Causes fvwm to restart itself if window_manager is left
blank, or to switch to an alternate window manager (or other
fvwm version) if window_manager is specified. If the <br>
window manager is not in your default search path, then you
should use the full path name for window_manager.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command should not have a
trailing ampersand. The command can have optional parameters
with simple shell-like syntax. You can use ~ (is expanded to
the user&rsquo;s home <br>
directory) and environmental variables $VAR or ${VAR}. Here
are several examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Key F1 R N Restart <br>
Key F1 R N Restart fvwm -s <br>
Key F1 R N Restart ~/bin/fvwm -f $HOME/.fvwm/main <br>
Key F1 R N Restart fvwm1 -s -f .fvwmrc <br>
Key F1 R N Restart xterm -n &rsquo;&quot;X
console&quot;&rsquo; -T</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you need a native restart, we
suggest only to use Restart command without parameters
unless there is a reason not to. If you still use an old
command &rsquo;Restart fvwm2&rsquo; <br>
that was correct in 2.2.x, all current command line
arguments are lost. On a restart without parameters or with
--pass-args, they are preserved. Here are some cases when
<br>
&rsquo;Restart fvwm2&rsquo; or &rsquo;Restart fvwm&rsquo;
cause troubles:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* running fvwm under a session
manager <br>
* running fvwm with multi headed displays <br>
* having command line arguments, like <br>
-f themes-rc or -cmd <br>
* if the first fvwm2 in the $PATH is a <br>
different one</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is why we are issuing a
warning on an old usage. If you really want to restart to
fvwm with no additional arguments, you may get rid of this
warning by using <br>
&quot;Restart fvwm -s&quot; or &quot;Restart
/full/path/fvwm&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note, currently with multi
headed displays, restart of fvwms on different screens works
independently.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Restart --pass-args
window_manager <br>
The same as Restart without parameters but the name for the
current window manager is replaced with the specified
window_manager and original arguments are preserved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command is useful if you
use initial arguments like</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-cmd FvwmCpp</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and want to switch to another
fvwm version without losing the initial arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Restart --dont-preserve-state
[other-params] <br>
The same as</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Restart [other-params]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">but it does not save any window
states over the restart.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Without this option, Restart
preserves most per-window state by writing it to a file
named .fs-restart-$HOSTDISPLAY in the user&rsquo;s home
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SaveSession <br>
Causes a session manager (if any) to save the session. This
command does not work for xsm, it seems that xsm does not
implement this functionality. Use Unix signals to <br>
manage xsm remotely.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SaveQuitSession <br>
Causes a session manager (if any) to save and then shutdown
the session. This command does not work for xsm, it seems
that xsm does not implement this functionality. Use <br>
Unix signals to manage xsm remotely.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Colorsets <br>
Colorsets are a powerful method to control colors. Colorsets
create appearance resources that are shared by fvwm and its
modules. When a colorset is modified all parts of fvwm <br>
react to that change. A colorset includes a foreground
color, background color, shadow and highlight color (often
based on the background color), background face (this
includes <br>
images and all kinds of gradients). There is a way to render
background face and specify other color operations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the 2.4.x versions a special
module FvwmTheme was introduced to manage colorsets.
Starting with the 2.5.x beta version, the FvwmTheme
functionality was moved to the core <br>
fvwm, so this module became obsolete.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The old syntax:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DestroyModuleConfig FvwmTheme: *
<br>
*FvwmTheme: Colorset 0 fg black, bg rgb:b4/aa/94 <br>
*FvwmTheme: Colorset 1 fg black, bg rgb:a1/b2/c8</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">corresponds to the new
syntax:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CleanupColorsets <br>
Colorset 0 fg black, bg rgb:b4/aa/94 <br>
Colorset 1 fg black, bg rgb:a1/b2/c8</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Colorset num [options] <br>
Creates or modifies colorset num. Colorsets are identified
by this number. The number can start at zero and can be a
very large number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning: The highest colorset
number used determines memory consumption. Thus, if you
define &rsquo;Colorset 100000&rsquo;, the memory for 100001
colorsets is used. Keep your <br>
colorset numbers as small as possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By convention, colorsets are
numbered like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># 0 = Default colors <br>
# 1 = Inactive windows <br>
# 2 = Active windows <br>
# 3 = Inactive menu entry and menu background <br>
# 4 = Active menu entry <br>
# 5 = greyed out menu entry (only bg used) <br>
# 6 = module foreground and background <br>
# 7 = hilight colors</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you need to have more colors
and do not want to reinvent the wheel, you may use the
convention used in fvwm-themes, it defines the meaning of
the first 40 colorsets for <br>
nearly all purposes:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">http://fvwm-themes.sourceforge.net/doc/colorsets</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each colorset has four colors,
an optional pixmap and an optional shape mask. The four
colors are used by modules as the foreground, background,
highlight and shadow <br>
colors. When a colorset is created it defaults to a
foreground of black and background of gray. The background
and foreground are marked as &quot;average&quot; and
&quot;contrast&quot; (see <br>
later) so that just specifying a pixmap or gradient gives
sensible results.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">options is a comma separated
list containing some of the keywords: fg, Fore, Foreground,
bg, Back, Background, hi, Hilite, Hilight, sh, Shade,
Shadow, fgsh, Pixmap, <br>
TiledPixmap, AspectPixmap, Transparent, RootTransparent,
Shape, TiledShape, AspectShape, NoShape, ?Gradient, Tint,
fgTint, bgTint, Alpha, fgAlpha, Dither, NoDither, <br>
IconTint, IconAlpha, Plain.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fg, Fore and Foreground take a
color name as an argument and set the foreground color. The
special name Contrast may be used to select a color that
contrasts well with <br>
the background color. To reset the foreground color to the
default value you can simply omit the color name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bg, Back and Background take a
color name as an argument and set the background color. It
also sets the highlight and shadow colors to values that
give a 3d effect unless <br>
these have been explicitly set with the options below. The
special name Average may be used to select a color that is
the average color of the pixmap. If the pixmap is <br>
tinted with the Tint option, the tint is not taken in
account in the computation of the average color. You should
use the bgTint option to get the &quot;real&quot; average
color. <br>
The background color is reset to the default value if the
color name is omitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hi, Hilite and Hilight take a
color name as an argument and set the highlight color. If
the highlight color is not explicitly set, the default is to
calculate it from the <br>
background color. To switch back to the default behavior the
color name can be omitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sh, Shade and Shadow take a
color name as an argument and set the shadow color. If the
shadow color is not explicitly set, the default is to
calculate it from the <br>
background color. To switch back to the default behavior the
color name can be omitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fgsh takes a color name as an
argument and sets the color used by the shadowing font
effect. See the Font Shadow Effects section of the fvwm man
page. By default this <br>
color is computed from the foreground and background colors.
To switch back to the default the color name can be
omitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pixmap, TiledPixmap and
AspectPixmap take a file name as an argument, search the
ImagePath and use it as the background pixmap. Any
transparent parts are filled with the <br>
background color. Not specifying a file name removes any
existing image from the colorset. TiledPixmap produces
repeated copies of the image with no scaling, Pixmap <br>
causes the image to be stretched to fit whatever object the
colorset is applied to and AspectPixmap stretches to fit but
retains the image aspect ratio.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Transparent creates a
transparent background pixmap. The pixmap is used as a
window background to achieve root transparency. For this you
should use the <br>
ParentalRelativity option to the Style command. A subsequent
root background change may be detected or not, this depends
on the program used to set the background. If <br>
you use fvwm-root, xsetbg (xli), FvwmBacker with solid or
colorset colors or a recent version of Esetroot (&gt;= 9.2)
a background change is detected. If background changes <br>
are not detected (e.g., if you use xv or xsetroot) you can
force detection by using the -d option of fvwm-root:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xv -root -quit mybg.png;
fvwm-root -d</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Due to the way X implements
transparency no guarantees can be made that the desired
effect can be achieved. The application may even crash. If
you experience any <br>
problems with this option, do not use it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using outline move and resize
(see the OpaqueMoveSize command and the ResizeOpaque Style
option) as well as setting the WindowShadeShrinks style may
help. The <br>
transparency achieved with Transparent depends on whether
the colorset is applied to the foreground or the background
of a window. In the second case the transparency is <br>
relative to the parent window of the window on which the
colorset is defined. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Colorset 12 VGradient 200 grey30
grey60 <br>
Colorset 17 Transparent <br>
*FvwmIconMan: Colorset 12 <br>
*FvwmIconMan: PlainColorset 17</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gives an IconMan with a vertical
grey gradient background and the buttons use the background
(by transparency). To obtain a (root) transparent
IconMan:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Colorset 12 Transparent <br>
Colorset 17 Transparent <br>
Colorset 18 Transparent <br>
Colorset 19 Transparent</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmIconMan: Colorset 12 <br>
*FvwmIconMan: PlainColorset 17 <br>
*FvwmIconMan: FocusColorset 18 <br>
*FvwmIconMan: IconColorset 19</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Colorset IconMan option
defines the IconMan window background, but the PlainColorset
and the FocusColorset are drawn on the foreground. So, the
transparency of the <br>
IconMan buttons is achieved by drawing nothing. Now if this
IconMan is swallowed in an FvwmButtons as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FvwmButtons:(Colorset 10,
Swallow &quot;FvwmIconMan&quot;
&rsquo;FvwmIconMan&rsquo;)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">then, FvwmIconMan becomes a
child of FvwmButtons and it is transparent relative to
FvwmButtons. So, in this case FvwmIconMan uses Colorset 10
as background. If you want <br>
root transparency use the RootTransparent option.
FvwmButtons, FvwmIconMan, FvwmIdent, FvwmScroll and
FvwmTaskBar are relatively simple. There is one main
colorset <br>
option which defines the background of the window and the
other colorsets (if any) are drawn on the foreground. The
case of FvwmWinList and FvwmProxy are simpler. With <br>
FvwmWinList all the colorsets are drawn on the foreground
and with FvwmProxy the two colorsets refer to the window
backgrounds. FvwmPager is more complicated as almost <br>
everything in the pager are windows with some parental
relations (the mini windows are the child and the desktops
are the parents and all this is complicated by the <br>
hilighted page). So, the colorsets apply to the background
of these windows. You should experiment. For FvwmForm and
FvwmScript the situation is similar. There is a <br>
main window (a child of the root window) which corresponds
to the main colorset and most of the widgets are windows
which are children of the main window. Tint may work <br>
or not with the Transparent option. When the colorset is
drawn on the foreground Tint should work. In some cases,
tinting may be very slow. Tinting may work with fvwm <br>
menu (without animation). Tinting may work better if your X
server has backing store enabled (try xdpyinfo to see if
this the case). There is a chance that the backing <br>
store support of your X server does not work well with the
terrible hack used to Tint the ParentRelative Pixmap. So, to
get tinted root transparency it is more safe to <br>
use the RootTransparent option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RootTransparent [ buffer ]
creates a root transparent background. To make this option
work, you must use an Esetroot compatible program, fvwm-root
with the <br>
--retain-pixmap option or FvwmBacker with the RetainPixmap
option (and colorset or solid backgrounds). The buffer
keyword is useful only when the Tint option is used too.
<br>
This speeds up creation of windows which use the colorset
(useful for fvwm menus) at the cost of memory usage. It also
speeds up opaque move and resize which can be <br>
unacceptably slow without buffer. However, this option may
add a lot of memory to your X server (depending on the size
of the image used to set the background). In <br>
summary, using outline move and resize for modules which use
such a colorset may be a good idea.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Shape, TiledShape and
AspectShape take a file name as an argument, search the
ImagePath and use it as the shape bitmap. TiledShape
produces repeated copies of the bitmap <br>
with no scaling, Shape causes the bitmap to be stretched to
fit whatever object the colorset is applied to and
AspectShape stretches to fit but retains the bitmap aspect
<br>
ratio. If the file is a pixmap in xpm format the shape mask
(all opaque pixels) of the pixmap is used. For png and svg
images, the shape mask is equivalent to all not <br>
completely transparent pixels (alpha &gt; 0).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning <br>
Due to the way X11 implements shapes you cannot take back
making windows shaped. You may have to restart fvwm or the
shaped application.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">?Gradient ... creates a pixmap
and stretches it to fit the window. ?Gradient may be one of
HGradient, VGradient, DGradient, BGradient, SGradient,
CGradient, RGradient or <br>
YGradient. The gradient types are as follows: H is
horizontal; V is vertical; D is diagonal from top left to
bottom right; B is a backwards diagonal from bottom left to
<br>
top right; S is concentric squares; C is concentric circles;
R is a radar like pattern and Y is a Yin Yang style (but
without the dots). Please refer to the Color <br>
Gradients section for the syntax of gradients.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tint takes 2 arguments, a color
and a percentage between 0 and 100. It causes the image
defined using ?Pixmap or ?Gradient to be tinted with the
specified color using the <br>
percentage. If the image is transparent Tint tints only the
image part. Unfortunately, a colorset background specified
using the Transparent option can give strange <br>
results. See the Transparent option for details. With no
arguments this option removes the tint.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fgTint takes 2 arguments, a
color and a percentage between 0 and 100. It causes the
color defined using fg to be tinted with the specified color
using the percentage. <br>
With no arguments this option removes the tint.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bgTint takes 2 arguments, a
color and a percentage between 0 and 100. It causes the
color defined using bg to be tinted with the specified color
using the percentage. If <br>
the sh and hi colors are not specified, they are recomputed
from the tinted bg color. With no arguments this option
removes the tint.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alpha takes a percentage between
0 and 100 as an argument. It causes fvwm to merge the image
defined using ?Pixmap or ?Gradient with the bg color using
the percentage. <br>
If the percentage is 0 the image is hidden and if it is 100
the image is displayed as usual (no merge). The default is
100 and it is restored if no argument is given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fgAlpha takes a percentage
between 0 and 100 as an argument. It causes fvwm to merge
the text and the colorset background using the percentage.
If the percentage is 0 <br>
the text is hidden and if it is 100 the text is displayed as
usual (no merge). This option has an effect only with fonts
loaded by Xft, see the Font Names and Font <br>
Loading section. The default is 100 and it is restored if no
argument is given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Dither causes fvwm to dither the
image defined using ?Pixmap or ?Gradient. This is useful
only with displays with depth less than or equal to 16
(i.e., on displays which <br>
can only display less than 65537 colors at once). The
dithering effect lets you simulate having more colors
available that you actually have. NoDither causes fvwm to do
<br>
not dither the images. Dither is the default if the depth is
less than or equal to 8 (a screen with 256 colors or less).
In depth 15 (32768 colors) and 16 (65536 <br>
colors), the default is NoDither, however this effect can be
useful with images which contain a lot of close colors. For
example a fine gradient looks more smooth.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IconTint takes 2 arguments, a
color and a percentage between 0 and 100. It causes fvwm or
a module to tint the &quot;icons&quot; which are rendered
into the colorset background <br>
with the specified color using a percentage. Here
&quot;icons&quot; means, fvwm Icons, fvwm menu icons,
MiniIcons which represent applications in various modules,
images loaded by <br>
modules (e.g., images specified by the Icon FvwmButtons
button option) ...etc. With no arguments this option removes
the icon tint.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IconAlpha takes a percentage
between 0 and 100 as an argument. It causes fvwm to merge
the &quot;icons&quot; which are rendered into the colorset
background using this percentage. <br>
The default is 100 and it is restored if no argument is
given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: It is equivalent to use
&quot;Tint a_color rate&quot; and &quot;Alpha a&quot; if a =
100 and the bg color is a_color. This equivalence does not
hold for IconAlpha and IconTint as the <br>
background can be an image or a gradient (and not a uniform
color background). However, in some cases you can achieve
(almost) the same effect by using IconTint in the <br>
place of IconAlpha. This is preferable as, in general,
IconAlpha generates more redrawing than IconTint.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NoShape removes the shape mask
from the colorset while Plain removes the background pixmap
or gradient.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Colorset 3 fg tan, bg navy</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If necessary this creates
colorsets 0, 1, 2 and 3 and then changes colorset 3 to have
a foreground of tan, a background of navy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Colorset 3 bg &quot;navy
blue&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">changes the background color of

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Makes colorset 7 blink.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The color names used in

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Where $[fg.cs0] is the
foreground color of colorset zero. Please refer to the
Command Expansion section for more information.</p>

Resets a definition of all colorsets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Color Gradients <br>
A color gradient is a background that changes its color
gradually from one hue to a different one. Color gradients
can be used by various commands and modules of fvwm. <br>
There are eight types of gradients: HGradient is a
horizontal gradient, VGradient is vertical, DGradient is
diagonal from top left to bottom right, BGradient is
backwards <br>
diagonal from bottom left to top right, SGradient is
concentric squares, CGradient is concentric circles,
RGradient is a radar like pattern and YGradient is a Yin
Yang <br>
style (but without the dots).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The color gradient syntax has
two forms:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">?Gradient colors start-color
end-color</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This form specifies a linear
gradient. The arguments denote the total number of colors to
allocate (between 2 and 1000), the initial color and the
final color.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TitleStyle VGradient 20
rgb:b8/ce/bc rgb:5b/85/d0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">?Gradient colors segments color
length color [length color] ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The second form specifies a
nonlinear gradient. The arguments are: the total number of
colors to allocate (between 2 and 1000), then the number of
segments. For each <br>
segment, specify the starting color, a relative length, then
the ending color. Each subsequent segment begins with the
second color of the last segment. The lengths may <br>
be any non-negative integers. The length of one segment
divided by the sum of all segments lengths is the fraction
of the colors that are used for the segment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MenuStyle * MenuFace DGradient
128 2 lightgrey 50 blue 50 white</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># 20% gradient from red to blue,

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
The environment variables that have an effect on how fvwm
operates are the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DISPLAY <br>
Fvwm starts on this display unless the -display option is
given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FVWM_MODULEDIR <br>
Set by fvwm to the directory containing the standard fvwm
modules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FVWM_USERDIR <br>
Used to determine the user&rsquo;s data directory for
reading and sometimes writing personal files. If this
variable is not already set, it is set by fvwm to
$HOME/.fvwm, which is <br>
the default user&rsquo;s data directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SESSION_MANAGER <br>
Fvwm tries to contact this session manager.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SESSION_MANAGER_NAME <br>
This is used mainly to determine xsm running to work around
its bug. If this variable is set to &quot;xsm&quot;,
DiscardCommand is set as xsm expects it and not as XSMP
requires. If <br>
you run fvwm under xsm, you should set this variable to
&quot;xsm&quot;, otherwise old state files are not
removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SM_SAVE_DIR <br>
If this is set, fvwm saves its session data in this
directory. Otherwise it uses $HOME. Note, the state files
are named .fs-?????? and normally are removed automatically
<br>
when not used anymore.</p>
