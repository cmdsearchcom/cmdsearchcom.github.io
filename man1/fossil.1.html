fossil COMMAND [OPTIONS]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Fossil is a distributed version control system (DVCS) with
built-in wiki, ticket tracker, CGI/http interface, and http
server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Common COMMANDs: <br>

addremove clean help pull sync <br>
all clone import push tag <br>
amend commit info rebuild timeline <br>
annotate delete init remote-url ui <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FEATURES <br>
Features as described on the fossil home page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. Integrated Bug Tracking,
Wiki, &amp; Technotes - In addition to doing distributed
version control like Git and Mercurial, Fossil also supports
bug tracking, wiki, and technotes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Built-in Web Interface -
Fossil has a built-in and intuitive web interface that
promotes project situational awareness. Type &quot;fossil
ui&quot; and Fossil automatically opens a web <br>
browser to a page that shows detailed graphical history and
status information on that project.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. Self-Contained - Fossil is a
single self-contained stand-alone executable. To install,
simply download a precompiled binary for Linux, Mac,
OpenBSD, or Windows and put it on <br>
your $PATH. Easy-to-compile source code is available for
users on other platforms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. Simple Networking - No custom
protocols or TCP ports. Fossil uses plain old HTTP (or HTTPS
or SSH) for all network communications, so it works fine
from behind restrictive <br>
firewalls, including proxies. The protocol is bandwidth
efficient to the point that Fossil can be used comfortably
over dial-up.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5. CGI/SCGI Enabled - No server
is required, but if you want to set one up, Fossil supports
four simple server configurations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6. Autosync - Fossil supports
&quot;autosync&quot; mode which helps to keep projects
moving forward by reducing the amount of needless forking
and merging often associated with distrib&acirc; <br>
uted projects.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">7. Robust &amp; Reliable -
Fossil stores content using an enduring file format in an
SQLite database so that transactions are atomic even if
interrupted by a power loss or system <br>
crash. Automatic self-checks verify that all aspects of the
repository are consistent prior to each commit. In over
seven years of operation, no work has ever been lost <br>
after having been committed to a Fossil repository.</p>
