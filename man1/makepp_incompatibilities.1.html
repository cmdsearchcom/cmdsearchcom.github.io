MAKEPP_INCOMPATIBILITIES(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
makepp_incompatibilities -- Incompatibilities between makepp
and GNU make</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Makepp was designed to be as close as possible to GNU make
(&lt;http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html&gt;).
GNU autotools <br>

(&lt;http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/automake.html&gt;),
CMake (&lt;http://www.cmake.org/&gt;), Premake
(&lt;http://industriousone.com/premake&gt; and see remark
below) or handcrafted <br>
legacy build systems should be buildable with makepp. This
is so you can either migrate projects effortlessly. Or if
you don&rsquo;t want to enjoy all of makepp&rsquo;s
advantages (e.g. so <br>
others can still build your project with GNU make) while you
profit from the reliability advantage for your
development.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, because of the
difference in philosophy, some of GNU make&rsquo;s or POSIX
make&rsquo;s
(&lt;http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/utilities/make.html&gt;)
features cannot be <br>
supported. A few have not been implemented because we
haven&rsquo;t had time. Most of the differences from GNU
make are quite technical and only rarely cause problems.
Alas the <br>
workarounds for the short-comings of traditional make are
becoming more and more complex, and are giving makepp a hard
time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In a nutshell, if it
doesn&rsquo;t build out of the box, try:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">makepp --no-warn
makepp_simple_concatenation=1 makepp_percent_subdirs=1
--build-check=target_newer --last-chance-rules
--no-remake-makefiles</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If that succeeds, you can try to
eliminate those arguments one by one. But if that fails, try
adding:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--traditional-recursive-make</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If that also fails, the build
system needs some tweaking to cooperate with makepp. Even if
some options described here make something buildable, it is
still recommended to adapt <br>
things slightly, so they become compatible out of the box
with both makes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Forcing more POSIX or GNU make
compatibility <br>
Here are some command line possibilities for getting many
legacy build systems to work without modification. They
cause makepp to emulate GNU make&rsquo;s behavior
precisely.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Compatibility via the option:
&quot;--build-check=target_newer&quot; <br>
By default, makepp will attempt to rebuild all targets if
any of the dependencies have changed since the last build,
or if the command has changed (see makepp_build_check for
<br>
details). This is normally what you want. Sometimes,
however, you don&rsquo;t want the target to be rebuilt if it
has been modified apart from the control of makepp (e.g., by
editing <br>
it, or by running a program manually to make the file). You
can force makepp to use the traditional make algorithm,
which only rebuilds if any of the targets are newer than the
<br>
dependencies, by adding this option to the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Compatibility via the option:
&quot;--dont-build=config.status&quot; <br>
There are packages which try to autoconfigure themselves, or
do other things, which gmake ignores unless being asked to,
like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">config.status : configure <br>
./config.status --recheck</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">configure : configure.in
aclocal.m4 <br>
autoconf</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most people don&rsquo;t even
have &quot;autoconf&quot; installed, so conscientiously
doing everything by the rules, as makepp does, will fail.
This option prevents that, if you figure out what <br>
not to build.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Compatibility via the option:
&quot;--last-chance-rules&quot; <br>
Default rules (pattern rules with no pattern dependencies)
are not normally supported. Makepp instantiates all rules
based on the existing files, so that it is aware of every
<br>
file that could be generated. Alas this way it does not know
how to instantiate a pattern rule with no pattern
dependency. The :last_chance mechanism partially remedies
that. <br>
Where this is good enough for legacy makefiles, this option
allows turning it on globally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Compatibility via the option:
&quot;--no-warn&quot; <br>
This one doesn&rsquo;t improve the result. Makepp will give
warning messages for many things which the traditional Unix
make accepts without flinching. This is because there are
<br>
better ways to do them with makepp. If these warnings annoy
you, you can turn them off with this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Compatibility via the option:
&quot;--hybrid-recursive-make&quot; <br>
Recursive invocations of make are often considered to be an
unsafe practice (see &quot;Better system for hierarchical
builds&quot; in makepp for details), but they are extremely
common in <br>
existing makefiles. Makepp supports recursive make for
backward compatibility; for new makefiles, it is much better
to use the &quot;load_makefile&quot; statement, or
makepp&rsquo;s implicit <br>
makefile loading mechanism.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to be able to use
repositories for variant builds, and to help make recursive
invocations of make safer, makepp normally does not actually
invoke itself recursively even <br>
if you tell it to. Instead, a subprocess communicates with
the parent process, and the actual build is done by the
parent process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This works in most cases, but
you may not invoke several makefiles from the same
directory, e.g., the following will not work:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">target: dependencies <br>
$(MAKE) -f other_makefile targets</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In this case makepp notices it
is loading a 2nd makefile and complains. With this option
instead it will fall back to the traditional way of building
from additional makefiles <br>
in a separate makepp process each.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: Technically loading
several makefiles would be no problem, but they usually have
the same phony target names. Keeping that apart would mean a
complete redesign of makepp <br>
internals. However, this will work, but it is not
equivalent:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">target: dependencies <br>
cd subdir &amp;&amp; $(MAKE) -f other_makefile targets</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Compatibility via the option:
&quot;--traditional-recursive-make&quot; <br>
Sometimes the previous option is not enough, especially if
the recursive invocations use contradictory options. Makepp
uses only one set of global options, so a submake is not
<br>
allowed to modify them, as that would also pertain to other
makefiles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Adding this option to the
command line, has the following undesirable side
effects:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Recursive makes
do not internally execute in parallel, even if the parent
does. Unlike gmake there is no overall coordination of the
number of processes. This will not be <br>
implemented because this way of working is not a design goal
of makepp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Recursive make
processes do not know anything about repositories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Each recursive
make process produces its own log file, in the directory it
is invoked in, instead of producing one log file for the
entire build.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Since makepp
usually builds more than traditional make deems necessary,
and since many build systems provide recursive calls in all
directions, this may lead to endless <br>
recursion. Makepp will pull the brake after 50 rounds and
tell you how to increase that, in case you really have such
deep nesting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Even with the
&quot;--traditional-recursive-make&quot; option, the
environment variables &quot;MAKEOVERRIDES&quot; and
&quot;MFLAGS&quot; are not set up, and ignored, so makefiles
that depend on those will <br>
not work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A Premake generated Makefile is
only a funny wrapper to a sub-make invocation in the same
directory. If you have some project target XYZ it will have
a line like</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@${MAKE} --no-print-directory -C
. -f XYZ.make</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In this case you can avoid the
&quot;--traditional-recursive-make&quot; option by directly
invoking makepp with that &quot;-f XYZ.make&quot;
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Compatibility without the
option: &quot;--jobs=n&quot; <br>
Legacy makefiles will sometimes not list all dependencies,
relying on the order of execution to make them in time. In
this situation makepp may manage to call a rule before its
<br>
dependencies have all been made. Then results may be better
with less, or even no parallel execution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Compatibility via the variable:
&quot;makepp_simple_concatenation=1&quot; <br>
Rc-style substitution is the default way makepp performs
variable substitution into text strings because it very
rarely breaks legacy makefiles and is often useful in new
<br>
makefiles. However, it does introduce occasional
incompatibilities in the substitution of variables not
surrounded by spaces. For example,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INCLUDE_PREFIX :=
-I/some/include/dir -I <br>
INCLUDES := $(INCLUDE_PREFIX)/other/include/dir</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will set &quot;INCLUDES&quot; to
&quot;-I/some/include/dir/other/include/dir
-I/other/include/dir&quot; if rc-style substitution is
enabled, whereas GNU make would set it to <br>
&quot;-I/some/include/dir -I/other/include/dir&quot;. E.g.,
when compiling Redis 2.6.5 it tries to run
&quot;printfgcc&quot;. Such a funny concatenation of two
commands is a strong indication that <br>
this variable is needed to fall back to make semantics.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is also an incompatibility
in the handling of whitespace in a variable:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">null := <br>
T := -o $(null) # T contains -o followed by one space. <br>
OUTFILE = $(T)outfile</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will set &quot;OUTFILE&quot; to
&quot;-ooutfile&quot; if rc-style substitution is enabled,
whereas GNU make would set it to &quot;-o outfile&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Both of these incompatibilities
are removed by setting the
&quot;makepp_simple_concatenation&quot; variable. Note,
however, that even with
&quot;makepp_simple_concatenation&quot;, makepp still <br>
treats whitespace incompatibly in some situations:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">T := -o # Don&rsquo;t delete
this comment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GNU make sets &quot;T&quot; to
contain &quot;-o&quot; followed by a space, whereas makepp
strips out the trailing space anyway. If you want the
trailing space, you must set <br>
&quot;makepp_simple_concatenation&quot; and also set
&quot;T&quot; using the technique involving a dummy variable
such as &quot;null&quot;, as shown above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Workaround option
&quot;--no-remake-makefiles&quot; <br>
Typical open source requires calling &quot;configure&quot;
to create the makefiles. But then these makefiles can
contain rules to remake the makefile, by calling some
command. Makepp <br>
will happily comply and update it according to the rule. But
sometimes this is harmful, so just skip it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Compatibility via the variable:
&quot;makepp_percent_subdirs=1&quot; <br>
By default, &quot;%&quot; in a pattern rule does not match
directories. This means that a rule like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%.o: %.c <br>
$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c $(input) -o $(output)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will not be applied to files
like &quot;../shared/xyz.c&quot;. If you want it to match
files in subdirectories too, then set the variable
&quot;makepp_percent_subdirs=1&quot; on the command line or
<br>
near the beginning of a makefile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Compatibility via the
environment variable: $MAKEPP_IGNORE_OPTS <br>
Sometimes legacy recursive invocations pass options that
makepp doesn&rsquo;t understand. Hopefully the option is not
important, but it prevents makepp from running. With this
<br>
environment variable you can ask makepp to silently ignore
certain options. The value shall be a space separated list
of options, which can come in 4 variants:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--long=x <br>
A long option that expects an argument. This fact must be
declared through the equals sign, though the actual use may
also separated by whitespace, either &quot;--long=bla&quot;
or <br>
&quot;--long bla&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--long <br>
A long option without an argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sx A short option that expects
an argument. This fact must be declared by adding something
directly after the option, though the actual use may also
separated by whitespace, <br>
either &quot;-sbla&quot; or &quot;-s bla&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s A short option without an
argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">E.g. override makepp&rsquo;s -R
option by one without an argument and accept gmake&rsquo;s
debug option with an argument:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">export
MAKEPP_IGNORE_OPTS=&rsquo;-R --debug=x&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Incompatibilities that require
Makefile changes <br>
&Acirc;&middot; Makefiles that explicitly call make prevent
makepp from building everything itself. Alas Perl&rsquo;s
own &quot;ExtUtils::MakeMaker&quot; commits the second of
the following two forms of <br>
this mistake up to version 6.56 (Perl 5.12.1):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">subdir: <br>
cd subdir; make</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MAKE = make</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Setting the
&quot;VPATH&quot; variable to some value implicitly calls
&quot;vpath % value&quot;. &quot;vpath&quot; statements are
emulated with the repository mechanism. So, where gmake
substitutes the <br>
path to the file found in the vpath, makepp will instead
link it symbolically to where it is needed. Thus makepp will
provide an unmodified string, which is usually not a <br>
problem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Targets in a vpath are not
supported. (Gmake considers them if they are newer than
their dependencies, but if not, the target will be recreated
in the current directory -- <br>
rather inconsistent.) Unsetting vpaths is not supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A pattern rule
present later in a makefile overrides one that is present
earlier. This is backwards from GNU make.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The set of
builtin implicit rules is somewhat different from those for
GNU make, though the variable names are largely compatible.
The builtin rules should successfully <br>
compile C/C++/Fortran programs, and in fact may be able to
guess the proper libraries in some cases too. Support for
Modula-2 and RatFor and other rare languages is <br>
deliberately not present, because I kept running into
problems with GNU make&rsquo;s rules when I accidentally
reused the extensions for those languages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; An action prefix
of &quot;+&quot; is silently ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Archive members
are not supported, and neither are the associated automatic
variables $%, &quot;$(%D)&quot;, and &quot;$(%F)&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; There is no SCCS
support.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Leading and
trailing whitespace in variable assignments is ignored (even
if the whitespace is followed by a comment). For more
details on whitespace handling <br>
incompatibilities, see &quot;Whitespace in variables&quot;
in makepp_variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Makepp does not
attempt to rebuild files included with the
&quot;include&quot; statement unless the makefile contains a
rule for building them before the include statement is seen.
<br>
(It will attempt to rebuild the makefile itself, however.)
This is normally used for handling include file
dependencies, and is not as useful with makepp since you
don&rsquo;t <br>
need to do that anyway.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The
&quot;SHELL&quot; variable is currently partially ignored.
Makepp always uses /bin/sh unless /usr/xpg4/bin/sh or
/sbin/xpg4/sh is found or unless you export the
&quot;SHELL&quot; variable <br>
in your makefile. But if you do, the command parser might
not fully understand what your shell command does. On
Windows Strawberry or ActiveState Perl you must instead set
<br>
your SHELL variable before calling makepp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Dependencies of
anything on the Makefile still work, but are usually
unnecessary. This is usually used to force a rebuild when
compilation options change. Makepp knows when <br>
build commands have changed without anything special in the
makefile; it stores this on a file-by-file basis. If you
change the makefile, it knows exactly which files need <br>
recompilation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Intermediate
files are not deleted. (Because makepp insists on having all
of the file dates be the same as they were on the last
build, intermediate files must all be <br>
present or else rebuilds will occur.) There is no special
status accorded to intermediate files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The only special
target that is supported is &quot;.PHONY&quot; and partially
&quot;.SUFFIXES&quot;. The remaining are simply ingored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specifically, GNU make has the
following special targets:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">.SUFFIXES <br>
Makepp ignores &quot;.SUFFIXES&quot; except for the special
case of &quot;.SUFFIXES&quot; with no dependencies, like
this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">.SUFFIXES:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">which tells it not to load any
of its default rules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">.INTERMEDIATE, .SECONDARY,
.PRECIOUS <br>
No special status is accorded to intermediate files and so
these targets are not meaningful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">.IGNORE <br>
This target is ignored. If you want to ignore errors, put
the word &quot;ignore_error&quot; (or a minus sign) in front
of the command whose exit status is to be ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">.SILENT <br>
This target is ignored. If you want commands not to echo,
put the word &quot;noecho&quot; (or the &quot;@&quot;
character) in front of the command which is not supposed to
be echoed, or use <br>
the &quot;--silent&quot; option to makepp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">.DELETE_ON_ERROR <br>
.EXPORT_ALL_VARIABLES <br>
.NOEXPORT <br>
.POSIX <br>
.DEFAULT <br>
These targets are not supported and are simply ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The GNU make
functions &quot;eval&quot;, &quot;flavor&quot; and
&quot;value&quot; are not currently supported. You can
achieve the same thing as eval in a more straight-forward
way with &quot;$[...]&quot; variable <br>
or function expansion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Double colon
rules are not fully supported. (They cannot be: in
makepp&rsquo;s paradigm, there cannot be more than one way
to update a target.) Currently, each successive double <br>
colon rule for a given target simply appends its command
string and dependency list to the command string and
dependency list for this target. For example, if you write
<br>
this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a :: b <br>
&amp;cat b -o a</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Later in your makefile: <br>
a :: c <br>
&amp;cat c -o &gt;&gt;a</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">it is exactly the same as if you
had written</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a : b c <br>
&amp;cat b -o a <br>
&amp;cat c -o &gt;&gt;a</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is certainly not what
double colon rules are intended for, and it will not always
work, but it does work for targets like &quot;clean&quot; or
for all the stuff that <br>
ExtUtils::MakeMaker puts into its makefiles. Don&rsquo;t
count on it for anything other than legacy makefiles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The
&quot;$(wildcard )&quot; function matches not only files
which exist, but also files which do not yet exist, but
which have a rule which makepp has seen at the time the <br>
&quot;$(wildcard )&quot; function is evaluated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The
&quot;define&quot; statement is supported, but handling of
&quot;@&quot; preceding it is done differently. Currently in
makepp, &quot;@&quot; in front of a variable which has a
multi-line value will <br>
only suppress echoing of the first line. For example,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">define echo-lines <br>
&amp;echo line1 -o $@ <br>
&amp;echo line2 -o&gt;&gt;$@ <br>
endef</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">x: <br>
@$(echo-lines)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will not suppress printing of
&quot;&amp;echo line2&quot; as it does in GNU make; it will
only suppress printing of &quot;&amp;echo line1&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Makepp does not
support the following environment variables (it does not set
them up, and it just ignores them):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MAKEOVERRIDES <br>
MFLAGS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Incompatibilities in order of
expression expansion <br>
&Acirc;&middot; In makepp, rule actions are expanded before
all of the dependencies are guaranteed to have been built.
You can work around this by changing rules such as this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">foo: bar <br>
genfoo &lt; $(shell cat bar)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">to this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">foo: bar <br>
genfoo &lt; &lsquo;cat bar&lsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or this, which will make the
file during the expansion:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">foo: bar <br>
genfoo &lt; $(&amp;cat $(make bar))</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is preferable here, because
the file listed in bar is also a dependency of this rule,
and makepp can now catch it when lexically analyzing the
redirection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Though I have
not seen this used, GNU make allows the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">colon = : <br>
a$(colon) b <br>
echo $^</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Makepp expands
&quot;$(colon)&quot; too late for this to work. However it
offers the alternative &quot;$[colon]&quot; syntax, which
can do much more than GNU make, because it is expanded very
<br>
early.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;$(MAKE)&quot; may include
spaces <br>
In an uninstalled makepp or if the platform doesn&rsquo;t
seem to support starting a Perl script by magic number or
with &quot;--traditional-recursive-make&quot; this variable
will include at <br>
least one space. That is not a problem when using it as a
command. But when passing it as an unquoted parameter to a
script (as the Perl 5.14.0 build system does), it will tear
<br>
it apart into separate parameters, leading to confusion. So
as a parameter it is safer to quote it as
&rsquo;$(MAKE)&rsquo;. which doesn&rsquo;t break backward
compatibility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Target-specific assignments
don&rsquo;t propagate <br>
Makepp&rsquo;s target-specific variables are slightly
different from GNU make&rsquo;s in that they only apply to
the rule for the one file mentioned, and not to any of its
predecessors; see <br>
Target-specific assignments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Parentheses or braces
don&rsquo;t nest <br>
Makepp ends expressions at the first matching parenthesis or
brace. Instead of this</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$(somefunction ... ( ) ...) #
GNU make style</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">you must use either of these</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">${somefunction ... ( ) ...} #
GNU make compatible <br>
$((somefunction ... ( ) ...)) # Makepp extension</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This will probably be fixed in
version 2.1, maybe optionally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Minor points <br>
Pattern dependencies don&rsquo;t match phony targets <br>
%.a: %.b; ... <br>
$(phony x.b): ; ... # does not provide a way to build
x.a</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Comments don&rsquo;t have
continuation lines <br>
# This is NOT a 2-line comment</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Command line incompatibilities
<br>
Makepp supports a few of make&rsquo;s more useful command
line options. The following, however, are not supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d or --debug <br>
-f - <br>
Makepp&rsquo;s internal makefile objects are linked to file
objects, so it can&rsquo;t handle stdin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i <br>
-l or --load-average or --max-load <br>
-m Makepp&rsquo;s &quot;-m&quot; option has to do with
signature method selection, whereas GNU make ignores -m.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p or --print-data-base <br>
-q or --question <br>
-R or --no-builtin-variables <br>
Makepp&rsquo;s &quot;-R&quot; option actually does something
completely different.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S --no-keep-going or --stop
<br>
The &quot;--stop&quot; option stops (puts to sleep) makepp
after learning all the rules, so you can continue
editing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t or --touch <br>
-w or --print-directory <br>
This happens automatically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--warn-undefined-variables</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some of these can be easily
supported if anyone cares.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Variable incompatibilities <br>
Makepp looks in $PATH for a matching command to return for
variables like &quot;$(CC)&quot; or &quot;$(CXX)&quot;,
while GNU make has static defaults. Also makepp gives
preference to &quot;gcc&quot; and <br>
&quot;g++&quot; while surprisingly GNU make returns
&quot;cc&quot; for the former, but the same for the latter.
You can override these in the makefile, on the command line
or by exporting a <br>
variable of the same name before invoking makepp.</p>
