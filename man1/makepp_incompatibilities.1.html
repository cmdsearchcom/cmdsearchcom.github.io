makepp_incompatibilities -- Incompatibilities between makepp and GNU make
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
Makepp was designed to be as close as possible to GNU make
  (&lt;http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html&gt;). GNU autotools
  (&lt;http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/automake.html&gt;), CMake
  (&lt;http://www.cmake.org/&gt;), Premake
  (&lt;http://industriousone.com/premake&gt; and see remark below) or
  handcrafted legacy build systems should be buildable with makepp. This is so
  you can either migrate projects effortlessly. Or if you don't want to enjoy
  all of makepp's advantages (e.g. so others can still build your project with
  GNU make) while you profit from the reliability advantage for your
  development.
<div class="Pp"></div>
However, because of the difference in philosophy, some of GNU make's or POSIX
  make's
  (&lt;http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/utilities/make.html&gt;)
  features cannot be supported. A few have not been implemented because we
  haven't had time. Most of the differences from GNU make are quite technical
  and only rarely cause problems. Alas the workarounds for the short-comings of
  traditional make are becoming more and more complex, and are giving makepp a
  hard time.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In a nutshell, if it doesn't build out of the box, try:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    makepp --no-warn makepp_simple_concatenation=1 makepp_percent_subdirs=1 \
        --build-check=target_newer --last-chance-rules --no-remake-makefiles
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If that succeeds, you can try to eliminate those arguments one by one. But if
  that fails, try adding:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        --traditional-recursive-make
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If that also fails, the build system needs some tweaking to cooperate with
  makepp. Even if some options described here make something buildable, it is
  still recommended to adapt things slightly, so they become compatible out of
  the box with both makes.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Forcing_more_POSIX_or_GNU_make_compatibility"><a class="selflink" href="#Forcing_more_POSIX_or_GNU_make_compatibility">Forcing
  more POSIX or GNU make compatibility</a></h1>
Here are some command line possibilities for getting many legacy build systems
  to work without modification. They cause makepp to emulate GNU make's behavior
  precisely.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Compatibility_via_the_option:_&quot;--build-check=target_newer&quot;"><a class="selflink" href="#Compatibility_via_the_option:_&quot;--build-check=target_newer&quot;">Compatibility
  via the option: &quot;--build-check=target_newer&quot;</a></h2>
By default, makepp will attempt to rebuild all targets if any of the
  dependencies have changed since the last build, or if the command has changed
  (see makepp_build_check for details). This is normally what you want.
  Sometimes, however, you don't want the target to be rebuilt if it has been
  modified apart from the control of makepp (e.g., by editing it, or by running
  a program manually to make the file). You can force makepp to use the
  traditional make algorithm, which only rebuilds if any of the targets are
  newer than the dependencies, by adding this option to the command line.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Compatibility_via_the_option:_&quot;--dont-build=config.status&quot;"><a class="selflink" href="#Compatibility_via_the_option:_&quot;--dont-build=config.status&quot;">Compatibility
  via the option: &quot;--dont-build=config.status&quot;</a></h2>
There are packages which try to autoconfigure themselves, or do other things,
  which gmake ignores unless being asked to, like:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    config.status : configure
        ./config.status --recheck
 
    configure : configure.in aclocal.m4
        autoconf
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Most people don't even have &quot;autoconf&quot; installed, so conscientiously
  doing everything by the rules, as makepp does, will fail. This option prevents
  that, if you figure out what not to build.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Compatibility_via_the_option:_&quot;--last-chance-rules&quot;"><a class="selflink" href="#Compatibility_via_the_option:_&quot;--last-chance-rules&quot;">Compatibility
  via the option: &quot;--last-chance-rules&quot;</a></h2>
Default rules (pattern rules with no pattern dependencies) are not normally
  supported. Makepp instantiates all rules based on the existing files, so that
  it is aware of every file that could be generated. Alas this way it does not
  know how to instantiate a pattern rule with no pattern dependency. The
  :last_chance mechanism partially remedies that. Where this is good enough for
  legacy makefiles, this option allows turning it on globally.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Compatibility_via_the_option:_&quot;--no-warn&quot;"><a class="selflink" href="#Compatibility_via_the_option:_&quot;--no-warn&quot;">Compatibility
  via the option: &quot;--no-warn&quot;</a></h2>
This one doesn't improve the result. Makepp will give warning messages for many
  things which the traditional Unix make accepts without flinching. This is
  because there are better ways to do them with makepp. If these warnings annoy
  you, you can turn them off with this option.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Compatibility_via_the_option:_&quot;--hybrid-recursive-make&quot;"><a class="selflink" href="#Compatibility_via_the_option:_&quot;--hybrid-recursive-make&quot;">Compatibility
  via the option: &quot;--hybrid-recursive-make&quot;</a></h2>
Recursive invocations of make are often considered to be an unsafe practice (see
  &quot;Better system for hierarchical builds&quot; in makepp for details), but
  they are extremely common in existing makefiles. Makepp supports recursive
  make for backward compatibility; for new makefiles, it is much better to use
  the &quot;load_makefile&quot; statement, or makepp's implicit makefile loading
  mechanism.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In order to be able to use repositories for variant builds, and to help make
  recursive invocations of make safer, makepp normally does not actually invoke
  itself recursively even if you tell it to. Instead, a subprocess communicates
  with the parent process, and the actual build is done by the parent process.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This works in most cases, but you may not invoke several makefiles from the same
  directory, e.g., the following will not work:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    target: dependencies
        $(MAKE) -f other_makefile targets
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
In this case makepp notices it is loading a 2nd makefile and complains. With
  this option instead it will fall back to the traditional way of building from
  additional makefiles in a separate makepp process each.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note: Technically loading several makefiles would be no problem, but they
  usually have the same phony target names. Keeping that apart would mean a
  complete redesign of makepp internals. However, this will work, but it is not
  equivalent:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    target: dependencies
        cd subdir &amp;&amp; $(MAKE) -f other_makefile targets
</pre>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Compatibility_via_the_option:_&quot;--traditional-recursive-make&quot;"><a class="selflink" href="#Compatibility_via_the_option:_&quot;--traditional-recursive-make&quot;">Compatibility
  via the option: &quot;--traditional-recursive-make&quot;</a></h2>
Sometimes the previous option is not enough, especially if the recursive
  invocations use contradictory options. Makepp uses only one set of global
  options, so a submake is not allowed to modify them, as that would also
  pertain to other makefiles.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Adding this option to the command line, has the following undesirable side
  effects:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Recursive makes do not internally execute in parallel, even
      if the parent does. Unlike gmake there is no overall coordination of the
      number of processes. This will not be implemented because this way of
      working is not a design goal of makepp.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Recursive make processes do not know anything about
      repositories.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Each recursive make process produces its own log file, in
      the directory it is invoked in, instead of producing one log file for the
      entire build.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Since makepp usually builds more than traditional make
      deems necessary, and since many build systems provide recursive calls in
      all directions, this may lead to endless recursion. Makepp will pull the
      brake after 50 rounds and tell you how to increase that, in case you
      really have such deep nesting.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Even with the &quot;--traditional-recursive-make&quot; option, the environment
  variables &quot;MAKEOVERRIDES&quot; and &quot;MFLAGS&quot; are not set up, and
  ignored, so makefiles that depend on those will not work.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A <b>Premake</b> generated <i>Makefile</i> is only a funny wrapper to a sub-make
  invocation in the same directory. If you have some project target <i>XYZ</i>
  it will have a line like
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        @${MAKE} --no-print-directory -C . -f XYZ.make
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
In this case you can avoid the &quot;--traditional-recursive-make&quot; option
  by directly invoking makepp with that &quot;-f <i>XYZ</i>.make&quot; option.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Compatibility_without_the_option:_&quot;--jobs=n&quot;"><a class="selflink" href="#Compatibility_without_the_option:_&quot;--jobs=n&quot;">Compatibility
  without the option: &quot;--jobs= <i>n</i>&quot;</a></h2>
Legacy makefiles will sometimes not list all dependencies, relying on the order
  of execution to make them in time. In this situation makepp may manage to call
  a rule before its dependencies have all been made. Then results may be better
  with less, or even no parallel execution.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Compatibility_via_the_variable:_&quot;makepp_simple_concatenation=1&quot;"><a class="selflink" href="#Compatibility_via_the_variable:_&quot;makepp_simple_concatenation=1&quot;">Compatibility
  via the variable: &quot;makepp_simple_concatenation=1&quot;</a></h2>
Rc-style substitution is the default way makepp performs variable substitution
  into text strings because it very rarely breaks legacy makefiles and is often
  useful in new makefiles. However, it does introduce occasional
  incompatibilities in the substitution of variables not surrounded by spaces.
  For example,
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    INCLUDE_PREFIX := -I/some/include/dir -I
    INCLUDES := $(INCLUDE_PREFIX)/other/include/dir
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
will set &quot;INCLUDES&quot; to
  &quot;-I/some/include/dir/other/include/dir&#x00A0;-I/other/include/dir&quot;
  if rc-style substitution is enabled, whereas GNU make would set it to
  &quot;-I/some/include/dir&#x00A0;-I/other/include/dir&quot;. E.g., when
  compiling Redis 2.6.5 it tries to run &quot;printfgcc&quot;. Such a funny
  concatenation of two commands is a strong indication that this variable is
  needed to fall back to make semantics.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There is also an incompatibility in the handling of whitespace in a variable:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    null :=
    T := -o $(null)             # T contains -o followed by one space.
    OUTFILE = $(T)outfile
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
will set &quot;OUTFILE&quot; to &quot;-ooutfile&quot; if rc-style substitution
  is enabled, whereas GNU make would set it to &quot;-o&#x00A0;outfile&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Both of these incompatibilities are removed by setting the
  &quot;makepp_simple_concatenation&quot; variable. Note, however, that even
  with &quot;makepp_simple_concatenation&quot;, makepp still treats whitespace
  incompatibly in some situations:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    T := -o # Don't delete this comment.
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
GNU make sets &quot;T&quot; to contain &quot;-o&quot; followed by a space,
  whereas makepp strips out the trailing space anyway. If you want the trailing
  space, you must set &quot;makepp_simple_concatenation&quot; and also set
  &quot;T&quot; using the technique involving a dummy variable such as
  &quot;null&quot;, as shown above.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Workaround_option_&quot;--no-remake-makefiles&quot;"><a class="selflink" href="#Workaround_option_&quot;--no-remake-makefiles&quot;">Workaround
  option &quot;--no-remake-makefiles&quot;</a></h2>
Typical open source requires calling &quot;configure&quot; to create the
  makefiles. But then these makefiles can contain rules to remake the makefile,
  by calling some command. Makepp will happily comply and update it according to
  the rule. But sometimes this is harmful, so just skip it.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Compatibility_via_the_variable:_&quot;makepp_percent_subdirs=1&quot;"><a class="selflink" href="#Compatibility_via_the_variable:_&quot;makepp_percent_subdirs=1&quot;">Compatibility
  via the variable: &quot;makepp_percent_subdirs=1&quot;</a></h2>
By default, &quot;%&quot; in a pattern rule does not match directories. This
  means that a rule like this:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    %.o: %.c
        $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c $(input) -o $(output)
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
will not be applied to files like &quot;../shared/xyz.c&quot;. If you want it to
  match files in subdirectories too, then set the variable
  &quot;makepp_percent_subdirs=1&quot; on the command line or near the beginning
  of a makefile.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Compatibility_via_the_environment_variable:_$MAKEPP_IGNORE_OPTS"><a class="selflink" href="#Compatibility_via_the_environment_variable:_$MAKEPP_IGNORE_OPTS">Compatibility
  via the environment variable: $MAKEPP_IGNORE_OPTS</a></h2>
Sometimes legacy recursive invocations pass options that makepp doesn't
  understand. Hopefully the option is not important, but it prevents makepp from
  running. With this environment variable you can ask makepp to silently ignore
  certain options. The value shall be a space separated list of options, which
  can come in 4 variants:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">--<i>long</i>=x</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">A long option that expects an argument. This fact must be
      declared through the equals sign, though the actual use may also separated
      by whitespace, either &quot;--long=bla&quot; or &quot;--long
    bla&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">--<i>long</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">A long option without an argument.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">-<i>s</i>x</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">A short option that expects an argument. This fact must be
      declared by adding something directly after the option, though the actual
      use may also separated by whitespace, either &quot;-sbla&quot; or &quot;-s
      bla&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">-<i>s</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">A short option without an argument.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
E.g. override makepp's -R option by one without an argument and accept gmake's
  debug option with an argument:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    export MAKEPP_IGNORE_OPTS='-R --debug=x'

      the path to the file found in the vpath, makepp will instead link it
      symbolically to where it is needed. Thus makepp will provide an unmodified
      string, which is usually not a problem.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Targets in a vpath are not supported. (Gmake considers them if they are

    This is certainly not what double colon rules are intended for, and it will
      not always work, but it does work for targets like &quot;clean&quot; or
      for all the stuff that ExtUtils::MakeMaker puts into its makefiles. Don't
      count on it for anything other than legacy makefiles.</dd>

  <dd class="It-tag">In makepp, rule actions are expanded before all of the
      dependencies are guaranteed to have been built. You can work around this
      by changing rules such as this:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    foo: bar
        genfoo &lt; $(shell cat bar)
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    to this:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    foo: bar
        genfoo &lt; `cat bar`
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    or this, which will make the file during the expansion:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    foo: bar
        genfoo &lt; $(&amp;cat $(make bar))
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This is preferable here, because the file listed in <i>bar</i> is also a
      dependency of this rule, and makepp can now catch it when lexically
      analyzing the redirection.</dd>

  <dd class="It-tag">Though I have not seen this used, GNU make allows the
      following:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    colon = :
    a$(colon) b
        echo $^
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Makepp expands &quot;$(colon)&quot; too late for this to work. However it
      offers the alternative &quot;$[colon]&quot; syntax, which can do much more
      than GNU make, because it is expanded very early.</dd>

  may include spaces</a></h2>
In an uninstalled makepp or if the platform doesn't seem to support starting a
  Perl script by magic number or with &quot;--traditional-recursive-make&quot;
  this variable will include at least one space. That is not a problem when
  using it as a command. But when passing it as an unquoted parameter to a
  script (as the Perl 5.14.0 build system does), it will tear it apart into
  separate parameters, leading to confusion. So as a parameter it is safer to
  quote it as '$(MAKE)'. which doesn't break backward compatibility.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Target-specific_assignments_don't_propagate"><a class="selflink" href="#Target-specific_assignments_don't_propagate">Target-specific

Makepp's target-specific variables are slightly different from GNU make's in
  that they only apply to the rule for the one file mentioned, and not to any of
  its predecessors; see Target-specific assignments.

Makepp ends expressions at the first matching parenthesis or brace. Instead of
  this
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    $(somefunction ... ( ) ...) # GNU make style
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
you must use either of these
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    ${somefunction ... ( ) ...} # GNU make compatible
    $((somefunction ... ( ) ...)) # Makepp extension
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This will probably be fixed in version 2.1, maybe optionally.

Makepp looks in $PATH for a matching command to return for variables like
  &quot;$(CC)&quot; or &quot;$(CXX)&quot;, while GNU make has static defaults.
  Also makepp gives preference to &quot;gcc&quot; and &quot;g++&quot; while
  surprisingly GNU make returns &quot;cc&quot; for the former, but the same for
  the latter. You can override these in the makefile, on the command line or by
  exporting a variable of the same name before invoking makepp.</div>
