<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ipa-restore - Restore an IPA master</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ipa-restore [OPTION]... BACKUP</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Only the name of the backup needs to be passed in, not the
full path. Backups are stored in a subdirectory in
/var/lib/ipa/backup. If a backup is in another location then
the <br>
full path must be provided.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The naming convention for full
backups is ipa-full-YEAR-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS in the GMT time
zone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The naming convention for data
backups is ipa-data-YEAR-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS In the GMT time
zone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The type of backup is
automatically detected. A data restore can be done from
either type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WARNING: A full restore will
restore files like /etc/passwd, /etc/group, /etc/resolv.conf
as well. Any file that IPA may have touched is backed up and
restored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An encrypted backup is also
automatically detected and the root keyring is used by
default. The --keyring option can be used to define the full
path to the private and public <br>
keys.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Within the subdirectory is file,
header, that describes the back up including the type,
system, date of backup, the version of IPA, the version of
the backup and the services on <br>
the master.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A backup can not be restored on
another host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A backup can not be restored in
a different version of IPA.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Restoring from backup sets the
server as the new data master. All other masters will need
to be re-initialized. The first step in restoring a backup
is to disable replication on <br>
all the other masters. This is to prevent the changelog from
overwriting the data in the backup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use the ipa-replica-manage and
ipa-csreplica-manage commands to re-initialize other
masters. ipa-csreplica-manage only needs to be executed on
masters that have a CA installed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REPLICATION <br>
The restoration on other masters needs to be done carefully,
to match the replication topology, working outward from the
restored master. For example, if your topology is A
&lt;-&gt; B <br>
&lt;-&gt; C and you restored master A you would restore B
first, then C.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Replication is disabled on all
masters that are available when a restoration is done. If a
master is down at the time of the restoration you will need
to proceed with extreme <br>
caution. If this master is brought back up after the
restoration is complete it may send out replication updates
that apply the very changes you were trying to back out. The
only <br>
safe answer is to reinstall the master. This would involve
deleting all replication agreements to the master. This
could have a cascading effect if the master is a hub to
other <br>
masters. They would need to be connected to other masters
before removing the downed master.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the restore point is from a
period prior to a replication agreement then the master will
need to be re-installed. For example, you have masters A and
B and you create a <br>
backup. You then add master C from B. Then you restore from
the backup. The restored data is going to lose the
replication agreement to C. The master on C will have a
replication <br>
agreement pointing to B, but B won&rsquo;t have the reverse
agreement. Master C won&rsquo;t be registered as an IPA
master. It may be possible to manually correct these and
re-connect C to B <br>
but it would be very prone to error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If re-initializing on an IPA
master version prior to 3.2 then the replication agreements
will need to be manually re-enabled otherwise the
re-initialization will never complete. <br>
To manually enable an agreement use ldapsearch to find the
agreement name in cn=mapping tree,cn=config. The value of
nsds5ReplicaEnabled needs to be on, and enabled on both <br>
sides. Remember that CA replication is done through a
separate agreement and will need to be updated
separately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you have older masters you
should consider re-creating them rather than trying to
re-initialize them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-p, --password=PASSWORD <br>
The Directory Manager password.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--data Restore the data only.
The default is to restore everything in the backup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--gpg-keyring=GPG_KEYRING <br>
The full path to a GPG keyring. The keyring consists of two
files, a public and a private key (.sec and .pub
respectively). Specify the path without an extension.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-logs <br>
Exclude the IPA service log files in the backup (if they
were backed up).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--online <br>
Perform the restore on-line. Requires data-only backup or
the --data option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--instance=INSTANCE <br>
Restore only the databases in this 389-ds instance. The
default is to restore all found (at most this is the IPA
REALM instance and the PKI-IPA instance). Requires <br>
data-only backup or the --data option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--backend=BACKEND <br>
The backend to restore within an instance or instances.
Requires data-only backup or the --data option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--v, --verbose <br>
Print debugging information</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --debug <br>
Alias for --verbose</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q, --quiet <br>
Output only errors</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--log-file=FILE <br>
Log to the given file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
0 if the command was successful</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 if an error occurred</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/var/lib/ipa/backup <br>
The default directory for storing backup files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/var/log/iparestore.log <br>
