<p>DOSCAN(1) DOSCAN(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
doscan - Denial Of Service Capable Auditing of Networks</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
doscan options prefix...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
doscan is a tool to discover TCP services ony our network.
It is designed for scanning a single ports on a large
network. (There are better tools for scanning many ports on
a <br>
small set of hosts, for example nmap(8).)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The prefix parameter instructs
doscan to scan all addresses in this prefix. Prefix notation
is, as usual, A.B.C.D/L, where A.B.C.D is an IP address in
dotted-quad notation, and <br>
L is a prefix length from 1 to 32. If the /L part is
omitted, /32 is assumed (and a single host is scanned).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">doscan uses a random scatter
technology to distribute the load across the network. Within
a given prefix, hosts are not scanned sequentially, but in a
random-looking, but repro&acirc; <br>
ducible order. As a result, doscan will not stress-test the
network edge (just the next hop). (The prefixes themselves
are scanned in order.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The --port option is mandatory, all other options are
optional.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a timeout, --add-timeout
timeout <br>
-A count, --add-burst count <br>
These options specify the timeout (in milliseconds) before
new connections are added, and the number of new connections
or hosts to add in one burst. Each timeout mil&acirc; <br>
lisecond, count new hosts are contacted. (The per-host
timeout controlled by the --timeout option is independent.
It specifies the timeout once the first packet has been <br>
sent.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b count, --banner count <br>
doscan reads at most count bytes from the remote host. The
exact effect of this option varies among protocol modules,
see the PROTOCOL MODULES section for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c count, --connections count
<br>
At most count connections are established in parallel. See
CAVEATS below for problems resulting from system file
descriptor limits, and instructions for choosing this <br>
parameter. By default, at most 50 parallel connections are
established.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E, --no-epoll <br>
Do not use the epoll kernel interface even if it&rsquo;s
available (useful for debugging).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, --file name <br>
doscan reads prefixes from the file name, in addition to the
command line. The file shall contain one prefix per line.
See the DESCRIPTION section above for the prefix <br>
format. To better distribute scanning of long prefix lists,
all prefixies are reorded randomly if the --file option is
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i, --indicator <br>
Display a progress indicator. If doscan is invoked with this
option, the number of connections which have been
established so far, the total number of addresses to be <br>
scanned, the number of currently active connections, and the
number of hosts for which a report entry has been generated
are displayed periodically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --net-errors <br>
Instructs doscan to report network errors even if they
prevent a connection. Normally, such errors are
suppressed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o format, --output format <br>
This option changes the format which doscan uses to report
its findings. See the OUTPUT FORMAT section below for
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p port, --port port <br>
The --port option controls to which TCP port doscan connects
when scanning a host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--protocol Istring, -P Istring
<br>
Chooses the protocol module string. See the PROTOCOL MODULES
section for information on available protocol modules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--send string, -s string <br>
--receive regexp, -r regexp <br>
The effects of these options depend on the protocol module.
See the PROTOCOL MODULES section for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--style style, -S style <br>
This option controls the output style. See the OUTPUT FORMAT
section for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t timeout, --timeout timeout
<br>
This option sets the connect timeout to timeout
milliseconds. If this time passes without a successfully
established connection, doscan skips the hosts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
Turn on additional reporting to standard error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Display help message and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
Output version information and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROTOCOL MODULES <br>
doscan supports several protocol modules. By default, the
generic tcp module is used, but you can choose another
module using the --protocol option. The effect of the
--banner, <br>
--send and --receive options depends on the protocol module.
Available modules include:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">http This module causes doscan
to connect to HTTP servers, send a request, and collect the
server identification from the response.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The --banner option specifies
the maximum receive buffer size. It defaults to 4000
bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The --send option specifies the
request that is send to the server. The string can include C
escape sequences to send control characters. By default, the
request GET /0r(that is, GET / HTTP/1.0 followed by the <br>
HTTP/1.0 four characters CR, LF, CR, LF) is sent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The --receive option is not
supported by this protocol module.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">http_proxy <br>
This protocol module probes hosts for open HTTP proxies. The
--port option controls the port that is probed. The required
--receive option must be an integer in the <br>
range from 1 to 65534, the number specifies the port on
which doscan listens for the connections from open proxies.
The required --send option specifies the HTTP request <br>
method, either &quot;GET&quot; or &quot;CONNECT&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The --banner option is not
supported by this protocol module.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning: In the worst case, the
amount of file descriptors is slightly more than twice the
number of parallel connections given by the --connections
options. The addi&acirc; <br>
tional file descriptors are used by doscan&rsquo;s HTTP
server component to process the connections from open
proxies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See the EXAMPLES section for
some convenient combinations of those otions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ident_check <br>
This protocol module reports hosts which have TCP service
listening on the specified port which is not a proper
IDENT/AUTH daemon. It is most useful with a --port 113 <br>
command line argument. None of the --banner, --receive and
--send options are supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tcp This module is intended for
generic TCP service probing and fingerprinting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The --banner option controls the
maximum length of banner strings which are collected. If its
argument is zero or if the option is not specified, no
banner strings are <br>
collected. In this case, doscan closes connections
immediately after they have been established (which results
in an increased scanning rate).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After establishing a connection,
doscans sends the string specified by the --send option to
the remote host. The string can contain the usual C escape
sequences (includ&acirc; <br>
ing 00), to send non-printable characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The --receive option specifies a
Perl-compatible regular expression (PCRE), and doscan uses
it to analyze the data returned by a remote host. The
regular expression may <br>
contain at least one capturing subpattern, it is always
anchored at the beginning of the received data. The
character . (period) matches all characters (including
new&acirc; <br>
line). $ (dollar sign) matches the very end of the received
data (which may, however, still be incomplete). See
pcrepattern(3) for details about the syntax of
Perl-com&acirc; <br>
patible regular expression.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The --receive regular expression
is used by doscan for several purposes. If data is received
from a remote host, and if the regular expression ends with
$, doscan immedi&acirc; <br>
ately closes the connection if all the data received so far
from this host matches the regular expression. (doscan
assumes that the reply is complete; increased scanning <br>
speed is the result.) When a connection is terminated for
any reason, doscan checks if the regular expression matches
the collected data. If it doesn&rsquo;t, a no match error
<br>
is recorded (if no other error occured). If it does, and the
regular expression contains a capturing subpattern, that
subpattern is recorded. Otherwise, the whole data <br>
is recorded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to use the --receive
option, you have to specify the --banner option as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">udp This module is a generic UDP
scanner, as far such a thing is possible. It sends up to
five UDP packets (whose payload is controlled by the
mandatory --send option) to the <br>
specified port. Replies are collected. The --banner option
is implicit and set to the maximum payload size.
Retransmission is stopped when the first reply is
received.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In verbose mode (with both
--verbose and --net-errors options), a warning like
&quot;stray UDP packet from 192.0.2.4:7&quot; is printed to
standard error when an unexpected UDP <br>
packets is received. Packets to sent to network or broadcast
adresses trigger such packets, and poorly implemented UDP
services on multi-homed machines answer with a dif&acirc;
<br>
ferent source IP address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT FORMAT <br>
doscan prints all gathered data about scanned prefixes to
standard output, just before the program terminates. The
output format can be changed with the --output option. The
<br>
format argument of this option is a string which includes %
substitions, similar to printf(3). The following substitions
are supported</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%% A literal percent
character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%a The address of the remote
host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%b The banner return by the
host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%e The error code as a string,
empty if no error occurred while scanning the host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is either a system error
constant (such as ECONNREFUSED), or the string unknown
(unknown error code). If the --receive option is active and
the received data does <br>
not match the specified regular expresion, and no other
error has occured, the column contains no match.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%E The numeric error code
corresponding to the %e error message, or zero if no error
occurred. Negativ error numbers are returned for internal
errors (such as a failed match <br>
against the --receive regular expression).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%n The host name corresponding
to the scanned IP address (based on a DNS lookup). Note that
this slows down reporting a lot, in general. For this
reason, it is not recom&acirc; <br>
mended to use %n together with --style unsorted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%N A verbatim ASCII LF (newline)
character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%r The time when the information
was gathered, measured in seconds since the scanning
started.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%t The time when the information
was gathered, in local time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%T Same as %t, but in UTC (also
known as GMT).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%% A verbatim percent sign
(%).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default value for the
--output option is %T%a%e%b, where denotes an ASCII HTAB
character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The --style or -S option
supports the following arguments:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sort-by-host <br>
The output is sorted by the IP address of the scanned host.
(This is the default.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unsorted <br>
The output is not sorted and appears in the order the hosts
responded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Caution: Do not use this style
together with an --output argument which includes %n, and do
not pipe the output of doscan to a process which cannot read
its standard input <br>
quickly. Output is performed synchronously, and if it is
delayed, this might impact the scanning activity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In all cases except unsorted,
output is delayed just before the termination of the
program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
doscan --banner 100 --port 13 192.0.2.1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Prints the time on the host
192.0.2.1 (if it runs a daytime server).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">doscan --banner 100 --receive
&rsquo;(.*)0&rsquo; --port 22 192.0.2.0/24</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Scan for SSH servers and record
the banners (usually containing version information about
the SSH server). ?0&rsquo; --port 25</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">doscan --banner 200 --receive
&rsquo;(.*?) 192.0.2.0/24</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Scan for SMTP servers and record
their greeting messages. Works for FTP as well, with --port
21 instead of --port 25. 0r0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">doscan --banner 2000 --send
&rsquo;GET / HTTP/1.0 ?0*$&rsquo; --port 80 0*) * --receive
&rsquo;.*?0erver: *([^ 192.0.2.0/24</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Scan for HTTP servers and record
their version strings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">doscan --protocol http_proxy
--port 3128 --send GET --receive 80 192.0.2.0/24</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Scan for open proxies on TCP
port 3128, using the GET HTTP request method. Try to connect
back to port 80 on the scanning host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is recommended that you use
port 80 for the listening port if you scan using GET
requests. For CONNECT requests, port 443 should be used (see
below). Some administrators <br>
might restrict CONNECT to TCP port 443 (or filter it for the
GET request method), so these choices give best results.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">doscan --protocol http_proxy
--port 8080 --send CONNECT --receive 443 192.0.2.0/24</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Scan for open proxies on TCP
port 8080, using the CONNECT HTTP request method. Try to
connect back to port 443 on the scanning host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CAVEATS <br>
The most important option for tuning is --connections.
Increasing this option can greatly increase scanning
performance. However, there a two caveats: Many connections
require <br>
many sockets, and your system might not support so many of
them. Furthermore, a large number of parallel connections
generates significant numbers of packets, and a high CPU
<br>
load, which can both lead to spurious connection failures
(false negatives).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To increase the number of
connections your system can process, you usually have to
raise the corresponding ulimit value in your shell, which
requires root privileges. For exam&acirc; <br>
ple, in bash(1), you can invoke</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ulimit -n 10030</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">to raise the descriptor limit to
10030. You can then pass --connections 10000 to doscan.
(Some file descriptors are not used for scanning, but have
to be open nonetheless, and <br>
count towards the ulimit -n limit.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On Linux-based systems, you
might have to adjust some sysctl values which control
system-wide descriptor limits. Refer to sysctl.conf(5), the
Documentation directory in the <br>
Linux source tree, or the source code itself for
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note, however, that if you
increase the number of parallel connections beyond a certain
value, you will lose some hosts, that is they will not be
reported even though they are <br>
running a service on the scanned port. Therefore, you should
watch both network and CPU utilization to detect
bottlenecks. Although the random scatter technique employed
by <br>
doscan tries to split the load across your whole network,
this obviously fails if the next hop cannot bear the
traffic.</p>
