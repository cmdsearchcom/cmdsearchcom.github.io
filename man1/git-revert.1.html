<p>GIT-REVERT(1) Git Manual GIT-REVERT(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
git-revert - Revert some existing commits</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
git revert [--[no-]edit] [-n] [-m parent-number] [-s]
&lt;commit&gt;... <br>
git revert --continue <br>
git revert --quit <br>
git revert --abort</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Given one or more existing commits, revert the changes that
the related patches introduce, and record some new commits
that record them. This requires your working tree to be <br>
clean (no modifications from the HEAD commit).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: git revert is used to
record some new commits to reverse the effect of some
earlier commits (often only a faulty one). If you want to
throw away all uncommitted changes in <br>
your working directory, you should see git-reset(1),
particularly the --hard option. If you want to extract
specific files as they were in another commit, you should
see git- <br>
checkout(1), specifically the git checkout &lt;commit&gt; --
&lt;filename&gt; syntax. Take care with these alternatives
as both will discard uncommitted changes in your working
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
&lt;commit&gt;... <br>
Commits to revert. For a more complete list of ways to spell
commit names, see gitrevisions(7). Sets of commits can also
be given but no traversal is done by default, see <br>
git-rev-list(1) and its --no-walk option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e, --edit <br>
With this option, git revert will let you edit the commit
message prior to committing the revert. This is the default
if you run the command from a terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m parent-number, --mainline
parent-number <br>
Usually you cannot revert a merge because you do not know
which side of the merge should be considered the mainline.
This option specifies the parent number (starting from 1)
<br>
of the mainline and allows revert to reverse the change
relative to the specified parent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Reverting a merge commit
declares that you will never want the tree changes brought
in by the merge. As a result, later merges will only bring
in tree changes introduced by <br>
commits that are not ancestors of the previously reverted
merge. This may or may not be what you want.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See the revert-a-faulty-merge
How-To[1] for more details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-edit <br>
With this option, git revert will not start the commit
message editor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --no-commit <br>
Usually the command automatically creates some commits with
commit log messages stating which commits were reverted.
This flag applies the changes necessary to revert the <br>
named commits to your working tree and the index, but does
not make the commits. In addition, when this option is used,
your index does not have to match the HEAD commit. The <br>
revert is done against the beginning state of your
index.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is useful when reverting
more than one commits&rsquo; effect to your index in a
row.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --signoff <br>
Add Signed-off-by line at the end of the commit message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--strategy=&lt;strategy&gt; <br>
Use the given merge strategy. Should only be used once. See
the MERGE STRATEGIES section in git-merge(1) for
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X&lt;option&gt;,
--strategy-option=&lt;option&gt; <br>
Pass the merge strategy-specific option through to the merge
strategy. See git-merge(1) for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEQUENCER SUBCOMMANDS <br>
--continue <br>
Continue the operation in progress using the information in
.git/sequencer. Can be used to continue after resolving
conflicts in a failed cherry-pick or revert.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--quit <br>
Forget about the current operation in progress. Can be used
to clear the sequencer state after a failed cherry-pick or
revert.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--abort <br>
Cancel the operation and return to the pre-sequence
state.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
git revert HEAD~3 <br>
Revert the changes specified by the fourth last commit in
HEAD and create a new commit with the reverted changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">git revert -n master~5..master~2
<br>
Revert the changes done by commits from the fifth last
commit in master (included) to the third last commit in
master (included), but do not create any commit with the
<br>
reverted changes. The revert only modifies the working tree
and the index.</p>
