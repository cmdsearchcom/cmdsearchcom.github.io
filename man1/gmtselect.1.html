<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: No space is allowed
between the option flag and the associated arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
gmtselect is a filter that reads (x, y) or (longitude,
latitude) positions from the first 2 columns of infiles [or
standard input] and uses a combination of 1-7 criteria to
pass <br>
or reject the records. Records can be selected based on
whether or not they are 1) inside a rectangular region (-R
[and -J]), 2) within dist km of any point in pointfile, 3)
<br>
within dist km of any line in linefile, 4) inside one of the
polygons in the polygonfile, 5) inside geographical features
(based on coastlines), 6) has z-values within a given <br>
range, or 7) inside bins of a grid mask whose nodes are
non-zero. The sense of the tests can be reversed for each of
these 6 criteria by using the -I option. See option -: on
how <br>
to read (y,x) or (latitude,longitude) files. Note: If no
projection information is used then you must supply -fg to
tell gmtselect that your data are geographical.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REQUIRED ARGUMENTS <br>
None</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS <br>
table One or more ASCII (or binary, see -bi[ncols][type])
data table file(s) holding a number of data columns. If no
tables are given then we read from standard input.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Amin_area[/min_level/max_level][+ag|i|s|S][+r|l][+ppercent]
<br>
Features with an area smaller than min_area in km^2 or of
hierarchical level that is lower than min_level or higher
than max_level will not be plotted [Default is 0/0/4 <br>
(all features)]. Level 2 (lakes) contains regular lakes and
wide river bodies which we normally include as lakes; append
+r to just get river-lakes or +l to just get reg&acirc; <br>
ular lakes. By default (+ai) we select the ice shelf
boundary as the coastline for Antarctica; append +ag to
instead select the ice grounding line as coastline. For <br>
expert users who wish to print their own Antarctica
coastline and islands via psxy you can use +as to skip all
GSHHG features below 60S or +aS to instead skip all features
<br>
north of 60S. Finally, append +ppercent to exclude polygons
whose percentage area of the corresponding full-resolution
feature is less than percent. See GSHHG INFORMATION <br>
below for more details. Ignored unless -N is set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Cpointfile+ddist[unit] <br>
Pass all records whose location is within dist of any of the
points in the ASCII file pointfile. If dist is zero then the
3rd column of pointfile must have each point&acirc;s <br>
individual radius of influence. Distances are Cartesian and
in user units; specify -fg to indicate spherical distances
and append a distance unit (see UNITS). Alterna&acirc; <br>
tively, if -R and -J are used then geographic coordinates
are projected to map coordinates (in cm, inch, or points, as
determined by PROJ_LENGTH_UNIT) before Cartesian <br>
distances are compared to dist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Dresolution[+] <br>
Ignored unless -N is set. Selects the resolution of the
coastline data set to use ((f)ull, (h)igh, (i)ntermediate,
(l)ow, or (c)rude). The resolution drops off by ~80% <br>
between data sets. [Default is l]. Append (+) to
automatically select a lower resolution should the one
requested not be available [abort if not found]. Note that
because <br>
the coastlines differ in details it is not guaranteed that a
point will remain inside [or outside] when a different
resolution is selected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E[fn] Specify how points
exactly on a polygon boundary should be considered. By
default, such points are considered to be inside the
polygon. Append n and/or f to change this <br>
behavior for the -F and -N options, respectively, so that
boundary points are considered to be outside.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Fpolygonfile <br>
Pass all records whose location is within one of the closed
polygons in the multiple-segment file polygonfile. For
spherical polygons (lon, lat), make sure no consecutive <br>
points are separated by 180 degrees or more in longitude.
Note that polygonfile must be in ASCII regardless of whether
-bi is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Ggridmask</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pass all locations that are
inside the valid data area of the grid gridmask. <br>
Nodes that are outside are either NaN or zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I[cflrsz] <br>
Reverses the sense of the test for each of the criteria
specified:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c select records NOT inside any
point&acirc;s circle of influence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f select records NOT inside any
of the polygons.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">g will pass records inside the
cells with z equal zero of the grid mask in -G.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">l select records NOT within the
specified distance of any line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">r select records NOT inside the
specified rectangular region.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">s select records NOT considered
inside as specified by -N (and -A, -D).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">z select records NOT within the
range specified by -Z.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Jparameters (more
&acirc;&brvbar;) <br>
Select map projection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Llinefile+ddist[unit][+p] <br>
Pass all records whose location is within dist of any of the
line segments in the ASCII multiple-segment file linefile.
If dist is zero then we will scan each sub-header <br>
in the linefile for an embedded -Ddist setting that sets
each line&acirc;s individual distance value. Distances are
Cartesian and in user units; specify -fg to indicate
spheri&acirc; <br>
cal distances append a distance unit (see UNITS).
Alternatively, if -R and -J are used then geographic
coordinates are projected to map coordinates (in cm, inch,
m, or <br>
points, as determined by PROJ_LENGTH_UNIT) before Cartesian
distances are compared to dist. Append +p to ensure only
points whose orthogonal projections onto the nearest <br>
line-segment fall within the segments endpoints [Default
considers points &acirc;beyond&acirc; the line&acirc;s
endpoints.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Nmaskvalues <br>
Pass all records whose location is inside specified
geographical features. Specify if records should be skipped
(s) or kept (k) using 1 of 2 formats:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Nwet/dry.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Nocean/land/lake/island/pond.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[Default is s/k/s/k/s (i.e.,
s/k), which passes all points on dry land].</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Rxmin/xmax/ymin/ymax[+r][+uunit]
(more &acirc;&brvbar;) <br>
Specify the region of interest. If no map projection is
supplied we implicitly set -Jx1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V[level] (more &acirc;&brvbar;)
<br>
Select verbosity level [c].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Zmin[/max][+ccol] <br>
Pass all records whose 3rd column (z; col = 2) lies within
the given range or is NaN (use -s to skip NaN records). If
max is omitted then we test if z equals min instead. <br>
Input file must have at least three columns. To indicate no
limit on min or max, specify a hyphen (-). If your 3rd
column is absolute time then remember to supply -f2T. To
<br>
specify another column, append +ccol, and to specify several
tests just repeat the Z option as many times has you have
columns to test. Note: when more than one Z option <br>
is given then the Iz option cannot be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-bi[ncols][t] (more
&acirc;&brvbar;) <br>
Select native binary input. [Default is 2 input
columns].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-bo[ncols][type] (more
&acirc;&brvbar;) <br>
Select native binary output. [Default is same as input].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d[i|o]nodata (more
&acirc;&brvbar;) <br>
Replace input columns that equal nodata with NaN and do the
reverse on output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e[~]&acirc;pattern&acirc; |
-e[~]/regexp/[i] (more &acirc;&brvbar;) <br>
Only accept data records that match the given pattern.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f[i|o]colinfo (more
&acirc;&brvbar;) <br>
Specify data types of input and/or output columns.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g[a]x|y|d|X|Y|D|[col]z[+|-]gap[u]
(more &acirc;&brvbar;) <br>
Determine data gaps and line breaks.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h[i|o][n][+c][+d][+rremark][+rtitle]
(more &acirc;&brvbar;) <br>
Skip or produce header record(s).</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-icols[+l][+sscale][+ooffset][,&acirc;&brvbar;]
(more &acirc;&brvbar;) <br>
Select input columns and transformations (0 is first
column).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ocols[,&acirc;&brvbar;] (more
&acirc;&brvbar;) <br>
Select output columns (0 is first column).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s[cols][a|r] (more
&acirc;&brvbar;) <br>
Set handling of NaN records.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-:[i|o] (more &acirc;&brvbar;)
<br>
Swap 1st and 2nd column on input and/or output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-^ or just - <br>
Print a short message about the syntax of the command, then
exits (NOTE: on Windows just use -).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-+ or just + <br>
Print an extensive usage (help) message, including the
explanation of any module-specific option (but not the GMT
common options), then exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-? or no arguments <br>
Print a complete usage (help) message, including the
explanation of all options, then exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UNITS <br>
For map distance unit, append unit d for arc degree, m for
arc minute, and s for arc second, or e for meter [Default],
f for foot, k for km, M for statute mile, n for nautical
<br>
mile, and u for US survey foot. By default we compute such
distances using a spherical approximation with great
circles. Prepend - to a distance (or the unit is no distance
is <br>
given) to perform &acirc;Flat Earth&acirc; calculations
(quicker but less accurate) or prepend + to perform exact
geodesic calculations (slower but more accurate).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ASCII FORMAT PRECISION <br>
The ASCII output formats of numerical data are controlled by
parameters in your gmt.conf file. Longitude and latitude are
formatted according to FORMAT_GEO_OUT, absolute time is <br>
under the control of FORMAT_DATE_OUT and FORMAT_CLOCK_OUT,
whereas general floating point values are formatted
according to FORMAT_FLOAT_OUT. Be aware that the format in
effect <br>
can lead to loss of precision in ASCII output, which can
lead to various problems downstream. If you find the output
is not written with enough precision, consider switching to
<br>
binary output (-bo if available) or specify more decimals
using the FORMAT_FLOAT_OUT setting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This note applies to ASCII
output only in combination with binary or netCDF input or
the -: option. See also the note below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE ON PROCESSING ASCII INPUT
RECORDS <br>
Unless you are using the -: option, selected ASCII input
records are copied verbatim to output. That means that
options like -foT and settings like FORMAT_FLOAT_OUT and
FOR&acirc; <br>
MAT_GEO_OUT will not have any effect on the output. On the
other hand, it allows selecting records with diverse
content, including character strings, quoted or not,
comments, and <br>
other non-numerical content.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE ON DISTANCES <br>
If options -C or -L are selected then distances are
Cartesian and in user units; use -fg to imply spherical
distances in km and geographical (lon, lat) coordinates.
Alterna&acirc; <br>
tively, specify -R and -J to measure projected Cartesian
distances in map units (cm, inch, or points, as determined
by PROJ_LENGTH_UNIT).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This program has evolved over
the years. Originally, the -R and -J were mandatory in order
to handle geographic data, but now there is full support for
spherical calculations. <br>
Thus, -J should only be used if you want the tests to be
applied on projected data and not the original coordinates.
If -J is used the distances given via -C and -L are
projected <br>
distances.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE ON SEGMENTS <br>
Segment headers in the input files are copied to output if
one or more records from a segment passes the test.
Selection is always done point by point, not by segment.
That <br>
means only points from a segment that pass the test will be
included in the output. If you wish to clip the lines and
include the new boundary points at the segment ends you <br>
must use gmtspatial instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
To extract the subset of data set that is within 300 km of
any of the points in pts.txt but more than 100 km away from
the lines in lines.txt, run</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gmt select lonlatfile -fg
-Cpts.txt+d300k -Llines.txt+d100k -Il &gt; subset</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here, you must specify -fg so
the program knows you are processing geographical data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To keep all points in data.txt
within the specified region, except the points on land (as
determined by the high-resolution coastlines), use</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gmt select data.txt
-R120/121/22/24 -Dh -Nk/s &gt; subset</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To return all points in
quakes.txt that are inside or on the spherical polygon
lonlatpath.txt, try</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gmt select quakes.txt
-Flonlatpath.txt -fg &gt; subset1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To return all points in
stations.txt that are within 5 cm of the point in origin.txt
for a certain projection, try</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gmt select stations.txt
-Corigin.txt+d5 -R20/50/-10/20 -JM20c --PROJ_LENGTH_UNIT=cm
&gt; subset2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To return all points in
quakes.txt that are inside the grid topo.nc where the values
are nonzero, try</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gmt select quakes.txt -Gtopo.nc
&gt; subset2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GSHHS INFORMATION <br>
The coastline database is GSHHG (formerly GSHHS) which is
compiled from three sources: World Vector Shorelines (WVS),
CIA World Data Bank II (WDBII), and Atlas of the Cryosphere
<br>
(AC, for Antarctica only). Apart from Antarctica, all
level-1 polygons (ocean-land boundary) are derived from the
more accurate WVS while all higher level polygons (level
2-4, <br>
representing land/lake, lake/island-in-lake, and
island-in-lake/lake-in-island-in-lake boundaries) are taken
from WDBII. The Antarctica coastlines come in two flavors:
ice-front <br>
or grounding line, selectable via the -A option. Much
processing has taken place to convert WVS, WDBII, and AC
data into usable form for GMT: assembling closed polygons
from <br>
line segments, checking for duplicates, and correcting for
crossings between polygons. The area of each polygon has
been determined so that the user may choose not to draw
fea&acirc; <br>
tures smaller than a minimum area (see -A); one may also
limit the highest hierarchical level of polygons to be
included (4 is the maximum). The 4 lower-resolution
databases were <br>
derived from the full resolution database using the
Douglas-Peucker line-simplification algorithm. The
classification of rivers and borders follow that of the
WDBII. See the GMT <br>
Cookbook and Technical Reference Appendix K for further
details.</p>
