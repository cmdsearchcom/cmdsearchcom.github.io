<p>PMVAL(1) General Commands Manual PMVAL(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pmval, pmevent - arbitrary performance metrics value
dumper</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pmval [-dgLrvz] [-A align] [-a archive] [-f N] [-h host] [-i
instances] [-K spec] [-n pmnsfile] [-O offset] [-p port] [-S
starttime] [-s samples] [-T endtime] [-t interval] [-U <br>
archive] [-w width] [-x pattern] [-Z timezone]
metricname</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
pmval prints current or archived values for the nominated
performance metric. The metric of interest is named in the
metricname argument, subject to instance qualification with
<br>
the -i flag as described below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unless directed to another host
by the -h option, or to a set of archives by the -a or -U
options, pmval will contact the Performance Metrics
Collector Daemon (PMCD) on the local <br>
host to obtain the required information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The metricname argument may also
be given in the metric specification syntax, as described in
PCPIntro(1), where the source, metric and instance may all
be included in the met&acirc; <br>
ricname, e.g. thathost:kernel.all.load[&quot;1
minute&quot;]. When this format is used, none of the -h or
-a or -U options may be specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When using the metric
specification syntax, the
&lsquo;&lsquo;hostname&rsquo;&rsquo; @ is treated specially
and causes pmval to use a local context to collect metrics
from PMDAs on the local host with&acirc; <br>
out PMCD. Only some metrics are available in this mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When processing a set of
archives, pmval may relinquish its own timing control, and
operate as a &lsquo;&lsquo;slave&rsquo;&rsquo; of a
pmtime(1) process that uses a GUI dialog to provide timing
con&acirc; <br>
trol. In this case, either the -g option should be used to
start pmval as the sole slave of a new pmtime(1) instance,
or -p should be used to attach pmval to an existing <br>
pmtime(1) instance via the IPC channel identified by the
port argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -S, -T, -O and -A options
may be used to define a time window to restrict the samples
retrieved, set an initial origin within the time window, or
specify a &lsquo;&lsquo;natural&rsquo;&rsquo; align&acirc;
<br>
ment of the sample times; refer to PCPIntro(1) for a
complete description of these options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The other options which control
the source, timing and layout of the information reported by
pmval are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a Performance metric values are
retrieved from the set of Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) archive
logs identified. The argument is a comma-separated list of
names, each of which <br>
may be the base name of an archive or the name of a
directory containing one or more archives. See also -U.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d When replaying from a set of
archives, this option requests that the prevailing real-time
delay be applied between samples (see -t) to effect a pause,
rather than the <br>
default behaviour of replaying at full speed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Numbers are reported in
&lsquo;&lsquo;fixed point&rsquo;&rsquo; notation, rather
than the default scientific notation. Each number will be up
to the column width determined by the default heuris&acirc;
<br>
tics, else the -w option if specified, and include N digits
after the decimal point. So, the options -f 3 -w 8 would
produce numbers of the form 9999.999. A value of zero <br>
for N omits the decimal point and any fractional digits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g Start pmval as the slave of a
new pmtime(1) process for replay of archived performance
data using the pmtime(1) graphical user interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Current performance metric
values are retrieved from the nominated host machine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i instances is a list of one or
more instance names for the nominated performance metric -
just these instances will be retrieved and reported (the
default is to report all <br>
instances). The list must be a single argument, with
elements of the list separated by commas and/or white
space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The instance name may be quoted
with single (&rsquo;) or double (&quot;) quotes for those
cases where the instance name contains white space or
commas.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Multiple -i options are allowed
as an alternative way of specifying more than one instance
of interest.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As an example, the following are
all equivalent:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ pmval -i &quot;&rsquo;1
minute&rsquo;,&rsquo;5 minute&rsquo;&quot; kernel.all.load
<br>
$ pmval -i &rsquo;&quot;1 minute&quot;,&quot;5
minute&quot;&rsquo; kernel.all.load <br>
$ pmval -i &quot;&rsquo;1 minute&rsquo; &rsquo;5
minute&rsquo;&quot; kernel.all.load <br>
$ pmval -i &quot;&rsquo;1 minute&rsquo;&quot; -i
&quot;&rsquo;5 minute&rsquo;&quot; kernel.all.load <br>
$ pmval &rsquo;localhost:kernel.all.load[&quot;1
minute&quot;,&quot;5 minute&quot;]&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-K When fetching metrics from a
local context, the -K option may be used to control the DSO
PMDAs that should be made accessible. The spec argument
conforms to the syntax <br>
described in __pmSpecLocalPMDA(3). More than one -K option
may be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Normally pmval operates on
the default Performance Metrics Name Space (PMNS), however
if the -n option is specified an alternative namespace is
loaded from the file pmns&acirc; <br>
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p Attach pmval to an existing
pmtime(1) time control process instance via the IPC channel
identified by the port argument. This option is normally
only used by other tools, <br>
e.g. pmchart(1), when they launch pmval with synchronized
time control.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Print raw values for
cumulative counter metrics. Normally cumulative counter
metrics are converted to rates. For example, disk transfers
are reported as number of disk <br>
transfers per second during the preceding sample interval,
rather than the raw value of number of disk transfers since
the machine was booted. If you specify this option, <br>
the raw metric values are printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s The argument samples defines
the number of samples to be retrieved and reported. If
samples is 0 or -s is not specified, pmval will sample and
report continuously (in real <br>
time mode) or until the end of the set of PCP archives (in
archive mode).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t The default update interval
may be set to something other than the default 1 second. The
interval argument follows the syntax described in
PCPIntro(1), and in the simplest <br>
form may be an unsigned integer (the implied units in this
case are seconds).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U Performance metric values are
retrieved from the set of Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) archive
logs identified. The argument is a comma-separated list of
names, each of which <br>
may be the base name of an archive or the name of a
directory containing one or more archives. However, unlike
-a every recorded value in the archive for the selected
met&acirc; <br>
ric and instances is reported (so no interpolation mode, and
the sample interval (-t option) is ignored. See also -a.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At most one of the options -a
and -U may be specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w Set the width of each column
of output to be width columns. If not specified columns are
wide enough to accommodate the largest value of the type
being printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x The given pattern is sent to
the performance metric domain agent for the requested
metricname before any values are requested. This serves two
purposes. Firstly, it pro&acirc; <br>
vides a mechanism for server-side event filtering that is
customisable for individual event streams. In addition, some
performance metrics domain agents also use the PMCD <br>
store mechanism to provide a basic security model (e.g. for
sensitive log files, only a client host with pmStore(3)
access would be able to access the event stream).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As pattern may be processed by
regcomp(3) it should be a non-empty string. Use . (dot) for
a &acirc;match all&acirc; pattern.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Z By default, pmval reports the
time of day according to the local timezone on the system
where pmval is run. The -Z option changes the timezone to
timezone in the format of <br>
the environment variable TZ as described in environ(7).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z Change the reporting timezone
to the local timezone at the host that is the source of the
performance metrics, as identified via either the metricname
or the -h or -a or -U <br>
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following symbols may
occasionally appear, in place of a metric value, in pmval
output: A question mark symbol (?) indicates that a value is
no longer available for that <br>
metric instance. An exclamation mark (!) indicates that a
64-bit counter wrapped during the sample.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The output from pmval is
directed to standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
$PCP_VAR_DIR/pmns/* <br>
default PMNS specification files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PCP ENVIRONMENT <br>
Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP. On
each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local
<br>
values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF variable may be
used to specify an alternative configuration file, as
described in pcp.conf(5).</p>

<br>
pcp.env(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
All are generated on standard error and are intended to be
self-explanatory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CAVEATS <br>
By default, pmval attempts to display non-integer numeric
values in a way that does not distort the inherent precision
(rarely more than 4 significant digits), and tries to
main&acirc; <br>
tain a tabular format in the output. These goals are
sometimes in conflict.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the absence of the -f option
(described above), the following table describes the formats
used for different ranges of numeric values for any metric
that is of type <br>
PM_TYPE_FLOAT or PM_TYPE_DOUBLE, or any metric that has the
semantics of a counter (for which pmval reports the rate
converted value):</p>
