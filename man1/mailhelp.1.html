<p>MAILHELP(1) General Commands Manual MAILHELP(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
maildist, mailhelp, maillist, mailpatch - mailagent&rsquo;s
commands</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
maildist address system [ version ] <br>
mailhelp [ address ] <br>
maillist [ address ] <br>
mailpatch address system version patchlist</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
These commands are not intended to be run directly by a
user. They may appear in any mail whose subject is set to
Command. Such a mail will be processed by the mailagent(1),
<br>
which will extract all lines beginning with @SH, followed by
one of the above commands. The mailagent first sets
environment variables that will be used by every
commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Maildist is used to mail a whole
distribution to the given address. The version number may be
omitted if the system has no version specified !! Maildist
looks for the Spool/dis&acirc; <br>
tribs file to find where the distribution is located. If it
has been archived, the file name extension is used to guess
how the archive will be restored:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">.cpio archive is a cpio archive
<br>
.tar archive is in tar format <br>
.cpio.Z compressed cpio archive <br>
.tar.Z compressed tar archive</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that on file systems with
short file names, the final .Z extension could be dropped.
Therefore, compressed archives must be explicitly stated in
the Spool/distribs file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once the directory is found (or
extracted), maildist looks for a .package file. If one is
found, then it is assumed this distribution is under control
of the dist 3.0 package, <br>
and the makedist command is called to actually mirror the
source tree (makedist being part of dist 3.0).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Otherwise, it looks for a
MANIFEST file. If it finds one, only the files listed
therein will be sent. Otherwise, all the files will be sent,
excepted the binary executables and <br>
object files, the RCS sub-directories or RCS files, the
private U subdirectory and the .package file, any core file
or files in a bugs subdirectory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Then, the following algorithm is
used: if no RCS file is found, the file is sent as-is.
Otherwise, we look for a defined &rsquo;lastpat&rsquo;
symbol. If it is found, the corresponding <br>
revision is checked-out and sent. Otherwise, the
last-revision on the default branch is exctracted, provided
that the corresponding working file is not found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The maildist command will not
work if the system is tagged as an old one (with an o in the
patches column of the distribs file). A message will be sent
back to the user, explain&acirc; <br>
ing that only patches are available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mailhelp sends help to the
address (if omitted, the return path of the mail is used).
The help text is found in Spool/agenthelp. It should have
been correctly set in the instal&acirc; <br>
lation procedure, as explained in the mailagent(1) manual
page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Maillist sends the list of
available distributions, with current patchlevels if
necessary. The Spool/distribs and Spool/proglist files are
both used to build the list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mailpatch sends one or more
patches for a maintained distribution. The directory or the
archive is found by scanning Spool/distribs. The bugs
sub-directory must then hold the <br>
available patches. The patches may be stored in compressed
form (with the ending .Z), as mailpatch knows about them and
will uncompress the patch before sending.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Patches for old systems are kept
in a separate directory, either in normal or in compressed
form. If the version number of the old system is x.y, then
the directory must be named <br>
bugs-x.y and placed in the root directory of the system,
just like bugs is.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Whenever the user asks for an
old system, mailpatch inserts a little note giving the
latest version number for that system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE <br>
For a more accurate description of these commands
(user&rsquo;s point of vue), you may want to have a look at
the help file or send help to yourself using the mailhelp
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FORWARDING <br>
When the author of a package wishes to relinquish all
maintenance duty, he is most often stuck by the weight of
the past: Configure scripts have his e-mail address
hardwired (see <br>
unit MailAuthor.U) and Command messages for package
registration and/or patch requests will continue to reach
him.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The answer to that is to leave a
.forward file at the top of the package tree and commands
will automatically forge new requests and forward them to
the address listed in the <br>
.forward file. Now the recipient surely needs a mailagent at
the other end to deal with forwarded requests!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Only plain e-mail address(es)
are allowed in the .forward. The &quot;|command&quot;
processing hook is not supported, since it&rsquo;s not
sendmail which interprets that file but the command <br>
itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Forwarding applies to maildist,
mailpatch and package commands only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
~/.mailagent configuration file for mailagent. <br>
/usr/share/mailagent <br>
directory holding templates and samples. <br>
Spool/agenthelp help file <br>
Spool/distribs distribution list <br>
Spool/proglist comments for available distributions <br>
Spool/plsave records patchlevel of archived distributions
<br>
Log/agentlog mailagent&rsquo;s log file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
The proglist file ought to make a distinction between
different versions of a same system.</p>
