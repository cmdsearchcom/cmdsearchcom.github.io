<p>XPLANET(1) General Commands Manual XPLANET(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
xplanet - render an image of a planet into an X window or
file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
xplanet [options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Xplanet is similar to Xearth, where an image of the earth is
rendered into an X window. All of the major planets and most
satellites can be drawn. A number of different map <br>
projections are also supported, including azimuthal,
Mercator, Mollweide, orthographic, and rectangular. The
latest version can always be found at
http://xplanet.source&acirc; <br>
forge.net.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Options need only be specified with enough characters to be
unambiguous. Valid options to Xplanet are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-arc_file <br>
Specify an arc file to be plotted against the background
stars. Each line in the file must have the following
syntax:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dec1 ra1 dec2 ra2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where declination is in degrees
and right ascension is in hours. This option has no effect
if -projection is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-arc_spacing spacing <br>
When drawing an arc, draw line segments that are spacing
degrees apart. The default is 0.1 degrees. Line segments
shorter than spacing will not be drawn.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-arc_thickness thickness <br>
Specify the thickness of arcs. The default is 1 pixel. When
drawing arcs on a planet using the arc_file option in the
configuration file, use the arc_thickness option <br>
there too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-background background_file <br>
Use background_file as the background image, with the planet
to be superimposed upon it. A color may also be supplied
(e.g. -background &quot;navy blue&quot; or -background <br>
0xff00ff).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-base_magnitude magnitude <br>
A star of the specified magnitude will have a pixel
brightness of 1. The default value is 10. Stars will be
drawn more brightly if this number is larger.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-body body <br>
Render an image of the specified planet or satellite. Valid
values for body are sun, mercury, venus, earth, moon, mars,
phobos, deimos, jupiter, io, europa, ganymede, <br>
callisto, saturn, mimas, enceladus, tethys, dione, rhea,
titan, hyperion, iapetus, phoebe, uranus, miranda, ariel,
umbriel, titania, oberon, neptune, triton, nereid, <br>
pluto, charon, random, and major.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The field of view can also be
centered on a satellite location using &quot;naif&quot; or
&quot;norad&quot;, along with the satellite id. For example,
&quot;-body naif-82&quot; will center the field of <br>
view on NAIF ID -82, which is the Cassini orbiter. Xplanet
must be compiled with SPICE support and the required kernels
must be present. See the README in the spice sub&acirc; <br>
directory for more details. Using &quot;-body
norad20580&quot; will center the field of view on NORAD ID
20580, which is the Hubble Space Telescope. The appropriate
TLE files must <br>
be present in this case. See the README in the satellites
subdirectory for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using &quot;path&quot; will
center the field of view on the direction of motion of the
origin. This direction is relative to the direction of
motion of the body specified by <br>
-path_relative_to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Earth is the default body. This
option is the same as -target.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-center +x+y <br>
Place the center of the rendered body at pixel coordinates
(x, y). The upper left corner of the screen is at (0,0).
Either x or y may be negative. The default value is <br>
the center of the screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-color color <br>
Set the color for the label. The default is &quot;red&quot;.
Any color in the rgb.txt file may be used. Colors may also
be specified by RGB hex values; for example -color 0xff <br>
and -color blue mean the same thing, as do -color 0xff0000
and -color red.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-config config_file <br>
Use the configuration file config_file. The format of
config_file is described in README.config. See the
description of -searchdir to see where xplanet looks in
order to <br>
find the configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-create_scattering_tables
scattering_file <br>
Create lookup tables for Rayleigh scattering. See the README
in the scattering directory for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-date YYYYMMDD.HHMMSS <br>
Use the date specified instead of the current local time.
The date is assumed to be GMT.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-date_format string <br>
Specify the format for the date/time label. This format
string is passed to strftime(3). The default is &quot;%c
%Z&quot;, which shows the date, time, and time zone in the
<br>
locale&rsquo;s appropriate date and time representation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dynamic_origin file <br>
Specify an observer location. The location is relative to
the body specified with -origin (by default, this is the
Sun). The last line of the file must be of the form</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">YYYYMMDD.HHMMSS range lat lon
localtime</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">19951207.120000 10.328 -3.018
97.709 9.595</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The specified time is ignored
and the current time is used. The range is in planetary
radii, and lat and lon are in degrees. Localtime (in hours)
is optional, but if <br>
present, it will be used in place of the longitude. Only the
last line of the file is used. This file may be updated
between renderings using a script executed with the <br>
-prev_command or -post_command options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ephemeris_file filename <br>
Specify a JPL digital ephemeris file (DE200, DE405, or
DE406) to use for computing planetary positions. Xplanet
uses Bill Gray&rsquo;s code (http://www.project&acirc; <br>
pluto.com/jpl_eph.htm), which reads both big and little
endian binary files. The ephemeris files found at
ftp://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/eph/export/unix are big endian
files, <br>
but you do not need to do any additional byte-swapping to
use them. See the description of -searchdir to see where
xplanet looks in order to find the ephemeris file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-font fontname <br>
Set the font for the label. Only TrueType fonts are
supported. If the -pango option is used, fontname is taken
to be the font family name (e.g. &quot;Arial&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fontsize size <br>
Specify the point size. The default is 12.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fork Detach from the
controlling terminal. This is useful on MS Windows to run
xplanet from a batch file without having to keep a DOS
window open. Be careful when using this <br>
option; it&rsquo;s easy to have multiple processes running
at the same time without knowing it - check the Task
Manager. On unix systems this is pretty much the same as
running <br>
xplanet in the background.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fov Specify the field of view,
in degrees. This option and the -radius option are mutually
exclusive. This option has no effect if the -projection
option is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-geometry string <br>
Specify the image geometry using the standard X window
geometry syntax,
[&lt;width&gt;{xX}&lt;height&gt;][{+-}&lt;xoffset&gt;{+-}&lt;yoffset&gt;]
(e.g. 256x256-10+10 puts a window 256x256 pixels <br>
in size 10 pixels away from the right side and 10 pixels
below the top of the root window). The root window outside
of the image will be black. This option may be used <br>
with -window or -output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-glare radius <br>
Draw a glare around the sun with with a radius of the
specified value larger than the sun. The default value is
28.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-gmtlabel <br>
Same as the -label option, but show GMT instead of local
time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-grs_longitude lon <br>
The longitude of Jupiter&rsquo;s Great Red Spot (GRS). A
typical value is 94 degrees. If this option is specified,
longitudes on Jupiter will be calculated in System II
coor&acirc; <br>
dinates. By default, longitudes are calculated in System III
coordinates. When using this option, use an image map for
Jupiter where the center of the GRS is at the <br>
pixel 0 column, or the left side of the image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-hibernate seconds <br>
After the screen has been idle for the specified number of
seconds, xplanet will sleep. This option requires xplanet to
have been compiled with the X Screensaver exten&acirc; <br>
sion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-idlewait seconds <br>
Don&rsquo;t run Xplanet unless the screen has been idle for
the specified number of seconds. This option requires
xplanet to have been compiled with the X Screensaver
exten&acirc; <br>
sion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-interpolate_origin_file <br>
This option is only useful in conjunction with -origin_file.
It computes the observer position at the current time by
interpolating between values specified in the origin <br>
file. This is useful if you have spacecraft positions
tabulated in an origin file, but want a real time view.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-jdate Julian date <br>
Use the specified Julian date instead of the current local
time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-label Display a label in the
upper right corner.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-labelpos <br>
Specify the location of the label using the standard X
window geometry syntax. The default position is
&quot;-15+15&quot;, or 15 pixels to the left and below the
top right corner <br>
of the display. This option implies -label.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-label_altitude <br>
Display the altitude above the surface instead of distance
from the body center in the label.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-label_body body <br>
Use the specified body to calculate the sub-observer,
sub-solar, and illumination values in the label. This is
useful with the -separation option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-label_string <br>
Specify the text of the first line of the label. By default,
it says something like &quot;Looking at Earth&quot;. Any
instances of %t will be replaced by the target name, and any
<br>
instances of %o will be replaced by the origin name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-latitude latitude <br>
Render the target body as seen from above the specified
latitude (in degrees). The default value is 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-light_time <br>
Account for the time it takes for light to travel from the
target body to the observer. The default is to ignore the
effects of light time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-localtime localtime <br>
Place the observer above the longitude where the local time
is the specified value. 0 is midnight and 12 is noon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-log_magstep step <br>
Increase the brightness of a star by 10^step for each
integer decrease in magnitude. The default value is 0.4.
This means that a star of magnitude 2 is 10^0.4 (about <br>
2.5) times brighter than a star of magnitude 3. A larger
number makes stars brighter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-longitude longitude <br>
Place the observer above the specified longitude (in
degrees). Longitude is positive going east, negative going
west (for the earth and moon), so for example Los Angeles
<br>
is at -118 or 242. The default value is 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-make_cloud_maps <br>
If there is an entry in the config file for cloud_map,
xplanet will output a day and night image with clouds
overlaid and then exit. The images will be created in the
<br>
directory specified by -tmpdir, or in the current directory
if -tmpdir is not used. The names of the output images
default to day_clouds.jpg and night_clouds.jpg, but may <br>
be changed by the -output option. If &quot;-output
filename.extension&quot; is specified, the output images
will be named &quot;day_filename.extension&quot; and
&quot;night_filename.extension&quot;. <br>
The dimensions of the output images are the same as the day
image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-marker_file <br>
Specify a file containing user defined marker data to
display against the background stars. The format of each
line is generally declination, right ascension, string, as
<br>
in the example below:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-16.7161 6.7525
&quot;Sirius&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For additional options which may
be specified, see the marker_file entry in README.config.
This option has no effect if -projection is specified. This
option is not <br>
meant for city markers; for that use the marker_file option
in the configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-markerbounds filename <br>
Write coordinates of the bounding box for each marker to
filename. This might be useful if you&rsquo;re using xplanet
to make imagemaps for web pages. Each line looks like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">204,312 277,324 Los Angeles</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where the coordinates are for
the upper left and lower right corners of the box. This file
gets rewritten every time xplanet renders its image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-north north_type <br>
This option rotates the image so that the top points to
north_type. Valid values for north_type are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">body: body&rsquo;s north pole
<br>
galactic: galactic north pole <br>
orbit: body&rsquo;s orbital north pole (perpendicular to the
orbit plane) <br>
path: origin&rsquo;s velocity vector (also see
-path_relative_to option) <br>
separation: perpendicular to the line of sight and the <br>
target-separation target line (see -separation option)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default value is
&quot;body&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-num_times num_times <br>
Run num_times before exiting. The default is to run
indefinitely.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-origin body <br>
Place the observer at the center of the specified body.
Valid values are the same as for -target. In addition,
&quot;above&quot;, &quot;below&quot;, or &quot;system&quot;
may be specified. Using <br>
&quot;above&quot; or &quot;below&quot; centers the view on
the body&rsquo;s primary and the field of view is large
enough to show the body&rsquo;s orbit. Using
&quot;system&quot; places the observer at the center <br>
of a random body in the same system as the target body. Two
bodies are in the same system if one of the following is
true:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1) target and origin have same
primary <br>
2) target is origin&rsquo;s primary <br>
3) origin is target&rsquo;s primary</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the body name is preceded by
a dash, the observer is placed on the opposite side of the
target from the specified body at a distance equal to the
distance between the <br>
target and body. For example, -target earth -origin sun
places the observer at the center of the sun. If -target
earth -origin -sun is used, the observer is placed on a <br>
line connecting the centers of the earth and sun at a
distance of 1 AU farther from the sun than the earth.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-origin_file origin_file <br>
Specify a list of observer positions in origin_file. The
positions are relative to the body specified with -origin
(by default, this is the Sun). Each line should be of <br>
the form</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">YYYYMMDD.HHMMSS range lat lon
localtime</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">19951207.120000 10.328 -3.018
97.709 9.595</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Range is in planetary radii, and
lat and lon are in degrees. The date is the only required
value. If the localtime (in hours) is supplied, it will be
used in place of <br>
the longitude. For each line in the origin file, the
observer is placed at the specified position, relative to
the body specified with -origin. This option is useful for
<br>
showing spacecraft flybys or orbiting around a planet. Any
line with a # in the first column is ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-output filename <br>
Output to a file instead of rendering to a window. The file
format is taken from the extension. Currently .gif, .jpg,
.ppm, .png, and .tiff images can be created, if <br>
xplanet has been compiled with the appropriate libraries.
The image size defaults to 512 by 512 pixels but this may be
changed by the -geometry flag. If used with the <br>
-num_times option, each output file will be numbered
sequentially.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-output_map filename <br>
Output the intermediate rectangular map that is created in
the process of rendering the final image. It will have the
same dimensions as the default day map.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-output_start_index index <br>
Start numbering output files at index. The default is 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pango Use the Pango
(http://www.pango.org) library for rendering
internationalized text. Pango uses Unicode for all of its
encoding, and will eventually support output in all <br>
the worlds major languages. If xplanet has not been compiled
with this library this option will be ignored. There appear
to be memory leaks in the pango library, so I <br>
don&rsquo;t recommend letting xplanet run indefinitely with
this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-path_relative_to body <br>
Only used with -north path or -target path. The
origin&rsquo;s velocity vector is calculated relative to the
specified body. By default, this is the Sun.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-post_command command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-prev_command command <br>
Run command either before or after each time xplanet renders
an image. On MS Windows, you may need to use unix-style
paths. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xplanet.exe -prev_command
./prev.bat</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-print_ephemeris <br>
Print the heliocentric rectangular equatorial coordinates
(J2000) for each body xplanet knows about, and then
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-projection projection_type <br>
The projection type may be one of ancient, azimuthal, bonne,
equal_area, gnomonic, hemisphere, lambert, mercator,
mollweide, orthographic, peters, polyconic, rectangular,
<br>
or tsc. The default is no projection. Multiple bodies will
not be shown if this option is specified, although shadows
will still be drawn.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-proj_param value <br>
Pass additional parameters for some projections. The only
projections that use this option at present are the Bonne,
Gnomonic, and Mercator projections. The Bonne pro&acirc;
<br>
jection is conformal at the specified latitude. Higher
values lead to a thinner heart shape. The default is 50
degrees. The Gnomonic and Mercator projections use the <br>
specified latitude as the boundaries of the projection. The
defaults are 45 and 80 degrees, respectively. This option
may be used more than once for future projections <br>
that require additional parameters. Only the first value is
used at present.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-quality quality <br>
This option is only used when creating JPEG images. The
quality can range from 0 to 100. The default value is
80.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-radius radius <br>
Specify the radius of the globe as a percent of the screen
height. The default value is 45% of the screen height. When
drawing Saturn, the radius value applies to the <br>
radius of the outer ring.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-random <br>
Place the observer above a random latitude and
longitude.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-range range <br>
Render the globe as seen from a distance of range from the
planet&rsquo;s center, in units of the planetary radius. The
default value is 1000. Note that if you use very close <br>
ranges the field of view of the screen can be greater than
180 degrees! If you want an &quot;up close&quot; image use
the -radius option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-rotate angle <br>
Rotate the globe by angle degrees counterclockwise so that
north (as defined by the -north argument) isn&rsquo;t at the
top. The default value is 0. My friends in the Southern <br>
Hemisphere can use -rotate 180 to make the earth look like
it should! For non-orthographic projections, the globe is
rotated and then projected, if that helps you visual&acirc;
<br>
ize what to expect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-save_desktop_file <br>
On Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X, xplanet creates an
intermediate image file which is used to set the desktop.
This file will be created in the -tmpdir directory. By <br>
default, this image is removed after the desktop has been
set. Specifying this option will leave the file in
place.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-searchdir directory <br>
Any files used by xplanet should be placed in one of the
following directories depending on its type:
&quot;arcs&quot;, &quot;config&quot;, &quot;ephemeris&quot;,
&quot;fonts&quot;, &quot;images&quot;, &quot;markers&quot;,
&quot;ori&acirc; <br>
gin&quot;, &quot;satellites&quot;, or &quot;stars&quot;. By
default, xplanet will look for a file in the following
order:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The current directory <br>
searchdir <br>
subdirectories of searchdir <br>
subdirectories of xplanet (if it exists in the current
directory) <br>
subdirectories of ${HOME}/.xplanet on X11 <br>
subdirectories of ${HOME}/Library/Xplanet on Mac OS X <br>
subdirectories of DATADIR/xplanet</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DATADIR is set at compile time
and defaults to /usr/local/share.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-separation body:dist <br>
Place the observer at a location where the target body and
the separation body are dist degrees apart. For example
&quot;-target earth -separation moon:-3&quot; means place
the <br>
observer at a location where the moon appears 3 degrees to
the left of the earth.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-spice_ephemeris index <br>
Use SPICE kernels to compute the position of the named body.
The index is the naif ID code (e.g. 599 for Jupiter). The
-spice_file option must be used to supply the <br>
names of the kernel files. This option may be used more than
once for different bodies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-spice_file spice_file <br>
Specify a file containing a list of objects to display. A
file containing a list of SPICE kernels to read named
spice_file.krn must exist along with spice_file. See the
<br>
README in the &quot;spice&quot; subdirectory for more
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-starfreq frequency <br>
Fraction of background pixels that will be colored white.
The default value is 0.001. This option is only meaningful
with the azimuthal, mollweide, orthographic, and <br>
peters projections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-starmap starmap <br>
Use starmap to draw the background stars. This file should
be a text file where each line has the following format:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Declination, Right Ascension,
Magnitude</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where Declination is in decimal
degrees and Right Ascension is in decimal hours. For
example, the entry for Sirius is</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-16.7161 6.7525 -1.46</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See the description of
-searchdir to see where xplanet looks in order to find the
star map.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-target target <br>
Same as -body.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-tt Use terrestrial time instead
of universal time. The two differ slightly due to the
non-uniform rotation of the earth. The default is to use
universal time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-timewarp <br>
As in xearth, scale the apparent rate at which time
progresses by factor. The default is 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-tmpdir tmpdir <br>
Specify a directory that xplanet will use to place images
created using -make_cloud_maps. On Microsoft Windows,
xplanet will write a bitmap file called xplanet.bmp to the
<br>
specified directory. The default is the result of the
GetWindowsDirectory call (C:WINDOWS on Win95). On Mac OS X,
xplanet will create an intermediate PNG file in order <br>
to set the background. The default value is /tmp. On Windows
and Mac OS X, the intermediate file will be removed unless
the -save_desktop_file option is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-transparency <br>
Update the background pixmap for transparent Eterms and
aterms. This option only works under X11.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-transpng filename <br>
Same as the -output option, except set the background to be
transparent when writing a PNG file.</p>
