<p>DEBRELEASE(1) General Commands Manual DEBRELEASE(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
debrelease - a wrapper around dupload or dput</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
debrelease [debrelease options] [dupload/dput options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
debrelease is a simple wrapper around dupload or dput. It is
called from within the source code tree of a package, and
figures out the current version of a package. It then <br>
looks for the corresponding .changes file (which lists the
files needed to upload in order to release the package) in
the parent directory of the source code tree and calls <br>
dupload or dput with the .changes file as parameter in order
to perform the actual uploading.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options may be given to
debrelease; except for the ones listed below, they are
passed on unchanged to dupload or dput. The devscripts
configuration files are also read by debre&acirc; <br>
lease as described below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Directory name checking <br>
In common with several other scripts in the devscripts
package, debrelease will climb the directory tree until it
finds a debian/changelog file. As a safeguard against stray
<br>
files causing potential problems, it will examine the name
of the parent directory once it finds the debian/changelog
file, and check that the directory name corresponds to the
<br>
package name. Precisely how it does this is controlled by
two configuration file variables
DEVSCRIPTS_CHECK_DIRNAME_LEVEL and
DEVSCRIPTS_CHECK_DIRNAME_REGEX, and their corre&acirc; <br>
sponding command-line options --check-dirname-level and
--check-dirname-regex.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEVSCRIPTS_CHECK_DIRNAME_LEVEL
can take the following values:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 Never check the directory
name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 Only check the directory name
if we have had to change directory in our search for
debian/changelog. This is the default behaviour.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 Always check the directory
name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The directory name is checked by
testing whether the current directory name (as determined by
pwd(1)) matches the regex given by the configuration file
option <br>
DEVSCRIPTS_CHECK_DIRNAME_REGEX or by the command line option
--check-dirname-regex regex. Here regex is a Perl regex (see
perlre(3perl)), which will be anchored at the beginning <br>
and the end. If regex contains a &rsquo;/&rsquo;, then it
must match the full directory path. If not, then it must
match the full directory name. If regex contains the string
&Acirc;&acute;PACKAGE&rsquo;, <br>
this will be replaced by the source package name, as
determined from the changelog. The default value for the
regex is: &Acirc;&acute;PACKAGE(-.+)?&rsquo;, thus matching
directory names such as <br>
PACKAGE and PACKAGE-version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
--dupload, --dput <br>
This specifies which uploader program to use; the default is
dupload.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S If this option is used, or
the default .changes file is not found but a source-only
.changes file is present, then this source-only .changes
file will be uploaded instead <br>
of an arch-specific one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-adebian-architecture,
-tGNU-system-type <br>
See dpkg-architecture(1) for a description of these options.
They affect the search for the .changes file. They are
provided to mimic the behaviour of dpkg-buildpackage <br>
when determining the name of the .changes file. If a plain
-t is given, it is taken to be the dupload host-specifying
option, and therefore signifies the end of the <br>
debrelease-specific options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--multi <br>
Multiarch .changes mode: This signifies that debrelease
should use the most recent file with the name pattern
package_version_*+*.changes as the .changes file, allowing
<br>
for the .changes files produced by dpkg-cross.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--debs-dir directory <br>
Look for the .changes and .deb files in directory instead of
the parent of the source directory. This should either be an
absolute path or relative to the top of the <br>
source directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--check-dirname-level N <br>
See the above section Directory name checking for an
explanation of this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--check-dirname-regex regex <br>
See the above section Directory name checking for an
explanation of this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-conf, --noconf <br>
Do not read any configuration files. This can only be used
as the first option given on the command-line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help, -h <br>
Display a help message and exit successfully.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Display version and copyright information and exit
successfully.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION VARIABLES <br>
The two configuration files /etc/devscripts.conf and
~/.devscripts are sourced in that order to set configuration
variables. Command line options can be used to override
config&acirc; <br>
uration file settings. Environment variable settings are
ignored for this purpose. The currently recognised variables
are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEBRELEASE_UPLOADER <br>
The currently recognised values are dupload and dput, and it
specifies which uploader program should be used. It
corresponds to the --dupload and --dput command line <br>
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEBRELEASE_DEBS_DIR <br>
This specifies the directory in which to look for the
.changes and .deb files, and is either an absolute path or
relative to the top of the source tree. This corresponds
<br>
to the --debs-dir command line option. This directive could
be used, for example, if you always use pbuilder or
svn-buildpackage to build your packages. Note that it <br>
also affects debc(1) and debi(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEVSCRIPTS_CHECK_DIRNAME_LEVEL,
DEVSCRIPTS_CHECK_DIRNAME_REGEX <br>
See the above section Directory name checking for an
explanation of these variables. Note that these are
package-wide configuration variables, and will therefore
affect <br>
all devscripts scripts which check their value, as described
in their respective manpages and in devscripts.conf(5).</p>
