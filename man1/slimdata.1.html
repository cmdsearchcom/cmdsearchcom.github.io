<p>slim(1) PHYSICS DATA COMPRESSION slim(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
slim, unslim, slimcat - Reversible compression of noisy
physics data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
slim [options] filename ... <br>
unslim [options] filename ... <br>
slimcat [options] filename ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
slim performs lossless compression on binary data files. It
is designed to operate very rapidly and achieve better
compression on noisy physics data than general-purpose tools
<br>
such as gzip and bzip2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">slim works well only on very
specific kinds of data. It requires a file that consists of
integers represented in their native 16- or 32-bit binary
format and arranged in a regu&acirc; <br>
lar repetetive pattern. Specifically, slim is designed for
the kind of enormous files produced copiously by the Atacama
Cosmology Telescope. If it works well for other types of
<br>
files and from other experiments, then so much the
better.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">slim is not now appropriate for
self-describing files containing their own meta-data (e.g.
FITS or NetCDF files). Probably the slim library could be
adapted to such files, if a <br>
front end were written to parse the meta-data to extract
details about the structure of the main data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Although slim can operate on any
file in the sense that the &quot;slimfile&quot; will
correctly expand back into the original file, good
compression performance--indeed, any compression at <br>
all--requires that slim knows specific details about the
file contents. See the Data description options on how to
describe the file contents, and RAW DATA STRUCTURE for
expla&acirc; <br>
nation of the relevant terms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">slim &quot;trains&quot; its
encoding algorithms by examining only a fraction of the
data. For example, the main algorithm (the reduced binary
encoder) works by compressing a small con&acirc; <br>
tiguous range of values at the expense of all values outside
that range. The ends of that range are selected based on
only a sample of the data. For more, see Data sampling <br>
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unslim is a synonym for slim
--expand</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">slimcat is a synonym for slim
--stdout --preserve</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
All options have short and long forms, which are listed
together here.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">General options <br>
-p, --preserve <br>
Preserve the original raw file when compressing or the
original slim file when expanding. The default behavior is
to delete the input file(s) as each output file is
suc&acirc; <br>
cessfully compressed or expanded (except when the option
--stdout is used). If this option is selected when expanding
files, then the new output file is named by replac&acirc;
<br>
ing the &quot;.slm&quot; extension with
&quot;.raw&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X, --compress <br>
The file or files given as arguments are raw files to be
compressed. The default is to assume raw files, except where
the file names end with the .slm or .SLM suffix. <br>
This option is the only way to force compression of a file
named something.slm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x, --expand <br>
The file or files given as arguments are slim files to be
expanded. The default is to assume raw files, except where
the file names end with the .slm or .SLM suffix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k, --force <br>
Force compression or expansion to overwrite any existing
file of the same name. Without this option, slim will refuse
to overwrite any files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
Print the slim file version and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-?, --help <br>
Print a usage message and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Compression options <br>
These options are ignored when expanding files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m, --method=method <br>
Use encoding method method (default = 2). The methods
are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* -m2 The reduced binary encoder
(default) <br>
* -m5 Runlength coder. Good for data where the values are
<br>
strictly identical for long periods.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All other values are reserved.
Methods numbered 1, 3, and 4 were once implemented. They all
proved wrong for the job and have been removed. Method 1 was
a slight varia&acirc; <br>
tion on the reduced binary system, differing only in how the
parameters were computed. For more on methods 2 through 5,
see ENCODING ALGORITHMS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --deltas <br>
Encoders operate on the differences between successive data
values (the deltas). Default is to operate on the data
itself. Deltas are slightly slower to encode and <br>
decode, but they compress more effectively in almost all
situations. In principle, raw data could compress to 0.5
fewer bits per data value, but this would be expected <br>
only for extremely stable channels that are not typical of
physics data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b, --permit-bitrotation <br>
Bit-rotation is an encoding feature useful in some data
streams where the lowest n bits are always the same. When
using this option, slim will check each channel for the <br>
existence of some number of constant lowest bits. If any are
found, then the data are compressed by &quot;rotating&quot;
the lowest bits to the top of the number and then
proceed&acirc; <br>
ing with the usual methods. The author finds this useful
with some analog-to-digital schemes that have several
low-order bits fixed at zero. For more, see Bit rotation
<br>
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --filename <br>
Save the original filename in the slim file header. By
default, slim does not include the filename in the slim
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S, --rawsize <br>
Save the original file&rsquo;s size (in bytes) in the slim
file header. (Currently, this is on by default and cannot be
turned off.) Note that when expanding, the raw file <br>
size is not tested against the size stored in the file
header.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C, --compute-crc32 <br>
On compression, compute a CRC-32 checksum on the raw data in
each section and include its value in the slim file. Default
is not to compute the CRC. (On expansion, slim <br>
will compute and test the checksum if it is present in the
slim file, with or without this option set. However, also
see --ignore-crc32 )</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Expansion options <br>
These options are ignored when compressing files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o, --stdout <br>
Write the results of expansion to stdout instead of to a
file or files. This option implies &quot;--preserve&quot;
and is equivalent to running slimcat</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-0, --ignore-crc32 <br>
On expansion, do not compute and test the CRC-32 checksum,
even if one is included in the slim file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Data description options <br>
The current version of slim requires that all data channels
be the same (i.e. of the same raw type, having the same
number of repeats per frame, and so forth). Therefore, when
<br>
given, all of the options in this section apply to all
channels. These requirements are not limitations inherent to
the slim file specification, but only to the current
imple&acirc; <br>
mentation of slim. In the future, it could be possible to
slim a more heterogeneous mix of data channels, if a
configuation file parser were to be added. For more on the
dif&acirc; <br>
ferences between the current restrictions on compression and
the full generality of the expander, see More general slim
data structures.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Data types are assumed to be 1-,
2- or 4-byte integers with little-endian byte order.
(Single-byte integer types cannot currently be specified at
the command line.) There are <br>
no immidiate plans to add facilities for handling 8-byte
integers or floating-point numbers to slim (although
command-line arguments have been reserved for the
floating-points).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See RAW DATA STRUCTURE for more
information about how the raw data is assumed to be
structured, and for the definitions of the terms channels,
sections, frames, and repeats.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All data description options
apply to compression only; they are all ignored when
expanding a slim file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --num-chan=nc <br>
The data consist of nc separate data channels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, --repeats=reps <br>
One frame contains reps consecutive repeated data values for
each channel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F, --frames=nf <br>
There are nf frames in each data section. Note that slim is
allowed to break up these frames into multiple sections as
needed to keep the section size below the hard <br>
limit of 16 MB, or for any other reason. However, slim will
also enforce a change to a new section at the end of every
nf frames with this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i, --int <br>
-u, --unsigned <br>
All data are signed or unsigned 32-bit integers (the default
is signed 32-bit).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --short <br>
-v, --ushort <br>
All data are signed or unsigned 16-bit integers. Some
aspects of slim are not implemented for short integers, such
as bit rotation. See BUGS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-y, --char <br>
All data are signed 8-bit integers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, --float <br>
-g, --double <br>
All data are 32-bit or 64-bit floating point numbers using
the IEEE-754 standard. Currently no floating-point
compression schemes are implemented, and this option is <br>
merely reserved for future use. Instead, 32-bit floating
point data are treated as signed 32-bit integers, while
64-bit data are stored without compression.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Data sampling options <br>
The main encoder system (the reduced binary method) works by
sampling only some fraction of the raw data and assuming
that the statistical properties of the sample are adequate
<br>
to predict the behavior of the entire set. The data sampling
options govern what fraction of the data are used in the
sampling. These control the tradeoff between speed and <br>
compression ratio.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Experience suggests that
sampling a greater fraction of the data offers very little
benefit; we suggest sampling no more than 10% of all values
(the default), unless you plan to <br>
do (or have done) a careful test of speed and compression
ratio.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the encoders are all
universal, in the sense that all possible values can be
encoded (though of course most values will not be compressed
to a smaller size). This <br>
means that the occasional unusual data value can be encoded,
and sparse sampling is not fatal to the resulting slim
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sampling can be done on a
maximum of 20,000 data values. All sample options refer to
percentages of either this maximum or the full number of
available values, whichever is <br>
smaller. Regardless of the options given, a minimum of 20
data values or all values will be sampled, whichever is
smaller.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-G, --sample-pct=pct <br>
Sample pct percent of the data (between 2 and 100%) up to a
maxmimum of 200*pct samples when determining the encoding
parameters. Default is 10% up to 2000 samples.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-9, --18-pct, --best <br>
Sample 18% of the data (up to 3600 samples) to determine
encoding parameters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-8, --16-pct <br>
Sample 16% of the data (up to 3200 samples) to determine
encoding parameters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-7, --14-pct <br>
Sample 14% of the data (up to 2800 samples) to determine
encoding parameters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-6, --12-pct <br>
Sample 12% of the data (up to 2400 samples) to determine
encoding parameters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-5, --10-pct <br>
Sample 10% of the data (up to 2000 samples) to determine
encoding parameters. (This is the default.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-4, --8-pct <br>
Sample 8% of the data (up to 1600 samples) to determine
encoding parameters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-3, --6-pct <br>
Sample 6% of the data (up to 1200 samples) to determine
encoding parameters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-2, --4-pct <br>
Sample 4% of the data (up to 800 samples) to determine
encoding parameters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-1, --2-pct, --fast <br>
Sample 2% of the data (up to 400 samples) to determine
encoding parameters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Debugging and unimplemented
features <br>
-B, --debug-buffer=bufsize <br>
read or write raw data from a debugging buffer of size
bufsize bytes. This is not the optimal way to compress or
expand files (though the price is small). This option is
<br>
only intended to exercise and debug parts of the code that
would be used in a planned slimlib library of functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RAW DATA STRUCTURE <br>
The fundamental concept in slimming a raw data file is that
of the data channel. One channel would normally correspond
to one physical data source, such a single thermometer or
<br>
encoder or other sensor. Good compression requres that the
distribution of the data from a single channel has a single
mode, that its statistical properties of be more or less
<br>
stationary,that the rate of extreme outliers be small (less
than a few percent), and so forth.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Data from more than one channel
can be mixed together in the raw file, provided that the
pattern of changes from one channel to another is repeated
consistently. The most gen&acirc; <br>
eral pattern permitted is to have M samples of channel 1,
followed by N samples of channel 2, and so forth until all
of the channels in the raw data file have appeared. This
<br>
unit of the raw file, with each channel occurring one time
and giving its expect number of samples, is called the
frame.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Multiple frames make up a
section. The raw data file is assumed to consist of one or
more sections concactenated together. The number, type,
repetition count, and order of the <br>
channels is fixed throughout a single section (and in the
current version of the slim executable, there is no way to
change these factors between sections, either). A section
<br>
consists of one or more frames, and it is valid for the last
section in a file to end with a fractional frame (this
would, we assume, be due to an unexpected event, such as a
raw <br>
data file being truncated during acquisition or
transmission).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a raw file contains only
one channel, there is an ambiguity in whether that channel
is being repeated N times within a single frame, or if it is
repeated only once in each <br>
of N frames. Because the first choice leads to faster
execution, slim silently selects it even if the user&rsquo;s
command-line options call for the second. Thus the options
&quot;--num- <br>
chan=1 --repeats=1 --frames=20000&quot; are silently
converted to &quot;--num-chan=1 --repeats=20000
--frames=1&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that if one or both of the
options giving the repeats or the frames are absent, then
slim tries to do the smartest possible thing. You probably
don&rsquo;t want to let it do <br>
that, but you can.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">More general slim data
structures <br>
The slim executable produces slim files with several
restrictions that are not inherent to the definition of the
slim file format itself. The expander can expand files
meeting <br>
the more general specification, but there is no way at this
time to construct these more general files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here we list some ways that the
structure could be less restrictive than the current
compression executable permits. For one thing, the data type
of different channels need not <br>
be the same, and the number of repeats can also be
different. The list of channels could change between one
section and the next. Also, the slim file specification
allows all <br>
sections--not only the last--to be of arbitrary size.
However, the current implementation of the slim executable
does not offer a way to break up the raw data into sections
at <br>
arbitrary places in the raw file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Currently, slim enforces a limit
that sections be no longer than 16 MB (2^24 bytes), because
of the implementation detail that sections must be held in
memory when compressing or <br>
expanding them. If data comprising what is conceptually one
section exceed this limit, then slim silently divides it
into two or more sections of nearly equal length and writes
<br>
them one after another. This fact is not generally relevant
to the user, but it does mean that compression will not be
very effective if there are channels that repeat only a <br>
few times per 16 MB of raw data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENCODING ALGORITHMS <br>
slim uses a few different algorithms for converting raw data
into generally smaller data. By &quot;generally&quot;, we
mean that no system can convert all possible 32-bit values
into <br>
smaller ones; this is shown by a simple counting argument.
The goal of slim is to recognize a small subset of values
that appear most often and to map only this subset into <br>
codes that require fewer bits. All other data values outside
the small subset are expanded into more than their original
number of bits. If most or all raw values come from the <br>
compressible subset, then the encoded data will be smaller
than the raw data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that all encoding methods
currently used in slim convert a single value into an exact
integer number of bits (unlike range or arithmetic coding).
Thus each bit in a slim <br>
file is a part of (or all of) the code for a single value in
the raw file (unless, of course, it belongs to the
file&rsquo;s header data).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The three encoding methods
currently implemented are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Constant-value encoding <br>
A channel that contains exactly the same value for every
instance will be encoded as a constant-value. This system
compresses each value to zero bits, apart from record&acirc;
<br>
ing the constant value in the section header. No
command-line option is required for constant-value encoding:
all channels will be checked to see if their values are <br>
strictly constant, and if so, they will be encoded by this
method in preference over all others.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Run-length encoding <br>
For a channel whose values are strictly constant for long
runs but not for an entire data section, run-length encoding
is ideal. For example, it works well on a channel <br>
storing the integer part of the time (in seconds), if the
time is sampled many times per second. This method will
store a repeated run of a single value as a (value, <br>
count) pair.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Two cautions are: (1) if the
data sample used for evaluation shows that run-length
encoding will not actually compress the data channel, then
that channel will silently <br>
switch over to the standard reduced-binary encoding, and (2)
the longest possible run is the number of repetitions within
a frame--for technical reasons, a &quot;run&quot; cannot
<br>
cross from one frame to another. If a channel&rsquo;s values
do not appear as several successive words in the raw file,
then run-length encoding is not a good choice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Reduced-binary encoding <br>
This is the default method. The reduced-binary encoder has
two parameters: the number of bits N used for storing the
&quot;normal&quot; data, and the offset s subtracted from
each <br>
value before encoding. The idea is to choose the parameters
so that most or all values lie in the range [ s, s+(2^N)-2 ]
and can therefore be stored using only N bits. <br>
The value s+(2^N)-1 is reserved to indicate
&quot;Overflow&quot;, that the value being encoded did not
lie in the normal range. Overflow codes are followed by the
raw data value <br>
itself, stored in its natural length of 32 or 16 bits. Thus,
most 32-bit data are stored as N-bit numbers, while a small
fraction require N+32 bits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The parameters are chosen using
the data sample set. All possible values are tested for N,
while s is varied to keep the arithmetic mean of the sample
data in the middle <br>
of the normal range for the given value of N. The choice of
N is that which gives the best compression on the sample
data set. Note that keeping the mean in the middle <br>
of the range might not always be appropriate for every
possible distribution, but that&rsquo;s how it is done.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tested but rejected encoding
algorithms <br>
Three other algorithms were implemented into slim and later
removed. Each of them improves on the compression ratios of
the reduced-binary code, but the improvements are small <br>
and come at a price in compression and expansion speed (not
to mention program complexity). Development on these
algorithms was dropped for this reason, and we mention them
in <br>
case you are also pondering ideas for improved encoding
algorithms in slim.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Codes A and B <br>
Codes A and B are minor variations on the reduced-binary
code. The former changes how the presence of overflows is
signaled, and the latter also changes how their over&acirc;
<br>
flowing values are stored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Code A arises from the
observation that overflow values might be rare, but they are
still more common than any other single value. The idea is
to encode most normal val&acirc; <br>
ues as an N-bit number but the overflow as an m-bit number,
where m&lt;N. The result is to make each overflow take up
(N-m) fewer bits, while the allowed range of values <br>
contains only 2^(N)-2^(N-m) values, slightly fewer than it
would have had otherwise. This results in savings of
approximately 0.15 to 0.20 bits per channel for normally-
<br>
distributed data. However, the method was removed from slim
because of its CPU cost: decoding each normal value requires
first reading m bits, testing whether they are <br>
the overflow code, and (if not) then reading in an
additional (N-m) bits to find the full N-bit number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Code B expands on Code A. It
starts with the observation that overflow values are not
generally taken randomly from the full range of possible
values, but instead are <br>
most likely found near the allowed range of non-overflowing
values. It is therefore beneficial to write the overflowed
value not as a full 32-bit number (assuming the raw <br>
data are 32-bit numbers), but instead as an N-bit, or
(N+1)-bit number. Thus, overflows are encoded as in Code A,
followed by a (prefix, value), where the prefix is an <br>
exponential Golomb code for the value&rsquo;s size
(actually, the size with N subtracted, since the size of an
overflowing value is guaranteed to be no less than N). As
with <br>
Code A, it improves compression by some fraction of one bit
per value, but the savings were judged not to be worth the
performance penalty.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Huffman coding <br>
Huffman coding of the raw data clearly accomplished the best
compression ratios of all methods. However, it was also the
slowest and so was removed from the program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The approach is to take the data
and split it into &quot;upper&quot; and &quot;lower&quot;
bits. The upper bits are Huffman-coded, while the lower bits
are assumed to be uniformly-distrib&acirc; <br>
uted random values and are repeated verbatim into the
compressed data stream. The split into upper and lower is
made such that the data sample contains no more than 127
<br>
distinct values for the upper bits. The Huffman tree is
built on the sampled frequencies of the values of the upper
bits (with an extra symbol to signal overflows). The <br>
choice of 127 symbols was motivated by the possibility of
storing the code tree with N symbols in only (N+1) bytes,
and by the observation that even as few as 32 symbols <br>
work just as well on truly Gaussian-distributed data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The price of decoding
Huffman-encoded symbols is steep: we found that decoding
took twice as long when the Huffman encoders were used. The
problem is that the prefix-free <br>
Huffman codes must be read one bit at a time, for there is
no way to know their length in advance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bit rotation <br>
Bit-rotation is an advanced feature that helps in
compressing channels where the lowest B bits are constant.
This sort of channel violates the usual assumption that data
follow <br>
a smooth distribution function, and that the lowest few bits
are likely to be distributed almost uniformly. The author of
slim has certainly found channels in real experiments <br>
where (for example) the six least significant bits are
always zero. This might happen a case where an IEEE 754
floating-point number with 24 bits in its sign-plus-mantissa
was <br>
converted to and recorded as an integer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If such a channel were encoded
by the reduced-binary encoder, then the unchanging B lowest
bits would be faithfully but wastefully reproduced over and
over again. Bit rotation <br>
offers a way around this redundancy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bit rotation has slim encode
such a channel by bit-shifting the raw value by B bits to
the right and then copying what were the B lowest bits to
the top (most significant bits) <br>
of the shifted result. This makes, for example, the value
0xbeef9900 into 0x00beef99 for the case of B=8. The reduced
binary encoder can then act on the bit-rotated result, in
<br>
which the lowest bits of the new value are presumably less
repetetive than they were before bit rotation was
applied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The user selects only whether to
try bit rotation with the --permit-bitrotation option. The
program then decides whether to choose a non-zero value of B
based on the sampled <br>
data set. The choice will be the number of lowest-order bits
that are strictly constant throughout the sample set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The penalty for trying bit
rotation on every channel is modest when
compressing--causing roughly a 1.5% increase in instructions

penalty in expanding unless bit rotation was actually
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">32- VERSUS 64-BIT ARCHITECTURES
AND ENDIANNESS <br>
In order to operate on machines with 32-bit and 64-bit
processors, slim uses strictly sized data types where it
matters, such as int32_t for signed 32-bit integers. There
are no <br>
known problems in running it on machines with 32-bit or
64-bit word sizes. The low-level bit operations are
performed on words with the same size as the C++ data type
long which <br>
would normally be the native word size of the build machine.
The code works either way, but it is likely most efficient
to operate on words of the native size. The author <br>
admits to not having verified this hunch empirically. (You
can override this choice and force 32 or 64 bit word sizes.
You do this when running build_bit_constants during the <br>
build process, but you probably don&rsquo;t want to unless
cross-compiling.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Because of the author&rsquo;s
prejudice or narrow experience (or the demands of his day
job), the assumption that words are in little-endian order
is deeply embedded in slim. An ambi&acirc; <br>
tious future contributor is welcome to remove this
restriction, but it is hard to see how to handle
byte-swapping without a performance penalty. For now, slim
fails an assertion <br>
if run on a big-endian machine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
It would be very reasonable to have slim use environment
variables for some things. Feel free to suggest such
features; there are none at this time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
First, compress data from a Multi-channel electronics
system. The raw files consist of frames 4400 bytes long
having 1100 4-byte words. We ignore that a few of the
channels are <br>
unsigned and treat them all as signed words. Each channel
repeats only once in the frame. We want to encode the
differences between successive data values and use method 2
(the <br>
reduced binary encoder).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">slim -c1100 -i -r1 -dm2
raw_mce_file.dat</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Next, a file containing only
many, many repetitions of a single channel:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">slim -c1 -i -dm2
one_channel_only.dat</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To uncompress both files:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unslim raw_mce_file.dat.slm
one_channel_only.dat.slm</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS AND UNIMPLEMENTED FEATURES
<br>
The -f and -g command-line options for floating-point data
are reserved but aren&rsquo;t implemented.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bit rotation does not work when
the data are 8 or 16-bit integers (whether signed or
unsigned).</p>
