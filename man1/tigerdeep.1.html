<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
md5deep -v | -V | -h <br>
md5deep [-m|-M|-x|-X &lt;file&gt;] [-a|-A &lt;hash&gt;] [-f
&lt;file&gt;] [-p &lt;size&gt;] [-i &lt;size&gt;]
[-tnwzresS0lbkqZud] [-F &lt;bum&gt;] [-o &lt;fbcplsde&gt;]
[-j &lt;num&gt;] [[FILES]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Computes the hashes, or message digest, for any number of
files while optionally recursively digging through the
directory structure. Can also take a list of known hashes
and <br>
display the filenames of input files whose hashes either do
or do not match any of the known hashes. Errors are reported
to standard error. If no FILES are specified, reads from
<br>
standard input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p &lt;size&gt; <br>
Piecewise mode. Breaks files into chunks before hashing.
Chunks may be specified using IEC multipliers b, k, m, g, t,
p, or e. (Never let it be said that the author <br>
didn&rsquo;t plan ahead!) This mode cannot be used with the
-z mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i|-I &lt;size&gt; <br>
Size threshold mode. Only hash files smaller than the given
the threshold. In -i mode, simply omits those files larger
than the threshold. In -I mode, displays all files, <br>
but uses asterisks for the hashes of files larger than the
threshold. Sizes may be specified using IEC multipliers b,
k, m, g, t, p, or e.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Enables recursive mode. All
subdirectories are traversed. Please note that recursive
mode cannot be used to examine all files of a given file
extension. For example, call&acirc; <br>
ing md5deep -r *.txt will examine all files in directories
that end in .txt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e Displays a progress indicator
and estimate of time remaining for each file being
processed. Time estimates for files larger than 4GB are not
available on Windows. This <br>
mode may not be used with th -p mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m &lt;file&gt; <br>
Enables matching mode. The file given should be a list of
known hashes. The input files are examined one at a time,
and only those files that match the list of known <br>
hashes are output. This flag may be used more than once to
add multiple sets of known hashes. Acceptable formats for
lists of known hashes are plain (such as those gener&acirc;
<br>
ated by md5deep or md5sum), Hashkeeper files, iLook, and the
National Software Reference Library (NSRL) as produced by
the National Institute for Standards in Technology. <br>
If standard input is used with the -m flag, displays
&quot;stdin&quot; if the input matches one of the hashes in
the list of known hashes. If the hash does not match, the
program <br>
displays no output. <br>
This flag may not be used in conjunction with the -x, -X, or
-A flags. See the section &quot;UNICODE SUPPORT&quot;
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x &lt;file&gt; <br>
Same as the -m flag above, but does negative matching. That
is, only those files NOT in the list of known hashes are
displayed. <br>
This flag may not be used in conjunction with the -m, -M, or
-a flags. See the section &quot;UNICODE SUPPORT&quot;
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M and -X &lt;file&gt; <br>
Same as -m and -x above, but displays the hash for each file
that does (or does not) match the list of known hashes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a &lt;hash&gt; <br>
Adds a single hash to the list of known hashes used for
matching mode, and if not already enabled, enables matching
mode. Adding single hashes cannot, by itself, be used <br>
to print the hashes of matching files like the -M flag does.
When used in conjunction with the -w flag, the filename
displayed is just the hash submitted on the command <br>
line. <br>
This flag may not be used in conjunction with the -x, -X, or
-A flags.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A &lt;hash&gt; <br>
Same as -a above, but does negative matching. This flag may
not be used in conjunction with the -m, -M, or -A flags.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f &lt;file&gt; <br>
Takes a list of files to be hashed from the specified file.
Each line is assumed to be a filename. This flag can only be
used once per invocation. If it&rsquo;s used a second <br>
time, the second instance will clobber the first. <br>
Note that you can still use other flags, such as the -m or
-x modes, and submit additional FILES on the command
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w During any of the matching
modes (-m,-M,-x,or -X), displays the filename of the known
hash that matched the input file. See the section
&quot;UNICODE SUPPORT&quot; below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Display a timestamp in GMT
with each result. On Windows this timestamp will be the
file&rsquo;s creation time. On all other systems it should
be the file&rsquo;s change time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n During any of the matching
modes (-m,-M,-x,or -X), displays only the filenames of any
known hashes that were not matched by any of the input
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Enables silent mode. All
error messages are supressed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S Like silent mode, but still
displays warnings on improperly formatted hashes in the list
of known hashes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z Enables file size mode.
Prepends the hash with a ten digit representation of the
size of each file processed. If the file size is greater
than 9999999999 bytes (about <br>
9.3GB) the program displays 9999999999 for the size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Quiet mode. File names are
omitted from the output. Each hash is still followed by two
spaces before the newline.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Z Produces output in Triage
format. Each line contans the file&rsquo;s size, a tab, a
hash of the first 512 bytes, a tab, the hash of the complete
file, a tab, and the file name. <br>
These values are intended in increasing order of
specificity. That is, two files with different sizes cannot
possibly match. This is a fast comparison and should be done
<br>
first. Next, two files with different partial hashes cannot
possibly match. This is often faster than hashing the whole
file. Finally, if those two pieces align, then it&rsquo;s
<br>
worth reading and hashing the entire file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-0 Uses a NULL character (/0) to
terminate each line instead of a newline. Useful for
processing filenames with strange characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l Enables relative file paths.
Instead of printing the absolute path for each file,
displays the relative file path as indicated on the command
line. This flag may not be <br>
used in conjunction with the -b flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b Enables bare mode. Strips any
leading directory information from displayed filenames. This
flag may not be used in conjunction with the -l flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k Enables asterisk mode. An
asterisk is inserted in lieu of a second space between the
filename and the hash, just like md5sum in its binary (-b)
mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Enables comma separated
values output, or CSV mode. This mode has the side effect of
removing the 10 digit size limitation from -z mode. Also
note that asterisks from -k <br>
mode are not displayed when in CSV mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o &lt;bcpflsd&gt; <br>
Enables expert mode. Allows the user specify which (and only
which) types of files are processed. Directory processing is
still controlled with the -r flag. The expert <br>
mode options allowed are: <br>
f - Regular files <br>
b - Block Devices <br>
c - Character Devices <br>
p - Named Pipes <br>
l - Symbolic Links <br>
s - Sockets <br>
d - Solaris Doors <br>
e - Windows PE executables</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-jnn Controls multi-threading.
By default the program will create one producer thread to
scan the file system and one hashing thread per CPU core.
Multi-threading causes output <br>
filenames to be in non-deterministic order, as files that
take longer to hash will be delayed while they are hashed.
If a deterministic order is required, specify -j0 to <br>
disable multi-threading</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Output in Digital Forensics
XML (DFXML) format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u Quote Unicode output. For
example, the snowman is shown as U+C426.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F&lt;bum&gt; <br>
Specifies the input mode that is used to read files. The
default is -Fb (buffered I/O) which reads files with
fopen(). Specifying -Fu will use unbuffered I/O and read the
<br>
file with open(). Specifying -Fm will use memory-mapped I/O
which will be faster on some platforms, but which
(currently) will not work with files that produce I/O
errors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Show a help screen and
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Show the version number and
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Show copyright information
and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UNICODE SUPPORT <br>
As of version 3.0 the program supports Unicode characters in
filenames on Microsoft Windows systems for filenames
specified on the command line with globbing (e.g. *), for
files <br>
specified with the -f of files to hash, and for files read
from directories using the -r option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default all program input and
output should be in UTF-8. The program automatically
converts this to UTF-16 for opening files).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On Unix/Linux/MacOS, you should
use a terminal emulator that supports UTF-8 and UTF-8
characters in filenames will be properly displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On Windows, the programs do not
display Unicode characters on the console. You must either
redirect output to a file and open the file with Wordpad
(which can display Unicode), <br>
or you must specify the -u option to quote Unicode using
standard U+XXXX notation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Currently the file name of a
file containing known hashes may not be specified as a
unicode filename, but you can specify the name using tab
completition or an asterisk (e.g. <br>
md5deep -m *.txt where there is only one file with a .txt
extension).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RETURN VALUE <br>
Returns a bit-wise value based on the success of the
operation and the status of any matching operations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 Success. Note that the program
considers itself successful even when it encounters read
errors, permission denied errors, or finds directories when
not in recursive mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 Unused hashes. Under any of
the matching modes, returns this value if one or more of the
known hashes was not matched by any of the input files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 Unmatched inputs. Under any of
the matching modes, returns this value if one or more of the
input values did not match any of the known hashes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">64 User error, such as trying to
do both positive and negative matching at the same time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">128 Internal error, such as
memory corruption or uncaught cycle. All internal errors
should be reported to the developer! See the section
&quot;Reporting Bugs&quot; below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KNOWN ISSUES <br>
Using the -r flag cannot be used to recursively process all
files of a given extension in a directory. This is a
feature, not a bug. If you need to do this, use the find(1)
com&acirc; <br>
mand.</p>
