<i>qstat</i> shows the current status of the available Sun Grid Engine queues
  and the jobs associated with the queues. Selection options allow you to get
  information about specific jobs, queues or users. If multiple selections are
  done a queue is only displayed if all selection criteria for a queue instance
  are met. Without any option <i>qstat</i> will display only a list of jobs with
  no queue status information.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The administrator and the user may define files (see which can contain any of
  the options described below. A cluster-wide sge_qstat file may be placed under
  $SGE_ROOT/$SGE_CELL/common/sge_qstat The user private file is searched at the
  location $HOME/.sge_qstat. The home directory request file has the highest
  precedence over the cluster global file. Command line can be used to override
  the flags contained in the files.

As opposed to this, the state A(larm) indicates that at least one of the suspend

  running in that queue being successively suspended until no threshold is
  violated.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The states s(uspended) and d(isabled) can be assigned to queues and released via
  the command. Suspending a queue will cause all jobs executing in that queue to
  be suspended.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The states D(isabled) and C(alendar suspended) indicate that the queue has been
  disabled or suspended automatically via the calendar facility of Sun Grid
  Engine (see while the S(ubordinate) state indicates, that the queue has been
  suspend via subordination to another queue (see for details). When suspending
  a queue (regardless of the cause) all jobs executing in that queue are

If the c(onfiguration ambiguous) state is displayed for a queue instance this
  indicates that the configuration specified for this queue instance in is
  ambiguous. This state is cleared when the configuration becomes unambiguous
  again. This state prevents further jobs from being scheduled to that queue
  instance. Detailed reasons why a queue instance entered the c(onfiguration
  ambiguous) state can be found in the messages file and are shown by the qstat
  -explain switch. For queue instances in this state the cluster queue's default
  settings are used for the ambiguous attribute.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If an o(rphaned) state is displayed for a queue instance, it indicates that the
  queue instance is no longer demanded by the current cluster queue's
  configuration or the host group configuration. The queue instance is kept
  because jobs which not yet finished jobs are still associated with it, and it
  will vanish from qstat output when these jobs have finished. To quicken
  vanishing of an orphaned queue instance associated job(s) can be deleted using
  A queue instance in (o)rphaned state can be revived by changing the cluster
  queue configuration accordingly to cover that queue instance. This state
  prevents from scheduling further jobs to that queue instance.

If the <b>-F</b> option was used, resource availability information is printed
  following the queue status line. For each resource (as selected in an option
  argument to <b>-F</b> or for all resources if the option argument was omitted)
  a single line is displayed with the following format:
<dl class="Bl-tag">

      value.</dd>

<div class="Pp"></div>
The displayed availability values and the sources from which they derive are
  always the minimum values of all possible combinations. Hence, for example, a
  line of the form &quot;qf:h_vmem=4G&quot; indicates that a queue currently has
  a maximum availability in virtual memory of 4 Gigabyte, where this value is a
  fixed value (e.g. a resource limit in the queue configuration) and it is queue
  dominated, i.e. the host in total may have more virtual memory available than
  this, but the queue doesn't allow for more. Contrarily a line
  &quot;hl:h_vmem=4G&quot; would also indicate an upper bound of 4 Gigabyte
  virtual memory availability, but the limit would be derived from a load value
  currently reported for the host. So while the queue might allow for jobs with
  higher virtual memory requirements, the host on which this particular queue
  resides currently only has 4 Gigabyte available.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the <b>-explain</b> option was used with the character 'a' or 'A',
  information about resources is displayed, that violate load or suspend
  thresholds.

Following the list of queue sections a <i>PENDING JOBS</i> list may be printed
  in case jobs are waiting for being assigned to a queue. A status line for each
  waiting job is displayed being similar to the one for the running jobs. The

  submit time and date is shown instead of the start time and that no function
  is displayed for the jobs.

In very rare cases, e.g. if starts up from an inconsistent state in the job or
  queue spool files or if the <b>clean queue</b> (<b>-cq</b>) option of is used,
  <i>qstat</i> cannot assign jobs to either the running or pending jobs section
  of the output. In this case as job status inconsistency (e.g. a job has a
  running status but is not assigned to a queue) has been detected. Such jobs
  are printed in an <i>ERROR JOBS</i> section at the very end of the output. The
