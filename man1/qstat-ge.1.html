<p>QSTAT(1) Sun Grid Engine User Commands QSTAT(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
qstat - show the status of Sun Grid Engine jobs and
queues</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNTAX <br>
qstat [ -ext ] [ -cb ] [ -f ] [ -F [resource_name,...] ] [
-g {c|d|t}[+] ] [ -help ] [ -j [job_list] ] [ -l
resource=val,... ] [ -ne ] [ -pe pe_name,... ] [ -pri ] [ -q

[ -u user,... ] [ -urg ] [ -xml ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
qstat shows the current status of the available Sun Grid
Engine queues and the jobs associated with the queues.
Selection options allow you to get information about
specific <br>
jobs, queues or users. If multiple selections are done a
queue is only displayed if all selection criteria for a
queue instance are met. Without any option qstat will
display <br>
only a list of jobs with no queue status information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The administrator and the user
may define files (see sge_qstat(5)), which can contain any
of the options described below. A cluster-wide sge_qstat
file may be placed under <br>
$SGE_ROOT/$SGE_CELL/common/sge_qstat The user private file
is searched at the location $HOME/.sge_qstat. The home
directory request file has the highest precedence over the
<br>
cluster global file. Command line can be used to override
the flags contained in the files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-cb In combination with -cb the output of this command will
additionally contain the information of a requested binding
and the changes that have been applied to the topology <br>
string (real binding) for the host where this job is
running. This additional information will appear in
combination with the parameters -r and -j.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please note that this command
line switch will be removed with the next major release.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-explain a|A|c|E <br>
&Acirc;&acute;c&rsquo; displays the reason for the
c(onfiguration ambiguous) state of a queue instance.
&rsquo;a&rsquo; shows the reason for the alarm state.
Suspend alarm state reasons will be dis&acirc; <br>
played by &rsquo;A&rsquo;. &rsquo;E&rsquo; displays the
reason for a queue instance error state.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The output format for the alarm
reasons is one line per reason containing the resource value
and threshold. For details about the resource value please
refer to the <br>
description of the Full Format in section OUTPUT FORMATS
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ext Displays additional
information for each job related to the job ticket policy
scheme (see OUTPUT FORMATS below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Specifies a &quot;full&quot;
format display of information. The -f option causes summary
information on all queues to be displayed along with the
queued job list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F [ resource_name,... ] <br>
Like in the case of -f information is displayed on all jobs
as well as queues. In addition, qstat will present a
detailed listing of the current resource availability per
<br>
queue with respect to all resources (if the option argument
is omitted) or with respect to those resources contained in
the resource_name list. Please refer to the <br>
description of the Full Format in section OUTPUT FORMATS
below for further detail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g {c|d|t}[+] <br>
The -g option allows for controlling grouping of displayed
objects.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With -g c a cluster queue
summary is displayed. Find more information in the section
OUTPUT FORMATS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With -g d array jobs are
displayed verbosely in a one line per job task fashion. By
default, array jobs are grouped and all tasks with the same
status (for pending tasks <br>
only) are displayed in a single line. The array job task id
range field in the output (see section OUTPUT FORMATS)
specifies the corresponding set of tasks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With -g t parallel jobs are
displayed verbosely in a one line per parallel job task
fashion. By default, parallel job tasks are displayed in a
single line. Also with -g t <br>
option the function of each parallel task is displayed
rather than the jobs slot amount (see section OUTPUT
FORMATS).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-help Prints a listing of all
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-j [job_list] <br>
Prints either for all pending jobs or the jobs contained in
job_list various information. The job_list can contain
job_ids, job_names, or wildcard expression sge_types(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For jobs in E(rror) state the
error reason is displayed. For jobs that could not be
dispatched during in the last scheduling interval the
obstacles are shown, if <br>
&rsquo;schedd_job_info&rsquo; in sched_conf(5) is configured
accordingly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For running jobs available
information on resource utilization is shown about consumed
cpu time in seconds, integral memory usage in Gbytes
seconds, amount of data trans&acirc; <br>
ferred in io operations, current virtual memory utilization
in Mbytes, and maximum virtual memory utilization in Mbytes.
This information is not available if resource uti&acirc;
<br>
lization retrieval is not supported for the OS platform
where the job is hosted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In combination with -cp the
output of this command will additionally contain the
information of a requested binding (see -binding of qsub(1))
and the changes that have <br>
been applied to the topology string (real binding) for the
host where this job is running.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The topology string will contain
capital letters for all those cores that were not bound to
the displayed job. Bound cores will be shown lowercase (E.g
&quot;SCCcCSCCcC&quot; means <br>
that core 2 on the two available sockets where bound to this
job).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please refer to the file
&lt;sge_root&gt;/doc/load_parameters.asc for detailed
information on the standard set of load values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l resource[=value],... <br>
Defines the resources required by the jobs or granted by the
queues on which information is requested. Matching is
performed on queues based on non-mutable resource
avail&acirc; <br>
ability information only. That means load values are always
ignored except the so-called static load values (i.e.
&quot;arch&quot;, &quot;num_proc&quot;,
&quot;mem_total&quot;, &quot;swap_total&quot; and
&quot;vir&acirc; <br>
tual_total&quot;). Consumable utilization is also ignored.
The pending jobs are restricted to jobs that might run in
one of the above queues. In a similar fashion also the <br>
queue-job matching bases only on non-mutable resource
availability information. If there are multiple -l resource
requests they will be concatenated by a logical AND: a <br>
queue needs to match all resources to be displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ne In combination with -f the
option suppresses the display of empty queues. This means
all queues where actually no jobs are running are not
displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pe pe_name,... <br>
Displays status information with respect to queues which are
attached to at least one of the parallel environments
enlisted in the comma separated option argument. Status <br>
information for jobs is displayed either for those which
execute in one of the selected queues or which are pending
and might get scheduled to those queues in principle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pri Displays additional
information for each job related to the job priorities in
general. (see OUTPUT FORMATS below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q wc_queue_list <br>
Specifies a wildcard expression queue list to which job
information is to be displayed. Find the definition of
wc_queue_list in sge_types(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-qs {a|c|d|o|s|u|A|C|D|E|S} <br>
Allows for the filtering of queue instances according to
state.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Prints extended information
about the resource requirements of the displayed jobs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In combination with -cb the
output of this command will contain additional information
concerning the requested binding for a job. (see -binding of
qsub(1)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please refer to the OUTPUT
FORMATS sub-section Expanded Format below for detailed
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s
{p|r|s|z|hu|ho|hs|hd|hj|ha|h|a}[+]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Prints only jobs in the
specified state, any combination of states is possible. -s
prs corresponds to the regular qstat output without -s at
all. To show recently finished <br>
jobs, use -s z. To display jobs in
user/operator/system/array-dependency hold, use the -s
hu/ho/hs/hd option. The -s ha option shows jobs which where
submitted with the <br>
qsub -a command. qstat -s hj displays all jobs which are not
eligible for execution unless the job has entries in the job
dependency list. qstat -s h is an abbreviation <br>
for qstat -s huhohshdhjha and qstat -s a is an abbreviation
for qstat -s psr (see -a, -hold_jid and -hold_jid_ad options
to qsub(1)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Prints extended information
about the controlled sub-tasks of the displayed parallel
jobs. Please refer to the OUTPUT FORMATS sub-section Reduced
Format below for detailed <br>
information. Sub-tasks of parallel jobs should not be
confused with array job tasks (see -g option above and -t
option to qsub(1)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U user,... <br>
Displays status information with respect to queues to which
the specified users have access. Status information for jobs
is displayed either for those which execute in one <br>
of the selected queues or which are pending and might get
scheduled to those queues in principle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u user,... <br>
Display information only on those jobs and queues being
associated with the users from the given user list. Queue
status information is displayed if the -f or -F options <br>
are specified additionally and if the user runs jobs in
those queues.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The string $user is a
placeholder for the current username. An asterisk
&quot;*&quot; can be used as username wildcard to request
any users&rsquo; jobs be displayed. The default value <br>
for this switch is -u $user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-urg Displays additional
information for each job related to the job urgency policy
scheme (see OUTPUT FORMATS below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-xml This option can be used
with all other options and changes the output to XML. The
used schemas are referenced in the XML output. The output is
printed to stdout. For more <br>
detailed information, the schemas for the qstat command can
be found in $SGE_ROOT/util/resources/schemas/qstat.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -xml parameter is
combined with -cb then the XML output will contain
additional tags containing information about job to core
binding. You can also find schema <br>
files with the suffix &quot;_cb&quot; in the directory
$SGE_ROOT/util/resources/schemas/qstat that describe that
changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT FORMATS <br>
Depending on the presence or absence of the -explain, -f,
-F, or -qs and -r and -t option three output formats need to
be differentiated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -ext and -urg options may be
used to display additional information for each job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cluster Queue Format (with -g c)
<br>
Following the header line a section for each cluster queue
is provided. When queue instances selection are applied (-l
-pe, -q, -U) the cluster format contains only cluster <br>
queues of the corresponding queue instances.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; the cluster
queue name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; an average of
the normalized load average of all queue hosts. In order to
reflect each hosts different significance the number of
configured slots is used as a weighting fac&acirc; <br>
tor when determining cluster queue load. Please note that
only hosts with a np_load_value are considered for this
value. When queue selection is applied only data about <br>
selected queues is considered in this formula. If the load
value is not available at any of the hosts
&rsquo;-NA-&rsquo; is printed instead of the value from the
complex attribute defini&acirc; <br>
tion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; the number of
currently used slots.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; the number of
slots reserved in advance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; the number of
currently available slots.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; the total number
of slots.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; the number of
slots which is in at least one of the states
&rsquo;aoACDS&rsquo; and in none of the states
&rsquo;cdsuE&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; the number of
slots which are in one of these states or in any combination
of them: &rsquo;cdsuE&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; the -g c option
can be used in combination with -ext. In this case,
additional columns are added to the output. Each column
contains the slot count for one of the available <br>
queue states.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Reduced Format (without -f, -F,
and -qs) <br>
Following the header line a line is printed for each job
consisting of</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; the job ID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; the priority of
the job determining its position in the pending jobs list.
The priority value is determined dynamically based on ticket
and urgency policy set-up (see also <br>
sge_priority(5) ).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; the name of the
job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; the user name of
the job owner.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; the status of
the job - one of d(eletion), E(rror), h(old), r(unning),
R(estarted), s(uspended), S(uspended), t(ransfering),
T(hreshold) or w(aiting).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The state d(eletion) indicates
that a qdel(1) has been used to initiate job deletion. The
states t(ransfering) and r(unning) indicate that a job is
about to be executed or is <br>
already executing, whereas the states s(uspended),
S(uspended) and T(hreshold) show that an already running
jobs has been suspended. The s(uspended) state is caused by
sus&acirc; <br>
pending the job via the qmod(1) command, the S(uspended)
state indicates that the queue containing the job is
suspended and therefore the job is also suspended and the
<br>
T(hreshold) state shows that at least one suspend threshold
of the corresponding queue was exceeded (see queue_conf(5))
and that the job has been suspended as a consequence. <br>
The state R(estarted) indicates that the job was restarted.
This can be caused by a job migration or because of one of
the reasons described in the -r section of the qsub(1) <br>
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The states w(aiting) and h(old)
only appear for pending jobs. The h(old) state indicates
that a job currently is not eligible for execution due to a
hold state assigned to it <br>
via qhold(1), qalter(1) or the qsub(1) -h option or that the
job is waiting for completion of the jobs to which job
dependencies have been assigned to the job via the <br>
-hold_jid or -hold_jid-ad options of qsub(1) or
qalter(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The state E(rror) appears for
pending jobs that couldn&rsquo;t be started due to job
properties. The reason for the job error is shown by the
qstat(1) -j job_list option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; the submission
or start time and date of the job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; the queue the
job is assigned to (for running or suspended jobs only).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; the number of
job slots or the function of parallel job tasks if -g t is
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Without -g t option the total
number of slots occupied resp. requested by the job is
displayed. For pending parallel jobs with a PE slot range
request, the assumed future slot <br>
allocation is displayed. With -g t option the function of
the running jobs (MASTER or SLAVE - the latter for parallel
jobs only) is displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; the array job
task id. Will be empty for non-array jobs. See the -t option
to qsub(1) and the -g above for additional information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -t option is supplied,
each status line always contains parallel job task
information as if -g t were specified and each line contains
the following parallel job subtask <br>
information:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; the parallel
task ID (do not confuse parallel tasks with array job
tasks),</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; the status of
the parallel task - one of r(unning), R(estarted),
s(uspended), S(uspended), T(hreshold), w(aiting), h(old), or
x(exited).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; the cpu, memory,
and I/O usage,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; the exit status
of the parallel task,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; and the failure
code and message for the parallel task.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Full Format (with -f and -F)
<br>
Following the header line a section for each queue separated
by a horizontal line is provided. For each queue the
information printed consists of</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; the queue
name,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; the queue type -
one of B(atch), I(nteractive), C(heckpointing), P(arallel),
T(ransfer) or combinations thereof or N(one),</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; the number of
used and available job slots,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; the load average
of the queue host,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; the architecture
of the queue host and</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; the state of the
queue - one of u(nknown) if the corresponding sge_execd(8)
cannot be contacted, a(larm), A(larm), C(alendar suspended),
s(uspended), S(ubordinate), <br>
d(isabled), D(isabled), E(rror) or combinations thereof.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the state is a(larm) at least
on of the load thresholds defined in the load_thresholds
list of the queue configuration (see queue_conf(5)) is
currently exceeded, which pre&acirc; <br>
vents from scheduling further jobs to that queue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As opposed to this, the state
A(larm) indicates that at least one of the suspend
thresholds of the queue (see queue_conf(5)) is currently
exceeded. This will result in jobs run&acirc; <br>
ning in that queue being successively suspended until no
threshold is violated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The states s(uspended) and
d(isabled) can be assigned to queues and released via the
qmod(1) command. Suspending a queue will cause all jobs
executing in that queue to be sus&acirc; <br>
pended.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The states D(isabled) and
C(alendar suspended) indicate that the queue has been
disabled or suspended automatically via the calendar
facility of Sun Grid Engine (see calen&acirc; <br>
dar_conf(5)), while the S(ubordinate) state indicates, that
the queue has been suspend via subordination to another
queue (see queue_conf(5) for details). When suspending a
queue <br>
(regardless of the cause) all jobs executing in that queue
are suspended too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If an E(rror) state is displayed
for a queue, sge_execd(8) on that host was unable to locate
the sge_shepherd(8) executable on that host in order to
start a job. Please check the <br>
error logfile of that sge_execd(8) for leads on how to
resolve the problem. Please enable the queue afterwards via
the -c option of the qmod(1) command manually.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the c(onfiguration ambiguous)
state is displayed for a queue instance this indicates that
the configuration specified for this queue instance in
sge_conf(5) is ambiguous. This <br>
state is cleared when the configuration becomes unambiguous
again. This state prevents further jobs from being scheduled
to that queue instance. Detailed reasons why a queue <br>
instance entered the c(onfiguration ambiguous) state can be
found in the sge_qmaster(8) messages file and are shown by
the qstat -explain switch. For queue instances in this <br>
state the cluster queue&rsquo;s default settings are used
for the ambiguous attribute.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If an o(rphaned) state is
displayed for a queue instance, it indicates that the queue
instance is no longer demanded by the current cluster
queue&rsquo;s configuration or the host <br>
group configuration. The queue instance is kept because jobs
which not yet finished jobs are still associated with it,
and it will vanish from qstat output when these jobs have
<br>
finished. To quicken vanishing of an orphaned queue instance
associated job(s) can be deleted using qdel(1). A queue
instance in (o)rphaned state can be revived by changing the
<br>
cluster queue configuration accordingly to cover that queue
instance. This state prevents from scheduling further jobs
to that queue instance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -F option was used,
resource availability information is printed following the
queue status line. For each resource (as selected in an
option argument to -F or for all <br>
resources if the option argument was omitted) a single line
is displayed with the following format:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; a one letter
specifier indicating whether the current resource
availability value was dominated by either <br>
&lsquo;g&rsquo; - a cluster global, <br>
&lsquo;h&rsquo; - a host total or <br>
&lsquo;q&rsquo; - a queue related resource consumption.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; a second one
letter specifier indicating the source for the current
resource availability value, being one of <br>
&lsquo;l&rsquo; - a load value reported for the resource,
<br>
&lsquo;L&rsquo; - a load value for the resource after
administrator defined load scaling has been applied, <br>
&lsquo;c&rsquo; - availability derived from the consumable
resources facility (see complexes(5)), <br>
&lsquo;f&rsquo; - a fixed availability definition derived
from a non-consumable complex attribute or a fixed resource
limit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; after a colon
the name of the resource on which information is
displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; after an equal
sign the current resource availability value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The displayed availability
values and the sources from which they derive are always the
minimum values of all possible combinations. Hence, for
example, a line of the form <br>
&quot;qf:h_vmem=4G&quot; indicates that a queue currently
has a maximum availability in virtual memory of 4 Gigabyte,
where this value is a fixed value (e.g. a resource limit in
the queue <br>
configuration) and it is queue dominated, i.e. the host in
total may have more virtual memory available than this, but
the queue doesn&rsquo;t allow for more. Contrarily a line
<br>
&quot;hl:h_vmem=4G&quot; would also indicate an upper bound
of 4 Gigabyte virtual memory availability, but the limit
would be derived from a load value currently reported for
the host. So <br>
while the queue might allow for jobs with higher virtual
memory requirements, the host on which this particular queue
resides currently only has 4 Gigabyte available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -explain option was used
with the character &rsquo;a&rsquo; or &rsquo;A&rsquo;,
information about resources is displayed, that violate load
or suspend thresholds. <br>
The same format as with the -F option is used with following
extensions:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; the line starts
with the keyword &lsquo;alarm&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; appended to the
resource value is the type and value of the appropriate
threshold</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After the queue status line (in
case of -f) or the resource availability information (in
case of -F) a single line is printed for each job running
currently in this queue. Each <br>
job status line contains</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; the job ID,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; the priority of
the job determining its position in the pending jobs list.
The priority value is determined dynamically based on ticket
and urgency policy set-up (see also <br>
sge_priority(5) ).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; the job
name,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; the job owner
name,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; the status of
the job - one of t(ransfering), r(unning), R(estarted),
s(uspended), S(uspended) or T(hreshold) (see the Reduced
Format section for detailed information),</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; the submission
or start time and date of the job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; the number of
job slots or the function of parallel job tasks if -g t is
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Without -g t option the number
of slots occupied per queue resp. requested by the job is
displayed. For pending parallel jobs with a PE slot range
request, the assumed future <br>
slot allocation is displayed. With -g t option the function
of the running jobs (MASTER or SLAVE - the latter for
parallel jobs only) is displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -t option is supplied,
each job status line also contains</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; the task ID,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; the status of
the task - one of r(unning), R(estarted), s(uspended),
S(uspended), T(hreshold), w(aiting), h(old), or x(exited)
(see the Reduced Format section for detailed <br>
information),</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; the cpu, memory,
and I/O usage,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; the exit status
of the task,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; and the failure
code and message for the task.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Following the list of queue
sections a PENDING JOBS list may be printed in case jobs are
waiting for being assigned to a queue. A status line for
each waiting job is displayed <br>
being similar to the one for the running jobs. The
differences are that the status for the jobs is w(aiting) or
h(old), that the submit time and date is shown instead of
the <br>
start time and that no function is displayed for the
jobs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In very rare cases, e.g. if
sge_qmaster(8) starts up from an inconsistent state in the
job or queue spool files or if the clean queue (-cq) option
of qconf(1) is used, qstat can&acirc; <br>
not assign jobs to either the running or pending jobs
section of the output. In this case as job status
inconsistency (e.g. a job has a running status but is not
assigned to a <br>
queue) has been detected. Such jobs are printed in an ERROR
JOBS section at the very end of the output. The ERROR JOBS
section should disappear upon restart of sge_qmaster(8).
<br>
Please contact your Sun Grid Engine support representative
if you feel uncertain about the cause or effects of such
jobs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Expanded Format (with -r) <br>
If the -r option was specified together with qstat, the
following information for each displayed job is printed (a

master queue name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The hard and
soft resource requirements of the job as specified with the

printed (see also sge_priority(5)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The requested
parallel environment including the desired queue slot range
(see -pe option of qsub(1)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The requested

SGE_ROOT Specifies the location of the Sun Grid Engine
standard configuration files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SGE_CELL If set, specifies the
default Sun Grid Engine cell. To address a Sun Grid Engine
cell qstat uses (in the order of precedence):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The name of the cell specified
in the environment variable SGE_CELL, if it is set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The name of the default cell,
i.e. default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SGE_DEBUG_LEVEL <br>
If set, specifies that debug information should be written
to stderr. In addition the level of detail in which debug
information is generated is defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SGE_QMASTER_PORT <br>
If set, specifies the tcp port on which sge_qmaster(8) is
expected to listen for communication requests. Most
installations will use a services map entry for the <br>
service &quot;sge_qmaster&quot; instead to define that
port.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SGE_LONG_QNAMES <br>
Qstat does display queue names up to 30 characters. If that
is to much or not enough, one can set a custom length with
this variable. The minimum display length is <br>
10 characters. If one does not know the best display length,
one can set SGE_LONG_QNAMES to -1 and qstat will figure out
the best length.</p>
