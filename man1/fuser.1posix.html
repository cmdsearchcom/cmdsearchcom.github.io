<p>FUSER(1POSIX) POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s Manual
FUSER(1POSIX)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROLOG <br>
This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s
Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of <br>
Linux behavior), or the interface may not be implemented on
Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
fuser &acirc; list process IDs of all processes that have
one or more files open</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
fuser [&acirc;cfu] file...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The fuser utility shall write to standard output the process
IDs of processes running on the local system that have one
or more named files open. For block special devices, all
<br>
processes using any file on that device are listed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The fuser utility shall write to
standard error additional information about the named files
indicating how the file is being used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any output for processes running
on remote systems that have a named file open is
unspecified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A user may need appropriate
privileges to invoke the fuser utility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The fuser utility shall conform to the Base Definitions
volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax
Guidelines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options shall be
supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;c The file is treated as
a mount point and the utility shall report on any files open
in the file system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;f The report shall be
only for the named files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;u The user name, in
parentheses, associated with each process ID written to
standard output shall be written to standard error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERANDS <br>
The following operand shall be supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file A pathname on which the
file or file system is to be reported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDIN <br>
Not used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUT FILES <br>
The user database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
The following environment variables shall affect the
execution of fuser:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LANG Provide a default value for
the internationalization variables that are unset or null.
(See the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008,
Section 8.2, Internationaliza&acirc; <br>
tion Variables for the precedence of internationalization
variables used to determine the values of locale
categories.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_ALL If set to a non-empty
string value, override the values of all the other
internationalization variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_CTYPE Determine the locale
for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text data as
characters (for example, single-byte as opposed to
multi-byte characters in argu&acirc; <br>
ments).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_MESSAGES <br>
Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
standard error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NLSPATH Determine the location
of message catalogs for the processing of LC_MESSAGES.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDOUT <br>
The fuser utility shall write the process ID for each
process using each file given as an operand to standard
output in the following format:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;%d&quot;,
&lt;process_id&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDERR <br>
The fuser utility shall write diagnostic messages to
standard error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The fuser utility also shall
write the following to standard error:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The pathname of each named
file is written followed immediately by a &lt;colon&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* For each process ID written to
standard output, the character &rsquo;c&rsquo; shall be
written to standard error if the process is using the file
as its current directory and the charac&acirc; <br>
ter &rsquo;r&rsquo; shall be written to standard error if
the process is using the file as its root directory.
Implementations may write other alphabetic characters to
indicate other <br>
uses of files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* When the &acirc;u option is
specified, characters indicating the use of the file shall
be followed immediately by the user name, in parentheses,
corresponding to the real user ID <br>
of the process. If the user name cannot be resolved from the
real user ID of the process, the real user ID of the process
shall be written instead of the user name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When standard output and
standard error are directed to the same file, the output
shall be interleaved so that the filename appears at the
start of each line, followed by the <br>
process ID and characters indicating the use of the file.
Then, if the &acirc;u option is specified, the user name or
user ID for each process using that file shall be
written.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A &lt;newline&gt; shall be
written to standard error after the last output described
above for each file operand.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT FILES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTENDED DESCRIPTION <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The following exit values shall be returned:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 Successful completion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following sections are
informative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">APPLICATION USAGE <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
The command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fuser &acirc;fu .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">writes to standard output the
process IDs of processes that are using the current
directory and writes to standard error an indication of how
those processes are using the direc&acirc; <br>
tory and the user names associated with the processes that
are using the current directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fuser &acirc;c &lt;mount
point&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">writes to standard output the
process IDs of processes that are using any file in the file
system which is mounted on &lt;mount point&gt; and writes to
standard error an indication of <br>
how those processes are using the files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fuser &lt;mount point&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">writes to standard output the
process IDs of processes that are using the file which is
named by &lt;mount point&gt; and writes to standard error an
indication of how those processes <br>
are using the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fuser &lt;block device&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">writes to standard output the
process IDs of processes that are using any file which is on
the device named by &lt;block device&gt; and writes to
standard error an indication of how <br>
those processes are using the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fuser &acirc;f &lt;block
device&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">writes to standard output the
process IDs of processes that are using the file &lt;block
device&gt; itself and writes to standard error an indication
of how those processes are using <br>
the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RATIONALE <br>
The definition of the fuser utility follows existing
practice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FUTURE DIRECTIONS <br>
None.</p>
