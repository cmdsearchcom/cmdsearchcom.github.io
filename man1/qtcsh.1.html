<p>QTCSH(1) Grid Engine User Commands QTCSH(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
qtcsh - tcsh with transparent remote execution by use of
qrsh</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNTAX <br>
qtcsh [ tcsh options | -ABLR ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Qtcsh is an extension to the popular csh(1) derivative tcsh.
It allows the transparent remote execution of commands
entered in qtcsh controlled via Grid Engine. Qtcsh can be
<br>
used as interactive command interpreter as well as for the
processing of tcsh shell scripts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When invoked, qtcsh identifies
which commands are to be run remotely and which are not. For
this purpose the files
&lt;sge_root&gt;/&lt;cell&gt;/common/qtask and ~/.qtask are
processed. Each <br>
line in these files defines a command that is intended to be
run remotely (see qtask(5) for a definition of the file
format). The .qtask file in the user&rsquo;s home directory
con&acirc; <br>
tains the user&rsquo;s remote task specification, while the
file in the common directory is maintained by the
administrator and defines a cluster-wide default behavior.
The contents <br>
of the administrator supplied qtask(5) file are completely
overridden in case there is an appropriate entry in the
users qtask(5) file. This is prevented in case an
exclamation <br>
mark is prefixed to the command name in the administrators
qtask file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Qtcsh always attempts to start
the designated tasks remotely via qrsh(1). Exceptions
are</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; if the user
enters such commands via a relative or absolute pathname
instead of the stand-alone command name (see qtask(5) for
more information);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; if the
environment variable JOB_ID is set and thus qtcsh assumes
that execution already happens remotely within a Grid Engine
job and thus executes tasks locally. This avoids <br>
unwanted recursions but can be overridden by the
command-line option -R and the built-in command qrshmode -R
(see corresponding descriptions below);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; if qtcsh cannot
establish a connection of Grid Engine during start-up. This
allows using qtcsh as a login shell without the danger of
being blocked when no Grid Engine service <br>
is available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Qtcsh can operate in three
different modes determining whether</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; tasks are
executed remotely;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; immediate or
batch execution is requested;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; status output is
verbose or only in case of any errors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These modes either can be
controlled by the command-line switches described below
during qtcsh invocation or within an executing qtcsh via the
built-in command qrshmode, as <br>
described in section BUILT-IN COMMANDS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The options listed below are specific to qtcsh. The user is
referred to the tcsh(1) documentation for the explanation of
further options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A Switches qtcsh into verbose
mode, causing diagnostic output in case of remote
execution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B Switches remote task
execution into batch mode. Tasks submitted to Grid Engine
will be queued if they cannot start immediately. As a
consequence, qtcsh may block until <br>
the queued task can be started by Grid Engine. While this
behavior probably is undesirable during an interactive
session, it may be very useful for execution of shell <br>
scripts through qtcsh, as it avoids failure of the scripts
due to temporarily unavailable resources for particular
tasks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L Switches off the default
behavior of remote execution of commands. Causes all
commands to be executed locally even if they are contained
in one of the qtask(5) files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R Enforces remote execution of
commands even if JOB_ID is set as environment variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUILT-IN COMMANDS <br>
This section only describes additional shell builtin
commands which are not available in standard tcsh(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">qrshmode [-ANBILR] <br>
Without options, the current operational mode of qtcsh is
displayed. The options have the following effect:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A switch to verbose output mode
<br>
-N switch to non-verbose output mode <br>
-B switch to batch execution mode <br>
-I switch to immediate execution mode <br>
-L always execute commands locally <br>
-R execute configured commands remotely</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
SGE_ROOT Specifies the location of the Grid Engine standard
configuration files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SGE_CELL If set, specifies the
default Grid Engine cell. To address a Grid Engine cell
qtcsh uses (in the order of precedence):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The name of the cell specified
in the environment variable SGE_CELL, if it is set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The name of the default cell,
i.e. default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SGE_DEBUG_LEVEL <br>
If set, specifies that debug information should be written
to stderr. In addition the level of detail in which debug
information is generated is defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SGE_QMASTER_PORT <br>
If set, specifies the tcp port on which sge_qmaster(8) is
expected to listen for communication requests. Most
installations will use a services map entry for the <br>
service &quot;sge_qmaster&quot; instead to define that
port.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">JOB_ID If set when starting
qtcsh the local operation mode is activated implicitly as if
the -L option was specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
~/.qtask user qtask file. <br>
&lt;sge_root&gt;/&lt;cell&gt;/common/qtask <br>
cluster qtask file.</p>
