<b>hapolicy</b> [OPTIONS] --service=SERVICE1 [--service=SERVICE2 ...]
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        Services:
        -s, --service &lt;name&gt;=&lt;address&gt;:&lt;port&gt;[:&lt;prio&gt;:&lt;weight&gt;:&lt;timeout&gt;]
        Options:
        -d, --default &lt;action&gt;  returns &lt;action&gt; if no service was available (default: 'dunno')
        -l, --logging           log requests
        -v, --verbose           increase logging verbosity
        -L, --stdout            log to stdout, for debugging, do NOT use with postfix

<b>hapolicy</b> enables high availability, weighted loadbalancing and a fallback
  action for postfix policy delegation services. Invoked via postfix spawn it
  acts as a wrapper that queries other policy servers via tcp connection. The
  order of the service queries can be influenced by assigning a specific
  priority and weight to each service. A service is considered 'failing', if the
  connection is refused or the specified service timeout is reached. If all of
  the configured policy services were failing, <b>hapolicy</b> returns a default
  action (e.g. dunno) to postfix.
<div class="Pp"></div>
With version 1.00 <b>hapolicy</b> has less than 200 lines of perl code using
  only standard perl modules. It does not require any disk access nor
  configuration files and runs under an unpriviledged user account. This should
  allow fast and reliable operation.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="CONFIGURATION"><a class="selflink" href="#CONFIGURATION">CONFIGURATION</a></h2>
A service has the following attributes
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    &quot;servicename&quot;           =&gt; {
               ip              =&gt; '127.0.0.1',         # ip address
               port            =&gt; '10040',             # tcp port
               prio            =&gt; '10',                # optional, lower wins
               weight          =&gt; '1',                 # optional, for items with same prio (weighted round-robin), higher is better
               timeout         =&gt; '30',                # optional, query timeout in seconds
    },
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
You may define multiple services at the command line. Which means that
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        hapolicy -s &quot;grey1=10.0.0.1:10031:10&quot; -s &quot;grey2=10.0.0.2:10031:20&quot;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
will always try first service <i>grey1</i> at ip 10.0.0.1 port 10031 and if that
  service is not available or does not answer within the default of 30 seconds
  the next service <i>grey2</i> at ip 10.0.0.2 port 10031 will be queried.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you want to load balance connections you may define
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        hapolicy -s &quot;polw1=10.0.0.1:12525:10:2&quot; -s &quot;polw2=10.0.0.2:12525:10:1&quot;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
which queries service <i>polw1</i> at ip 10.0.0.1 twice as much as service
  <i>polw2</i> at ip 10.0.0.2. Note that this setup also ensures high
  availability for both services. If <i>polw1</i> is not available or does not
  answer within the default of 30 seconds <i>polw2</i> will be queried and vice
  versa. There is no reason to define a service twice.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="INTEGRATION"><a class="selflink" href="#INTEGRATION">INTEGRATION</a></h2>
Enter the following at the bottom of your postfix master.cf (usually located at
  /etc/postfix):
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        # service description, note the leading blanks at the second line
        127.0.0.1:10060 inet    n       n       n       -       0       spawn
          user=nobody argv=/usr/local/bin/hapolicy -l -s GREY1=10.0.0.1:10031:10 -s GREY2=10.0.0.2:10031:10
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
save the file and open postfix main.cf. Modify it as follows:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        127.0.0.1:10060_time_limit   = 3600
        smtpd_recipient_restrictions =
            permit_mynetworks,
            ... other authed permits ...
            reject_unauth_destination,
            ... other restrictions ...
            check_policy_service inet:127.0.0.1:10060   # &lt;- hapolicy query
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Now issue 'postfix reload' at the command line. Of course you can have more
  enhanced setups using postfix restriction classes. Please see
  &quot;LINKS&quot; for further options.
