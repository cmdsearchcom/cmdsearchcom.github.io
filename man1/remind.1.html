remind - a sophisticated reminder service
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<b>remind [<i>options</i>] <i>filename</i> [<i>date</i>] [<i>*rep</i>]
  [<i>time</i>]</b>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>Remind</b> reads the supplied <i>filename</i> and executes the commands found
  in it. The commands are used to issue reminders and alarms. Each reminder or
  alarm can consist of a message sent to standard output, or a program to be
  executed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If <i>filename</i> is specified as a single dash '-', then <b>Remind</b> takes
  its input from standard input. This also implicitly enables the <b>-o</b>
  option, described below.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If <i>filename</i> happens to be a directory rather than a plain file, then
  <b>Remind</b> reads all of the files in that directory that match the pattern
  &quot;*.rem&quot;. The files are read in sorted order; the sort order may
  depend on your locale, but should match the sort order used by the shell to
  expand &quot;*.rem&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Remind</b> reads its files starting from the beginning to the end, or until
  it encounters a line whose sole content is &quot;__EOF__&quot; (without the
  quotes.) Anything after the __EOF__ marker is completely ignored.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
<b>Remind</b> has a slew of options. If you're new to the program, ignore them
  for now and skip to the section &quot;Reminder Files&quot;.

</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
to have all of your <b>MSG</b>-type reminders processed using xmessage.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A word of warning: It is very easy to spawn dozens of xmessage processes with
  the above technique. So be very careful. Because all shell and whitespace
  characters are escaped, the program you execute with the <b>-k</b> option must
  be prepared to handle the entire message as a single argument.</div>

      and sets the environment variables HOME, SHELL and USER to the home
      directory, shell, and user name, respectively, of the specified user.
      LOGNAME is also set to the specified user name. This option is meant for
      use in shell scripts that mail reminders to all users. Note that as of
      Remind 3.00.17, using <b>-u</b> implies <b>-r</b> -- the RUN directive and

If you supply a <i>date</i> on the command line, it must consist of <i>day month
  year</i>, where <i>day</i> is the day of the month, <i>month</i> is at least
  the first three letters of the English name of the month, and <i>year</i> is a
  year (all 4 digits) from 1990 to about 2075. You can leave out the <i>day</i>,
  which then defaults to 1.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you do supply a <i>date</i> on the command line, then <b>Remind</b> uses it,
  rather than the actual system date, as its notion of &quot;today.&quot; This
  lets you create calendars for future months, or test to see how your reminders
  will be triggered in the future. Similarly, you can supply a <i>time</i> (in
  24-hour format -- for example, 17:15) to set <b>Remind</b>'s notion of
  &quot;now&quot; to a particular time. Supplying a <i>time</i> on the command
  line also implicitly enables the <b>-q</b> option and disables the <b>-z</b>
  option.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you would rather specify the date more succinctly, you can supply it as
  YYYY-MM-DD or YYYY/MM/DD. You can even supply a date and time on the command
  line as one argument: YYYY-MM-DD@HH:MM.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In addition, you can supply a <i>repeat</i> parameter, which has the form *
  <i>num</i>. This causes <b>Remind</b> to be run <i>num</i> times, with the
  date incrementing on each iteration. You may have to enclose the parameter in
  quotes to avoid shell expansion. See the subsection &quot;Repeated
  Execution&quot; in the section &quot;Calendar Mode&quot; for more information.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="REMINDER_FILES"><a class="selflink" href="#REMINDER_FILES">REMINDER
  FILES</a></h1>
<b>Remind</b> uses scripts to control its operation. You can use any text editor
  capable of creating plain ASCII files to create a <b>Remind</b> script. The
  commands inside a script can range from the very simple and almost immediately
  understandable:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
	REM 6 Jan MSG Dianne's birthday
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
to the baroque and obscure:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
	REM [date(thisyear, 1, 1) + 180] ++5 OMIT \
	sat sun BEFORE MSG [ord(thisyear-1980)] payment due %b!
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
A reminder file consists of commands, with one command per line. Several lines
  can be continued using the backslash character, as in the above example. In
  this case, all of the concatenated lines are treated as a single line by
  <b>Remind</b>. Note that if an error occurs, <b>Remind</b> reports the line
  number of the last line of a continued line.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Remind</b> ignores blank lines, and lines beginning with the '#' or ';'
  characters. You can use the semicolon as a comment character if you wish to
  pass a <b>Remind</b> script through the C pre-processor, which interprets the
  '#' character as the start of a pre-processing directive.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that <b>Remind</b> processes line continuations before anything else. For
  example:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
	# This is a comment \
	This line is part of the comment because of line continuation \
	and so on.
	REM MSG This line is not ignored (no \ above)
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Remind</b> is not case sensitive; you can generally use any mixture of upper-
  or lower-case for commands, parameters, invocation options, etc.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="THE_REM_COMMAND"><a class="selflink" href="#THE_REM_COMMAND">THE
  REM COMMAND</a></h1>
The most powerful command in a <b>Remind</b> script is the <b>REM</b> command.
  This command is responsible for issuing reminders. Its syntax is:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"><b>REM</b> [<b>ONCE</b>] [<i>date_spec</i>] [
  <i>back</i>] [ <i>delta</i>] [ <i>repeat</i>] [ <b>PRIORITY</b> <i>prio</i>] [
  <b>SKIP</b> | <b>BEFORE</b> | <b>AFTER</b>] [ <b>OMIT</b> <i>omit_list</i>] [
  <b>OMITFUNC</b> <i>omit_function</i>] [ <b>AT</b> <i>time</i> [<i>tdelta</i>]
  [ <i>trepeat</i>]] [ <b>SCHED</b> <i>sched_function</i>] [ <b>WARN</b>
  <i>warn_function</i>] [ <b>UNTIL</b> <i>expiry_date</i> | <b>THROUGH</b>
  <i>last_date</i>] [ <b>SCANFROM</b> <i>scan_date</i> | <b>FROM</b>
  <i>start_date</i>] [ <b>DURATION</b> <i>duration</i>] [ <b>TAG</b> <i>tag</i>]
  &lt; <b>MSG</b> | <b>MSF</b> | <b>RUN</b> | <b>CAL</b> | <b>SATISFY</b> |
  <b>SPECIAL</b> <i>special</i> | <b>PS</b> | <b>PSFILE</b>&gt;
  <i>body</i></div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The parts of the <b>REM</b> command can be specified in any order, except that
  the <i>body</i> must come immediately after the <b>MSG</b>, <b>RUN</b>,
  <b>CAL</b>, <b>PS</b>, <b>PSFILE</b> or <b>SATISFY</b> keyword.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>REM</b> token is optional, providing that the remainder of the command
  cannot be mistaken for another <b>Remind</b> command such as <b>OMIT</b> or
  <b>RUN</b>. The portion of the <b>REM</b> command before the <b>MSG</b>,
  <b>MSF</b> <b>RUN</b>, <b>CAL</b> or <b>SATISFY</b> clause is called a
  <i>trigger</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>MSG, MSF, RUN, CAL, SPECIAL, PS and PSFILE</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
These keywords denote the <i>type</i> of the reminder. ( <b>SATISFY</b> is more
  complicated and will be explained later.) A <b>MSG</b>-type reminder normally
  prints a message to the standard output, after passing the <i>body</i> through
  a special substitution filter, described in the section &quot;The Substitution
  Filter.&quot; However, if you have used the <b>-k</b> command-line option,
  then <b>MSG</b>-type reminders are passed to the appropriate program. Note
  that the options <b>-c</b>, <b>-s</b>, <b>-p</b> and <b>-n</b> disable the
  <b>-k</b> option.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that you can omit the reminder type, in which case it defaults to
  <b>MSG</b>. So you can write:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
	6 January Dianne's Birthday
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
although this is not recommended.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>MSF</b> keyword is almost the same as the <b>MSG</b> keyword, except that
  the reminder is formatted to fit into a paragraph-like format. Three system
  variables control the formatting of <b>MSF</b>-type reminders - they are
  <b>$FirstIndent</b>, <b>$SubsIndent</b> and <b>$FormWidth</b>. They are
  discussed in the section &quot;System Variables.&quot; The <b>MSF</b> keyword
  causes the spacing of your reminder to be altered - extra spaces are
  discarded, and two spaces are placed after periods and other characters, as
  specified by the system variables <b>$EndSent</b> and <b>$EndSentIg</b>. Note
  that if the body of the reminder includes newline characters (placed there
  with the %_ sequence), then the newlines are treated as the beginnings of new
  paragraphs, and the <b>$FirstIndent</b> indentation is used for the next line.
  You can use two consecutive newlines to have spaced paragraphs emitted from a
  single reminder body.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A <b>RUN</b>-type reminder also passes the <i>body</i> through the substitution
  filter, but then executes the result as a system command. A <b>CAL</b>-type
  reminder is used only to place entries in the calendar produced when
  <b>Remind</b> is run with the <b>-c</b>, <b>-s</b> or <b>-p</b> options.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A <b>PS</b> or <b>PSFILE</b>-type reminder is used to pass PostScript code
  directly to the printer when producing PostScript calendars. This can be used
  to shade certain calendar entries (see the psshade() function), include
  graphics in the calendar, or almost any other purpose you can think of. You
  should not use these types of reminders unless you are an expert PostScript
  programmer. The <b>PS</b> and <b>PSFILE</b> reminders are ignored unless
  <b>Remind</b> is run with the <b>-p</b> option. See the section &quot;More
  about PostScript&quot; for more details.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A <b>SPECIAL</b>-type reminder is used to pass &quot;out-of-band&quot;
  information from <b>Remind</b> to a calendar-producing back-end. It should be
  followed by a word indicating the type of special data being passed. The type
  of a special reminder depends on the back-end. For the <b>Rem2PS</b> back-end,
  <b>SPECIAL PostScript</b> is equivalent to a <b>PS</b>-type reminder, and
  <b>SPECIAL PSFile</b> is equivalent to a <b>PSFILE</b>-type reminder. The body
  of a <b>SPECIAL</b> reminder is obviously dependent upon the back-end.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>DATE SPECIFICATIONS</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
A <i>date_spec</i> consists of zero to four parts. These parts are <i>day</i>
  (day of month), <i>month</i> (month name), <i>year</i> and <i>weekday.</i>
  <i>Month</i> and <i>weekday</i> are the English names of months and weekdays.
  At least the first three characters must be used. The following are examples
  of the various parts of a <i>date_spec:</i>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><i>day:</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">1, 22, 31, 14, 3</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><i>month:</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">JANUARY, feb, March, ApR, may, Aug</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><i>year:</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">1990, 1993, 2030, 95 (interpreted as 1995). The year can
      range from 1990 to 2075.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><i>weekday:</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Monday, tue, Wed, THU, Friday, saturday, sundAy</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that there can be several <i>weekday</i> components separated by spaces in
  a <i>date_spec.</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>INTERPRETATION OF DATE SPECIFICATIONS</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The following examples show how date specifications are interpreted.
<div class="Pp"></div>
1. Null date specification - the reminder is triggered every day. The trigger
  date for a specific run is simply the current system date.
<div class="Pp"></div>
2. Only <i>day</i> present. The reminder is triggered on the specified day of
  each month. The trigger date for a particular run is the closest such day to
  the current system date. For example:
<pre>
	REM 1 MSG First of every month.
	REM 31 MSG 31st of every month that has 31 days.
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
3. Only <i>month</i> present. The reminder is triggered every day of the
  specified month. Example:
<pre>
	REM Feb MSG Every day in February
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
4. <i>day</i> and <i>month</i> present. Examples:
<pre>
	REM 6 Jan MSG Every 6th of January
	REM Feb 29 MSG Every 29th of February
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
5. Only <i>year</i> present. Example:
<pre>
	REM 1991 MSG Every day in 1991
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
6. <i>year</i> and <i>day</i> present. Examples:
<pre>
	REM 1 1990 MSG 1st of every month in 1990
	REM 1992 23 MSG 23rd of every month in 1992
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
7. <i>year</i> and <i>month</i> present. Examples:
<pre>
	REM Feb 1991 MSG Every day in Feb 1991
	REM 1992 September MSG Every day in Sept 1992
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
8. <i>year, month</i> and <i>day</i> present. Examples:
<pre>
	REM 8 Jan 1991 MSG 8th January 1991.
	REM 1992 March 9 MSG 9th March 1992.
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
9. <i>weekday</i> only. Examples:
<pre>
	REM Sat MSG Every Saturday
	REM Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri MSG Every working day
	REM Monday Wednesday MSG Every Monday and Wednesday
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
10. <i>weekday</i> and <i>day</i> present. Examples:
<pre>
	REM Sat 1 MSG First Saturday of every month
	REM Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri 15 \
		MSG 1st working day after 15th of every month
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
11. <i>weekday</i> and <i>month</i> present. Examples:
<pre>
	REM Mon March MSG Every Monday in March
	REM Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Feb MSG Every working day in February
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
12. <i>weekday, month</i> and <i>day</i> present. Examples:
<pre>
	REM Mon 1 March MSG First Monday in March
	REM Sat Sun 15 July MSG First Sat or Sun on or after 15 July
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
13. <i>weekday</i> and <i>year</i> present. Example:
<pre>
	REM Sat Sun 1991 MSG Every Saturday and Sunday in 1991
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
14. <i>weekday, day</i> and <i>year</i> present. Examples:
<pre>
	REM Mon 15 1990 MSG 1st Mon after 15th of every month in 1990
	REM Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri 1 1990 \
		MSG 1st working day of every month in 1990
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
15. <i>weekday, month</i> and <i>year</i> present. Example:
<pre>
	REM Mon Wed 1991 Feb MSG Every Mon and Wed in Feb 1991.
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
16. <i>weekday, day, month</i> and <i>year</i> present. Example:
<pre>
	REM Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri 28 Oct 1990 \
		MSG 1st working day on or after 28 October 1990.
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that when both <i>weekday</i> and <i>day</i> are specified, <b>Remind</b>
  chooses the first date on or after the specified <i>day</i> that also
  satisfies the <i>weekday</i> constraint. It does this by picking the first
  date on or after the specified <i>day</i> that is listed in the list of
  <i>weekdays.</i> Thus, a reminder like:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
	REM Mon Tue 28 Oct 1990 MSG Hi
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
would be issued only on Monday, 29 October, 1990. It would not be issued on
  Tuesday, 30 October, 1990, since the 29th is the first date to satisfy the
  <i>weekday</i> constraints.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>SHORT-HAND DATE SPECIFICATIONS</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
In addition to spelling out the day, month and year separately, you can specify
  YYYY-MM-DD or YYYY/MM/DD. For example, the following statements are
  equivalent:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
	REM 5 June 2010 MSG Cool!
	REM 2010-06-05  MSG Cool!
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can also specify a date and time as YYYY-MM-DD@HH:MM. These statements are
  equivalent:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
	REM 19 Dec 2010 AT 16:45 MSG Hi
	REM 2010-12-19@16:45 MSG Hi
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
There's one subtlety with short-hand date specifications: The following
  statements are <i>not</i> equivalent:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
	REM 19 Dec 2010 AT 16:45 +60 MSG Hi
	REM 2010-12-19@16:45 +60 MSG Hi
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
In the second statement, the &quot;+60&quot; is a <i>delta</i> that applies to
  the date rather than a <i>tdelta</i> that applies to the time. We recommend
  explicitly using the AT keyword with timed reminders.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>THE REMIND ALGORITHM</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Remind</b> uses the following algorithm to compute a trigger date: Starting
  from the current date, it examines each day, one at a time, until it finds a
  date that satisfies the date specification, or proves to itself that no such
  date exists. (Actually, <b>Remind</b> merely <i>behaves</i> as if it used this
  algorithm; it would be much too slow in practice. Internally, <b>Remind</b>
  uses much faster techniques to calculate a trigger date.) See DETAILS ABOUT
  TRIGGER COMPUTATION for more information.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>BACKWARD SCANNING</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Sometimes, it is necessary to specify a date as being a set amount of time
  before another date. For example, the last Monday in a given month is computed
  as the first Monday in the next month, minus 7 days. The <i>back</i>
  specification in the reminder is used in this case:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
	REM Mon 1 -7 MSG Last Monday of every month.
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
A <i>back</i> is specified with one or two dashes followed by an integer. This
  causes <b>Remind</b> to move &quot;backwards&quot; from what would normally be
  the trigger date. The difference between --7 and -7 will be explained when the
  <b>OMIT</b> keyword is described.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>ADVANCE WARNING</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
For some reminders, it is appropriate to receive advance warning of the event.
  For example, you may wish to be reminded of someone's birthday several days in
  advance. The <i>delta</i> portion of the <b>REM</b> command achieves this. It
  is specified as one or two &quot;+&quot; signs followed by a number <i>n</i>.
  Again, the difference between the &quot;+&quot; and &quot;++&quot; forms will
  be explained under the <b>OMIT</b> keyword. <b>Remind</b> will trigger the
  reminder on computed trigger date, as well as on each of the <i>n</i> days
  before the event. Here are some examples:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
	REM 6 Jan +5 MSG Remind me of birthday 5 days in advance.
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The above example would be triggered every 6th of January, as well as the 1st
  through 5th of January.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>PERIODIC REMINDERS</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
We have already seen some built-in mechanisms for certain types of periodic
  reminders. For example, an event occurring every Wednesday could be specified
  as:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
	REM Wed MSG Event!
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
However, events that do not repeat daily, weekly, monthly or yearly require
  another approach. The <i>repeat</i> component of the <b>REM</b> command fills
  this need. To use it, you must completely specify a date (year, month and day,
  and optionally weekday.) The <i>repeat</i> component is an asterisk followed
  by a number specifying the repetition period in days.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For example, suppose you get paid every second Wednesday, and your last payday
  was Wednesday, 28 October, 1992. You can use:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
	REM 28 Oct 1992 *14 MSG Payday
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This issues the reminder every 14 days, starting from the calculated trigger
  date. You can use <i>delta</i> and <i>back</i> with <i>repeat.</i> Note,
  however, that the <i>back</i> is used only to compute the initial trigger
  date; thereafter, the reminder repeats with the specified period. Similarly,
  if you specify a weekday, it is used only to calculate the initial date, and
  does not affect the repetition period.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>SCANFROM and<b> FROM</b></b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>SCANFROM</b> and <b>FROM</b> keywords are for advanced <b>Remind</b>
  programmers only, and will be explained in the section &quot;Details about
  Trigger Computation&quot; near the end of this manual. Note that
  <b>SCANFROM</b> is available only in versions of <b>Remind</b> from 03.00.04
  up. <b>FROM</b> is available only from 03.01.00 and later.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>PRIORITY</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>PRIORITY</b> keyword must be followed by a number from 0 to 9999. It is
  used in calendar mode and when sorting reminders. If two reminders have the
  same trigger date and time, then they are sorted by priority. If the
  <b>PRIORITY</b> keyword is not supplied, a default priority of 5000 is used.
  (This default can be changed by adjusting the system variable
  <b>$DefaultPrio</b>. See the section &quot;System Variables&quot; for more
  information.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>EXPIRY DATES</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Some reminders should be issued periodically for a certain time, but then
  expire. For example, suppose you have a class every Friday, and that your last
  class is on 11 December 1992. You can use:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
	REM Fri UNTIL 11 Dec 1992 MSG Class today.
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Another example: Suppose you have jury duty from 30 November 1992 until 4
  December 1992. The following reminder will issue the message every day of your
  jury duty, as well as 2 days ahead of time:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
	REM 1992-11-30 *1 +2 UNTIL 1992-12-04 MSG Jury duty
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that the <i>repeat</i> of *1 is necessary; without it, the reminder would
  be issued only on 30 November (and the two days preceding.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
As a special case, you can use the <b>THROUGH</b> keyword instead of *1 and
  <b>UNTIL</b>. The following two <b>REM</b> commands are equivalent:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
	REM 1992-11-30 *1 +2 UNTIL 1992-12-04 MSG Jury duty
<div class="Pp"></div>
	REM 1992-11-30 +2 THROUGH 1992-12-04 MSG Jury duty
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>THE ONCE KEYWORD</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Sometimes, it is necessary to ensure that reminders are run only once on a given
  day. For example, if you have a reminder that makes a backup of your files
  every Friday:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
	REM Fri RUN do_backup
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
(Here, <i>do_backup</i> is assumed to be a program or shell script that does the
  work.) If you run <b>Remind</b> from your .login script, for example, and log
  in several times per day, the <i>do_backup</i> program will be run each time
  you log in. If, however, you use the <b>ONCE</b> keyword in the reminder, the
  <b>Remind</b> checks the last access date of the reminder script. If it is the
  same as the current date, <b>Remind</b> assumes that it has already been run,
  and will not issue reminders containing the <b>ONCE</b> keyword.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that if you view or edit your reminder script, the last access date will be
  updated, and the <b>ONCE</b> keyword will not operate properly. If you start
  <b>Remind</b> with the <b>-o</b> option, then the <b>ONCE</b> keyword will be
  ignored.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>LOCALLY OMITTING WEEKDAYS</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>OMIT</b> portion of the <b>REM</b> command is used to &quot;omit&quot;
  certain days when counting the <i>delta</i> or <i>back</i>. It is specified
  using the keyword <b>OMIT</b> followed by a list of weekdays. Its action is
  best illustrated with examples:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
	REM 1 +1 OMIT Sat Sun MSG Important Event
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This reminder is normally triggered on the first of every month, as well as the
  day preceding it. However, if the first of the month falls on a Sunday or
  Monday, then the reminder is triggered starting from the previous Friday. This
  is because the <i>delta</i> of +1 does not count Saturday or Sunday when it
  counts backwards from the trigger date to determine how much advance warning
  to give.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Contrast this with the use of &quot;++1&quot; in the above command. In this
  case, the reminder is triggered on the first of each month, as well as the day
  preceding it. The omitted days are counted.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
	REM 1 -1 OMIT Sat Sun MSG Last working day of month
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Again, in the above example, the <i>back</i> of -1 normally causes the trigger
  date to be the last day of the month. However, because of the <b>OMIT</b>
  clause, if the first of the month falls on a Sunday or Monday, the trigger
  date is moved backwards past the weekend to Friday. (If you have globally
  omitted holidays, the reminder will be moved back past them, also. See
  &quot;The OMIT command&quot; for more details.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
By comparison, if we had used &quot;--1&quot;, the reminder would be triggered
  on the last day of the month, regardless of the <b>OMIT</b>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>COMPUTED LOCAL OMITS</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>OMITFUNC</b> phrase of the <b>REM</b> command allows you to supply a
  function that determines whether or not a date is omitted. The function is
  passed a single parameter of type <b>DATE</b>, and must return a non-zero
  integer if the date is considered &quot;omitted&quot; and 0 otherwise. Here's
  an example:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        FSET _third(x) (day(x) % 3) || \
                       (wkdaynum(x) == 0) || \
                       (wkdaynum(x) == 6)
        REM OMITFUNC _third AFTER MSG Working day divisible by 3
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
In the example above, the reminder is triggered every Monday to Friday whose
  day-of-month number is divisible by three. Here's how it works:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>o</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The <b>OMITFUNC _third</b> portion causes all days for
      which <b>_third(x)</b> returns non-zero to be considered
      &quot;omitted&quot;. This causes all days whose day-of-month number is
      <i>not</i> a multiple of three to be omitted. Note that _third also
      returns non-zero if the weekday is Sunday or Saturday.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>o</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The <b>AFTER</b> keyword causes the reminder to be moved
      after a block of omitted days.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The combination of OMITFUNC and AFTER keyword causes the reminder to be issued
  on all days whose day-of-month number is divisible by three, but not on
  Saturday or Sunday.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that if you use <b>OMITFUNC</b>, then a local <b>OMIT</b> is <i>ignored</i>
  as are <i>all global OMITs</i>. If you want to omit specific weekdays, your
  omit function will need to test for them specifically. If you want to take
  into account the global <b>OMIT</b> context, then your omit function will need
  to test for that explicitly (using the <b>isomitted()</b> function.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that an incorrect <b>OMITFUNC</b> might cause all days to be considered
  omitted. For that reason, when <b>Remind</b> searches through omitted days, it
  terminates the search after the <b>SATISFY</b> iteration limit (command-line
  option <b>-x</b>.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>TIMED REMINDERS</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Timed reminders are those that have an <b>AT</b> keyword followed by a
  <i>time</i> and optional <i>tdelta</i> and <i>trepeat</i>. The <i>time</i>
  must be specified in 24-hour format, with 0:00 representing midnight, 12:00
  representing noon, and 23:59 representing one minute to midnight. You can use
  either a colon or a period to separate the hours from the minutes. That is,
  13:39 and 13.39 are equivalent.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Remind</b> treats timed reminders specially. If the trigger date for a timed
  reminder is the same as the current system date, the reminder is queued for
  later activation. When <b>Remind</b> has finished processing the reminder
  file, it puts itself in the background, and activates timed reminders when the
  system time reached the specified time.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the trigger date is <i>not</i> the same as the system date, the reminder is
  not queued.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For example, the following reminder, triggered every working day, will emit a
  message telling you to leave at 5:00pm:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
	REM Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri AT 17:00 MSG Time to leave!
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The following reminder will be triggered on Thursdays and Fridays, but will only
  be queued on Fridays:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
	REM Fri ++1 AT 13:00 MSG Lunch at 1pm Friday.
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <i>tdelta</i> and <i>trepeat</i> have the same form as a <i>repeat</i> and
  <i>delta</i>, but are specified in minutes. For example, this reminder will be
  triggered at 12:00pm as well as 45 minutes before:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
	REM AT 12:00 +45 MSG Example
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The following will be issued starting at 10:45, every half hour until 11:45, and
  again at noon.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
	REM AT 12:00 +75 *30 MSG Example2
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The &quot;+75&quot; means that the reminder is issued starting 75 minutes before
  noon; in other words, at 10:45. The *30 specifies that the reminder is
  subsequently to be issued every 30 minutes. Note that the reminder is always
  issued at the specified time, even if the <i>tdelta</i> is not a multiple of
  the <i>trepeat</i>. So the above example is issued at 10:45am, 11:15am,
  11:45am, and 12:00pm. Note that in the time specification, there is no
  distinction between the &quot;+&quot; and &quot;++&quot; forms of
  <i>tdelta</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Normally, <b>Remind</b> will issue timed reminders as it processes the reminder
  script, as well as queuing them for later. If you do not want <b>Remind</b> to
  issue the reminders when processing the script, but only to queue them for
  later, use the <b>-a</b> command-line option. If you do not want reminders to
  be queued for later, use the <b>-q</b> command-line option.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Normally, <b>Remind</b> forks a background process to handle queued reminders.
  If you want <b>Remind</b> to remain in the foreground, use the <b>-f</b>
  command-line option. This is useful, for example, in .xinitrc scripts, where
  you can use the command:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
	remind -fa myreminders &amp;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This ensures that when you exit X-Windows, the <b>Remind</b> process is killed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>WARNING ABOUT TIMED REMINDERS</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note: If you use user-defined functions or variables (described later) in the
  bodies of timed reminders, then when the timed reminders are activated, the
  variables and functions have the definitions that were in effect at the end of
  the reminder script. These definitions may <i>not</i> necessarily be those
  that were in effect at the time the reminder was queued.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>THE SCHED AND WARN KEYWORDS</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>SCHED</b> keyword allows more precise control over the triggering of
  timed reminders, and the <b>WARN</b> keyword allows precise control over the
  advance triggering of all types of reminders. However, discussion must be
  deferred until after expressions and user-defined functions are explained. See
  the subsection &quot;Precise Scheduling&quot; further on.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>TAG AND DURATION</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>TAG</b> keyword lets you &quot;tag&quot; certain reminders. This facility
  is used by certain back-ends or systems built around <b>Remind</b>, such as
  <b>TkRemind</b>. These back-ends have specific rules about tags; see their
  documentation for details.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>TAG</b> keyword is followed by a tag consisting of up to 48 characters.
  You can have as many TAG clauses as you like in a given REM statement.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you supply the <b>-y</b> option to <b>Remind</b>, then any reminder that
  lacks a <b>TAG</b> will have one synthesized. The synthesized tag consists of
  the characters &quot;__syn__&quot; followed by the hexadecimal representation
  of the MD5 sum of the REM command line. This lets you give a more-or-less
  unique identifier to each distinct REM command.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>DURATION</b> keyword makes sense only for timed reminders; it specifies
  the duration of an event. Currently, this is not used, but it may be used in
  future by back-ends or scheduling systems built around <b>Remind</b>. For
  example, if you have a 90-minute meeting starting at 1:00pm, you could use:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
	REM 5 March 1999 AT 13:00 DURATION 1:30 MSG Meeting
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that <i>duration</i> is specified in hours and minutes.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="THE_SUBSTITUTION_FILTER"><a class="selflink" href="#THE_SUBSTITUTION_FILTER">THE
  SUBSTITUTION FILTER</a></h1>
Before being processed, the body of a <b>REM</b> command is passed through a
  substitution filter. The filter scans for sequences &quot;%x&quot; (where
  &quot;x&quot; is any letter and certain other characters) and performs
  substitutions as shown below. (All dates refer to the trigger date of the
  reminder.)

      the <b>%1</b> substitution may report that a meeting is in 15 minutes, for
      example, even though it may only be in 2 days time, because a <i>delta</i>
      has triggered the reminder. It is recommended that you use the time

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="THE_OMIT_COMMAND"><a class="selflink" href="#THE_OMIT_COMMAND">THE
  OMIT COMMAND</a></h1>
In addition to being a keyword in the <b>REM</b> command, <b>OMIT</b> is a
  command in its own right. Its syntax is:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"><b>OMIT</b> <i>day</i> <i>month</i>
  [<i>year</i>]
<div class="Pp"></div>
or:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>OMIT</b> <i>day1</i> <i>month1</i> <i>year1</i> <b>THROUGH</b> <i>day2</i>
  <i>month2</i> <i>year2</i></div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>OMIT</b> command is used to &quot;globally&quot; omit certain days
  (usually holidays). These globally-omitted days are skipped by the
  &quot;-&quot; and &quot;+&quot; forms of <i>back</i> and <i>delta</i>. Some
  examples:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
	OMIT 1 Jan
	OMIT 7 Sep 1992
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The first example specifies a holiday that occurs on the same date each year -
  New Year's Day. The second example specifies a holiday that changes each year
  - Labour Day. For these types of holidays, you must create an <b>OMIT</b>
  command for each year. (Later, in the description of expressions and some of
  the more advanced features of <b>Remind</b>, you will see how to automate this
  for some cases.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
As with the REM command, you can use shorthand specifiers for dates; the
  following are equivalent:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
	OMIT 7 Sep 1992
	OMIT 1992-09-07
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
For convenience, you can use a <i>delta</i> and <b>MSG</b> or <b>RUN</b> keyword
  in the <b>OMIT</b> command. The following sequences are equivalent:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
	OMIT 1 Jan
	REM 1 Jan +4 MSG New year's day is %b!
<div class="Pp"></div>
	and
<div class="Pp"></div>
	OMIT 1 Jan +4 MSG New year's day is %b!
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>THROUGH</b> keyword lets you conveniently OMIT a range of days. The
  starting and ending points must be fully-specified (ie, they must include day,
  month and year.). For example, the following sequences are equivalent:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
	OMIT 3 Jan 2011
	OMIT 4 Jan 2011
	OMIT 5 Jan 2011
<div class="Pp"></div>
	and
<div class="Pp"></div>
	OMIT 3 Jan 2011 THROUGH 5 Jan 2011
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can make a THROUGH <b>OMIT</b> do double-duty as a <b>REM</b> command:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
	OMIT 6 Sep 2010 THROUGH 10 Sep 2010 MSG Vacation
</pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can debug your global OMITs with the following command:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
	OMIT DUMP
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The OMIT DUMP command prints the current global omits to standard output.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>THE BEFORE, AFTER AND SKIP KEYWORDS</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Normally, days that are omitted, whether by a global <b>OMIT</b> command or the
  local <b>OMIT</b> or <b>OMITFUNC</b> keywords in a <b>REM</b> statement, only
  affect the counting of the - <i>back</i> or the + <i>delta</i>. For example,
  suppose you have a meeting every Wednesday. Suppose, too, that you have
  indicated 11 Nov as a holiday:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
	OMIT 11 Nov +4 MSG Remembrance Day
	REM Wed +1 MSG Code meeting %b.
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The above sequence will issue a reminder about a meeting for 11 November 1992,
  which is a Wednesday. This is probably incorrect. There are three options:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>BEFORE</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This keyword moves the reminder to before any omitted days.
      Thus, in the above example, use of <b>BEFORE</b> would cause the meeting
      reminder to be triggered on Tuesday, 10 November 1992.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>AFTER</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This keyword moves the reminder to after any omitted days.
      In the above example, the meeting reminder would be triggered on Thursday,
      12 November 1992.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>SKIP</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This keyword causes the reminder to be skipped completely
      on any omitted days. Thus, in the above example, the reminder would not be
      triggered on 11 November 1992. However, it would be triggered as usual on
      the following Wednesday, 18 November 1992.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>BEFORE</b> and <b>AFTER</b> keywords move the trigger date of a reminder
  to before or after a block of omitted days, respectively. Suppose you normally
  run a backup on the first day of the month. However, if the first day of the
  month is a weekend or holiday, you run the backup on the first working day
  following the weekend or holiday. You could use:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
	REM 1 OMIT Sat Sun AFTER RUN do_backup
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Let's examine how the trigger date is computed. The <b>1</b> specifies the first
  day of the month. The local <b>OMIT</b> keyword causes the <b>AFTER</b>
  keyword to move the reminder forward past weekends. Finally, the <b>AFTER</b>
  keyword will keep moving the reminder forward until it has passed any holidays
  specified with global <b>OMIT</b> commands.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="THE_INCLUDE_COMMAND"><a class="selflink" href="#THE_INCLUDE_COMMAND">THE
  INCLUDE COMMAND</a></h1>
<b>Remind</b> allows you to include other files in your reminder script, similar
  to the C preprocessor #include directive. For example, your system
  administrator may maintain a file of holidays or system-wide reminders. You
  can include these in your reminder script as follows:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
	INCLUDE /usr/share/remind/holidays
	INCLUDE /usr/share/remind/reminders
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
(The actual pathnames vary from system to system - ask your system
  administrator.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>INCLUDE</b> files can be nested up to a depth of 8.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you specify a filename of &quot;-&quot; in the <b>INCLUDE</b> command,
  <b>Remind</b> will begin reading from standard input.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you specify a <i>directory</i> as the argument to <b>INCLUDE</b>, then
  <b>Remind</b> will process all files in that directory that match the shell
  patterm &quot;*.rem&quot;. The files are processed in sorted order; the sort
  order matches that used by the shell when it expands &quot;*.rem&quot;.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="THE_RUN_COMMAND"><a class="selflink" href="#THE_RUN_COMMAND">THE
  RUN COMMAND</a></h1>
If you include other files in your reminder script, you may not always entirely
  trust the contents of the other files. For example, they may contain
  <b>RUN</b>-type reminders that could be used to access your files or perform
  undesired actions. The <b>RUN</b> command can restrict this: If you include
  the command <b>RUN OFF</b> in your top-level reminder script, any reminder or
  expression that would normally execute a system command is disabled. <b>RUN
  ON</b> will re-enable the execution of system commands. Note that the <b>RUN
  ON</b> command can <i>only</i> be used in your top-level reminder script; it
  will <i>not</i> work in any files accessed by the <b>INCLUDE</b> command. This
  is to protect you from someone placing a <b>RUN ON</b> command in an included
  file. However, the <b>RUN OFF</b> command can be used at top level or in an
  included file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you run <b>Remind</b> with the <b>-r</b> command-line option, <b>RUN</b>-type
  reminders and the <b>shell()</b> function will be disabled, regardless of any
  <b>RUN</b> commands in the reminder script. However, any command supplied with
  the <b>-k</b> option will still be executed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
One use of the <b>RUN</b> command is to provide a secure interface between
  <b>Remind</b> and the <b>Elm</b> mail system. The <b>Elm</b> system can
  automatically scan incoming mail for reminder or calendar entries, and place
  them in your calendar file. To use this feature, you should set the calendar
  filename option under <b>Elm</b> to be something like
  &quot;~/.reminders.in&quot;, <i>not</i> your main reminder file! This is so
  that any <b>RUN ON</b> commands mailed to you can never be activated.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Then, you can use the <b>Elm</b> <i>scan message for calendar entries</i>
  command to place reminders prefaced by &quot;-&gt;&quot; into .reminders.in.
  In your main .reminders file, include the following lines:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
	RUN OFF   # Disable RUN
	INCLUDE .reminders.in
	RUN ON    # Re-enable RUN
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
In addition, <b>Remind</b> contains a few other security features. It will not
  read a file that is group- or world-writable. It will not run set-uid. If it
  reads a file you don't own, it will disable RUN and the shell() function. And
  if it is run as <i>root</i>, it will only read files owned by <i>root</i>.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="THE_BANNER_COMMAND"><a class="selflink" href="#THE_BANNER_COMMAND">THE
  BANNER COMMAND</a></h1>
When <b>Remind</b> first issues a reminder, it prints a message like this:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
	Reminders for Friday, 30th October, 1992 (today):
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
(The banner is not printed if any of the calendar-producing options is used, or
  if the <b>-k</b> option is used.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>BANNER</b> command lets you change the format. It should appear before
  any <b>REM</b> commands. The format is:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"><b>BANNER</b> <i>format</i></div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <i>format</i> is similar to the <i>body</i> of a <b>REM</b> command. It is
  passed through the substitution filter, with an implicit trigger of the
  current system date. Thus, the default banner is equivalent to:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
	BANNER Reminders for %w, %d%s %m, %y%o:
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can disable the banner completely with BANNER %. Or you can create a custom
  banner:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
	BANNER Hi - here are your reminders for %y-%t-%r:
</pre>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CONTROLLING_THE_OMIT_CONTEXT"><a class="selflink" href="#CONTROLLING_THE_OMIT_CONTEXT">CONTROLLING
  THE OMIT CONTEXT</a></h1>
Sometimes, it is necessary to temporarily change the global <b>OMITs</b> that
  are in force for a few reminders. Three commands allow you to do this:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>PUSH-OMIT-CONTEXT</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This command saves the current global <b>OMITs</b> on an
      internal stack.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>CLEAR-OMIT-CONTEXT</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This command clears all of the global <b>OMITs</b>,
      starting you off with a &quot;clean slate.&quot;</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>POP-OMIT-CONTEXT</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This command restores the global <b>OMITs</b> that were
      saved by the most recent <b>PUSH-OMIT-CONTEXT</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
For example, suppose you have a block of reminders that require a clear
  <b>OMIT</b> context, and that they also introduce unwanted global <b>OMITs</b>
  that could interfere with later reminders. You could use the following
  fragment:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
	PUSH-OMIT-CONTEXT	# Save the current context
	CLEAR-OMIT-CONTEXT	# Clean the slate
	# Block of reminders goes here
	POP-OMIT-CONTEXT	# Restore the saved omit context
</pre>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="EXPRESSIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#EXPRESSIONS">EXPRESSIONS</a></h1>
In certain contexts, to be described later, <b>Remind</b> will accept
  expressions for evaluation. <b>Remind</b> expressions resemble C expressions,
  but operate on different types of objects.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>DATA TYPES</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Remind</b> expressions operate on five types of objects:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>INT</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The <b>INT</b> data type consists of the integers
      representable in one machine word. The <b>INT</b> data type corresponds to
      the C &quot;int&quot; type.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>STRING</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The <b>STRING</b> data type consists of strings of
      characters. It is somewhat comparable to a C character array, but more
      closely resembles the string type in BASIC.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>TIME</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The <b>TIME</b> data type consists of times of the day. The
      <b>TIME</b> data type is internally stored as an integer representing the
      number of minutes since midnight.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>DATE</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The <b>DATE</b> data type consists of dates (later than 1
      January 1990.) Internally, <b>DATE</b> objects are stored as the number of
      days since 1 January 1990.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>DATETIME</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The <b>DATETIME</b> data type consists of a date and time
      together. Internally, <b>DATETIME</b> objects are stored as the number of
      minutes since midnight, 1 January 1990. You can think of a <b>DATETIME</b>
      object as being the combination of <b>DATE</b> and <b>TIME</b> parts.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>CONSTANTS</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The following examples illustrate constants in <b>Remind</b> expressions:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>INT constants</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">12, 36, -10, 0, 1209</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>STRING constants</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">&quot;Hello there&quot;, &quot;This is a test&quot;,
      &quot;\n\gosd\w&quot;, &quot;&quot;</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Note that the empty string is represented by
  &quot;&quot;, and that backslashes in a string are <i>not</i> interpreted
  specially, as in they are in C.</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>TIME constants</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">12:33, 0:01, 14:15, 16:42, 12.16, 13.00, 1.11</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Note that <b>TIME</b> constants are written in
  24-hour format. Either the period or colon can be used to separate the minutes
  from the hours. However, Remind will consistently output times using only one
  separator character. (The output separator character is chosen at
  compile-time.)</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>DATE constants</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>DATE</b> constants are expressed as 'yyyy/mm/dd' or
      'yyyy-mm-dd', and the single quotes <i>must</i> be supplied. This
      distinguishes date constants from division or subtraction of integers.
      Examples:</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">&#x00B4;1993/02/22', '1992-12-25',
  '1999/01/01'
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that <b>DATE</b> values are <i>printed</i> without the quotes. Although
  either '-' or '/' is accepted as a date separator on input, when dates are
  printed, only one will be used. The choice of whether to use '-' or '/' is
  made at compile-time. Note also that versions of <b>Remind</b> prior to
  03.00.01 did not support date constants. In those versions, you must create
  dates using the <b>date()</b> function. Also, versions prior to 03.00.02 did
  not support the '-' date separator.</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>DATETIME constants</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>DATETIME</b> constants are expressed similarly to
      <b>DATE</b> constants with the addition of an &quot;@HH:MM&quot; part. For
      example:</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">&#x00B4;2008-04-05@23:11', '1999/02/03@14:06',
  '2001-04-07@08:30'
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>DATETIME</b> values are printed without the quotes. Notes about date and time
  separator characters for <b>DATE</b> and <b>TIME</b> constants apply also to
  <b>DATETIME</b> constants.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>OPERATORS</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Remind</b> has the following operators. Operators on the same line have equal
  precedence, while operators on lower lines have lower precedence than those on
  higher lines. The operators approximately correspond to C operators.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
	!  -     (unary logical negation and arithmetic negation)
	*  /  %
	+  -
	&lt;  &lt;=  &gt;  &gt;=
	==  !=
	&amp;&amp;
	||
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>DESCRIPTION OF OPERATORS</b>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>!</b></dt>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>&lt;, &lt;=, &gt;, and &gt;=</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">These are the comparison operators. They can take operands
      of any type, but both operands must be of the same type. The comparison
      operators return 1 if the comparison is true, or 0 if it is false. Note
      that string comparison is done following the lexical ordering of
      characters on your system, and that upper and lower case <i>are</i>
      distinct for these operators.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>==, !=</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">== tests for equality, returning 1 if its operands are
      equal, and 0 if they are not. != tests for inequality.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">If the operands are not of the same type, ==
  returns 0 and != returns 1. Again, string comparisons are
  case-sensitive.</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>&amp;&amp;</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This is the logical AND operator. Both of its operands must
      be of type <b>INT</b>. It returns 1 if both operands are non-zero, and 0
      otherwise.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>||</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This is the logical OR operator. Both of its operands must
      be of type <b>INT</b>. It returns 1 if either operand is non-zero, and 0
      otherwise.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>NOTES</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Operators of equal precedence are <i>always</i> evaluated from left to right,
  except where parentheses dictate otherwise. This is important, because the
  enhanced &quot;+&quot; operator is not necessarily associative. For example:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
	1 + 2 + &quot;string&quot; + 3 + 4  yields &quot;3string34&quot;
	1 + (2 + &quot;string&quot;) + (3 + 4)  yields &quot;12string7&quot;
	12:59 + 1 + &quot;test&quot;  yields &quot;13:00test&quot;
	12:59 + (1 + &quot;test&quot;)  yields &quot;12:591test&quot;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The logical operators are <i>not</i> so-called short-circuit operators, as they
  are in C. Both operands are always evaluated. Thus, an expression such as:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
	(f!=0) &amp;&amp; (100/f &lt;= 3)
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
will cause an error if f is zero.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>VARIABLES</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Remind</b> allows you to assign values to variables. The <b>SET</b> command
  is used as follows:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>SET</b> <i>var</i> <i>expr</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Var</i> is the name of a variable. It must start with a letter or underscore,
  and consist only of letters, digits and underscores. Only the first 12
  characters of a variable name are significant. Variable names are <i>not</i>
  case sensitive; thus, &quot;Afoo&quot; and &quot;afOo&quot; are the same
  variable. Examples:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
	SET a 10 + (9*8)
	SET b &quot;This is a test&quot;
	SET mydir getenv(&quot;HOME&quot;)
	SET time 12:15
	SET date today()
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that variables themselves have no type. They take on the type of whatever
  you store in them.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To delete a variable, use the <b>UNSET</b> command:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>UNSET</b> <i>var</i> [<i>var</i>...]
<div class="Pp"></div>
For example, to delete all the variables declared above, use:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
	UNSET a b mydir time date
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>SYSTEM VARIABLES</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
In addition to the regular user variables, <b>Remind</b> has several
  &quot;system variables&quot; that are used to query or control the operating
  state of <b>Remind</b>. System variables are available starting from version
  03.00.07 of <b>Remind</b>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
All system variables begin with a dollar sign '$'. They can be used in
  <b>SET</b> commands and expressions just as regular variables can. All system
  variables always hold values of a specified type. In addition, some system
  variables cannot be modified, and you cannot create new system variables.
  System variables can be initialized on the command line with the <b>-i</b>
  option, but you may need to quote them to avoid having the shell interpret the
  dollar sign. System variable names are not case-sensitive.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The following system variables are defined. Those marked &quot;read-only&quot;
  cannot be changed with the <b>SET</b> command. All system variables hold
  values of type <b>INT</b>, unless otherwise specified.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>$CalcUTC</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If 1 (the default), then <b>Remind</b> uses C library
      functions to calculate the number of minutes between local and Universal
      Time Coordinated. This affects astronomical calculations (
      <b>sunrise()</b> for example.) If 0, then you must supply the number of
      minutes between local and Universal Time Coordinated in the
      <b>$MinsFromUTC</b> system variable.</dd>

  <dt class="It-tag"><b>$DateSep</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This variable can be set only to &quot;/&quot; or

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>$DefaultPrio</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The default priority assigned to reminders without a
      <b>PRIORITY</b> clause. You can set this as required to adjust the
      priorities of blocks of reminders without having to type priorities for
      individual reminders. At startup, <b>$DefaultPrio</b> is set to 5000; it
      can range from 0 to 9999.</dd>

  <dt class="It-tag"><b>$FoldYear</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The standard Unix library functions may have difficulty

      UTC calculations &quot;fold back&quot; years later than 2037 before using
      the Unix library functions. For example, to find out whether or not
      daylight saving time is in effect in June, 2077, the year is &quot;folded
      back&quot; to 2010, because both years begin on a Monday, and both are
      non-leapyears. The rules for daylight saving time are thus presumed to be
      identical for both years, and the Unix library functions can handle 2010.

<b>BUILT-IN FUNCTIONS</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Remind</b> has a plethora of built-in functions. The syntax for a function
  call is the same as in C - the function name, followed a comma-separated list
  of arguments in parentheses. Function names are not case-sensitive. If a
  function takes no arguments, it must be followed by &quot;()&quot; in the
  function call. Otherwise, <b>Remind</b> will interpret it as a variable name,
  and probably not work correctly.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In the descriptions below, short forms are used to denote acceptable types for
  the arguments. The characters &quot;i&quot;, &quot;s&quot;, &quot;d&quot;,
  &quot;t&quot; and &quot;q&quot; denote <b>INT</b>, <b>STRING</b>, <b>DATE</b>,
  <b>TIME</b> and <b>DATETIME</b> arguments, respectively. If an argument can be
  one of several types, the characters are concatenated. For example,
  &quot;di_arg&quot; denotes an argument that can be a <b>DATE</b> or an
  <b>INT</b>. &quot;x_arg&quot; denotes an argument that can be of any type. The
  type of the argument is followed by an underscore and an identifier naming the
  argument.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The built-in functions are:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>abs(i_num)</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Returns the absolute value of <i>num</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>access(s_file, si_mode)</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Tests the access permissions for the file <i>file</i>.
      <i>Mode</i> can be a string, containing a mix of the characters
      &quot;rwx&quot; for read, write and execute permission testing.
      Alternatively, <i>mode</i> can be a number as described in the UNIX
      <b>access</b>(2) system call. The function returns 0 if the file can be
      accessed with the specified <i>mode</i>, and -1 otherwise.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>args(s_fname)</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Returns the number of arguments expected by the
      user-defined function <i>fname</i>, or -1 if no such user-defined function
      exists. Note that this function examines only user-defined functions, not
      built-in functions. Its main use is to determine whether or not a
      particular user-defined function has been defined previously. The
      <b>args()</b> function is available only in versions of <b>Remind</b> from
      03.00.04 and up.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>asc(s_string)</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Returns an <b>INT</b> that is the ASCII code of the first
      character in <i>string</i>. As a special case, <b>asc(&quot;&quot;)</b>
      returns 0.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>baseyr()</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Returns the &quot;base year&quot; that was compiled into
      <b>Remind</b> (normally 1990.) All dates are stored internally as the
      number of days since 1 January of <b>baseyr()</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>char(i_i1 [,i_i2...])</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This function can take any number of <b>INT</b> arguments.
      It returns a <b>STRING</b> consisting of the characters specified by the
      arguments. Note that none of the arguments can be 0, unless there is only
      one argument. As a special case, <b>char(0)</b> returns &quot;&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Note that because <b>Remind</b> does not
  support escaping of characters in strings, the only way to get a double-quote
  in a string is to use <b>char(34)</b>.</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>choose(i_index, x_arg1 [,x_arg2...])</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>Choose</b> must take at least two arguments, the first
      of which is an <b>INT</b>. If <i>index</i> is <i>n</i>, then the
      <i>n</i>th subsequent argument is returned. If <i>index</i> is less than
      1, then <i>arg1</i> is returned. If <i>index</i> is greater than the
      number of subsequent arguments, then the last argument is returned.
      Examples:</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
		 <b>choose(0, &quot;foo&quot;, 1:13, 1000)</b> returns &quot;foo&quot;

		 <b>choose(4, &quot;foo&quot;, 1:13, 1000)</b> returns 1000
</pre>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Note that all arguments to <b>choose()</b> are

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>coerce(s_type, x_arg)</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This function converts <i>arg</i> to the specified
      <i>type</i>, if such conversion is possible. <i>Type</i> must be one of
      &quot;INT&quot;, &quot;STRING&quot;, &quot;DATE&quot;, &quot;TIME&quot; or
      &quot;DATETIME&quot; (case-insensitive). The conversion rules are as

</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="Pp"></div>
If <i>arg</i> is already of the <i>type</i> specified, it is returned unchanged.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If <i>type</i> is &quot;STRING&quot;, then <i>arg</i> is converted to a string
  consisting of its printed representation.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If <i>type</i> is &quot;DATE&quot;, then an <b>INT</b> <i>arg</i> is converted
  by interpreting it as the number of days since 1 January <b>baseyr()</b>. A
  <b>STRING</b> <i>arg</i> is converted by attempting to read it as if it were a
  printed date. A <b>DATETIME</b> is converted to a date by dropping the time
  component. A <b>TIME</b> <i>arg</i> cannot be converted to a date.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If <i>type</i> is &quot;TIME&quot;, then an <b>INT</b> <i>arg</i> is converted
  by interpreting it as the number of minutes since midnight. A <b>STRING</b>
  <i>arg</i> is converted by attempting to read it as if it were a printed time.
  A <b>DATETIME</b> is converted to a time by dropping the date component. A
  <b>DATE</b> <i>arg</i> cannot be converted to a time.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If <i>type</i> is &quot;DATETIME&quot;, then an <b>INT</b> <i>arg</i> is
  converted by interpreting it as the number of minutes since midnight, 1
  January <b>baseyr()</b>. A <b>STRING</b> is converted by attempting to read it
  as if it were a printed datetime. Other types cannot be converted to a
  datetime.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If <i>type</i> is &quot;INT&quot;, then <b>DATE</b>, <b>TIME</b> and
  <b>DATETIME</b> arguments are converted using the reverse of procedures
  described above. A <b>STRING</b> <i>arg</i> is converted by parsing it as an
  integer.</div>

<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="Pp"></div>
Normally, <b>evaltrig</b> finds a trigger date on or after today. If you supply

<div class="Pp"></div>
For example, the expression:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  evaltrig(&quot;Mon 1&quot;, '2008-10-07')
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
returns '2008-11-03', since that is the first date on or after 7 October 2008
  that satisfies &quot;Mon 1&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you want to see how many days it is from the first Monday in October, 2008 to
  the first Monday in November, 2008, use:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  evaltrig(&quot;Mon 1&quot;, '2008-11-01') - evaltrig(&quot;Mon 1&quot;, '2008-10-01')

<div class="Pp"></div>
and the answer is 28. The trigger argument to <b>evaltrig</b> can have all the

<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that <i>end</i> must be greater than or equal to <i>start</i> or an error
  is reported. In addition to using the global OMIT context, you can supply
  additional arguments that are names of weekdays to be omitted. However, in a
  <b>REM</b> command, any local <b>OMITFUNC</b> clause is <i>not</i> taken into
  account by this function.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For example, the following line sets a to 11 (assuming no global OMITs):
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
	set a nonomitted('2007-08-01', '2007-08-16', &quot;Sat&quot;, &quot;Sun&quot;)
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
because Thursday, 16 August 2007 is the 11th working day (not counting Saturday
  and Sunday) after Wednesday, 1 August 2007.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>nonomitted</b> has various uses. For example, many schools run on a six-day
  cycle and the day number is not incremented on holidays. Suppose the school
  year starts with Day 1 on 4 September 2007. The following reminder will label
  day numbers in a calendar:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   IF today() &gt;= '2007-09-04'
       set daynum nonomitted('2007-09-04', today(), &quot;Sat&quot;, &quot;Sun&quot;)
       REM OMIT SAT SUN SKIP CAL Day [(daynum % 6) + 1]
   ENDIF
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Obviously, the answer you get from <b>nonomitted</b> depends on the global OMIT
  context. If you use moveable OMITs, you may get inconsistent results.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Here is a more complex use for <b>nonomitted</b>. My garbage collection follows
  two interleaved 14-day cycles: One Friday, garbage and paper recycling
  (&quot;Black Box&quot;) are collected. The next Friday, garbage and plastic
  recycling (&quot;Blue Box&quot;) are collected. If any of Monday-Friday is a
  holiday, collection is delayed until the Saturday. Here's a way to encode
  these rules:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   fset _garbhol(x) wkdaynum(x) == 5 &amp;&amp; nonomitted(x-4, x+1) &lt; 5
   REM 12 November 1999 *14 AFTER OMITFUNC _garbhol MSG Black Box
   REM 19 November 1999 *14 AFTER OMITFUNC _garbhol MSG Blue Box
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Here's how it works: The _garbhol(x) user-defined function returns 1 if and only
  if (1) <i>x</i> is a Friday and (2) there is at least one OMITted day from the
  previous Monday up to and including the Friday.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The first REM statement sets up the 14-day black-box cycle. The AFTER keyword
  makes it move collection to the Saturday if _garbhol returns 1. The second REM
  statement sets up the 14-day blue-box cycle with a similar adjustment made by
  AFTER in conjunction with _garbhol.</div>

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="EXPRESSION_PASTING"><a class="selflink" href="#EXPRESSION_PASTING">EXPRESSION
  PASTING</a></h1>
An extremely powerful feature of <b>Remind</b> is its macro capability, or
  &quot;expression pasting.&quot;
<div class="Pp"></div>
In almost any situation where <b>Remind</b> is not expecting an expression, you
  can &quot;paste&quot; an expression in. To do this, surround the expression
  with square brackets. For example:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
	REM [mydate] MSG foo
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This evaluates the expression &quot;mydate&quot;, where &quot;mydate&quot; is
  presumably some pre-computed variable, and then &quot;pastes&quot; the result
  into the command-line for the parser to process.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A formal description of this is: When <b>Remind</b> encounters a
  &quot;pasted-in&quot; expression, it evaluates the expression, and coerces the
  result to a <b>STRING</b>. It then substitutes the string for the pasted-in
  expression, and continues parsing. Note, however, that expressions are
  evaluated only once, not recursively. Thus, writing:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
	[&quot;[a+b]&quot;]
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
causes <b>Remind</b> to read the token &quot;[a+b]&quot;. It does not interpret
  this as a pasted-in expression. In fact, the only way to get a literal
  left-bracket into a reminder is to use [&quot;[&quot;].
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can use expression pasting almost anywhere. However, there are a few
  exceptions:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">o</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If <b>Remind</b> is expecting an expression, as in the
      <b>SET</b> command, or the <b>IF</b> command, you should <b>not</b>
      include square brackets. For example, use:</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
		SET a 4+5
</pre>
and not:
<pre>
		SET a [4+5]
</pre>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">o</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">You cannot use expression pasting for the first token on a
      line. For example, the following will not work:</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
		[&quot;SET&quot;] a 1
</pre>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="Pp"></div>
This restriction is because <b>Remind</b> must be able to unambiguously
  determine the first token of a line for the flow-control commands (to be
  discussed later.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
In fact, if <b>Remind</b> cannot determine the first token on a line, it assumes
  that it is a <b>REM</b> command. If expression-pasting is used, <b>Remind</b>
  assumes it is a <b>REM</b> command. Thus, the following three commands are
  equivalent:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
		REM 12 Nov 1993 AT 13:05 MSG BOO!
		12 Nov 1993 AT 13:05 MSG BOO!
		[12] [&quot;Nov &quot; + 1993] AT [12:05+60] MSG BOO!
</pre>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">o</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">You cannot use expression-pasting to determine the type
      (<b>MSG</b>, <b>CAL</b>, etc.) of a <b>REM</b> command. You can paste
      expressions before and after the <b>MSG</b>, etc keywords, but cannot do
      something like this:</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
		REM [&quot;12 Nov 1993 AT 13:05 &quot; + &quot;MSG&quot; + &quot; BOO!&quot;]
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>COMMON PITFALLS IN EXPRESSION PASTING</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Remember, when pasting in expressions, that extra spaces are not inserted. Thus,
  something like:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
	REM[expr]MSG[expr]
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
will probably fail.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you use an expression to calculate a <i>delta</i> or <i>back</i>, ensure that
  the result is a positive number. Something like:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
	REM +[mydelta] Nov 12 1993 MSG foo
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
will fail if <i>mydelta</i> happens to be negative.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="FLOW_CONTROL_COMMANDS"><a class="selflink" href="#FLOW_CONTROL_COMMANDS">FLOW
  CONTROL COMMANDS</a></h1>
<b>Remind</b> has commands that control the flow of a reminder script. Normally,
  reminder scripts are processed sequentially. However, <b>IF</b> and related
  commands allow you to process files conditionally, and skip sections that you
  don't want interpreted.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>THE IF COMMAND</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>IF</b> command has the following form:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
	IF expr
		t-command
		t-command...
	ELSE
		f-command
		f-command...
	ENDIF
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that the commands are shown indented for clarity. Also, the <b>ELSE</b>
  portion can be omitted. <b>IF</b> commands can be nested up to a small limit,
  probably around 8 or 16 levels of nesting, depending on your system.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the <i>expr</i> evaluates to a non-zero <b>INT</b>, or a non-null
  <b>STRING</b>, then the <b>IF</b> portion is considered true, and the
  <i>t-commands</i> are executed. If <i>expr</i> evaluates to zero or null, then
  the <i>f-commands</i> (if the <b>ELSE</b> portion is present) are executed. If
  <i>expr</i> is not of type <b>INT</b> or <b>STRING</b>, then it is an error.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Examples:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
	IF defined(&quot;want_hols&quot;)
		INCLUDE /usr/share/remind/holidays
	ENDIF
<div class="Pp"></div>
	IF today() &gt; '1992/2/10'
		set missed_ap &quot;You missed it!&quot;
	ELSE
		set missed_ap &quot;Still have time...&quot;
	ENDIF
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>THE IFTRIG COMMAND</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>IFTRIG</b> command is similar to an <b>IF</b> command, except that it
  computes a trigger (as in the <b>REM</b> command), and evaluates to true if a
  corresponding <b>REM</b> command would trigger. Examples:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
	IFTRIG 1 Nov
		; Executed on 1 Nov
	ELSE
		; Executed except on 1 Nov
	ENDIF
<div class="Pp"></div>
	IFTRIG 1 -1 OMIT Sat Sun +4
		; Executed on last working day of month,
		; and the 4 working days preceding it
	ELSE
		; Executed except on above days
	ENDIF
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that the <b>IFTRIG</b> command computes a trigger date, which can be
  retrieved with the <b>trigdate()</b> function. You can use all of the normal
  trigger components, such as <b>UNTIL</b>, <i>delta</i>, etc in the
  <b>IFTRIG</b> command.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="USER-DEFINED_FUNCTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#USER-DEFINED_FUNCTIONS">USER-DEFINED
  FUNCTIONS</a></h1>
In addition to the built-in functions, <b>Remind</b> allows you to define your
  own functions. The <b>FSET</b> command does this for you:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>FSET</b> <i>fname</i>(<i>args</i>) <i>expr</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Fname</i> is the name of the function, and follows the convention for naming
  variables. <i>Args</i> is a comma-separated list of arguments, and <i>expr</i>
  is an expression. <i>Args</i> can be empty, in which case you define a
  function taking no parameters. Here are some examples:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
	FSET double(x) 2*x
	FSET yeardiff(date1, date2) year(date1) - year(date2)
	FSET since(x) ord(year(trigdate())-x)
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The last function is useful in birthday reminders. For example:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
	REM 1 Nov +12 MSG Dean's [since(1984)] birthday is %b.
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Dean was born in 1984. The above example, on 1 November 1992, would print:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
	Dean's 8th birthday is today.
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>

The <b>WARN</b> keyword allows precise control over advance warning in a more
  flexible manner than the <i>delta</i> mechanism. It should be followed by the
  name of a user-defined function, <i>warn_function</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If a <i>warn_function</i> is supplied, then it must take one argument of type
  <b>INT</b>. <b>Remind</b> ignores any delta, and instead calls
  <i>warn_function</i> successively with the arguments 1, 2, 3, ...
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Warn_function</i>'s return value <i>n</i> is interpreted as follows:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">o</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If <i>n</i> is positive, then the reminder is triggered

<div class="Pp"></div>
As an example, suppose you wish to be warned of American Independence Day 5, 3,
  and 1 days in advance. You could use this:
<div class="Pp"></div>

</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Similarly to <b>WARN</b>, the <b>SCHED</b> keyword allows precise control over
  the scheduling of timed reminders. It should be followed by the name of a
  user-defined function, <i>sched_function</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If a scheduling function is supplied, then it must take one argument of type
  <b>INT</b>. Rather than using the <b>AT</b> time, time <i>delta</i>, and time
  <i>repeat</i>, <b>Remind</b> calls the scheduling function to determine when
  to trigger the reminder. The first time the reminder is queued, the scheduling
  function is called with an argument of 1. Each time the reminder is triggered,
  it is re-scheduled by calling the scheduling function again. On each call, the
  argument is incremented by one.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The return value of the scheduling function must be an <b>INT</b> or a
  <b>TIME</b>. If the return value is a <b>TIME</b>, then the reminder is
  re-queued to trigger at that time. If it is a positive integer <i>n</i>, then
  the reminder is re-queued to trigger at the previous trigger time plus
  <i>n</i> minutes. Finally, if it is a negative integer or zero, then the
  reminder is re-queued to trigger <i>n</i> minutes before the <b>AT</b> time.
  Note that there must be an <b>AT</b> clause for the <b>SCHED</b> clause to do
  anything.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Here's an example:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
	FSET _sfun(x) choose(x, -60, 30, 15, 10, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0)
	REM AT 13:00 SCHED _sfun MSG foo
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The reminder would first be triggered at 13:00-60 minutes, or at 12:00. It would
  next be triggered 30 minutes later, at 12:30. Then, it would be triggered at
  12:45, 12:55, 12:58, 12:59, 13:00, 13:01 and 13:02.

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="THE_SATISFY_CLAUSE"><a class="selflink" href="#THE_SATISFY_CLAUSE">THE
  SATISFY CLAUSE</a></h1>
The form of <b>REM</b> that uses <b>SATISFY</b> is as follows:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>REM</b> <i>trigger</i> <b>SATISFY</b> <i>expr</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The way this works is as follows: <b>Remind</b> first calculates a trigger date,
  in the normal fashion. Next, it sets <b>trigdate()</b> to the calculated
  trigger date. It then evaluates <i>expr</i>. If the result is not the null
  string or zero, processing ends. Otherwise, <b>Remind</b> computes the next
  trigger date, and re-tests <i>expr</i>. This iteration continues until
  <i>expr</i> evaluates to non-zero or non-null, or until the iteration limit
  specified with the <b>-x</b> command-line option is reached.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If <i>expr</i> is not satisfied, then <b>trigvalid()</b> is set to 0. Otherwise,
  <b>trigvalid()</b> is set to 1. In any event, no error message is issued.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This is really useful only if <i>expr</i> involves a call to the
  <b>trigdate()</b> function; otherwise, <i>expr</i> will not change as
  <b>Remind</b> iterates.
<div class="Pp"></div>
An example of the usefulness of <b>SATISFY</b>: Suppose you wish to be warned of
  every Friday the 13th. Your first attempt may be:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
	# WRONG!
	REM Fri 13 +2 MSG Friday the 13th is %b.
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
But this won't work. This reminder triggers on the first Friday on or after the
  13th of each month. The way to do it is with a more complicated sequence:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
	REM 13 SATISFY wkdaynum(trigdate()) == 5
	IF trigvalid()
		REM [trigdate()] +2 MSG \
		Friday the 13th is %b.
	ENDIF
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Let's see how this works. The <b>SATISFY</b> clause iterates through all the
  13ths of successive months, until a trigger date is found whose day-of-week is
  Friday (== 5). If a valid date was found, we use the calculated trigger date
  to set up the next reminder.
<div class="Pp"></div>
We could also have written:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
	REM Fri SATISFY day(trigdate()) == 13
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
but this would result in more iterations, since &quot;Fridays&quot; occur more
  often than &quot;13ths of the month.&quot;
<div class="Pp"></div>
This technique of using one <b>REM</b> command to calculate a trigger date to be
  used by another command is quite powerful. For example, suppose you wanted to
  OMIT Labour day, which is the first Monday in September. You could use:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
	# Note: SATISFY 1 is an idiom for &quot;do nothing&quot;
	REM Mon 1 Sept SATISFY 1
	OMIT [trigdate()]
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>CAVEAT:</b> This <i>only</i> omits the <i>next</i> Labour Day, not all Labour
  Days in the future. This could cause strange results, as the <b>OMIT</b>
  context can change depending on the current date. For example, if you use the
  following command after the above commands:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
	REM Mon AFTER msg hello
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
the result will not be as you expect. Consider producing a calendar for
  September, 1992. Labour Day was on Monday, 7 September, 1992. However, when
  <b>Remind</b> gets around to calculating the trigger for Tuesday, 8 September,
  1992, the <b>OMIT</b> command will now be omitting Labour Day for 1993, and
  the &quot;Mon AFTER&quot; command will not be triggered. (But see the
  description of <b>SCANFROM</b> in the section &quot;Details about Trigger
  Computation.&quot;)
<div class="Pp"></div>
It is probably best to stay away from computing <b>OMIT</b> trigger dates unless
  you keep these pitfalls in mind.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For versions of <b>Remind</b> starting from 03.00.07, you can include a
  <b>MSG</b>, <b>RUN</b>, etc. clause in a <b>SATISFY</b> clause as follows:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
	REM trigger_stuff SATISFY [expr] MSG body
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that for this case only, the <i>expr</i> after <b>SATISFY</b> <i>must</i>
  be enclosed in braces. It must come after all the other components of the
  trigger, and immediately before the <b>MSG</b>, <b>RUN</b>, etc. keyword. If
  <i>expr</i> cannot be satisfied, then the reminder is not triggered.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Thus, the &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; example can be expressed more compactly
  as:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
	REM 13 +2 SATISFY [wkdaynum(trigdate()) == 5] \
		MSG Friday the 13th is %b.
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
And you can trigger a reminder on Mondays, Wednesdays and Thursdays occurring on
  odd-numbered days of the month with the following:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
	REM Mon Wed Thu SATISFY [day(trigdate())%2] \
		MSG Here it is!!!
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that <b>SATISFY</b> and <b>OMITFUNC</b> can often be used to solve the same
  problem, though in different ways. Sometimes a <b>SATISFY</b> is cleaner and
  sometimes an <b>OMITFUNC</b>; experiment and use whichever seems clearer.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DEBUGGING_REMINDER_SCRIPTS"><a class="selflink" href="#DEBUGGING_REMINDER_SCRIPTS">DEBUGGING
  REMINDER SCRIPTS</a></h1>
Although the command-line <b>-d</b> option is useful for debugging, it is often
  overkill. For example, if you turn on the <b>-dx</b> option for a reminder
  file with many complex expressions, you'll get a huge amount of output. The
  <b>DEBUG</b> command allows you to control the debugging flags under program
  control. The format is:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>DEBUG</b> [+<i>flagson</i>] [-<i>flagsoff</i>]
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Flagson</i> and <i>flagsoff</i> consist of strings of the characters
  &quot;extvlf&quot; that correspond to the debugging options discussed in the
  command-line options section. If preceded with a &quot;+&quot;, the
  corresponding group of debugging options is switched on. Otherwise, they are
  switched off. For example, you could use this sequence to debug a complicated
  expression:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
	DEBUG +x
	set a very_complex_expression(many_args)
	DEBUG -x
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>THE DUMPVARS COMMAND</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The command <b>DUMPVARS</b> displays the values of variables in memory. Its
  format is:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>DUMPVARS</b> [<i>var</i>...]
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you supply a space-separated list of variable names, the corresponding
  variables are displayed. If you do not supply a list of variables, then all
  variables in memory are displayed. To dump a system variable, put its name in
  the list of variables to dump. If you put a lone dollar sign in the list of
  variables to dump, then all system variables will be dumped.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>THE ERRMSG COMMAND</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>ERRMSG</b> command has the following format:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>ERRMSG</b> <i>body</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <i>body</i> is passed through the substitution filter (with an implicit
  trigger date of <b>today()</b>) and printed to the error output stream.
  Example:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
	IF !defined(&quot;critical_var&quot;)
		ERRMSG You must supply a value for &quot;critical_var&quot;
		EXIT
	ENDIF
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>THE EXIT COMMAND</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The above example also shows the use of the <b>EXIT</b> command. This causes an
  unconditional exit from script processing. Any queued timed reminders are
  discarded. If you are in calendar mode (described next), then the calendar
  processing is aborted.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you supply an <b>INT</b>-type expression after the <b>EXIT</b> command, it is
  returned to the calling program as the exit status. Otherwise, an exit status
  of 99 is returned.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>THE FLUSH COMMAND</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This command simply consists of the word <b>FLUSH</b> on a line by itself. The
  command flushes the standard output and standard error streams used by
  <b>Remind</b>. This is not terribly useful to most people, but may be useful
  if you run <b>Remind</b> as a subprocess of another program, and want to use
  pipes for communication.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CALENDAR_MODE"><a class="selflink" href="#CALENDAR_MODE">CALENDAR
  MODE</a></h1>
If you supply the <b>-c</b>, <b>-s</b> or <b>-p</b> command-line option, then
  <b>Remind</b> runs in &quot;calendar mode.&quot; In this mode, <b>Remind</b>
  interprets the script repeatedly, performing one iteration through the whole
  file for each day in the calendar. Reminders that trigger are saved in
  internal buffers, and then inserted into the calendar in the appropriate
  places.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you also supply the <b>-a</b> option, then <b>Remind</b> will not include
  timed reminders in the calendar.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-p</b> option is used in conjunction with the <b>Rem2PS</b> program to
  produce a calendar in PostScript format. For example, the following command
  will send PostScript code to standard output:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
	remind -p .reminders | rem2ps
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can print a PostScript calendar by piping this to the <b>lpr</b> command.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you have a reminder script called &quot;.reminders&quot;, and you execute
  this command:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
	remind -c .reminders jan 1993
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
then <b>Remind</b> executes the script 31 times, once for each day in January.
  Each time it executes the script, it increments the value of <b>today()</b>.
  Any reminders whose trigger date matches <b>today()</b> are entered into the
  calendar.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>MSG</b> and <b>CAL</b>-type reminders, by default, have their entire body
  inserted into the calendar. <b>RUN</b>-type reminders are not normally
  inserted into the calendar. However, if you enclose a portion of the body in
  the %&quot;...%&quot; sequence, only that portion is inserted. For example,
  consider the following:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
	REM 6 Jan MSG %&quot;Dianne's birthday%&quot; is %b
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
In the normal mode, <b>Remind</b> would print &quot;Dianne's birthday is
  today&quot; on 6 January. However, in the calendar mode, only the text
  &quot;Dianne's birthday&quot; is inserted into the box for 6 January.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you explicitly use the %&quot;...%&quot; sequence in a <b>RUN</b>-type
  reminder, then the text between the delimiters is inserted into the calendar.
  If you use the sequence %&quot;%&quot; in a <b>MSG</b> or <b>CAL</b>-type
  reminder, then no calendar entry is produced for that reminder.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>PRESERVING VARIABLES</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Because <b>Remind</b> iterates through the script for each day in the calendar,
  slow operations may severely reduce the speed of producing a calendar.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For example, suppose you set the variables &quot;me&quot; and
  &quot;hostname&quot; as follows:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
	SET me shell(&quot;whoami&quot;)
	SET hostname shell(&quot;hostname&quot;)
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Normally, <b>Remind</b> clears all variables between iterations in calendar
  mode. However, if certain variables are slow to compute, and will not change
  between iterations, you can &quot;preserve&quot; their values with the
  <b>PRESERVE</b> command. Also, since function definitions are preserved
  between calendar iterations, there is no need to redefine them on each
  iteration. Thus, you could use the following sequence:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
	IF ! defined(&quot;initialized&quot;)
		set initialized 1
		set me shell(&quot;whoami&quot;)
		set hostname shell(&quot;hostname&quot;)
		fset func(x) complex_expr
		preserve initialized me hostname
	ENDIF
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The operation is as follows: On the first iteration through the script,
  &quot;initialized&quot; is not defined. Thus, the commands between <b>IF</b>
  and <b>ENDIF</b> are executed. The <b>PRESERVE</b> command ensures that the
  values of initialized, me and hostname are preserved for subsequent
  iterations. On the next iteration, the commands are skipped, since initialized
  has remained defined. Thus, time-consuming operations that do not depend on
  the value of <b>today()</b> are done only once.
<div class="Pp"></div>
System variables (those whose names start with '$') are automatically preserved
  between calendar iterations.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that for efficiency, <b>Remind</b> caches the reminder script (and any
  <b>INCLUDE</b>d files) in memory when producing a calendar.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Timed reminders are sorted and placed into the calendar in time order. These are
  followed by non-timed reminders. <b>Remind</b> automatically places the time
  of timed reminders in the calendar according to the <b>-b</b> command-line
  option. Reminders in calendar mode are sorted as if the <b>-g</b> option had
  been used; you can change the sort order in calendar mode by explicitly using
  the <b>-g</b> option to specify a different order from the default.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>REPEATED EXECUTION</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you supply a <i>repeat</i> parameter on the command line, and do not use the
  <b>-c</b>, <b>-p</b>, or <b>-s</b> options, <b>Remind</b> operates in a
  similar manner to calendar mode. It repeatedly executes the reminder script,
  incrementing <b>today()</b> with each iteration. The same rules about
  preserving variables and function definitions apply. Note that using
  <i>repeat</i> on the command line also enables the <b>-q</b> option and
  disables any <b>-z</b> option. As an example, if you want to see how
  <b>Remind</b> will behave for the next week, you can type:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
	remind .reminders '*7'
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you want to print the dates of the next 1000 days, use:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
	(echo 'banner %'; echo 'msg [today()]%') | remind - '*1000'
</pre>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="INITIALIZING_VARIABLES_ON_THE_COMMAND_LINE"><a class="selflink" href="#INITIALIZING_VARIABLES_ON_THE_COMMAND_LINE">INITIALIZING
  VARIABLES ON THE COMMAND LINE</a></h1>
The <b>-i</b> option is used to initialize variables on the <b>Remind</b>
  command line. The format is <b>-i</b><i>var</i><b>=</b><i>expr</i>, where
  <i>expr</i> is any valid expression. Note that you may have to use quotes or
  escapes to prevent the shell from interpreting special characters in
  <i>expr</i>. You can have as many <b>-i</b> options as you want on the command
  line, and they are processed in order. Thus, if a variable is defined in one
  <b>-i</b> option, it can be referred to by subsequent <b>-i</b> options.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that if you supply a date on the command line, it is not parsed until all
  options have been processed. Thus, if you use <b>today()</b> in any of the
  <b>-i</b> expressions, it will return the same value as <b>realtoday()</b> and
  not the date supplied on the command line.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Any variables defined on the command line are <b>preserved</b> as with the
  <b>PRESERVE</b> command.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You should not have any spaces between the <b>-i</b> option and the equal sign;
  otherwise, strange variable names are created that can only be accessed with
  the <b>value()</b> or <b>defined()</b> functions.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can also define a function on the command line by using:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-i</b><i>func</i>(<i>args</i>)=<i>definition</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Be sure to protect special characters from shell interpretation.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="MORE_ABOUT_POSTSCRIPT"><a class="selflink" href="#MORE_ABOUT_POSTSCRIPT">MORE
  ABOUT POSTSCRIPT</a></h1>
The <b>PS</b> and <b>PSFILE</b> reminders pass PostScript code directly to the
  printer. They differ in that the <b>PS</b>-type reminder passes its body
  directly to the PostScript output (after processing by the substitution
  filter) while the <b>PSFILE</b>-type's body should simply consist of a
  filename. The <b>Rem2PS</b> program will open the file named in the
  <b>PSFILE</b>-type reminder, and include its contents in the PostScript
  output.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The PostScript-type reminders for a particular day are included in the
  PostScript output in sorted order of priority. Note that the order of
  PostScript commands has a <i>major</i> impact on the appearance of the
  calendars. For example, PostScript code to shade a calendar box will
  obliterate code to draw a moon symbol if the moon symbol code is placed in the
  calendar first. For this reason, you should not provide <b>PS</b> or
  <b>PSFILE</b>-type reminders with priorities; instead, you should ensure that
  they appear in the reminder script in the correct order. PostScript code
  should draw objects working from the background to the foreground, so that
  foreground objects properly overlay background ones. If you prioritize these
  reminders and run the script using descending sort order for priorities, the
  PostScript output will not work.
<div class="Pp"></div>
All of the PostScript code for a particular date is enclosed in a
  <b>save</b>-<b>restore</b> pair. However, if several PostScript-type reminders
  are triggered for a single day, each section of PostScript is not enclosed in
  a <b>save</b>-<b>restore</b> pair - instead, the entire body of included
  PostScript is enclosed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
PostScript-type reminders are executed by the PostScript printer before any
  regular calendar entries. Thus, regular calendar entries will overlay the
  PostScript-type reminders, allowing you to create shaded or graphical
  backgrounds for particular days.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Before executing your PostScript code, the origin of the PostScript coordinate
  system is positioned to the bottom left-hand corner of the &quot;box&quot; in
  the calendar representing <b>today()</b>. This location is exactly in the
  middle of the intersection of the bottom and left black lines delineating the
  box - you may have to account for the thickness of these lines when
  calculating positions.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Several PostScript variables are available to the PostScript code you supply.
  All distance and size variables are in PostScript units (1/72 inch.) The
  variables are:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">LineWidth</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The width of the black grid lines making up the
    calendar.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">Border</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The border between the center of the grid lines and the
      space used to print calendar entries. This border is normally blank
    space.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">BoxWidth and BoxHeight</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The width and height of the calendar box, from
      center-to-center of the black gridlines.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">InBoxHeight</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The height from the center of the bottom black gridline to
      the top of the regular calendar entry area. The space from here to the top
      of the box is used only to draw the day number.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">/DayFont, /EntryFont, /SmallFont, /TitleFont and
    /HeadFont</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The fonts used to draw the day numbers, the calendar
      entries, the small calendars, the calendar title (month, year) and the
      day-of-the-week headings, respectively.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">DaySize, EntrySize, TitleSize and HeadSize</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The sizes of the above fonts. (The size of the small
      calendar font is <i>not</i> defined here.) For example, if you wanted to
      print the Hebrew date next to the regular day number in the calendar,
    use:</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
	REM PS Border BoxHeight Border sub DaySize sub moveto \
	   /DayFont findfont DaySize scalefont setfont \
	   ([hebday(today())] [hebmon(today())]) show
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Note how /DayFont and DaySize are used.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that if you supply PostScript code, it is possible to produce invalid
  PostScript files. Always test your PostScript thoroughly with a PostScript
  viewer before sending it to the printer. You should not use any document
  structuring comments in your PostScript code.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DAEMON_MODE"><a class="selflink" href="#DAEMON_MODE">DAEMON
  MODE</a></h1>
If you use the <b>-z</b> command-line option, <b>Remind</b> runs in the
  &quot;daemon&quot; mode. In this mode, no &quot;normal&quot; reminders are
  issued. Instead, only timed reminders are collected and queued, and are then
  issued whenever they reach their trigger time.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In addition, <b>Remind</b> wakes up every few minutes to check the modification
  date on the reminder script (the filename supplied on the command line.) If
  <b>Remind</b> detects that the script has changed, it re-executes itself in
  daemon mode, and interprets the changed script.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In daemon mode, <b>Remind</b> also re-reads the remind script when it detects
  that the system date has changed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In daemon mode, <b>Remind</b> acts as if the <b>-f</b> option had been used, so
  to run in the daemon mode in the background, use:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
	remind -z .reminders &amp;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you use <b>sh</b> or <b>bash</b>, you may have to use the &quot;nohup&quot;
  command to ensure that the daemon is not killed when you log out.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="PURGE_MODE"><a class="selflink" href="#PURGE_MODE">PURGE
  MODE</a></h1>
If you supply the <b>-j</b> command-line option, <b>Remind</b> runs in <i>purge
  mode</i>. In this mode, it tries to purge expired reminders from your reminder
  files.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In purge mode, <b>Remind</b> reads your reminder file and creates a new file by
  appending &quot;.purged&quot; to the original file name. Note that
  <b>Remind</b> <i>never</i> edits your original file; it always creates a new
  .purged file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you invoke <b>Remind</b> against a directory instead of a file, then a
  .purged file is created for each *.rem file in the directory.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Normally, <b>Remind</b> does not create .purged files for INCLUDed files.
  However, if you supply a numeric argument after <b>-j</b>, then <b>Remind</b>
  will create .purged files for the specified level of INCLUDE. For example, if
  you invoke <b>Remind</b> with the argument <b>-j2</b>, then .purged files will
  be created for the file (or directory) specified on the command line, any
  files included by them, and any files included by those files. However,
  .purged files will not be created for third-or-higher level INCLUDE files.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Determining which reminders have expired is extremely tricky. <b>Remind</b> does
  its best, but you should always compare the .purged file to the original file
  and hand-merge the changes back in.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Remind annotates the .purged file as follows:
<div class="Pp"></div>
An expired reminder is prefixed with: #!P: Expired:
<div class="Pp"></div>
In situations where <b>Remind</b> cannot reliably determine that something was
  expired, you may see the following comments inserted before the problematic
  line:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   #!P: Cannot purge SATISFY-type reminders
<div class="Pp"></div>
   #!P: The next IF evaluated false...
   #!P: REM statements in IF block not checked for purging.
<div class="Pp"></div>
   #!P: The previous IF evaluated true.
   #!P: REM statements in ELSE block not checked for purging
<div class="Pp"></div>
   #!P: The next IFTRIG did not trigger.
   #!P: REM statements in IFTRIG block not checked for purging.
<div class="Pp"></div>
   #!P: Next line has expired, but contains expression...  please verify
<div class="Pp"></div>
   #!P: Next line may have expired, but contains non-constant expression
<div class="Pp"></div>
   #!P! Could not parse next line: Some-Error-Message-Here
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Remind</b> always annotates .purged files with lines beginning with
  &quot;#!P&quot;. If such lines are encountered in the <i>original</i> file,
  they are not copied to the .purged file.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SORTING_REMINDERS"><a class="selflink" href="#SORTING_REMINDERS">SORTING
  REMINDERS</a></h1>
The <b>-g</b> option causes <b>Remind</b> to sort reminders by trigger date,
  time and priority before issuing them. Note that reminders are still
  calculated in the order encountered in the script. However, rather than being
  issued immediately, they are saved in an internal buffer. When <b>Remind</b>
  has finished processing the script, it issues the saved reminders in sorted
  order. The <b>-g</b> option can be followed by up to four characters that must
  all be &quot;a&quot; or &quot;d&quot;. The first character specifies the sort
  order by trigger date (ascending or descending), the second specifies the sort
  order by trigger time and the third specifies the sort order by priority. If
  the fourth character is &quot;d&quot;, the untimed reminders are sorted before
  timed reminders. The default is to sort all fields in ascending order and to
  sort untimed reminders after timed reminders.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In ascending order, reminders are issued with the most imminent first.
  Descending order is the reverse. Reminders are always sorted by trigger date,
  and reminders with the same trigger date are then sorted by trigger time. If
  two reminders have the same date and time, then the priority is used to break
  ties. Reminders with the same date, time and priority are issued in the order
  they were encountered.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can define a user-defined function called SORTBANNER that takes one
  <b>DATE</b>-type argument. In sort mode, the following sequence happens:
<div class="Pp"></div>
If <b>Remind</b> notices that the next reminder to issue has a different trigger
  date from the previous one (or if it is the first one to be issued), then
  SORTBANNER is called with the trigger date as its argument. The result is
  coerced to a string, and passed through the substitution filter with the
  appropriate trigger date. The result is then displayed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Here's an example - consider the following fragment:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
	# Switch off the normal banner
	BANNER %
	REM 11 March 1993 ++1 MSG Not so important
	REM 17 March 1993 ++7 MSG Way in the future
	REM 10 March 1993 MSG Important Reminder
	REM 11 March 1993 ++1 MSG Not so important - B
	FSET sortbanner(x) iif(x == today(), \
		&quot;***** THINGS TO DO TODAY *****&quot;, \
		&quot;----- Things to do %b -----&quot;)
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Running this with the <b>-gaa</b> option on 10 March 1993 produces the following
  output:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
	***** THINGS TO DO TODAY *****
<div class="Pp"></div>
	Important Reminder
<div class="Pp"></div>
	----- Things to do tomorrow -----
<div class="Pp"></div>
	Not so important
<div class="Pp"></div>
	Not so important - B
<div class="Pp"></div>
	----- Things to do in 7 days' time -----
<div class="Pp"></div>
	Way in the future
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can use the <b>args()</b> built-in function to determine whether or not
  SORTBANNER has been defined. (This could be used, for example, to provide a
  default definition for SORTBANNER in a system-wide file included at the end of
  the user's file.) Here's an example:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
	# Create a default sortbanner function if it hasn't already
	# been defined
	if args(&quot;sortbanner&quot;) != 1
		fset sortbanner(x) &quot;--- Things to do %b ---&quot;
	endif
</pre>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="MSGPREFIX()_AND_MSGSUFFIX()"><a class="selflink" href="#MSGPREFIX()_AND_MSGSUFFIX()">MSGPREFIX()
  AND MSGSUFFIX()</a></h1>
You can define two functions in your script called <b>msgprefix()</b> and
  <b>msgsuffix()</b>. They should each accept one argument, a number from 0 to
  9999.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In normal mode, for <b>MSG</b>- and <b>MSF</b>-type reminders, the following
  sequence occurs when <b>Remind</b> triggers a reminder:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">o</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If <b>msgprefix()</b> is defined, it is evaluated with the
      priority of the reminder as its argument. The result is printed. It is
      <i>not</i> passed through the substitution filter.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">o</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The body of the reminder is printed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">o</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If <b>msgsuffix()</b> is defined, it is evaluated with the
      priority of the reminder as its argument. The result is printed. It is
      <i>not</i> passed through the substitution filter.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Here's an example: The following definition causes priority-0 reminders to be
  preceded by &quot;URGENT&quot;, and priority-6000 reminders to be preceded by
  &quot;(not important)&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
	fset msgprefix(x) iif(x==0, &quot;URGENT: &quot;, \
	     x==6000, &quot;(not important) &quot;, &quot;&quot;)
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
In Calendar Mode (with the <b>-c</b>, <b>-s</b> or <b>-p</b> options), an
  analogous pair of functions named <b>calprefix()</b> and <b>calsuffix()</b>
  can be defined. They work with all reminders that produce an entry in the
  calendar (i.e., <b>CAL</b>- and possibly <b>RUN</b>-type reminders as well as
  <b>MSG</b>-type reminders.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>NOTES</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Normally, the body of a reminder is followed by a carriage return. Thus, the
  results of <b>msgsuffix()</b> will appear on the next line. If you don't want
  this, end the body of the reminder with a percentage sign, &quot;%&quot;. If
  you want a space between your reminders, simply include a carriage return (
  <b>char(13)</b>) as part of the <b>msgsuffix()</b> return value.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If <b>Remind</b> has problems evaluating <b>msgprefix()</b>, <b>msgsuffix()</b>
  or <b>sortbanner()</b>, you will see a lot of error messages. For an example
  of this, define the following:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
	fset msgprefix(x) x/0
</pre>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="FOREIGN_LANGUAGE_SUPPORT"><a class="selflink" href="#FOREIGN_LANGUAGE_SUPPORT">FOREIGN
  LANGUAGE SUPPORT</a></h1>
Your version of <b>Remind</b> may have been compiled to support a language other
  than English. This support may or may not be complete - for example, all error
  and usage messages may still be in English. However, at a minimum,
  foreign-language versions of <b>Remind</b> will output names of months and
  weekdays in the foreign language. Also, the substitution mechanism will
  substitute constructs suitable for the foreign language rather than for
  English.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A foreign-language version of <b>Remind</b> will accept either the English or
  foreign-language names of weekdays and months in a reminder script. However,
  for compatibility between versions of <b>Remind</b>, you should use only the
  English names in your scripts. Also, if your C compiler or run-time libraries
  are not &quot;8-bit clean&quot; or don't understand the ISO-Latin character
  set, month or day names with accented letters may not be recognized.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="THE_HEBREW_CALENDAR"><a class="selflink" href="#THE_HEBREW_CALENDAR">THE
  HEBREW CALENDAR</a></h1>
<b>Remind</b> has support for the Hebrew calendar, which is a luni-solar
  calendar. This allows you to create reminders for Jewish holidays, jahrzeits
  (anniversaries of deaths) and smachot (joyous occasions.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>THE HEBREW YEAR</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The Hebrew year has 12 months, alternately 30 and 29 days long. The months are:
  Tishrey, Heshvan, Kislev, Tevet, Shvat, Adar, Nisan, Iyar, Sivan, Tamuz, Av
  and Elul. In Biblical times, the year started in Nisan, but Rosh Hashana
  (Jewish New Year) is now celebrated on the 1st and 2nd of Tishrey.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In a cycle of 19 years, there are 7 leap years, being years 3, 6, 8, 11, 14, 17
  and 19 of the cycle. In a leap year, an extra month of 30 days is added before
  Adar. The two Adars are called Adar A and Adar B.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For certain religious reasons, the year cannot start on a Sunday, Wednesday or
  Friday. To adjust for this, a day is taken off Kislev or added to Heshvan.
  Thus, a regular year can have from 353 to 355 days, and a leap year from 383
  to 385.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When Kislev or Heshvan is short, it is called <i>chaser</i>, or lacking. When it
  is long, it is called <i>shalem</i>, or full.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The Jewish date changes at sunset. However, <b>Remind</b> will change the date
  at midnight, not sunset. So in the period between sunset and midnight, Remind
  will be a day earlier than the true Jewish date. This should not be much of a
  problem in practice.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The computations for the Jewish calendar were based on the program
  &quot;hdate&quot; written by Amos Shapir of the Hebrew University of
  Jerusalem, Israel. He also supplied the preceding explanation of the calendar.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>HEBREW DATE FUNCTIONS</b>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>hebday(d_date)</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Returns the day of the Hebrew month corresponding to the
      <i>date</i> parameter. For example, 12 April 1993 corresponds to 21 Nisan
      5753. Thus, hebday('1993/04/12') returns 21.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>hebmon(d_date)</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Returns the name of the Hebrew month corresponding to
      <i>date</i>. For example, hebmon('1993/04/12') returns
    &quot;Nisan&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>hebyear(d_date)</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Returns the Hebrew year corresponding to <i>date</i>. For
      example, hebyear('1993/04/12') returns 5753.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>hebdate(i_day, s_hebmon [,id_yrstart [,i_jahr
    [,i_aflag]]])</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The <b>hebdate()</b> function is the most complex of the
      Hebrew support functions. It can take from 2 to 5 arguments. It returns a
      <b>DATE</b> corresponding to the Hebrew date.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">The <i>day</i> parameter can range from 1 to
  30, and specifies the day of the Hebrew month. The <i>hebmon</i> parameter is
  a string that must name one of the Hebrew months specified above. Note that
  the month must be spelled out in full, and use the English transliteration
  shown previously. You can also specify &quot;Adar A&quot; and &quot;Adar
  B.&quot; Month names are not case-sensitive.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <i>yrstart</i> parameter can either be a <b>DATE</b> or an <b>INT</b>. If it
  is a <b>DATE</b>, then the <b>hebdate()</b> scans for the first Hebrew date on
  or after that date. For example:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
		hebdate(15, &quot;Nisan&quot;, '1990/01/01')
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
returns 1990/03/30, because that is the first occurrence of 15 Nisan on or after
  1 January 1990.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If <i>yrstart</i> is an <b>INT</b>, it is interpreted as a Hebrew year. Thus:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
		hebdate(22, &quot;Kislev&quot;, 5756)
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
returns 1995/12/15, because that date corresponds to 22 Kislev, 5756. Note that
  none of the Hebrew date functions will work with dates outside <b>Remind's</b>
  normal range for dates.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If <i>yrstart</i> is not supplied, it defaults to <b>today()</b>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <i>jahr</i> modifies the behaviour of <b>hebdate()</b> as follows:
<div class="Pp"></div>
If <i>jahr</i> is 0 (the default), then <b>hebdate()</b> keeps scanning until it
  finds a date that exactly satisfies the other parameters. For example:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
		hebdate(30, &quot;Adar A&quot;, 1993/01/01)
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
returns 1995/03/02, corresponding to 30 Adar A, 5755, because that is the next
  occurrence of 30 Adar A after 1 January, 1993. This behaviour is appropriate
  for Purim Katan, which only appears in leap years.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If <i>jahr</i> is 1, then the date is modified as follows:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">o</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">30 Heshvan is converted to 1 Kislev in years when Heshvan
      is <i>chaser</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">o</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">30 Kislev is converted to 1 Tevet in years when Kislev is
      <i>chaser</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">o</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">30 Adar A is converted to 1 Nisan in non-leapyears</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">o</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Other dates in Adar A are moved to the corresponding day in
      Adar in non-leapyears</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This behaviour is appropriate for smachot (joyous occasions) and for some
  jahrzeits - see &quot;JAHRZEITS.&quot;
<div class="Pp"></div>
if <i>jahr</i> is 2, then the date is modified as follows:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">o</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">30 Kislev and 30 Heshvan are converted to 29 Kislev and 29
      Heshvan, respectively, if the month is <i>chaser</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">o</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">30 Adar A is converted to 30 Shvat in non-leapyears</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">o</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Other dates in Adar A are moved to the corresponding day in
      Adar in non-leapyears</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
if <i>jahr</i> is not 0, 1, or 2, it is interpreted as a Hebrew year, and the
  behaviour is calculated as described in the next section,
  &quot;JAHRZEITS.&quot;
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <i>aflag</i> parameter modifies the behaviour of the function for dates in
  Adar during leap years. The <i>aflag</i> is <i>only</i> used if <i>yrstart</i>
  is a <b>DATE</b> type.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <i>aflag</i> only affects date calculations if <i>hebmon</i> is specified as
  &quot;Adar&quot;. In leap years, the following algorithm is followed:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">o</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If <i>aflag</i> is 0, then the date is triggered in Adar B.
      This is the default.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">o</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If <i>aflag</i> is 1, then the date is triggered in Adar A.
      This may be appropriate for jahrzeits in the Ashkenazi tradition; consult
      a rabbi.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">o</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If <i>aflag</i> is 2, then the date is triggered in both
      Adar A and Adar B of a leap year. Some Ashkenazim perform jahrzeit in both
      Adar A and Adar B.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>JAHRZEITS</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
A jahrzeit is a yearly commemoration of someone's death. It normally takes place
  on the anniversary of the death, but may be delayed if burial is delayed -
  consult a rabbi for more information.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In addition, because some months change length, it is not obvious which day the
  anniversary of a death is. The following rules are used:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">o</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If the death occurred on 30 Heshvan, and Heshvan in the
      year after the death is <i>chaser</i>, then the jahrzeit is observed on 29
      Heshvan in years when Heshvan is <i>chaser</i>. Otherwise, the yahrzeit is
      observed on 1 Kislev when Heshvan is <i>chaser</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">o</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If the death occurred on 30 Kislev, and Kislev in the year
      after the death is <i>chaser</i>, then the jahrzeit is observed on 29
      Kislev in years when Kislev is <i>chaser</i>. Otherwise, the yahrzeit is
      observed on 1 Tevet when Kislev is <i>chaser</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">o</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If the death occurred on 1-29 Adar A, it is observed on
      1-29 Adar in non-leapyears.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">o</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If the death occurred on 30 Adar A, it is observed on 30
      Shvat in a non-leapyear.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Specifying a Hebrew year for the <i>jahr</i> parameter causes the correct
  behaviour to be selected for a death in that year. You may also have to
  specify <i>aflag</i>, depending on your tradition.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The jahrzeit information was supplied by Frank Yellin, who quoted &quot;The
  Comprehensive Hebrew Calendar&quot; by Arthur Spier, and &quot;Calendrical
  Calculations&quot; by E. M. Reingold and Nachum Dershowitz.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OUT-OF-BAND_REMINDERS"><a class="selflink" href="#OUT-OF-BAND_REMINDERS">OUT-OF-BAND
  REMINDERS</a></h1>
The <b>SPECIAL</b> keyword is used to transmit &quot;out-of-band&quot;
  information to <b>Remind</b> backends, such as <b>tkremind</b> or
  <b>Rem2PS</b>. They are used only when piping data from a <b>remind -p</b>
  line. (Note that the COLOR special is an exception; it downgrades to the
  equivalent of MSG in <b>remind's</b> normal mode of operation.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
The various <b>SPECIAL</b>s recognized are particular for each backend; however,
  there are three <b>SPECIAL</b>s that all backends should attempt to support.
  They are currently supported by <b>Rem2PS</b>, <b>tkremind</b> and
  <b>rem2html</b>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>SHADE</b> special replaces the <b>psshade()</b> function. Use it like
  this:
<pre>
	REM Sat Sun SPECIAL SHADE 128
	REM Mon SPECIAL SHADE 255 0 0
</pre>
The <b>SHADE</b> keyword is followed by either one or three numbers, from 0 to
  255. If one number is supplied, it is interpreted as a grey-scale value from
  black (0) to white (255). If three numbers are supplied, they are interpreted
  as RGB components from minimum (0) to maximum (255). The example above shades
  weekends a fairly dark grey and makes Mondays a fully-saturated red. (These
  shadings appear in calendars produced by <b>Rem2PS</b>, <b>tkremind</b> and
  <b>rem2html</b>.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>MOON</b> special replaces the <b>psmoon()</b> function. Use it like this:
<pre>
	REM [moondate(0)] SPECIAL MOON 0
	REM [moondate(1)] SPECIAL MOON 1
	REM [moondate(2)] SPECIAL MOON 2
	REM [moondate(3)] SPECIAL MOON 3
</pre>
These draw little moons on the various calendars. The complete syntax of the
  <b>MOON</b> special is as follows:
<pre>
	... SPECIAL MOON phase moonsize fontsize msg
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Phase</i> is a number from 0 to 3, with 0 representing a new moon, 1 the
  first quarter, 2 a full moon and 3 the last quarter.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>moonsize</i> is the diameter in PostScript units of the moon to draw. If
  omitted or supplied as -1, the backend chooses an appropriate size.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>fontsize</i> is the font size in PostScript units of the <i>msg</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Msg</i> is additional text that is placed near the moon glyph.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that only the <b>Rem2PS</b> backend supports <i>moonsize</i> and
  <i>fontsize</i>; the other backends use fixed sizes.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>COLOR</b> special lets you place colored reminders in the calendar. Use
  it like this:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
	REM ... SPECIAL COLOR 255 0 0 This is a bright red reminder
	REM ... SPECIAL COLOR 0 128 0 This is a dark green reminder
</pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
You can spell COLOR either the American way (&quot;COLOR&quot;) or the British
  way (&quot;COLOUR&quot;). This manual will use the American way.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Immediately following COLOR should be three decimal numbers ranging from 0 to
  255 specifying red, green and blue intensities, respectively. The rest of the
  line is the text to put in the calendar.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The COLOR special is &quot;doubly special&quot;, because in its normal operating
  mode, <b>remind</b> treats a COLOR special just like a MSG-type reminder.
  Also, if you invoke <b>Remind</b> with <b>-cc</b>..., then it approximates
  SPECIAL COLOR reminders on your terminal.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>WEEK</b> special lets you place annotations such as the week number in
  the calendar. For example, this would number each Monday with the ISO 8601
  week number. The week number is shown like this: &quot;(W <i>n</i>)&quot; in
  this example, but you can put whatever text you like after the WEEK keyword.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
	REM Monday SPECIAL WEEK (W[weekno()])
</pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>

<b>NIFTY EXAMPLES</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This section is a sampling of what you can do with <b>Remind</b>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
	REM 5 Feb 1991 AT 14:00 +45 *30 \
	RUN mail -s &quot;Meeting at %2&quot; $LOGNAME &lt;/dev/null &amp;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
On 5 February, 1991, this reminder will mail you reminders of a 2:00pm meeting
  at 1:15, 1:45 and 2:00. The subject of the mail message will be &quot;Meeting
  at 2:00pm&quot; and the body of the message will be blank.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
	REM AT 17:00 RUN echo &quot;5:00pm - GO HOME!&quot; | xless -g +0+0 &amp;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This reminder will pop up an xless window at 5:00pm every day. The xless window
  will contain the line &quot;5:00pm - GO HOME!&quot;
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
	REM AT 23:59 RUN (sleep 120; remind -a [filename()]) &amp;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This reminder will run at one minute to midnight. It will cause a new
  <b>Remind</b> process to start at one minute past midnight. This allows you to
  have a continuous reminder service so you can work through the night and still
  get timed reminders for early in the morning. Note that this trick is no
  longer necessary, providing you run <b>Remind</b> in daemon mode.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
	remind -c12 /dev/null Jan 1993
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This invocation of <b>Remind</b> will cause it to print a calendar for 1993,
  with all entries left blank.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
	REM CAL [trigdate()-date(year(trigdate()), 1, 1)+1]
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This example puts an entry in each box of a calendar showing the number (1-365
  or 366) of the day of the year.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
	REM Tue 2 Nov SATISFY (year(trigdate())%4) == 0
	IF trigvalid()
		REM [trigdate()] ++5 MSG \
		U.S. Presidential Election!!
	ENDIF
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This example warns you 5 days ahead of each American presidential election. The
  first <b>REM</b> command calculates the first Tuesday after the first Monday
  in November. (This is equivalent to the first Tuesday on or after 2 November.)
  The <b>SATISFY</b> clause ensures that the trigger date is issued only in
  election years, which are multiples of 4. The second <b>REM</b> command
  actually issues the reminder.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>DETAILS ABOUT TRIGGER COMPUTATION</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Here is a <i>conceptual</i> description of how triggers are calculated. Note
  that <b>Remind</b> actually uses a much more efficient procedure, but the
  results are the same as if the conceptual procedure had been followed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Remind</b> starts from the current date (that is, the value of
  <b>today()</b>) and scans forward, examining each day one at a time until it
  finds a date that satisfies the trigger, or can prove that no such dates (on
  or later than <b>today()</b>) exist.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If <b>Remind</b> is executing a <b>SATISFY</b>-type reminder, it evaluates the
  expression with <b>trigdate()</b> set to the date found above. If the
  expression evaluates to zero or the null string, <b>Remind</b> continues the
  scanning procedure described above, starting with the day after the trigger
  found above.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>SCANFROM</b> clause (having a syntax similar to <b>UNTIL</b>) can modify
  the search strategy used. In this case, <b>Remind</b> begins the scanning
  procedure at <i>scan_date</i>, which is the date specified in the
  <b>SCANFROM</b> clause. For example:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
	REM Mon 1 SCANFROM 17 Jan 1992 MSG Foo
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The example above will always have a trigger date of Monday, 3 February 1992.
  That is because <b>Remind</b> starts scanning from 17 January 1992, and stops
  scanning as soon as it hits a date that satisfies &quot;Mon 1.&quot;
<div class="Pp"></div>
The main use of <b>SCANFROM</b> is in situations where you want to calculate the
  positions of floating holidays. Consider the Labour Day example shown much
  earlier. Labour Day is the first Monday in September. It can move over a range
  of 7 days. Consider the following sequence:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
	REM Mon 1 Sept SCANFROM [today()-7] SATISFY 1
	OMIT [trigdate()]
<div class="Pp"></div>
	REM Mon AFTER MSG Hello
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>SCANFROM</b> clause makes sure that <b>Remind</b> begins scanning from 7
  days before the current date. This ensures that Labour Day for the current
  year will continue to be triggered until 7 days after it has occurred. This
  allows you to safely use the AFTER keyword as shown.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In general, use <b>SCANFROM</b> as shown for safe movable <b>OMITs</b>. The
  amount you should scan back by (7 days in the example above) depends on the
  number of possible consecutive <b>OMITted</b> days that may occur, and on the
  range of the movable holiday. Generally, a value of 7 is safe.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>FROM</b> clause operates almost like the counterpoint to <b>UNTIL</b>. It
  prevents the reminder from triggering before the <b>FROM</b> date. For
  example, the following reminder:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
	REM Mon Thu FROM 23 Jul 2007 UNTIL 2 Aug 2007 MSG Test
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
will trigger on Mondays and Thursdays between 23 July 2007 and 2 August 2007
  inclusive.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>FROM</b> is really just syntactic sugar; you could implement the reminder
  above as follows:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
	REM Mon Thu SCANFROM [max(today(), '2007-07-23')] \
            UNTIL 2 Aug 2007 MSG Test
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
but that's a lot harder to read. Internally, <b>Remind</b> treats <b>FROM</b>
  exactly as illustrated using <b>SCANFROM</b>. For that reason, you cannot use
  both <b>FROM</b> and <b>SCANFROM</b>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that if you use one <b>REM</b> command to calculate a trigger date, perform
  date calculations (addition or subtraction, for example) and then use the
  modified date in a subsequent <b>REM</b> command, the results <i>may not be
  what you intended.</i> This is because you have circumvented the normal
  scanning mechanism. You should try to write <b>REM</b> commands that compute
  trigger dates that can be used unmodified in subsequent <b>REM</b> commands.
  The file &quot;defs.rem&quot; that comes with the <b>Remind</b> distribution
  contains examples.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>DETAILS ABOUT TRIGVALID()</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>trigvalid()</b> function returns 1 if <b>Remind</b> could find a trigger
  date for the previous <b>REM</b> or <b>IFTRIG</b> command. More specifically,
  it returns 1 if <b>Remind</b> finds a date <i>not before the starting</i>
  <i>date of the scanning</i> that satisfies the trigger. In addition, there is
  one special case in which <b>trigvalid()</b> returns 1 and <b>trigdate()</b>
  returns a meaningful result:
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the <b>REM</b> or <b>IFTRIG</b> command did not contain an <b>UNTIL</b>
  clause, and contained all of the <i>day</i>, <i>month</i> and <i>year</i>
  components, then <b>Remind</b> will correctly compute a trigger date, even if

Remind is now supported by Roaring Penguin Software Inc.
  (http://www.roaringpenguin.com)

Dianne Skoll &lt;dfs@roaringpenguin.com&gt; wrote <b>Remind</b>. The moon code
  was copied largely unmodified from &quot;moontool&quot; by John Walker. The
  sunrise and sunset functions use ideas from programs by Michael Schwartz and
  Marc T. Kaufman. The Hebrew calendar support was taken from &quot;hdate&quot;
  by Amos Shapir. OS/2 support was done by Darrel Hankerson, Russ Herman, and
  Norman Walsh. The supported foreign languages and their translators are listed
  below. Languages marked &quot;complete&quot; support error messages and usage
  instructions in that language; all others only support the substitution filter
  mechanism and month/day names.

There's no good reason why read-only system variables are not implemented as
  functions, or why functions like <b>version()</b>, etc. are not implemented as
  read-only system variables.

Hebrew dates in <b>Remind</b> change at midnight instead of sunset.

Language should be selectable at run-time, not compile-time. Don't expect this
  to happen soon!
