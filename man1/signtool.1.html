The Signing Tool, <b>signtool</b>, creates digital signatures and uses a Java
  Archive (JAR) file to associate the signatures with files in a directory.
  Electronic software distribution over any network involves potential security
  problems. To help address some of these problems, you can associate digital
  signatures with the files in a JAR archive. Digital signatures allow
  SSL-enabled clients to perform two important operations:
<div class="Pp"></div>
* Confirm the identity of the individual, company, or other entity whose digital
  signature is associated with the files
<div class="Pp"></div>
* Check whether the files have been tampered with since being signed
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you have a signing certificate, you can use Netscape Signing Tool to
  digitally sign files and package them as a JAR file. An object-signing
  certificate is a special kind of certificate that allows you to associate your
  digital signature with one or more files.
<div class="Pp"></div>
An individual file can potentially be signed with multiple digital signatures.
  For example, a commercial software developer might sign the files that
  constitute a software product to prove that the files are indeed from a
  particular company. A network administrator manager might sign the same files
  with an additional digital signature based on a company-generated certificate
  to indicate that the product is approved for use within the company.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The significance of a digital signature is comparable to the significance of a
  handwritten signature. Once you have signed a file, it is difficult to claim
  later that you didn't sign it. In some situations, a digital signature may be
  considered as legally binding as a handwritten signature. Therefore, you
  should take great care to ensure that you can stand behind any file you sign
  and distribute.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For example, if you are a software developer, you should test your code to make
  sure it is virus-free before signing it. Similarly, if you are a network
  administrator, you should make sure, before signing any code, that it comes
  from a reliable source and will run correctly with the software installed on
  the machines to which you are distributing it.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Before you can use Netscape Signing Tool to sign files, you must have an
  object-signing certificate, which is a special certificate whose associated
  private key is used to create digital signatures. For testing purposes only,
  you can create an object-signing certificate with Netscape Signing Tool 1.3.
  When testing is finished and you are ready to disitribute your software, you
  should obtain an object-signing certificate from one of two kinds of sources:
<div class="Pp"></div>
* An independent certificate authority (CA) that authenticates your identity and
  charges you a fee. You typically get a certificate from an independent CA if
  you want to sign software that will be distributed over the Internet.
<div class="Pp"></div>
* CA server software running on your corporate intranet or extranet. Netscape
  Certificate Management System provides a complete management solution for
  creating, deploying, and managing certificates, including CAs that issue
  object-signing certificates.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You must also have a certificate for the CA that issues your signing certificate
  before you can sign files. If the certificate authority's certificate isn't
  already installed in your copy of Communicator, you typically install it by
  clicking the appropriate link on the certificate authority's web site, for
  example on the page from which you initiated enrollment for your signing
  certificate. This is the case for some test certificates, as well as
  certificates issued by Netscape Certificate Management System: you must
  download the the CA certificate in addition to obtaining your own signing
  certificate. CA certificates for several certificate authorities are
  preinstalled in the Communicator certificate database.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When you receive an object-signing certificate for your own use, it is
  automatically installed in your copy of the Communicator client software.
  Communicator supports the public-key cryptography standard known as PKCS #12,
  which governs key portability. You can, for example, move an object-signing
  certificate and its associated private key from one computer to another on a
  credit-card-sized device called a smart card.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
-b basename
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Specifies the base filename for the .rsa and
  .sf files in the META-INF directory to conform with the JAR format. For
  example, <i>-b signatures</i> causes the files to be named signatures.rsa and
  signatures.sf. The default is signtool.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-c#
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Specifies the compression level for the -J or
  -Z option. The symbol # represents a number from 0 to 9, where 0 means no
  compression and 9 means maximum compression. The higher the level of
  compression, the smaller the output but the longer the operation takes. If the
  -c# option is not used with either the -J or the -Z option, the default
  compression value used by both the -J and -Z options is 6.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-d certdir
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Specifies your certificate database directory;
  that is, the directory in which you placed your key3.db and cert7.db files. To
  specify the current directory, use &quot;-d.&quot; (including the period). The
  Unix version of signtool assumes ~/.netscape unless told otherwise. The NT
  version of signtool always requires the use of the -d option to specify where
  the database files are located.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-e extension
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Tells signtool to sign only files with the
  given extension; for example, use -e&quot;.class&quot; to sign only Java class
  files. Note that with Netscape Signing Tool version 1.1 and later this option
  can appear multiple times on one command line, making it possible to specify
  multiple file types or classes to include.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-f commandfile
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Specifies a text file containing Netscape
  Signing Tool options and arguments in keyword=value format. All options and
  arguments can be expressed through this file. For more information about the
  syntax used with this file, see &quot;Tips and Techniques&quot;.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-G nickname
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Generates a new private-public key pair and
  corresponding object-signing certificate with the given nickname. The newly
  generated keys and certificate are installed into the key and certificate
  databases in the directory specified by the -d option. With the NT version of
  Netscape Signing Tool, you must use the -d option with the -G option. With the
  Unix version of Netscape Signing Tool, omitting the -d option causes the tool
  to install the keys and certificate in the Communicator key and certificate
  databases. If you are installing the keys and certificate in the Communicator
  databases, you must exit Communicator before using this option; otherwise, you
  risk corrupting the databases. In all cases, the certificate is also output to
  a file named x509.cacert, which has the MIME-type application/x-x509-ca-cert.
  Unlike certificates normally used to sign finished code to be distributed over
  a network, a test certificate created with -G is not signed by a recognized
  certificate authority. Instead, it is self-signed. In addition, a single test
  signing certificate functions as both an object-signing certificate and a CA.
  When you are using it to sign objects, it behaves like an object-signing
  certificate. When it is imported into browser software such as Communicator,
  it behaves like an object-signing CA and cannot be used to sign objects. The
  -G option is available in Netscape Signing Tool 1.0 and later versions only.
  By default, it produces only RSA certificates with 1024-byte keys in the
  internal token. However, you can use the -s option specify the required key
  size and the -t option to specify the token.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-i scriptname
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Specifies the name of an installer script for
  SmartUpdate. This script installs files from the JAR archive in the local
  system after SmartUpdate has validated the digital signature. For more
  details, see the description of -m that follows. The -i option provides a
  straightforward way to provide this information if you don't need to specify
  any metadata other than an installer script.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-J
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Signs a directory of HTML files containing
  JavaScript and creates as many archive files as are specified in the HTML
  tags. Even if signtool creates more than one archive file, you need to supply
  the key database password only once. The -J option is available only in
  Netscape Signing Tool 1.0 and later versions. The -J option cannot be used at
  the same time as the -Z option. If the -c# option is not used with the -J
  option, the default compression value is 6. Note that versions 1.1 and later
  of Netscape Signing Tool correctly recognizes the CODEBASE attribute, allows
  paths to be expressed for the CLASS and SRC attributes instead of filenames
  only, processes LINK tags and parses HTML correctly, and offers clearer error
  messages.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-j directory
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Specifies a special JavaScript directory. This
  option causes the specified directory to be signed and tags its entries as
  inline JavaScript. This special type of entry does not have to appear in the
  JAR file itself. Instead, it is located in the HTML page containing the inline
  scripts. When you use signtool -v, these entries are displayed with the string
  NOT PRESENT.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-k key ... directory
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Specifies the nickname (key) of the
  certificate you want to sign with and signs the files in the specified
  directory. The directory to sign is always specified as the last command-line
  argument. Thus, it is possible to write signtool -k MyCert -d . signdir You
  may have trouble if the nickname contains a single quotation mark. To avoid
  problems, escape the quotation mark using the escape conventions for your
  platform. It's also possible to use the -k option without signing any files or
  specifying a directory. For example, you can use it with the -l option to get
  detailed information about a particular signing certificate.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-l
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Lists signing certificates, including issuing
  CAs. If any of your certificates are expired or invalid, the list will so
  specify. This option can be used with the -k option to list detailed
  information about a particular signing certificate. The -l option is available
  in Netscape Signing Tool 1.0 and later versions only.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-L
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Lists the certificates in your database. An
  asterisk appears to the left of the nickname for any certificate that can be
  used to sign objects with signtool.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
--leavearc
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Retains the temporary .arc (archive)
  directories that the -J option creates. These directories are automatically
  erased by default. Retaining the temporary directories can be an aid to
  debugging.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-m metafile
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Specifies the name of a metadata control file.
  Metadata is signed information attached either to the JAR archive itself or to
  files within the archive. This metadata can be any ASCII string, but is used
  mainly for specifying an installer script. The metadata file contains one
  entry per line, each with three fields: field #1: file specification, or + if
  you want to specify global metadata (that is, metadata about the JAR archive
  itself or all entries in the archive) field #2: the name of the data you are
  specifying; for example: Install-Script field #3: data corresponding to the
  name in field #2 For example, the -i option uses the equivalent of this line:
  + Install-Script: script.js This example associates a MIME type with a file:
  movie.qt MIME-Type: video/quicktime For information about the way installer
  script information appears in the manifest file for a JAR archive, see The JAR
  Format on Netscape DevEdge.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-M
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Lists the PKCS #11 modules available to
  signtool, including smart cards. The -M option is available in Netscape
  Signing Tool 1.0 and later versions only. For information on using Netscape
  Signing Tool with smart cards, see &quot;Using Netscape Signing Tool with
  Smart Cards&quot;. For information on using the -M option to verify FIPS-140-1
  validated mode, see &quot;Netscape Signing Tool and FIPS-140-1&quot;.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
--norecurse
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Blocks recursion into subdirectories when
  signing a directory's contents or when parsing HTML.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-o
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Optimizes the archive for size. Use this only
  if you are signing very large archives containing hundreds of files. This
  option makes the manifest files (required by the JAR format) considerably
  smaller, but they contain slightly less information.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
--outfile outputfile
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Specifies a file to receive redirected output
  from Netscape Signing Tool.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-p password
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Specifies a password for the private-key
  database. Note that the password entered on the command line is displayed as
  plain text.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-s keysize
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Specifies the size of the key for generated
  certificate. Use the -M option to find out what tokens are available. The -s
  option can be used with the -G option only.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-t token
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Specifies which available token should
  generate the key and receive the certificate. Use the -M option to find out
  what tokens are available. The -t option can be used with the -G option
  only.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-v archive
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Displays the contents of an archive and
  verifies the cryptographic integrity of the digital signatures it contains and
  the files with which they are associated. This includes checking that the
  certificate for the issuer of the object-signing certificate is listed in the
  certificate database, that the CA's digital signature on the object-signing
  certificate is valid, that the relevant certificates have not expired, and so
  on.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
--verbosity value
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Sets the quantity of information Netscape
  Signing Tool generates in operation. A value of 0 (zero) is the default and
  gives full information. A value of -1 suppresses most messages, but not error
  messages.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-w archive
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Displays the names of signers of any files in
  the archive.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-x directory
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Excludes the specified directory from signing.
  Note that with Netscape Signing Tool version 1.1 and later this option can
  appear multiple times on one command line, making it possible to specify
  several particular directories to exclude.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-z
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Tells signtool not to store the signing time
  in the digital signature. This option is useful if you want the expiration
  date of the signature checked against the current date and time rather than
  the time the files were signed.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-Z jarfile
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Creates a JAR file with the specified name.
  You must specify this option if you want signtool to create the JAR file; it
  does not do so automatically. If you don't specify -Z, you must use an
  external ZIP tool to create the JAR file. The -Z option cannot be used at the
  same time as the -J option. If the -c# option is not used with the -Z option,
  the default compression value is 6.</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="THE_COMMAND_FILE_FORMAT"><a class="selflink" href="#THE_COMMAND_FILE_FORMAT">THE
  COMMAND FILE FORMAT</a></h1>
Entries in a Netscape Signing Tool command file have this general format:
  keyword=value Everything before the = sign on a single line is a keyword, and
  everything from the = sign to the end of line is a value. The value may
  include = signs; only the first = sign on a line is interpreted. Blank lines
  are ignored, but white space on a line with keywords and values is assumed to
  be part of the keyword (if it comes before the equal sign) or part of the
  value (if it comes after the first equal sign). Keywords are case insensitive,
  values are generally case sensitive. Since the = sign and newline delimit the
  value, it should not be quoted.

  It takes the nickname of the new certificate as an argument. The newly
  generated keys and certificate are installed into the key and certificate
  databases in the directory specified by the -d option. With the NT version of
  Netscape Signing Tool, you must use the -d option with the -G option. With the
  Unix version of Netscape Signing Tool, omitting the -d option causes the tool
  to install the keys and certificate in the Communicator key and certificate
  databases. In all cases, the certificate is also output to a file named
  x509.cacert, which has the MIME-type application/x-x509-ca-cert.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Certificates contain standard information about the entity they identify, such
  as the common name and organization name. Netscape Signing Tool prompts you
  for this information when you run the command with the -G option. However, all
  of the requested fields are optional for test certificates. If you do not
  enter a common name, the tool provides a default name. In the following
  example, the user input is in boldface:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<pre>
signtool -G MyTestCert
<div class="Pp"></div>
using certificate directory: /u/someuser/.netscape
Enter certificate information. All fields are optional. Acceptable
characters are numbers, letters, spaces, and apostrophes.
certificate common name: Test Object Signing Certificate
organization: Netscape Communications Corp.
organization unit: Server Products Division
state or province: California
country (must be exactly 2 characters): US
username: someuser
email address: someuser@netscape.com
Enter Password or Pin for &quot;Communicator Certificate DB&quot;: [Password will not echo]
generated public/private key pair
certificate request generated
certificate has been signed
certificate &quot;MyTestCert&quot; added to database
Exported certificate to x509.raw and x509.cacert.
</pre>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The certificate information is read from standard input. Therefore, the
  information can be read from a file using the redirection operator (&lt;) in
  some operating systems. To create a file for this purpose, enter each of the
  seven input fields, in order, on a separate line. Make sure there is a newline
  character at the end of the last line. Then run signtool with standard input
  redirected from your file as follows:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<pre>
signtool -G MyTestCert inputfile
</pre>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The prompts show up on the screen, but the responses will be automatically read
  from the file. The password will still be read from the console unless you use
  the -p option to give the password on the command line.

<b>Using the -M Option to List Smart Cards</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can use the -M option to list the PKCS #11 modules, including smart cards,
  that are available to signtool:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<pre>
signtool -d &quot;c:\netscape\users\jsmith&quot; -M
<div class="Pp"></div>
using certificate directory: c:\netscape\users\username

<b>Using Netscape Signing Tool and a Smart Card to Sign Files</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The signtool command normally takes an argument of the -k option to specify a
  signing certificate. To sign with a smart card, you supply only the fully
  qualified name of the certificate.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To see fully qualified certificate names when you run Communicator, click the
  Security button in Navigator, then click Yours under Certificates in the left
  frame. Fully qualified names are of the format smart card:certificate, for
  example &quot;MyCard:My Signing Cert&quot;. You use this name with the -k
  argument as follows:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<pre>
signtool -k &quot;MyCard:My Signing Cert&quot; directory
</pre>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Verifying FIPS Mode</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Use the -M option to verify that you are using the FIPS-140-1 module.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<pre>
signtool -d &quot;c:\netscape\users\jsmith&quot; -M
<div class="Pp"></div>
using certificate directory: c:\netscape\users\jsmith
