<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The Signing Tool, signtool, creates digital signatures and
uses a Java Archive (JAR) file to associate the signatures
with files in a directory. Electronic software distribution
<br>
over any network involves potential security problems. To
help address some of these problems, you can associate
digital signatures with the files in a JAR archive. Digital
<br>
signatures allow SSL-enabled clients to perform two
important operations:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Confirm the identity of the
individual, company, or other entity whose digital signature
is associated with the files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Check whether the files have
been tampered with since being signed</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you have a signing
certificate, you can use Netscape Signing Tool to digitally
sign files and package them as a JAR file. An object-signing
certificate is a special kind of <br>
certificate that allows you to associate your digital
signature with one or more files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An individual file can
potentially be signed with multiple digital signatures. For
example, a commercial software developer might sign the
files that constitute a software <br>
product to prove that the files are indeed from a particular
company. A network administrator manager might sign the same
files with an additional digital signature based on a <br>
company-generated certificate to indicate that the product
is approved for use within the company.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The significance of a digital
signature is comparable to the significance of a handwritten
signature. Once you have signed a file, it is difficult to
claim later that you didn&rsquo;t <br>
sign it. In some situations, a digital signature may be
considered as legally binding as a handwritten signature.
Therefore, you should take great care to ensure that you can
<br>
stand behind any file you sign and distribute.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, if you are a
software developer, you should test your code to make sure
it is virus-free before signing it. Similarly, if you are a
network administrator, you should <br>
make sure, before signing any code, that it comes from a
reliable source and will run correctly with the software
installed on the machines to which you are distributing
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Before you can use Netscape
Signing Tool to sign files, you must have an object-signing
certificate, which is a special certificate whose associated
private key is used to create <br>
digital signatures. For testing purposes only, you can
create an object-signing certificate with Netscape Signing
Tool 1.3. When testing is finished and you are ready to <br>
disitribute your software, you should obtain an
object-signing certificate from one of two kinds of
sources:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* An independent certificate
authority (CA) that authenticates your identity and charges
you a fee. You typically get a certificate from an
independent CA if you want to sign <br>
software that will be distributed over the Internet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* CA server software running on
your corporate intranet or extranet. Netscape Certificate
Management System provides a complete management solution
for creating, deploying, and <br>
managing certificates, including CAs that issue
object-signing certificates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You must also have a certificate
for the CA that issues your signing certificate before you
can sign files. If the certificate authority&rsquo;s
certificate isn&rsquo;t already installed in <br>
your copy of Communicator, you typically install it by
clicking the appropriate link on the certificate
authority&rsquo;s web site, for example on the page from
which you initiated <br>
enrollment for your signing certificate. This is the case
for some test certificates, as well as certificates issued
by Netscape Certificate Management System: you must download
<br>
the the CA certificate in addition to obtaining your own
signing certificate. CA certificates for several certificate
authorities are preinstalled in the Communicator certificate
<br>
database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When you receive an
object-signing certificate for your own use, it is
automatically installed in your copy of the Communicator
client software. Communicator supports the <br>
public-key cryptography standard known as PKCS #12, which
governs key portability. You can, for example, move an
object-signing certificate and its associated private key
from <br>
one computer to another on a credit-card-sized device called
a smart card.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-b basename <br>
Specifies the base filename for the .rsa and .sf files in
the META-INF directory to conform with the JAR format. For
example, -b signatures causes the files to be named <br>
signatures.rsa and signatures.sf. The default is
signtool.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c# <br>
Specifies the compression level for the -J or -Z option. The
symbol # represents a number from 0 to 9, where 0 means no
compression and 9 means maximum compression. The <br>
higher the level of compression, the smaller the output but
the longer the operation takes. If the -c# option is not
used with either the -J or the -Z option, the default <br>
compression value used by both the -J and -Z options is
6.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d certdir <br>
Specifies your certificate database directory; that is, the
directory in which you placed your key3.db and cert7.db
files. To specify the current directory, use &quot;-d.&quot;
<br>
(including the period). The Unix version of signtool assumes
~/.netscape unless told otherwise. The NT version of
signtool always requires the use of the -d option to specify
<br>
where the database files are located.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e extension <br>
Tells signtool to sign only files with the given extension;
for example, use -e&quot;.class&quot; to sign only Java
class files. Note that with Netscape Signing Tool version
1.1 and <br>
later this option can appear multiple times on one command
line, making it possible to specify multiple file types or
classes to include.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f commandfile <br>
Specifies a text file containing Netscape Signing Tool
options and arguments in keyword=value format. All options
and arguments can be expressed through this file. For more
<br>
information about the syntax used with this file, see
&quot;Tips and Techniques&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-G nickname <br>
Generates a new private-public key pair and corresponding
object-signing certificate with the given nickname. The
newly generated keys and certificate are installed into the
<br>
key and certificate databases in the directory specified by
the -d option. With the NT version of Netscape Signing Tool,
you must use the -d option with the -G option. With <br>
the Unix version of Netscape Signing Tool, omitting the -d
option causes the tool to install the keys and certificate
in the Communicator key and certificate databases. If <br>
you are installing the keys and certificate in the
Communicator databases, you must exit Communicator before
using this option; otherwise, you risk corrupting the
databases. <br>
In all cases, the certificate is also output to a file named
x509.cacert, which has the MIME-type
application/x-x509-ca-cert. Unlike certificates normally
used to sign <br>
finished code to be distributed over a network, a test
certificate created with -G is not signed by a recognized
certificate authority. Instead, it is self-signed. In <br>
addition, a single test signing certificate functions as
both an object-signing certificate and a CA. When you are
using it to sign objects, it behaves like an object-signing
<br>
certificate. When it is imported into browser software such
as Communicator, it behaves like an object-signing CA and
cannot be used to sign objects. The -G option is <br>
available in Netscape Signing Tool 1.0 and later versions
only. By default, it produces only RSA certificates with
1024-byte keys in the internal token. However, you can use
<br>
the -s option specify the required key size and the -t
option to specify the token.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i scriptname <br>
Specifies the name of an installer script for SmartUpdate.
This script installs files from the JAR archive in the local
system after SmartUpdate has validated the digital <br>
signature. For more details, see the description of -m that
follows. The -i option provides a straightforward way to
provide this information if you don&rsquo;t need to specify
any <br>
metadata other than an installer script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-J <br>
Signs a directory of HTML files containing JavaScript and
creates as many archive files as are specified in the HTML
tags. Even if signtool creates more than one archive <br>
file, you need to supply the key database password only
once. The -J option is available only in Netscape Signing
Tool 1.0 and later versions. The -J option cannot be used at
<br>
the same time as the -Z option. If the -c# option is not
used with the -J option, the default compression value is 6.
Note that versions 1.1 and later of Netscape Signing <br>
Tool correctly recognizes the CODEBASE attribute, allows
paths to be expressed for the CLASS and SRC attributes
instead of filenames only, processes LINK tags and parses
HTML <br>
correctly, and offers clearer error messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-j directory <br>
Specifies a special JavaScript directory. This option causes
the specified directory to be signed and tags its entries as
inline JavaScript. This special type of entry does <br>
not have to appear in the JAR file itself. Instead, it is
located in the HTML page containing the inline scripts. When
you use signtool -v, these entries are displayed with <br>
the string NOT PRESENT.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k key ... directory <br>
Specifies the nickname (key) of the certificate you want to
sign with and signs the files in the specified directory.
The directory to sign is always specified as the last <br>
command-line argument. Thus, it is possible to write
signtool -k MyCert -d . signdir You may have trouble if the
nickname contains a single quotation mark. To avoid
problems, <br>
escape the quotation mark using the escape conventions for
your platform. It&rsquo;s also possible to use the -k option
without signing any files or specifying a directory. For
<br>
example, you can use it with the -l option to get detailed
information about a particular signing certificate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l <br>
Lists signing certificates, including issuing CAs. If any of
your certificates are expired or invalid, the list will so
specify. This option can be used with the -k option to <br>
list detailed information about a particular signing
certificate. The -l option is available in Netscape Signing
Tool 1.0 and later versions only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L <br>
Lists the certificates in your database. An asterisk appears
to the left of the nickname for any certificate that can be
used to sign objects with signtool.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--leavearc <br>
Retains the temporary .arc (archive) directories that the -J
option creates. These directories are automatically erased
by default. Retaining the temporary directories can be <br>
an aid to debugging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m metafile <br>
Specifies the name of a metadata control file. Metadata is
signed information attached either to the JAR archive itself
or to files within the archive. This metadata can be <br>
any ASCII string, but is used mainly for specifying an
installer script. The metadata file contains one entry per
line, each with three fields: field #1: file specification,
<br>
or + if you want to specify global metadata (that is,
metadata about the JAR archive itself or all entries in the
archive) field #2: the name of the data you are specifying;
<br>
for example: Install-Script field #3: data corresponding to
the name in field #2 For example, the -i option uses the
equivalent of this line: + Install-Script: script.js This
<br>
example associates a MIME type with a file: movie.qt
MIME-Type: video/quicktime For information about the way
installer script information appears in the manifest file
for a <br>
JAR archive, see The JAR Format on Netscape DevEdge.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M <br>
Lists the PKCS #11 modules available to signtool, including
smart cards. The -M option is available in Netscape Signing
Tool 1.0 and later versions only. For information on <br>
using Netscape Signing Tool with smart cards, see
&quot;Using Netscape Signing Tool with Smart Cards&quot;.
For information on using the -M option to verify FIPS-140-1
validated mode, <br>
see &quot;Netscape Signing Tool and FIPS-140-1&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--norecurse <br>
Blocks recursion into subdirectories when signing a
directory&rsquo;s contents or when parsing HTML.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o <br>
Optimizes the archive for size. Use this only if you are
signing very large archives containing hundreds of files.
This option makes the manifest files (required by the JAR
<br>
format) considerably smaller, but they contain slightly less
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--outfile outputfile <br>
Specifies a file to receive redirected output from Netscape
Signing Tool.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p password <br>
Specifies a password for the private-key database. Note that
the password entered on the command line is displayed as
plain text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s keysize <br>
Specifies the size of the key for generated certificate. Use
the -M option to find out what tokens are available. The -s
option can be used with the -G option only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t token <br>
Specifies which available token should generate the key and
receive the certificate. Use the -M option to find out what
tokens are available. The -t option can be used with <br>
the -G option only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v archive <br>
Displays the contents of an archive and verifies the
cryptographic integrity of the digital signatures it
contains and the files with which they are associated. This
includes <br>
checking that the certificate for the issuer of the
object-signing certificate is listed in the certificate
database, that the CA&rsquo;s digital signature on the
object-signing <br>
certificate is valid, that the relevant certificates have
not expired, and so on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--verbosity value <br>
Sets the quantity of information Netscape Signing Tool
generates in operation. A value of 0 (zero) is the default
and gives full information. A value of -1 suppresses most
<br>
messages, but not error messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w archive <br>
Displays the names of signers of any files in the
archive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x directory <br>
Excludes the specified directory from signing. Note that
with Netscape Signing Tool version 1.1 and later this option
can appear multiple times on one command line, making it
<br>
possible to specify several particular directories to
exclude.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z <br>
Tells signtool not to store the signing time in the digital
signature. This option is useful if you want the expiration
date of the signature checked against the current date <br>
and time rather than the time the files were signed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Z jarfile <br>
Creates a JAR file with the specified name. You must specify
this option if you want signtool to create the JAR file; it
does not do so automatically. If you don&rsquo;t specify
<br>
-Z, you must use an external ZIP tool to create the JAR
file. The -Z option cannot be used at the same time as the
-J option. If the -c# option is not used with the -Z <br>
option, the default compression value is 6.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THE COMMAND FILE FORMAT <br>
Entries in a Netscape Signing Tool command file have this
general format: keyword=value Everything before the = sign
on a single line is a keyword, and everything from the =
sign <br>
to the end of line is a value. The value may include =
signs; only the first = sign on a line is interpreted. Blank
lines are ignored, but white space on a line with keywords
and <br>
values is assumed to be part of the keyword (if it comes
before the equal sign) or part of the value (if it comes
after the first equal sign). Keywords are case insensitive,
<br>
values are generally case sensitive. Since the = sign and
newline delimit the value, it should not be quoted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using Netscape Signing Tool with
a ZIP Utility</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To use Netscape Signing Tool
with a ZIP utility, you must have the utility in your path
environment variable. You should use the zip.exe utility
rather than pkzip.exe, which <br>
cannot handle long filenames. You can use a ZIP utility
instead of the -Z option to package a signed archive into a
JAR file after you have signed it:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cd signdir</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zip -r ../myjar.jar * <br>

adding: META-INF/signtool.rsa (stored 0%) <br>
adding: text.txt (stored 0%)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Generating the Keys and
Certificate</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The signtool option -G generates
a new public-private key pair and certificate. It takes the
nickname of the new certificate as an argument. The newly
generated keys and <br>
certificate are installed into the key and certificate
databases in the directory specified by the -d option. With
the NT version of Netscape Signing Tool, you must use the -d
<br>
option with the -G option. With the Unix version of Netscape
Signing Tool, omitting the -d option causes the tool to
install the keys and certificate in the Communicator key and
<br>
certificate databases. In all cases, the certificate is also
output to a file named x509.cacert, which has the MIME-type
application/x-x509-ca-cert.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Certificates contain standard
information about the entity they identify, such as the
common name and organization name. Netscape Signing Tool
prompts you for this information <br>
when you run the command with the -G option. However, all of
the requested fields are optional for test certificates. If
you do not enter a common name, the tool provides a <br>
default name. In the following example, the user input is in
boldface:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">signtool -G MyTestCert</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The certificate information is
read from standard input. Therefore, the information can be
read from a file using the redirection operator (&lt;) in
some operating systems. To <br>
create a file for this purpose, enter each of the seven
input fields, in order, on a separate line. Make sure there
is a newline character at the end of the last line. Then run
<br>
signtool with standard input redirected from your file as
follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">signtool -G MyTestCert
inputfile</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The prompts show up on the
screen, but the responses will be automatically read from
the file. The password will still be read from the console
unless you use the -p option to <br>
give the password on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using the -M Option to List
Smart Cards</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can use the -M option to
list the PKCS #11 modules, including smart cards, that are
available to signtool:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">signtool -d
&quot;c:0tscapesersjsmith&quot; -M</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using Netscape Signing Tool and
a Smart Card to Sign Files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The signtool command normally
takes an argument of the -k option to specify a signing
certificate. To sign with a smart card, you supply only the
fully qualified name of the <br>
certificate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To see fully qualified
certificate names when you run Communicator, click the
Security button in Navigator, then click Yours under
Certificates in the left frame. Fully qualified <br>
names are of the format smart card:certificate, for example
&quot;MyCard:My Signing Cert&quot;. You use this name with
the -k argument as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">signtool -k &quot;MyCard:My
Signing Cert&quot; directory</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Verifying FIPS Mode</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use the -M option to verify that
you are using the FIPS-140-1 module.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">signtool -d
