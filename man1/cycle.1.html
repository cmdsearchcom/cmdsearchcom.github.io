<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Cycle is a calendar program for women. Given a cycle length
or statistics for several periods, it can calculate the days
until menstruation, the days of &quot;safe&quot; sex, the
fertile <br>
period, and the days to ovulations, and define the d.o.b.
(date of birth) of a child. It allows the user to write
notes and helps to supervise the reception of hormonal
contra&acirc; <br>
ceptive tablets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FEATURES <br>
The program is capable of:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Calculate of the days of
menstruation, based on length of the cycle or on statistics
of a period. <br>
- Calculate the &quot;safe&quot; sex days, fertile period
and day to ovulations <br>
- Definition of D.O.B . (Date Of Birth) of a child <br>
- Allows one to write notes <br>
- Helps to supervise reception of hormonal contraceptive
tablets</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOW DOES IT WORK <br>
It uses the calendar method for the definition of fertile
days. For this is necessary to determine duration, at least,
of last six cycles. For determine the fertile days it uses
<br>
this algorithm:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- First day: duration of
shortest cycle minus 18 <br>
- Last day: duration of longest cycle minus 11 <br>
- Ovulation: is considered in the middle of fertile period
(Determine the exact day isn&rsquo;t possible with the
calendar method)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Date of a birth of the child is
counted from the beginning of last menstruation (in
obstetrics are accepted 40 weeks). This date is corrected
with the duration of a cycle (are <br>
subtracted or added same number of days that a cycle differs
from 28 days). Is possible check the results at:
http://cir.msk.ru/sroki.shtml (in Russian)</p>

It is necessary to mark the beginning of menstruation. This
is possible clicking with the right button on the date and
chosing &quot;The beginning of a cycle&quot;. Similarly the
mark can <br>
be removed. Using duration of last six cycles, the program

<br>
- Ovulation day (the middle fertile period) - brightly green
cell <br>
- Beginning of following menstruation - pink cells</p>

their reception. Closely familiarize with the instruction
applied to the chosen prepara&acirc; <br>
tion. Packing can contain 21 tablet (the circuit of
reception 21 day on one tablet, then 7 days pause) or 28
tablets in this case all tablets are accepted without

reception of each first tablet of packing.</p>

reliable contraceptive method. It does neither help to
