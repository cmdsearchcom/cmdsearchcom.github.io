  notes and helps to supervise the reception of hormonal contraceptive tablets.

It uses the calendar method for the definition of fertile days. For this is
  necessary to determine duration, at least, of last six cycles. For determine
  the fertile days it uses this algorithm:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 - First day: duration of shortest cycle minus 18
<br/>
 - Last day: duration of longest cycle minus 11
<br/>
 - Ovulation: is considered in the middle of fertile period (Determine the exact
  day isn't possible with the calendar method)
<div class="Pp"></div>
Date of a birth of the child is counted from the beginning of last menstruation
  (in obstetrics are accepted 40 weeks). This date is corrected with the
  duration of a cycle (are subtracted or added same number of days that a cycle
  differs from 28 days). Is possible check the results at:
  http://cir.msk.ru/sroki.shtml (in Russian)
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="USAGE"><a class="selflink" href="#USAGE">USAGE</a></h1>
It is necessary to mark the beginning of menstruation. This is possible clicking
  with the right button on the date and chosing &quot;The beginning of a
  cycle&quot;. Similarly the mark can be removed. Using duration of last six
  cycles, the program will calculate
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 - Fertile period - green cells
<br/>
 - Ovulation day (the middle fertile period) - brightly green cell
<br/>
 - Beginning of following menstruation - pink cells
<div class="Pp"></div>
Cycle duration is set in options or is calculated an average of last six
  periods.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
To determine prospective date of a birth of the child, it is necessary first day
  of last cycle to mark in addition as &quot;Pregnancy&quot;.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>

  only fertile days. Information about interesting day can be received clicking
  with left button.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>

<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>

  is about 10 percent. This method is suitable only for women with enough
  regular cycle.

If your doctor has recommended hormonal contraceptive this program will help to
  supervise their reception. Closely familiarize with the instruction applied to
  the chosen preparation. Packing can contain 21 tablet (the circuit of
  reception 21 day on one tablet, then 7 days pause) or 28 tablets in this case
  all tablets are accepted without interruption every day of 28. In the program,
  is marked only day of reception of each first tablet of packing.

  statistical conclusions from them. You cannot consider this program as a
  substitute for your gynecologist in any way.
