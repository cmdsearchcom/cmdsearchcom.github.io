<p>TCPREEN(1) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual TCPREEN(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
tcpreen - TCP stream monitoring tool</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
tcpreen [-cdflnqv] [-b maxbytes] [ -f format] [-F
maxclients] [-m maxconnect] [ -o logfile] [-u user] [-a
bindaddress] [ -s servername] [-p proto1/proto2] serverport
[localport]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTON <br>
TCPreen monitors and let the user analyse data transmitted
between clients and servers via TCP connections. It focuses
on the data stream and operates at the software layer, not
<br>
on lower level transmission protocols as a packet sniffers
do.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It works like a bridge between a
server and clients that communicates through TCP sessions,
and can display or save data that is sent either way.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In standard mode, TCPreen opens
a listening socket (on port localport which is dynamically
allocated by default), and waits until a client connects to
it. Then, it connects to <br>
the server (on port serverport) and forwards data between
each hosts until the session is closed by either side.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-a interface, --accept interface or --bind interface <br>
Specify an interface that will be used to listen for client
connections. By default, all network interfaces are
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b bytecount or --bytes
bytecount <br>
Limit the length of a TCP session to bytecount bytes. If a
session exceeds this quantity, it will be closed on the next
data packet boundary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c or --connect <br>
Connect to the specified client instead of waiting for the
client to connect. This is meant for expert users who know
what they are doing only. If no hostname is speci&acirc;
<br>
fied, TCPreen will try to connect to the local host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use -a address to specify the
client address to connect to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d or --daemon <br>
Turn on daemon mode. When this option is selected, TCPreen
will run in the background and send informations to syslog
instead of the console. This enables quiet mode and <br>
multiple clients mode automatically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You will probably want to use
option -F as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: if you turn this feature
on, log files will be created from the root directory, not
from the current one. See daemon(3) for more details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f logformat or --format
logformat <br>
Selects a format for output. Supported formats includes: C
(C source strings-like encoding), hex (hexadecimal data
dump), count (write quantities of data), null (only
dis&acirc; <br>
plays new connections addresses), password (basic password
capture, unfinished yet), raw (write data as is, even if it
is not 7-bit clean), strip (replace non printable <br>
characters with dots).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F nproc or --fork nproc <br>
Specifies the maximum number of sessions that can be treated
at the same time. By default, only one session is allowed at
a time not so as to keep the program output easy <br>
to read.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h or --help <br>
Display some help and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l or --listen <br>
Listen for the &quot;server&quot; instead of connecting to
it. This can be used by advanced users to run a human
brain-powered server by telnet-ing to TCPreen server
address. An <br>
optionnal listening interface address can be specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m conn_num or --maxconn
conn_num <br>
Handle conn_num consecutive client connections before
exiting. When this option is not used, the program will run
forever (until interrupted).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n or --numeric <br>
Disable reverse DNS lookup and service name resolution. Node
names and port numbers will appear in numeric form. This
option will speed up connections a little.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o logfile or --output logfile
<br>
Save data to file logfile. If it already exists, it will be
overwritten. &quot;-&quot; is used for stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Multiple log files can be used
(with different formats). For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tcpreen -f hex -o hexafile.log
-f C -o file.log smtp</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will save hexafile.log in
hexadecimal and file.log in C encoding.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p or --protocol <br>
Specifies which network protocol(s) is/are going to be used.
If a single protocol name is specified, it will be used both
ways. Two different protocols can be used on <br>
each side by separating them with a slash like this:
&rsquo;tcp/tcp6&rsquo;. The first protocol will then be used
to communicate with the server, the last one will be used to
exchange <br>
data with the client.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following protocols are
currently recognized: tcp (TCP over IPv4), tcp6 (TCP over
IPv6) and unix or local (Unix interprocess streams). By
default, tcp is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q or --quiet <br>
Turn on quiet mode: Do not write anything on the standard
output (stdout).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s hostname or --server hostname
<br>
Connect to the specified server instead of the local host
which is used by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u user or --user user <br>
When run as super-user, drop privilege and set UID to that
of user (it must be a valid username). That is highly
recommended if tcpreen is to be bound to a reserved port,
<br>
which only root can bind on Unix systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You must be root to use this
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v or --verbose <br>
Increase program verbosity. This can be cumulated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V or --version <br>
Display program version and license and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
These are common problems:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Nothing happens: <br>
The client is communicating with the server correctly, but
TCPreen stays quiet. Make sure you told the client to
connect to TCPreen address rather than the actual server
<br>
address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Make sure you have enabled
verbose mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Strange port names: <br>
Have a look at /etc/services and you will realize what this
means. Alternatively, you may want to use -n.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SECURITY <br>
tcpreen requires root privileges to be bound to a reserved
TCP port (under 1024). If you really need to do so, you may
run tcpreen Set-UID root. In such circumstances, you must
<br>
ensure that only trustworthy users can run tcpreen, as it
could be used to divert traffic to any reserved ports on the
system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tcpreen will automatically drop
privileges as soon as it has allocated its listening
socket(s) to limit exposure. Log files are always created
with the default permission of the <br>
current user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Care should be taken when using
tcpreen as it could be used to access your network or system
from the outside (that is why it will normally refuse to run
as root).</p>
