<p style="margin-top: 1em">ARGUMENTS <br>
filename ... <br>
job description files describing the jobs to be
submitted</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTENDED DESCRIPTION <br>
arcsub is the key command when submitting jobs to Grid
enabled computing resources with the ARC client. As default
arcsub is able to submit jobs to A-REX, CREAM and EMI ES
<br>
enabled computing elements (CEs), and as always for
successful submission you need to be authenticated at the
targeted computing services. Since arcsub is build on a
modular <br>
library, modules can be installed which enables submission
to other targets, e.g. the classic ARC CE Grid-Manager.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Job submission can be
accomplished by specifying a job description file to submit
as an argument. arcsub will then by default perform resource
discovery on the Grid and then the <br>
discovered resources will be matched to the job description
and ranked according to the chosen broker (--broker option).
If no Grid environment has been configured, please
con&acirc; <br>
tact your system administrator, or setup one yourself in the
client configuration file (see files section). Another
option is to explicitly specify a registry service (or
multi&acirc; <br>
ple) to arcsub using the --index option, which accepts an
URL, alias or group. Alternatively a specific CE (or
multiple) can be targeted by using the --cluster option. If
such a <br>
scenario is the most common, it is worthwhile to specify
those CEs in the client configuration as default services,
which makes it superfluous to specify them as argument. In
the <br>
same manner aliases and groups, defined in the configuration
file, can be utilized, and can be used as argument to the
--cluster or --index options. In all of the above
scenar&acirc; <br>
ios arcsub obtains resource information from the services
which is then used for matchmaking against the job
description, however that step can be avoided by specifying
the <br>
--direct option, in which case the job description is
submitted directly to first specified endpoint.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The format of a classic
GRIDFTP-based cluster URLs: <br>

[ldap://]&lt;hostname&gt;[:2135/nordugrid-cluster-name=&lt;hostname&gt;,Mds-Vo-name=local,o=grid]
<br>
Only the hostname part has to be specified, the rest of the
URL is automatically generated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The format of an A-REX URL is:
<br>
[https://]&lt;hostname&gt;[:&lt;port&gt;][/&lt;path&gt;]
<br>
Here the port is 443 by default, but the path cannot be
guessed, so if it is not specified, then the service is
assumed to live on the root path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Job descriptions can also be
specified using the --jobdescrfile option which expect the
file name of the description as argument, or the
--jobdescrstring option which expect as <br>
argument the job description as a string, and both options
can be specified multiple times and one does not exclude the
other. The default supported job description languages are
<br>
xRSL, JSDL and JDL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the job description is
successfully submitted a job-ID is returned and printed.
This job-ID uniquely identifies the job while it is being
executed. On the other hand it is <br>
also possible that no CEs matches the constraints defined in
the description in which case no submission will be done.
Upon successful submission, the job-ID along with more <br>
technical job information is stored in the job-list file
(described below). The stored information enables the job
management commands of the ARC client to manage jobs easily,
<br>
and thus the job-ID need not to be saved manually. By
default the job-list file is stored in the .arc directory in
the home directory of the user, however another location can
be <br>
specified using the --joblist option taking the location of
this file as argument. If the --joblist option was used
during submission, it should also be specified in the
consecu&acirc; <br>
tive commands when managing the job. If a Computing Element
has multiple job submission interfaces (e.g. gridftp,
EMI-ES, BES), then the brokering algorithm will choose one
of <br>
them. With the --submissioninterface option the requested
interface can be specified, and in that case only those
Computing Elements will be considered which has that
specific <br>
interface, and only that interface will be used to submit
the jobs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As mentioned above registry or
index services can be specified with the --index option.
Specifying one or multiple index servers instructs the
arcsub command to query the servers <br>
for registered CEs, the returned CEs will then be matched
against the job description and those matching will be
ranked by the chosen broker (see below) and submission will
be <br>
tried in order until successful or reaching the end. From
the returned list of CEs it might happen that a troublesome
or undesirable CE is selected for submission, in that case
<br>
it possible to reject that cluster using the
--rejectdiscovery option and providing the URL (or just the
hostname) of the CE, which will disregard that CE as a
target for submis&acirc; <br>
sion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When multiple CEs are targeted
for submission, the resource broker will be used to filter
out CEs which do not match the job description requirements
and then rank the remaining <br>
CEs. The broker used by default will rank the CEs randomly,
however a different broker can be chosen by using the
--broker option, which takes the name of the broker as
argument. <br>
The broker type can also be specified in client.conf. The
brokers available can be seen using arcsub -P. By default
the following brokers are available:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Random (default) <br>
Chooses a random CE matching the job requirements.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FastestQueue <br>
Ranks matching CEs according to the length of the job queue
at the CEs, ranking those with shortest queue
first/highest.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Benchmark <br>
Ranks matching CEs according to a specified benchmark, which
should be specified by appending the broker name with
&rsquo;:&rsquo; and then the name of the benchmark. If no
option is <br>
given to the Benchmark broker then CEs will be ranked
according to the &rsquo;specint2000&rsquo; benchmark.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Data Ranks matching CEs
according to the amount of input data cached by each CE, by
querying the CE. Only CEs with the A-REX BES interface
support this operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Null Choose a random CE with no
filtering at all of CEs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PythonBroker <br>
User-defined custom brokers can be created in Python. See
the example broker SampleBroker.py or ACIXBroker.py (like
Data broker but uses the ARC Cache Index) that come <br>
installed with ARC for more details of how to write your own
broker. A PythonBroker is specified by --broker
PythonBroker:Filename.Class:args, where Filename is the file
<br>
containing the class Class which implements the broker
interface. The directory containing this file must be in the
PYTHONPATH. args is optional and allows specifying <br>
arguments to the broker.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Before submission, arcsub
performs an intelligent modification of the job description
(adding or modifying attributes, even converting the
description language to fit the needs <br>
of the CE) ensuring that it is valid. The modified job
description can be printed by specifying the
--dumpdescription option. The format, i.e. job description
language, of the <br>
printed job description cannot be specified, and will be
that which will be sent to and accepted by the chosen
target. Further information from arcsub can be obtained by
increas&acirc; <br>
ing the verbosity, which is done with the --debug option
where the default verbosity level is WARNING. Setting the
level to DEBUG will show all messages, while setting it to
<br>
FATAL will only show fatal log messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To validate your job description
without actually submitting a job, use the --dryrun option:
it will capture possible syntax or other errors, but will
instruct the site not to <br>
submit the job for execution. Only the grid-manager (ARC0)
and A-REX (ARC1) CEs support this feature.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Submission of a job description file
&quot;helloworld.jsdl&quot; to the Grid <br>
arcsub helloworld.jsdl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A information index server
(registry) can also be queried for CEs to submit to: <br>
arcsub -g registry.example.com helloworld.jsdl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Submission of a job description
file &quot;helloworld.jsdl&quot; to ce.example.com: <br>
arcsub -c ce.example.com helloworld.jsdl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Direct submission to a CE is
done as: <br>
arcsub --direct -c cd.example.com helloworld.jsdl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The job description can also be
specified directly on the command line as shown in the
example, using the XRSL job description language: <br>
arcsub -c example.com/arex -e
&Acirc;&acute;&amp;(executable=&quot;/bin/echo&quot;)(arguments=&quot;Hello
World!&quot;)&Acirc;&acute;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When submitting against CEs
retrieved from information index servers it might be useful
to do resource brokering: <br>
arcsub -g registry.example.com -b FastestQueue
helloworld.jsdl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the job has a large input
data set, it can be useful to send it to a CE where those
files are already cached. The ACIX broker can be used for
this: <br>
arcsub -g registry.example.com -b
PythonBroker:ACIXBroker.ACIXBroker:https://cacheindex.ndgf.org:6443/data/index
helloworld.jsdl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Disregarding a specific CE for
submission submitting against an information index server:
<br>
arcsub -g registry.example.com -R
badcomputingelement.com/arex helloworld.jsdl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Dumping the job description is
done as follows: <br>
arcsub -c example.com/arex -x helloworld.jsdl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
~/.arc/client.conf <br>
Some options can be given default values by specifying them
in the ARC client configuration file. Registry and computing
element services can be specified in separate sec&acirc;
<br>
tions of the config. The default services can be specified
by adding &rsquo;default=yes&rsquo; attribute to the section
of the service, thus when no --cluster or --index options
are <br>
given these will be used for submission. Each service has an
alias, and can be member of any number of groups. Then
specifying the alias or the name of the group with the <br>
--cluster or --index options will select the given services.
By using the --conffile option a different configuration
file can be used than the default. Note that some <br>
installations also have a system client configuration file,
however attributes in the client one takes precedence, and
then command line options takes precedence over con&acirc;
<br>
figuration file attributes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~/.arc/jobs.xml <br>
This a local list of the user&rsquo;s active jobs. When a
job is successfully submitted it is added to this list and
when it is removed from the remote cluster it is removed
<br>
from this list. This list is used as the list of all active
jobs when the user specifies the --all option to the various
NorduGrid ARC user interface commands. By using <br>
the --joblist option a different file can be used than the
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
X509_USER_PROXY <br>
The location of the user&rsquo;s Grid proxy file.
Shouldn&rsquo;t be set unless the proxy is in a non-standard
location.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ARC_LOCATION <br>
The location where ARC is installed can be specified by this
variable. If not specified the install location will be
determined from the path to the command being exe&acirc;
<br>
cuted, and if this fails a WARNING will be given stating the
location which will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ARC_PLUGIN_PATH <br>
The location of ARC plugins can be specified by this
variable. Multiple locations can be specified by separating
them by : (; in Windows). The default location is <br>
$ARC_LOCATION/lib/arc (&nbsp;in Windows).</p>
