<p>VGREP(1) General Commands Manual VGREP(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
vgrep, vegrep, vfgrep - print lines matching a pattern</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPOSIS <br>
vgrep [ vbind-options ] [ -[[AB] ]num ] [ -[CEFGVBchilnsvwx]
] [ -e ] pattern | -ffile ] [ names... ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Vgrep is GNU grep with a patch to access AtFS version
objects. Vgrep searches the files and AtFS version objects
listed in the arguments (or standard input if no names are
<br>
given, or the name - is given) for lines containing a match
to the given pattern. By default, vgrep prints the matching
lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are three major variants
of vgrep, controlled by the following options. <br>
-G Interpret pattern as a basic regular expression (see
below). This is the default. <br>
-E Interpret pattern as an extended regular expression (see
below). <br>
-F Interpret pattern as a list of fixed strings, separated
by newlines, any of which is to be matched. <br>
In addition, two variant programs vegrep and vfgrep are
available. Vegrep is similar (but not identical) to vgrep
-E, and is compatible with the historical Unix egrep. Vfgrep
<br>
is the same as vgrep -F.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Vgrep understands the standard
version binding options of the Shape toolkit. The names on
the command line are replaced by the appropriate version IDs
of the selected version <br>
object.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The vbind-options are
shapeTools&rsquo; standard options for version binding. A
description of these options can be found in the manual page
of vbind(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All variants of vgrep understand
the following options: <br>
-num Matches will be printed with num lines of leading and
trailing context. However, vgrep will never print any given
line more than once. <br>
-A num Print num lines of trailing context after matching
lines. <br>
-B num Print num lines of leading context before matching
lines. <br>
-C Equivalent to -2. <br>
-V Print the version number of vgrep to standard error. This
version number should be included in all bug reports (see
below). <br>
-b Print the byte offset within the input file before each
line of output. <br>
-c Suppress normal output; instead print a count of matching
lines for each input file. With the -v option (see below),
count non-matching lines. <br>
-e pattern <br>
Use pattern as the pattern; useful to protect patterns
beginning with -. <br>
-f file <br>
Obtain the pattern from file. <br>
-h Suppress the prefixing of filenames on output when
multiple files are searched. <br>
-i Ignore case distinctions in both the pattern and the
input files. <br>
-L Suppress normal output; instead print the name of each
input file from which no output would normally have been
printed. <br>
-l Suppress normal output; instead print the name of each
input file from which output would normally have been
printed. <br>
-n Prefix each line of output with the line number within
its input file. <br>
-q Quiet; suppress normal output. <br>
-s Suppress error messages about nonexistent or unreadable
files. <br>
-v Invert the sense of matching, to select non-matching
lines. <br>
-w Select only those lines containing matches that form
whole words. The test is that the matching substring must
either be at the beginning of the line, or preceded by a
<br>
non-word constituent character. Similarly, it must be either
at the end of the line or followed by a non-word constituent
character. Word-constituent characters are let&acirc; <br>
ters, digits, and the underscore. <br>
-x Select only those matches that exactly match the whole
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REGULAR EXPRESSIONS <br>
A regular expression is a pattern that describes a set of
strings. Regular expressions are constructed analagously to
arithmetic expressions, by using various operators to
com&acirc; <br>
bine smaller expressions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Vgrep understands two different
versions of regular expression syntax:
&lsquo;&lsquo;basic&rsquo;&rsquo; and
&lsquo;&lsquo;extended.&rsquo;&rsquo; In GNU grep, there is
no difference in available functionality using either <br>
syntax. In other implementations, basic regular expressions
are less powerful. The following description applies to
extended regular expressions; differences for basic regular
<br>
expressions are summarized afterwards.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The fundamental building blocks
are the regular expressions that match a single character.
Most characters, including all letters and digits, are
regular expressions that match <br>
themselves. Any metacharacter with special meaning may be
quoted by preceding it with a backslash.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A list of characters enclosed by
[ and ] matches any single character in that list; if the
first character of the list is the caret ^ then it matches
any character not in the <br>
list. For example, the regular expression [0123456789]
matches any single digit. A range of ASCII characters may be
specified by giving the first and last characters, separated
<br>
by a hyphen. Finally, certain named classes of characters
are predefined. Their names are self explanatory, and they
are [:alnum:], [:alpha:], [:cntrl:], [:digit:], [:graph:],
<br>
[:lower:], [:print:], [:punct:], [:space:], [:upper:], and
[:xdigit:]. For example, [[:alnum:]] means [0-9A-Za-z],
except the latter form is dependent upon the ASCII character
<br>
encoding, whereas the former is portable. (Note that the
brackets in these class names are part of the symbolic
names, and must be included in addition to the brackets
delimit&acirc; <br>
ing the bracket list.) Most metacharacters lose their
special meaning inside lists. To include a literal ] place
it first in the list. Similarly, to include a literal ^
place <br>
it anywhere but first. Finally, to include a literal - place
it last.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The period . matches any single
character. The symbol 48a synonym for [[:alnum:]] and W is a
synonym for [^[:alnum]].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The caret ^ and the dollar sign
$ are metacharacters that respectively match the empty
string at the beginning and end of a line. The symbols &lt;
and &gt; respectively match the <br>
empty string at the beginning and end of a word. The m a t
symbol cthe empty string at the edge of a word, and 0matches
the h e s empty string provided it&rsquo;s not at the edge
of a <br>
word.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A regular expression matching a
single character may be followed by one of several
repetition operators: <br>
? The preceding item is optional and matched at most once.
<br>
* The preceding item will be matched zero or more times.
<br>
+ The preceding item will be matched one or more times. <br>
{n} The preceding item is matched exactly n times. <br>
{n,} The preceding item is matched n or more times. <br>
{,m} The preceding item is optional and is matched at most m
times. <br>
{n,m} The preceding item is matched at least n times, but
not more than m times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Two regular expressions may be
concatenated; the resulting regular expression matches any
string formed by concatenating two substrings that
respectively match the concatenated <br>
subexpressions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Two regular expressions may be
joined by the infix operator |; the resulting regular
expression matches any string matching either
subexpression.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Repetition takes precedence over
concatenation, which in turn takes precedence over
alternation. A whole subexpression may be enclosed in
parentheses to override these prece&acirc; <br>
dence rules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The backreference 0 where n is a
single digit, matches the substring previously matched by
the nth parenthesized subexpression of the regular
expression.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In basic regular expressions the
metacharacters ?, +, {, |, (, and ) lose their special
meaning; instead use the backslashed versions <br>
In vegrep the metacharacter { loses its special meaning;
instead use .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
Normally, exit status is 0 if matches were found, and 1 if
no matches were found. (The -v option inverts the sense of
the exit status.) Exit status is 2 if there were syntax <br>
errors in the pattern, inaccessible input files, or other
system errors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Grep for &lsquo;&lsquo;foo&rsquo;&rsquo; in version 1.43 of
smile.c:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vgrep foo smile.c[1.43]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Grep for
&lsquo;&lsquo;foo&rsquo;&rsquo; in the last version of
smile.c (last saved version or busy file, if available):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vgrep -last foo smile.c</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Grep for
&lsquo;&lsquo;foo&rsquo;&rsquo; in all versions of C files
that have been created since February 14 1993:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vgrep -since 14.2.93 foo
&acirc;.c</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Grep for
&lsquo;&lsquo;foo&rsquo;&rsquo; in all versions carrying the
symbolic name &lsquo;&lsquo;Release-2.3&rsquo;&rsquo;:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vgrep foo
&acirc;[Release-2.3]</p>

Manual</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Email bug reports to bug-gnu-utils@prep.ai.mit.edu. Be sure
to include the word &lsquo;&lsquo;grep&rsquo;&rsquo;
somewhere in the &lsquo;&lsquo;Subject:&rsquo;&rsquo;
field.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Large repetition counts in the
{m,n} construct may cause vgrep to use lots of memory. In
addition, certain other obscure regular expressions require
exponential time and space, <br>
and may cause vgrep to run out of memory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Backreferences are very slow,
and may require exponential time.</p>
