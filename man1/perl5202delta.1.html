<br>
&Acirc;&middot; Bad symbol for scalar is now documented.
This error is not new, but was not previously documented
here.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Missing right
brace on is now documented. This error is not new, but was
not previously documented here.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Testing <br>
&Acirc;&middot; The test script re/rt122747.t has been added
to verify that perl #122747
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=122747&gt;
remains fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Platform Support <br>
Regained Platforms <br>
IRIX and Tru64 platforms are working again. (Some &quot;make
test&quot; failures remain.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Selected Bug Fixes <br>
&Acirc;&middot; AIX now sets the length in
&quot;getsockopt&quot; correctly. [perl #120835]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=120835&gt;,
[cpan #91183] <br>
&lt;https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=91183&gt;,
[cpan #85570]
&lt;https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=85570&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; In Perl 5.20.0,
$^N accidentally had the internal UTF8 flag turned off if
accessed from a code block within a regular expression,
effectively UTF8-encoding the value. This <br>
has been fixed. [perl #123135]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123135&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Various cases
where the name of a sub is used (autoload, overloading,
error messages) used to crash for lexical subs, but have
been fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; An assertion
failure when parsing &quot;sort&quot; with debugging enabled
has been fixed. [perl #122771]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=122771&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Loading UTF8
tables during a regular expression match could cause
assertion failures under debugging builds if the previous
match used the very same regular expression. <br>
[perl #122747]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=122747&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Due to a mistake
in the string-copying logic, copying the value of a state
variable could instead steal the value and undefine the
variable. This bug, introduced in Perl <br>
5.20, would happen mostly for long strings (1250 chars or
more), but could happen for any strings under builds with
copy-on-write disabled. [perl #123029] <br>

&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123029&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Fixed a bug that
could cause perl to execute an infinite loop during
compilation. [perl #122995]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=122995&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; On Win32,
restoring in a child pseudo-process a variable that was
&quot;local()&quot;ed in a parent pseudo-process before the
&quot;fork&quot; happened caused memory corruption and a
crash in <br>
the child pseudo-process (and therefore OS process). [perl
#40565]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=40565&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Tainted
constants evaluated at compile time no longer cause
unrelated statements to become tainted. [perl #122669]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=122669&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Calling
&quot;write&quot; on a format with a &quot;^**&quot; field
could produce a panic in sv_chop() if there were
insufficient arguments or if the variable used to fill the
field was empty. <br>
[perl #123245]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123245&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; In Perl 5.20.0,
&quot;sort CORE::fake&quot; where &rsquo;fake&rsquo; is
anything other than a keyword started chopping of the last 6
characters and treating the result as a sort sub name. The
<br>
previous behaviour of treating &quot;CORE::fake&quot; as a
sort sub name has been restored. [perl #123410]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123410&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A bug in regular
expression patterns that could lead to segfaults and other
crashes has been fixed. This occurred only in patterns
compiled with &quot;/i&quot;, while taking into <br>
account the current POSIX locale (this usually means they
have to be compiled within the scope of &quot;use
locale&quot;), and there must be a string of at least 128
consecutive bytes <br>
to match. [perl #123539]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123539&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;qr/@array(?{block})/&quot; no longer dies with
&quot;Bizarre copy of ARRAY&quot;. [perl #123344]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123344&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;gmtime&quot; no longer crashes with not-a-number
values. [perl #123495]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123495&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Certain syntax
errors in substitutions, such as
&quot;s/${&lt;&gt;{})//&quot;, would crash, and had done so
since Perl 5.10. (In some cases the crash did not start
happening until Perl <br>
5.16.) The crash has, of course, been fixed. [perl #123542]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123542&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A memory leak in
some regular expressions, introduced in Perl 5.20.1, has
been fixed. [perl #123198]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123198&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;formline(&quot;@...&quot;, &quot;a&quot;);&quot; would
crash. The &quot;FF_CHECKNL&quot; case in pp_formline()
didn&rsquo;t set the pointer used to mark the chop position,
which led to the &quot;FF_MORE&quot; case crashing <br>
with a segmentation fault. This has been fixed. [perl
#123538]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123538&gt;
[perl #123622] <br>

&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123622&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A possible
buffer overrun and crash when parsing a literal pattern
during regular expression compilation has been fixed. [perl
#123604] <br>

&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123604&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Known Problems <br>
&Acirc;&middot; It is a known bug that lexical subroutines
cannot be used as the &quot;SUBNAME&quot; argument to
&quot;sort&quot;. This will be fixed in a future version of
Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Errata From Previous Releases
<br>
&Acirc;&middot; A regression has been fixed that was
introduced in Perl 5.20.0 (fixed in Perl 5.20.1 as well as
here) in which a UTF-8 encoded regular expression pattern
that contains a <br>
single ASCII lowercase letter does not match its uppercase
counterpart. [perl #122655]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=122655&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Acknowledgements <br>

its third decade thanks to a vibrant community of users and
developers. The following people are known to have
contributed the improvements that <br>
became Perl 5.20.2:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The list above is almost
certainly incomplete as it is automatically generated from
version control history. In particular, it does not include
the names of the (very much <br>
appreciated) contributors who reported issues to the Perl
bug tracker.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Many of the changes included in
this version originated in the CPAN modules included in
Perl&rsquo;s core. We&rsquo;re grateful to the entire CPAN
community for helping Perl to flourish.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For a more complete list of all
of Perl&rsquo;s historical contributors, please see the
AUTHORS file in the Perl source distribution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Reporting Bugs <br>
If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the
articles recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc
newsgroup and the perl bug database at https://rt.perl.org/
. There <br>
may also be information at http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl
Home Page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you believe you have an
unreported bug, please run the perlbug program included with
your release. Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case. Your bug <br>
report, along with the output of &quot;perl -V&quot;, will
be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl
porting team.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the bug you are reporting has
security implications, which make it inappropriate to send
to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send it to
<br>
perl5-security-report@perl.org. This points to a closed
subscription unarchived mailing list, which includes all the
core committers, who will be able to help assess the impact
<br>
of issues, figure out a resolution, and help co-ordinate the
release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all
platforms on which Perl is supported. Please only use <br>
this address for security issues in the Perl core, not for
modules independently distributed on CPAN.</p>
