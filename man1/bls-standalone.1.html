<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
bls-standalone - build log scanner, standalone version</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
bls-standalone --help</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bls-standalone [ global options
] check [ --compiledrulesfile rulesfile ] [ --blhc
blhc-program ] logfiles</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bls-standalone [ global options
] compile [ compile-options ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bls-standalone [ global options
] checkout</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
bls-standalone is the command line utility to run the build
log scanner on manually specified logfiles, including
support to manage the needed compiled rules definitions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GLOBAL OPTIONS <br>
Global options can be given before the command, available
options are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options can be specified before
the command. Each affects a different subset of commands and
is ignored by other commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v --verbose <br>
increase verbosity</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--libdir directory <br>
specify the directory where the scan and compile binaries
are looked for</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--sharedir directory <br>
specify the directory where the copy of the rules files and
the packaged precompiled rule data resides.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMANDS <br>
bls-standalone has three commands: check, compile and
checkout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">check [ --compiledrulesfile
rulesfile ] [ --blhc blhc-program ] logfiles <br>
This command runs the bls scanner and the blhc scanner on
the given build log files. If no compiled rules file is
given with --compiledrulesfile then a previously com&acirc;
<br>
piled one is looked for and if there is none than the one
shipped together with the package is used. blhc is also
called if it is found or specified with the --blhcp <br>
option. To silence a warning about it not being found set it
to NO.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">compile [ -o output-file ] [
--no-defaults] [ --ignorecheckout] additional rule
descriptions <br>
Compiles the checks into a compiled form.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unless -o is given to determine
a different place, it is stored in a cache directory
(determined by some environment variables) where the future
check invocations will use <br>
it intsead of the packaged precompiled rules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Additional rule descriptions can
be given as command line arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Rules stored in proper places of
your home directory are looked at, too. (To see where they
are looked for, use --verbose.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unless --no-defaults is given
the contents of a previous checkout or the copy of the rules
shipped with the package are used, too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If there are rules of the same
name, those given as command line arguments override local
and original ones and local ones override original ones.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">checkout <br>
Check out the current rules used for the non-standalone
build scanner into a directory where the next compile run
will use them instead of the shipped rules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Currently this checks out parts
of the QA svn repository. This URL might get outdated in the
future. If the bls-standalone version you use and the
non-standlone bls ver&acirc; <br>
sion get out of sync, those rules might contain things that
your bls-stanalone cannot handle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WRITING RULES <br>
Some far too short guide to writing new description
files:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The non-standalone build log
scanner is only run for builds deemed successful. So checks
for things that should usually make a build fail makes often
not much sense (a test- <br>
suite generating false positives is often more likely than
catching an error ignored inproperly).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The filename is the tag produced
for the test. Finding a good name is often the hardest part
about writing new checks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most of the description file is
actually the html code describing what the finding usually
means to be displayed on
&acirc;&uml;http://qa.debian.org/bls/&acirc;&copy; with the
exception of the lines <br>
starting with ## at the top of the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The description should contain
the following information:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">What did the check found? <br>
Make it easy for people to find what was matched. Makes it
easier to find the issue, less likely to disregard it as
false-positive if it is not, and less time wasting if it
actu&acirc; <br>
ally is a false positive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Why is what is found a problem?
<br>
Even the most serious flaws can easily be disregarded as
minor issues due to ignorance. And some things are only
dangerous in some sitations and don&rsquo;t require the
highest prior&acirc; <br>
ity in other situations. Distingushing both cases is hard
and some more words in the description about it can help a
lot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">What can be done against it?
<br>
Some hints how to avoid the problem both help the one due to
fix it some time looking for a solution. This is especially
useful to help people fixing it properly instead of only
<br>
hiding the problem more thoroughly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The actual ## directives at the
start of the file are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Merge: <br>
This line tells that this check triggers if other checks
appear at the same line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are currently only two
forms supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">##Merge: same tagname1
tagname2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">##Merge: same tagname1 tagname2a
or tagname2b</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Match: <br>
This is a regular expression describing what to match each
line of the build log against to find the issue, prefixed
with regexp:. As an extension to the regular syntax there is
<br>
a atom which specifies that once a line matches up to this
part, no check that does not have a at this place is
supposed to match this line. (This is an optimisation to
<br>
heavily trim down the compile state machine, but it also can
be used to avoid false-positives).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As all regular expressions of
all checks are compiled into a single finite state machine,
checks that are very specific at the start of the line are
quite cheap while checks not <br>
specific at the start are often quite expensive. The size of
the state machine output by the compile command is a good
measurement how expensive the specific check is.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since: <br>
If there are new rules then the information at
&acirc;&uml;http://qa.debian.org/bls/&acirc;&copy; might be
outdated until all logs are rescanned with the new version.
For each log scanned by the non- <br>
standalone build log scanner the version number of the used
rules is remembered. The number specified with the Since
field tells the web report generated where to place warnings
<br>
that information about this check might be outdated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Extract: <br>
This tells how to extract information from the matched file
to be showed together with the matched line (like a filename
something was found in).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are currently following
forms supported here:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">##Extract: simple 0 endcount
&rsquo;endchar&rsquo; <br>
##Extract: simple 0 &rsquo;reset&rsquo; endcount
&rsquo;endchar&rsquo; <br>
##Extract: simple startcount &rsquo;startchar&rsquo;
endcount &rsquo;endchar&rsquo; <br>
##Extract: simple startcount &rsquo;startchar&rsquo;
&rsquo;reset&rsquo; endcount &rsquo;endchar&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Where startchar is a character
to look for for the start of the extracted area (after the
startcountth occurrence). resetchar is a character to abort
extraction. endchar is a <br>
character to look for for the end of the extracted area
(after the endcountth occurrence).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example: <br>
##Extract: simple 2 &rsquo;|&rsquo; &rsquo;/&rsquo; 1
&rsquo;|&rsquo; means to extract the content between the 2nd
and 3rd pipe symbol, unless there is a slash in between.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Action: <br>
describes what to do if a switch is matched. This can be
used to set variables referenced in other rules to generate
context-sensitive rules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Condition: <br>
add conditions (on variables set by ##Action). If the
condition is not met, the generating of a finding is
supressed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CEVEATS <br>
While compiling all matches into a single finite state
machine produces very fast results, it is only feasible
while the state machine does not grow too much. So care has
to be <br>
taken to not use too expensive searches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some checks (especially context
specific ones) are quite unreliable. The non-standalone
build log checks do not include some findings for the
summary unless they appear on mul&acirc; <br>
tiple architectures, which bls-standalone obviously cannot
do.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bls is optimized to be fast. Do
not run it with rules files you do not trust. (Only the
content of log files scanned is supposed to be untrusted
data).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">blhc is quite slow which is
luckily not that noticeable if not scanning the logfiles of
the whole archive. If you test new rules on a larger set of
logfiles, using --blhc=NO can <br>
speed things up quite a bit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">blhc does not report line
numbers so bls-standalone cannot report them for those
findings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that checking the logs of a
dpkg-buildpackage -b run and a dpkg-buildpackage -B run can
make a difference (so if you cannot reproduce a
E-binary-arch-produces-all make sure <br>
you check the correct type of log).</p>
