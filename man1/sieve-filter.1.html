<p>SIEVE-FILTER(1) Pigeonhole SIEVE-FILTER(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
sieve-filter - Pigeonhole&rsquo;s Sieve mailbox filter
tool</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WARNING: This tool is still
experimental. Read this manual carefully, and backup any
important mail before using this tool. Also note that some
of the features documented here <br>
are not actually implemented yet; this is clearly indicated
where applicable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
sieve-filter [options] script-file source-mailbox
[discard-action]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The sieve-filter command is part of the Pigeonhole Project
(pigeonhole(7)), which adds Sieve (RFC 5228) support to the
Dovecot secure IMAP and POP3 server (dovecot(1)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Sieve language was
originally meant for filtering messages upon delivery.
However, there are occasions when it is desirable to filter
messages that are already stored in a <br>
mailbox, for instance when a bug in a Sieve script caused
many messages to be delivered incorrectly. Using the
sieve-filter tool it is possible to apply a Sieve script on
all <br>
messages in a particular source-mailbox, making it possible
to delete messages, to store them in a different mailbox, to
change their content, and to change the assigned IMAP <br>
flags and keywords. Attempts to send messages to the outside
world are ignored by default for obvious reasons, but, using
the proper command line options, it is possible to
cap&acirc; <br>
ture and handle outgoing mail as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no options are specified, the
sieve-filter command runs in a simulation mode in which it
only prints what would be performed, without actually doing
anything. Use the -e <br>
option to activate true script execution. Also, the
source-mailbox is opened read-only by default, meaning that
it normally always remains unchanged. Use the -W option to
allow <br>
changes in the source-mailbox.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Even with the -W option enabled,
messages in the source-mailbox are only potentially modified
or moved to a different folder. Messages are never lost
unless a discard-action <br>
argument other than keep (the default) is specified. If the
Sieve filter decides to store the message in the
source-mailbox, where it obviously already exists, it is
never dupli&acirc; <br>
cated there. In that case, the IMAP flags of the original
message can be modified by the Sieve interpreter using the
imap4flags extension, provided that -W is specified. If the
<br>
message itself is modified by the Sieve interpreter (e.g.
using the editheader extension), a new message is stored and
the old one is expunged. However, if -W is omitted, the <br>
original message is left untouched and the modifications are
discarded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CAUTION <br>
Although this is a very useful tool, it can also be very
destructive when used improperly. A small bug in your Sieve
script in combination with the wrong command line options
<br>
could cause it to discard the wrong e-mails. And, even if
the source-mailbox is opened in read-only mode to prevent
such mishaps, it can still litter other mailboxes with
spuri&acirc; <br>
ous copies of your e-mails if your Sieve script decides to
do so. Therefore, users are advised to read this manual
carefully and to use the simulation mode first to check what
<br>
the script will do. And, of course:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MAKING A BACKUP IS IMPERATIVE
FOR ANY IMPORTANT MAIL!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-c config-file <br>
Alternative Dovecot configuration file path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C Force compilation. By
default, the compiled binary is stored on disk. When this
binary is found during the next execution of sieve-filter
and its modification time is more <br>
recent than the script file, it is used and the script is
not compiled again. This option forces the script to be
compiled, thus ignoring any present binary. Refer to <br>
sievec(1) for more information about Sieve compilation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D Enable Sieve debugging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e Turns on execution mode. By
default, the sieve-filter command runs in simulation mode in
which it changes nothing, meaning that no mailbox is altered
in any way and no <br>
actions are performed. It only prints what would be done.
Using this option, the sieve-filter command becomes active
and performs the requested actions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m default-mailbox <br>
The mailbox where the (implicit) keep Sieve action stores
messages. This is equal to the source-mailbox by default.
Specifying a different folder will have the effect of <br>
moving (or copying if -W is omitted) all kept messages to
the indicated folder, instead of just leaving them in the
source-mailbox. Refer to the explanation of the <br>
source-mailbox argument for more information on mailbox
naming.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q output-mailbox [not
implemented yet] <br>
Store outgoing e-mail into the indicated output-mailbox. By
default, the sieve-filter command ignores Sieve actions such
as redirect, reject, vacation and notify, but <br>
using this option outgoing messages can be appended to the
indicated mailbox. This option has no effect in simulation
mode. Flags of redirected messages are not preserved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Q mail-command [not implemented
yet] <br>
Send outgoing e-mail (e.g. as produced by redirect, reject
and vacation) through the specified program. By default, the
sieve-filter command ignores Sieve actions such as <br>
redirect, reject, vacation and notify, but using this option
outgoing messages can be fed to the stdin of an external
shell command. This option has no effect in simula&acirc;
<br>
tion mode. Unless you really know what you are doing, DO NOT
USE THIS TO FEED MAIL TO SENDMAIL!.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s script-file [not implemented
yet] <br>
Specify additional scripts to be executed before the main
script. Multiple -s arguments are allowed and the specified
scripts are executed sequentially in the order speci&acirc;
<br>
fied at the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u user <br>
Run the Sieve script for the given user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Produce verbose output during
filtering.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-W Enables write access to the
source-mailbox. This allows (re)moving the messages from the
source-mailbox, changing their contents, and changing the
assigned IMAP flags and <br>
keywords.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x extensions <br>
Set the available extensions. The parameter is a
space-separated list of the active extensions. By prepending
the extension identifiers with + or -, extensions can be
<br>
included or excluded relative to the configured set of
active extensions. If no extensions have a + or - prefix,
only those extensions that are explicitly listed will be
<br>
enabled. Unknown extensions are ignored and a warning is
produced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example -x &quot;+imapflags
-enotify&quot; will enable the deprecated imapflags
extension and disable the enotify extension. The rest of the
active extensions depends on the <br>
sieve_extensions and sieve_global_extensions settings. By
default, i.e. when sieve_extensions and
sieve_global_extensions remain unconfigured, all supported
extensions <br>
are available, except for deprecated extensions or those
that are still under development.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ARGUMENTS <br>
script-file <br>
Specifies the Sieve script to (compile and) execute.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that this tool looks for a
pre-compiled binary file with a .svbin extension and with
basename and path identical to the specified script. Use the
-C option to disable <br>
this behavior by forcing the script to be compiled into a
new binary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">source-mailbox <br>
Specifies the source mailbox containing the messages that
the Sieve filter will act upon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is the name of a mailbox,
as visible to IMAP clients, except in UTF-8 format. The
hierarchy separator between a parent and child mailbox is
commonly &rsquo;/&rsquo; or &rsquo;.&rsquo;, but <br>
this depends on your selected mailbox storage format and
namespace configuration. The mailbox names may also require
a namespace prefix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This mailbox is not modified
unless the -W option is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">discard-action <br>
Specifies what is done with messages in the source-mailbox
that where not kept or otherwise stored by the Sieve script;
i.e. those messages that would normally be dis&acirc; <br>
carded if the Sieve script were executed at delivery. The
discard-action parameter accepts one of the following
values:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">keep (default) <br>
Keep discarded messages in source mailbox.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">move mailbox <br>
Move discarded messages to the indicated mailbox. This is
for instance useful to move messages to a Trash mailbox.
Refer to the explanation of the source-mailbox <br>
argument for more information on mailbox naming.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">delete Flag discarded messages
as TED.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">expunge <br>
Expunge discarded messages, meaning that these are removed
irreversibly when the tool finishes filtering.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the -W option is not
specified, the source-mailbox is immutable and the specified
discard-action has no effect. This means that messages are
at most copied to a new <br>
location. In contrast, when the -W is specified, messages
that are successfully stored somewhere else by the Sieve
script are always expunged from the source-mailbox, with
<br>
the effect that these are thus moved to the new location.
This happens irrespective of the specified discard-action.
Remember: only discarded messages are affected by the <br>
specified discard-action.</p>
