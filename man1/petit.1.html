<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
petit - log analysis tool for systems administrators</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
petit [OPTION] [FILE]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
petit was developed to quickly analyze syslog and Apache log
files in large environments. It can also be used for word
discovery within log data. It is a general purpose tool <br>
that can do hashing, word counts, and command line graphing
of Apache and syslog files. It is designed to be a standard
Unix tool that can be employed with pipes or by opening <br>
files. Petit works by sifting data with standard patterns
and allows for custom filters and fingerprints. This leaves
the analyst with data that is both varied and
interesting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILE can be Syslog, Apache
Access, Apache Error, Snort or Raw log files. Petit can also
be used to analyze any type of file as a Raw log file, but
since time/date is not under&acirc; <br>
stood, they cannot be graphed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-h, --help <br>
Displays simple usage message</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
Adds verbose output to any function</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--sample <br>
Sample any line for which there are 3 or less entries
found</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--allsample <br>
Show samples for all lines found</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--filter <br>
Force filter files to be used during processing because some
functions do not filter by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--nofilter <br>
Force filter files to be skipped during processing. This
will work for any function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--wide Make graphing wider for
bigger screens</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--tick=&quot;%&quot; <br>
Change tick character from default of &quot;#&quot;. This
can be any single character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--finterprint <br>
Use fingerprinting to remove certain patterns from analysis.
By default this is off for most or all functions. This is a
safety feature to prevent an analyst from removing <br>
data without using an explicit switch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
Display the version of petit and exit</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--hash This is one of the most
basic functions of petit. This function tallies lines found.
Each output line displays the number of similar lines found
in the log and what the <br>
group generally looked like. If filtering is used in
conjunction with hashing then numbers and patterns which are
commonly found and not profoundly necessary are removed <br>
from the input stream. This leaves the analyst with
approximate log entries as opposed to actual log entries.
This is useful for analyzing large log sets commonly found
in <br>
clusters/pools of servers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--wordcount <br>
Word counting is essentially like hashing except that data
is grouped by word instead of line. A custom stopwords list
is used to filter out common words found in the eng&acirc;
<br>
lish language. A common use case for this function would be
word discovery. When used in connection with grep or swatch,
word counting can be used to enumarate all of the <br>
words found in a log file which have similar meanings, such
as &quot;error, can&rsquo;t, fail, reject&quot;, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is extremely useful for
giving confidence when building white lists and black lists.
These lists can then be used for daily reporting or graphing
for anamoly detec&acirc; <br>
tion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--daemon <br>
Gives a simple report of lines produced, keyed by the daemon
that produced them</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--host Gives a simple report of
lines produced, keyed by the host that produced them. This
can be useful for analyzing machines in a cluster dedicated
to the same task. If one <br>
machine is producing too much or too little log output there
is generally a problem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GRAPHS <br>
Graphs are displayed with the following information to help
analyze the log file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--sgraph <br>
Show a graph of first 60 seconds of the log file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--mgraph <br>
Show a graph of first 60 minutes of the log file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--hgraph <br>
Show a graph of first 24 hours of the log file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dgraph <br>
Show a graph of first 31 days of the log file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--mograph <br>
Show a graph of first 12 months of the log file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ygraph <br>
Show a graph of first 10 years. 10 years was chosen
arbitrarily and could be changed in the code if more time is
needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/usr/share/petit/fingerprint_library <br>
Fingerprint library which can be used to construct custom
fingerprint files. They are in the same format as
petit&rsquo;s output so it is easy to construct new
fingerprints.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/usr/share/petit/fingerprints
<br>
Aggregate fingerprint files which can be used to filter out
reboots and other events which the administrator does not
care to see</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/usr/share/petit/filters/ <br>
Each function has a separate list of words and patterns
which are removed. Each list is stored in a designated file
and specified with standard regular expression format.</p>
