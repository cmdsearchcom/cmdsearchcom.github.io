PERL5241DELTA(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
perl5241delta - what is new for perl v5.24.1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This document describes differences between the 5.24.0
release and the 5.24.1 release.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are upgrading from an
earlier release such as 5.22.0, first read perl5240delta,
which describes differences between 5.22.0 and 5.24.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Security <br>
-Di switch is now required for PerlIO debugging output <br>
Previously PerlIO debugging output would be sent to the file
specified by the &quot;PERLIO_DEBUG&quot; environment
variable if perl wasn&rsquo;t running setuid and the -T or
-t switches hadn&rsquo;t <br>
been parsed yet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If perl performed output at a
point where it hadn&rsquo;t yet parsed its switches this
could result in perl creating or overwriting the file named
by &quot;PERLIO_DEBUG&quot; even when the -T <br>
switch had been supplied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl now requires the -Di switch
to produce PerlIO debugging output. By default this is
written to &quot;stderr&quot;, but can optionally be
redirected to a file by setting the <br>
&quot;PERLIO_DEBUG&quot; environment variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If perl is running setuid or the
-T switch was supplied &quot;PERLIO_DEBUG&quot; is ignored
and the debugging output is sent to &quot;stderr&quot; as
for any other -D switch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Core modules and tools no longer
search &quot;.&quot; for optional modules <br>
The tools and many modules supplied in core no longer search
the default current directory entry in @INC for optional
modules. For example, Storable will remove the final
&quot;.&quot; <br>
from @INC before trying to load Log::Agent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This prevents an attacker
injecting an optional module into a process run by another
user where the current directory is writable by the
attacker, e.g. the /tmp directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In most cases this removal
should not cause problems, but difficulties were encountered
with base, which treats every module name supplied as
optional. These difficulties have <br>
not yet been resolved, so for this release there are no
changes to base. We hope to have a fix for base in Perl
5.24.2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To protect your own code from
this attack, either remove the default &quot;.&quot; entry
from @INC at the start of your script, so:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#!/usr/bin/perl <br>
use strict; <br>
...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">becomes:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#!/usr/bin/perl <br>
BEGIN { pop @INC if $INC[-1] eq &rsquo;.&rsquo; } <br>
use strict; <br>
...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or for modules, remove
&quot;.&quot; from a localized @INC, so:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">my $can_foo = eval { require
Foo; }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">becomes:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">my $can_foo = eval { <br>
local @INC = @INC; <br>
pop @INC if $INC[-1] eq &rsquo;.&rsquo;; <br>
require Foo; <br>
};</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Incompatible Changes <br>
Other than the security changes above there are no changes
intentionally incompatible with Perl 5.24.0. If any exist,
they are bugs, and we request that you submit a report. <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Documentation <br>
Changes to Existing Documentation <br>
perlapio</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The
documentation of &quot;PERLIO_DEBUG&quot; has been
updated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perlrun</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The new -Di
switch has been documented, and the documentation of
&quot;PERLIO_DEBUG&quot; has been updated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Testing <br>
&Acirc;&middot; A new test script, t/run/switchDx.t, has
been added to test that the new -Di switch is working
correctly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Selected Bug Fixes <br>
&Acirc;&middot; The change to hashbang redirection
introduced in Perl 5.24.0, whereby perl would redirect to
another interpreter (Perl 6) if it found a hashbang path
which contains &quot;perl&quot; <br>
followed by &quot;6&quot;, has been reverted because it
broke in cases such as
&quot;#!/opt/perl64/bin/perl&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Acknowledgements <br>
Perl 5.24.1 represents approximately 8 months of development
since Perl 5.24.0 and contains approximately 8,100 lines of
changes across 240 files from 18 authors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Excluding auto-generated files,
documentation and release tools, there were approximately
2,200 lines of changes to 170 .pm, .t, .c and .h files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl continues to flourish into
its third decade thanks to a vibrant community of users and
developers. The following people are known to have
contributed the improvements that <br>
became Perl 5.24.1:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The list above is almost
certainly incomplete as it is automatically generated from
version control history. In particular, it does not include
the names of the (very much <br>
appreciated) contributors who reported issues to the Perl
bug tracker.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Many of the changes included in
this version originated in the CPAN modules included in
