<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
rcs2atfs - convert RCS archives to AtFS format</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
rcs2atfs [-o outputfile] [ -q] archive ... <br>
rcs2atfs [-o outputfile] [ -q] -R directory ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Rcs2atfs converts version histories from RCS archives to
ShapeTools&rsquo; AtFS format. It uses rlog(1) to get
information about an RCS archive and issues shell commands
(usually <br>
through a pipe directly to /bin/sh) to check out the RCS
revisions and check the files in as AtFS versions, trying to
keep as many attributes as possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The RCS archives are left
unchanged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is recommended to create a
special directory with the name RCS for the RCS archives,
but AtFS histories are always kept in a special directory
AtFS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Rcs2atfs treats its arguments as
names of RCS archives. These can be the names of the archive
files themselves, ending with ,v, or the names of the files
stored in the archives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -R option is given, the
arguments are interpreted as directory names. Rcs2atfs
recursively descends each directory tree (symbolic links are
followed) and converts the RCS <br>
archives it finds. The correspondig AtFS archives are
created where the RCS archives are found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Rcs2atfs tries to keep the
revision numbers of the RCS history also as AtFS version
numbers. This is impossible if an RCS history contains
branches. In this case the revisions <br>
are saved as AtFS versions in the order of their check-in
date. In either case the RCS revision number is kept as a
symbolic name for the corresponding AtFS version, e.g. the
<br>
AtFS version of RCS revision 1.2 will have the symbolic name
&lsquo;&lsquo;r1.2&rsquo;&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Attributes that don&rsquo;t
change: <br>
&Acirc;&middot; <br>
author</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; <br>
log message</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; <br>
comment leader</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; <br>
symbolic names (with the exception of the additional
symbolic name derived from the RCS revision number)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other attributes: <br>
mtime set to the check-in date of the RCS revision</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">state The value of this
attribute is given to the AtFS attribute RCSstate. If it has
the value Exp, the state of the AtFS version will be saved,
if Stab, it will be proposed, <br>
if Rel, it will be published.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-R (recursive) <br>
The arguments are treated as directories. Rcs2atfs
recursively descends the directory tree (symbolic links are
followed) and builds an AtFS archive for each RCS archive
<br>
it finds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o outputfile <br>
rcs2atfs writes shell commands to outputfile, not directly
to /bin/sh, and no conversion is done. If this shell script
is executed from the directory where rcs2atfs was <br>
invoked, the archives are converted as if rcs2atfs had been
invoked without -o. <br>
The main use of this option is to investigate problems with
the conversion of archives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q (quiet) <br>
The names and revision numbers of converted archives are not
echoed on standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
The command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rcs2atfs -R
$HOME/development</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">traverses the directory tree
$HOME/development and converts every RCS archive in it into
an AtFS archive. During the conversion, the name of every
RCS archive and every revision <br>
number is echoed on standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rcs2atfs -q RCS/*</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each archive in the RCS
directory is converted to an AtFS history. The names and
revision numbers of the converted archives are not
echoed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
sh(1), rcsintro(1), rcs(1), rlog(1), co(1), vcintro(1),
save(1), vadm(1), utime(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
Warnings <br>
-R flag not set, directory skipped <br>
If the -R flag is not set, directories given as arguments in
the command line are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">locked version(s) exist <br>
A revision of the specified RCS history is locked. This is
not really a problem, but perhaps rcs2atfs does not convert
the most recent version of the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">branches exist, can&rsquo;t keep
revision numbers <br>
If the RCS history contains branches, the numbers of AtFS
versions cannot be the same as those of the corresponding
RCS revisions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">symbolic name to non-existent
revision <br>
rlog has reported a symbolic name of a revision that does
not exist in this archive. Probably this never happens (I
don&rsquo;t know), but if, the symbolic name is ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Errors <br>
ATFS history exists, file skipped <br>
The specified file is already known to AtFS as a history or
a busy version. This file will nor be converted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">colon after symbolic name
missing, file skipped <br>
revision not found, file skipped <br>
date not found, file skipped <br>
author not found, file skipped <br>
status not found, file skipped <br>
rlog information missing, file skipped</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These messages indicate problems
with the rlog output, perhaps an old rlog version is used.
(rcs2atfs works correctly with rlog version 5.5.) <br>
The specified file will not be converted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rlog command failed, file
skipped <br>
For some unknown reason rlog returned a non-zero exit
status. rlog should have provided an explanatory
message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fatal Errors <br>
popen to rlog command failed <br>
The rlog command could not be invoked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">popen to shell failed <br>
The shell could not be invoked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">no more core <br>
Rcs2atfs could not allocate enough memory. The amount of
memory in your machine should be increased.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Internal Errors <br>
Oops? Unknown reader state in readin_rcsfile! <br>
revision numbers corrupted <br>
number of revisions is wrong!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You should never see these error
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CAVEATS <br>
If rcs2atfs visits the same RCS archive twice (e.g. because
a symbolic link is followed to a directory which is also
accessed directly), the check for existing AtFS archives may
<br>
be done a second time before the conversion commands from
the first visit are executed by the shell. This results in
lots of annoying messages and duplicate AtFS versions of RCS
<br>
revisions. To avoid this, make sure that rcs2atfs
doesn&rsquo;t reach a directory twice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Rcs2atfs is rather slow since it invokes a shell command for
every action.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Attribute citations in files are
not translated from RCS to AtFS (e.g. &lsquo;&lsquo;$Header:
... $&rsquo;&rsquo; to
&lsquo;&lsquo;$__Header$&rsquo;&rsquo;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Rcs2atfs strongly relies on the
format of rlog&rsquo;s output. Since I don&rsquo;t know any
other rlog than our version (5.5), it may fail to work with
other versions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Due to the lack of serious RCS
archives, rcs2atfs isn&rsquo;t thoroughly tested yet. (Well,
we use ShapeTools. :-)</p>
