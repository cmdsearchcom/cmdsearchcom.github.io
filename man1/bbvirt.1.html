<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The bbvirt program is an attempt to take some of the pain
out of what is currently required to distribute multiple USB
devices between the host and guest virtual machines. While
<br>
there are several ways in which this may be configured and
managed, at present none of them actually provide a complete
and coherent solution on their own, all of them fall short
<br>
of the mark in some significant and annoying way. The aim
here is to piece together enough of those hacks to actually
get all of the functionality that we want now, until the
<br>
libvirt native support for this improves enough to not need
it anymore.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At present this deals with
libvirt managed QEMU/KVM virtual machines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">What do we want? <br>
The ideal behaviour here is pretty simple. Given some
arbitrary number of BitBabbler devices, we should be able to
assign them to either the host machine, or to a guest VM
run&acirc; <br>
ning on it, and once we do that they should behave in the
normal manner expected of any USB device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- If they are plugged in when
the guest machine is started, they should be seen by that
machine as they would be by the host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- If they are plugged in after
the machine is started, they should be hotplugged into that
machine as they would be on the host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- If they are unplugged while
the machine is running, they should be cleanly removed from
it, as they would be on the host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Why can&rsquo;t we have it? <br>
Right now, libvirt gives us two ways that we can assign USB
devices from the host to a guest domain.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- We can assign them by their
USB vendor and product ID. But that only works when there is
just a single device of that type in the host. Which is
pretty useless in most of the <br>
cases that we care about here, where the host and each of
the guests are likely to have one or more BitBabbler devices
of their own assigned to them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- We can assign them by their
logical address on the USB bus. But that isn&rsquo;t a
constant that we can statically configure for the domain.
Every time a device is plugged in, or <br>
replugged, or reset, or the host machine is rebooted, that
address is likely to change since it is dynamically
allocated when the device is enumerated on the bus.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is a third way, but it
relies on bypassing the normal libvirt configuration to make
direct use of the QEMU ability to assign a device by its
physical address on the bus. <br>
Which is better, but still not a magic bullet since it
relies on plugging exactly the same devices into exactly the
same ports every time (and on having those ports enumerated
in <br>
the same way by the host on every reboot, which isn&rsquo;t
guaranteed either). It also forces us to jump through other
hoops, since we then need additional complication to manage
the <br>
access permissions of the device manually outside of
libvirt, but still in coordination with it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The even bigger failing, which
all of those methods have in common, is they all depend on
the device already being plugged in before the guest is
started. If it is inserted <br>
after the guest is started, or removed and replugged while
the guest is running, or if the host bus or a hub bounces
causing a reconnect, then the device will not be
(re)attached <br>
to the guest. The only way to fix that if it happens is to
manually reattach the device with an arcane incantation in
XML (which relies on you knowing the new address of the <br>
device), or to completely power down and restart the guest.
Not the pinnacle of user-friendly operation that we are
looking for here.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">What can we do about it? <br>
There was a patch submitted to libvirt some years back which
would have allowed a device to be specified by both its USB
product ID and its serial number, but that got some push-
<br>
back, and so far has still not been applied upstream. That
would have gone a long way toward making this both easy and
clean, leaving us only with the hotplug aspect to deal <br>
with. We&rsquo;ll leave grumpy snark about that as an
exercise for the reader ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another alternative is we can
delegate finding the device&rsquo;s logical address to a
hotplug manager like udev(7). This is attractive in the
sense that we can know when the address <br>
of a device changes and what it changes to, but udev itself
isn&rsquo;t very friendly to the idea of local admin
customisation (while it is possible to do, it seems to be
getting <br>
increasingly strongly discouraged) and using it still
requires some external glue to translate its events into
something that libvirt can act on to configure the guest
machine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The bbvirt program provides that
glue, and a user friendly method of assigning which devices
should belong to which guest domains, and a front end that
can be invoked manually or <br>
by other admin controlled tasks to quickly and easily add or
remove BitBabbler devices from any of the running guest
machines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">But the limitation this approach
has, is that it can&rsquo;t easily know when a guest machine
is started which should have devices that are already
plugged in added to it. In theory <br>
we could add them to its persistent domain definition, but
that has its own problems because we can only add devices by
their ephemeral logical address, and we can&rsquo;t
guarantee <br>
that we will get called to remove them from the domain again
when that address becomes invalid (like if the host is
suddenly powered off or it is otherwise not cleanly shut
<br>
down), so we could end up with many stale entries
accumulating in the persistent domain configuration, which
could later match some completely different device to what
we had <br>
wanted attached to it. Which means until that somehow gets
fixed, it&rsquo;s only safe to add them to a live guest
domain, so that they will always be removed again when it is
halted, <br>
no matter how it ended up getting halted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Clearly we&rsquo;ve still got
some way to go to get to our ideal here.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">What if we hit it with *two*
hammers? <br>
There appears to be only two ways that we can get notified
of a guest machine being started at present. One involves
running yet another daemon process, which would do little
<br>
more than just sit around waiting for someone to start a
guest so it could tell us about that. But then we&rsquo;d
have yet another thing to configure, yet another process
running, <br>
and yet more problems with figuring out how to ensure we
don&rsquo;t lose a race when the host is booted, between
getting the initial set of device events, that process being
ready and <br>
active, and any guests that will be autostarted at boot
actually starting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The other way is to use a
libvirt hook. Which in turn has the problem of not actually
allowing us to run any libvirt functions from it, which we
need to do in order to attach <br>
the device to the host. And which we can&rsquo;t guarantee
that we can just install by default, because there can be
only one such hook on the system, which the local admin may
<br>
already be using ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is a third way, but that
would involve requiring the local admin to start all guest
machines through a wrapper of our own, instead of via
whatever mechanism they already <br>
know and use. Which doesn&rsquo;t scale to support other USB
devices in the same situation, among the many ways that
would be a horrible solution to inflict on people.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">But there is a loophole we can
exploit. We can use the libvirt qemu hook to trigger a
change event for udev, which can in turn invoke bbvirt in
much the same way that would hap&acirc; <br>
pen if the device was really hotplugged, which gives us the
extra layer of indirection we need to be able to safely do
that from the hook. Rube Goldberg would be proud, and some
<br>
of the pieces may require hand-assembly, but with all of
this in place, we can have something resembling normal USB
functionality in the guest machines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It&rsquo;s not pretty, but it
will work with what we have to work with.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ok, just tell me where to hit
it. <br>
To string this together, you&rsquo;ll need to ensure all of
the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- The udev(7) rules from the
bit-babbler package are installed. If you installed this
from the Debian packages that should already be done. If you
didn&rsquo;t, you will need to <br>
install the rules that are found in debian/bit-babbler.udev
from the source package to a suitable place on your system
(probably /etc/udev/rules.d).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- The bbvirt(1) script is
installed in a place where the udev rules will find it. If
you didn&rsquo;t install this from the Debian packages, and
it isn&rsquo;t in /usr/bin, then you&rsquo;ll need <br>
to tweak the udev rules to suit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- The devices you wish to use in
guest machines, and the machines you wish to use them in,
are specified in the bbvirt configuration file. The default
location for that is <br>
/etc/bit-babbler/vm.conf. If you wish to use a different
file you will need to pass its location with the --config
option in the udev rules, and update the hook script use
<br>
that file too. The details of what you can put in that file
are described in the CONFIGURATION OPTIONS section
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- The libvirt hook file is
installed. If all the above is done, then devices will be
added to the running guest machines if they get plugged in
while the guest is running. This <br>
last step ensures devices which are already plugged in will
be added to newly started guests too (which includes guests
that are started automatically when the host machine <br>
boots).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Until there is some safe way we
can install this without conflicting with or overwriting an
existing hook, everyone will need to do this step manually.
If you have installed <br>
the Debian packages, then the example hook script that
we&rsquo;ve provided for this can be found in
/usr/share/doc/bit-babbler/examples/qemu-hook. If you
didn&rsquo;t it can be found in <br>
libvirt/qemu-hook of the source package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You will need to install that
file as /etc/libvirt/hooks/qemu, or merge its content with
the existing qemu file there if you already have that hook
set. If that file did not <br>
previously exist, you will need to restart libvirtd(8) to
get it to begin using it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">That should cover all of the
needed automation, but you can also attach and detach
devices manually at any time too. The details of doing that
will be described in the following <br>
section. Otherwise, with all the above done, there is no
other reason to need to invoke bbvirt directly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
There are two primary modes of operation for bbvirt which
are selected by the initial action option. If the action to
perform is attach or detach then only a single device will
<br>
be acted upon, and which device that should be must be
specified explicitly, even if there is only one device
present on the host at the time. When invoking bbvirt
manually, the <br>
device may be specified by its serial number, its logical
address on the bus (in the form busnum:devnum, given as
decimal integers), or its physical address on the bus (in
the <br>
form busnum-port[.port ...]).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the action to perform is
attach-all or detach-all, then the device(s) to act upon are
selected by domain association instead. If a domain is
explicitly specified, then all <br>
devices which are assigned to that guest domain in the
configuration file will be acted upon in the same way as if
bbvirt was invoked for each of them individually with the
<br>
attach or detach action. If no domain is provided, then all
of the configured guest domains will be acted upon in this
way.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following additional options
are available:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C, --config <br>
Specify an alternative configuration file to import the
device assignments from. If the path to the file is not
provided explicitly, then it will be looked for in the <br>
/etc/bit-babbler directory (with a .conf suffix).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --connect=URI <br>
Specify the virsh(1) connection URI to use. This will
override a DOMAIN_URI set for the domain in the
configuration file. If that is not set using either of these
meth&acirc; <br>
ods then the virsh default for the user running bbvirt will
be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D, --domain=name <br>
Specify the libvirt domain to act upon. This may be used to
override the device allocation from the configuration file
when bbvirt is invoked manually, or to act on a <br>
device or domain that is not currently specified in the
configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b, --busnum=num <br>
Specify the USB bus number that the device is attached to.
This option is mostly used to avoid bbvirt needing to look
this up when it is already known (such as when it is <br>
called from a udev rule). There isn&rsquo;t usually much
reason to pass this if invoking bbvirt manually, since you
can just specify the device by its logical or physical <br>
address instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --devnum=num <br>
Specify the USB device number that the device is currently
assigned. Together with the bus number, this forms the
logical address of the device. This option is mostly <br>
used to avoid bbvirt needing to look this up when it is
already known (such as when it is called from a udev rule).
There isn&rsquo;t usually much reason to pass this if
invok&acirc; <br>
ing bbvirt manually, since you can just specify the device
by its logical address instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --dry-run <br>
Don&rsquo;t attach or detach any devices, just show what
would be attempted if this was a live run. This option
implies a minimal level of --verbose, but the verbosity may
be <br>
increased further by also passing that option
explicitly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
Make more noise about what is really going on. It may be
passed multiple times to increase the verbosity further.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-?, --help <br>
Show a brief summary of the available options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION OPTIONS <br>
The bbvirt configuration file contains variable assignments
using the bash(1) shell syntax. It is sourced as a shell
snippet, so you could in principle construct the
configura&acirc; <br>
tion for each domain dynamically, but most typically a
simple static assignment of devices to domains will suffice.
If you do elect to run code in it, you should be very
defen&acirc; <br>
sive about namespacing any other variables you use, or any
other side effects you might cause to happen. Any number of
guest domains may be configured in it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For each guest domain, two
variables control the behaviour of bbvirt:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DOMAIN_URI_domain=URI <br>
This variable is optional, and sets the virsh(1) connection
URI to use when attaching or detaching devices from the
given domain. If the --connect option is explicitly <br>
passed to bbvirt it will override what is set here. If the
connection URI is not set using either of these methods then
the virsh default for the user running bbvirt will <br>
be used (which would normally be root if run from udev).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DOMAIN_RNG_domain=( device
serial numbers ... ) <br>
This variable is required if automatic passthrough of
devices to a domain is desired. It is a bash array,
populated with a space separated list of all the device
serial <br>
numbers that you want assigned to domain. It is not an error
for devices to be listed here which are not currently
plugged in. It is important to ensure that devices are <br>
only assigned to one domain though, and that devices
assigned to guest domains will not be used by a seedd(1)
instance running on the host (which means the seedd
configu&acirc; <br>
ration needs to be passed an explicit list of the devices
that it may use too).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The device serial number must
always be used here. You cannot specify a device by its
logical or physical address on the bus (like you can in most
other places where we <br>
take a device ID).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/etc/bit-babbler/vm.conf <br>
The default configuration file for assigning BitBabbler
devices to libvirt managed virtual machine domains.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">/lib/udev/rules.d/60-bit-babbler.rules
<br>
The default udev(7) rules granting direct device access to
users in the group bit-babbler, enabling USB autosuspend
when the device is idle, and invoking bbvirt to handle <br>
device hotplug for virtual machines. These can be overridden
by creating /etc/udev/rules.d/60-bit-babbler.rules and
populating it with your own rules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/libvirt/hooks/qemu <br>
The libvirt hook script needed to enable cold-plugging of
already present devices into newly (re)started virtual
machines.</p>
