The <b>bbvirt</b> program is an attempt to take some of the pain out of what is
  currently required to distribute multiple USB devices between the host and
  guest virtual machines. While there are several ways in which this may be
  configured and managed, at present none of them actually provide a complete
  and coherent solution on their own, all of them fall short of the mark in some
  significant and annoying way. The aim here is to piece together enough of
  those hacks to actually get all of the functionality that we want now, until
  the libvirt native support for this improves enough to not need it anymore.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
At present this deals with libvirt managed QEMU/KVM virtual machines.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="What_do_we_want?"><a class="selflink" href="#What_do_we_want?">What
  do we want?</a></h2>
The ideal behaviour here is pretty simple. Given some arbitrary number of
  BitBabbler devices, we should be able to assign them to either the host
  machine, or to a guest VM running on it, and once we do that they should
  behave in the normal manner expected of any USB device.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">-</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If they are plugged in when the guest machine is started,
      they should be seen by that machine as they would be by the host.

</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">-</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If they are plugged in after the machine is started, they

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
  </dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">-</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If they are unplugged while the machine is running, they
      should be cleanly removed from it, as they would be on the host.

  can't we have it?</a></h2>
Right now, libvirt gives us two ways that we can assign USB devices from the
  host to a guest domain.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">-</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">We can assign them by their USB vendor and product ID. But
      that only works when there is just a single device of that type in the
      host. Which is pretty useless in most of the cases that we care about
      here, where the host and each of the guests are likely to have one or more
      BitBabbler devices of their own assigned to them.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
  </dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">-</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">We can assign them by their logical address on the USB bus.
      But that isn't a constant that we can statically configure for the domain.
      Every time a device is plugged in, or replugged, or reset, or the host
      machine is rebooted, that address is likely to change since it is
      dynamically allocated when the device is enumerated on the bus.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
There is a third way, but it relies on bypassing the normal libvirt
  configuration to make direct use of the QEMU ability to assign a device by its
  physical address on the bus. Which is better, but still not a magic bullet
  since it relies on plugging exactly the same devices into exactly the same
  ports every time (and on having those ports enumerated in the same way by the
  host on every reboot, which isn't guaranteed either). It also forces us to
  jump through other hoops, since we then need additional complication to manage
  the access permissions of the device manually outside of libvirt, but still in
  coordination with it.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The even bigger failing, which all of those methods have in common, is they all
  depend on the device already being plugged in before the guest is started. If
  it is inserted after the guest is started, or removed and replugged while the
  guest is running, or if the host bus or a hub bounces causing a reconnect,
  then the device will not be (re)attached to the guest. The only way to fix
  that if it happens is to manually reattach the device with an arcane
  incantation in XML (which relies on you knowing the new address of the
  device), or to completely power down and restart the guest. Not the pinnacle
  of user-friendly operation that we are looking for here.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="What_can_we_do_about_it?"><a class="selflink" href="#What_can_we_do_about_it?">What
  can we do about it?</a></h2>
There was a patch submitted to libvirt some years back which would have allowed
  a device to be specified by both its USB product ID and its serial number, but
  that got some push-back, and so far has still not been applied upstream. That
  would have gone a long way toward making this both easy and clean, leaving us
  only with the hotplug aspect to deal with. We'll leave grumpy snark about that
  as an exercise for the reader&#x00A0;...
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Another alternative is we can delegate finding the device's logical address to a
  hotplug manager like <b>udev</b>(7). This is attractive in the sense that we
  can know when the address of a device changes and what it changes to, but
  <b>udev</b> itself isn't very friendly to the idea of local admin
  customisation (while it is possible to do, it seems to be getting increasingly
  strongly discouraged) and using it still requires some external glue to
  translate its events into something that libvirt can act on to configure the
  guest machine.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The <b>bbvirt</b> program provides that glue, and a user friendly method of
  assigning which devices should belong to which guest domains, and a front end
  that can be invoked manually or by other admin controlled tasks to quickly and
  easily add or remove BitBabbler devices from any of the running guest
  machines.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
But the limitation this approach has, is that it can't easily know when a guest
  machine is started which should have devices that are already plugged in added
  to it. In theory we could add them to its persistent domain definition, but
  that has its own problems because we can only add devices by their ephemeral
  logical address, and we can't guarantee that we will get called to remove them
  from the domain again when that address becomes invalid (like if the host is
  suddenly powered off or it is otherwise not cleanly shut down), so we could
  end up with many stale entries accumulating in the persistent domain
  configuration, which could later match some completely different device to
  what we had wanted attached to it. Which means until that somehow gets fixed,
  it's only safe to add them to a live guest domain, so that they will always be
  removed again when it is halted, no matter how it ended up getting halted.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Clearly we've still got some way to go to get to our ideal here.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="What_if_we_hit_it_with_*two*_hammers?"><a class="selflink" href="#What_if_we_hit_it_with_*two*_hammers?">What
  if we hit it with *two* hammers?</a></h2>
There appears to be only two ways that we can get notified of a guest machine
  being started at present. One involves running yet another daemon process,
  which would do little more than just sit around waiting for someone to start a
  guest so it could tell us about that. But then we'd have yet another thing to
  configure, yet another process running, and yet more problems with figuring
  out how to ensure we don't lose a race when the host is booted, between
  getting the initial set of device events, that process being ready and active,
  and any guests that will be autostarted at boot actually starting.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The other way is to use a libvirt hook. Which in turn has the problem of not
  actually allowing us to run any libvirt functions from it, which we need to do
  in order to attach the device to the host. And which we can't guarantee that
  we can just install by default, because there can be only one such hook on the
  system, which the local admin may already be using ...
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
There is a third way, but that would involve requiring the local admin to start
  all guest machines through a wrapper of our own, instead of via whatever
  mechanism they already know and use. Which doesn't scale to support other USB
  devices in the same situation, among the many ways that would be a horrible
  solution to inflict on people.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
But there is a loophole we can exploit. We can use the libvirt qemu hook to
  trigger a change event for <b>udev</b>, which can in turn invoke <b>bbvirt</b>
  in much the same way that would happen if the device was really hotplugged,
  which gives us the extra layer of indirection we need to be able to safely do
  that from the hook. Rube Goldberg would be proud, and some of the pieces may
  require hand-assembly, but with all of this in place, we can have something
  resembling normal USB functionality in the guest machines.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
It's not pretty, but it will work with what we have to work with.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>

To string this together, you'll need to ensure all of the following:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">-</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The <b>udev</b>(7) rules from the bit-babbler package are

      already be done. If you didn't, you will need to install the rules that
      are found in <i>debian/bit-babbler.udev</i> from the source package to a
      suitable place on your system (probably <i>/etc/udev/rules.d</i>).

      tweak the <b>udev</b> rules to suit.

      <i>/etc/bit-babbler/vm.conf</i>. If you wish to use a different file you
      will need to pass its location with the <b>--config</b> option in the
      <b>udev</b> rules, and update the hook script use that file too. The
      details of what you can put in that file are described in the
      <b>CONFIGURATION OPTIONS</b> section below.

<dl class="Bl-tag">

  <dd class="It-tag">The libvirt hook file is installed. If all the above is

      (which includes guests that are started automatically when the host
      machine boots).
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Until there is some safe way we can install this without conflicting with or
      overwriting an existing hook, everyone will need to do this step manually.
      If you have installed the Debian packages, then the example hook script
      that we've provided for this can be found in
      <i>/usr/share/doc/bit-babbler/examples/qemu-hook</i>. If you didn't it can
      be found in <i>libvirt/qemu-hook</i> of the source package.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    You will need to install that file as <i>/etc/libvirt/hooks/qemu</i>, or
      merge its content with the existing <i>qemu</i> file there if you already
      have that hook set. If that file did not previously exist, you will need
      to restart <b>libvirtd</b>(8) to get it to begin using it.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>

</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
That should cover all of the needed automation, but you can also attach and
  detach devices manually at any time too. The details of doing that will be
  described in the following section. Otherwise, with all the above done, there
  is no other reason to need to invoke <b>bbvirt</b> directly.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
There are two primary modes of operation for <b>bbvirt</b> which are selected by
  the initial action option. If the action to perform is <b>attach</b> or
  <b>detach</b> then only a single device will be acted upon, and which device
  that should be must be specified explicitly, even if there is only one device
  present on the host at the time. When invoking <b>bbvirt</b> manually, the
  <i>device</i> may be specified by its serial number, its logical address on
  the bus (in the form <i>busnum</i>:<i>devnum</i>, given as decimal integers),
  or its physical address on the bus (in the form
  <i>busnum</i>-<i>port</i>[<i>.port</i>&#x00A0;...]).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If the action to perform is <b>attach-all</b> or <b>detach-all</b>, then the
  device(s) to act upon are selected by <i>domain</i> association instead. If a
  <i>domain</i> is explicitly specified, then all devices which are assigned to
  that guest domain in the configuration file will be acted upon in the same way
  as if <b>bbvirt</b> was invoked for each of them individually with the
  <b>attach</b> or <b>detach</b> action. If no <i>domain</i> is provided, then
  all of the configured guest domains will be acted upon in this way.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The following additional options are available:

  <dd class="It-tag">Specify an alternative configuration file to import the

The <b>bbvirt</b> configuration file contains variable assignments using the
  <b>bash</b>(1) shell syntax. It is sourced as a shell snippet, so you could in
  principle construct the configuration for each domain dynamically, but most
  typically a simple static assignment of devices to domains will suffice. If
  you do elect to run code in it, you should be very defensive about namespacing
  any other variables you use, or any other side effects you might cause to
  happen. Any number of guest domains may be configured in it.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
For each guest domain, two variables control the behaviour of <b>bbvirt</b>:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>DOMAIN_URI_</b><i>domain</i><b>=</b><i>URI</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This variable is optional, and sets the <b>virsh</b>(1)
      connection <i>URI</i> to use when attaching or detaching devices from the
      given <i>domain</i>. If the <b>--connect</b> option is explicitly passed
      to <b>bbvirt</b> it will override what is set here. If the connection
      <i>URI</i> is not set using either of these methods then the <b>virsh</b>
      default for the user running <b>bbvirt</b> will be used (which would
      normally be root if run from <b>udev</b>).
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
  </dd>

  <dd class="It-tag">This variable is required if automatic passthrough of
      devices to a domain is desired. It is a bash array, populated with a space

      not currently plugged in. It is important to ensure that devices are only
      assigned to one <i>domain</i> though, and that devices assigned to guest
      domains will not be used by a <b>seedd</b>(1) instance running on the host
      (which means the <b>seedd</b> configuration needs to be passed an explicit
