<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
bidiv - bidirectional text filter</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
bidiv [ -plj ] [ -w width ] [file...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
bidiv is a filter, or viewer, for birectional text stored in
logical-order. It converts such text into visual-order text
which can be viewed on terminals that do not handle
bidi&acirc; <br>
rectionality. The output visual-order text is formatted
assuming a fixed number of characters per line
(automatically determined or given with the -w
parameter).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bidiv is oriented towards
Hebrew, and assumes the input to be a Hebrew and ASCII text
encoded in one of the two common logical-order encodings:
ISO-8859-8-i or UTF-8. Actually, <br>
bidiv guesses the encoding of its input at a character by
character basis, so the input might be a mix of ISO-8859-8-i
and Hebrew UTF-8. bidiv&rsquo;s output is visual-order text,
in <br>
either the ISO-8859-8 or UTF-8 encoding, depending on your
locale setting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bidiv reads each file in
sequence, converts it into visual order and writes it on the
standard output. Thus:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ bidiv file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">prints file on your terminal
(assuming it has the appropriate fonts, but no
bidirectionality support), and:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ bidiv file1 file2 | less</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">concatenates file1 and file2,
and shows the results using the pager less.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no input file is given, bidiv
reads from the standard input file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For more ideas on how to use
bidiv, see the EXAMPLES section below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-p Paragraph-based direction (default): When formatting a
bidirectional output line, bidiv needs to be aware of that
line&rsquo;s base direction. A line whose base direction is
RTL <br>
(right to left) gets right-justified and its first element
appears on the right. Otherwise, the line is left-justified
and its first element appears on the left.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -p option tells bidiv to
choose a base direction per paragraph, where a paragraph is
delimited by an empty line. This is bidiv&rsquo;s default
behavior, and usually gives <br>
the expected results on most texts and emails.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The direction of the entire
paragraph is chosen according to the first
strongly-directioned character (i.e., an alphabetic
character) appearing in the paragraph. Cur&acirc; <br>
rently, if the first output line of a paragraph has no
directional characters (e.g., a line of minus signs before
an email signature, or a line containing only numbers) <br>
that line is output with the same direction of the previous
paragraph, but it does not determine the direction of the
rest of the paragraph. If the first line of the first <br>
paragraph does not have a direction, the RTL direction is
arbitrarily chosen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l Line-based direction: This
option choose an alternative method of choosing each output
line&rsquo;s base direction. When this option is enabled,
the base direction of each out&acirc; <br>
put line is determined on its own (again, according to the
first character on the line with a strong direction). This
method may give wrong results in the case where a <br>
line starts with a word of the opposite direction. This case
is rare, but does happen under random line-splitting
circumstances, or when the text is defining words of a <br>
foreign language.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-j Do not justify: By default,
RTL lines are right-justified, i.e., they are padded with
spaces on the left when shorter than the required line width
(see the -w option). The <br>
-j option tells bidiv not to preform this justifications,
and leave short lines unpadded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w width <br>
bidiv formats its output for lines of the given width. Lines
are split when longer than this width, and RTL lines are
right-justfied to fill that width unless the -j <br>
option is given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the -w option is not given,
bidiv uses the value of the COLUMNS variable, which is
usually automatically defined by the user&rsquo;s shell.
When that both the -w option <br>
and the COLUMNS variable are missing, the default of 80
columns is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERANDS <br>
The following operand is supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file A path name of an input
file. If no file is specified, the standard input is
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
1. bidiv README | less</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. man something | bidiv |
less</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(or groff -man -Tlatin1
something.1 |sed &rsquo;s/.^H/1/g&rsquo; |../bidiv -w
65)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. set &quot;bidiv&quot; as a
filter for your mail program (mutt, pine, etc.) for viewing
mail with the ISO 8859-8-i character set, and Hebrew UTF-8
mail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
COLUMNS see -w option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The following exit values are returned:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 All input files were output
successfully.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>
