<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pamcrater creates a PAM image
which is a terrain map (not a visual image) of cratered
terrain. The terrain is as if a given number of impacts into
a surface create craters with <br>
random position and size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The size distribution of the
craters is based on a power law which results in many more
small craters than large ones. The number of craters of a
given size varies as the recip&acirc; <br>
rocal of the area as described on pages 31 and 32 of Peitgen
and Saupe[1]; cratered bodies in the Solar System are
observed to obey this relationship. The formula used to
obtain <br>
crater radii governed by this law from a uniformly
distributed pseudorandom sequence was developed by Rudy
Rucker.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A terrain map is a two
dimensional map of terrain elevations. the PAM image that
pamcrater produces is therefore not a visual image but a
depth-one image of tuple type &quot;eleva&acirc; <br>
tion&quot;, with the sample value being proportional to an
elevation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can visualize the terrain
map by generating a shaded relief image of it with
pamshadedrelief.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">High resolution images with
large numbers of craters often benefit from being piped
through pnmsmooth. The averaging performed by this process
eliminates some of the jagged pix&acirc; <br>
els and lends a mellow &lsquo;&lsquo;telescopic
image&rsquo;&rsquo; feel to the overall picture.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pamcrater generates only small
craters, which are hemispherical in shape (regardless of the
incidence angle of the impacting body, as long as the
velocity is sufficiently high). <br>
Large craters, such as Copernicus and Tycho on the Moon,
have a &lsquo;&lsquo;walled plain&rsquo;&rsquo; shape with a
cross-section more like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/&nbsp; / _____/
____________/____________/ _____</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Larger craters should really use
this profile, including the central peak, and totally
obliterate the pre-existing terrain.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The maxval of the PAM image is
always 65535.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The randomness in the image is
limited before Netpbm 10.37 (December 2006) -- if you run
the program twice in the same second, you may get identical
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
All options can be abbreviated to their shortest unique
prefix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-number n <br>
This causes pamcrater to generate n craters. If you do not
specify -number, it generates 50000 craters. Don&rsquo;t
expect to see them all! For every large crater there are
<br>
many, many more tiny ones which tend simply to erode the
landscape. In general, the more craters you specify, the
more realistic the result; ideally you want the entire <br>
terrain to have been extensively turned over again and again
by cratering. High resolution images containing five to ten
million craters are stunning but take longer to <br>
create.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-height height <br>
This sets the height of the generated image to height
pixels. The default height is 256 pixels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-width width <br>
This sets the width of the generated image to width pixels.
The default width is 256 pixels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-randomseed=integer <br>
This is the seed for the random number generator that
generates the pixels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use this to ensure you get the
same image on separate invocations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, pamcrater uses a
seed derived from the time of day and process ID, which
gives you fairly uncorrelated results in multiple
invocations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option was new in Netpbm
10.61 (December 2012).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-verbose <br>
This causes pamcrater to issue additional messages about
what it is doing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option was new in Neptbm
10.69 (December 2014).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESIGN NOTES <br>
Real craters have two distinct morphologies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY <br>
John Walker wrote pgmcrater in 1991 and it was included in
Pbmplus. pgmcrater did the equivalent of pamcrater |
pamshadedrelief. In Netpbm 10.68 (September 2014), Bryan
Hender&acirc; <br>
son split the functions of pgmcrater into two programs, one
(pamcrater) to compute elevations, and the other
(pamshadedrelief) to generate a shaded relief visual image
showing <br>
those elevations. Bryan did this because it is more in
keeping with Netpbm&rsquo;s modular architecture, and
because the pamshadedrelief might be useful with other
inputs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(Like all Netpbm programs,
pgmcrater was not static between the two events described
above; minor changes, including replacement of most of the
code, happened in between).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The original 1991 pgmcrater
manual contains the following:</p>
