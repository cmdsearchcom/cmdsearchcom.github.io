<p>LESSKEY(1) General Commands Manual LESSKEY(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
lesskey - specify key bindings for less</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
lesskey [-o output] [--] [input] <br>
lesskey [--output=output] [--] [input] <br>
lesskey -V <br>
lesskey --version</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Lesskey is used to specify a set of key bindings to be used
by less. The input file is a text file which describes the
key bindings. If the input file is &quot;-&quot;, standard
input is <br>
read. If no input file is specified, a standard filename is
used as the name of the input file, which depends on the
system being used: On Unix systems, $HOME/.lesskey is used;
<br>
on MS-DOS systems, $HOME/_lesskey is used; and on OS/2
systems $HOME/lesskey.ini is used, or $INIT/lesskey.ini if
$HOME is undefined. The output file is a binary file which
is <br>
used by less. If no output file is specified, and the
environment variable LESSKEY is set, the value of LESSKEY is
used as the name of the output file. Otherwise, a standard
<br>
filename is used as the name of the output file, which
depends on the system being used: On Unix and OS-9 systems,
$HOME/.less is used; on MS-DOS systems, $HOME/_less is used;
<br>
and on OS/2 systems, $HOME/less.ini is used, or
$INIT/less.ini if $HOME is undefined. If the output file
already exists, lesskey will overwrite it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -V or --version option
causes lesskey to print its version number and immediately
exit. If -V or --version is present, other options and
arguments are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The input file consists of one
or more sections. Each section starts with a line that
identifies the type of section. Possible sections are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#command <br>
Defines new command keys.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#line-edit <br>
Defines new line-editing keys.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#env Defines environment
variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Blank lines and lines which
start with a pound sign (#) are ignored, except for the
special section header lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMAND SECTION <br>
The command section begins with the line</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the command section is the
first section in the file, this line may be omitted. The
command section consists of lines of the form:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">string &lt;whitespace&gt; action
[extra-string] &lt;newline&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Whitespace is any sequence of
one or more spaces and/or tabs. The string is the command
key(s) which invoke the action. The string may be a single
command key, or a sequence of <br>
up to 15 keys. The action is the name of the less action,
from the list below. The characters in the string may appear
literally, or be prefixed by a caret to indicate a
con&acirc; <br>
trol key. A backslash followed by one to three octal digits
may be used to specify a character by its octal value. A
backslash followed by certain characters specifies input
<br>
characters as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BACKSPACE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">\ ESCAPE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NEWLINE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RETURN</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TAB</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UP ARROW</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DOWN ARROW</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RIGHT ARROW</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LEFT ARROW</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PAGE UP</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PAGE DOWN</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOME</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">END</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DELETE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A backslash followed by any
other character indicates that character is to be taken
literally. Characters which must be preceded by backslash
include caret, space, tab and the <br>
backslash itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An action may be followed by an
&quot;extra&quot; string. When such a command is entered
while running less, the action is performed, and then the
extra string is parsed, just as if it <br>
were typed in to less. This feature can be used in certain
cases to extend the functionality of a command. For example,
see the &quot;{&quot; and &quot;:t&quot; commands in the
example below. The <br>
extra string has a special meaning for the &quot;quit&quot;
action: when less quits, first character of the extra string
is used as its exit status.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLE <br>
The following input file describes the set of default
command keys used by less:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PRECEDENCE <br>
Commands specified by lesskey take precedence over the
default commands. A default command key may be disabled by
including it in the input file with the action
&quot;invalid&quot;. <br>
Alternatively, a key may be defined to do nothing by using
the action &quot;noaction&quot;. &quot;noaction&quot; is
similar to &quot;invalid&quot;, but less will give an error
beep for an &quot;invalid&quot; command, <br>
but not for a &quot;noaction&quot; command. In addition, ALL
default commands may be disabled by adding this control line
to the input file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#stop</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This will cause all default
commands to be ignored. The #stop line should be the last
line in that section of the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Be aware that #stop can be
dangerous. Since all default commands are disabled, you must
provide sufficient commands before the #stop line to enable
all necessary actions. For <br>
example, failure to provide a &quot;quit&quot; command can
lead to frustration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LINE EDITING SECTION <br>
The line-editing section begins with the line:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#line-edit</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This section specifies new key
bindings for the line editing commands, in a manner similar
to the way key bindings for ordinary commands are specified
in the #command section. <br>
The line-editing section consists of a list of keys and
actions, one per line as in the example below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLE <br>
The following input file describes the set of default
line-editing keys used by less:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#line-edit <br>
forw-complete <br>
17 back-complete <br>
\ back-complete <br>
^L expand <br>
^V literal <br>
^A literal <br>
\l right <br>

\h left <br>

\b word-left <br>

\w word-right <br>

\i insert <br>
\x delete <br>

\X word-delete <br>
\kx word-delete <br>
\ word-backspace <br>
\0 home <br>
home <br>
\$ end <br>
end <br>
\k up <br>
up <br>
\j down <br>
^G abort</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LESS ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
The environment variable section begins with the line</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#env</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Following this line is a list of
environment variable assignments. Each line consists of an
environment variable name, an equals sign (=) and the value
to be assigned to the <br>
environment variable. White space before and after the
equals sign is ignored. Variables assigned in this way are
visible only to less. If a variable is specified in the
sys&acirc; <br>
tem environment and also in a lesskey file, the value in the
lesskey file takes precedence. Although the lesskey file can
be used to override variables set in the environment, <br>
the main purpose of assigning variables in the lesskey file
is simply to have all less configuration information stored
in one file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLE <br>
The following input file sets the -i option whenever less is
run, and specifies the character set to be
&quot;latin1&quot;:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#env <br>
LESS = -i <br>
LESSCHARSET = latin1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
less(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WARNINGS <br>
On MS-DOS and OS/2 systems, certain keys send a sequence of
characters which start with a NUL character (0). This NUL
character should be represented as 340 in a lesskey
file.</p>
