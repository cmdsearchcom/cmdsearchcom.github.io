<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ppmtoterm - convert a PPM image to a ANSI ISO 6429 ascii
image</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ppmtoterm</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[ppmfile]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All options can be abbreviated
to their shortest unique prefix. You may use two hyphens
instead of one. You may separate an option name and its
value with white space instead <br>
of an equals sign.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This program is part of Netpbm(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This program tries to produce an
accurate representation of a PPM image on an terminal that
implements the ANSI ISO 6429 standard. It approximates
colors, finding the minimum <br>
Cartesian distance between the input RGB vectors and the
ones in the generated palette. As the available color
palette is somewhat restricted, you get the best results
when the <br>
colors in the original image are few and the RGB intensities
are close to zero, half of maximum, and maximum.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can usually get good results
with cartoons or images with plain colors (no gradients).
With photos, results can vary, but are usually not very
accurate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The output image has one line
for each row and one character for each column of the input
image. E.g. an 80 pixel by 25 pixel PPM image would fill up
an 80x25 terminal screen. <br>
Use pamscale or pamcut to make your image fit properly on
your screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Furthermore, use pamscale to
recover the proper aspect ratio, because a character on a
terminal screen is rarely square. Typically, a character is
twice has high as it is wide, <br>
so in order for a 20x20 image to appear square on your
terminal, as it should, you&rsquo;ll want to squash it
vertically or stretch it horizontally by a factor of two
(resulting int <br>
10x20 characters are 20x40 characters).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The image starts at the current
cursor position on the terminal screen. Each successive row
starts at Column 0 on the screen. If you want to shift the
image up or down, for <br>
example to center it, use pnmpad on the input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This program was born with the
objective of displaying nice color images on the Linux
console, e.g. a proper logo at Linux boot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pbmto4425 does a similar thing
for black and white images, using line drawing characters,
on some terminals.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
