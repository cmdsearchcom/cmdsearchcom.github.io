AcidRip is a Gtk2::Perl application for ripping and encoding DVD's and other
  media files. It neatly wraps MPlayer and MEncoder, which is pretty handy,
  seeing as MPlayer is by far the best video player software. As well as
  creating a simple interface for those scared of getting down and dirty with
  MEncoders command line interface, It also automates the process in a number of
  ways:

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="USAGE"><a class="selflink" href="#USAGE">USAGE</a></h1>
Some simple steps to ripping with AcidRip:
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="1_-_Load_DVD_or_file"><a class="selflink" href="#1_-_Load_DVD_or_file">1
  - Load DVD or file</a></h2>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">To load a DVD, press &quot;Load&quot; with the
  disk in your drive (after checking that the device is correct. You might want
  to symlink it to /dev/dvd). To load a file, or a whole directory, enter the
  location in the &quot;Path&quot; box and hit Load. This loads contents and
  displays it as a tree of tracks (and chapters for DVD). The longest track,
  assumed to be the main feature, is automatically selected for you. If you wish
  to only encode certain chapters of a DVD title, just expand that branch and
  click on the first and last chapters you want, while holding shift.</div>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="2_-_Choose_correct_file_name_and_desired_size"><a class="selflink" href="#2_-_Choose_correct_file_name_and_desired_size">2
  - Choose correct file name and desired size</a></h2>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">The name of the output file is defined by a
  number of variables:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">%T - Title of the track, as in the editable box above</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">%N - Number of the selected track - useful for batch
      encoding</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">%L - Length of the selected track</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">%f - The first letter of the title [useful for
      organisation]</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">%b - bitrate of the video stream</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">%l - language of the audio track</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">%w - width of the video output</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">%h - height of the video output</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
For example, &quot;/var/film/%f/%T-%N-%wx%h&quot; might be evaluated to
  &quot;/var/film/s/simpsons-2-480x360&quot;.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Also select a file size. This is used to calculate bitrates for the codecs you
  are going to use. If the codecs you choose do NOT support a bitrate option
  (e.g copy, rawrgb etc. for video) then the given size can NOT be enforced at
  all.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
A film can be split into a number of files by setting a value in the relevant
  box. The created files are split by chapter boundaries, so the chapters must
  be suitable.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
You can also add additional information, akin to the ID3 tag's in MP3s. Choose
  the field in the combo box and enter the correct value. Few players other than
  mplayer use this information though.</div>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="3_-_Choose_audio_track"><a class="selflink" href="#3_-_Choose_audio_track">3
  - Choose audio track</a></h2>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Select the language for the audio. You may
  also have the option to encode directors commentary etc., however the tracks
  will only be listed as such if the description is actually on the DVD itself,
  which doesn't seem to happen that often.</div>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="4_-_Choose_audio_output"><a class="selflink" href="#4_-_Choose_audio_output">4
  - Choose audio output</a></h2>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Use the combo box to choose how to encode the
  audio. normally this should be an MP3 stream. If you do not have mp3lame
  listed in the codecs combo box then you need to compile it into mencoder, it
  is nothing to do with acidrip at all. If you choose mp3lame set your options
  in the box below. See the mencoder manpage for a list of options (look for
  &quot;lameopts&quot;).</div>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="5_-_Choose_video_output"><a class="selflink" href="#5_-_Choose_video_output">5
  - Choose video output</a></h2>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Select the desired video output. lavc
  (FFMpeg's avcodec libraries) is the default choice. Despite what you might
  assume &quot;vcodec=mpeg4&quot; relates to divx4/5 encoding, trust me on this
  one..! Many people prefer Xvid encoding, it's up to you of course. Set any
  options specific to the selected output in the options box below. See the
  relevant entries in the mencoder manpage for the full selection. Only defaults
  for lavc are provided. The three main codecs can also use 2 pass encoding,
  select the option if you wish to encode the film twice to improve quality.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
You should also check the bitrate here. This value is based on the desired file
  size and the selected audio bitrates. You may wish to enter your own bitrate
  and lock the value using the check box to ensure that it is not changed. This
  naturally means that the file size can not be guarenteed.</div>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="6_-_Crop_film"><a class="selflink" href="#6_-_Crop_film">6
  - Crop film</a></h2>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Assuming you are using a proper encoding codec
  (lavc / xvid / divx) then you should want to chop off any widescreen bars and
  such like. These bars just soak up disk space, leaving less for the actual
  film. Just pressing the &quot;Detect&quot; button should suffice, but it's a
  good idea to check the results to make sure, and adjust the values
  accordingly. Pressing the &quot;Detect&quot; button uses mplayer to pick
  frames throughout the DVD and analyzes it for unwanted areas. Note that the
  values for cropping are not related at all to the output size, but instead the
  size of the DVD itself (720x568 for PAL, 720x480 for NTSC).</div>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="7_-_Scale_film"><a class="selflink" href="#7_-_Scale_film">7
  - Scale film</a></h2>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">The final output dimensions of the film can
  now be set. By default the height is locked against the width setting in line
  with the aspect of the video (including any cropping to be applied). The
  scaling of the film is most likely to affect the BPP (Bits Per Pixel) values
  of the file. For a typical divx film you want about 0.17 - 0.20. A value
  higher than this just wastes space: divx just doesn't *need* it..., a lower
  value and the output is blocky and poor. By adjusting the width of the film
  you can affect the BPP value directly. Obviously file size and crop values can
  also affect the BPP among others.</div>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="8_-_Filters"><a class="selflink" href="#8_-_Filters">8
  - Filters</a></h2>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">You can now enter any flags for processing the
  film, such as deinterlacing, deblocking etc. See the mencoder manpage for
  details. There are no set options other than a default &quot;pp=de&quot; as
  you should only use the options if you know what they are there for.
  rtfm!</div>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="9_-_Encode"><a class="selflink" href="#9_-_Encode">9
  - Encode</a></h2>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Everything should be set up now so press the
  &quot;Start&quot; button and make some tea.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
That is all that should be required to rip a DVD or file(s). However you should
  not need to perform each step every time. By saving your settings they will be
  automatically loaded next time, and if &quot;Autoload media&quot; is selected
  in the &quot;Additional settings&quot; dialog then the DVD / file / directory
  will be automatically loaded for you. Further more is autoload is set, and
  cropping in enabled then it will be cropped automatically too. After this, all
  you should ever need to do is that press start. One button!
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="QUEUE"><a class="selflink" href="#QUEUE">QUEUE</a></h1>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Acidrip has the ability to build and process a
  queue of events. Clicking on &quot;Queue&quot; rather that &quot;Start&quot;
  will take the current encoding settings and create the commands as normal but
  then add them to an execution queue which will not be executed until the
  &quot;Start&quot; button is pressed. The queue can also be exported to a
  standard bash script (~/acidrip.sh) to execute outside of acidrip.</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ADDITIONAL_FEATURES"><a class="selflink" href="#ADDITIONAL_FEATURES">ADDITIONAL
  FEATURES</a></h1>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">There are a number of other additional
  features in the &quot;Additional settings&quot; dialog window. These are:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Mencoder / Mplayer / lsdvd entries: Change the default program names /
  locations. Allows you to set default parameters not handled elsewhere, or set
  something such as changing &quot;mencoder&quot; to &quot;nice mencoder&quot;
  to run the program via nice.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Cache DVD / Delete Cache: Values used in caching a disc. Firstly the directory
  to place the cached track in, wether to cache at all and wether to
  automatically delete the cache after encoding. NB. you do NOT NOT NOT *need*
  to cache a DVD at all, you jsut might want to.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Language: The default ISO639 language code or full language name to use, e.g.
  en, de, English...
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Overwrite files: Movie files will be overwritten if they aleady exist.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Shutdown: Attempt to shutdown system after completion.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Compact progress dialog: Hides the main window while encoding, and only shows
  the encoding box by itself. There is no &quot;Stop&quot; button etc, so as
  well as the smaller footprint you can't stop it by mistake.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Enforce size check: The file size value set will turn red if there is apparently
  not enough space in the provided output directory. As the file size value is
  only used as an estimate and does not guarentee a fixed output size, you may
  well know something acidrip doesn't, so you can allow the program to encode
  regardless if you wish.</div>
