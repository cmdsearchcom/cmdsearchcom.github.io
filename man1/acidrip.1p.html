<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
acidrip - a Gtk2::Perl wrapper for MPlayer / Mencoder</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
acidrip</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
AcidRip is a Gtk2::Perl application for ripping and encoding
DVD&rsquo;s and other media files. It neatly wraps MPlayer
and MEncoder, which is pretty handy, seeing as MPlayer is by
far <br>
the best video player software. As well as creating a simple
interface for those scared of getting down and dirty with
MEncoders command line interface, It also automates the <br>
process in a number of ways:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Parses DVD into
contents tree</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Finds longest
title</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Calculate video
bitrate for given filesize</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Finds black
bands and crops them</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Divides long
films into multiple files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Other stuff!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USAGE <br>
Some simple steps to ripping with AcidRip:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 - Load DVD or file <br>
To load a DVD, press &quot;Load&quot; with the disk in your
drive (after checking that the device is correct. You might
want to symlink it to /dev/dvd). To load a file, or a whole
<br>
directory, enter the location in the &quot;Path&quot; box
and hit Load. This loads contents and displays it as a tree
of tracks (and chapters for DVD). The longest track, assumed
to <br>
be the main feature, is automatically selected for you. If
you wish to only encode certain chapters of a DVD title,
just expand that branch and click on the first and last <br>
chapters you want, while holding shift.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 - Choose correct file name and
desired size <br>
The name of the output file is defined by a number of
variables:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; %T - Title of
the track, as in the editable box above</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; %N - Number of
the selected track - useful for batch encoding</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; %L - Length of
the selected track</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; %f - The first
letter of the title [useful for organisation]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; %b - bitrate of
the video stream</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; %l - language of
the audio track</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; %w - width of
the video output</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; %h - height of
the video output</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example,
&quot;/var/film/%f/%T-%N-%wx%h&quot; might be evaluated to
&quot;/var/film/s/simpsons-2-480x360&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also select a file size. This is
used to calculate bitrates for the codecs you are going to
use. If the codecs you choose do NOT support a bitrate
option (e.g copy, rawrgb <br>
etc. for video) then the given size can NOT be enforced at
all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A film can be split into a
number of files by setting a value in the relevant box. The
created files are split by chapter boundaries, so the
chapters must be suitable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also add additional
information, akin to the ID3 tag&rsquo;s in MP3s. Choose the
field in the combo box and enter the correct value. Few
players other than mplayer use <br>
this information though.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3 - Choose audio track <br>
Select the language for the audio. You may also have the
option to encode directors commentary etc., however the
tracks will only be listed as such if the description is
<br>
actually on the DVD itself, which doesn&rsquo;t seem to
happen that often.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4 - Choose audio output <br>
Use the combo box to choose how to encode the audio.
normally this should be an MP3 stream. If you do not have
mp3lame listed in the codecs combo box then you need to
compile <br>
it into mencoder, it is nothing to do with acidrip at all.
If you choose mp3lame set your options in the box below. See
the mencoder manpage for a list of options (look for <br>
&quot;lameopts&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5 - Choose video output <br>
Select the desired video output. lavc (FFMpeg&rsquo;s
avcodec libraries) is the default choice. Despite what you
might assume &quot;vcodec=mpeg4&quot; relates to divx4/5
encoding, trust me <br>
on this one..! Many people prefer Xvid encoding, it&rsquo;s
up to you of course. Set any options specific to the
selected output in the options box below. See the relevant
entries <br>
in the mencoder manpage for the full selection. Only
defaults for lavc are provided. The three main codecs can
also use 2 pass encoding, select the option if you wish to
<br>
encode the film twice to improve quality.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You should also check the
bitrate here. This value is based on the desired file size
and the selected audio bitrates. You may wish to enter your
own bitrate and lock the <br>
value using the check box to ensure that it is not changed.
This naturally means that the file size can not be
guarenteed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6 - Crop film <br>
Assuming you are using a proper encoding codec (lavc / xvid
/ divx) then you should want to chop off any widescreen bars
and such like. These bars just soak up disk space, <br>
leaving less for the actual film. Just pressing the
&quot;Detect&quot; button should suffice, but it&rsquo;s a
good idea to check the results to make sure, and adjust the
values accordingly. <br>
Pressing the &quot;Detect&quot; button uses mplayer to pick
frames throughout the DVD and analyzes it for unwanted
areas. Note that the values for cropping are not related at
all to <br>
the output size, but instead the size of the DVD itself
(720x568 for PAL, 720x480 for NTSC).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">7 - Scale film <br>
The final output dimensions of the film can now be set. By
default the height is locked against the width setting in
line with the aspect of the video (including any cropping
<br>
to be applied). The scaling of the film is most likely to
affect the BPP (Bits Per Pixel) values of the file. For a
typical divx film you want about 0.17 - 0.20. A value <br>
higher than this just wastes space: divx just doesn&rsquo;t
*need* it..., a lower value and the output is blocky and
poor. By adjusting the width of the film you can affect the
BPP <br>
value directly. Obviously file size and crop values can also
affect the BPP among others.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">8 - Filters <br>
You can now enter any flags for processing the film, such as
deinterlacing, deblocking etc. See the mencoder manpage for
details. There are no set options other than a <br>
default &quot;pp=de&quot; as you should only use the options
if you know what they are there for. rtfm!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">9 - Encode <br>
Everything should be set up now so press the
&quot;Start&quot; button and make some tea.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">That is all that should be
required to rip a DVD or file(s). However you should not
need to perform each step every time. By saving your
settings they will be automatically <br>
loaded next time, and if &quot;Autoload media&quot; is
selected in the &quot;Additional settings&quot; dialog then
the DVD / file / directory will be automatically loaded for
you. Further more is <br>
autoload is set, and cropping in enabled then it will be
cropped automatically too. After this, all you should ever
need to do is that press start. One button!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">QUEUE <br>
Acidrip has the ability to build and process a queue of
events. Clicking on &quot;Queue&quot; rather that
&quot;Start&quot; will take the current encoding settings
and create the commands as <br>
normal but then add them to an execution queue which will
not be executed until the &quot;Start&quot; button is
pressed. The queue can also be exported to a standard bash
script <br>
(~/acidrip.sh) to execute outside of acidrip.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ADDITIONAL FEATURES <br>
There are a number of other additional features in the
&quot;Additional settings&quot; dialog window. These
are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mencoder / Mplayer / lsdvd
entries: Change the default program names / locations.
Allows you to set default parameters not handled elsewhere,
or set something such as <br>
changing &quot;mencoder&quot; to &quot;nice mencoder&quot;
to run the program via nice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cache DVD / Delete Cache: Values
used in caching a disc. Firstly the directory to place the
cached track in, wether to cache at all and wether to
automatically delete the <br>
cache after encoding. NB. you do NOT NOT NOT *need* to cache
a DVD at all, you jsut might want to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Language: The default ISO639
language code or full language name to use, e.g. en, de,
English...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Overwrite files: Movie files
will be overwritten if they aleady exist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Shutdown: Attempt to shutdown
system after completion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Compact progress dialog: Hides
the main window while encoding, and only shows the encoding
box by itself. There is no &quot;Stop&quot; button etc, so
as well as the smaller footprint <br>
you can&rsquo;t stop it by mistake.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enforce size check: The file
size value set will turn red if there is apparently not
enough space in the provided output directory. As the file
size value is only used as an <br>
estimate and does not guarentee a fixed output size, you may
well know something acidrip doesn&rsquo;t, so you can allow
the program to encode regardless if you wish.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Please report any bugs or functional inconsistencies by
email or on the sourceforge.net tracker.</p>
