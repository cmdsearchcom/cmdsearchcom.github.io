<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
gpsfake - test harness for gpsd, simulating a GPS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
gpsfake [-1] [-h] [-b] [-c interval] [-i] [-D debuglevel]
[-l] [-m monitor] [-g] [-n] [-o options] [-p] [-P port] [-r
initcmd] [-s speed] [-S] [-u] [-t] [-v] [logfile...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
gpsfake is a test harness for gpsd and its clients. It opens
a pty (pseudo-TTY), launches a gpsd instance that thinks the
slave side of the pty is its GPS device, and repeatedly <br>
feeds the contents of one or more test logfiles through the
master side to the GPS. If there are multiple logfiles,
sentences from them are interleaved in the order the files
are <br>
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gpsfake does not require root
privileges, and can be run concurrently with a production
gpsd instance without causing problems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The logfiles may contain packets
in any supported format, including in particular NMEA, SiRF,
TSIP, or Zodiac. Leading lines beginning with # will be
treated as comments and <br>
ignored, except in the following special cases:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; a comment of the
form #Date: yyyy-mm-dd (ISO8601 date format) may be used to
set the initial date for the log.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; a comment of the
form #Serial: [0-9]* [78][NOE][12] may be used to set serial
parameters for the log - baud rate, word length, stop
bits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; a comment of the
form #Transport: UDP may be used to fake a UDP source rather
than the normal pty.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The gpsd instance is run in
foreground. The thread sending fake GPS data to the daemon
is run in background.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
With the -1 option, the logfile is interpreted once only
rather than repeatedly. This option is intended to
facilitate regression testing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -b enables a twirling-baton
progress indicator on standard error. At termination, it
reports elapsed time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -c sets the delay between
sentences in seconds. Fractional values of seconds are
legal. The default is zero (no delay).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -l makes the program dump a
line or packet number just before each sentence is fed to
the daemon. If the sentence is textual (e.g. NMEA), the text
is dumped as well. If not, <br>
the packet will be dumped in hexadecimal (except for RTCM
packets, which aren&rsquo;t dumped at all). This option is
useful for checking that gpsfake is getting packet
boundaries <br>
right.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -i is for single-stepping
through logfiles. It dumps the line or packet number (and
the sentence if the protocol is textual) followed by &quot;?
&quot;. Only when the user keys Enter <br>
is the line actually fed to gpsd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -m specifies a monitor
program inside which the daemon should be run. This option
is intended to be used with valgrind(1), gdb(1) and similar
programs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -g uses the monitor facility
to run the gpsd instance within gpsfake under control of
gdb.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -o specifies options to pass
to the daemon. The -n option passes -n to start the daemon
reading the GPS without waiting for a client (equivalent to
-o &quot;-n&quot;). The -D passes a <br>
-D option to the daemon: thus -D 4 is shorthand for -o
&quot;-D 4&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -p (&quot;pipe&quot;) option
sets watcher mode and dumps the NMEA and GPSD notifications
generated by the log to standard output. This is useful for
regression-testing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -P (&quot;port&quot;) option
sets the daemon&rsquo;s listening port.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -r specifies an
initialization command to use in pipe mode. The default is
?WATCH={&quot;enable&quot;:true,&quot;json&quot;:true}.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -s sets the baud rate for
the slave tty. The default is 4800.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The option -S tells gpsfake to
insert realistic delays in the test input rather than trying
to stuff it through the daemon as fast as possible. This
will make the test(s) run <br>
much slower, but avoids flaky failures due to machine lode
and possible race conditions in the pty layer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -t forces the test framework
to use TCP rather than pty devices. Besides being a test of
TCP source handling, this may be useful for testing from
within chroot jails where <br>
access to pty devices is locked out.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -u forces the test framework
to use UDP rather than pty devices. Besides being a test of
UDP source handling, this may be useful for testing from
within chroot jails where <br>
access to pty devices is locked out.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -v enables verbose progress
reports to stderr. It is mainly useful for debugging gpsfake
itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -x dumps packets as gpsfake
gathers them. It is mainly useful for debugging gpsfake
itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -h makes gpsfake print a
usage message and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The argument must be the name of
a file containing the data to be cycled at the device.
gpsfake will print a notification each time it cycles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normally, gpsfake creates a pty
for each logfile and passes the slave side of the device to
the daemon. If the header comment in the logfile contains
the string &quot;UDP&quot;, packets <br>
are instead shipped via UDP port 5000 to the address
192.168.0.1.255. You can monitor them with this: tcpdump -s0
-n -A -i lo udp and port 5000.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MAGIC COMMENTS <br>
Certain magic comments in test load headers can change the
conditions of the test. These are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Serial: <br>
May contain a serial-port setting such as 4800 7N2 - baud
rate followed by 7 or 8 for byte length, N or O or E for
parity and 1 or 2 for stop bits. The test is run with those
<br>
settings on the slave port that the daemon sees.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Transport: <br>
Values &rsquo;TCP&rsquo; and &rsquo;UDP&rsquo; force the use
of TCP and UDP feeds respectively (the default is a
pty).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Delay-Cookie: <br>
Must be followed by two whitespace-separated fields, a
delimiter character and a numeric delay in seconds. Instead
of being broken up by packet boundaries, the test load is
<br>
split on the delimiters. The delay is performed after each
feed. Can be useful for imposing write boundaries in the
middle of packets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CUSTOM TESTS <br>
gpsfake is a trivial wrapper around a Python module, also
named gpsfake, that can be used to fully script sessions
involving a gpsd instance, any number of client sessions,
and <br>
any number of fake GPSes feeding the daemon instance with
data from specified sentence logs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Source and embedded
documentation for this module is shipped with the gpsd
development tools. You can use it to torture-test either
gpsd itself or any gpsd-aware client <br>
application.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Logfiles for the use with
gpsfake can be retrieved using gpspipe, gpscat, or gpsmon
from the gpsd distribution, or any other application which
is able to create a compatible <br>
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If gpsfake exits with
&quot;Cannot execute gpsd: executable not found.&quot; the
environment variable GPSD_HOME can be set to the path where
gpsd can be found. (instead of adding that <br>
folder to the PATH environment variable</p>
