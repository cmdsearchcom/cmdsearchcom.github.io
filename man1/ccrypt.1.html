<p>CCRYPT(1) Encryption CCRYPT(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ccrypt - encrypt and decrypt files and streams</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ccrypt [mode] [options] [file...] <br>
ccencrypt [options] [file...] <br>
ccdecrypt [options] [file...] <br>
ccat [options] file...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
ccrypt is a utility for encrypting and decrypting files and
streams. It was designed to replace the standard unix crypt
utility, which is notorious for using a very weak
encryp&acirc; <br>
tion algorithm. ccrypt is based on the Rijndael block
cipher, a version of which was also chosen by the U.S.
government as the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES, see
<br>
http://www.nist.gov/aes). This cipher is believed to provide
very strong cryptographic security.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unlike unix crypt, the algorithm
provided by ccrypt is not symmetric, i.e., one must specify
whether to encrypt or decrypt. The most common way to invoke
ccrypt is via the com&acirc; <br>
mands ccencrypt and ccdecrypt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Encryption and decryption
depends on a keyword (or key phrase) supplied by the user.
By default, the user is prompted to enter a keyword from the
terminal. Keywords can consist <br>
of any number of characters, and all characters are
significant (although ccrypt internally hashes the key to
256 bits). Longer keywords provide better security than
short ones, <br>
since they are less likely to be discovered by exhaustive
search.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MODES <br>
ccrypt can operate in five different modes. If more than one
mode is specified, the last one specified takes precedence.
The aliases ccencrypt, ccdecrypt, and ccat are provided <br>
as a convenience; they are equivalent to ccrypt -e, ccrypt
-d, and ccrypt -c, respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e, --encrypt Encrypt. This is
the default mode. If filename arguments are given, encrypt
the files and append the suffix .cpt to their names.
Otherwise, run as a filter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --decrypt Decrypt. If
filename arguments are given, decrypt the files and strip
the suffix .cpt from the filenames, if present. Otherwise,
run as a filter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --cat Decrypt one or more
files to standard output. If no filename arguments are
given, decrypt as a filter. Implies -l.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x, --keychange <br>
Change the key of encrypted data. In this mode, ccrypt
prompts for two passwords: the old one and the new one. If
filename arguments are given, modify the files. <br>
Otherwise, run as a filter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u, --unixcrypt <br>
Simulate the old unix crypt command. Note: the cipher used
by unix crypt has been broken and is not secure. Please use
this option only to decrypt existing files. <br>
If filename arguments are given, decrypt the files to
stdout. Otherwise, run as a filter. Note that for the unix
crypt format, there is no easy way to detect <br>
whether a given key matches or not; thus, for safety, this
mode does not overwrite files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The following options are supported in addition to the modes
described above:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b, --brave When reading an
encryption key from the terminal, ask the user only once for
the key. By default, ccrypt will ask the user to enter such
keys twice, as a safeguard <br>
against accidentally destroying data due to a mistyped key.
Using the --brave option disables this safety check. Never
use it, unless you know what you are doing. <br>
See also --timid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E var, --envvar var <br>
Read the keyword from the environment variable var. Note
that this might be unsafe on certain systems, namely where
users can use the ps command to see the envi&acirc; <br>
ronment of a process owner by another user. On most modern
systems, however, such behavior of ps is disabled and the -E
option should be safe there. Also, as an <br>
added security measure, ccrypt erases the keyword from its
environment immediately after reading it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, --force Overwrite existing
files or operate on write-protected files without asking any
questions. Also, override ccrypt&rsquo;s reluctance to write
or read encrypted data to or <br>
from a terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F var, --envvar2 var <br>
Same as -E, except for second keyword (in keychange
mode).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help Help. Print usage
information and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H key, --key2 key <br>
Same as -K, except for second keyword (in keychange
mode).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k file, --keyfile file <br>
Read the keyword as the first line from the named file. In
keychange mode, two keywords are read as the first two lines
of the file. The filename &quot;-&quot; may be given <br>
for reading keywords from standard input. Using the -k -
option and sending the keyword on stdin is probably the
safest way to pass a keyword to ccrypt from <br>
another program or script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-K key, --key key <br>
Specify the keyword on the command line. This is unsafe,
because any other user can see the command line by running
the ps command. Only use this option for test&acirc; <br>
ing purposes, and never with a real keyword.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-y file, --keyref file <br>
In encryption or keychange mode, check the encryption key
against the named file, which must have been previously
encrypted with the same key. Exit with an error <br>
message if the key does not match. This option is useful as
an alternative to --timid, to guard against mistyped keys in
situations where several files are <br>
encrypted with the same key. This option implies --brave,
unless the --timid option is explicitly given after the
--keyref option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, --symlinks Force
encryption/decryption of symbolic links. By default,
symbolic links are ignored except in cat or unixcrypt mode.
Note that with the -l option, encryp&acirc; <br>
tion/decryption of a symbolic link causes the suffix .cpt to
be added/removed from the name of the link, not the name of
the file pointed to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L, --license Print license info
and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m, --mismatch Normally, ccrypt
refuses to decrypt data with a key that does not seem to
match. The -m option overrides this restriction. This can
sometimes be useful in recover&acirc; <br>
ing data from a corrupted file (see RECOVERING DATA FROM
CORRUPTED FILES). To avoid irretrievable loss of data when
decrypting with a wrong key, this option cannot <br>
be used with modes that overwrite the input file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P prompt, --prompt prompt <br>
Use prompt instead of the default prompt &quot;Enter
encryption/decryption key: &quot;. This may be useful in
some shell scripts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q, --quiet Suppress most
warnings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Q prompt, --prompt2 prompt <br>
Same as -P, except for second keyword (in keychange
mode).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, --recursive <br>
Traverse subdirectories recursively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R, --rec-symlinks <br>
Traverse subdirectories recursively, and also follow
symbolic links to subdirectories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --strictsuffix <br>
Refuse to encrypt files that already have the .cpt suffix
(or that selected with -S). This can be useful when adding
some files to a directory of already encrypted <br>
files. This option has no effect in decryption or keychange
mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S .suf, --suffix .suf <br>
Use the suffix .suf instead of the default suffix .cpt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t, --timid When reading an
encryption key from the terminal, ask the user to enter the
key twice. If the two entered keys are not identical, abort.
This is a safeguard <br>
against accidentally destroying data by encrypting it with a
mistyped key. Note: this behavior is now the default, and
can be overridden with the --brave option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T, --tmpfiles This option
causes ccrypt to use temporary files during
encryption/decryption, rather than overwriting the file
contents destructively. This method leaves the <br>
original file contents lying around in unused sectors of the
file system, and thus is less secure than the default
behavior. However, in situations where this loss <br>
of security is not important, the --tmpfiles option can
provide a measure of protection against data being corrupted
due to a system crash in the middle of over&acirc; <br>
writing a file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose Print progress
information to stderr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version Print version info
and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-- End of options. Any remaining
arguments are interpreted as filenames. This also turns off
filter mode, even if zero filenames follow. This might be
useful in the <br>
context of shell pattern expansion; ccrypt -- * will behave
correctly even if no files match the pattern *.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES ON USAGE <br>
The user interface of ccrypt intentionally resembles that of
GNU gzip, although it is not identical. When invoked with
filename arguments, ccrypt normally modifies the files in
<br>
place, overwriting their old content. Unlike gzip, the
output is not first written to a temporary file; instead,
the data is literally overwritten. For encryption, this is
usu&acirc; <br>
ally the desired behavior, since one does not want copies of
the unencrypted data to remain in hidden places in the file
system. The disadvantage is that if ccrypt is interrupted
<br>
in the middle of writing to a file, the file will end up in
a corrupted, partially encrypted state. However, in such
cases it is possible to recover most of the data; see
RECOV&acirc; <br>
ERING DATA FROM CORRUPTED FILES below. If you want to force
ccrypt to use temporary files, use the --tmpfiles
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When ccrypt receives an
interrupt signal (Ctrl-C) while updating a file in place, it
does not exit immediately, but rather delays the exit until
after it finishes writing to the <br>
current file. This is to prevent files from being partially
overwritten and thus corrupted. If you want to force ccrypt
to exit immediately, just press Ctrl-C twice quickly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The encryption algorithm used by
ccrypt uses a random seed that is different each time. As a
result, encrypting the same file twice will never yield the
same result. The advan&acirc; <br>
tage of this method is that similarities in plaintext do not
lead to similarities in ciphertext; there is no way of
telling whether the content of two encrypted files is
similar <br>
or not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Because of the use of a random
seed, decrypting and re-encrypting a file with the same key
will not lead to an identical file. It is primarily for this
reason that ccrypt refuses <br>
to decrypt files with a non-matching key; if this were
allowed, there would be no way afterwards to restore the
original file, and the data would be irretrievably lost.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When overwriting files, special
care is taken with hard links and symbolic links. Each
physical file (i.e., each inode) is processed at most once,
no matter how many paths to it <br>
are encountered on the command line or in subdirectories
traversed recursively. For each file that has multiple hard
links, a warning is printed, to alert the user that not all
<br>
paths to the file might have been properly renamed. Symbolic
links are ignored except in cat mode, or unless the -l or -R
option is given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unlike gzip, ccrypt does not
complain about files that have improper suffixes. It is
legal to doubly encrypt a file. It is also legal to decrypt
a file that does not have the <br>
.cpt suffix, provided the file contains valid data for the
given decryption key. Use the --strictsuffix option if you
want to prevent ccrypt from encrypting files that already
<br>
have a .cpt suffix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Regarding encryption and
compression: encrypted data is statistically
indistinguishable from random data, and thus it cannot be
compressed. But of course it is possible to com&acirc; <br>
press the data first, then encrypt it. Suggested file
suffixes are .gz.cpt or .gzc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RECOVERING DATA FROM CORRUPTED
FILES <br>
Encrypted data might be corrupted for a number of reasons.
For instance, a file might have been partially encrypted or
decrypted if ccrypt was interrupted while processing the
<br>
file. Or data might be corrupted by a software or hardware
error, or during transmission over a network. The encryption
algorithm used by ccrypt is designed to allow recovery <br>
from errors. In general, only a few bytes of data will be
lost near where the error occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Data encrypted by ccrypt can be
thought of as a sequence of 32-byte blocks. To decrypt a
particular block, ccrypt only needs to know the decryption
key, the data of the block <br>
itself, and the data of the block immediately preceding it.
ccrypt cannot tell whether a block is corrupted or not,
except the very first block, which is special. Thus, if the
<br>
encrypted data has been altered in the middle or near the
end of a file, ccrypt can be run to decrypt it as usual, and
most of the data will be decrypted correctly, except near
<br>
where the corruption occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The very first block of
encrypted data is special, because it does not actually
correspond to any plaintext data; this block holds the
random seed generated at encryption time. <br>
ccrypt also uses the very first block to decide whether the
given keyword matches the data or not. If the first block
has been corrupted, ccrypt will likely decide that the
key&acirc; <br>
word does not match; in such cases, the -m option can be
used to force ccrypt to decrypt the data anyway.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a file contains some
encrypted and some unencrypted data, or data encrypted with
two different keys, one should decrypt the entire file with
each applicable key, and then <br>
piece together the meaningful parts manually.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, decryption will only
produce meaningful results if the data is aligned correctly
along block boundaries. If the block boundary information
has been lost, one has to try <br>
all 32 possibilities.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION OF THE CIPHER <br>
Block ciphers operate on data segments of a fixed length.
For instance, the Rijndael block cipher used in ccrypt has a
block length of 32 bytes or 256 bits. Thus, this cipher <br>
encrypts 32 bytes at a time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Stream ciphers operate on data
streams of any length. There are several standard modes for
operating a block cipher as a stream cipher. One such
standard is Cipher Feedback <br>
(CFB), defined in NIST Special Publication 800-38A and ANSI
X3.106-1983. ccrypt implements a stream cipher by operating
the Rijndael block cipher in CFB mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Let P[i] and C[i] be the ith
block of the plaintext and ciphertext, respectively. CFB
mode specifies that</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C[i] = P[i] ^ E(k,C[i-1])</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here ^ denotes the bitwise
exclusive or function, and E(k,x) denotes the encryption of
the block x under the key k using the block cipher. Thus,
each block of the ciphertext is <br>
calculated from the corresponding block of plaintext and the
previous block of ciphertext. Note that in fact, each byte
of P[i] can be calculated from the corresponding byte of
<br>
C[i], so that the stream cipher can be applied to one byte
at a time. In particular, the stream length need not be a
multiple of the block size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Assuming that blocks are
numbered starting from 0, a special &quot;initial&quot;
ciphertext block C[-1] is needed to provide the base case
for the above formula. This value C[-1] is called <br>
the initialization vector or seed. The seed is chosen at
encryption time and written as the first block of the
encrypted stream. It is important that the seed is
unpredictable; <br>
in particular, the same seed should never by used more than
once. Otherwise, the two resulting ciphertext blocks C[0]
could be related by a simple xor to obtain information <br>
about the corresponding plaintext blocks P[0]. If
unpredictable seeds are used, CFB is provably as secure as
the underlying block cipher.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In ccrypt, the seed is
constructed as follows: first, a nonce is contructed by
hashing a combination of the host name, current time,
process id, and an internal counter into a <br>
28-byte value, using a cryptographic hash function. The
nonce is combined with a fixed four-byte &quot;magic
number&quot;, and the resulting 32-byte value is encrypted
by one round of the <br>
Rijndael block cipher with the given key. This encrypted
block is used as the seed and appended to the beginning of
the ciphertext. The use of the magic number allows ccrypt to
<br>
detect non-matching keys before decryption.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SECURITY <br>
ccrypt is believed to provide very strong cryptographic
security, equivalent to that of the Rijndael cipher with
256-bit block size and 256-bit key size. Another version of
the <br>
Rijndael cipher (with a smaller block size) is used in the
U.S. government&rsquo;s Advanced Encryption Standard (AES,
see http://www.nist.gov/aes). Therefore, this cipher is very
well <br>
studied and subject to intensive public scrutiny. This
scrutiny has a positive effect on the cipher&rsquo;s
security. In particular, if an exploitable weakness in this
cipher were <br>
ever discovered, this would become widely publicized.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In practical terms, the security
of ccrypt means that, without knowledge of the encryption
key, it is effectively impossible to obtain any information
about the plaintext from a <br>
given ciphertext. This is true even if a large number of
plaintext-ciphertext pairs are already known for the same
key. Moreover, because ccrypt uses a key size of 256 bits,
an <br>
exhaustive search of the key space is not feasible, at least
as long as sufficiently long keys are actually used in
practice. No cipher is secure if users choose insecure
key&acirc; <br>
words.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On the other hand, ccrypt does
not attempt to provide data integrity, i.e., it will not
attempt to detect whether the ciphertext was modified after
encryption. In particular, <br>
encrypted data can be truncated, leaving the corresponding
decrypted data also truncated, but otherwise consistent. If
one needs to ensure data integrity as well as secrecy, this
<br>
can be achieved by other methods. The recommended method is
to prepend a cryptographic hash (for instance, an SHA-1
hash) to the data before encryption.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ccrypt does not claim to provide
any particular safeguards against information leaking via
the local operating system. While reasonable precautions are
taken, there is no guaran&acirc; <br>
tee that keywords and plaintexts have been physically erased
after encryption in completed; parts of such data might
still exist in memory or on disk. ccrypt does not currently
<br>
use privileged memory pages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When encrypting files, ccrypt by
default accesses them in read-write mode. This normally
causes the original file to be physically overwritten, but
on some file systems, this <br>
might not be the case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the use of the -K
option is unsafe in a multiuser environment, because the
command line of a process is visible to other users running
the ps command. The use of the -E <br>
option is potentially unsafe for the same reason, although
recent versions of ps don&rsquo;t tend to display
environment information to other users. The use of the -T
option is unsafe <br>
for encryption because the original plaintext will remain in
unused sectors of the file system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EMACS PACKAGE <br>
There is an emacs package for reading and writing encrypted
files. (Note that this package currently only works with
emacs, not with xemacs.) This package hooks into the low-
<br>
level file I/O functions of emacs, prompting the user for a
password where appropriate. It is implemented in much the
same way as support for compressed files. If you have both
<br>
the ps-ccrypt and jka-compr packages installed, emacs can
open encrypted files and compressed files; however, it does
not currently work for files that are encrypted and
com&acirc; <br>
pressed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To use the package, simply load
ps-ccrypt, then edit as usual. When you open a file with the
&quot;.cpt&quot; extension, emacs will prompt you for a
password for the file. It will remem&acirc; <br>
ber the password for the buffer, and when you save the file
later, it will be automatically encrypted again (provided
you save it with a &quot;.cpt&quot; extension). Except for
the pass&acirc; <br>
word prompt, the operation of the package should be
transparent to the user. The command M-x
ccrypt-set-buffer-password can be used to change the current
password of a buffer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The simplest way to use this
package is to include the lines</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(setq load-path (cons
&quot;path&quot; load-path)) <br>
(require &rsquo;ps-ccrypt &quot;ps-ccrypt.el&quot;)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">in your .emacs file, where path
is the directory that holds the file ps-ccrypt.el.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Limitations of the emacs
package: there is no guarantee that unencrypted information
cannot leak to the file system; in fact, the package
sometimes writes unencrypted data to <br>
temporary files. However, auto-saved files are normally
treated correctly (i.e., encrypted). For details, see the
comments in the file ps-ccrypt.el.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The exit status is 0 on successful completion, and non-zero
otherwise. An exit status of 1 means illegal command line, 2
is out of memory or another system error, 3 is a fatal <br>
i/o error, 4 is a non-matching key or wrong file format, 6
is interrupt, 7 is mistyped key in --timid mode, 8 is a
non-fatal i/o error, and 9 means that no key was obtained
<br>
because the user failed to enter it, or because the
specified keyfile or environment variable could not be read.
An exit status of 10 means that the file specified by the
<br>
--keyref option could not be read, or did not match the
requested encryption key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fatal i/o errors are those that
occur while processing a file that is already open. Such
errors cause ccrypt to abort its operation immediately with
an exit status of 3. Non- <br>
fatal i/o errors are those that occur while handling files
that are not already open; typically, such errors are caused
by files that are missing, not readable, or can&rsquo;t be
cre&acirc; <br>
ated. When encountering a non-fatal i/o error, ccrypt simply
continues to process the next available input file. The exit
status of 8 is delayed until after all the files have <br>
been processed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Non-matching keys and wrong file
formats are also considered non-fatal errors, and cause
ccrypt to continue with processing the next available input
file. In this case, an exit <br>
status of 4 is given after all the files have been
processed. If there is a conflict between exit status 4 and
8, then 8 is returned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The former exit status 5
(&quot;wrong file format&quot;) has been eliminated, and is
now covered under exit status 4 (&quot;non-matching key or
wrong file format&quot;). Note that ccrypt does not <br>
really have a &quot;file format&quot; in the proper sense of
the word; any file of length at least 32 bytes is
potentially a valid encrypted file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
While ccrypt can handle keywords of arbitrary length, some
operating systems limit the length of an input line to 1024
characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The renaming of files (adding or
removing the .cpt suffix) can go wrong if a filename is
repeated on the command line. In this case, the file is only
encrypted/decrypted once, <br>
but the suffix may be added or removed several times. This
is because ccrypt thinks it encountered different hardlinks
for the same file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The --strictsuffix option can
behave in unexpected ways if one file has several hardlinks,
some of which have the suffix and some of which don&rsquo;t.
In this case, the inode will be <br>
encrypted/decrypted, but the suffix will be changed only for
those filenames that allow it. Similarly, if a file cannot
be renamed because a file of the given name already <br>
exists, the file may still be encrypted/decrypted if it has
another hardlink.</p>
