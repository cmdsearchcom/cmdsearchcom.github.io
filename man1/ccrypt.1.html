<b>ccrypt</b> is a utility for encrypting and decrypting files and streams. It
  was designed to replace the standard unix <b>crypt</b> utility, which is
  notorious for using a very weak encryption algorithm. <b>ccrypt</b> is based
  on the Rijndael block cipher, a version of which was also chosen by the U.S.
  government as the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES, see
  http://www.nist.gov/aes). This cipher is believed to provide very strong
  cryptographic security.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Unlike unix <b>crypt</b>, the algorithm provided by <b>ccrypt</b> is not
  symmetric, i.e., one must specify whether to encrypt or decrypt. The most
  common way to invoke <b>ccrypt</b> is via the commands <b>ccencrypt</b> and
  <b>ccdecrypt</b>.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Encryption and decryption depends on a keyword (or key phrase) supplied by the
  user. By default, the user is prompted to enter a keyword from the terminal.
  Keywords can consist of any number of characters, and all characters are
  significant (although <b>ccrypt</b> internally hashes the key to 256 bits).
  Longer keywords provide better security than short ones, since they are less
  likely to be discovered by exhaustive search.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="MODES"><a class="selflink" href="#MODES">MODES</a></h1>
<b>ccrypt</b> can operate in five different modes. If more than one mode is
  specified, the last one specified takes precedence. The aliases
  <b>ccencrypt</b>, <b>ccdecrypt</b>, and <b>ccat</b> are provided as a
  convenience; they are equivalent to <b>ccrypt -e</b>, <b>ccrypt -d</b>, and
  <b>ccrypt -c</b>, respectively.
<dl class="Bl-tag">

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="NOTES_ON_USAGE"><a class="selflink" href="#NOTES_ON_USAGE">NOTES
  ON USAGE</a></h1>
The user interface of <b>ccrypt</b> intentionally resembles that of GNU
  <b>gzip</b>, although it is not identical. When invoked with filename
  arguments, <b>ccrypt</b> normally modifies the files in place, overwriting
  their old content. Unlike <b>gzip</b>, the output is not first written to a
  temporary file; instead, the data is literally overwritten. For encryption,
  this is usually the desired behavior, since one does not want copies of the
  unencrypted data to remain in hidden places in the file system. The
  disadvantage is that if <b>ccrypt</b> is interrupted in the middle of writing
  to a file, the file will end up in a corrupted, partially encrypted state.
  However, in such cases it is possible to recover most of the data; see
  RECOVERING DATA FROM CORRUPTED FILES below. If you want to force <b>ccrypt</b>
  to use temporary files, use the <b>--tmpfiles</b> option.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
When <b>ccrypt</b> receives an interrupt signal (Ctrl-C) while updating a file
  in place, it does not exit immediately, but rather delays the exit until after
  it finishes writing to the current file. This is to prevent files from being
  partially overwritten and thus corrupted. If you want to force <b>ccrypt</b>
  to exit immediately, just press Ctrl-C twice quickly.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The encryption algorithm used by <b>ccrypt</b> uses a random seed that is
  different each time. As a result, encrypting the same file twice will never
  yield the same result. The advantage of this method is that similarities in
  plaintext do not lead to similarities in ciphertext; there is no way of
  telling whether the content of two encrypted files is similar or not.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Because of the use of a random seed, decrypting and re-encrypting a file with
  the same key will not lead to an identical file. It is primarily for this
  reason that <b>ccrypt</b> refuses to decrypt files with a non-matching key; if
  this were allowed, there would be no way afterwards to restore the original
  file, and the data would be irretrievably lost.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
When overwriting files, special care is taken with hard links and symbolic
  links. Each physical file (i.e., each inode) is processed at most once, no
  matter how many paths to it are encountered on the command line or in
  subdirectories traversed recursively. For each file that has multiple hard
  links, a warning is printed, to alert the user that not all paths to the file
  might have been properly renamed. Symbolic links are ignored except in cat
  mode, or unless the <b>-l</b> or <b>-R</b> option is given.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Unlike <b>gzip</b>, <b>ccrypt</b> does not complain about files that have
  improper suffixes. It is legal to doubly encrypt a file. It is also legal to
  decrypt a file that does not have the <b>.cpt</b> suffix, provided the file
  contains valid data for the given decryption key. Use the
  <b>--strictsuffix</b> option if you want to prevent <b>ccrypt</b> from
  encrypting files that already have a <b>.cpt</b> suffix.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Regarding encryption and compression: encrypted data is statistically
  indistinguishable from random data, and thus it cannot be compressed. But of
  course it is possible to compress the data first, then encrypt it. Suggested
  file suffixes are <b>.gz.cpt</b> or <b>.gzc</b>.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="RECOVERING_DATA_FROM_CORRUPTED_FILES"><a class="selflink" href="#RECOVERING_DATA_FROM_CORRUPTED_FILES">RECOVERING
  DATA FROM CORRUPTED FILES</a></h1>
Encrypted data might be corrupted for a number of reasons. For instance, a file
  might have been partially encrypted or decrypted if <b>ccrypt</b> was
  interrupted while processing the file. Or data might be corrupted by a
  software or hardware error, or during transmission over a network. The
  encryption algorithm used by <b>ccrypt</b> is designed to allow recovery from
  errors. In general, only a few bytes of data will be lost near where the error
  occurred.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Data encrypted by <b>ccrypt</b> can be thought of as a sequence of 32-byte
  blocks. To decrypt a particular block, <b>ccrypt</b> only needs to know the
  decryption key, the data of the block itself, and the data of the block
  immediately preceding it. <b>ccrypt</b> cannot tell whether a block is
  corrupted or not, except the very first block, which is special. Thus, if the
  encrypted data has been altered in the middle or near the end of a file,
  <b>ccrypt</b> can be run to decrypt it as usual, and most of the data will be
  decrypted correctly, except near where the corruption occurred.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The very first block of encrypted data is special, because it does not actually
  correspond to any plaintext data; this block holds the random seed generated
  at encryption time. <b>ccrypt</b> also uses the very first block to decide
  whether the given keyword matches the data or not. If the first block has been
  corrupted, <b>ccrypt</b> will likely decide that the keyword does not match;
  in such cases, the <b>-m</b> option can be used to force <b>ccrypt</b> to
  decrypt the data anyway.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If a file contains some encrypted and some unencrypted data, or data encrypted
  with two different keys, one should decrypt the entire file with each
  applicable key, and then piece together the meaningful parts manually.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Finally, decryption will only produce meaningful results if the data is aligned
  correctly along block boundaries. If the block boundary information has been
  lost, one has to try all 32 possibilities.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION_OF_THE_CIPHER"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION_OF_THE_CIPHER">DESCRIPTION
  OF THE CIPHER</a></h1>
<i>Block ciphers</i> operate on data segments of a fixed length. For instance,
  the Rijndael block cipher used in <b>ccrypt</b> has a block length of 32 bytes
  or 256 bits. Thus, this cipher encrypts 32 bytes at a time.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<i>Stream ciphers</i> operate on data streams of any length. There are several
  standard modes for operating a block cipher as a stream cipher. One such
  standard is <i>Cipher Feedback (CFB)</i>, defined in NIST Special Publication
  800-38A and ANSI X3.106-1983. <b>ccrypt</b> implements a stream cipher by
  operating the Rijndael block cipher in CFB mode.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Let <i>P[i]</i> and <i>C[i]</i> be the <i>i</i>th block of the plaintext and
  ciphertext, respectively. CFB mode specifies that
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">
    <pre>
<i>C[i] = P[i] ^ E(k,C[i-1])</i>
    </pre>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Here <i>^</i> denotes the bitwise exclusive or function, and <i>E(k,x)</i>
  denotes the encryption of the block <i>x</i> under the key <i>k</i> using the
  block cipher. Thus, each block of the ciphertext is calculated from the
  corresponding block of plaintext and the previous block of ciphertext. Note
  that in fact, each byte of <i>P[i]</i> can be calculated from the
  corresponding byte of <i>C[i]</i>, so that the stream cipher can be applied to
  one byte at a time. In particular, the stream length need not be a multiple of
  the block size.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Assuming that blocks are numbered starting from <i>0</i>, a special
  &quot;initial&quot; ciphertext block <i>C[-1]</i> is needed to provide the
  base case for the above formula. This value <i>C[-1]</i> is called the
  <i>initialization vector</i> or <i>seed</i>. The seed is chosen at encryption
  time and written as the first block of the encrypted stream. It is important
  that the seed is unpredictable; in particular, the same seed should never by
  used more than once. Otherwise, the two resulting ciphertext blocks
  <i>C[0]</i> could be related by a simple xor to obtain information about the
  corresponding plaintext blocks <i>P[0]</i>. If unpredictable seeds are used,
  CFB is provably as secure as the underlying block cipher.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
In <b>ccrypt</b>, the seed is constructed as follows: first, a nonce is
  contructed by hashing a combination of the host name, current time, process
  id, and an internal counter into a 28-byte value, using a cryptographic hash
  function. The nonce is combined with a fixed four-byte &quot;magic
  number&quot;, and the resulting 32-byte value is encrypted by one round of the
  Rijndael block cipher with the given key. This encrypted block is used as the
  seed and appended to the beginning of the ciphertext. The use of the magic
  number allows <b>ccrypt</b> to detect non-matching keys before decryption.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SECURITY"><a class="selflink" href="#SECURITY">SECURITY</a></h1>
<b>ccrypt</b> is believed to provide very strong cryptographic security,
  equivalent to that of the Rijndael cipher with 256-bit block size and 256-bit
  key size. Another version of the Rijndael cipher (with a smaller block size)
  is used in the U.S. government's Advanced Encryption Standard (AES, see
  http://www.nist.gov/aes). Therefore, this cipher is very well studied and
  subject to intensive public scrutiny. This scrutiny has a positive effect on
  the cipher's security. In particular, if an exploitable weakness in this
  cipher were ever discovered, this would become widely publicized.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
In practical terms, the security of <b>ccrypt</b> means that, without knowledge
  of the encryption key, it is effectively impossible to obtain any information
  about the plaintext from a given ciphertext. This is true even if a large
  number of plaintext-ciphertext pairs are already known for the same key.
  Moreover, because <b>ccrypt</b> uses a key size of 256 bits, an exhaustive
  search of the key space is not feasible, at least as long as sufficiently long
  keys are actually used in practice. No cipher is secure if users choose
  insecure keywords.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
On the other hand, <b>ccrypt</b> does not attempt to provide <i>data
  integrity</i>, i.e., it will not attempt to detect whether the ciphertext was
  modified after encryption. In particular, encrypted data can be truncated,
  leaving the corresponding decrypted data also truncated, but otherwise
  consistent. If one needs to ensure data integrity as well as secrecy, this can
  be achieved by other methods. The recommended method is to prepend a
  cryptographic hash (for instance, an SHA-1 hash) to the data before
  encryption.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>ccrypt</b> does not claim to provide any particular safeguards against
  information leaking via the local operating system. While reasonable
  precautions are taken, there is no guarantee that keywords and plaintexts have
  been physically erased after encryption in completed; parts of such data might
  still exist in memory or on disk. <b>ccrypt</b> does not currently use
  privileged memory pages.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
When encrypting files, <b>ccrypt</b> by default accesses them in read-write
  mode. This normally causes the original file to be physically overwritten, but
  on some file systems, this might not be the case.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Note that the use of the <b>-K</b> option is unsafe in a multiuser environment,
  because the command line of a process is visible to other users running the
  <b>ps</b> command. The use of the <b>-E</b> option is potentially unsafe for
  the same reason, although recent versions of <b>ps</b> don't tend to display
  environment information to other users. The use of the <b>-T</b> option is
  unsafe for encryption because the original plaintext will remain in unused
  sectors of the file system.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="EMACS_PACKAGE"><a class="selflink" href="#EMACS_PACKAGE">EMACS
  PACKAGE</a></h1>
There is an emacs package for reading and writing encrypted files. (Note that
  this package currently only works with emacs, not with xemacs.) This package
  hooks into the low-level file I/O functions of emacs, prompting the user for a
  password where appropriate. It is implemented in much the same way as support
  for compressed files. If you have both the ps-ccrypt and jka-compr packages
  installed, emacs can open encrypted files and compressed files; however, it
  does not currently work for files that are encrypted and compressed.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
To use the package, simply load ps-ccrypt, then edit as usual. When you open a
  file with the &quot;.cpt&quot; extension, emacs will prompt you for a password
  for the file. It will remember the password for the buffer, and when you save
  the file later, it will be automatically encrypted again (provided you save it
  with a &quot;.cpt&quot; extension). Except for the password prompt, the
  operation of the package should be transparent to the user. The command M-x
  ccrypt-set-buffer-password can be used to change the current password of a
  buffer.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The simplest way to use this package is to include the lines

Limitations of the emacs package: there is no guarantee that unencrypted
  information cannot leak to the file system; in fact, the package sometimes
  writes unencrypted data to temporary files. However, auto-saved files are
  normally treated correctly (i.e., encrypted). For details, see the comments in
  the file ps-ccrypt.el.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="EXIT_STATUS"><a class="selflink" href="#EXIT_STATUS">EXIT
  STATUS</a></h1>
The exit status is 0 on successful completion, and non-zero otherwise. An exit
  status of 1 means illegal command line, 2 is out of memory or another system
  error, 3 is a fatal i/o error, 4 is a non-matching key or wrong file format, 6
  is interrupt, 7 is mistyped key in <b>--timid</b> mode, 8 is a non-fatal i/o
  error, and 9 means that no key was obtained because the user failed to enter
  it, or because the specified keyfile or environment variable could not be
  read. An exit status of 10 means that the file specified by the
  <b>--keyref</b> option could not be read, or did not match the requested
  encryption key.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Fatal i/o errors are those that occur while processing a file that is already
  open. Such errors cause ccrypt to abort its operation immediately with an exit
  status of 3. Non-fatal i/o errors are those that occur while handling files
  that are not already open; typically, such errors are caused by files that are
  missing, not readable, or can't be created. When encountering a non-fatal i/o
  error, ccrypt simply continues to process the next available input file. The
  exit status of 8 is delayed until after all the files have been processed.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Non-matching keys and wrong file formats are also considered non-fatal errors,
  and cause ccrypt to continue with processing the next available input file. In
  this case, an exit status of 4 is given after all the files have been
  processed. If there is a conflict between exit status 4 and 8, then 8 is
  returned.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The former exit status 5 (&quot;wrong file format&quot;) has been eliminated,
  and is now covered under exit status 4 (&quot;non-matching key or wrong file
  format&quot;). Note that ccrypt does not really have a &quot;file format&quot;
  in the proper sense of the word; any file of length at least 32 bytes is
  potentially a valid encrypted file.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="BUGS"><a class="selflink" href="#BUGS">BUGS</a></h1>
While <b>ccrypt</b> can handle keywords of arbitrary length, some operating
  systems limit the length of an input line to 1024 characters.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The renaming of files (adding or removing the <b>.cpt</b> suffix) can go wrong
  if a filename is repeated on the command line. In this case, the file is only
  encrypted/decrypted once, but the suffix may be added or removed several
  times. This is because <b>ccrypt</b> thinks it encountered different hardlinks
  for the same file.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The <b>--strictsuffix</b> option can behave in unexpected ways if one file has
  several hardlinks, some of which have the suffix and some of which don't. In
  this case, the inode will be encrypted/decrypted, but the suffix will be
  changed only for those filenames that allow it. Similarly, if a file cannot be
  renamed because a file of the given name already exists, the file may still be
  encrypted/decrypted if it has another hardlink.
