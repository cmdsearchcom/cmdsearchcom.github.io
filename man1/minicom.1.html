<b>minicom</b> [options] [<i>configuration</i>]
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>minicom</b> is a communication program which somewhat resembles the shareware
  program TELIX but is free with source code and runs under most Unices.
  Features include dialing directory with auto-redial, support for UUCP-style
  lock files on serial devices, a separate script language interpreter, capture
  to file, multiple users with individual configurations, and more.

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-s, --setup</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>S</b>etup. Root edits the system-wide defaults in
      /etc/minirc.dfl with this option. When it is used, minicom does <i>not</i>
      initialize, but puts you directly into the configuration menu. This is
      very handy if minicom refuses to start up because your system has changed,
      or for the first time you run minicom. For most systems, reasonable
      defaults are already compiled in.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-o, --noinit</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Do not initialize. Minicom will skip the initialization
      code. This option is handy if you quit from minicom without resetting, and
      then want to restart a session. It is potentially dangerous though: no
      check for lock files etc. is made, so a normal user could interfere with
      things like UUCP... maybe this will be taken out later. For now it is
      assumed, that users who are given access to a modem are responsible enough
      for their actions.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-m, --metakey</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Override command-key with the Meta or ALT key. This is the
      default in 1.80 and it can also be configured in one of minicom's menus,
      but if you use different terminals all the time, of which some don't have
      a Meta or ALT key, it's handy to set the default command key to Ctrl-A and
      use this option when you have a keyboard supporting Meta or ALT keys.
      Minicom assumes that your Meta key sends the ESC prefix, not the other
      variant that sets the highest bit of the character.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-M, --metakey8</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Same as -m, but assumes that your Meta key sets the 8th bit
      of the character high (sends 128 + character code).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-z, --statline</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Use terminal status line. This only works on terminals that
      support it and that have the relevant information in their <i>termcap</i>
      or <i>terminfo</i> database entry.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-l, --ansi</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>L</b>iteral translation of characters with the high bit
      set. With this flag on, minicom will try to translate the IBM line
      characters to ASCII. Many PC-unix clones will display character correctly
      without translation (Linux in a special mode, Coherent and SCO).</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">

      Televideo's, have rotten attribute handling (serial instead of parallel).
      By default, minicom uses '-a on', but if you are using such a terminal you
      can (must!) supply the option '-a off'. The trailing 'on' or 'off' is
      needed.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-t, --term=TERM</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>T</b>erminal type. With this flag, you can override the
      environment TERM variable. This is handy for use in the MINICOM
      environment variable; one can create a special termcap entry for use with
      minicom on the console, that initializes the screen to raw mode so that in
      conjunction with the -l flag, the IBM line characters are displayed
      untranslated.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-c, --color=on/off</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>C</b>olor usage. Some terminals (such as the Linux
      console) support color with the standard ANSI escape sequences. Because
      there is apparently no termcap support for color, these escape sequences
      are hard-coded into minicom. Therefore this option is off by default. You
      can turn it on with '-c on'. This, and the '-m' option, are good
      candidates to put into the MINICOM environment variable.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">

      they are all tagged for dialing. You can also specify multiple names or
      index numbers by separating them with commas. The dialing will start from
      the first entry specified after all other program initialization
      procedures are completed.</dd>

<div style="margin-left: 0.50in;">When <b>minicom</b> starts, it first searches
  the MINICOM environment variable for command-line arguments, which can be
  over-ridden on the command line. Thus, if you have done
<div class="Pp"></div>

<div class="Pp"></div>
export MINICOM
<div class="Pp"></div>

<div class="Pp"></div>
or the equivalent, and start minicom, minicom will assume that your terminal
  <i>has</i> a Meta or &lt;ALT&gt; key and that color is supported. If you then
  log in from a terminal without color support, and you have set MINICOM in your
  startup (.profile or equivalent) file, and don't want to re-set your
  environment variable, you can type 'minicom -c off' and run without color
  support for that session.</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>configuration</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The <i>configuration</i> argument is more interesting.
      Normally, minicom gets its defaults from a file called
      &quot;minirc.dfl&quot;. If you however give an argument to minicom, it
      will try to get its defaults from a file called &quot;minirc.
      <i>configuration</i>&quot;. So it is possible to create multiple
      configuration files, for different ports, different users etc. Most
      sensible is to use device names, such as tty1, tty64, sio2 etc. If a user
      creates his own configuration file, it will show up in his home directory
      as &quot;.minirc.dfl&quot; or &quot;.minirc.

Minicom is window based. To pop-up a window with the function you want, press
  Control-A (from now on, we will use C-A to mean Control-A), and then the
  function key (a-z or A-Z). By pressing C-A first and then 'z', a help screen
  comes up with a short summary of all commands. This escape key can be altered
  when minicom is configured (-s option or C-A O), but we'll stick to Control-A
  for now.

The screen is divided into two portions: the upper 24 lines are the
  terminal-emulator screen. In this window, ANSI or VT100 escape sequences are
  interpreted. If there is a line left at the bottom, a status line is placed
  there. If this is not possible the status line will be showed every time you
  press C-A. On terminals that have a special status line that will be used if
  the termcap information is complete <i>and</i> the <b>-k</b> flag has been
  given.

By pressing C-A D the program puts you in the dialing directory. Select a
  command by pressing the capitalized letter or moving cursor right/left with
  the arrow keys or the h/l keys and pressing Enter. You can add, delete or edit
  entries and move them up and down in the directory list. By choosing
  &quot;dial&quot; the phone numbers of the tagged entries, or if nothing is
  tagged, the number of the highlighted entry will be dialed. While the modem is
  dialing, you can press escape to cancel dialing. Any other key will close the
  dial window, but won't cancel the dialing itself. Your dialing directory will
  be saved into the file &quot;.dialdir&quot; in your home directory. You can
  scroll up and down with the arrow keys, but you can also scroll complete pages
  by pressing the PageUp or PageDown key. If you don't have those, use Control-B
  (Backward) and Control-F (Forward). You can use the space bar to <b>tag</b> a

<div style="margin-left: 0.25in;">Protocols defined here will show up when C-A

  will show up in the menu. &quot;Program&quot; is the path to the protocol.
  &quot;Name&quot; after that defines if the program needs an argument, e.g. a
  file to be transmitted. U/D defines if this entry should show up in the upload
  or the download menu. Fullscr defines if the program should run full screen,
  or that minicom will only show it's stderr in a window. IO-Red defines if
  minicom should attach the program's standard in and output to the modem port
  or not. &quot;Multi&quot; tells the filename selection window whether or not
  the protocol can send multiple files with one command. It has no effect on
  download protocols, and it is also ignored with upload protocols if you don't
  use the filename selection window. The old sz and rz are not full screen, and
  have IO-Red set. However, there are curses based versions of at least rz that
  do not want their stdin and stdout redirected, and run full screen. All file
  transfer protocols are run with the UID of the user, and not with UID=root.
  '%l', '%f' and '%b' can be used on the command line as with kermit. Within
  this menu you can also define if you want to use the filename selection window
  when prompted for files to upload, and if you like to be prompted for the
  download directory every time the automatic download is started. If you leave
  the download directory prompt disabled, the download directory defined in the
  file and directory menu is used.</div>

      a symlink to the real device.
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    If you have modems connected to two or more serial ports, you may specify
      all of them here in a list separated by space, comma or semicolon. When
      Minicom starts, it checks the list until it finds an available modem and
      uses that one. (However, you can't specify different init strings to

    To use a UNIX socket for communication the device name must be prefixed with
      &quot;unix#&quot; following by the full path and the filename of the
      socket. Minicom will then try to connect to this socket as a client. As
      long as it cannot connect to the socket it stays 'offline'. As soon as the

<b>Modem and Dialing</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div style="margin-left: 0.25in;">Here, the parameters for your modem are
  defined. I will not explain this further because the defaults are for generic
  Hayes modems, and should work always. This file is not a Hayes tutorial :-)
  The only things worth noticing are that control characters can be sent by
  prefixing them with a '^', in which '^^' means '^' itself, and the '\'
  character must also be doubled as '\\', because backslash is used specially in
  the macro definitions. Some options however, don't have much to do with the
  modem but more with the behaviour of minicom itself:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>M - Dial time</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The number of seconds before minicom times out if no
      connection is established.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>N - Delay before redial</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Minicom will redial if no connection was made, but it first
      waits some time.</dd>

  <dd class="It-tag">Maximum number of times that minicom attempts to dial.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>P - Drop DTR time</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If you set this to 0, minicom hangs up by sending a
      Hayes-type hangup sequence. If you specify a non-zero value, the hangup
      will be done by dropping the DTR line. The value tells in seconds how long
      DTR will be kept down.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Q - Auto bps detect</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If this is on, minicom tries to match the dialed party's

</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>R - Modem has DCD line</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If your modem, and your O/S both support the DCD line (that
      goes 'high' when a connection is made) minicom will use it. When you have
      this option on, minicom will also NOT start dialing while you are already
      online.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>S - Status line shows DTE speed / line speed</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">You can toggle the status line to show either the DTE speed
      (the speed which minicom uses to communicate with your modem) or the line
      speed (the speed that your modem uses on the line to communicate with the
      other modem). Notice that the line speed may change during the connection,
      but you will still only see the initial speed that the modems started the
      connection with. This is because the modem doesn't tell the program if the
      speed is changed. Also, to see the line speed, you need to have the modem
      set to show it in the connect string. Otherwise you will only see 0 as the
      line speed.</dd>

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="STATUS_LINE"><a class="selflink" href="#STATUS_LINE">STATUS
  LINE</a></h1>
The status line has several indicators, that speak for themselves. The
  mysterious APP or NOR indicator probably needs explanation. The VT100 cursor
  keys can be in two modes: applications mode and cursor mode. This is
  controlled by an escape sequence. If you find that the cursor keys do not work
  in, say, vi when you're logged in using minicom then you can see with this
  indicator whether the cursor keys are in applications or cursor mode. You can
  toggle the two with the C-A I key. If the cursor keys then work, it's probably
  an error in the remote system's termcap initialization strings (is).
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="LOCALES"><a class="selflink" href="#LOCALES">LOCALES</a></h1>
Minicom has support for local languages. This means you can change most of the
  English messages and other strings to another language by setting the
  environment variable LANG.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="MISC"><a class="selflink" href="#MISC">MISC</a></h1>
If minicom is hung, kill it with SIGTERM . (This means kill -15, or since
  sigterm is default, just plain &quot;kill &lt;minicompid&gt;&quot;. This will
  cause a graceful exit of minicom, doing resets and everything. You may kill
  minicom from a script with the command &quot;! killall -9 minicom&quot;
  without hanging up the line. Without the -9 parameter, minicom first hangs up
  before exiting.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Since a lot of escape sequences begin with ESC (Arrow up is ESC [ A), Minicom
  does not know if the escape character it gets is you pressing the escape key,
  or part of a sequence.
<div class="Pp"></div>
An old version of Minicom, V1.2, solved this in a rather crude way: to get the
  escape key, you had to press it <i>twice</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
As of release 1.3 this has bettered a little: now a 1-second timeout is builtin,
  like in vi. For systems that have the select() system call the timeout is 0.5
  seconds. And... surprise: a special Linux-dependent <b>hack</b> :-) was added.
  Now, minicom can separate the escape key and escape-sequences. To see how
  dirty this was done, look into wkeys.c. But it works like a charm!
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="FILES"><a class="selflink" href="#FILES">FILES</a></h1>
Minicom keeps it's configuration files in one directory, usually
  /var/lib/minicom, /usr/local/etc or /etc. To find out what default directory
  minicom has compiled in, issue the command <i>minicom -h</i>. You'll probably
  also find the demo files for <b>runscript</b>(1), and the examples of
  character conversion tables either there or in the subdirectories of
  /usr/doc/minicom*. The conversion tables are named something like mc.* in that
  directory, but you probably want to copy the ones you need in your home
  directory as something beginning with a dot.
