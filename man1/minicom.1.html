<p>MINICOM(1) Version 2.6.2 MINICOM(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
minicom - friendly serial communication program</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
minicom [options] [configuration]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
minicom is a communication program which somewhat resembles
the shareware program TELIX but is free with source code and
runs under most Unices. Features include dialing
direc&acirc; <br>
tory with auto-redial, support for UUCP-style lock files on
serial devices, a separate script language interpreter,
capture to file, multiple users with individual
configura&acirc; <br>
tions, and more.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMAND-LINE <br>
-s, --setup <br>
Setup. Root edits the system-wide defaults in
/etc/minirc.dfl with this option. When it is used, minicom
does not initialize, but puts you directly into the
configuration <br>
menu. This is very handy if minicom refuses to start up
because your system has changed, or for the first time you
run minicom. For most systems, reasonable defaults are <br>
already compiled in.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o, --noinit <br>
Do not initialize. Minicom will skip the initialization
code. This option is handy if you quit from minicom without
resetting, and then want to restart a session. It is <br>
potentially dangerous though: no check for lock files etc.
is made, so a normal user could interfere with things like
UUCP... maybe this will be taken out later. For now it <br>
is assumed, that users who are given access to a modem are
responsible enough for their actions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m, --metakey <br>
Override command-key with the Meta or ALT key. This is the
default in 1.80 and it can also be configured in one of
minicom&rsquo;s menus, but if you use different terminals
all <br>
the time, of which some don&rsquo;t have a Meta or ALT key,
it&rsquo;s handy to set the default command key to Ctrl-A
and use this option when you have a keyboard supporting Meta
or ALT <br>
keys. Minicom assumes that your Meta key sends the ESC
prefix, not the other variant that sets the highest bit of
the character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M, --metakey8 <br>
Same as -m, but assumes that your Meta key sets the 8th bit
of the character high (sends 128 + character code).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z, --statline <br>
Use terminal status line. This only works on terminals that
support it and that have the relevant information in their
termcap or terminfo database entry.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, --ansi <br>
Literal translation of characters with the high bit set.
With this flag on, minicom will try to translate the IBM
line characters to ASCII. Many PC-unix clones will display
<br>
character correctly without translation (Linux in a special
mode, Coherent and SCO).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L, --iso <br>
Ditto but assume screen uses an ISO8859 character set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w, --wrap <br>
Turns line-wrap on at startup by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H, --displayhex <br>
Turn on output in hex mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a, --attrib=on/off <br>
Attribute usage. Some terminals, notably Televideo&rsquo;s,
have rotten attribute handling (serial instead of parallel).
By default, minicom uses &rsquo;-a on&rsquo;, but if you are
using <br>
such a terminal you can (must!) supply the option &rsquo;-a
off&rsquo;. The trailing &rsquo;on&rsquo; or
&rsquo;off&rsquo; is needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t, --term=TERM <br>
Terminal type. With this flag, you can override the
environment TERM variable. This is handy for use in the
MINICOM environment variable; one can create a special
termcap <br>
entry for use with minicom on the console, that initializes
the screen to raw mode so that in conjunction with the -l
flag, the IBM line characters are displayed untrans&acirc;
<br>
lated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --color=on/off <br>
Color usage. Some terminals (such as the Linux console)
support color with the standard ANSI escape sequences.
Because there is apparently no termcap support for color,
<br>
these escape sequences are hard-coded into minicom.
Therefore this option is off by default. You can turn it on
with &rsquo;-c on&rsquo;. This, and the &rsquo;-m&rsquo;
option, are good candidates <br>
to put into the MINICOM environment variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S, --script=SCRIPT <br>
script. Run the named script at startup. So far, passing
username and password to a startup script is not supported.
If you also use the -d option to start dialing at <br>
startup, the -S script will be run BEFORE dialing the
entries specified with -d.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --dial=ENTRY <br>
Dial an entry from the dialing directory on startup. You can
specify an index number, but also a substring of the name of
the entry. If you specify a name that has multiple <br>
entries in the directory, they are all tagged for dialing.
You can also specify multiple names or index numbers by
separating them with commas. The dialing will start from
<br>
the first entry specified after all other program
initialization procedures are completed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, --ptty=TTYP <br>
Pseudo terminal to use. This overrides the terminal port
defined in the configuration files, but only if it is a
pseudo TTY. The filename supplied must be of the form <br>
(/dev/)tty[p-z/][0-f], (/dev/)pts[p-z/][0-f] or
(/dev/)pty[p-z/][0-f]. For example, /dev/ttyp1, pts/0 or
/dev/ptyp2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C, --capturefile=FILE <br>
filename. Open capture file at startup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T, --disabletime <br>
Disable the display of the online time in the status
bar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b, --baudrate <br>
Specify the baud rate, overriding the value given in the
configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D, --device <br>
Specify the device, overriding the value given in the
configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R, --remotecharset <br>
Specify the character set of the remote system is using and
convert it to the character set of the local side. Example
might be &rsquo;latin1&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-7, --7bit <br>
7bit mode for terminals which aren&rsquo;t 8bit capable.
8bit is default if the environment is configured for this
via LANG or LC_ALL, 7bit otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-8, --8bit <br>
8bit characters pass through without any modification.
&rsquo;Continuous&rsquo; means no locate/attribute control
sequences are inserted without real change of
locate/attribute. This <br>
mode is to display 8bit multi-byte characters such as
Japanese. Not needed in every language with 8bit characters.
(For example displaying Finnish text doesn&rsquo;t need
this.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Display help and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --version <br>
Print the minicom version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When minicom starts, it first
searches the MINICOM environment variable for command-line
arguments, which can be over-ridden on the command line.
Thus, if you have done</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MINICOM=&rsquo;-m -c on&rsquo;
<br>
export MINICOM <br>
or the equivalent, and start minicom, minicom will assume
that your terminal has a Meta or &lt;ALT&gt; key and that
color is supported. If you then log in from a terminal
without <br>
color support, and you have set MINICOM in your startup
(.profile or equivalent) file, and don&rsquo;t want to
re-set your environment variable, you can type
&rsquo;minicom -c off&rsquo; and <br>
run without color support for that session.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">configuration <br>
The configuration argument is more interesting. Normally,
minicom gets its defaults from a file called
&quot;minirc.dfl&quot;. If you however give an argument to
minicom, it will try <br>
to get its defaults from a file called
&quot;minirc.configuration&quot;. So it is possible to
create multiple configuration files, for different ports,
different users etc. Most sen&acirc; <br>
sible is to use device names, such as tty1, tty64, sio2 etc.
If a user creates his own configuration file, it will show
up in his home directory as &quot;.minirc.dfl&quot; or <br>
&quot;.minirc.configuration&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USE <br>
Minicom is window based. To pop-up a window with the
function you want, press Control-A (from now on, we will use
C-A to mean Control-A), and then the function key (a-z or
A-Z). <br>
By pressing C-A first and then &rsquo;z&rsquo;, a help
screen comes up with a short summary of all commands. This
escape key can be altered when minicom is configured (-s
option or C-A O), <br>
but we&rsquo;ll stick to Control-A for now.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For every menu the next keys can
be used: <br>
UP arrow-up or &rsquo;k&rsquo; <br>
DOWN arrow-down or &rsquo;j&rsquo; <br>
LEFT arrow-left or &rsquo;h&rsquo; <br>
RIGHT arrow-right or &rsquo;l&rsquo; <br>
CHOOSE Enter <br>
CANCEL ESCape.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The screen is divided into two
portions: the upper 24 lines are the terminal-emulator
screen. In this window, ANSI or VT100 escape sequences are
interpreted. If there is a line <br>
left at the bottom, a status line is placed there. If this
is not possible the status line will be showed every time
you press C-A. On terminals that have a special status line
<br>
that will be used if the termcap information is complete and
the -k flag has been given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Possible commands are listed
next, in alphabetical order. <br>
C-A Pressing C-A a second time will just send a C-A to the
remote system. If you have changed your &quot;escape
character&quot; to something other than C-A, this works
analogously for <br>
that character. <br>
A Toggle &rsquo;Add Linefeed&rsquo; on/off. If it is on, a
linefeed is added before every carriage return displayed on
the screen. <br>
B Gives you a scroll back buffer. You can scroll up with u,
down with d, a page up with b, a page down with f, and if
you have them the arrow and page up/page down keys can <br>
also be used. You can search for text in the buffer with s
(case-sensitive) or S (case-insensitive). N will find the
next occurrence of the string. c will enter citation <br>
mode. A text cursor appears and you specify the start line
by hitting Enter key. Then scroll back mode will finish and
the contents with prefix &rsquo;&gt;&rsquo; will be sent.
<br>
C Clears the screen. <br>
D Dial a number, or go to the dialing directory. <br>
E Toggle local echo on and off (if your version of minicom
supports it). <br>
F A break signal is sent to the modem. <br>
G Run script (Go). Runs a login script. <br>
H Hangup. <br>
I Toggle the type of escape sequence that the cursor keys
send between normal and applications mode. (See also the
comment about the status line below). <br>
J Jump to a shell. On return, the whole screen will be
redrawn. <br>
K Clears the screen, runs kermit and redraws the screen upon
return. <br>
L Turn Capture file on off. If turned on, all output sent to
the screen will be captured in the file too. <br>
M Sends the modem initialization string. If you are online
and the DCD line setting is on, you are asked for
confirmation before the modem is initialized. <br>
N Toggle between three states, whether each line is prefixed
with current date and time, a timestamp is added every
second, or no timestamps. <br>
O Configure minicom. Puts you in the configuration menu.
<br>
P Communication Parameters. Allows you to change the bps
rate, parity and number of bits. <br>
Q Exit minicom without resetting the modem. If macros
changed and were not saved, you will have a chance to do so.
<br>
R Receive files. Choose from various protocols (external).
If you have the filename selection window and the prompt for
download directory enabled, you&rsquo;ll get a selection
win&acirc; <br>
dow for choosing the directory for downloading. Otherwise
the download directory defined in the Filenames and paths
menu will be used. <br>
S Send files. Choose the protocol like you do with the
receive command. If you don&rsquo;t have the filename
selection window enabled (in the File transfer protocols
menu), you&rsquo;ll <br>
just have to write the filename(s) in a dialog window. If
you have the selection window enabled, a window will pop up
showing the filenames in your upload directory. You can <br>
tag and untag filenames by pressing spacebar, and move the
cursor up and down with the cursor keys or j/k. The selected
filenames are shown highlighted. Directory names are <br>
shown [within brackets] and you can move up or down in the
directory tree by pressing the spacebar twice. Finally, send
the files by pressing ENTER or quit by pressing ESC. <br>
T Choose Terminal emulation: Ansi(color) or vt100. You can
also change the backspace key here, turn the status line on
or off, and define delay (in milliseconds) after each <br>
newline if you need that. <br>
W Toggle line-wrap on/off. <br>
X Exit minicom, reset modem. If macros changed and were not
saved, you will have a chance to do so. <br>
Y Paste a file. Reads a file and sends its contests just as
if it would be typed in. <br>
Z Pop up the help screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIALING DIRECTORY <br>
By pressing C-A D the program puts you in the dialing
directory. Select a command by pressing the capitalized
letter or moving cursor right/left with the arrow keys or
the h/l <br>
keys and pressing Enter. You can add, delete or edit entries
and move them up and down in the directory list. By choosing
&quot;dial&quot; the phone numbers of the tagged entries, or
if <br>
nothing is tagged, the number of the highlighted entry will
be dialed. While the modem is dialing, you can press escape
to cancel dialing. Any other key will close the dial
win&acirc; <br>
dow, but won&rsquo;t cancel the dialing itself. Your dialing
directory will be saved into the file &quot;.dialdir&quot;
in your home directory. You can scroll up and down with the
arrow keys, <br>
but you can also scroll complete pages by pressing the
PageUp or PageDown key. If you don&rsquo;t have those, use
Control-B (Backward) and Control-F (Forward). You can use
the space <br>
bar to tag a number of entries and minicom will rotate
trough this list if a connection can&rsquo;t be made. A
&rsquo;&gt;&rsquo; symbol is drawn in the directory before
the names of the tagged <br>
entries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;edit&quot; menu speaks
for itself, but I will discuss it briefly here. <br>
A - Name The name for this entry <br>
B - Number <br>
and its telephone number. <br>
C - Dial string # <br>
Which specific dial string you want to use to connect. There
are three different dial strings (prefixes and suffixes)
that can be configured in the Modem and dialing <br>
menu. <br>
D - Local echo <br>
can be on or off for this system (if your version of minicom
supports it). <br>
E - Script <br>
The script that must be executed after a successful
connection is made (see the manual for runscript) <br>
F - Username <br>
The username that is passed to the runscript program. It is
passed in the environment string &quot;$LOGIN&quot;. <br>
G - Password <br>
The password is passed as &quot;$PASS&quot;. <br>
H - Terminal Emulation <br>
Use ANSI or VT100 emulation. <br>
I - Backspace key sends <br>
What code (Backspace or Delete) the backspace key sends.
<br>
J - Linewrap <br>
Can be on or off. <br>
K - Line settings <br>
Bps rate, bits, parity and number of stop bits to use for
this connection. You can choose current for the speed, so
that it will use whatever speed is being used at <br>
that moment (useful if you have multiple modems). <br>
L - Conversion table <br>
You may specify a character conversion table to be loaded
whenever this entry answers, before running the login
script. If this field is blank, the conversion table <br>
stays unchanged. <br>
The edit menu also shows the latest date and time when you
called this entry and the total number of calls there, but
doesn&rsquo;t let you change them. They are updated
automatically <br>
when you connect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The moVe command lets you move
the highlighted entry up or down in the dialing directory
with the up/down arrow keys or the k and j keys. Press Enter
or ESC to end moving the <br>
entry.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION <br>
By pressing C-A O you will be thrown into the setup
menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Filenames and paths <br>
This menu defines your default directories. <br>
A - Download directory <br>
where the downloaded files go to. <br>
B - Upload directory <br>
where the uploaded files are read from. <br>
C - Script directory <br>
Where you keep your login scripts. <br>
D - Script program <br>
Which program to use as the script interpreter. Defaults to
the program &quot;runscript&quot;, but if you want to use
something else (eg, /bin/sh or &quot;expect&quot;) it is
possible. Stdin <br>
and stdout are connected to the modem, stderr to the screen.
<br>
If the path is relative (ie, does not start with a slash)
then it&rsquo;s relative to your home directory, except for
the script interpreter. <br>
E - Kermit program <br>
Where to find the executable for kermit, and it&rsquo;s
options. Some simple macro&rsquo;s can be used on the
command line: &rsquo;%l&rsquo; is expanded to the complete
filename of the dial out- <br>
device, &rsquo;%f&rsquo; is expanded to the serial port file
descriptor and &rsquo;%b&rsquo; is expanded to the current
serial port speed. <br>
F - Logging options <br>
Options to configure the logfile writing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A - File name <br>
Here you can enter the name of the logfile. The file will be
written in your home directory, and the default value is
&quot;minicom.log&quot;. If you blank the name, all
log&acirc; <br>
ging is turned off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">B - Log connects and hangups
<br>
This option defines whether or not the logfile is written
when the remote end answers the call or hangs up. Or when
you give the hangup command yourself or leave <br>
minicom without hangup while online.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C - Log file transfers <br>
Do you want log entries of receiving and sending files. <br>
The &rsquo;log&rsquo; command in the scripts is not affected
by logging options B and C. It is always executed, if you
just have the name of the log file defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File Transfer Protocols <br>
Protocols defined here will show up when C-A s/r is pressed.
&quot;Name&quot; in the beginning of the line is the name
that will show up in the menu. &quot;Program&quot; is the
path to the proto&acirc; <br>
col. &quot;Name&quot; after that defines if the program
needs an argument, e.g. a file to be transmitted. U/D
defines if this entry should show up in the upload or the
download menu. <br>
Fullscr defines if the program should run full screen, or
that minicom will only show it&rsquo;s stderr in a window.
IO-Red defines if minicom should attach the program&rsquo;s
standard in <br>
and output to the modem port or not. &quot;Multi&quot; tells
the filename selection window whether or not the protocol
can send multiple files with one command. It has no effect
on down&acirc; <br>
load protocols, and it is also ignored with upload protocols
if you don&rsquo;t use the filename selection window. The
old sz and rz are not full screen, and have IO-Red set.
How&acirc; <br>
ever, there are curses based versions of at least rz that do
not want their stdin and stdout redirected, and run full
screen. All file transfer protocols are run with the UID
<br>
of the user, and not with UID=root. &rsquo;%l&rsquo;,
&rsquo;%f&rsquo; and &rsquo;%b&rsquo; can be used on the
command line as with kermit. Within this menu you can also
define if you want to use the filename <br>
selection window when prompted for files to upload, and if
you like to be prompted for the download directory every
time the automatic download is started. If you leave the
<br>
download directory prompt disabled, the download directory
defined in the file and directory menu is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Serial port setup <br>
A - Serial device <br>
/dev/tty1 or /dev/ttyS1 for most people. /dev/cua&lt;n&gt;
is still possible under GNU/Linux, but no longer recommended
as these devices are obsolete and many systems with
ker&acirc; <br>
nel 2.2.x or newer don&rsquo;t have them. Use
/dev/ttyS&lt;n&gt; instead. You may also have /dev/modem as
a symlink to the real device. <br>
If you have modems connected to two or more serial ports,
you may specify all of them here in a list separated by
space, comma or semicolon. When Minicom starts, it checks
<br>
the list until it finds an available modem and uses that
one. (However, you can&rsquo;t specify different init
strings to them... at least not yet.) <br>
To use a UNIX socket for communication the device name must
be prefixed with &quot;unix#&quot; following by the full
path and the filename of the socket. Minicom will then try
to <br>
connect to this socket as a client. As long as it cannot
connect to the socket it stays &rsquo;offline&rsquo;. As
soon as the connection establishes, minicom goes
&rsquo;online&rsquo;. If the <br>
server closes the socket, minicom switches to
&rsquo;offline&rsquo; again. <br>
B - Lock file location <br>
On most systems This should be /usr/spool/uucp. GNU/Linux
systems use /var/lock. If this directory does not exist,
minicom will not attempt to use lockfiles. <br>
C - Callin program <br>
If you have a uugetty or something on your serial port, it
could be that you want a program to be run to switch the
modem cq. port into dialin/dialout mode. This is the <br>
program to get into dialin mode. <br>
D - Callout program <br>
And this to get into dialout mode. <br>
E - Bps/Par/Bits <br>
Default parameters at startup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If one of the entries is left
blank, it will not be used. So if you don&rsquo;t care about
locking, and don&rsquo;t have a getty running on your
modemline, entries B - D should be left <br>
blank.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Modem and Dialing <br>
Here, the parameters for your modem are defined. I will not
explain this further because the defaults are for generic
Hayes modems, and should work always. This file is not a
<br>
Hayes tutorial :-) The only things worth noticing are that
control characters can be sent by prefixing them with a
&rsquo;^&rsquo;, in which &rsquo;^^&rsquo; means
&rsquo;^&rsquo; itself, and the &rsquo;&acute; character
<br>
must also be doubled as &rsquo;\&rsquo;, because backslash
is used specially in the macro definitions. Some options
however, don&rsquo;t have much to do with the modem but more
with the behav&acirc; <br>
iour of minicom itself: <br>
M - Dial time <br>
The number of seconds before minicom times out if no
connection is established. <br>
N - Delay before redial <br>
Minicom will redial if no connection was made, but it first
waits some time. <br>
O - Number of tries <br>
Maximum number of times that minicom attempts to dial. <br>
P - Drop DTR time <br>
If you set this to 0, minicom hangs up by sending a
Hayes-type hangup sequence. If you specify a non-zero value,
the hangup will be done by dropping the DTR line. The <br>
value tells in seconds how long DTR will be kept down. <br>
Q - Auto bps detect <br>
If this is on, minicom tries to match the dialed
party&rsquo;s speed. With most modern modems this is NOT
desirable, since the modem buffers the data and converts the
speed. <br>
R - Modem has DCD line <br>
If your modem, and your O/S both support the DCD line (that
goes &rsquo;high&rsquo; when a connection is made) minicom
will use it. When you have this option on, minicom will also
NOT <br>
start dialing while you are already online. <br>
S - Status line shows DTE speed / line speed <br>
You can toggle the status line to show either the DTE speed
(the speed which minicom uses to communicate with your
modem) or the line speed (the speed that your modem uses
<br>
on the line to communicate with the other modem). Notice
that the line speed may change during the connection, but
you will still only see the initial speed that the <br>
modems started the connection with. This is because the
modem doesn&rsquo;t tell the program if the speed is
changed. Also, to see the line speed, you need to have the
modem set <br>
to show it in the connect string. Otherwise you will only
see 0 as the line speed. <br>
T - Multi-line untag <br>
You can toggle the feature to untag entries from the dialing
directory when a connection is established to a multi-line
BBS. All the tagged entries that have the same name <br>
are untagged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that a special exception is
made for this menu: every user can change all parameters
here, but some of them will not be saved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Screen and keyboard <br>
A - Command key is <br>
the &rsquo;Hot Key&rsquo; that brings you into command mode.
If this is set to &rsquo;ALT&rsquo; or &rsquo;meta
key&rsquo;, you can directly call commands by alt-key
instead of HotKey-key. <br>
B - Backspace key sends <br>
There still are some systems that want a VT100 to send DEL
instead of BS. With this option you can enable that
stupidity. (Eh, it&rsquo;s even on by default...) <br>
C - Status line is <br>
Enabled or disabled. Some slow terminals (for example,
X-terminals) cause the status line to jump &quot;up and
down&quot; when scrolling, so you can turn it off if
desired. It will <br>
still be shown in command-mode. <br>
D - Alarm sound <br>
If turned on, minicom will sound an alarm (on the console
only) after a successful connection and when up/downloading
is complete. <br>
E - Foreground Color (menu) <br>
indicates the foreground color to use for all the
configuration windows in minicom. <br>
F - Background Color (menu) <br>
indicates the background color to use for all the
configuration windows in minicom. Note that minicom will not
allow you to set foreground and background colors to the
<br>
same value. <br>
G - Foreground Color (term) <br>
indicates the foreground color to use in the terminal
window. <br>
H - Background Color (term) <br>
indicates the background color to use in the terminal
window. Note that minicom will not allow you to set
foreground and background colors to the same value. <br>
I - Foreground Color (stat) <br>
indicates the foreground color to use in for the status bar.
<br>
J - Background Color (stat) <br>
indicates the color to use in for the status bar. Note that
minicom will allow you to set the status bar&rsquo;s
foreground and background colors to the same value. This
will <br>
effectively make the status bar invisible but if these are
your intentions, please see the option <br>
K - History buffer size <br>
The number of lines to keep in the history buffer (for
backscrolling). <br>
L - Macros file <br>
is the full path to the file that holds macros. Macros allow
you to define a string to be sent when you press a certain
key. In minicom, you may define F1 through F10 to <br>
send up to 256 characters [this is set at compile time]. The
filename you specify is verified as soon as you hit ENTER.
If you do not have permissions to create the speci&acirc;
<br>
fied file, an error message will so indicate and you will be
forced to re-edit the filename. If you are permitted to
create the file, minicom checks to see if it already <br>
exists. If so, it assumes it&rsquo;s a macro file and reads
it in. If it isn&rsquo;t, well, it&rsquo;s your problem :-)
If the file does not exist, the filename is accepted. <br>
M - Edit Macros <br>
opens up a new window which allows you to edit the F1
through F10 macros. <br>
N - Macros enabled <br>
- Yes or No. If macros are disabled, the F1-F10 keys will
just send the VT100/VT220 function key escape sequences.
<br>
O - Character conversion <br>
The active conversion table filename is shown here. If you
can see no name, no conversion is active. Pressing O, you
will see the conversion table edit menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Edit Macros <br>
Here, the macros for F1 through F10 are defined. The bottom
of the window shows a legend of character combinations that
have special meaning. They allow you to enter <br>
special control characters with plain text by prefixing them
with a &rsquo;^&rsquo;, in which &rsquo;^^&rsquo; means
&rsquo;^&rsquo; itself. You can send a 1 second delay with
the &rsquo;^~&rsquo; code. This is use&acirc; <br>
ful when you are trying to login after ftp&rsquo;ing or
telnet&rsquo;ing somewhere. You can also include your
current username and password from the phone directory in
the macros <br>
with &rsquo;&rsquo; and &rsquo;&rsquo;, respectively. If you
need the backslash character in the macro, write it doubled
as &rsquo;\&rsquo;. To edit a macro, press the number (or
letter for F10) and <br>
you will be moved to the end of the macro. When editing the
line, you may use the left &amp; right arrows, Home &amp;
End keys, Delete &amp; BackSpace, and ESC and RETURN. ESC
<br>
cancels any changes made while ENTER accepts the
changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Character conversion <br>
Here you can edit the character conversion table. If you are
not an American, you know that in many languages there are
characters that are not included in the ASCII <br>
character set, and in the old times they may have replaced
some less important characters in ASCII and now they are
often represented with character codes above 127. <br>
AND there are various different ways to represent them. This
is where you may edit conversion tables for systems that use
a character set different from the one on your <br>
computer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A - Load table <br>
You probably guessed it. This command loads a table from the
disk. You are asked a file name for the table. Predefined
tables .mciso, .mcpc8 and .mcsf7 should be <br>
included with the program. Table .mciso does no conversion,
.mcpc8 is to be used for connections with systems that use
the 8-bit pc character set, and .mcsf7 is for <br>
compatibility with the systems that uses the good old 7-bit
coding to replace the characters {|}[]&nbsp;with the
diacritical characters used in Finnish and Swedish.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">B - Save table <br>
This one saves the active table on the filename you
specify.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C - edit char <br>
This is where you can make your own modifications to the
existing table. First you are asked the character value (in
decimal) whose conversion you want to change. <br>
Next you&rsquo;ll say which character you want to see on
your screen when that character comes from the outside
world. And then you&rsquo;ll be asked what you want to be
sent out <br>
when you enter that character from your keyboard.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">D - next screen</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">E - prev screen <br>
Yeah, you probably noticed that this screen shows you what
kind of conversions are active. The screen just is (usually)
too small to show the whole table at once in <br>
an easy-to-understand format. This is how you can scroll the
table left and right.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">F - convert capture <br>
Toggles whether or not the character conversion table is
used when writing the capture file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Save setup as dfl <br>
Save the parameters as the default for the next time the
program is started. Instead of dfl, any other parameter name
may appear, depending on which one was used when the
pro&acirc; <br>
gram was started.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Save setup as.. <br>
Save the parameters under a special name. Whenever Minicom
is started with this name as an argument, it will use these
parameters. This option is of course privileged to root.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Exit <br>
Escape from this menu without saving. This can also be done
with ESC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Exit from minicom <br>
Only root will see this menu entry, if he/she started
minicom with the &rsquo;-s&rsquo; option. This way, it is
possible to change the configuration without actually
running minicom.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STATUS LINE <br>
The status line has several indicators, that speak for
themselves. The mysterious APP or NOR indicator probably
needs explanation. The VT100 cursor keys can be in two
modes: <br>
applications mode and cursor mode. This is controlled by an
escape sequence. If you find that the cursor keys do not
work in, say, vi when you&rsquo;re logged in using minicom
then you <br>
can see with this indicator whether the cursor keys are in
applications or cursor mode. You can toggle the two with the
C-A I key. If the cursor keys then work, it&rsquo;s probably
an <br>
error in the remote system&rsquo;s termcap initialization
strings (is).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LOCALES <br>
Minicom has support for local languages. This means you can
change most of the English messages and other strings to
another language by setting the environment variable
LANG.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MISC <br>
If minicom is hung, kill it with SIGTERM . (This means kill
-15, or since sigterm is default, just plain &quot;kill
&lt;minicompid&gt;&quot;. This will cause a graceful exit of
minicom, doing <br>
resets and everything. You may kill minicom from a script
with the command &quot;! killall -9 minicom&quot; without
hanging up the line. Without the -9 parameter, minicom first
hangs up <br>
before exiting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since a lot of escape sequences
begin with ESC (Arrow up is ESC [ A), Minicom does not know
if the escape character it gets is you pressing the escape
key, or part of a sequence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An old version of Minicom, V1.2,
solved this in a rather crude way: to get the escape key,
you had to press it twice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As of release 1.3 this has
bettered a little: now a 1-second timeout is builtin, like
in vi. For systems that have the select() system call the
timeout is 0.5 seconds. And... <br>
surprise: a special Linux-dependent hack :-) was added. Now,
minicom can separate the escape key and escape-sequences. To
see how dirty this was done, look into wkeys.c. But it <br>
works like a charm!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
Minicom keeps it&rsquo;s configuration files in one
directory, usually /var/lib/minicom, /usr/local/etc or /etc.
To find out what default directory minicom has compiled in,
issue the <br>
command minicom -h. You&rsquo;ll probably also find the demo
files for runscript(1), and the examples of character
conversion tables either there or in the subdirectories of
<br>
/usr/doc/minicom*. The conversion tables are named something
like mc.* in that directory, but you probably want to copy
the ones you need in your home directory as something <br>
beginning with a dot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">minirc.* <br>
$HOME/.minirc.* <br>
$HOME/.dialdir <br>
$HOME/minicom.log <br>
