<p>LZMA(1) General Commands Manual LZMA(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
lzma, unlzma, lzcat - LZMA compression and decompression
tool</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
lzma [-123456789cdefhkLqtvV] [-S suffix] [filenames ...]
<br>
unlzma [-cfhkLqtvV] [-S suffix] [filenames ...] <br>
lzcat [-fhLqV] [filenames ...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
LZMA (Lempel-Ziv-Markov chain-Algorithm) is an improved
version of famous LZ77 compression algorithm. It was
improved in way of maximum increasing of compression ratio,
keeping <br>
high decompression speed and low memory requirements for
decompressing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lzma command line tool has a
similar interface to gzip(1) and bzip2(1) and is intended to
make use of LZMA compression easy for the users who are
already familiar with gzip and <br>
bzip2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In this manual lzma is compared
mostly to bzip2 because that is currently one of the most
widely used free software to compress tar files made for
distribution. Comparing lzma <br>
to gzip is not practical because neither lzma nor bzip2 can
compete with gzip in compression speed. On the other hand
the compression ratio of gzip is worse than of lzma and <br>
bzip2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lzma provides notably better
compression ratio than bzip2 especially with files having
other than plain text content. The other advantage of lzma
is fast decompression which is <br>
many times quicker than bzip2. The major disadvantage is
that achieving the highest compression ratios requires
extensive amount of system resources, both CPU time and RAM.
Also <br>
software to handle LZMA compressed files is not installed by
default on most distributions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When compressing or
decompressing with lzma, the new file will have the same
ownership information, permissions and timestamps as the
original file. However the this information <br>
is not stored into the compressed file like gzip does.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STREAMED VS. NON-STREAMED <br>
LZMA files can be either streamed or non-streamed.
Non-streamed files are created only when the size of the
file being compressed is known. In practice this means that
the source <br>
file must be a regular file. In other words, if compressing
from the standard input or from a named pipe (fifo) the
compressed file will always be streamed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Both streamed and non-streamed
files are compressed identically; the only differences are
found from the beginnings and ends of LZMA compressed files:
Non-streamed files contain <br>
the uncompressed size of the file in the LZMA file header;
streamed files have uncompressed size marked as unknown. To
know where to stop decoding, streamed files have a special
<br>
End Of Stream marker at the end of the LZMA file. The EOS
marker makes streamed files five or six bytes bigger than
non-streamed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">So in practice creating
non-streamed files has two advantages: 1) the compressed
file is a few bytes smaller and 2) the uncompressed size of
the file can be checked without <br>
decompressing the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Short options can be grouped like -cd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c --stdout --to-stdout <br>
The output is written to the standard output. The original
files are kept unchanged. When compressing to the standard
output there can be only one input file. This option <br>
is implied when input is read from the standard input or the
script is invoked as lzcat.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d --decompress --uncompress
<br>
Force decompression regardless of the invocation name. This
the default when called as unlzma or lzcat.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f --force <br>
Force compression or decompression even if source file is a
symlink, target exists, or target is a terminal. In contrast
to gzip and bzip2, if input data is not in LZMA <br>
format, --force does not make lzma behave like cat. lzma
never prompts if target file should be overwritten; existing
files are skipped or, in case of --force, overwrit&acirc;
<br>
ten.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h --help <br>
Show a summary of supported options and quit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k --keep <br>
Do not delete the input files after compression or
decompression.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L --license <br>
Show licensing information of lzma.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q --quiet <br>
Suppress all warnings. You can still check the exit status
to detect if a warning had been shown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S --suffix .suf <br>
Use .suf instead of the default .lzma. A null suffix forces
unlzma to decompress all the given files regardless of the
filename suffix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t --test <br>
Check the integrity of the compressed file(s). Without
--verbose no output is produced if no errors are found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v --verbose <br>
Show the filename and percentage reduction of each processes
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V --version <br>
Show the version number of lzma.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z --compress <br>
Force compression regardless of the invocation name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-1 .. -9 <br>
Set the compression ratio. These options have no effect when
decompressing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--fast Alias to -1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--best Alias to -9.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
Exit status: <br>
0 - Everything OK. <br>
1 - An error occurred. <br>
2 - Something worth a warning happened but no errors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It can be especially useful with
tar(1) patched to support LZMA compression.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHORS <br>
The LZMA algorithm and the implementation used in LZMA utils
was developed by Igor Pavlov. The original code is available
in LZMA SDK which can be found from <br>
http://7-zip.org/sdk.html .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lzma command line tool was
written by Ville Koskinen. http://tukaani.org/lzma/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This manual page is inspired by
manual pages of gzip and bzip2.</p>
