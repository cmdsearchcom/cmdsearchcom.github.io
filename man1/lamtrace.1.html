<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
The -t option of mpirun(1) and loadgo(1) allows the application to generate
  execution traces. These traces are first stored in a buffer within each
  application process. When the buffer is full and when the application
  terminates, the runtime buffer is flushed to the trace daemon (a structural
  component within the LAM daemon). The trace daemon will also collect data up
  to a pre-compiled limit. Beyond this limit, the oldest traces in will be
  forgotten in favor of the newer traces.
<div class="Pp"></div>
After an application has finished, the record of its execution is stored in the
  trace daemons of each node that was running the application. The
  <i>lamtrace</i> command can be used to retrieve these traces and store them in
  one file for display by a performance visualization tool, such as xmpi(1). If
  the application was started by xmpi(1), <i>lamtrace</i> is not normally needed
  as the equivalent functionality is invoked with a button.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Incomplete trace data can be unloaded while the application is running. The
  output file must not exist prior to invoking <i>lamtrace</i>. This is a good
  situation to use the -k option, which preserves the trace daemon's contents
  after unloading. Each reload will then get the entire run's trace data up to
  the present time.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A running process is likely to be holding the most recent trace data in an
  internal buffer. A standard LAM signal, LAM_SIGTRACE (see doom(1)), causes
  trace enabled processes to flush the internal trace buffer to the daemon. The
  -f option tells <i>lamtrace</i> to send this signal to all target processes
  before unloading trace data. A race condition develops between the target
  process storing trace data to the daemon and the unloading procedure. The
  problem is foisted upon the user who gives a delay parameter after -f.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Trace data are organized by node, process identifier and list number. A process
  can store traces on any node, although the local node is the obvious, least
  intrusive choice. The process can identify itself in any meaningful way
  (getpid(2) is a good idea) The list number is also chosen by the process.
  These values may be set by an instrumented library, such as libmpi(3), or
  directly by the application with lam_rtrstore(2). Unloading flexibility
  follows that of storing with the -l option selecting the list number, and
  standard LAM command line mnemonics selecting nodes and processes.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Dropping old traces when a pre-compiled volume limit is reached only happens for
  positive list numbers. Traces in negatively numbered lists will be collected
  until the underlying system runs out of memory. Do not use negative list
  numbers for high volume trace data.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If no process selection is given on the command line, trace data will be
  unloaded for all processes on each specified node.
<div class="Pp"></div>
LAM, its trace daemon and <i>lamtrace</i> are all unaware of the format and
  meaning of traces.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The -R option does not unload trace data. It causes the target trace daemons to
  free the memory occupied by trace data in the given list. If all lists are
  specified (no -l option), the trace daemon is effectively reset to its state
  after initiating LAM.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Unloading_MPI_Trace_Data"><a class="selflink" href="#Unloading_MPI_Trace_Data">Unloading
  MPI Trace Data</a></h2>
A special capability, selected by the -mpi option, exists to search for and
  unload only the trace data generated by an MPI application. For this purpose,
  <i>lamtrace</i> is aware of the particular reserved list numbers that
  libmpi(3) uses to store traces. It begins by searching all specified nodes and
  processes (the whole LAM multicomputer, if nothing is specified) for a special
  trace generated by process rank 0 in MPI_COMM_WORLD of an MPI application.
  This special trace contains the node and process identifiers of all processes
  in that MPI_COMM_WORLD communicator. <i>lamtrace</i> then uses the node /
  process information to collect all trace data generated by libmpi(3).
<div class="Pp"></div>
If multiple world communicators exist within LAM's trace daemons, the first one
  found is used. Multiple worlds may be present due to multiple concurrent
  applications, trace data from a previous run not removed (either with
  <i>lamtrace</i> or lamclean(1)), or an application that spawns processes. A
  particular world communicator can be located by providing precise node and
  process location to <i>lamtrace</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The -mpi option is not compatible with the -l option.

Since trace data can be unloaded during an application's execution, there should
  be a way to incrementally append to an output file. This is a bit tricky with
  -mpi, but it can be done.
