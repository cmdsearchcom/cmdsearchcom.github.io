<p>LAMTRACE(1) LAM COMMANDS LAMTRACE(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
lamtrace - Unload LAM trace data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
lamtrace [-hkvR] [-mpi] [-l listno] [-f #secs] [filename]
[nodes] [processes]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-h Print useful information on this command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k Copy and do not remove trace
data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Be verbose.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R Delete all trace data from
the specified nodes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l Unload only from the given
list number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mpi Unload trace data for an
MPI application.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f #secs Signal target processes
to flush trace data to the daemon. Then wait #secs before
unloading.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">filename Place trace data into
this file (default: def.lamtr).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The -t option of mpirun(1) and loadgo(1) allows the
application to generate execution traces. These traces are
first stored in a buffer within each application process.
When <br>
the buffer is full and when the application terminates, the
runtime buffer is flushed to the trace daemon (a structural
component within the LAM daemon). The trace daemon will <br>
also collect data up to a pre-compiled limit. Beyond this
limit, the oldest traces in will be forgotten in favor of
the newer traces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After an application has
finished, the record of its execution is stored in the trace
daemons of each node that was running the application. The
lamtrace command can be used to <br>
retrieve these traces and store them in one file for display
by a performance visualization tool, such as xmpi(1). If the
application was started by xmpi(1), lamtrace is not <br>
normally needed as the equivalent functionality is invoked
with a button.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Incomplete trace data can be
unloaded while the application is running. The output file
must not exist prior to invoking lamtrace. This is a good
situation to use the -k op&acirc; <br>
tion, which preserves the trace daemon&rsquo;s contents
after unloading. Each reload will then get the entire
run&rsquo;s trace data up to the present time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A running process is likely to
be holding the most recent trace data in an internal buffer.
A standard LAM signal, LAM_SIGTRACE (see doom(1)), causes
trace enabled processes to <br>
flush the internal trace buffer to the daemon. The -f option
tells lamtrace to send this signal to all target processes
before unloading trace data. A race condition develops <br>
between the target process storing trace data to the daemon
and the unloading procedure. The problem is foisted upon the
user who gives a delay parameter after -f.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Trace data are organized by
node, process identifier and list number. A process can
store traces on any node, although the local node is the
obvious, least intrusive choice. <br>
The process can identify itself in any meaningful way
(getpid(2) is a good idea) The list number is also chosen by
the process. These values may be set by an instrumented
li&acirc; <br>
brary, such as libmpi(3), or directly by the application
with lam_rtrstore(2). Unloading flexibility follows that of
storing with the -l option selecting the list number, and
<br>
standard LAM command line mnemonics selecting nodes and
processes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Dropping old traces when a
pre-compiled volume limit is reached only happens for
positive list numbers. Traces in negatively numbered lists
will be collected until the underly&acirc; <br>
ing system runs out of memory. Do not use negative list
numbers for high volume trace data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no process selection is given
on the command line, trace data will be unloaded for all
processes on each specified node.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LAM, its trace daemon and
lamtrace are all unaware of the format and meaning of
traces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -R option does not unload
trace data. It causes the target trace daemons to free the
memory occupied by trace data in the given list. If all
lists are specified (no -l op&acirc; <br>
tion), the trace daemon is effectively reset to its state
after initiating LAM.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unloading MPI Trace Data <br>
A special capability, selected by the -mpi option, exists to
search for and unload only the trace data generated by an
MPI application. For this purpose, lamtrace is aware of <br>
the particular reserved list numbers that libmpi(3) uses to
store traces. It begins by searching all specified nodes and
processes (the whole LAM multicomputer, if nothing is <br>
specified) for a special trace generated by process rank 0
in MPI_COMM_WORLD of an MPI application. This special trace
contains the node and process identifiers of all processes
<br>
in that MPI_COMM_WORLD communicator. lamtrace then uses the
node / process information to collect all trace data
generated by libmpi(3).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If multiple world communicators
exist within LAM&rsquo;s trace daemons, the first one found
is used. Multiple worlds may be present due to multiple
concurrent applications, trace data <br>
from a previous run not removed (either with lamtrace or
lamclean(1)), or an application that spawns processes. A
particular world communicator can be located by providing
pre&acirc; <br>
cise node and process location to lamtrace.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -mpi option is not
compatible with the -l option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
lamtrace -v -mpi mytraces <br>
Unload trace data into the file &quot;mytraces&quot; from
the first MPI application found in a search of the entire
LAM multicomputer. Report on important steps as they are
done.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lamtrace n30 -l 5 p21367 <br>
Unload trace data from list 5 of process ID 21367 on node
30. Operate silently.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lamtrace -mpi n30 p21367 <br>
Unload trace data from the MPI application world group whose
process rank 0 has PID 21367 and is/was running on node
30.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Since trace data can be unloaded during an
application&rsquo;s execution, there should be a way to
incrementally append to an output file. This is a bit tricky
with -mpi, but it can <br>
be done.</p>
