<p>gtk3-nocsd(1) General Commands Manual gtk3-nocsd(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
gtk3-nocsd - transparently disable Gtk+3 client side
decorations (CSD)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
gtk3-nocsd command [ command arguments ... ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">symlinked-command <br>
[ command arguments ... ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
gtk3-nocsd runs a command in the environment where Gtk+3
client side decorations (CSD) are disabled, by using
LD_PRELOAD to load the library libgtk3-nocsd.so.0 that
overrides <br>
some GLib, GDK and Gtk API calls with customized
variants.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
command <br>
The command to execute. It may be either a full path or the
name of the command in PATH. In case command cannot be found
in PATH, gtk3-nocsd will fail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">command arguments <br>
Arbitrary number of arguments to pass to the command being
executed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INTEGRATION IN DEBIAN <br>
Usage of gtk3-nocsd is not required in Debian by default,
because gtk3-nocsd functionality is activated automatically
on Xsession startup if anything but GNOME is used. On GNOME
<br>
CSDs will remain enabled. Both the administrator and each
individual user may override those defaults.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Administrators may choose to
re-enable CSDs by default by editing the file
/etc/X11/Xsession.d/01gtk3-nocsd and changing the following
setting:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">export GTK_CSD=1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Users may choose to override
this (in either way) by adding a similar line to their
~/.xsessionrc. For more details, please see
/usr/share/doc/gtk3-nocsd/README.Debian.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USAGE VIA SYMLINKS <br>
If a symlink to gtk3-nocsd under a different name is called,
gtk3-nocsd will assume that the name it was called under is
the name of the command that is supposed to be executed.
<br>
It will look for the command in the PATH environment
variable, excluding itself, and execute it with the proper
environment variables set. This is useful when is not
desirable to <br>
add gtk3-nocsd to the system-wide LD_PRELOAD or if it should
be applied only to certain applications.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CAVEATS <br>
When using gtk3-nocsd with setarch (including alias such as
linux32), or anyway with chroots with different
architectures than the host&rsquo;s, make sure to install
the matching <br>
architecture version of libgtk3-nocsd.so.0 both in the
setarch environment and the host&rsquo;s environment. Note
that the gtk3-nocsd binary must then be installed in a
system path <br>
(/usr/bin, /usr/local/bin, ...), so that it will set
LD_PRELOAD to just the library name and let the dynamic
linker find it automatically - allowing the dynamic linker
to pick <br>
the version for the correct architecture. If gtk3-nocsd is
not installed in a system path, it will use a full path,
allowing only for a single version of the library to be
used.</p>
