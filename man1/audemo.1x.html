<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
audemo - Network Audio System record and play demo</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
audemo [-audio servername] [-toolkitoption ...]
[directory]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
audemo provides an X-based window-oriented user interface to
the Network Audio System service. It allows the user to play
pre-recorded sound files, record new sound files and to <br>
manipulate Network Audio System buckets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUDEMO AND THE ATHENA WIDGET SET
<br>
audemo uses the X Toolkit Intrinsics and the Athena Widget
Set. For more information, see the Athena Widget Set
documentation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SCREEN LAYOUT <br>
audemo starts out with a single window divided into several
areas:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o A collection of command
buttons.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o A left and right level
meter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o A volume indicator and control
slider.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o An information window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o An editable field containing
the directory to be searched for sound files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o An editable field containing a
list of sound files to search for.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o A window containing the list
of sound files that may be selected for playing or loading
into buckets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PLAYING A SOUND FILE <br>
To play a sound file you must first select it from the list
of files in the file window. You can control which files are
listed in this window by editing the Directory and/or <br>
Template fields and clicking on the Rescan button. To select
a file, single-click on the filename. This will highlight
the filename and display information about the file in <br>
the information window. The information displayed
includes:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Filename <br>
The full pathname of the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File Format <br>
The file format of the audio file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Data Format <br>
The encoding format of the audio data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tracks <br>
The number of tracks of audio data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Frequency <br>
The frequency at which the audio data was sampled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Duration <br>
The duration of the audio data in seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Text <br>
Any text information stored in the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once the file has been selected,
you can start it playing by clicking on the Play command
button. A shortcut for playing a file is to double-click on
the file name. This will <br>
select the file and start it playing. When a file is
playing, the Play command button is highlighted. To stop the
playing of a file, click on the highlighted Play button. To
<br>
enable the left and right level meters, click on the Meter
button before starting to play the file. To disable the left
and right level meters, click again on the highlighted <br>
Meter button. To adjust the volume level, use the volume
slider.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RECORDING TO A FILE <br>
audemo can record sound files in any supported file and data
format. To record a sound file you must first bring up the
record window by clicking on the Record command button. <br>
This will bring up a window containing the following fields
and controls:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Filename <br>
The name of the file you wish to create. Unless a path is
specified here, the file will be created in the current
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File Format <br>
A menu of file formats.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Data Format <br>
A menu of data formats. Note that each file format does not
necessarily support all of the data formats listed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Max Duration <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Read Only <br>
See RECORDING TO A BUCKET.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Frequency <br>
The sampling rate (in hertz) for the recording. Higher
sampling rates yield better quality sound but take up more
disk and memory space. Common sampling rates are 8000 <br>
(good for voice annotations), 11000, 22000, and 44000.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mic(rophone) <br>
This button tells the audio server if you&rsquo;ve got a
microphone attached to the audio input jack. Clicking this
button will highlight it and cause the audio server to boost
<br>
the input gain to a level suitable for recording with a
microphone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Comment <br>
Text (such as a description) you wish to put into the audio
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Gain <br>
This slider is used to adjust the recording gain level.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Record <br>
This button starts or stops the recording.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Monitor <br>
This button enables or disables monitoring.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">New Bucket <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Dismiss <br>
This button stops recording and monitoring and closes the
record window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once you have selected the
filename, file and data formats, frequency, mic level,
comment and gain, you are ready to record. To listen in on
the audio that will be recorded you <br>
can click on the Monitor button. This will direct all the
audio received from the audio input jack to be played on the
speaker. When you&rsquo;re ready to record, click on the
Record <br>
button. All the audio received from the audio input jack
will now be recorded into the file. The recording will
continue until you click on the Record button again or click
on <br>
the Dismiss button. NOTE: Audio data can accumulate very
rapidly, especially at high sampling rates, resulting in
large files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUCKETS <br>
The Network Audio System service provides the capability to
create server resident sound objects called buckets. audemo
allows the user to create buckets, record into them, play
<br>
from them, load them with data from a file and dump their
contents into a file. Note that buckets created by audemo
are destroyed when audemo is terminated. These options are
<br>
available when you bring up the buckets window by clicking
on the Buckets button in the main window. The buckets
windows is divided into two areas:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o A collection of command
buttons.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o A table of buckets currently
accessible. This table contains the following columns:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Description <br>
The text description.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Duration <br>
The duration of the audio data in seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tracks <br>
The number of tracks of audio data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Frequency <br>
The frequency at which the audio data was sampled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Format <br>
A code letter indicating the encoding format of the audio
data. A key to the format code letters can be displayed by
clicking on the Format Key button.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Access <br>
A combination of code letters indicating the access mode of
the bucket. A key to the access code letters can be
displayed by clicking on the Access Key button.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CREATING A BUCKET FROM A FILE
<br>
To create a bucket from from an audio data file, select the
filename from the list of files in the file window then
click the Load button in the buckets window. The first line
<br>
of the buckets table should now contain the information
about the newly created bucket.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PLAYING FROM A BUCKET <br>
To play a bucket, select the bucket you wish to play by
clicking on it&rsquo;s information in the buckets table. The
entry you click on should be highlighted. Then click on the
Play <br>
button in the buckets window. A shortcut for playing from a
bucket is to double-click on the bucket information. This
will select the bucket and start playing from it. To stop
<br>
the playing of a bucket, click on the highlighted Play
button in the buckets window. The level meters and volume
level can be controlled in the same way as when playing from
a <br>
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RECORDING TO A BUCKET <br>
To record into a new bucket, click on the Record button in
the buckets window. This will bring up the record window.
This record window is the same as the one used for
record&acirc; <br>
ing to files. Instead of specifying a filename, in the Max
Duration field, enter the maximum duration (in seconds) of
data that the bucket is to hold. Clicking on the Read Only
<br>
button will prevent other applications from writing into or
destroying the bucket. The frequency, mic level, format and
comment are used in the same way as when recording to <br>
files. Once all of the fields are set appropriately, click
the New Buckett button. This will create a new bucket
according to the specifications given. The first line of the
<br>
buckets table should now contain the information about the
newly created bucket. To begin recording into the bucket,
select the bucket by clicking on it&rsquo;s information in
the <br>
buckets table. Then click the Record button in the record
window. All the audio received from the audio input jack
will now be recorded into the bucket. The recording will
<br>
continue until you click on the Record button again, click
on the Dismiss or the bucket is filled. The Gain slider and
the Monitor button operate the same as when recording to a
<br>
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SAVING A BUCKET TO A FILE <br>
To save a bucket to a file, first select the bucket by
clicking on its information in the buckets table. Then click
on the Save button in the buckets window. A dialog box will
<br>
pop up prompting you for the name of the file in which to
save the bucket data, and the file format. The data format
used will be that of the bucket. Note that each file format
<br>
may only support selected data formats. If no path is given
in the filename, the file will be created in the current
directory. Clicking on Ok or pressing the RETURN key will
<br>
cause the file to be created and the data from the bucket to
be written to the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DELETING A BUCKET <br>
To delete a bucket, first select the bucket by clicking on
it&rsquo;s information in the buckets table. Then click on
the Delete button in the buckets window. If the audemo has
the <br>
appropriate access permissions for the bucket, the bucket
will be deleted and it&rsquo;s information will be removed
from the bucket table.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXITING AUDEMO <br>
Clicking on the Quit button will cause audemo to exit,
stopping any playing or recording operations and destroying
any buckets that were created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMAND LINE OPTIONS <br>
-audio servername <br>
This option specifies the Network Audio System server to
which audemo should connect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">directory <br>
The directory name that audemo will use to build the list of
selectable file names. When directory is not specified on
the command line, the current working directory is <br>
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
In the following example, in a TCP/IP network, mcxterm is
the name of the desktop machine running the audio server.
The default port is 8000 and sound files are located in <br>
~/snd:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">audemo -audio tcp/mcxterm:8000
~/snd</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the following example, the
shortened form of the audio server name is used and sound
files from the current working directory will be used:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">audemo -audio mcxterm:0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
In addition to the standard toolkit environment variables,
the following environment variables are used by audemo:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUDIOSERVER <br>
This variable specifies the default audio server to contact
if -audio is not specified on the command line. If this
variable is not set and the -audio is not specified <br>
on the command line, audemo will attempt to connect to the
audio server running on the X Window System display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Warning: audemo is the xterm of the Network Audio System. It
was written to test features as the Network Audio System was
being developed. It was also the author&rsquo;s first Xt
<br>
program. Consequently, it&rsquo;s pretty ugly and should be
completely re-written from scratch.</p>
