<p style="margin-top: 1em">VERSION <br>
2.3.5 August 13, 2001</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This manual page documents briefly the Linklint program,
which is an Open Source Perl program that checks local and
remote HTML links.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This manual page was written for
the Debian distribution because the original program does
not have a manual page. Instead, it has documentation in the
HTML format; see below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Input File Selection <br>
Whether you are doing a local site check or an HTTP site
check, you specify which directories (presumably containing
HTML files) to check with one or more linksets. A linkset
<br>
uses two wildcard characters @ and #. Each linkset specifies
one or more directories much like the standard * and ?
wildcard characters are used to specify the characters in
the <br>
* names of files in one directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The @ character matches any
string of characters (this kind of acts like &quot;*&quot;),
and the # character (which is kind of like &quot;?&quot;)
matches any string of characters except &quot;/&quot; . The
<br>
best way to understand how @ and # work is to look at a few
examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">the entire site /@ <br>
the homepage only (default) / <br>
files in the root directory only /# <br>
. . . and one directory down /#/# <br>
files in the sub directory only /sub/# <br>
files in the sub directory and below /sub/@ <br>
specific files /file1 /file2 ... <br>
specific subdirectories /sub1/@ /sub2/@ ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you specify more than one
linkset, files matching any of the linksets will be checked.
HTML files that don&rsquo;t match any of the linksets will
be skipped. Linklint will see if <br>
they exist but won&rsquo;t check any of their links.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other File Selection Options
<br>
-skip skipset <br>
Skips HTML files that match skipset. &quot;Linklint&quot;
will make sure these files exist but won&rsquo;t add any of
their links to the list of files to check. Multiple skipsets
are <br>
allowed, but each must be preceded with -skip on the command
line. Skipsets use the same wildcard characters as
linksets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ignore ignoreset <br>
Ignores files matching ignoreset. &quot;Linklint&quot;
doesn&rsquo;t even check to see if these files exist.
Multiple ignoresets are allowed, but each must be preceded
with -ignore on the <br>
command line. Ignoresets use the same wildcard characters as
linksets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-limit n <br>
Limits checking to n HTML files (default 500). All HTML
files after the first n are skipped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Local Site Checking <br>
If you are developing HTML pages on a computer that does not
have an http server, or if you are developing a simple site
that does not use Server Redirection or extensive CGI, <br>
you should use local site checking.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">linklint /@</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Checks all HTML files in the
current directory and below. Assumes that the current
directory is the server root directory so links starting
with &quot;/&quot; default to this directory. <br>
You must specify /@ to check the entire site. See Which
Files to Check for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">linklint -root dir /@</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Checks all HTML files in dir and
below. This is useful if you want to check several sites on
the same machine or if you don&rsquo;t want to run Linklint
in your public HTML directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other Local Site Options <br>
-host hostname <br>
By default &quot;Linklint&quot; assumes all links on your
site that start with &quot;http://&quot; are remote links to
other sites. If you have absolute links to your own site,
give &quot;Linklint&quot; <br>
your hostname and links starting with
&quot;http://hostname&quot; will be treated as local files.
If you specify -host hostname:port, only http links to this
hostname and port will be <br>
treated as local files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-case <br>
Makes sure that the filename (upper/lower) case used links
inside of html tags matches the case used by the file
system. This is for Windows only and is very handy if you
<br>
are porting a site to a Unix host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-orphan <br>
Checks all directories that contain files used on the site
for unused (orphan) files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-index file <br>
Uses file as the default index file instead of the default
list used by &quot;Linklint&quot;. You can specify more than
one file but each one must be preceded by -index on the
command <br>
line. If a default index file is not found,
&quot;Linklint&quot; uses a listing of the entire directory.
See the Default File section for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-map /a=[/b] <br>
Substitutes leading /a with /b. For server-side image maps
or to simulate Server Redirection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-no_warn_index <br>
Turns of the &quot;index file not found&quot; warning.
Applies to local site checking only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-no_anchors <br>
Tells &quot;Linklint&quot; to ignore named anchors. This
could ease memory problems for people with large sites who
are primarily interested in missing pages and not missing
named <br>
anchors. This option works for both HTTP and local site
checks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HTTP Site Checking <br>
If you have a complicated site that uses lots of CGI or
Server Redirection, you should use HTTP site checking. Even
though an HTTP site check reads pages via your HTTP server,
<br>
you will get the best performance if you do your checking on
a machine that has a high speed connection to your
server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">linklint -http -host
www.site.com /@</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -http flag tells
&quot;Linklint&quot; to check HTML files on the site
www.site.com via a remote http connection. You must specify
a -host whenever you do an HTTP site check (otherwise <br>
Linklint won&rsquo;t where to get your pages). You can
specify /@ to check the entire site. See Which Files to
Check for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HTTP Site Check Options <br>
-http <br>
This flag tells Linklint to perform an HTTP site check
instead of a local site check. All files (except server side
image maps) will be read via the HTTP protocol from your
<br>
web server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-host hostname:port <br>
If you include :port at the end of your hostname, Linklint
uses this port for the HTTP site check.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-password realm user:password
<br>
Uses user and password as authorization to enter password
protected realm. Realms are named areas of a site that share
a common set of usernames and passwords. If passwords <br>
are needed to check your site, Linklint will tell you which
realms need passwords in warning messages. Enclose the realm
in double quotes if it contains spaces. If no <br>
password is given for a specific realm, Linklint will try
using the password for the &quot;&quot;DEFAULT&quot;&quot;
realm if it was provided.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-timeout t <br>
Times out after t seconds (default 15) when getting files
via http. Once data is received, an additional t seconds is
allowed. The timeout is disabled on Windows machines <br>
since the Windows port of Perl does not support the
&quot;alarm()&quot; function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-delay d <br>
Delays d seconds between requests to the same host (default
0). This is a friendly thing to do especially if you are
checking many links on the same host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-local linkset <br>
Gets files that match linkset locally. The default -local
linkset is @.map (which matches any link ending in .map).
This allows Linklint to follow links through server-side
<br>
image maps. The default is ignored if you specify your own
-local expressions. You need to specify the -root directory
for this option to work propery.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-map /a=[/b] <br>
Substitutes leading /a with /b. For server-side image maps
or to simulate Server Redirection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-no_anchors <br>
Tells &quot;Linklint&quot; to ignore named anchors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-no_query_string <br>
Up until version 2.3.4, Linklint did not use query strings
while doing HTTP site checks. Query strings were removed
before making HTTP requests. As of 2.3.4 query strings <br>
in links are used in the requests. Use the -no_query_string
flag to get back the &quot;old&quot; behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-http_header Name:value <br>
Adds the HTTP header Name: value to all HTTP requests
generated by Linklint. You will need to use quotation marks
to hide spaces in the header line from the command line <br>
interpreter. Linklint will automatically add a space after
the first colon if there is not one there already. Multiple
(unique) header lines are allowed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-language zz <br>
This option is only useful if you are checking a site that
uses content negotiation to present the same URL in
different languages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Creates an HTTP Request header
of the form Accept-Language: zz that is included as part of
all HTTP requests generated by Linklint. Multiple -language
specifications are <br>
allowed. This will result in a single Accept-Language:
header that lists all of the languages you have specified in
alphabetical order. Some web sites can use this <br>
information to return pages to you in a specific
language.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you need to get more
complicated than this, use the more general purpose
-http_header to create your own header. There is a partial
list of language abbreviations (taken <br>
from Debian) included as part of the Linklint
documentation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Remote URL Checking <br>
A remote URL check is used to see if a remote URL exists (or
has been recently modified). Links in the remote pages are
not checked nor does Linklint look for named anchors in <br>
remote URLs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Remote URL checking can be used
to check all of the &quot;remote&quot; links on your site
(those that link to pages on other sites) or it can check a
list of URLs. There are several ways <br>
to specify which remote URLs to check:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">linklint
http://somehost/file.html</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Checks to see if /file.html
exists on somehost. Multiple URLs can be entered on the
command line, in an @commandfile, or in an @@httpfile. Every
URL to be checked must begin <br>
with &quot;http://&quot;. This will disable site
checking.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">linklint @@httpfile</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Checks all the remote http URLs
found in httpfile. Anything in the file starting with
&quot;http://&quot; is considered to be a URL. If the file
looks like a remoteX.txt file generated by <br>
Linklint then all failed URLs will be cross referenced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">linklint @@ -doc linkdoc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Assuming you have already done a
site check and used -doc linkdoc to put all of your output
files in the linkdoc directory, Linklint will check all the
remote links that were <br>
found on your site and cross reference all failed URLs
without doing a site check. You can use the -netmod or
-netset flags to enable the status-cache.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">linklint -net [site check
options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -net flag tells Linklint to
check all remote links after doing either a local or HTTP
site check site. If you are having memory problems,
don&rsquo;t use the -net option, instead <br>
use one of the @@ options above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other Remote URL Options <br>
-timeout t <br>
Times out after t seconds (default 15) when getting files
via http. Once data is received, an additional t seconds is
allowed. The timeout is disabled on Windows machines <br>
since the Windows port of Perl does not support the
&quot;alarm()&quot; function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-delay d <br>
Delays d seconds between requests to the same host (default
0). This is a friendly thing to do especially if you are
checking many links on the same host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-redirect <br>
Checks for &lt;meta&gt; redirects in the headers of remote
URLs that are html files. If a redirect is found it is
followed. This feature is disabled if the status cache is
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-proxy hostname[:port] <br>
Sends all remote HTTP requests through the proxy server
hostname and the optional port. This allows you to check
remote URLs or (new with version 2.3.1) your entire site
<br>
from within a firewall that has an http proxy server. Some
error messages (relating to host errors) may not be
available through a proxy server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-concise_url <br>
Turns off printing successful URLs to STDOUT during remote
link checking.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Status Cache Options <br>
The Status Cache is a very powerful feature. It allows you
to keep track of recent changes in all of the remote
(off-site) pages you link to. You can then use the Linklint
output <br>
files to quickly check changed pages to see if they still
meet your needs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The flags below make use of the
status cache file linklint.url (kept in your HOME or
LINKLINT directory). This file keeps track of the
modification dates of all the remote URLs <br>
that you check.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-netmod <br>
Operates just like -net but makes use of the status cache.
Newly checked URLs will be entered in the cache. Linklint
will tell you which (previously cached) URLs have been <br>
modified since the last -netset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-netset <br>
Like -netmod but also resets the last modified status in the
cache for all URLs that checked ok. If you always use
-netset, modified URLs will be reported just once.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-retry <br>
Only checks URLs that have a host fail status in the cache.
Sometimes a URL fails because its host is temporarily down.
This flag enables you to recheck just those links. <br>
An easy way to recheck all the cached URLs with host
failures is &quot;linklint @@ -retry&quot;. Use
&quot;linklint @@linkdoc/remoteX.txt -retry&quot; if you
want failed URLs to be cross <br>
referenced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-flush <br>
Removes all URLs from the cache that are not currently being
checked. The -retry flag has no effect on which URLs are
flushed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-checksum <br>
Ensures that every URL that has been modified is reported as
such. This flag can make the remote checking take longer.
Many of the pages that require a checksum are <br>
dynamically generated and will always be reported as
modified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-cache directory <br>
Reads and writes the linklint.url cache file in this
directory. The default directory is set by your LINKLINT or
HOME environment variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Output Options <br>
No output files are generated by default, only progress and
a brief summary of the results are printed to the screen.
You can produce complete documentation (split up into <br>
separate files) in a -doc directory or put selected output
in a single -out file or by redirecting the standard output
to a file. See the Output File Specification section for a
<br>
detailed description of all output files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Multi File Output <br>
-doc linkdoc <br>
Sends all output to the linkdoc directory. The output is
divided into separate .txt and .html files. Complete
documentation is always produced regardless of the single
file <br>
flags.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The file index.txt contains an
index to all the other files; index.html is an HTML version
of the index. The index files for remote URL checking are
ur_lindex.txt and <br>
url_index.html.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-textonly <br>
Prevents any HTML files from being created in the -doc
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-htmlonly <br>
Erases redundant text files in the -doc directory after they
have been used to create the HTML output files. The files
remote.txt and remoteX.txt are not erased since they <br>
can be used by Linklint to recheck remote URLs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-docbase base <br>
Overrides the default base expression used for directing a
browser to the resources listed in the output HTML files.
The base is prepended to local links in the output HTML <br>
files. This only affects the links in HTML output files, it
has no effect on what is displayed in these files.
Ordinarily this flag would only be used during a local site
<br>
check to set the base to &quot;http://host&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-output_frames <br>
All HTML output data files are linked to from index.html. If
you use this flag then the the data files will be opened up
in a new frame (window) which can be handy in some <br>
cases since it always leaves the index.html file open in its
own window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-output_index filename <br>
The output index files were previously named linklint.txt
and linklint.html. These have now been changed to index.txt
and index.html. You can use the -output_index option <br>
to change this name back to &quot;linklint&quot; or to
something else.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-url_doc_prefix url/ <br>
By default, the output files associate with remote URL
checking all start with &quot;url&quot;. You can change this
with the -url_doc_prefix option. If the url_doc_prefix
contains a <br>
&quot;/&quot; character then the appropriate directory will
be created (as a subdirectory of the -doc directory).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dont_output xxxx <br>
Don&rsquo;t create output files that contain
&quot;xxxx&quot;. Can be repeated. Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dont_output &quot;X$&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will supress the output of all
cross reference files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Single File Output <br>
-error <br>
Lists missing files and other errors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-out file <br>
Sends list output and summary information to file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-list <br>
Lists all found files, links, directories etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-warn <br>
Lists all warnings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-xref <br>
Adds cross references to the lists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-forward <br>
Sorts lists by referring file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Debug and other Flags <br>
-db1 <br>
Debugs command line input and linkset expressions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-db2 <br>
Prints the name of every file that gets checked (not just
HTML files).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-db3 <br>
Debugs HTML parser, prints out tags and resulting links.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-db4 <br>
Debugs socket connection (kind of).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-db5 <br>
Not used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-db6 <br>
Details last-modified status for remote URLs (requires
-netset or -netmod).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-db7 <br>
Prints brief debug information while checking remote
URLs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-db8 <br>
Prints all http headers while checking remote URLs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-db9 <br>
Generates random http errors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-version <br>
Gives version information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-help <br>
Lists a few simple examples of how to use Linklint.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-help_all <br>
Lists all help (contained in program) including every input
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-quiet <br>
Disables printing progress to the screen.</p>
