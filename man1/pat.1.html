<i>Pat</i> and its associated programs generate patches for any package that has
  been stored under RCS. These programs hide many of the details of RCS that get
  in your way when constructing and maintaining a package. All you need to do to
  create a new patch is to edit your files, run pat, and furnish some
  descriptions to RCS and in the generated patch file. Details such as how to
  initialize a new RCS file, what the comment string should be, how create a new
  branch, how to deal with subdirectories, how to do diffs and how to organize
  the patch file are handled automatically.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Before using any of the pat programs you must initialize your package by running
  packinit in the top-level directory of your package. This produces a .package
  file that all of the dist programs make use of.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In any of the programs that want a filelist, if you specify <b>-a</b> instead,
  all files in MANIFEST.new will be processed. In any of the programs that want
  a patchlist, a null patchlist means the current patch. You may use hyphens,
  commas and spaces to delimit patch numbers. If the right side of a hyphen is
  the null string, the current patchlevel is assumed as the maximum value. All
  the programs invoked with <b>-h</b> will print a small usage message with the
  meaning of each available options. The <b>-V</b> option gives the current
  version number.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Pat itself is a wrapper program that calls patcil, patdiff, and patmake. Usually
  you can just invoke pat and ignore all the others. Pat will update the
  MANIFEST file, if necessary (it will be an exact copy of the MANIFEST.new
  file, provided that a MANIFEST already existed), eventually calling patcil on
  it.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you specify <b>-n</b> instead of a filelist, pat will find all files that are
  newer than patchlevel.h, put you into an editor to trim down the list, then
  use that file list. If every file of the list is removed, <i>pat</i> will be
  aborted.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Patcil</i> is used to do a ci -l on any listed files. (It is assumed that you
  always want to keep your files checked out.) In addition to the <b>-a</b>
  switch, there is a <b>-b</b> switch which does a quick checkin of a set of
  files. Instead of calling rcs on each file, it calls rcs on the whole list of
  files. This is useful for checking in a trunk revision. When you are checking
  in a new trunk revision you might also want to use the <b>-s</b> flag which
  will strip out old RCS Log entries from the previous revision so that you can
  start over fresh. You probably should also use a <b>-f</b> which is passed
  through to the ci to force unchanged files to be checked in. To check in a new
  trunk revision, I say
<pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
	patcil -s -f -a
<div class="Pp"></div>
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Patcil will ask for the log entry instead of letting ci do it, and has a little
  prompter built in that lets you manipulate the message in various ways. Type h
  for a listing of what you can do. One of the nicest things is that you can pop
  up into an editor, optionally with a diff listing of the changes since the
  last patch, in case you've forgotten what you changed. If you type a CR as the
  first thing, it includes the previous log message. Exit the prompter with a
  CR.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There are two different ways to use patcil. You can either call patcil yourself,
  or let pat call it for you. It doesn't matter how many times you call patcil
  before running pat, since patdiff knows what the last patch base is to compare
  with. Patcil can be called in any of your directories; the other programs must
  be called in your top-level directory (or in bugs, when meaningful).
<div class="Pp"></div>
When you are creating a new file at a given patchlevel, you must patcil it with
  the <b>-p</b> option. Otherwise, it will simply be checked-in as a new trunk
  revision. The name of the file will be added to the MANIFEST.new if it does
  not already appear in it. If the name is found along with a description, that
  description will be passed through to rcs to properly initialize the RCS file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Patbase</i> can be used to reset the patch base to the current version when
  you've scrapped the previous patch sequence and are making a new distribution
  kit. What it really does is an rcs -Nlastpat:REV, where REV is the current
  revision. If patdiff blows up and you want to set the patch base back to some
  previous version, you have to call rcs -Nlastpat:REV yourself.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Patdiff</i> actually does the diffs that go into the patch, comparing
  whatever version -Nlastpat points to with the most recently checked in
  version. It then updates -Nlastpat to point to the current version. It leaves
  the diff sitting in the bugs subdirectory for patmake to pick up. It can
  either use rcsdiff, or a diff command of your choice specified when you run
  packinit, in case your diff is better than rcsdiff.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Patlog</i> is invoked by <i>patmake</i> usually, to update the
  <i>ChangeLog</i> file (or whatever name that file has been given when you ran
  <i>packinit</i>). It will gather log messages and launch an editor for you to
  make the necessary updates. If you have configured your package to also
  include RCS logs in the <i>ChangeLog</i>, another editor session will be
  launched for those too. Finally, a final log is built as a candidate entry for
  <i>ChangeLog</i>, which you may also modify as you wish.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When you don't have configured a <i>ChangeLog</i> file, <i>patlog</i> will only
  gather the information it needs to pass on to <i>patmake</i> and will exit. If
  you wish to call it yourself, you must do that after a least one sucessfull
  <i>patdiff</i> run. I recommend using the <b>-n</b> option the first time, and
  then use the <b>-u</b> option along with <b>-n</b> on subsequent runs to
  recreate files only when needed. The <b>-r</b> option (which supersedes
  <b>-u</b>) prevents <i>patlog</i> from recreating an existing file, even if it
  is out of date.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Patlog</i> will call <i>patcil</i> and <i>patdiff</i> on your
  <i>ChangeLog</i> file (after having stuffed the candidate log entry you edited
  at the top of the file), unless prevented to do so by the <b>-n</b> option.
  This means the issued patch will update <i>ChangeLog</i> with current patch
  information, as you would expect it.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Patmake</i> combines all the pieces of the patch into one file and invokes an
  editor so you can add the subject and description. It throws all your log
  messages in as Subjects and as Description, under the assumption that it's
  easier to delete what you don't want than to remember everything you did.
  You'll also want to expand each item in the Description so they don't just
  repeat the Subject lines. If you have a <i>ChangeLog</i> file, this must have
  been done already, or your <i>ChangeLog</i> will not accurately represent what
  is described in the patch, given that it has already been updated when
  <i>patmake</i> puts together all the pieces (see the note about <i>patlog</i>
  above).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Big patches will be split in order to keep size of each patch to a reasonable
  size. This is handled automatically, so you don't have to bother with it. The
  priority of each patch is merely intuited by <i>patmake</i>, given the
  assumption that small changes have a great priority.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Patsend, patpost and patftp are used to distribute your patches to the world.
  <i>Patsend</i> mails a set of patches to a set of recipients. The <b>-u</b>
  switch adds all the currently registered users who have asked for patches to
  be mailed to them, as well as the recipients specified while running
  <i>packinit</i>. The <b>-i</b> switch includes information with the patch
  about how the user may deregister themselves so they do not receive future
  patches automatically; this is also the default when the <b>-u</b> switch is
  used. <i>Patpost</i> posts a set of patches to a set of newsgroups.
  <i>Patftp</i> merely copies the patch into your public ftp directory.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Patnotify</i> simply notifies users that a new patch has been released so
  that they can retrieve it by themselves from an archive site or via e-mail if
  they are interested. The <b>-u</b> switch can be used to include all the
  currently registered users who have asked for such a notification. The message
  includes the patch priority and description, as well as instructions on how to
  automatically request the patch (which will work only if you have
  <i>mailagent</i> installed).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Both <i>patsend</i> and <i>patnotify</i> let you edit the address list before
  actually sending anything, unless you add the <b>-q</b> option.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Patname</i> can be used to tag a set of files with a symbolic name (specified
  with <b>-v</b>). This will set the name for the most recent revision of each
  file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Patsnap</i> will get a snapshot of your release by creating a SNAPSHOT file
  (name can be changed via <b>-o</b>) listing the file names and the latest RCS
  revision number for that file. Such snapshots can be used to identify the
  release at some random patchlevel and then later be able to retrieve it by
  feeding the snapshot file to <i>patcol</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Patcol</i> will check out a locked version of a file, eventually in an
  alternate directory (specified with <b>-d</b>, thus mirroring the distribution
  tree). All the files which have no RCS counterpart (e.g. patchlevel.h) will be
  simply copied by patcol. This is used by makedist to fake the distribution
  before making the kits. By default, patcol will not do the copyright expansion
  processing, but clients like <i>makedist</i> force it by using its <b>-C</b>
  option. Alternatively, you may force copying of the checked-out version into a
  directory by using the <b>-c</b> switch in conjunction with <b>-d</b> (or that
  former switch is simply ignored).
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Patcol</i> can also take its file list from a SNAPSHOT file via the <b>-S</b>
  switch, in which case it will check out the files using the RCS version
  specified by the snapshot file, such as one created by <i>patsnap</i>. You may
  instead specify <b>-a</b>, <b>-m</b> or <b>-n</b> to respectively use all the
  files in MANIFEST.new, all the modified files (the one which have been
  <i>patcil</i>ed), or all the files newer than <i>patchlevel.h</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Patclean</i> will remove the working files after having checked in all the
  changes. You may restores your working files by using patcol.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Patindex</i> may be used from the top level directory or within the
  <i>bugs</i> directory. It will list all the patches and their <i>Subject:</i>
  lines. This program knows about compressed patches and will decompress them
  while producing the listing.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="RCS_LAYER"><a class="selflink" href="#RCS_LAYER">RCS
  LAYER</a></h1>
This section describes the RCS layer, in case something in the tools breaks, so
  that you may fix your RCS files and restart the operation.
<div class="Pp"></div>
All the patch tools get the main RCS trunk revision number out of your
  <i>.package</i> files, say it's 2.5. Then, at the time you ran
  <i>packinit</i>, you have chosen a branch for patches, usually number 1, which
  means all your modifications will be stored on the 2.5.1 RCS branch. The tools
  will create the branch for you when the time comes.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Each last released revision is tagged with an RCS <i>lastpat</i> symbol. When
  the patch is built by <i>patdiff</i>, the lattest version on the 2.5.1 branch
  is compared with the one tagged as <i>lastpat</i>. This is why you may safely
  issue more than one <i>patcil</i> beffore issuing the patch and still have it
  all worked out. Of course <i>patdiff</i> will move the <i>lastpat</i> tag to
  the lattest branch revision after processing a given file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
All the log messages and the modified files are kept in your <i>bugs</i>
  directory, in hidden files (name starting with a dot). Those logs will be
  collected when the patch is issued and the modified files are used by
  <i>pat</i>'s <b>-m</b> switch.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Patdiff</i> collects its patch hunks under the <i>bugs</i> directory, in
  files terminating with a <i>.nn</i> extension, where <i>nn</i> represents the
  current patch level + 1. (Which is going to be the next patchlevel when the
  patch will be made by <i>patmake</i>, unless it is too big to fit in one
  file).
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Patlog</i> prepares a set of files for <i>patmake</i>: the <i>.clog</i> file
  collects the information that will go under the Description: section within
  the patch, and <i>.xlog</i> ones collect the <i>ChangeLog</i> candidate entry.
  Finally, <i>.rlog</i> files store the RCS information that is to be included
  in the <i>ChangeLog</i>, if requested. Note that the topmost three lines are
  garbage and are ignored by all the tools handling those files.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In order to start up a new baseline (i.e. to change the RCS trunk revision
  number), you need to rerun <i>packinit</i> and change that number. Then issue
  a new <i>patcil</i>, probably with the <b>-s</b>, <b>-a</b> and <b>-f</b>
  options...
