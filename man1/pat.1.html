<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Pat and its associated programs generate patches for any
package that has been stored under RCS. These programs hide
many of the details of RCS that get in your way when
con&acirc; <br>
structing and maintaining a package. All you need to do to
create a new patch is to edit your files, run pat, and
furnish some descriptions to RCS and in the generated patch
<br>
file. Details such as how to initialize a new RCS file, what
the comment string should be, how create a new branch, how
to deal with subdirectories, how to do diffs and how to <br>
organize the patch file are handled automatically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Before using any of the pat
programs you must initialize your package by running
packinit in the top-level directory of your package. This
produces a .package file that all of <br>
the dist programs make use of.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In any of the programs that want
a filelist, if you specify -a instead, all files in
MANIFEST.new will be processed. In any of the programs that
want a patchlist, a null patch&acirc; <br>
list means the current patch. You may use hyphens, commas
and spaces to delimit patch numbers. If the right side of a
hyphen is the null string, the current patchlevel is <br>
assumed as the maximum value. All the programs invoked with
-h will print a small usage message with the meaning of each
available options. The -V option gives the current
ver&acirc; <br>
sion number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pat itself is a wrapper program
that calls patcil, patdiff, and patmake. Usually you can
just invoke pat and ignore all the others. Pat will update
the MANIFEST file, if neces&acirc; <br>
sary (it will be an exact copy of the MANIFEST.new file,
provided that a MANIFEST already existed), eventually
calling patcil on it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you specify -n instead of a
filelist, pat will find all files that are newer than
patchlevel.h, put you into an editor to trim down the list,
then use that file list. If <br>
every file of the list is removed, pat will be aborted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Patcil is used to do a ci -l on
any listed files. (It is assumed that you always want to
keep your files checked out.) In addition to the -a switch,
there is a -b switch which <br>
does a quick checkin of a set of files. Instead of calling
rcs on each file, it calls rcs on the whole list of files.
This is useful for checking in a trunk revision. When you
<br>
are checking in a new trunk revision you might also want to
use the -s flag which will strip out old RCS Log entries
from the previous revision so that you can start over fresh.
<br>
You probably should also use a -f which is passed through to
the ci to force unchanged files to be checked in. To check
in a new trunk revision, I say</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">patcil -s -f -a</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Patcil will ask for the log
entry instead of letting ci do it, and has a little prompter
built in that lets you manipulate the message in various
ways. Type h for a listing of <br>
what you can do. One of the nicest things is that you can
pop up into an editor, optionally with a diff listing of the
changes since the last patch, in case you&rsquo;ve forgotten
<br>
what you changed. If you type a CR as the first thing, it
includes the previous log message. Exit the prompter with a
CR.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are two different ways to
use patcil. You can either call patcil yourself, or let pat
call it for you. It doesn&rsquo;t matter how many times you
call patcil before running <br>
pat, since patdiff knows what the last patch base is to
compare with. Patcil can be called in any of your
directories; the other programs must be called in your
top-level direc&acirc; <br>
tory (or in bugs, when meaningful).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When you are creating a new file
at a given patchlevel, you must patcil it with the -p
option. Otherwise, it will simply be checked-in as a new
trunk revision. The name of the <br>
file will be added to the MANIFEST.new if it does not
already appear in it. If the name is found along with a
description, that description will be passed through to rcs
to prop&acirc; <br>
erly initialize the RCS file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Patbase can be used to reset the
patch base to the current version when you&rsquo;ve scrapped
the previous patch sequence and are making a new
distribution kit. What it really does is <br>
an rcs -Nlastpat:REV, where REV is the current revision. If
patdiff blows up and you want to set the patch base back to
some previous version, you have to call rcs -Nlastpat:REV
<br>
yourself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Patdiff actually does the diffs
that go into the patch, comparing whatever version -Nlastpat
points to with the most recently checked in version. It then
updates -Nlastpat to <br>
point to the current version. It leaves the diff sitting in
the bugs subdirectory for patmake to pick up. It can either
use rcsdiff, or a diff command of your choice specified <br>
when you run packinit, in case your diff is better than
rcsdiff.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Patlog is invoked by patmake
usually, to update the ChangeLog file (or whatever name that
file has been given when you ran packinit). It will gather
log messages and launch an <br>
editor for you to make the necessary updates. If you have
configured your package to also include RCS logs in the
ChangeLog, another editor session will be launched for those
<br>
too. Finally, a final log is built as a candidate entry for
ChangeLog, which you may also modify as you wish.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When you don&rsquo;t have
configured a ChangeLog file, patlog will only gather the
information it needs to pass on to patmake and will exit. If
you wish to call it yourself, you must <br>
do that after a least one sucessfull patdiff run. I
recommend using the -n option the first time, and then use
the -u option along with -n on subsequent runs to recreate
files <br>
only when needed. The -r option (which supersedes -u)
prevents patlog from recreating an existing file, even if it
is out of date.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Patlog will call patcil and
patdiff on your ChangeLog file (after having stuffed the
candidate log entry you edited at the top of the file),
unless prevented to do so by the -n <br>
option. This means the issued patch will update ChangeLog
with current patch information, as you would expect it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Patmake combines all the pieces
of the patch into one file and invokes an editor so you can
add the subject and description. It throws all your log
messages in as Subjects and <br>
as Description, under the assumption that it&rsquo;s easier
to delete what you don&rsquo;t want than to remember
everything you did. You&rsquo;ll also want to expand each
item in the Description <br>
so they don&rsquo;t just repeat the Subject lines. If you
have a ChangeLog file, this must have been done already, or
your ChangeLog will not accurately represent what is
described in <br>
the patch, given that it has already been updated when
patmake puts together all the pieces (see the note about
patlog above).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Big patches will be split in
order to keep size of each patch to a reasonable size. This
is handled automatically, so you don&rsquo;t have to bother
with it. The priority of each <br>
patch is merely intuited by patmake, given the assumption
that small changes have a great priority.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Patsend, patpost and patftp are
used to distribute your patches to the world. Patsend mails
a set of patches to a set of recipients. The -u switch adds
all the currently regis&acirc; <br>
tered users who have asked for patches to be mailed to them,
as well as the recipients specified while running packinit.
The -i switch includes information with the patch about <br>
how the user may deregister themselves so they do not
receive future patches automatically; this is also the
default when the -u switch is used. Patpost posts a set of
patches <br>
to a set of newsgroups. Patftp merely copies the patch into
your public ftp directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Patnotify simply notifies users
that a new patch has been released so that they can retrieve
it by themselves from an archive site or via e-mail if they
are interested. The -u <br>
switch can be used to include all the currently registered
users who have asked for such a notification. The message
includes the patch priority and description, as well as <br>
instructions on how to automatically request the patch
(which will work only if you have mailagent installed).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Both patsend and patnotify let
you edit the address list before actually sending anything,
unless you add the -q option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Patname can be used to tag a set
of files with a symbolic name (specified with -v). This will
set the name for the most recent revision of each file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Patsnap will get a snapshot of
your release by creating a SNAPSHOT file (name can be
changed via -o) listing the file names and the latest RCS
revision number for that file. Such <br>
snapshots can be used to identify the release at some random
patchlevel and then later be able to retrieve it by feeding
the snapshot file to patcol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Patcol will check out a locked
version of a file, eventually in an alternate directory
(specified with -d, thus mirroring the distribution tree).
All the files which have no RCS <br>
counterpart (e.g. patchlevel.h) will be simply copied by
patcol. This is used by makedist to fake the distribution
before making the kits. By default, patcol will not do the
<br>
copyright expansion processing, but clients like makedist
force it by using its -C option. Alternatively, you may
force copying of the checked-out version into a directory by
<br>
using the -c switch in conjunction with -d (or that former
switch is simply ignored).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Patcol can also take its file
list from a SNAPSHOT file via the -S switch, in which case
it will check out the files using the RCS version specified
by the snapshot file, such as <br>
one created by patsnap. You may instead specify -a, -m or -n
to respectively use all the files in MANIFEST.new, all the
modified files (the one which have been patciled), or all
<br>
the files newer than patchlevel.h.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Patclean will remove the working
files after having checked in all the changes. You may
restores your working files by using patcol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Patindex may be used from the
top level directory or within the bugs directory. It will
list all the patches and their Subject: lines. This program
knows about compressed <br>
patches and will decompress them while producing the
listing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RCS LAYER <br>
This section describes the RCS layer, in case something in
the tools breaks, so that you may fix your RCS files and
restart the operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All the patch tools get the main
RCS trunk revision number out of your .package files, say
it&rsquo;s 2.5. Then, at the time you ran packinit, you have
chosen a branch for patches, <br>
usually number 1, which means all your modifications will be
stored on the 2.5.1 RCS branch. The tools will create the
branch for you when the time comes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each last released revision is
tagged with an RCS lastpat symbol. When the patch is built
by patdiff, the lattest version on the 2.5.1 branch is
compared with the one tagged as <br>
lastpat. This is why you may safely issue more than one
patcil beffore issuing the patch and still have it all
worked out. Of course patdiff will move the lastpat tag to
the lat&acirc; <br>
test branch revision after processing a given file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All the log messages and the
modified files are kept in your bugs directory, in hidden
files (name starting with a dot). Those logs will be
collected when the patch is issued and <br>
the modified files are used by pat&rsquo;s -m switch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Patdiff collects its patch hunks
under the bugs directory, in files terminating with a .nn
extension, where nn represents the current patch level + 1.
(Which is going to be the <br>
next patchlevel when the patch will be made by patmake,
unless it is too big to fit in one file).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Patlog prepares a set of files
for patmake: the .clog file collects the information that
will go under the Description: section within the patch, and
.xlog ones collect the <br>
ChangeLog candidate entry. Finally, .rlog files store the
RCS information that is to be included in the ChangeLog, if
requested. Note that the topmost three lines are garbage
<br>
and are ignored by all the tools handling those files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to start up a new
baseline (i.e. to change the RCS trunk revision number), you
need to rerun packinit and change that number. Then issue a
new patcil, probably with the <br>
-s, -a and -f options...</p>
