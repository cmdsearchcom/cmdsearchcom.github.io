<p>BMORE(1) General Commands Manual BMORE(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
bmore - browse through a binary file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
bmore [ -acdi ] [ -n lines ] [ -w cols ] [ +linenumber ] [
+/ASCII-pattern ] [ +-pattern ] [ filename ... ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
more is a filter that displays the contents of a binary file
on the terminal, one screenful at a time. It normally pauses
after each screenful, and prints --More-- at the bottom <br>
of the screen. bmore provides a two-line overlap between
screens for continuity. If bmore is reading from a file
rather than a pipe, the percentage of characters displayed
so <br>
far is also shown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bmore scrolls up to display one
more screen line in response to a RETURN character; it
displays another screenful in response to a SPACE character.
Other commands are listed <br>
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The screen is divided in three
sections or panes: The byte offset (extreme left), the hex
pane (middle), and an ascii pane (right) which shows as
printable characters those bytes <br>
in the hex pane. On an 80 column terminal there will be
sixteen hex values and their ASCII values on each screen
line. Note that (as one would expect) the first byte has the
<br>
offset 0 (zero).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bmore sets the terminal to
noecho mode, so that the output can be continuous. Commands
that you type do not normally show up on your terminal,
except for the / , &nbsp;and ! com&acirc; <br>
mands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the standard output is not a
terminal, more acts just like cat(1V), except that a header
is printed before each file in a series.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-a ASCII mode: no hex representation of the contents. Non
printable characters are displayed as a dot (.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Clear before displaying.
Redrawing the screen instead of scrolling.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Display error messages rather
than ringing the terminal bell if an unrecognized command is
used. This is helpful for inexperienced users.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i Ignore case for
searching.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n lines <br>
Displays the indicated number of lines in each screenful,
rather than the default (the number of lines in the terminal
screen less two).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w cols <br>
Display number of cols in each line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+linenumber <br>
Start up at linenumber.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+/ASCII-pattern <br>
Start up at the line containing the regular expression
pattern. Note: unlike editors, this construct should not end
with a &lsquo;/&rsquo;. If it does, then the trailing slash
is <br>
taken as a character in the search pattern.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USAGE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Commands <br>
The commands take effect immediately; it is not necessary to
type a carriage return. Up to the time when the command
character itself is given, the user may type the line kill
<br>
character to cancel the numerical argument being formed. In
addition, the user may type the erase character to redisplay
the &lsquo;--More--(xx%)&rsquo; message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the following commands, i is
a numerical argument (1 by default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">iSPACE Display another
screenful, or i more lines if i is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">iRETURN Display another line, or
i more lines, if specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">i^D (CTRL-D) Display (scroll
down) 11 more lines. i is given, the scroll size is set to
i.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">id Same as ^D.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">iz Same as SPACE, except that i,
if present, becomes the new default number of lines per
screenful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">is Skip i lines and then print a
screenful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if Skip i screenfuls and then
print a screenful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">i^B (CTRL-B) Skip back i
screenfuls and then print a screenful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">b Same as ^B (CTRL-D).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">q <br>
Q Exit from more.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">= Display the current line
number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">v Drop into the bvi(1) editor at
the current offset of the current file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">w Drop into the bvi(1) editor at
the current offset of the current file. Only the portion of
the file displayed on the screen will be loaded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">h Help. Give a description of
all the more commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">i/pattern Search for the ith
occurrence of the regular expression pattern. Display the
screenful starting at the file position that contains the
ith match for the regular <br>
expression ASCII-pattern, or the end of a pipe, whichever
comes first. If bmore is displaying a file and there is no
such match, its position in the file remains <br>
unchanged. Regular expressions can be edited using erase and
kill characters. Erasing back past the first column cancels
the search command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&acute; Single quote. Go
to the point from which the last search started. If no
search has been performed in the current file, go to the
beginning of the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">!command Invoke a shell to
execute command. The characters % and !, when used within
command are replaced with the current filename and the
previous shell command, respec&acirc; <br>
tively. If there is no current filename, % is not expanded.
Prepend a backslash to these characters to escape
expansion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">i:n Skip to the ith next
filename given in the command line, or to the last filename
in the list if i is out of range.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">i:p Skip to the ith previous
filename given in the command line, or to the first filename
if i is out of range. If given while more is positioned
within a file, go to the <br>
beginning of the file. If more is reading from a pipe, more
simply rings the terminal bell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">:f Display the current filename
and offset number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">:q <br>
:Q Exit from bmore (same as q or Q ).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">. Dot. Repeat the previous
command.</p>
