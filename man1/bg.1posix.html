<p>BG(1POSIX) POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s Manual
BG(1POSIX)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROLOG <br>
This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s
Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of <br>
Linux behavior), or the interface may not be implemented on
Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
bg &acirc; run jobs in the background</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
bg [job_id...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
If job control is enabled (see the description of set
&acirc;m), the bg utility shall resume suspended jobs from
the current environment (see Section 2.12, Shell Execution
Environment) <br>
by running them as background jobs. If the job specified by
job_id is already a running background job, the bg utility
shall have no effect and shall exit successfully.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using bg to place a job into the
background shall cause its process ID to become
&lsquo;&lsquo;known in the current shell execution
environment&rsquo;&rsquo;, as if it had been started as an
asynchro&acirc; <br>
nous list; see Section 2.9.3.1, Examples.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERANDS <br>
The following operand shall be supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">job_id Specify the job to be
resumed as a background job. If no job_id operand is given,
the most recently suspended job shall be used. The format of
job_id is described in <br>
the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008, Section
3.204, Job Control Job ID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDIN <br>
Not used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUT FILES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
The following environment variables shall affect the
execution of bg:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LANG Provide a default value for
the internationalization variables that are unset or null.
(See the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008,
Section 8.2, Internationaliza&acirc; <br>
tion Variables for the precedence of internationalization
variables used to determine the values of locale
categories.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_ALL If set to a non-empty
string value, override the values of all the other
internationalization variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_CTYPE Determine the locale
for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text data as
characters (for example, single-byte as opposed to
multi-byte characters in argu&acirc; <br>
ments).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_MESSAGES <br>
Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
standard error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NLSPATH Determine the location
of message catalogs for the processing of LC_MESSAGES.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDOUT <br>
The output of bg shall consist of a line in the format:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;[%d] %s0,
&lt;job-number&gt;, &lt;command&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where the fields are as
follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;job-number&gt; <br>
A number that can be used to identify the job to the wait,
fg, and kill utilities. Using these utilities, the job can
be identified by prefixing the job number with <br>
&rsquo;%&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;command&gt; The associated
command that was given to the shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDERR <br>
The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT FILES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTENDED DESCRIPTION <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The following exit values shall be returned:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 Successful completion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS <br>
If job control is disabled, the bg utility shall exit with
an error and no job shall be placed in the background.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following sections are
informative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">APPLICATION USAGE <br>
A job is generally suspended by typing the SUSP character
(&lt;control&gt;&acirc;Z on most systems); see the Base
Definitions volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008, Chapter 11,
General Terminal Interface. <br>
At that point, bg can put the job into the background. This
is most effective when the job is expecting no terminal
input and its output has been redirected to non-terminal
<br>
files. A background job can be forced to stop when it has
terminal output by issuing the command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">stty tostop</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A background job can be stopped
with the command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kill &acirc;s stop job ID</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The bg utility does not work as
expected when it is operating in its own utility execution
environment because that environment has no suspended jobs.
In the following examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">... | xargs bg <br>
(bg)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">each bg operates in a different
environment and does not share its parent shell&rsquo;s
understanding of jobs. For this reason, bg is generally
implemented as a shell regular built-in.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RATIONALE <br>
The extensions to the shell specified in this volume of
POSIX.1&acirc;2008 have mostly been based on features
provided by the KornShell. The job control features provided
by bg, fg, <br>
and jobs are also based on the KornShell. The standard
developers examined the characteristics of the C shell
versions of these utilities and found that differences
exist. <br>
Despite widespread use of the C shell, the KornShell
versions were selected for this volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008
to maintain a degree of uniformity with the rest of the
KornShell fea&acirc; <br>
tures selected (such as the very popular command line
editing features).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The bg utility is expected to
wrap its output if the output exceeds the number of display
columns.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FUTURE DIRECTIONS <br>
None.</p>
