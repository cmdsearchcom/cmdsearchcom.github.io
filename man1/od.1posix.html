<p>OD(1POSIX) POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s Manual
OD(1POSIX)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROLOG <br>
This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s
Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of <br>
Linux behavior), or the interface may not be implemented on
Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
od &acirc; dump files in various formats</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
od [&acirc;v] [&acirc;A address_base] [&acirc;j skip]
[&acirc;N count] [&acirc;t type_string]... <br>
[file...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">od [&acirc;bcdosx] [file]
[[+]offset[.][b]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The od utility shall write the contents of its input files
to standard output in a user-specified format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The od utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume
of POSIX.1&acirc;2008, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax
Guidelines, except that the order of presentation of the
&acirc;t options and <br>
the &acirc;bcdosx options is significant.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options shall be
supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;A address_base <br>
Specify the input offset base. See the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
section. The application shall ensure that the address_base
option-argument is a character. The characters <br>
&rsquo;d&rsquo;, &rsquo;o&rsquo;, and &rsquo;x&rsquo;
specify that the offset base shall be written in decimal,
octal, or hexadecimal, respectively. The character
&rsquo;n&rsquo; specifies that the offset shall not <br>
be written.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;b Interpret bytes in
octal. This shall be equivalent to &acirc;t o1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;c Interpret bytes as
characters specified by the current setting of the LC_CTYPE
category. Certain non-graphic characters appear as C
escapes: &quot;NUL= &quot;, &quot;BS=,FF=,&quot;,
&quot;HT=&quot;; others appear as 3-digit <br>
&quot;NL=0, &quot;CR= octal numbers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;d Interpret words
(two-byte units) in unsigned decimal. This shall be
equivalent to &acirc;t u2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;j skip Jump over skip
bytes from the beginning of the input. The od utility shall
read or seek past the first skip bytes in the concatenated
input files. If the combined input <br>
is not at least skip bytes long, the od utility shall write
a diagnostic message to standard error and exit with a
non-zero exit status.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, the skip
option-argument shall be interpreted as a decimal number.
With a leading 0x or 0X, the offset shall be interpreted as
a hexadecimal number; other&acirc; <br>
wise, with a leading &rsquo;0&rsquo;, the offset shall be
interpreted as an octal number. Appending the character
&rsquo;b&rsquo;, &rsquo;k&rsquo;, or &rsquo;m&rsquo; to
offset shall cause it to be interpreted as a <br>
multiple of 512, 1024, or 1048576 bytes, respectively. If
the skip number is hexadecimal, any appended &rsquo;b&rsquo;
shall be considered to be the final hexadecimal digit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;N count Format no more
than count bytes of input. By default, count shall be
interpreted as a decimal number. With a leading 0x or 0X,
count shall be interpreted as a hexadeci&acirc; <br>
mal number; otherwise, with a leading &rsquo;0&rsquo;, it
shall be interpreted as an octal number. If count bytes of
input (after successfully skipping, if &acirc;j skip is
specified) <br>
are not available, it shall not be considered an error; the
od utility shall format the input that is available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;o Interpret words
(two-byte units) in octal. This shall be equivalent to
&acirc;t o2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;s Interpret words
(two-byte units) in signed decimal. This shall be equivalent
to &acirc;t d2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;t type_string <br>
Specify one or more output types. See the EXTENDED
DESCRIPTION section. The application shall ensure that the
type_string option-argument is a string specifying the <br>
types to be used when writing the input data. The string
shall consist of the type specification characters a, c, d,
f, o, u, and x, specifying named character, charac&acirc;
<br>
ter, signed decimal, floating point, octal, unsigned
decimal, and hexadecimal, respectively. The type
specification characters d, f, o, u, and x can be followed
by an <br>
optional unsigned decimal integer that specifies the number
of bytes to be transformed by each instance of the output
type. The type specification character f can be <br>
followed by an optional F, D, or L indicating that the
conversion should be applied to an item of type float,
double, or long double, respectively. The type
specifica&acirc; <br>
tion characters d, o, u, and x can be followed by an
optional C, S, I, or L indicating that the conversion should
be applied to an item of type char, short, int, or <br>
long, respectively. Multiple types can be concatenated
within the same type_string and multiple &acirc;t options
can be specified. Output lines shall be written for each
type <br>
specified in the order in which the type specification
characters are specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;v Write all input data.
Without the &acirc;v option, any number of groups of output
lines, which would be identical to the immediately preceding
group of output lines (except <br>
for the byte offsets), shall be replaced with a line
containing only an &lt;asterisk&gt; (&rsquo;*&rsquo;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;x Interpret words
(two-byte units) in hexadecimal. This shall be equivalent to
&acirc;t x2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Multiple types can be specified
by using multiple &acirc;bcdostx options. Output lines are
written for each type specified in the order in which the
types are specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERANDS <br>
The following operands shall be supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file A pathname of a file to be
read. If no file operands are specified, the standard input
shall be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If there are no more than two
operands, none of the &acirc;A, &acirc;j, &acirc;N,
&acirc;t, or &acirc;v options is specified, and either of
the following is true: the first character of the last
op&acirc; <br>
erand is a &lt;plus-sign&gt; (&rsquo;+&rsquo;), or there are
two operands and the first character of the last operand is
numeric; the last operand shall be interpreted as an offset
oper&acirc; <br>
and on XSI-conformant systems. Under these conditions, the
results are unspecified on systems that are not
XSI-conformant systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[+]offset[.][b] <br>
The offset operand specifies the offset in the file where
dumping is to commence. This operand is normally interpreted
as octal bytes. If &rsquo;.&rsquo; is appended, the offset
<br>
shall be interpreted in decimal. If &rsquo;b&rsquo; is
appended, the offset shall be interpreted in units of 512
bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDIN <br>
The standard input shall be used if no file operands are
specified, and shall be used if a file operand is
&rsquo;&acirc;&rsquo; and the implementation treats the
&rsquo;&acirc;&rsquo; as meaning standard input. <br>
Otherwise, the standard input shall not be used. See the
INPUT FILES section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUT FILES <br>
The input files can be any file type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
The following environment variables shall affect the
execution of od:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LANG Provide a default value for
the internationalization variables that are unset or null.
(See the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008,
Section 8.2, Internationaliza&acirc; <br>
tion Variables for the precedence of internationalization
variables used to determine the values of locale
categories.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_ALL If set to a non-empty
string value, override the values of all the other
internationalization variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_CTYPE Determine the locale
for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text data as
characters (for example, single-byte as opposed to
multi-byte characters in arguments <br>
and input files).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_MESSAGES <br>
Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
standard error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_NUMERIC <br>
Determine the locale for selecting the radix character used
when writing floating-point formatted output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NLSPATH Determine the location
of message catalogs for the processing of LC_MESSAGES.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDOUT <br>
See the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDERR <br>
The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT FILES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTENDED DESCRIPTION <br>
The od utility shall copy sequentially each input file to
standard output, transforming the input data according to
the output types specified by the &acirc;t option or the
&acirc;bcdosx <br>
options. If no output type is specified, the default output
shall be as if &acirc;t oS had been specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The number of bytes transformed
by the output type specifier c may be variable depending on
the LC_CTYPE category.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default number of bytes
transformed by output type specifiers d, f, o, u, and x
corresponds to the various C-language types as follows. If
the c99 compiler is present on the <br>
system, these specifiers shall correspond to the sizes used
by default in that compiler. Otherwise, these sizes may vary
among systems that conform to POSIX.1&acirc;2008.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* For the type specifier
characters d, o, u, and x, the default number of bytes shall
correspond to the size of the underlying
implementation&rsquo;s basic integer type. For these <br>
specifier characters, the implementation shall support
values of the optional number of bytes to be converted
corresponding to the number of bytes in the C-language types
<br>
char, short, int, and long. These numbers can also be
specified by an application as the characters
&rsquo;C&rsquo;, &rsquo;S&rsquo;, &rsquo;I&rsquo;, and
&rsquo;L&rsquo;, respectively. The implementation shall also
sup&acirc; <br>
port the values 1, 2, 4, and 8, even if it provides no
C-Language types of those sizes. The implementation shall
support the decimal value corresponding to the C-language
<br>
type long long. The byte order used when interpreting
numeric values is implementation-defined, but shall
correspond to the order in which a constant of the
corresponding <br>
type is stored in memory on the system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* For the type specifier
character f, the default number of bytes shall correspond to
the number of bytes in the underlying implementation&rsquo;s
basic double precision floating- <br>
point data type. The implementation shall support values of
the optional number of bytes to be converted corresponding
to the number of bytes in the C-language types float, <br>
double, and long double. These numbers can also be specified
by an application as the characters &rsquo;F&rsquo;,
&rsquo;D&rsquo;, and &rsquo;L&rsquo;, respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The type specifier character a
specifies that bytes shall be interpreted as named
characters from the International Reference Version (IRV) of
the ISO/IEC 646:1991 standard. Only <br>
the least significant seven bits of each byte shall be used
for this type specification. Bytes with the values listed in
the following table shall be written using the corre&acirc;
<br>
sponding names for those characters.</p>

<br>
Note: The &quot; 12&quot; value may be written either as lf
or nl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The type specifier character c
specifies that bytes shall be interpreted as characters
specified by the current setting of the LC_CTYPE locale
category. Characters listed in the <br>
table in the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008,
Chapter 5, File Format Notation (&rsquo;\&rsquo;,
&rsquo;&rsquo;, &rsquo;,, &rsquo;0,&rsquo;, &rsquo;&rsquo;,
&rsquo; shall be written as the corresponding &rsquo; <br>
escape sequences, except that &lt;backslash&gt; shall be
written as a single &lt;backslash&gt; and a NUL shall be
written as &rsquo; &rsquo;. Other non-printable characters
shall be written as one <br>
three-digit octal number for each byte in the character.
Printable multi-byte characters shall be written in the area
corresponding to the first byte of the character; the two-
<br>
character sequence &quot;**&quot; shall be written in the
area corresponding to each remaining byte in the character,
as an indication that the character is continued. When
either the &acirc;j <br>
skip or &acirc;N count option is specified along with the c
type specifier, and this results in an attempt to start or
finish in the middle of a multi-byte character, the result
is <br>
implementation-defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The input data shall be
manipulated in blocks, where a block is defined as a
multiple of the least common multiple of the number of bytes
transformed by the specified output <br>
types. If the least common multiple is greater than 16, the
results are unspecified. Each input block shall be written
as transformed by each output type, one per written line,
<br>
in the order that the output types were specified. If the
input block size is larger than the number of bytes
transformed by the output type, the output type shall
sequentially <br>
transform the parts of the input block, and the output from
each of the transformations shall be separated by one or
more &lt;blank&gt; characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If, as a result of the
specification of the &acirc;N option or end-of-file being
reached on the last input file, input data only partially
satisfies an output type, the input shall be <br>
extended sufficiently with null bytes to write the last byte
of the input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unless &acirc;A n is specified,
the first output line produced for each input block shall be
preceded by the input offset, cumulative across input files,
of the next byte to be writ&acirc; <br>
ten. The format of the input offset is unspecified; however,
it shall not contain any &lt;blank&gt; characters, shall
start at the first character of the output line, and shall
be fol&acirc; <br>
lowed by one or more &lt;blank&gt; characters. In addition,
the offset of the byte following the last byte written shall
be written after all the input data has been processed, but
<br>
shall not be followed by any &lt;blank&gt; characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no &acirc;A option is
specified, the input offset base is unspecified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The following exit values shall be returned:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 All input files were processed
successfully.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following sections are
informative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">APPLICATION USAGE <br>
XSI-conformant applications are warned not to use filenames
starting with &rsquo;+&rsquo; or a first operand starting
with a numeric character so that the old functionality can
be maintained <br>
by implementations, unless they specify one of the &acirc;A,
&acirc;j, or &acirc;N options. To guarantee that one of
these filenames is always interpreted as a filename, an
application could <br>
always specify the address base format with the &acirc;A
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
If a file containing 128 bytes with decimal values zero to
127, in increasing order, is supplied as standard input to
the command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">od &acirc;A d &acirc;t a</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">on an implementation using an
input block size of 16 bytes, the standard output,
independent of the current locale setting, would be similar
to:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0000000 nul soh stx etx eot enq
ack bel bs ht nl vt ff cr so si <br>
0000016 dle dc1 dc2 dc3 dc4 nak syn etb can em sub esc fs gs

0000128</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that this volume of
POSIX.1&acirc;2008 allows nl or lf to be used as the name
for the ISO/IEC 646:1991 standard IRV character with decimal
value 10. The IRV names this character <br>
lf (line feed), but traditional implementations have
referred to this character as newline (nl) and the POSIX
locale character set symbolic name for the corresponding
character <br>
is a &lt;newline&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">od &acirc;A o &acirc;t o2x2x
&acirc;N 18</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">on a system with 32-bit words
and an implementation using an input block size of 16 bytes
could write 18 bytes in approximately the following
format:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0000000 032056 031440 041123

<p style="margin-top: 1em">on a system with 64-bit doubles
(for example, IEEE Std 754&acirc;1985 double precision
floating-point format) would skip 21 bytes of input data and
then write 24 bytes in approximately <br>
the following format:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0000000 1.00000000000000e+00

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RATIONALE <br>
The od utility went through several names in early
proposals, including hd, xd, and most recently hexdump.
There were several objections to all of these based on the
following <br>
reasons:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The hd and xd names conflicted
with historical utilities that behaved differently.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The hexdump description was
much more complex than needed for a simple dump utility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The od utility has been
available on all historical implementations and there was no
need to create a new name for a utility so similar to the
historical od utility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The original reasons for not
standardizing historical od were also fairly widespread.
Those reasons are given below along with rationale
explaining why the standard developers <br>
believe that this version does not suffer from the indicated
problem:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The BSD and System V versions
of od have diverged, and the intersection of features
provided by both does not meet the needs of the user
community. In fact, the System V ver&acirc; <br>
sion only provides a mechanism for dumping octal bytes and
shorts, signed and unsigned decimal shorts, hexadecimal
shorts, and ASCII characters. BSD added the ability to dump
<br>
floats, doubles, named ASCII characters, and octal, signed
decimal, unsigned decimal, and hexadecimal longs. The
version presented here provides more normalized forms for
<br>
dumping bytes, shorts, ints, and longs in octal, signed
decimal, unsigned decimal, and hexadecimal; float, double,
and long double; and named ASCII as well as current locale
<br>
characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* It would not be possible to
come up with a compatible superset of the BSD and System V
flags that met the requirements of the standard developers.
The historical default od <br>
output is the specified default output of this utility. None
of the option letters chosen for this version of od conflict
with any of the options to historical versions of <br>
od.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* On systems with different
sizes for short, int, and long, there was no way to ask for
dumps of ints, even in the BSD version. Because of the way
options are named, the name <br>
space could not be extended to solve these problems. This is
why the &acirc;t option was added (with type specifiers more
closely matched to the printf() formats used in the rest
<br>
of this volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008) and the optional field
sizes were added to the d, f, o, u, and x type specifiers.
It is also one of the reasons why the historical practice
<br>
was not mandated as a required obsolescent form of od.
(Although the old versions of od are not listed as an
obsolescent form, implementations are urged to continue to
rec&acirc; <br>
ognize the older forms for several more years.) The a, c, f,
o, and x types match the meaning of the corresponding format
characters in the historical implementations of od <br>
except for the default sizes of the fields converted. The d
format is signed in this volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008 to
match the printf() notation. (Historical versions of od used
d <br>
as a synonym for u in this version. The System V
implementation uses s for signed decimal; BSD uses i for
signed decimal and s for null-terminated strings.) Other
than d and <br>
u, all of the type specifiers match format characters in the
historical BSD version of od.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The sizes of the C-language
types char, short, int, long, float, double, and long double
are used even though it is recognized that there may be zero
or more than one com&acirc; <br>
piler for the C language on an implementation and that they
may use different sizes for some of these types. (For
example, one compiler might use 2 bytes shorts, 2 bytes <br>
ints, and 4 bytes longs, while another compiler (or an
option to the same compiler) uses 2 bytes shorts, 4 bytes
ints, and 4 bytes longs.) Nonetheless, there has to be a
<br>
basic size known by the implementation for these types,
corresponding to the values reported by invocations of the
getconf utility when called with system_var operands <br>
{UCHAR_MAX}, {USHORT_MAX}, {UINT_MAX}, and {ULONG_MAX} for
the types char, short, int, and long, respectively. There
are similar constants required by the ISO C standard, but
<br>
not required by the System Interfaces volume of
POSIX.1&acirc;2008 or this volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008.
They are {FLT_MANT_DIG}, {DBL_MANT_DIG}, and {LDBL_MANT_DIG}
for the types float, <br>
double, and long double, respectively. If the optional c99
utility is provided by the implementation and used as
specified by this volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008, these are
the sizes <br>
that would be provided. If an option is used that specifies
different sizes for these types, there is no guarantee that
the od utility is able to interpret binary data output <br>
by such a program correctly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This volume of
POSIX.1&acirc;2008 requires that the numeric values of these
lengths be recognized by the od utility and that symbolic
forms also be recognized. Thus, a conforming <br>
application can always look at an array of unsigned long
data elements using od &acirc;t uL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The method of specifying the
format for the address field based on specifying a starting
offset in a file unnecessarily tied the two together. The
&acirc;A option now specifies the <br>
address base and the &acirc;S option specifies a starting
offset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* It would be difficult to break
the dependence on US ASCII to achieve an internationalized
utility. It does not seem to be any harder for od to dump
characters in the current <br>
locale than it is for the ed or sed l commands. The c type
specifier does this without difficulty and is completely
compatible with the historical implementations of the c <br>
format character when the current locale uses a superset of
the ISO/IEC 646:1991 standard as a codeset. The a type
specifier (from the BSD a format character) was left as a
<br>
portable means to dump ASCII (or more correctly ISO/IEC
646:1991 standard (IRV)) so that headers produced by pax
could be deciphered even on systems that do not use the <br>
ISO/IEC 646:1991 standard as a subset of their base
codeset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The use of &quot;**&quot; as an
indication of continuation of a multi-byte character in c
specifier output was chosen based on seeing an
implementation that uses this method. The continua&acirc;
<br>
tion bytes have to be marked in a way that is not ambiguous
with another single-byte or multi-byte character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An early proposal used &acirc;S
and &acirc;n, respectively, for the &acirc;j and &acirc;N
options eventually selected. These were changed to avoid
conflicts with historical implementations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The original standard specified
&acirc;t o2 as the default when no output type was given.
This was changed to &acirc;t oS (the length of a short) to
accommodate a supercomputer implementa&acirc; <br>
tion that historically used 64 bits as its default (and that
defined shorts as 64 bits). This change should not affect
conforming applications. The requirement to support lengths
<br>
of 1, 2, and 4 was added at the same time to address an
historical implementation that had no two-byte data types in
its C compiler.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The use of a basic integer data
type is intended to allow the implementation to choose a
word size commonly used by applications on that
architecture.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Earlier versions of this
standard allowed for implementations with bytes other than
eight bits, but this has been modified in this version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FUTURE DIRECTIONS <br>
All option and operand interfaces marked XSI may be removed
in a future version.</p>
