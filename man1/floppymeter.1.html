This manpage has been automatically generated from fdutils's texinfo
  documentation. However, this process is only approximative, and some items,
  such as cross-references, footnotes and indices are lost in this translation
  process. Indeed, these items have no appropriate representation in the manpage
  format. Moreover, only the items specific to each command have been
  translated, and the general information about fdutils has been dropped in the
  manpage version. Thus I strongly advise you to use the original texinfo doc.

The texinfo doc looks most pretty when printed or as HTML. Indeed, in the info
  version certain examples are difficult to read due to the quoting conventions
  used in info.

The floppymeter program measures characteristic parameters of a floppy drive and
  floppy controller, such as the rotation speed of the drive, the data transfer
  rate of the controller, and the resulting raw capacity of a disk track. To use
  this program, insert a disposable floppy in the drive, and type floppymeter --
  <i>density</i>, where density describes the density of the disk used for the
  test. (Should be one of dd, hd or ed). <b>CAUTION: the data on the</b> <b>disk
  will be erased</b>. This program should be used to verify whether the drive
  and controller are out of tolerance if you experience problems with some high
  capacity formats. It only needs to be run once per drive: although a disk is
  needed to perform the measurements, the measured data only depend on the drive
  and the controller, and not on the disk.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To measure the raw capacity of the disk track, the floppymeter program formats
  the first track of the drive in a special way that allows it to read the raw
  data (gaps and headers) of the disk. <b>Thus, all data</b> <b>previously
  stored on that disk is lost</b>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The rotation speed is measured by timing the return time of a readid command. In
  order to gain more precision, the command is issued many times in a row.
  During this phase, the number of rotations since the start of the test, the
  average time per rotation since the start, and a sliding average of the times
  of the last 30 rotations is printed, and updated continuously.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The data transfer rate is deduced from the two parameters above.
<div class="Pp"></div>
At the end of the program, all parameters (raw capacity, duration of one
  rotation, and data transfer rate) are printed again, as well as their relative
  deviation to the standard value. Finally, it suggests a capacity deviation
  description line, which can be directly pasted into the drive definition file
  (See section Drive descriptions.).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Usually, the data transfer rate should not deviate more than 150 ppm from the
  expected value, and the rotation speed of the drive should not deviate more
  than 3000 ppm from the expected value. If these deviations are bigger, you may
  get problems with certain high capacity formats.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the raw capacity of the drive is too small, some high capacity formats may
  become unformattable on this drive/controller combo.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If on the other hand, the raw capacity of the drive is too big, you may get
  problems when writing to a disk formatted by this drive on another drive with
  a smaller raw capacity. In order to avoid this, increase superformats gap
  parameter (-G).

This program is quite new, and may have bugs. Here are a few suggested tests to
  check its sanity:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">* &#x00A0;&#x00A0;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The deviation of the data transfer rate solely depends on
      the controller. It should not be different between two drives connected to
      the same controller. However, the drive rotation speed may be different
      for different drives.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">* &#x00A0;&#x00A0;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">All data transfer rates (for double, high and extra
      density) are derived from a same master frequency. Thus the
      <i>deviation</i> of the data transfer rate should be independent of the
      density used.</dd>
