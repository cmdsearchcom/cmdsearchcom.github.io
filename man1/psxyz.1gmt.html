<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: No space is allowed
between the option flag and the associated arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
psxyz reads (x,y,z) triplets from files [or standard input]
and generates PostScript code that will plot lines,
polygons, or symbols at those locations in 3-D. If a symbol
is <br>
selected and no symbol size given, then psxyz will interpret
the fourth column of the input data as symbol size. Symbols
whose size is &lt;= 0 are skipped. If no symbols are
speci&acirc; <br>
fied then the symbol code (see -S below) must be present as
last column in the input. If -S is not used, a line
connecting the data points will be drawn instead. To
explicitly <br>
close polygons, use -L. Select a fill with -G. If -G is set,
-W will control whether the polygon outline is drawn or not.
If a symbol is selected, -G and -W determines the fill <br>
and outline/no outline, respectively. The PostScript code is
written to standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REQUIRED ARGUMENTS <br>
-Jparameters (more ...) <br>
Select map projection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Jz|Zparameters (more ...) <br>
Set z-axis scaling; same syntax as -Jx.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R[unit]xmin/xmax/ymin/ymax[r]
(more ...) <br>
Specify the region of interest.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For perspective view p,
optionally append /zmin/zmax. (more ...)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS <br>
table One or more ASCII (or binary, see -bi[ncols][type])
data table file(s) holding a number of data columns. If no
tables are given then we read from standard input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B[p|s]parameters (more ...)
<br>
Set map boundary intervals.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Ccpt Give a CPT or specify
-Ccolor1,color2[,color3,...] to build a linear continuous
CPT from those colors automatically. In this case colorn can
be a r/g/b triplet, a color <br>
name, or an HTML hexadecimal color (e.g. #aabbcc ). If -S is
set, let symbol fill color be determined by the t-value in
the fourth column. Additional fields are shifted <br>
over by one column (optional size would be in 5th rather
than 4th field, etc.). If -S is not set, then psxyz expects
the user to supply a multisegment file (where each <br>
segment header contains a -Zval string. The val will control
the color of the line or polygon (if -L is set) via the
CPT.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Ddx/dy[/dz] <br>
Offset the plot symbol or line locations by the given
amounts dx/dy[dz] [Default is no offset].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Gfill Select color or pattern
for filling of symbols or polygons [Default is no fill].
Note that psxyz will search for -G and -W strings in all the
segment headers and let any <br>
values thus found over-ride the command line settings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Iintens <br>
Use the supplied intens value (nominally in the -1 to + 1
range) to modulate the fill color by simulating illumination
[none].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-K (more ...) <br>
Do not finalize the PostScript plot.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L[+b|d|D][+xl|r|x0][+yl|r|y0][+ppen]
<br>
Force closed polygons. Alternatively, append modifiers to
build a polygon from a line segment. Append +d to build
symmetrical envelope around y(x) using deviations dy(x) <br>
given in extra column 4. Append +D to build asymmetrical
envelope around y(x) using deviations dy1(x) and dy2(x) from
extra columns 4-5. Append +b to build asymmetrical <br>
envelope around y(x) using bounds yl(x) and yh(x) from extra
columns 4-5. Append +xl|r|x0 to connect first and last point
to anchor points at either xmin, xmax, or x0, or <br>
append +yb|t|y0 to connect first and last point to anchor
points at either ymin, ymax, or y0. Polygon may be painted
(-G) and optionally outlined by adding +ppen [no out&acirc;
<br>
line]. All constructed polygons are assumed to have a
constant z value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N[c|r] <br>
Do NOT clip symbols that fall outside map border [Default
plots points whose coordinates are strictly inside the map
border only]. The option does not apply to lines and <br>
polygons which are always clipped to the map region. For
periodic (360-longitude) maps we must plot all symbols twice
in case they are clipped by the repeating boundary. <br>
The -N will turn off clipping and not plot repeating
symbols. Use -Nr to turn off clipping but retain the
plotting of such repeating symbols, or use -Nc to retain
clip&acirc; <br>
ping but turn off plotting of repeating symbols.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O (more ...) <br>
Append to existing PostScript plot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P (more ...) <br>
Select &quot;Portrait&quot; plot orientation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Q Turn off the automatic
sorting of items based on their distance from the viewer.
The default is to sort the items so that items in the
foreground are plotted after items <br>
in the background.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S[symbol][size[u]][/size_y]
<br>
Plot symbols. If present, size is symbol size in the unit
set in gmt.conf (unless c, i, or p is appended). If the
symbol code (see below) is not given it will be read from
<br>
the last column in the input data; this cannot be used in
conjunction with binary input. Optionally, append c, i, or p
to indicate that the size information in the input <br>
data is in units of cm, inch, or point, respectively
[Default is PROJ_LENGTH_UNIT]. Note: if you give both size
and symbol via the input file you must use PROJ_LENGTH_UNIT
<br>
to indicate the units used for the symbol size or append the
units to the size in the file. Some 2-dimensional symbols
optionally take a second size via size_y. If sym&acirc; <br>
bol sizes are expected via the fourth data column then you
may convert those values to suitable symbol sizes via the -i
mechanism.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The uppercase symbols A, C, D,
G, H, I, N, S, T are normalized to have the same area as a
circle with diameter size, while the size of the
corresponding lowercase symbols <br>
refers to the diameter of a circumscribed circle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can change symbols by adding
the required -S option to any of your multisegment
headers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Choose between these symbol
codes:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S- x-dash (-). size is the
length of a short horizontal (x-dir) line segment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S+ plus (+). size is diameter
of circumscribing circle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Sa star. size is diameter of
circumscribing circle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Sb Vertical bar extending from
base to y. size is bar width. Append u if size is in x-units
[Default is plot-distance units]. By default, base = ymin.
Append b[base] <br>
to change this value. If base is not appended then we read
it from the last input data column.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-SB Horizontal bar extending
from base to x. size is bar width. Append u if size is in
y-units [Default is plot-distance units]. By default, base =
xmin. Append <br>
b[base] to change this value. If base is not appended then
we read it from the last input data column.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Sc circle. size is diameter of
circle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Sd diamond. size is diameter of
circumscribing circle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Se ellipse. Direction (in
degrees counter-clockwise from horizontal), major_axis, and
minor_axis must be found in columns 4, 5, and 6.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-SE Same as -Se, except azimuth
(in degrees east of north) should be given instead of
direction. The azimuth will be mapped into an angle based on
the chosen map pro&acirc; <br>
jection (-Se leaves the directions unchanged.) Furthermore,
the axes lengths must be given in geographical instead of
plot-distance units. An exception occurs for a <br>
linear projection in which we assume the ellipse axes are
given in the same units as -R. For degenerate ellipses
(circles) with just the diameter given, use -SE-. <br>
The diameter is excepted to be given in column 4.
Alternatively, append the desired diameter to -SE- and this
fixed diameter is used instead. For allowable geo&acirc;
<br>
graphical units, see UNITS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Sf front.
-Sfgap[/size][+l|+r][+b+c+f+s+t][+ooffset][+p[pen]]. Supply
distance gap between symbols and symbol size. If gap is
negative, it is interpreted to mean the <br>
number of symbols along the front instead. If size is
missing it is set to 30% of the gap, except when gap is
negative and size is thus required. Append +l or +r <br>
to plot symbols on the left or right side of the front
[Default is centered]. Append +type to specify which symbol
to plot: box, circle, fault, slip, or triangle. <br>
[Default is fault]. Slip means left-lateral or right-lateral
strike-slip arrows (centered is not an option). The +s
modifier optionally accepts the angle used to <br>
draw the vector [30]. Append +ooffset to offset the first
symbol from the beginning of the front by that amount [0].
The chosen symbol is drawn with the same pen <br>
as set for the line (i.e., via -W). The use an alternate
pen, append +ppen. To skip the outline, just use +p. Note:
By placing -Sf options in the segment header <br>
you can change the front types on a segment-by-segment
basis.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Sg octagon. size is diameter of
circumscribing circle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Sh hexagon. size is diameter of
circumscribing circle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Si inverted triangle. size is
diameter of circumscribing circle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Sj Rotated rectangle. Direction
(in degrees counter-clockwise from horizontal), x-dimension,
and y-dimension must be found in columns 4, 5, and 6.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-SJ Same as -Sj, except azimuth
(in degrees east of north) should be given instead of
direction. The azimuth will be mapped into an angle based on
the chosen map pro&acirc; <br>
jection (-Sj leaves the directions unchanged.) Furthermore,
the dimensions must be given in geographical instead of
plot-distance units. For a degenerate rectangle <br>
(square) with one dimension given, use -SJ-. The dimension
is excepted to be given in column 4. Alternatively, append
the dimension diameter to -SJ- and this <br>
fixed dimension is used instead. An exception occurs for a
linear projection in which we assume the dimensions are
given in the same units as -R. For allowable <br>
geographical units, see UNITS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Sk kustom symbol. Append
&lt;name&gt;/size, and we will look for a definition file
called &lt;name&gt;.def in (1) the current directory or (2)
in ~/.gmt or (3) in <br>
$GMT_SHAREDIR/custom. The symbol as defined in that file is
of size 1.0 by default; the appended size will scale symbol
accordingly. The symbols are plotted in the <br>
x-y plane. Users may add their own custom *.def files; see
CUSTOM SYMBOLS below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Sl letter or text string (less
than 64 characters). Give size, and append /string after the
size. Note that the size is only approximate; no individual
scaling is done <br>
for different characters. Remember to escape special
characters like *. Optionally, you may append %font to
select a particular font [Default is FONT_ANNOT_PRI&acirc;
<br>
MARY].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Sm math angle arc, optionally
with one or two arrow heads [Default is no arrow heads]. The
size is the length of the vector head. Arc width is set by
-W. The radius of <br>
the arc and its start and stop directions (in degrees
counter-clockwise from horizontal) must be given in columns
4-6. See VECTOR ATTRIBUTES for specifying <br>
attributes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-SM Same as -Sm but switches to
straight angle symbol if angles subtend 90 degrees
exactly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Sn pentagon. size is diameter
of circumscribing circle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-So column (3-D) extending from
base to z. The size sets base width (Use xsize/ysize if not
the same). Append u if size is in x-units [Default is
plot-distance <br>
units]. If no size is given we expect both xsize and ysize
as two extra data columns. By default, base = 0. Append
bbase to change this value. The facet colors <br>
will be modified to simulate shading. Use -SO to disable
such 3-D illumination. If base is not appended then we read
it from the last input data column.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Sp point. No size needs to be
specified (1 pixel is used).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Sq quoted line, i.e., lines
with annotations such as contours. It is assumed that each
individual line has a constant z level (i.e., each line must
lie in the x-y <br>
plane). Append [d|D|f|l|L|n|x|X]info[:labelinfo]. The
required argument controls the placement of labels along the
quoted lines. Choose among five controlling <br>
algorithms: <br>
ddist[c|i|p] or Ddist[d|e|f|k|m|M|n|s] For lower case d,
give distances between labels on the plot in your preferred
measurement unit c (cm), i (inch), or p <br>
(points), while for upper case D, specify distances in map
units and append the unit; choose among e (m), f (foot), k
(km), M (mile), n (nautical mile) or u (US <br>
survey foot), and d (arc degree), m (arc minute), or s (arc
second). [Default is 10c or 4i]. As an option, you can
append /fraction which is used to place the <br>
very first label for each contour when the cumulative
along-contour distance equals fraction * dist [0.25].
fffile.d Reads the ASCII file ffile.d and places <br>
labels at locations in the file that matches locations along
the quoted lines. Inexact matches and points outside the
region are skipped. l|Lline1[,*line2*,...] <br>
Give start and stop coordinates for one or more
comma-separated straight line segments. Labels will be
placed where these lines intersect the quoted lines. The
<br>
format of each line specification is start/stop, where start
and stop are either a specified point lon/lat or a
2-character XY key that uses the justification <br>
format employed in pstext to indicate a point on the map,
given as [LCR][BMT]. L will interpret the point pairs as
defining great circles [Default is straight <br>
line]. nn_label Specifies the number of equidistant labels
for quoted lines line [1]. Upper case N starts labeling
exactly at the start of the line [Default <br>
centers them along the line]. N-1 places one justified label
at start, while N+1 places one justified label at the end of
quoted lines. Optionally, append <br>
/min_dist[c|i|p] to enforce that a minimum distance
separation between successive labels is enforced. x|Xxfile.d
Reads the multisegment file xfile.d and places <br>
labels at the intersections between the quoted lines and the
lines in xfile.d. X will resample the lines first along
great-circle arcs. In addition, you may <br>
optionally append +rradius[c|i|p] to set a minimum label
separation in the x-y plane [no limitation].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The optional labelinfo controls
the specifics of the label formatting and consists of a
concatenated string made up of any of the following control
arguments:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+aangle <br>
For annotations at a fixed angle, +an for line-normal, or
+ap for line-parallel [Default].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+cdx[/dy] <br>
Sets the clearance between label and optional text box.
Append c|i|p to specify the unit or % to indicate a
percentage of the label font size [15%].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+d Turns on debug which will
draw helper points and lines to illustrate the workings of
the quoted line setup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+e Delay the plotting of the
text. This is used to build a clip path based on the text,
then lay down other overlays while that clip path is in
effect, then <br>
turning of clipping with psclip -Cs which finally plots the
original text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+ffont Sets the desired font
[Default FONT_ANNOT_PRIMARY with its size changed to
9p].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+g[color] <br>
Selects opaque text boxes [Default is transparent];
optionally specify the color [Default is PS_PAGE_COLOR].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+jjust Sets label justification
[Default is MC]. Ignored when -SqN|n+|-1 is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+llabel <br>
Sets the constant label text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+Lflag Sets the label text
according to the specified flag:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+Lh Take the label from the
current segment header (first scan for an embedded -Llabel
option, if not use the first word following the segment
flag). For <br>
multiple-word labels, enclose entire label in double quotes.
+Ld Take the Cartesian plot distances along the line as the
label; append c|i|p as the unit <br>
[Default is PROJ_LENGTH_UNIT]. +LD Calculate actual map
distances; append d|e|f|k|n|M|n|s as the unit [Default is
d(egrees), unless label placement was <br>
based on map distances along the lines in which case we use
the same unit specified for that algorithm]. Requires a map
projection to be used. +Lf Use <br>
text after the 2nd column in the fixed label location file
as the label. Requires the fixed label location setting. +Lx
As +Lh but use the headers in the <br>
xfile.d instead. Requires the crossing file option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+ndx[/dy] <br>
Nudges the placement of labels by the specified amount
(append c|i|p to specify the units). Increments are
considered in the coordinate system defined by <br>
the orientation of the line; use +N to force increments in
the plot x/y coordinates system [no nudging]. Not allowed
with +v.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+o Selects rounded rectangular
text box [Default is rectangular]. Not applicable for curved
text (+v) and only makes sense for opaque text boxes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+p[pen] <br>
Draws the outline of text boxes [Default is no outline];
optionally specify pen for outline [Default is width =
0.25p, color = black, style = solid].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+rmin_rad <br>
Will not place labels where the line&rsquo;s radius of
curvature is less than min_rad [Default is 0].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+t[file] <br>
Saves line label x, y, and text to file [Line_labels.txt].
Use +T to save x, y, angle, text instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+uunit Appends unit to all line
labels. If unit starts with a leading hyphen (-) then there
will be no space between label value and the unit. [Default
is no <br>
unit].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+v Specifies curved labels
following the path [Default is straight labels].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+w Specifies how many (x,y)
points will be used to estimate label angles [Default is
10].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+=prefix <br>
Prepends prefix to all line labels. If prefix starts with a
leading hyphen (-) then there will be no space between label
value and the prefix. [Default is <br>
no prefix].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: By placing -Sq options in
the segment header you can change the quoted text attributes
on a segment-by-segment basis.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Sr rectangle. No size needs to
be specified, but the x- and y-dimensions must be found in
columns 4 and 5.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-SR Rounded rectangle. No size
needs to be specified, but the x- and y-dimensions and
corner radius must be found in columns 4, 5, and 6.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Ss square. size is diameter of
circumscribing circle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-St triangle. size is diameter
of circumscribing circle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Su cube (3-D). The size) sets
length of all sides. Append u if size is in x-units [Default
is plot-distance units]. The facet colors will be modified
to simulate <br>
shading. Use -SU to disable such 3-D illumination.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Sv vector. Direction (in
degrees counter-clockwise from horizontal) and length must
be found in columns 4 and 5. The size is the length of the
vector head. Vector <br>
width is set by -W. See VECTOR ATTRIBUTES for specifying
attributes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-SV Same as -Sv, except azimuth
(in degrees east of north) should be given instead of
direction. The azimuth will be mapped into an angle based on
the chosen map pro&acirc; <br>
jection (-Sv leaves the directions unchanged.) See VECTOR
ATTRIBUTES for specifying attributes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Sw pie wedge. Start and stop
directions (in degrees counter-clockwise from horizontal)
for pie slice must be found in columns 4 and 5. Append +a to
just draw the arc <br>
line or +r to just draw the radial lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-SW Same as -Sw, except azimuths
(in degrees east of north) should be given instead of the
two directions. The azimuths will be mapped into angles
based on the chosen <br>
map projection (-Sw leaves the directions unchanged.) For
geo-wedges, specify size as a radial distance and append a
length unit from d|m|s|e|f|k|M|n|u. Append +a <br>
to just draw the arc or +r to just draw the radial
lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Sx cross (x). size is diameter
of circumscribing circle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Sy y-dash (|). size is the
length of a short horizontal (y-dir) line segment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S= geovector. Azimuth (in
degrees east from north) and length (in km) must be found in
columns 4 and 5. The size is the length of the vector head.
Vector width is set <br>
by -W. See VECTOR ATTRIBUTES for specifying attributes.
Note: Geovector stems are drawn as thin filled polygons and
hence pen attributes like dashed and dotted are <br>
not available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S~ decorated line, i.e., lines
with symbols along them. Append
[d|D|f|l|L|n|N|s|S|x|X]info[:symbolinfo]. The required
argument controls the placement of symbols along <br>
the decorated lines. Choose among six controlling
algorithms:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ddist[c|i|p] or
Ddist[d|e|f|k|m|M|n|s] <br>
For lower case d, give distances between symbols on the plot
in your preferred measurement unit c (cm), i (inch), or p
(points), while for upper case D, <br>
specify distances in map units and append the unit; choose
among e (m), f (foot), k (km), M (mile), n (nautical mile)
or u (US survey foot), and d (arc <br>
degree), m (arc minute), or s (arc second). [Default is 10c
or 4i]. As an option, you can append /fraction which is used
to place the very first symbol <br>
for each line when the cumulative along-line distance equals
fraction * dist [0.25].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fffile.d <br>
Reads the ASCII file ffile.d and places symbols at locations
in the file that matches locations along the decorated
lines. Inexact matches and points out&acirc; <br>
side the region are skipped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">l|Lline1[,line2,...] <br>
Give the coordinates of the end points for one or more
comma-separated straight line segments. Symbols will be
placed where these lines intersect the <br>
decorated lines. The format of each line specification is
start_lon/start_lat/stop_lon/stop_lat. Both
start_lon/start_lat and stop_lon/stop_lat can be <br>
replaced by a 2-character key that uses the justification
format employed in pstext to indicate a point on the frame
or center of the map, given as <br>
[LCR][BMT]. L will interpret the point pairs as defining
great circles [Default is straight line].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">n|Nn_symbol <br>
Specifies the number of equidistant symbols for decorated
lines [1]. Upper case N starts placing symbols exactly at
the start of the line [Default centers <br>
them along the line]. N-1 places one symbol at start, while
N+1 places one symbol at the end of decorated lines.
Optionally, append /min_dist[c|i|p] to <br>
enforce that a minimum distance separation between
successive symbols is enforced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">s|Sn_symbol <br>
Same as n|Nn_symbol but implies that the input data are
first to be converted into a series of 2-point line segments
before plotting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">x|Xxfile.d <br>
Reads the multisegment file xfile.d and places symbols at
the intersections between the decorated lines and the lines
in xfile.d. X will resample the <br>
lines first along great-circle arcs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The optional symbolinfo controls
the specifics of the symbol selection and formatting and
consists of a concatenated string made up of any of the
following con&acirc; <br>
trol arguments:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+aangle <br>
For symbols at a fixed angle, +an for line-normal, or +ap
for line-parallel [Default].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+d Turns on debug which will
draw helper points and lines to illustrate the workings of
the decorated line setup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+g[fill] <br>
Sets the symbol fill [no fill].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+ndx[/dy] <br>
Nudges the placement of symbols by the specified amount
(append c|i|p to specify the units). Increments are
considered in the coordinate system defined by <br>
the orientation of the line; use +N to force increments in
the plot x/y coordinates system [no nudging].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+p[pen] <br>
Draws the outline of symbols [Default is no outline];
optionally specify pen for outline [Default is width =
0.25p, color = black, style = solid].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+w Specifies how many (x,y)
points will be used to estimate symbol angles [Default is
10].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: By placing -S~ options in
the segment header you can change the decorated lines on a
segment-by-segment basis.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T Ignore all input files,
including standard input. This is the same as specifying
/dev/null (or NUL for Windows users) as input file. Use this
to activate only the options <br>
that are not related to plotting of lines or symbols, such
as psxyz -R -J -O -T to terminate a sequence of GMT plotting
commands without producing any plotting output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U[just/dx/dy/][c|label] (more
...) <br>
Draw GMT time stamp logo on plot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V[level] (more ...) <br>
Select verbosity level [c].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-W[pen][attr] (more ...) <br>
Set pen attributes for lines or the outline of symbols
[Defaults: width = default, color = black, style = solid].
If the modifier +cl is appended then the color of the <br>
line are taken from the CPT (see -C). If instead modifier
+cf is appended then the color from the cpt file is applied
to symbol fill. Use just +c for both effects.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X[a|c|f|r][x-shift[u]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Y[a|c|f|r][y-shift[u]] (more

Specify number of plot copies [Default is 1].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dinodata (more ...) <br>
Replace input columns that equal nodata with NaN.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f[i|o]colinfo (more ...) <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t[transp] (more ...) <br>
Set PDF transparency level in percent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-:[i|o] (more ...) <br>
Swap 1st and 2nd column on input and/or output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-^ or just - <br>

explanation of any module-specific option (but not the GMT
common options), then exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-? or no arguments <br>
Print a complete usage (help) message, including the
explanation of options, then exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UNITS <br>
For map distance unit, append unit d for arc degree, m for
arc minute, and s for arc second, or e for meter [Default],
f for foot, k for km, M for statute mile, n for nautical
<br>
mile, and u for US survey foot. By default we compute such
distances using a spherical approximation with great
circles. Prepend - to a distance (or the unit is no distance
is <br>
given) to perform &quot;Flat Earth&quot; calculations
(quicker but less accurate) or prepend + to perform exact
geodesic calculations (slower but more accurate).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VECTOR ATTRIBUTES <br>
Several modifiers may be appended to the vector-producing
options to specify the placement of vector heads, their
shapes, and the justification of the vector. Below, left and
<br>
right refers to the side of the vector line when viewed from
the start point to the end point of the segment: <br>
+aangle sets the angle of the vector head apex [30].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+b places a vector head at the
beginning of the vector path [none]. Optionally, append t
for a terminal line, c for a circle, a for arrow [Default],
i for tail, A for plain <br>
arrow, and I for plain tail. Further append l|r to only draw
the left or right side of this head [both sides].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+e places a vector head at the
end of the vector path [none]. Optionally, append t for a
terminal line, c for a circle, a for arrow [Default], i for
tail, A for plain arrow, <br>
and I for plain tail. Further append l|r to only draw the
left or right side of this head [both sides].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+g-|fill turns off vector head
fill (if -) or sets the vector head fill [Default fill is
used, which may be no fill].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+l draws half-arrows, using only
the left side of specified heads [both sides].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+m places a vector head at the
mid-point the vector path [none]. Append f or r for forward
or reverse direction of the vector [forward]. Optionally,
append t for a terminal <br>
line, c for a circle, or a for arrow head [Default]. Further
append l|r to only draw the left or right side of this head
[both sides]. Cannot be combined with +b or +e.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+nnorm scales down vector
attributes (pen thickness, head size) with decreasing
length, where vectors shorter than norm will have their
attributes scaled by length/norm [arrow <br>
attributes remains invariant to length].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+oplon/plat specifies the
oblique pole for the great or small circles. Only needed for
great circles if +q is given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+p[-][pen] sets the vector pen
attributes. If pen has a leading - then the head outline is
not drawn. [Default pen is used, and head outline is
drawn]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+q means the input angle, length
data instead represent the start and stop opening angles of
the arc segment relative to the given point.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+r draws half-arrows, using only
the right side of specified heads [both sides].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">t[b|e]trim will shift the
beginning or end point (or both) along the vector segment by
the given trim; append suitable unit. If the modifiers b|e
are not used then trim may be <br>
two values separated by a slash, which is used to specify
different trims for the two ends. Positive trims will
shorted the vector while negative trims will lengthen it [no
<br>
trim].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition, all but circular
vectors may take these modifiers: <br>
+jjust determines how the input x,y point relates to the
vector. Choose from beginning [default], end, or center.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+s means the input angle, length
are instead the x, y coordinates of the vector end
point.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, Cartesian vectors may
take these modifiers: <br>
+zscale[unit] expects input dx,dy vector components and uses
the scale to convert to polar coordinates with length in
given unit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
To plot blue columns (width = 1.25 cm) at the positions
listed in the file heights.xyz on a 3-D projection of the
space (0-10), (0-10), (0-100), with tickmarks every 2, 2,
and <br>
10, viewing it from the southeast at 30 degree elevation,
use:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gmt psxyz heights.xyz
-R0/10/0/10/0/100 -Jx1.25c -Jz0.125c -So1.25c -Gblue

PLOT&quot; -p135/30 -Uc -W -P &gt; heights.ps</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEGMENT HEADER PARSING <br>
Segment header records may contain one of more of the
following options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Gfill Use the new fill and turn
filling on</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-G- Turn filling off</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-G Revert to default fill (none
if not set on command line)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wpen Use the new pen and turn
outline on</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-W Revert to default pen
MAP_DEFAULT_PEN (if not set on command line)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-W- Turn outline off</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Zzval Obtain fill via cpt
lookup using z-value zval</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ZNaN Get the NaN color from the
CPT</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CUSTOM SYMBOLS <br>
psxyz allows users to define and plot their own custom
symbols. This is done by encoding the symbol using our
custom symbol macro code described in Appendix N. Put all
the macro <br>
codes for your new symbol in a file whose extension must be
.def; you may then address the symbol without giving the
extension (e.g., the symbol file tsunami.def is used by
spec&acirc; <br>
ifying -Sktsunami/size. The definition file can contain any
number of plot code records, as well as blank lines and
comment lines (starting with #). psxyz will look for the
defi&acirc; <br>
nition files in (1) the current directory, (2) the ~/.gmt
directory, and (3) the $GMT_SHAREDIR/custom directory, in
that order. Freeform polygons (made up of straight line
seg&acirc; <br>
ments and arcs of circles) can be designed - these polygons
can be painted and filled with a pattern. Other standard
geometric symbols can also be used. See Appendix
App-cus&acirc; <br>
tom_symbols for macro definitions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
No hidden line removal is employed for polygons and lines.
Symbols, however, are first sorted according to their
distance from the viewpoint so that nearby symbols will
overprint <br>
more distant ones should they project to the same x,y
position.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">psxyz cannot handle filling of
polygons that contain the south or north pole. For such a
polygon, make a copy and split it into two and make each
explicitly contain the polar <br>
point. The two polygons will combine to give the desired
effect when filled; to draw outline use the original
polygon.</p>
