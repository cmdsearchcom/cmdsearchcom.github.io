<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
tkgate - Tcl/Tk based digital circuit editor and
simulator</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
tkgate [-xqs] [-X script] [-l file] [-p file] [-P printer]
[files...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
TkGate is a graphical editor and event driven simulator for
digital circuits with a tcl/tk-based interface. Supported
circuit elements include basic gates (AND, OR, etc.), tri-
<br>
state gates, adders, multipliers, registers, memories and
mos transistors. Hierarchical design is also supported with
support for user defined modules. Save files are based on
<br>
the Verilog netlist format.</p>

found at:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">http://www.tkgate.org</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The options are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X script Automaticaly start the
simulator and execute the specified simulation script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p file Print circuit to file
without starting GUI.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P printer Print circuit to
printer without starting GUI.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l file Read the specified file
as a library.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x Automaticaly start the
simulator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Suppress startup
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Excute with a synchronous X
server connection. This option is primarily for
debugging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L lang Specify a locality to
use if tkgate has been configued for Japanese support. The
locality should be either &quot;ASCII&quot; for English, or
&quot;ja_JP.EUC&quot; for Japanese. This <br>
option can also be set via the LANG environment
variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY &amp; CREDITS <br>
TkGate begin life as an undergraduate project at Carnegie
Mellon University (CMU) in 1987. At that time it was called
simply &rsquo;gate&rsquo; and ran under the &rsquo;wm&rsquo;
window manager, a win&acirc; <br>
dowing system developed at CMU before X11 was widely used.
In this incarnation it was used by students in the computer
architecture course at CMU to develop a simple
micropro&acirc; <br>
cessor (dubbed &quot;The Bat Computer&quot;). After laying
dormant for several years, it was resurrected in 1991 and
ported to run under X11 with the Xlib API. In this
incarnation it was <br>
used several times by students in the introductory digital
logic course, but after the author graduated and left CMU,
it went into hibernation again. This Tcl/Tk incarnation was
<br>
begun in 1998. While there is certainly some cruftyness in
the implementation in places due to the multiple
reincarnations, many new features have been added since the
older wm <br>
and X11 versions, and the interface has been made much
easier to use.</p>
