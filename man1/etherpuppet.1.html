<p>ETHERPUPPET(1) BSD General Commands Manual
ETHERPUPPET(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
etherpuppet &acirc; create a virtual interface from a remote
Ethernet interface</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
etherpuppet [-s port] [-c target:port] [-B] [-S] [-M filter]
[-C] [-i iface] <br>
etherpuppet [-m] [-s port] [-c target:port] [-I iface]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
etherpuppet is a small program that will create a virtual
interface (TUN/TAP) on one machine from the ethernet
interface of another machine through a TCP connection.
Everything <br>
seen by the real interface will be seen by the virtual one.
Everything sent to the virtual interface will be emitted by
the real one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It has been designed because one
often has a small machine as his Internet gateway, and
sometimes want to run some big applications that need raw
access to this interface, for <br>
sniffing (Ethereal, etc.) or for crafting packets that do
not survive being reassembled, NATed, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When launched with the first
syntax, etherpuppet is a slave that will send to its master
everything that passes on the given interface. With the
second syntax, etherpuppet is the <br>
master and will create the special TAP device (whose default
name starts with puppet. In both modes, etherpuppet is able
to either connect or listen to its slave/master.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Traffic seen by the real
interface is sent through the TCP connection to the doll
interface. Thus, it is important that this connection is not
seen by the real interface (or else, <br>
we&rsquo;ll have a cute infinite traffic loop).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The options are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s port <br>
Listen on the given TCP port.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c ip:port <br>
Connect to the slave/master on the given IP/port.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i iface <br>
Vampirize the given interface name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I ifname <br>
Choose the name of the virtual interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m Master mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B Do not use BPF. With this
option, etherpuppet may see its own traffic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S Build BPF with the content of
SSH_CONNECTION environment variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M src:sp,dst:dp <br>
Build manually a BPF filter that will exclude matching
traffic in both directions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C Do not copy real interface
parameters to virtual interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The source and destination are
by default the TCP connection end points. If you go through
SSH tunneling, you can use the -S option to use
SSH_CONNECTION environment variable con&acirc; <br>
tent instead, so that you will filter out the SSH connection
of your current session and not the connection to the local
SSH tunnel end point (which is pointless). If this still
<br>
not fit your needs, you can manually specify the connection
end points with -M.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you connect two Etherpuppet
instances in master mode, you&rsquo;ll get a TCP tunnel
through virtual interfaces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you connect two Etherpuppet
instances in slave mode, you may get some kind of
inefficient distributed bridge, but more probably,
you&rsquo;ll get a big mess.</p>
