This program is part of <b>Netpbm</b>(1)
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>pambackground</b> reads a PNM or PAM image as input. It generates as output a
  PAM image that identifies the background area of the image (a mask).
<div class="Pp"></div>
To identify the background, <b>pambackground</b> assumes the image is a
  foreground image, smaller than the total image size, placed over a
  single-color background. It assumes that foreground image is solid -- it does
  not have holes through which the background can be seen. So in specific,
  <b>pambackground</b> first identifies the background color, then finds all
  contiguous pixels of that color in regions touching any edge of the image.
  Think of it as starting at each of the four edges and moving inward as far as
  possible until it hits pixels of another color (the foreground image).
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>pambackground</b> identifies the background color as follows: If any 3
  corners of the image are the same color, that's the background color. If not,
  but 2 corners are the same color, the background color is the color of a pair
  of identically colored corners in this priority order: top, right, left,
  bottom. If no two corners have the same color, the background color is the
  color of the upper left corner.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In a typical photograph, the area that you would consider the background is many
  shades of a color, so to <b>pambackground</b> it is multiple colors and
  <b>pambackground</b> will not meaningfully identify the background of your
  image. To use <b>pambackground</b> in this case, you might use
  <b>ppmchange</b> to change all similar colors to a single one first. For
  example, if the photograph is a building against a blue sky, where nothing
  remotely sky-blue appears in the building, you could use <b>ppmchange</b> to
  change all pixels within 20% of 'SkyBlue' to SkyBlue, then run
  <b>pambackground</b> on it.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In Release 10.37, <b>pambackground</b> does not really do what is promised
  above. It can't see places where the background appears in the middle of a row
  (think of the sky between two buildings). From Release 10.38 forward, it
  snakes through whatever passages it has to to find all the background.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The PAM that <b>pambackground</b> creates has a single plane, with a maxval of
  1. The sample value 1 means background; 0 means foreground. There is no tuple
  type. Some older programs (but none that are part of Netpbm) don't know what a
  PAM is and expect a mask to be in the form of a PGM or PBM image. To convert
  <b>pambackground</b>'s output to PBM, use <b>pamtopnm -assume</b>. To convert
  to PGM, use <b>pgmtopgm</b>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>netpbmfile</i> is the file specification of the input file, or <b>-</b> to
  indicate Standard Input. The default is Standard Input.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A common use for a background mask is with <b>pamcomp</b>. You could replace the
  entire background (or foreground) of your image with something else.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Another common use is to make an image with the background transparent (in some
  image format that has a concept of transparency; not Netpbm formats) so that
  image can be overlaid onto another image later. Netpbm's converters to image
  formats that have transparency (e.g. PNG) let you use the mask that
  <b>pambackground</b> generates to identify the transparent areas for the
  output.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To simply make a mask of all the areas of a specified color, use
  <b>ppmcolormask</b>. If you have a unique background color (one that doesn't
  occur in the foreground) and know what it is, this can create a background
  mask in cases that <b>pambackground</b> cannot: where there are see-through
  holes in the foreground image.
