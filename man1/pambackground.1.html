<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pambackground - create a mask of the background area of an
image</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pambackground</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[netpbmfile]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[-verbose=]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Minimum unique abbreviations of
options are acceptable. You may use double hyphens instead
of single hyphen to denote options. You may use white space
in place of the equals <br>
sign to separate an option name from its value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This program is part of Netpbm(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pambackground reads a PNM or PAM
image as input. It generates as output a PAM image that
identifies the background area of the image (a mask).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To identify the background,
pambackground assumes the image is a foreground image,
smaller than the total image size, placed over a
single-color background. It assumes that <br>
foreground image is solid -- it does not have holes through
which the background can be seen. So in specific,
pambackground first identifies the background color, then
finds all <br>
contiguous pixels of that color in regions touching any edge
of the image. Think of it as starting at each of the four
edges and moving inward as far as possible until it hits
<br>
pixels of another color (the foreground image).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pambackground identifies the
background color as follows: If any 3 corners of the image
are the same color, that&rsquo;s the background color. If
not, but 2 corners are the same <br>
color, the background color is the color of a pair of
identically colored corners in this priority order: top,
right, left, bottom. If no two corners have the same color,
the <br>
background color is the color of the upper left corner.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In a typical photograph, the
area that you would consider the background is many shades
of a color, so to pambackground it is multiple colors and
pambackground will not meaning&acirc; <br>
fully identify the background of your image. To use
pambackground in this case, you might use ppmchange to
change all similar colors to a single one first. For
example, if the <br>
photograph is a building against a blue sky, where nothing
remotely sky-blue appears in the building, you could use
ppmchange to change all pixels within 20% of
&rsquo;SkyBlue&rsquo; to Sky&acirc; <br>
Blue, then run pambackground on it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In Release 10.37, pambackground
does not really do what is promised above. It can&rsquo;t
see places where the background appears in the middle of a
row (think of the sky between two <br>
buildings). From Release 10.38 forward, it snakes through
whatever passages it has to to find all the background.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The PAM that pambackground
creates has a single plane, with a maxval of 1. The sample
value 1 means background; 0 means foreground. There is no
tuple type. Some older programs <br>
(but none that are part of Netpbm) don&rsquo;t know what a
PAM is and expect a mask to be in the form of a PGM or PBM
image. To convert pambackground&rsquo;s output to PBM, use
pamtopnm <br>
-assume. To convert to PGM, use pgmtopgm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">netpbmfile is the file
specification of the input file, or - to indicate Standard
Input. The default is Standard Input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A common use for a background
mask is with pamcomp. You could replace the entire
background (or foreground) of your image with something
else.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another common use is to make an
image with the background transparent (in some image format
that has a concept of transparency; not Netpbm formats) so
that image can be overlaid <br>
onto another image later. Netpbm&rsquo;s converters to image
formats that have transparency (e.g. PNG) let you use the
mask that pambackground generates to identify the
transparent <br>
areas for the output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To simply make a mask of all the
areas of a specified color, use ppmcolormask. If you have a
unique background color (one that doesn&rsquo;t occur in the
foreground) and know what it <br>
is, this can create a background mask in cases that
pambackground cannot: where there are see-through holes in
the foreground image.</p>
