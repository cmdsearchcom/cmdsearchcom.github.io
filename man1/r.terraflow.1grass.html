<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
r.terraflow takes as input a raster digital elevation model
(DEM) and computes the flow direction raster and the flow
accumulation raster, as well as the flooded elevation <br>
raster, sink-watershed raster (partition into watersheds
around sinks) and TCI (topographic convergence index) raster
maps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">r.terraflow computes these
rasters using well-known approaches, with the difference
that its emphasis is on the computational complexity of the
algorithms, rather than on model&acirc; <br>
ing realistic flow. r.terraflow emerged from the necessity
of having scalable software able to process efficiently very
large terrains. It is based on theoretically optimal <br>
algorithms developed in the framework of I/O-efficient
algorithms. r.terraflow was designed and optimized
especially for massive grids and is able to process terrains
which were <br>
impractical with similar functions existing in other GIS
systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Flow directions are computed
using either the MFD (Multiple Flow Direction) model or the
SFD (Single Flow Direction, or D8) model, illustrated below.
Both methods compute downs&acirc; <br>
lope flow directions by inspecting the 3-by-3 window around
the current cell. The SFD method assigns a unique flow
direction towards the steepest downslope neighbor. The MFD
<br>
method assigns multiple flow directions towards all
downslope neighbors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Flow direction to steepest
downslope neighbor (SFD). Flow direction to all downslope
neighbors (MFD).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The SFD and the MFD method
cannot compute flow directions for cells which have the same
height as all their neighbors (flat areas) or cells which do
not have downslope neighbors <br>
(one-cell pits).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; On plateaus
(flat areas that spill out) r.terraflow routes flow so that
globally the flow goes towards the spill cells of the
plateaus.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; On sinks (flat
areas that do not spill out, including one-cell pits)
r.terraflow assigns flow by flooding the terrain until all
the sinks are filled and assigning flow <br>
directions on the filled terrain.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to flood the terrain,
r.terraflow identifies all sinks and partitions the terrain
into sink-watersheds (a sink-watershed contains all the
cells that flow into that <br>
sink), builds a graph representing the adjacency information
of the sink-watersheds, and uses this sink-watershed graph
to merge watersheds into each other along their lowest <br>
common boundary until all watersheds have a flow path
outside the terrain. Flooding produces a sink-less terrain
in which every cell has a downslope flow path leading
outside the <br>
terrain and therefore every cell in the terrain can be
assigned SFD/MFD flow directions as above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once flow directions are
computed for every cell in the terrain, r.terraflow computes
flow accumulation by routing water using the flow directions
and keeping track of how much <br>
water flows through each cell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If flow accumulation of a cell
is larger than the value given by the d8cut option, then the
flow of this cell is routed to its neighbors using the SFD
(D8) model. This option <br>
affects only the flow accumulation raster and is meaningful
only for MFD flow (i.e. if the -s flag is not used); If this
option is used for SFD flow it is ignored. The default <br>
value of d8cut is infinity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">r.terraflow also computes the
tci raster (topographic convergence index, defined as the
logarithm of the ratio of flow accumulation and local
slope).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For more details on the
algorithms see [1,2,3] below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
One of the techniques used by r.terraflow is the space-time
trade-off. In particular, in order to avoid searches, which
are I/O-expensive, r.terraflow computes and works with an
<br>
augmented elevation raster in which each cell stores
relevant information about its 8 neighbors, in total up to
80B per cell. As a result r.terraflow works with
intermediate <br>
temporary files that may be up to 80N bytes, where N is the
number of cells (rows x columns) in the elevation raster
(more precisely, 80K bytes, where K is the number of valid
<br>
(not no-data) cells in the input elevation raster).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All these intermediate temporary
files are stored in the path specified by the STREAM_DIR
option. Note: STREAM_DIR must contain enough free disk space
in order to store up to 2 x <br>
80N bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The memory option can be used to
set the maximum amount of main memory (RAM) the module will
use during processing. In practice its value should be an
underestimate of the amount <br>
of available (free) main memory on the machine. r.terraflow
will use at all times at most this much memory, and the
virtual memory system (swap space) will never be used. The
<br>
default value is 300 MB.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The stats option defines the
name of the file that contains the statistics (stats) of the
run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">r.terraflow has a limit on the
number of rows and columns (max 32,767 each).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The internal type used by
r.terraflow to store elevations can be defined at
compile-time. By default, r.terraflow is compiled to store
elevations internally as floats. Other ver&acirc; <br>
sions can be created by the user if needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hints concerning compilation
with storage of elevations internally as shorts: <br>
such a version uses less space (up to 60B per cell, up to
60N intermediate file) and therefore is more space and time
efficient. r.terraflow is intended for use with floating
<br>
point raster data (FCELL), and r.terraflow (short) with
integer raster data (CELL) in which the maximum elevation
does not exceed the value of a short SHRT_MAX=32767 (this is
not <br>
a constraint for any terrain data of the Earth, if elevation
is stored in meters). Both r.terraflow and r.terraflow
(short) work with input elevation rasters which can be
either <br>
integer, floating point or double (CELL, FCELL, DCELL). If
the input raster contains a value that exceeds the allowed
internal range (short for r.terraflow (short), float for
<br>
r.terraflow), the program exits with a warning message.
Otherwise, if all values in the input elevation raster are
in range, they will be converted (truncated) to the internal
<br>
elevation type (short for r.terraflow (short), float for
r.terraflow). In this case precision may be lost and
artificial flat areas may be created. For instance, if
r.terraflow <br>
(short) is used with floating point raster data (FCELL or
DCELL), the values of the elevation will be truncated as
shorts. This may create artificial flat areas, and the
output <br>
of r.terraflow (short) may be less realistic than those of
r.terraflow on floating point raster data. The outputs of
r.terraflow (short) and r.terraflow are identical for
inte&acirc; <br>
ger raster data (CELL maps).</p>
