<p>GIT-MERGE-CHANGELOG(1) User Contributed Perl
Documentation GIT-MERGE-CHANGELOG(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
git-merge-changelog - git merge driver for GNU ChangeLog
files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The default merge driver of &rsquo;git&rsquo; always
produces conflicts when pulling public modifications into a
privately modified ChangeLog file. This is because ChangeLog
files are <br>
always modified at the top; the default merge driver has no
clue how to deal with this. Furthermore the conflicts are
presented with more &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; ==== &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
markers than necessary; <br>
this is because the default merge driver makes pointless
efforts to look at the individual line changes inside a
ChangeLog entry.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This program serves as a
&rsquo;git&rsquo; merge driver that avoids these
problems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. It produces no conflict when
ChangeLog entries have been inserted at the top both in the
public and in the private modification. It puts the
privately added entries above the <br>
publicly added entries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. It respects the structure of
ChangeLog files: entries are not split into lines but kept
together.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. It also handles the case of
small modifications of past ChangeLog entries, or of removed
ChangeLog entries: they are merged as one would expect
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. Conflicts are presented at
the top of the file, rather than where they occurred, so
that the user will see them immediately. (Unlike for source
code written in some <br>
programming language, conflict markers that are located
several hundreds lines from the top will not cause any
syntax error and therefore would be likely to remain <br>
unnoticed.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For git users: <br>
- Add to .git/config of the checkout (or to your
$HOME/.gitconfig) the lines</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[merge
&quot;merge-changelog&quot;] <br>
name = GNU-style ChangeLog merge driver <br>
driver = /usr/bin/git-merge-changelog %O %A %B</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- In every directory that
contains a ChangeLog file, add a file
&rsquo;.gitattributes&rsquo; with this line:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ChangeLog
merge=merge-changelog</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(See &quot;man 5
gitattributes&quot; for more info.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For bzr users: <br>
- Install the &rsquo;extmerge&rsquo; bzr plug-in listed at
&lt;http://doc.bazaar.canonical.com/plugins/en/index.html&gt;
&lt;http://wiki.bazaar.canonical.com/BzrPlugins&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Add to your
$HOME/.bazaar/bazaar.conf the line</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">external_merge =
git-merge-changelog %b %T %o</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Then, to merge a conflict in a
ChangeLog file, use</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ bzr extmerge ChangeLog</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For hg users: <br>
- Add to your $HOME/.hgrc the lines</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[merge-patterns] <br>
ChangeLog = git-merge-changelog</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[merge-tools] <br>
git-merge-changelog.executable =
/usr/bin/git-merge-changelog <br>
git-merge-changelog.args = $base $local $other</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See
&lt;http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/hgrc.5.html&gt; section
merge-tools for reference.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use as an alternative to
&rsquo;diff3&rsquo;: <br>
git-merge-changelog performs the same role as &quot;diff3
-m&quot;, just with reordered arguments:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git-merge-changelog %O %A
%B</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">is comparable to</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ diff3 -m %A %O %B</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Calling convention: <br>
A merge driver is called with three filename arguments:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. %O = The common ancestor of
%A and %B.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. %A = The file&rsquo;s
contents from the &quot;current branch&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. %B = The file&rsquo;s
contents from the &quot;other branch&quot;; this is the
contents being merged in.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In case of a &quot;git stash
apply&quot; or of an upstream pull (e.g. from a subsystem
maintainer to a central maintainer) or of a downstream pull
with --rebase:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. %A = The file&rsquo;s newest
pulled contents; modified by other committers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. %B = The user&rsquo;s newest
copy of the file; modified by the user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In case of a downstream pull
(e.g. from a central repository to the user) or of an
upstream pull with --rebase:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. %A = The user&rsquo;s newest
copy of the file; modified by the user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. %B = The file&rsquo;s newest
pulled contents; modified by other committers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It should write its merged
output into file %A. It can also echo some remarks to
stdout. It should exit with return code 0 if the merge could
be resolved cleanly, or with non- <br>
zero return code if there were conflicts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">How it works: <br>
The structure of a ChangeLog file: It consists of ChangeLog
entries. A ChangeLog entry starts at a line following a
blank line and that starts with a non-whitespace character,
or <br>
at the beginning of a file. The merge driver works as
follows: It reads the three files into memory and dissects
them into ChangeLog entries. It then finds the differences
<br>
between %O and %B. They are classified as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- removals (some consecutive
entries removed),</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- changes (some consecutive
entries removed, some consecutive entries added),</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- additions (some consecutive
entries added).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The driver then attempts to
apply the changes to %A. To this effect, it first computes a
correspondence between the entries in %O and the entries in
%A, using fuzzy string <br>
matching to still identify changed entries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Removals are applied one by
one. If the entry is present in %A, at any position, it is
removed. If not, the removal is marked as a conflict.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Additions at the top of %B are
applied at the top of %A.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Additions between entry x and
entry y (y may be the file end) in %B are applied between
entry x and entry y in %A (if they still exist and are still
consecutive in %A), <br>
otherwise the additions are marked as a conflict.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Changes are categorized into
&quot;simple changes&quot;: <br>
entry1 ... entryn are mapped to <br>
added_entry ... added_entry modified_entry1 ...
modified_entryn, where the correspondence between entry_i
and modified_entry_i is still clear; and &quot;big
changes&quot;: these are <br>
all the rest. Simple changes at the top of %B are applied by
putting the added entries at the top of %A. The changes in
simple changes are applied one by one; possibly <br>
leading to single-entry conflicts. Big changes are applied
en bloc, possibly leading to conflicts spanning multiple
entries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Conflicts are output at the
top of the file and cause an exit status of 1.</p>
