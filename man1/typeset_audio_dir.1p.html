<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
typeset_audio_dir - produce TeX listing of directories with
audio files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
# E.g.: current directory contains 1
subdirectory-per-performer. <br>
# Inside each directory the structure is <br>
# Composer/single*.mp3 (fine-grain output: &lt;title&gt;
field) <br>
# and <br>
# Composer/MultiPart/part*.mp3 (fine-grain output:
&lt;album&gt; field) <br>
# Emit year and duration info; use &quot;Quartets&quot; as
basename <br>
typeset_audio_dir -y -T -B Quartets *</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Likewise, but this directory
structure is w.r.t. current directory; <br>
# Do not emit year and duration, output to STDOUT <br>
typeset_audio_dir . <br>
typeset_audio_dir</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Use artist as toplevel
heading, album as the 2nd level; use track numbers; <br>
# name is based on title for any depth in directory
hierarchy; <br>
# likewise for generation of 2nd level heading. Mark audios
with lyrics <br>
typeset_audio_dir -ynTL -P long -B All</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Likewise, but the name is
based on the album; ignore comments <br>
typeset_audio_dir -yTn -P short -B All_short</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Likewise, but produce both
long and short listings. The short one serves <br>
# as a table-of-contents for the long one <br>
typeset_audio_dir -ynTL -P short,long -B All</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Scans directory (or directories) given on the command line,
using MP3::Tag to obtain information about audio files (to
process non-MP3 files, extra modules may be needed, see <br>
MP3::Tag, and -r FILENAME_FILTER option must be given).
Produces (one or more, depending on -B option) TeX files
with commands to typeset human-readable listings. Non- <br>
directories on the command line are ignored. (May also be
used to process non-audio files, if MP3::Tag may extract the
title/etc info from them.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With -B, the file *_list.tex
contains all the data about audio files (when -P with both
&quot;short,long&quot; is given, another similar file
*_list_long.tex is also written); the file <br>
*_titles.tex contains a 0th approximation to the possible
&quot;title&quot; of the collection (one based on -N option
and a short summary of toplevel directories). The file
*_common.tex <br>
contains macros common for the following files. The
remaining files define different environments to typeset the
listing (including two TeX files with &quot;content&quot; as
needed): a <br>
&quot;normal&quot; listing (for A4/Letter, *_text.tex), two
flavors of a &quot;compressed&quot; listing (for jewel case
insert, *_cdbooklet.tex and *_cdcover.tex), and a back
insert for the jewel <br>
case (*_backcover.tex).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The intent is to support many
different layouts of directories with audio files with as
little tinkering with command-line options as possible; thus
&quot;type_audio_dir&quot; tries to do <br>
as much as possible by guestimates. Similtaneously, one
should be able to tune the script to handle the layout they
have.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The script emits headers for
several levels of &quot;grouping&quot;. The
&quot;toplevel&quot; group header is emited once for every
&quot;toplevel&quot; directory (with audio files), further
headers are <br>
emited based on changes in descriptors of the audio files
during scan.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-B gives basename of the output file. Without this option
the script will output to STDOUT. With this option, script
separates the layout from content, and produces 6 TeX <br>
files:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">basename_text.tex <br>
basename_cdcover.tex <br>
basename_cdbooklet.tex <br>
basename_backcover.tex <br>
basename_list.tex <br>
basename_titles.tex <br>
basename_common.tex</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The last file contains the
common macros needed for typesetting. The previous two files
contain the information about audio files encountered. The
others files contain <br>
frameworks to typeset this information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first four files are
supposed to be human-editable; they will not be overwritten
by a following rerun with the same basename given to the
script. By editing these files, <br>
one can choose between several encodings, languages,
multicolumn output, font size, interline spacing, margins,
page size etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;*_titles.tex&quot;
file is of mixed nature: it reflects the content of audio
files, and is supposed to be human-editable. It will be
overwritten unless it is Read-Only; so <br>
if you hand-edit it, make it Read-Only. Similar overwrite
logic is applied to &quot;*_common.tex&quot; file too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P &quot;plan&quot; <br>
a shortcut to setting hairy options; currently, two values
of &quot;plan&quot; are supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">short =&gt; -1 &quot;&quot; -2
&quot;&quot; -t -1e100 -a -1e100 -c <br>
long =&gt; -1 &quot;&quot; -2 &quot;@l&quot; -t 1e100 -a
1e100</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">for generation of short/long
listings. In the short listing, records correspond to the
album names. In the long listing, records correspond to
individual files, and album <br>
names serve as second-level headings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-y Emit year (or date)
information if present. Very long date descriptors (e.g.,
when multiple ranges of dates are present) are compressed as
much as possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Y Emit the whole date
information if present.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T Emit duration
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Enable emit track number.
Environment variable TYPESET_AUDIO_TRACK may contain the
format to interpolate for typesetting (defaults to
&quot;%{mA}%{n1}&quot;). For example, set <br>
TYPESET_AUDIO_TRACK to &quot;%{n1}&quot; to use
&quot;pure&quot; track number instead of combination of
media/disk number and track number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-1 Toplevel header format; is
interpolate()d by MP3::Tag based on the content of the first
audio file encountered during scan of this toplevel
directory. The empty value is the <br>
default; in this case the header is based on the name of the
directory (with some normalization: underscore is converted
to space).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-2 Second-level heading format;
is interpolate()d by MP3::Tag. Calculated based on the
content of each audio file. The heading is emited when the
interpolated value changes <br>
(subject to option -a).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Empty string disables
generation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a Ignore changes to the
second-level heading for directories deeper than this inside
top-level directory. Defaults to 2. For example, in</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">Performer/Composer/Collection/part1.mp3
<br>
Performer/Composer/Collection/part2.mp3 <br>
Performer/Composer/single1.mp3 <br>
Performer/Composer/single2.mp3</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if the toplevel directory is
Performer, then changes of the second-level header in
single*.mp3 would create a new second-level heading.
However, similar changes in part*.mp3 <br>
will not create a new heading.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: maybe this default of 2 is
not very intuitive. It is recommended to explicitly set this
option to the value you feel appropriate (1e100 would play
role of infinity - <br>
so any change will generate a new second-level heading).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t The title-cutoff depth
(w.r.t. toplevel directory). Defaults to 2. In audio files
deeper than this the album %l is used as the name; otherwise
the title %t of the audio <br>
file is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Set to &quot;-1e100&quot; to
always use %l, and to 1e100 to always use %a.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-@ Replace all &quot;@&quot; by
&quot;%&quot; in options. Very useful with DOSISH shells to
include &quot;%&quot;-escapes necessary for MP3::Tag&rsquo;s
interpolate().</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e ENCODINGS <br>
Sets encodings for output files, directory names (when uses
to generate headings), and hint files. ENCODINGS is a
comma-separated list of directives; each directive is <br>
either an encoding name (to use for all targets), or
&quot;TARGET_LETTERS:encoding&quot;. Target letters are
&quot;o&quot;, &quot;d&quot;, and &quot;h&quot; for output,
names of directories, and files .top_heading <br>
correspondingly. Use 0 instead of an encoding to do
byte-oriented read/write.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c What to use as
&quot;comment&quot; for a record (a part which is typeset
differently). If not given, the ID3v2 frame
&quot;TXXX[add-to:file-by-person,l,t,n]&quot; is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the content of this field is
contained at end of the title, nothing is added, just this
part is typeset differently.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L Mark files with embedded
(un)syncronized lyrics and pictures. Put the explanation of
used symbols at the end of the listing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N COLLECTION_NAME <br>
(defaults to &quot;COLLECTION&quot;) the name of the
collection to insert into the file *_title.tex. The
interaction with encoding may be less than intuitive; you
may want to <br>
check/edit this file for corrections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F FONT_ENCODING_SYMBOL <br>
(defaults to &quot;T2A&quot;): the name of &quot;LaTeX&quot;
font encoding. If your installation is broken and
&quot;T2A&quot; is not available, you may try &quot;T1&quot;
or &quot;OT1&quot;. See &quot;PROBLEMS when <br>
TYPESETTING&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r FILENAME_FILTER <br>
sets the regular expression for filenames to look for (the
default is &quot;(?i:.mp3$)&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Info read from file system <br>
The following files are used to give hints to
typeset_audio_dir:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">.content_comment <br>
Content of this file is used as a comment field in the
output for all files in this directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">.top_heading <br>
If empty, indicates that when the depth of files modifies
the output, it is calculated w.r.t. the subdirectories of
the directory of this file (ouph!). If contains a number,
<br>
it is added to this depth.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example: suppose your section
heading is based on directory names. Suppose the directory
tree to process contains a directory Mixed/2009. If you want
names of <br>
subdirectories of this directory to become section headings,
make file Mixed/2009/.top_heading which contains 0. If the
same holds for other subdirectories of Mixed, instead <br>
of creation of such file in all year-subdirectories, one can
make file Mixed/.top_heading which contains
&quot;-1&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Otherwise the content of this
file is used as a toplevel heading for this directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TYPESETTING <br>
Running this script will only generate necessary TeX files,
but will not typeset them (they will look much better if you
first edit the files to suit your needs). Recall how to <br>
typeset TeX documents (here we assume PDF target):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">latex document.tex &amp;&amp;
dvips document.dvi &amp;&amp; ps2pdf document</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(a lot of temporary files are
going to be generated too; you can break this into multiple
commands on &quot;&amp;&amp;&quot;). Some of the files
(e.g., ..._cdcover.tex) fit better with landscape <br>
orientation; one needs</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">latex document.tex &amp;&amp;
dvips -t landscape document.dvi &amp;&amp; ps2pdf
document</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With ..._cdbooklet.tex, for best
result, one better should rearrange pages for booklet 2up
2-pages-per-side printing:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">latex document.tex <br>
&amp;&amp; dvips -t landscape -f &lt; document.dvi | psbook
| pstops &quot;2:0(0,-6cm)+1(0,6cm)&quot; &gt; document.ps
<br>
&amp;&amp; ps2pdf -dAutoRotatePages=/None document</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(all on one line, or give 3
separate commands, breaking on &quot;&amp;&amp;&quot;; more
details on running dvips is put in the beginning of the TeX
file). If you can easily print a .ps file, you <br>
can omit the last step. (The option
&quot;-dAutoRotatePages=/None&quot; interferes with viewing;
one may omit it unless one does &quot;extra flipping of even
pages&quot;, as below.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that this assumes that when
you send files to printer you request duplexing with
&quot;binding on the short side of paper&quot;. If you
printer can survive manual duplexing, do as <br>
usual: print first the even pages in opposite order, reload
paper, then print odd pages (you need to understand in which
orientation you must put paper back when reloading; there
<br>
are 4 variants, and only one is correct ;-). For
&quot;real&quot; duplex printers, see below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROBLEMS when TYPESETTING <br>
incomplete installations <br>
! Font T2A/cmr/m/n/10.95=larm1095 at 10.95pt not loadable:
<br>
Metric (TFM) file not found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For best multilanguage coverage
I could find, by default the generated LaTeX files use
&quot;T2A&quot;-encoded-fonts with extra Latin characters
provided by &quot;textcomp&quot;. Apparently, <br>
some &quot;TeX&quot; installations omit &quot;T2A&quot;
encoding tables. You may want to change &quot;T2A&quot; to,
e.g., &quot;T1&quot; by using option &quot;-F T1&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In a booklet, page 1 is at end,
the rest is a mess <br>
The &quot;landscape&quot; option of &quot;geometry&quot;
package should rotate the page 90 degrees. Depending on the
way it is configured, the direction of rotation varies. If
.pdf file <br>
obtained with &quot;-dAutoRotatePages=/None&quot; option has
top of page on the left, you may need to invert the
direction of shifting: instead of
&quot;2:0(0,-6cm)+1(0,6cm)&quot; one should use <br>
&quot;2:0(0,6cm)+1(0,-6cm)&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Duplexing with &quot;bind on the
long side of paper&quot; <br>
By default, most duplex printers are configured to
&quot;bind on the long side of paper&quot;; so to avoid
manual setup of binding options, you may want to flip even
pages in the <br>
generated file. To do this, add an extra ps2ps step at the
end of pipeline, e.g.:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">... psbook | pstops
&quot;2:0(0,-6cm)+1(0,6cm)&quot; | pstops
&quot;2:0,1U(1w,1h)&quot; &gt; document.ps</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A4-sized paper vs. Letter-sized
paper <br>
Some TeX/PS installations do not have correctly set-up site
configuration files, so do not know what is the usual paper
size on your printer. Fortunately, all steps of the <br>
typesetting pipeline allow a manual reconfiguration.
Unfortunately, command options for the required
reconfigurations are subtly different for different
steps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, if your
TeX/PS-utils think that your paper size is
&quot;letter&quot;, while what you actually print to is
&quot;a4&quot;, you need to do the following (depending on
which <br>
configuration files are broken, you might be able to omit
some modifications):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. Add &quot;a4paper&quot; to
the &quot;sepackage[...,...]{geometry}&quot; options (the
comma-separated list in brackets) in TeX files which use
&quot;geometry&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Add &quot;-t a4&quot; as a
&quot;dvips&quot; options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. Add &quot;-pa4&quot; as a
&quot;pstops&quot; option. (If it breaks rotation, omit it,
sigh!)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. Add
&quot;-sPAPERSIZE=a4&quot; as a &quot;ps2pdf&quot;
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example commandline working with
some of complications</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dvips -t landscape -f &lt;
All_cdbooklet-a4.dvi | psbook | pstops -pa4
&quot;2:0(0,-6cm)+1(0,6cm)&quot; | pstops -pa4
&quot;2:0,1U(1w,1h)&quot; &gt; Output-even_flipped-a4.ps
<br>
&amp;&amp; ps2pdf -sPAPERSIZE=a4 -dAutoRotatePages=/None
Output-even_flipped-a4</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Likewise, quite often one needs
to add &quot;-pletter&quot; to &quot;ps2ps&quot;
commandlines for correct printing to letter-size paper. You
can check the resulting PDF file in a viewer: the <br>
status line should show the correct paper size (e.g., 8.5in
x 11in is &quot;Letter&quot;), even pages should be flipped
(for binding &quot;on the long side&quot;), and the
wireframes on <br>
different pages should be positioned exactly at same
positions (for visual verification, choose
&quot;fit-to-page&quot; scaling, and quickly switch pages
back-and-forth by keyboard or <br>
by &quot;Next page&quot; button).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warnings from dvips <br>
Note also that if your &quot;TeX/dvips&quot; installation is
completely correct, you can remove &quot;-t landscape&quot;
from your &quot;dvips&quot; command line; not removing it
would produce a warning <br>
&quot;both both landscape and papersize specified: ignoring
landscape&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Systematic duplexing offset <br>
Some printers can&rsquo;t reliably match positions on the
front and back side when printing; there is little one can
do with it. However, if your printer adds some consistent
<br>
misplacement of front and back sides, one can put
workarounds for it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, when &quot;binding
on the short side&quot;, the common error is that (in
landscape orientation) backside is offset horizontally
w.r.t. frontside. For example, if offset <br>
is 3.4mm to the left, one can shift the image on the page by
half of this, 0.17cm to the left: replace
&quot;2:0(0,-6cm)+1(0,6cm)&quot; by
&quot;2:0(0,-6.17cm)+1(0,5.83cm)&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With &quot;binding on the long
side&quot;, the typical error is vertical offset. To work
around, one needs to shift vertically (again, by half the
amount) after flipping even pages. <br>
To shift 0.17cm up, add an extra step &quot;pstops
&quot;(0.17cm,0)&quot;&quot; to the pipeline after the
&quot;2:0,1U(1w,1h)&quot; step (untested).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HINTS <br>
The default font sizes and density of type is chosen to
optimize printing of a DL-DVD collection of short high
quality audio (of song-like duration: about 100 subheadings,
and <br>
2000 audio files). You may improve the visual quality if you
tune the typesetting to your particular needs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The most commonly changed
settings are on top of the generated files. These are fonts
and degrees of vertical squeeze of paragraphs for the
principal title, titles of sections <br>
(1st level) and subsections (2nd level), and of actual
records emited for each audio file, as well as the number of
columns. Slightly further in the file are settings for gaps
<br>
to left around section headings, and for fine-tuning of
squeezing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Do not forget that if you
can&rsquo;t describe a complicated layout by command-line
options, you still have a possibility to run this script
many times (once per directory with <br>
&quot;handable layout&quot;, using -B and other options
suitable for this subdirectory). Then you can use LaTeX
&quot;input&quot; directives to include the generated
basename_list.tex files into <br>
the toplevel &quot;LaTeX&quot; file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also redefine
&quot;reSection * ostSection&quot; to do nothing, and put
the necessary code to generate the headers into the
top-level file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Modify the formatting macros to
suit your needs. (Of more tricky stuff, mention
&quot;eezeContunuationLines&quot; and &quot;arskip&quot;,
which regulate the density of lines - without <br>
changing the line font; note that setting &quot;arskip&quot;
is a part of the action of
&quot;eezeContunuationLines&quot;. &quot; can also fine-tune
the vertical position of the start of the first page; for
backcover, also tune up &quot;and &quot; The definition(s)
of <br>
&quot;eezeContunuationLines&quot; are commented out (by
&quot;%&quot;) in non-*_common.tex files; you may uncomment
it, and tune it up separately for each TeX file.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One can combine two (or more)
lists (e.g., one with the short style, and one with the long
style) into one output file; the generated files
..._cdbooklet.tex and ..._text.tex <br>
already have a necessary template (disabled) at the end.
(Moreover, with -P &quot;short,long&quot;, this is done
automatically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, with two lists
created in &quot;SYNOPSIS&quot;, All_list.tex, and
All_short_list.tex, find &quot;iffalse&quot; near the end of
All_short_cdbooklet.tex and change it to &quot;iftrue&quot;;
then <br>
change the name in the directive</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">input{another_list}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">to All_list</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This will make the
&quot;short&quot; cdbooklet become a kind of &quot;table of
contents&quot; for the combined &quot;short+long&quot;
cdbooklet. (Of course, one can change the values of macros
&quot;tionFont&quot; <br>
etc, &quot;type of squeeze to suit your needs - the point is
that they should not be necessarily the same for the second
list.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WORKFLOW <br>
The module is quite flexible; here is one of the possible
workflows (suitable if all you need is -P &lt;short&gt; and
-P &lt;long&gt;:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Put all the &quot;toplevel&quot;
directories as subdirectories of the current directory
(well, this is not really necessary!), and put the heading
to use for each directory into a file <br>
.top_heading. You may need to specify the encoding used in
this file into the options (do similar to &quot;-e
h:cp1252&quot;).</p>
