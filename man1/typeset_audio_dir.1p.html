Scans directory (or directories) given on the command line, using MP3::Tag to
  obtain information about audio files (to process non-MP3 files, extra modules
  may be needed, see MP3::Tag, and <b>-r</b> <b>FILENAME_FILTER</b> option must
  be given). Produces (one or more, depending on <b>-B</b> option) <b>TeX</b>
  files with commands to typeset human-readable listings. Non-directories on the
  command line are ignored. (May also be used to process non-audio files, if
  MP3::Tag may extract the title/etc info from them.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
With <b>-B</b>, the file <i>*_list.tex</i> contains all the data about audio
  files (when <b>-P</b> with both &quot;short,long&quot; is given, another
  similar file <i>*_list_long.tex</i> is also written); the file
  <i>*_titles.tex</i> contains a 0th approximation to the possible
  &quot;title&quot; of the collection (one based on <b>-N</b> option and a short
  summary of toplevel directories). The file <i>*_common.tex</i> contains macros
  common for the following files. The remaining files define different
  environments to typeset the listing (including two TeX files with
  &quot;content&quot; as needed): a &quot;normal&quot; listing (for A4/Letter,
  <i>*_text.tex</i>), two flavors of a &quot;compressed&quot; listing (for jewel
  case insert, <i>*_cdbooklet.tex</i> and <i>*_cdcover.tex</i>), and a back
  insert for the jewel case ( <i>*_backcover.tex</i>).
<div class="Pp"></div>
The intent is to support many different layouts of directories with audio files
  with as little tinkering with command-line options as possible; thus
  &quot;type_audio_dir&quot; tries to do as much as possible by guestimates.
  Similtaneously, one should be able to tune the script to handle the layout
  they have.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The script emits headers for several levels of &quot;grouping&quot;. The
  &quot;toplevel&quot; group header is emited once for every
  &quot;toplevel&quot; directory (with audio files), further headers are emited
  based on changes in descriptors of the audio files during scan.

    The last file contains the common macros needed for typesetting. The
      previous two files contain the information about audio files encountered.
      The others files contain frameworks to typeset this information.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The first four files are supposed to be human-editable; they will not be
      overwritten by a following rerun with the same basename given to the
      script. By editing these files, one can choose between several encodings,
      languages, multicolumn output, font size, interline spacing, margins, page
      size etc.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The &quot;*_titles.tex&quot; file is of mixed nature: it reflects the
      content of audio files, <i>and</i> is supposed to be human-editable. It
      will be overwritten unless it is Read-Only; so if you hand-edit it, make
      it Read-Only. Similar overwrite logic is applied to
      &quot;*_common.tex&quot; file too.</dd>

Running this script will only generate necessary TeX files, but will not typeset
  them (they will look much better if you first edit the files to suit your
  needs). Recall how to typeset TeX documents (here we assume PDF target):
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  latex document.tex &amp;&amp; dvips document.dvi &amp;&amp; ps2pdf document
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
(a lot of temporary files are going to be generated too; you can break this into
  multiple commands on &quot;&amp;&amp;&quot;). Some of the files (e.g.,
  <i>..._cdcover.tex</i>) fit better with landscape orientation; one needs
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  latex document.tex &amp;&amp; dvips -t landscape document.dvi &amp;&amp; ps2pdf document
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
With <i>..._cdbooklet.tex</i>, for best result, one better should rearrange
  pages for booklet 2up 2-pages-per-side printing:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  latex document.tex
    &amp;&amp; dvips -t landscape -f &lt; document.dvi | psbook | pstops &quot;2:0(0,-6cm)+1(0,6cm)&quot; &gt; document.ps
    &amp;&amp; ps2pdf -dAutoRotatePages=/None document
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
(all on one line, or give 3 separate commands, breaking on
  &quot;&amp;&amp;&quot;; more details on running dvips is put in the beginning
  of the TeX file). If you can easily print a <i>.ps</i> file, you can omit the
  last step. (The option &quot;-dAutoRotatePages=/None&quot; interferes with
  viewing; one may omit it <i>unless</i> one does &quot;extra flipping of even
  pages&quot;, as below.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that this assumes that when you send files to printer you request duplexing
  with &quot;binding on the short side of paper&quot;. If you printer can
  survive manual duplexing, do as usual: print first the even pages in opposite
  order, reload paper, then print odd pages (you need to understand in which
  orientation you must put paper back when reloading; there are 4 variants, and
  only one is correct ;-). For &quot;real&quot; duplex printers, see below.

Likewise, quite often one needs to add &quot;-pletter&quot; to &quot;ps2ps&quot;
  commandlines for correct printing to letter-size paper. You can check the
  resulting PDF file in a viewer: the status line should show the correct paper
  size (e.g., 8.5in x 11in is &quot;Letter&quot;), even pages should be flipped
  (for binding &quot;on the long side&quot;), and the wireframes on different
  pages should be positioned exactly at same positions (for visual verification,

      sides, one can put workarounds for it.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    For example, when &quot;binding on the short side&quot;, the common error is
      that (in landscape orientation) backside is offset horizontally w.r.t.
      frontside. For example, if offset is 3.4mm to the left, one can shift the
      image on the page by half of this, 0.17cm to the left: replace
      &quot;2:0(0,-6cm)+1(0,6cm)&quot; by
      &quot;2:0(0,-6.17cm)+1(0,5.83cm)&quot;.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    With &quot;binding on the long side&quot;, the typical error is vertical
      offset. To work around, one needs to shift vertically (again, by half the
      amount) <i>after</i> flipping even pages. To shift 0.17cm up, add an extra
      step &quot;pstops &quot;(0.17cm,0)&quot;&quot; to the pipeline after the

<div class="Pp"></div>
The most commonly changed settings are on top of the generated files. These are
  fonts and degrees of vertical squeeze of paragraphs for the principal title,
  titles of sections (1st level) and subsections (2nd level), and of actual
  records emited for each audio file, as well as the number of columns. Slightly
  further in the file are settings for gaps to left around section headings, and
  for fine-tuning of squeezing.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Do not forget that if you can't describe a complicated layout by command-line
  options, you still have a possibility to run this script many times (once per
  directory with &quot;handable layout&quot;, using <b>-B</b> and other options
  suitable for this subdirectory). Then you can use <b>LaTeX</b>
  &quot;\input&quot; directives to include the generated
  <i>basename_list.tex</i> files into the toplevel &quot;LaTeX&quot; file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can also redefine &quot;\preSection * \postSection&quot; to do nothing, and
  put the necessary code to generate the headers into the top-level file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Modify the formatting macros to suit your needs. (Of more tricky stuff, mention
  &quot;\squeezeContunuationLines&quot; and &quot;\parskip&quot;, which regulate
  the density of lines - without changing the line font; note that setting
  &quot;\parskip&quot; is a part of the action of
  &quot;\squeezeContunuationLines&quot;. &quot;\columnsep&quot; regulates the
  horizontal separation of columns. One can also fine-tune the vertical position
  of the start of the first page; for backcover, also tune up
  &quot;\CDbackMargin&quot; and &quot;\CDbackTopMargin&quot;. The definition(s)
  of &quot;\squeezeContunuationLines&quot; are commented out (by &quot;%&quot;)
  in non- <i>*_common.tex</i> files; you may uncomment it, and tune it up
  separately for each TeX file.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
One can combine two (or more) lists (e.g., one with the short style, and one
  with the long style) into one output file; the generated files
  <i>..._cdbooklet.tex</i> and <i>..._text.tex</i> already have a necessary
  template (disabled) at the end. (Moreover, with <b>-P</b>
  &quot;short,long&quot;, this is done automatically.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For example, with two lists created in &quot;SYNOPSIS&quot;,
  <i>All_list.tex</i>, and <i>All_short_list.tex</i>, find &quot;\iffalse&quot;
  near the end of <i>All_short_cdbooklet.tex</i> and change it to
  &quot;\iftrue&quot;; then change the name in the directive
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    \input{another_list}
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
to <i>All_list</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This will make the &quot;short&quot; cdbooklet become a kind of &quot;table of
  contents&quot; for the combined &quot;short+long&quot; cdbooklet. (Of course,
  one can change the values of macros &quot;\SectionFont&quot; etc,
  &quot;\COLUMNS&quot;, type of squeeze to suit your needs - the point is that
  they should not be necessarily the same for the second list.)
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="WORKFLOW"><a class="selflink" href="#WORKFLOW">WORKFLOW</a></h1>
The module is quite flexible; here is one of the possible workflows (suitable if
  all you need is <b>-P</b> &lt;short&gt; and <b>-P</b> &lt;long&gt;:
<div class="Pp"></div>
Put all the &quot;toplevel&quot; directories as subdirectories of the current
  directory (well, this is not really necessary!), and put the heading to use
  for each directory into a file <i>.top_heading</i>. You may need to specify
  the encoding used in this file into the options (do similar to &quot;-e
  h:cp1252&quot;).</div>
