<p>FOLDER(1) General Commands Manual FOLDER(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
folder, folders - set/list current folder/message</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
folder [+folder] [msg] [-all | -noall] [-create | -nocreate]
[-fast | -nofast] [-header | -noheader] [-recurse |
-norecurse] [-total | -nototal] [-list | -nolist] [-push |
-pop] <br>
[-pack | -nopack] [-print] [-verbose | -noverbose]
[-version] [-help]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">folders is equivalent to folder
-all</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Since the nmh environment is the shell, it is easy to lose
track of the current folder from day to day. When folder is
given the -print switch (the default), folder will list <br>
the current folder, the number of messages in it, the range
of the messages (low-high), and the current message within
the folder, and will flag extra files if they exist. An <br>
example of this summary is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">inbox+ has 16 messages ( 3- 22);
cur= 5.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a +folder and/or msg are
specified, they will become the current folder and/or
message. By comparison, when a +folder argument is given,
this corresponds to a &acirc;cd&acirc; operation <br>
in the shell; when no +folder argument is given, this
corresponds roughly to a &acirc;pwd&acirc; operation in the
shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the specified (or default)
folder doesn&rsquo;t exist, the default action is to query
the user as to whether the folder should be created; when
standard input is not a tty, the <br>
answer to the query is assumed to be &acirc;yes&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specifying -create will cause
folder to create new folders without any query. (This is the
easy way to create an empty folder for use later.)
Specifying -nocreate will cause <br>
folder to exit without creating a non-existant folder.
Specifying -all will produce a summary line for each
top-level folder in the user&rsquo;s nmh directory, sorted
alphabetically. <br>
(If folder is invoked by a name ending with &acirc;s&acirc;
(e.g. folders), -all is assumed). Specifying -recurse with
-all will also produce a line for all sub-folders. These
folders are <br>
all preceded by the read-only folders, which occur as
&acirc;atr-cur-&acirc; entries in the user&rsquo;s nmh
context. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FOLDER # MESSAGES RANGE CUR
(OTHERS) <br>
/var/work/folder has 35 messages ( 1- 35); cur=23. <br>
/usr/bugs/Mail has 82 messages ( 1-108); cur=82. <br>
ff has no messages. <br>
inbox+ has 16 messages ( 3- 22); cur= 5. <br>
mh has 76 messages (15- 76); cur=70. <br>
notes has 2 messages ( 1- 2); cur= 1. <br>
ucom has 124 messages ( 1-124); cur= 6; (others). <br>
TOTAL = 339 messages in 7 folders</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &acirc;+&acirc; after inbox
indicates that it is the current folder. The
&acirc;(others)&acirc; indicates that the folder ucom has
files which aren&rsquo;t messages. These files may either be
sub-fold&acirc; <br>
ers, or files that don&rsquo;t belong under the nmh file
naming scheme.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The header is output if either a
-all or a -header switch is specified. It is suppressed by
-noheader.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The folder and message totals
are output if either a -all or a -total switch is specified.
It is suppressed by -nototal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If -fast is given, only the
folder name (or names in the case of -all) will be listed.
(This is faster because the folders need not be read.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a +folder is given along with
the -all switch, folder will, in addition to setting the
current folder, list the top-level subfolders for the
current folder (with -norecurse) <br>
or list all sub-folders under the current folder recursively
(with -recurse).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If msg is supplied, together
with +folder or without -all, it will become the current
message of +folder (if it had been supplied) or the current
folder.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -recurse switch lists each
folder recursively, so use of this option effectively
defeats the speed enhancement of the -fast option, since
each folder must be searched for <br>
subfolders. Nevertheless, the combination of these options
is useful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Compacting a Folder <br>
The -pack switch will compress the message names in the
designated folders, removing holes in message numbering. The
-verbose switch directs folder to tell the user the general
<br>
actions that it is taking to compress the folder.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Folder Stack <br>
The -push switch directs folder to push the current folder
onto the folder-stack, and make the +folder argument the
current folder. If +folder is not given, the current folder
<br>
and the top of the folder-stack are exchanged. This
corresponds to the &acirc;pushd&acirc; operation in the
shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -pop switch directs folder
to discard the top of the folder-stack, after setting the
current folder to that value. No +folder argument is
allowed. This corresponds to the <br>
&acirc;popd&acirc; operation in the shell. The -push switch
and the -pop switch are mutually exclusive: the last
occurrence of either one overrides any previous occurrence
of the other. <br>
Both of these switches also set -list by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -list switch directs folder
to list the contents of the folder-stack. No +folder
argument is allowed. After a successful -push or -pop, the
-list action is taken, unless a <br>
-nolist switch follows them on the command line. This
corresponds to the &acirc;dirs&acirc; operation in the
shell. The -push, -pop, and -list switches turn off
-print.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
$HOME/.mh_profile The user&rsquo;s profile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROFILE COMPONENTS <br>
Path: To determine the user&rsquo;s nmh directory. <br>
Current-Folder: To find the default current folder. <br>
Folder-Protect: To set mode when creating a new folder. <br>
Folder-Stack: To determine the folder stack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
mhpath(1), refile(1), rmf(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEFAULTS <br>
+folder The current folder. <br>
msg &acirc;none&acirc; <br>
-nofast <br>
-noheader <br>
-nototal <br>
-nopack <br>
-norecurse <br>
-noverbose <br>
-print is the default if no -list, -push, or -pop is
specified. <br>
-list is the default if -push, or -pop is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONTEXT <br>
If +folder and/or msg are given, they will become the
current folder and/or message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
There is no way to restore the default behavior (to ask the
user whether to create a non-existant folder) after -create
or -nocreate is given.</p>
