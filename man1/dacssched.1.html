<p>DACSSCHED(1) DACS Commands Manual DACSSCHED(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
dacssched - rule-based command scheduling</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
dacssched [-h | -help] [-ll log_level] [-q] [{-r | -rules}
rules_uri] [{-s | -sched} sched_uri] [-v]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dacssched --version</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This program is part of the DACS suite. It is a stand-alone
program that neither accepts the usual DACS command line
options (dacsoptions) nor accesses any DACS configuration
<br>
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The dacssched command runs other
programs when specified conditions have been met. It does
this by periodically examining a schedule, which, for each
scheduled event, identifies <br>
the necessary conditions and the command line to be executed
should the conditions be satisfied. Rules are stored
separately from the schedule, although in a future version
it <br>
might be possible to contain them with their schedule.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Although dacssched is
conceptually similar to cron(8)[1], atrun(8)[2], and other
programs used to schedule a command to be executed or a
reminder to be sent at certain times or <br>
dates, there are some important differences. First, because
the DACS rule evaluation engine is used, conditions much
more broad and complex than simply the time or date can be
<br>
used to schedule a command - DACS expressions[3] are
available. For instance, a rule to manage automated file
backup could be written to take into account context other
than <br>
simply the day of the week and the time of day, if necessary
even running external programs to assist in making the
determination. Second, both a schedule and the rules <br>
referenced by a schedule are accessed through the DACS
virtual filestore, which means they can be stored in file or
database, retrieved by HTTP, and so on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note <br>
Although this program may be useful, it is currently merely
a prototype intended for demonstration and experimentation
purposes. Some configuration capabilities, features, <br>
and security steps required by a production version have not
been implemented. The prototype must be invoked
periodically; a production version would run in the
background <br>
and automatically rescan the schedule at a given frequency.
Note that because of its flexibility, the schedule must be
polled at a suitable frequency - in general, the <br>
program cannot compute when the next scheduled event will
occur. Also because events need not be triggered by a time
or date, some events may need to &quot;self-disabling&quot;
so that <br>
they are not repeatedly executed unintentionally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Operation <br>
The program loads a schedule, which either comes from a
default file or a location specified on the command line. A
schedule is an ordinary text file, each line of which is
<br>
either blank, a comment, or a scheduled event. The file is
processed in the order in which the events appear from the
top. Initial whitespace on any line is ignored. A comment
<br>
line begins with a &quot;#&quot; character. A scheduled
event consists of a name, followed by whitespace, followed
by a command. If name evaluates to True (i.e., it grants
access), the <br>
command is executed through system(3)[4]. If rule evaluation
fails because of an error, the event is not executed. Events
are not removed from the schedule after their command <br>
has been executed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A name, which must begin with a
slash, has no significance to dacssched; it is simply a
label that is used to identify the rule to apply and is
matched against a rule&rsquo;s service <br>
element.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here is a simple schedule
containing one event:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># A simple schedule <br>
/setdate /usr/local/sbin/rdate -a</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the condition labelled
/setdate is True the specified command will be executed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A simple rule such as the
following might be associated with the event:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;acl_rule
status=&quot;enabled&quot;&gt; <br>
&lt;services&gt; <br>
&lt;service url_pattern=&quot;/setdate&quot;/&gt; <br>
&lt;/services&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;rule
order=&quot;allow,deny&quot;&gt; <br>
&lt;allow&gt; <br>
time(hour) eq 2 and time(min) eq 0 <br>
&lt;/allow&gt; <br>
&lt;/rule&gt; <br>
&lt;/acl_rule&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This rule enables the event
/setdate at 2:00am every day. We will assume that the
schedule is processed exactly once per minute.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Internally, dacssched converts
the scheduled event above into the expression:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rule(&quot;/setdate&quot;,
rule_uri)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(where rule_uri specifies the
ruleset to use) and then evaluates the expression. Please
refer to the rule predicate[5] for additional
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The arguments are processed as they are examined
(left-to-right) and their ordering can be significant.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, the program will
look for a schedule in the file
${Conf::DACS_HOME}/dacssched/sched. (default:
/usr/local/dacs/dacssched/sched) The default location for
the rules is <br>
${Conf::DACS_HOME}/dacssched/acls. (default:
/usr/local/dacs/dacssched/acls)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following command line flags
are recognized:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h <br>
Prints the usage blurb.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ll log_level <br>
Set the debugging output level to log_level (see
dacs(1)[6]). The default level is warn, and the -v flag
bumps the level to debug or trace.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q <br>
Be quiet, except for error messages. The -v and -ll flags
are independent of this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r rule_uri <br>
-rules rule_uri <br>
This flag specifies the ruleset to be used. It can be an
absolute pathname or a URI in the syntax of the VFS[7]
configuration directive. Examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r
&quot;[acls1]dacs-fs:/local/acls&quot; <br>
-rules /usr/local/myrules</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s sched_uri <br>
-sched sched_uri <br>
This flag specifies the schedule. It can be an absolute
pathname or a URI in the syntax of the VFS[7] configuration
directive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v <br>
Increase the level of debugging output. The flag may be
repeated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Display the program&rsquo;s version information and then
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
The program exits 0 if everything was fine, 1 if an error
occurred.</p>
