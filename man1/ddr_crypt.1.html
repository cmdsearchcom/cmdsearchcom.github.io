<p>ddr_crypt(1) En/Decryption plugin for dd_rescue
ddr_crypt(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ddr_crypt - Data de/encryption plugin for dd_rescue</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
-L crypt[=option[:option[:...]]] <br>
or <br>
-L /path/to/libddr_crypt.so[=option[:option[:...]]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
About <br>
This plugin allows to en/decrypt data on the fly as it is
written out by dd_rescue. It supports a variance of AES
ciphers and uses the hardware acceleration on x86 (AESNI)
and <br>
ARMv8 -- if available -- to provide good performance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This plugin has been written for
dd_rescue and uses the plugin interface from it. See the
dd_rescue(1) man page for more information on dd_rescue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Options are passed using dd_rescue option passing syntax:
The name of the plugin (crypt) is followed by an equal sign
(=) and options are separated by a colon (:). the crypt <br>
plugin also allows for some options to be abbreviated. At
least encryption or decryption and a way to determine the
key (and IV) needs to be passed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Help <br>
Pass help to have ddr_crypt output a short list of
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Encryption or Decryption <br>
The crypt dd_rescue plugin (subsequently referred to as just
ddr_crypt which reflects the variable parts of the file name
libddr_crypt.so) need to be told whether to encrypt or <br>
decrypt. This is done by specifying enc[rypt] or dec[rypt]
parameters on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">De/encryption algorithm <br>
The crypt plugin supports a number of the de/encryption
variants of AES. You can specify which one you want to use
by passing</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">algo=AESxxx-yyy, <br>
where xxx can be 128, 192, 256, 128+, 192+, 256+, 128x2,
192x2, or 256x2, and yyy can be ECB, CBC, or CTR. Pass
algo=help to get a list of available algorithms. See section
<br>
ALGORITHMS AND STREAM MODES for a discussion of the options.
Note that decrypting a file can only be successful if the
exact same algorithms is chosen as was used for <br>
encryption. There is no way to tell from an encrypted file
which algorithm has been chosen. <br>
The default (AES192-CTR) is a good choice if you can ensure
that the key/IV combination is NEVER reused.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Crypto engine <br>
There are several implementations of the AES algorithms that
this plugin can currently use:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">engine=aesni <br>
This will use an own AES implementation using the AESNI
instructions of the intel x86 core CPUs since Westmere. If
possible, this should be used, as it provides both superior
<br>
performance and avoids some of the cache timing attacks that
the lookup tables used in discrete implementations may be
prone to. This engine supports all algorithms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">engine=aesarm64 <br>
This will use an own AES implementation using the AESv8
crypto extensions of the ARMv8 (AArch64 = ARM 64bit)
architecture (available on CPUs/SOCs based on ARM&rsquo;s
Cortex <br>
A53,A57,A72 or Qualcomm&rsquo;s Kryo or Apple&rsquo;s A7x or
newer designs). If possible, this should be used, as it
provides both superior performance and avoids some of the
cache <br>
timing attacks that the lookup tables used in discrete
implementations may be prone to. This engine supports all
algorithms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">engine=aes_c <br>
This uses an AES implementation in C which is based on the
rijndael reference code. It is available on all CPUs and
supports all algorithms. Some prefetching is done on the
<br>
tables to make cache timing attacks a bit harder, but this
is most likely insufficient to thwart sophisticated
attackers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">engine=openssl <br>
This uses the openssl library to implement the AES routines,
which should take advantage of hardware acceleration where
available and have received some hardening against <br>
attacks. Note that the openssl implementation does not
support the + variants (increased number of rounds) that the
other engines provide.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The engines are used in this
order if available, which means that aesni will be used by
default on x86 if supported, aesarm64 will be used on ARMv8
and aes_c by default on all <br>
other platforms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Padding <br>
As AES is a block cipher (with a block size of 16 bytes),
files which are not a multiple of the block size need
padding at the end to have a full block.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pad=zero <br>
The last block is filled up with zeroes and then encrypted.
Note that on decryption, these zeroes can&rsquo;t be
automatically stripped, as the decryptor has no way to tell
<br>
whether there are true trailing zeros or whether those had
been added by padding. This option is thus not recommended
for copying files of arbitrary length.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pad=always <br>
This uses the PKCS7 scheme used by openssl, appending one to
sixteen bytes with the number of bytes to discard when
decrypting. This is always safe, but always makes the <br>
output file larger than the input file. Use this when
copying files. This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pad=asneeded <br>
This is a hybrid between zero and always. This does PKCS7
padding when the file size does not fill a complete block,
but does no padding when it does. This mechanism has in <br>
the worst case (no pad bytes) a chance of 1/255 to produce
an incorrect decryption result by wrong unpadding (which
means that it has an overall chance of misrepresenting the
<br>
final file size of 1/4080 for arbitrary file sizes).
Don&rsquo;t use this unless you can deal with such errors
(or exclude them)!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the CTR stream mode
does NOT require padding and indeed ddr_crypt does not apply
any padding regardless of the pad option when it is
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Debugging and Benchmarking <br>
The debug parameter makes the ddr_crypt module output some
debugging information. With outkeyiv the key and IV will be
output. The benchmark parameter will result in reporting
<br>
the en/decryption speed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Setting key and IV <br>
There are many ways to set the key and IV (for -CBC and -CTR
stream modes).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Setting directly <br>
They can be set directly using keyhex= and ivhex= on the
command line. The argument is interpreted as a hex ASCII
representation of the key/IV (without leading 0x). This way
to <br>
specify keys/IVs should only be used for testing - the key
will be visible to all local users by looking at the command
line (unless specific measures are taken to lock down <br>
access to /proc). Not normally a good idea on a multi-user
system. ddr_crypt does overwrite the sensitive data with X
to make the attack a bit harder, but this still leaks the
<br>
length and -- more importantly -- there is still a time
window where the sensitive data is visible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Reading from file of file
descriptor <br>
It&rsquo;s better to pass in the key and IV via a file
descriptor via keyfd= and ivfd= . If the integer is preceded
by an x, the key/IV will be read as hex string, otherwise
binary <br>
data will be used. Optionally, @OFF@LEN can be appended,
designating the offset and length (in bytes) to be read in
the file passed via the file descriptor. Note that a file
<br>
descriptor of 0 without shell redirection will result in an
interactive prompt to the user and the answer won&rsquo;t be
echoed to the screen of course. <br>
This is useful mainly when dd_rescue is called from another
program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alternatively, with keyfile= and
ivfile= a file name to be opened and read from can be
specified. The syntax does support the same optional
@OFF@LEN designation, but the key and <br>
IV will always be read in binary form. (See below, Index
files for a way to read in hex form.) Currently (unlike with
salt) there is no way to use ddr_crypt to write out binary
<br>
key and IV data with these options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Generating random key and IV
<br>
The Operating System&rsquo;s random number generator can be
used to generate key and IV on the fly; if your system
offers good random numbers, this is the most secure way to
specify <br>
and encryption key. The options to specify are keygen and
ivgen . You need to save the key/IV somehow, otherwise you
can not decrypt again later. (The program will warn you!)
<br>
Best way is to use the next options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Index files <br>
Keys and IVs can be stored as hex strings in index files;
the file format is the same as the one used in MD5SUMS: The
hex representation of the key/IV is followed by the file
<br>
name. Obviously, appropriate care needs to be taken to keep
those files confidential.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the ddr_crypt plugin gets the
option keysfile and ivsfile it will store already created
keys/IVs (from the other options) to files names
KEYS.algname and IVS.algname in the <br>
MD5SUMS format. (The files will be created or updated
accordingly.) If key/IV have not been created yet, ddr_crypt
will try to retrieve the key/IV from those files and error
<br>
out upon failure. <br>
These options combine well with keygen and ivgen on
encryption (and should be used alone on decryption).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Extended attributes <br>
Similar to index files, keys and IVs can also be stored in
and retrieved from the encrypted file&rsquo;s extended
attributes. This can be achieved using the options keyxattr
and <br>
ivxattr . Please review the comments in the main dd_rescue
(1) man page for general considerations about using extended
attributes (xattrs). <br>
Note that storing the key in the xattr is normally not a
good idea. A user who can access the encrypted file can
(locally) also read the xattrs -- so the secrecy normally
<br>
achieved by encryption is defeated this way. (There may be
valid scenarios, though, e.g. when the file tself is only
accessible via a remote protocol that does not expose the
<br>
xattrs, such as http or DAV or NFS.) <br>
You can specify kxfallb[ack] and ixfallb[ack] in addition if
you want ddr_crypt to try using xattrs and falling back to
keysfile and ivsfile in case the file system does not <br>
support the extended attributes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Password based key and IV
generation <br>
Using the same key/IV for many files harms security severely
(see below in ALGORITHMS). So using a directly specified
(non-generated) key is not a good idea. However, if you <br>
prefer to have something memorable rather than stored, you
can use a password and salt to generate many keys from one
password.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The key and IV are derived from
an expensive to compute (and even more expensive to revert)
function of password and salt. By default, ddr_crypt uses
17000 rounds of pbkdf2() <br>
for the key (and a third for the IV), although a more
compute intense function (like scrypt) is planned for the
future. The expensiveness of this function is a protection
against <br>
brute forcing passwords. To use pbkdf2, you need to specify
pbkdf2 or pbkdf2=rounds . The latter format allows
overriding the number of iterations for key generation. (IV
<br>
generation will be done with a third again.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For compatibility with openssl,
key and IV can also be derived using an openssl compatible
key derivation function with opbkdf . Note that this is not
recommended; only one <br>
round of md5 hashing is used which makes brute-forcing very
effective. Using this option also has the side-effect of
writing (encryption) or parsing (decryption) an openSSL
style <br>
Salted__ header.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The salt can be derived
automatically from the name (and length) of the encrypted
file; this allows to work with just one password to be
memorized. However, be aware that file <br>
size or name changes will result in a different salt and
thus different key/IV which render your encrypted file
undecryptable. If there is a risk of this to happen, rather
<br>
memorize one salt per file (or better save key and IV using
keysfile and ivsfile options or save the salt using
saltsfile or saltxattr, see below). Remember that file names
are <br>
case sensitive (as always with Un*x). Of course the keysfile
needs to be well protected from being read by unauthorized
persons.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Password and salt can be
specified with a string pass= and salt= or using the passfd=
passfile= and salthex= saltfd= saltfile= options with the
same possible parameters as above <br>
for direct specification of key and IV. (Note that the salt
is hashed, like when derived from file name and length.) The
password/passphrase is treated as a string, null- <br>
terminated and with a trailing CRLF stripped off. <br>
The warnings about passing confidential data (here: pass,
salt, salthex) on the command line apply -- only do it for
testing or in a single-user environment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the file name based automatic
salt derivation is used, the assumed file length for salt
generation can be overridden by saltlen= .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alternatively, the salts can
also be stored and retrieved from an MD5SUMS style index
file (like with keysfile and ivsfile) by specifying the
option saltsfile . When saltsfile <br>
is used to store salts, using random salts on encryption
becomes a good idea. This can be achieved by specifying the
saltgen option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Instead of a salt index file
(saltsfile), the salt can also be stored in (and retrieved
from) an extended attribute. This can be done using the
saltxattr[=xattr_name] option. The <br>
attribute name is optional and defaults to user.salt.ALGNAME
(with ALGNAME replaced by the algorithm). Since ddr_crypt
1.99, the password-based key derivation function (and the
<br>
number of iterations) is also stored and retrieved in the
xattr user.pbkdf with this option. <br>
It&rsquo;s also possible to try using the xattr feature and
fall back to using the index file (saltsfile) if your file
system does not support extended attributes. Use the
sxfallback <br>
option to tell ddr_crypt to do this. Note that the pbkdf can
not be stored (or retrieved) if the fallback actually takes
place. <br>
See the main dd_rescue (1) man page for a discussion of
advantages and disadvantages of using extended
attributes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ALGORITHMS AND STREAM MODES <br>
The AES (Rijndael) family of algorithms is considered
cryptographically safe at the time of writing, as no
practicable attacks have been published against it. It is up
to the <br>
reader to judge whether (s)he believes that the worst
criminals or intelligence agencies are significantly ahead
of common (published) knowledge. In reality, it is typically
<br>
easier to use social engineering or flaws in key handling
and random number generation to carry out attacks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Plus modes <br>
Given that the best known attacks are against AES versions
with a reduced number of rounds with only small round number
reductions, it appears that increasing the number of <br>
rounds would seem a reasonable countermeasure against
cryptographic attacks. (This has been inspired by a comment
from Bruce Schneier who the author of this document has very
<br>
high respect for.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The C and AESNI implementations
support AES128,192,256 modes with 2,3,4 additional rounds
respectively, resulting in 12, 15, 18 rounds. These modes
are named AES128+, AES192+, <br>
and AES256+ (plus modes) respectively. They do offer a
computationally relatively cheap way to enhance security.
The author of this document e.g. would chose AES192+ over
<br>
AES256. While the author of this document would never judge
himself as a cryptography expert strong enough to create new
algorithms or even devise significant changes to existing
<br>
ones, he considers this variation a choice that is more
secure than the original. Please note however, that these
custom algorithms result in files that can not be decrypted
<br>
using any other tools. Also, the openSSL engine does not
support the plus modes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Double modes <br>
A computationally more expensive method to enhance security
is doubling the number of rounds. This is equivalent to
encrypting twice (where the second key is a simple
derivation <br>
of the first). These methods are supported by all engines
and are named AES128x2, AES192x2, and AES256x2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Stream modes <br>
The AES algorithm is a block cipher -- it transforms 16 byte
blocks. The trivial application to a file of arbitrary size
is to apply this to every block in the file. This is <br>
called ECB (electronic codebook) mode. This is very insecure
... the same input will always result in the same output.
Patterns can be easily recognized and known plain text <br>
attacks are trivial.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It&rsquo;s better to make the
transformation dependent on the previous content of the file
or the position within it. This is what the CBC (chained
block cipher) and CTR modes do.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The CBC mode has several
disadvantages: It can&rsquo;t be parallelized (every block
depends on all previous blocks for encryption; things are
better for decryption) and random access <br>
is impossible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The CTR mode has many desirable
properties. It is basically a stream of (reproducible)
pseudo random numbers that are XORed with the input for
encryption. Decryption is just <br>
another XOR of course. It&rsquo;s a one time pad -- which
has been proven to be secure, if the pad is unknown to an
attacker and only used once. <br>
The latter can&rsquo;t be stressed enough: Don&rsquo;t ever
use the same key/IV combination for two files.
Mathematically spoken: c1 = r1 XOR p1 and c2 = r2 XOR p2 (c
= ciphertext, r = AES <br>
random numbers, p = plaintext). With r == r1 == r2, it can
be trivially seen that the attacker can calculate c1 XOR c2
= r XOR p1 XOR r XOR p2 = p1 XOR p2. If the plaintext of
<br>
one of the files is partially known, so is the other.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The CTR mode has more nice
properties: It allows random access as the AES random
numbers (belonging to a key/IV combination) with a certain
offset can be directly calculated and <br>
the last block does not require padding, as partial blocks
can be processed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The author of this documents
prefers CTR stream mode and ensures that keys/IVs are not
reused.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Supported dd_rescue features
<br>
With CTR mode, you can do partial writes to encrypted files
and the result will still be a consistent file (of course
assuming that the used key and IV are the same). Same with
<br>
appending (-x) or reverse direction copies. <br>
With ECB mode, this will only work, if file size and offsets
are all block (16byte) aligned. With CBC, none of this is
possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ddr_crypt plugin has no
specific support for encoding holes; if however previous
correctly encrypted content is present in a hole, the
support for partial writes in CTR and <br>
ECB mode will result in a meaningful output. If no previous
content is in holes, then the result of decrypting zeros
will result upon decryption. <br>
You can pass the option skiphole to make ddr_crypt leave
512byte blocks of zeros untouched. This will reveal blocks
of zeros and may thus disclose valuable information to an
<br>
attacker, so use with care. Also note that you need to use
this with en- and decryption and with the same alignment
(mod 512) for encryption to be reversible. You have been
<br>
warned. (You don&rsquo;t need to be worried about
misdetecting zeros on decrypting -- the chances of non-zero
plaintext resulting in an aligned 512byte block of zeros is
smaller than <br>
2^-4096. So this option is safe on decrypting -- if some of
the ciphertext has been overwritten with blocks of zeros,
you might even prefer to have zeros in the decrypted file
<br>
rather than random gibberish.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that you can compress and
encode holes with ddr_lzo and then pass to ddr_crypt to
encrypt and pass through ddr_crypt to decrypt and ddr_lzo to
uncompress and extract holes <br>
again. This only works with CTR mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The option weakrnd is provided
for testing in environments, where strong random numbers are
not available. It will cause weaker random numbers to be
used for key generation. <br>
Don&rsquo;t use it if you want security.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">openssl compatibility <br>
Files that are encrypted with openssl enc where you specify
the key (with -K) and the IV (with -iv) result in the same
output that ddr_crypt generates for -ECB and -CBC modes.
<br>
ddr_crypt uses a 64bit counter in -CTR modes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With the option opbkdf ddr_crypt
also reads/writes the openSSL Salted__ header to be
compatible with openssl. This function needs more testing
and better error handling though.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS/LIMITATIONS <br>
Maturity <br>
The plugin is new as of dd_rescue 1.98. Do not yet rely on
data saved with ddr_crypt as the only backup for valuable
data. Also expect some changes to ddr_crypt in the not too
<br>
distant future.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Due to an issue in
ddr_crypt&rsquo;s initialization of the IV for CTR mode, the
last 32bits would always be zeroed out prior to adding the
counter. This has been fixed in 1.99. It <br>
order to be compatible with 1.98, the option ctrbug198 can
be specified on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Security <br>
While care has been applied to check the result of memory
allocations ..., the code has not been audited and only
limited fuzzing has been applied to ensure it&rsquo;s not
vulnerable <br>
to malicious data -- be careful when you process data from
untrusted sources. <br>
Key handling is a tricky business -- the author may have
screwed up resulting in some ways to use this program to
encrypt data may not result in the level of secrecy that is
<br>
desired.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Testing <br>
The crypt plugin does not yet have the same test coverage as
the other plugins, which means it has not been tested as
intensively as the others.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Future work <br>
Except for more testing and auditing a few more features are
envisioned for this plugin: <br>
Support for other (non-AES) algorithms such as twofish (and
possibly also threefish). <br>
Stronger function to derive keys/IVs from passwords than
pbkdf2. <br>
Support for other streaming modes (XTS, GCM, ...)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
