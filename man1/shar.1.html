<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
shar - create a shell archive</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
shar [-flag [value]]... [--opt-name[[=| ]value]]... [file
...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no files are specified, the
list of input files is read from a standard input. Standard
input must not be a terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
shar creates &quot;shell archives&quot; (or shar files)
which are in text format and can be emailed. These files may
be unpacked later by executing them with /bin/sh. The
resulting ar&acirc; <br>
chive is sent to standard out unless the -o option is given.
A wide range of features provide extensive flexibility in
manufacturing shars and in specifying shar
&quot;smartness&quot;. <br>
Archives may be fairly simple (--vanilla-operation) or
essentially a mailable tar archive. Options may be specified
in any order until a file argument is recognized. If the
<br>
--intermix-type option has been specified, more compression
and encoding options will be recognized between the file
arguments. Though this program supports uuencode-d files,
<br>
they are deprecated. If you are emailing files, please
consider mime-encoded files. If you do uuencode, base 64 is
the preferred encoding method.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
specifying compression <br>
-p, --intermix-type <br>
specify compression for input files. This option must not
appear in combination with any of the following options:
vanilla-operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Allow positional parameter
options. The compression method and encoding method options
may be intermixed with file names. Files named after these
options will be pro&acirc; <br>
cessed in the specified way.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C program, --compactor=program
<br>
specify compaction (compression) program. This option may
appear an unlimited number of times. This option must not
appear in combination with any of the following <br>
options: vanilla-operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The gzip, bzip2 and compress
compactor commands may be specified by the program name as
the option name, e.g. --gzip. Those options, however, are
being deprecated. There <br>
is also the xz compactor now. Specify xz with -C xz or
--compactor=xz.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specifying the compactor
&quot;none&quot; will then disable file compression, even
for non-text files. Any other compactor will force
uuencoding of files, and the recipient must <br>
have uudecode to unpack the archive. (Compressed files are
never processed as plain text.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specifying the compactor
compress is deprecated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g level,
--level-of-compression=level <br>
pass LEVEL for compression. This option takes an integer
number as its argument. The value of level is constrained to
being: <br>
in the range 1 through 9 <br>
The default level for this option is: <br>
9</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some compression programs allow
for a level of compression. The default is 9, but this
option allows you to specify something else. This value is
used by gzip, bzip2 and <br>
xz, but not compress.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-j, --bzip2 <br>
bzip2 and uuencode files. This option may appear an
unlimited number of times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bzip2 compress and uuencode all
files prior to packing. The recipient must have uudecode
bzip2 in order to unpack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: THIS OPTION IS
DEPRECATED</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z, --gzip <br>
gzip and uuencode files. This option may appear an unlimited
number of times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gzip compress and uuencode all
files prior to packing. The recipient must have uudecode and
gzip in order to unpack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: THIS OPTION IS
DEPRECATED</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Z, --compress <br>
compress and uuencode files. This option may appear an
unlimited number of times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">compress and uuencode all files
prior to packing. The recipient must have uudecode and
compress in order to unpack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: THIS OPTION IS
DEPRECATED</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--level-for-gzip <br>
This is an alias for the --level-of-compression option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: THIS OPTION IS
DEPRECATED</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b bits, --bits-per-code=bits
<br>
pass bits (default 12) to compress. The default bits for
this option is: <br>
12</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is the compression factor
used by the compress program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: THIS OPTION IS
DEPRECATED</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">specifying file encoding
methodology <br>
Files may be stored in the shar either as plain text or
uuencoded. By default, the program selects which by
examining the file. You may force the selection for all
files. In <br>
intermixed option/file mode, this setting may be changed
during processing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M, --mixed-uuencode <br>
decide uuencoding for each file. This option is a member of
the mixed-uuencode class of options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Automatically determine if the
files are text or binary and archive correctly. Files found
to be binary are uuencoded prior to packing. This is the
default behavior for <br>
shar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For a file to be considered a
text file instead of a binary file, all the following should
be true:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The file does not contain any
ASCII control character besides BS (backspace), HT
(horizontal tab), LF (new line) or FF (form feed).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The file contains no character
with its eighth-bit set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The file contains no line
beginning with the five letters &quot;from &quot;,
capitalized or not. (Mail handling programs will often
gratuitously insert a &gt; character before it.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The file is either empty or ends
with a LF (newline) byte.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">No line in the file contains
more than 200 characters. For counting purpose, lines are
separated by a LF (newline).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B, --uuencode <br>
treat all files as binary. This option is a member of the
mixed-uuencode class of options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use uuencode prior to packing
all files. This increases the size of the archive. The
recipient must have uudecode in order to unpack. Compressed
files are always <br>
encoded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T, --text-files <br>
treat all files as text. This option is a member of the
mixed-uuencode class of options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you have files with non-ascii
bytes or text that some mail handling programs do not like,
you may find difficulties. However, if you are using FTP or
SSH/SCP, the non- <br>
conforming text files should be okay.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">specifying file selection and
output modes <br>
-o prefix, --output-prefix=prefix <br>
print output to file PREFIX.nn.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Save the archive to files
prefix.01 thru prefix.nn instead of sending all output to
standard out. Must be specified when the --whole-size-limit
or --split-size-limit <br>
options are specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When prefix contains a %
character, prefix is then interpreted as a sprintf format,
which should be able to display a single decimal number.
When prefix does not contain <br>
such a % character, the string .%02d is internally
appended.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l size, --whole-size-limit=size
<br>
split archive, not files, to size. This option is a member
of the whole-size-limit class of options. This option must
appear in combination with the following options: <br>
output-prefix. This option takes an integer number as its
argument. The value of size is constrained to being: <br>
in the range 8 through 1023, or <br>
in the range 8192 through 4194304</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Limit the output file size to
size bytes, but don&rsquo;t split input files. If size is
less than 1024, then it will be multiplied by 1024. The
value may also be specified <br>
with a k, K, m or M suffix. The number is then multiplied by
1000, 1024, 1000000, or 1048576, respectively. 4M (4194304)
is the maximum allowed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unlike the split-size-limit
option, this allows the recipient of the shell archives to
be unpacked in any order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L size, --split-size-limit=size
<br>
split archive or files to size. This option is a member of
the whole-size-limit class of options. This option must
appear in combination with the following options: out&acirc;
<br>
put-prefix. This option takes an integer number as its
argument. The value of size is constrained to being: <br>
in the range 8 through 1023, or <br>
in the range 8192 through 4194304</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Limit output file size to size
bytes, splitting files if necessary. The allowed values are
specified as with the --whole-size-limit option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The archive parts created with
this option must be unpacked in the correct order. If the
recipient of the shell archives wants to put all of them in
a single email folder <br>
(file), they will have to be saved in the correct order for
unshar to unpack them all at once (using one of the split
archive options). see: unshar Invocation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I file, --input-file-list=file
<br>
read file list from a file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option causes file to be
reopened as standard input. If no files are found on the
input line, then standard input is read for input file
names. Use of this option <br>
will prohibit input files from being listed on the command
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Input must be in a form similar
to that generated by find, one filename per line. This
switch is especially useful when the command line will not
hold the list of files <br>
to be archived.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the --intermix-type option is
specified on the command line, then the compression options
may be included in the standard input on lines by themselves
and no file name <br>
may begin with a hyphen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example: <br>
{ echo --compact xz <br>
find . -type f -print | sort <br>
} | shar -S -p -L50K -o /somewhere/big</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S, --stdin-file-list <br>
read file list from standard input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is actually a no-op.
It is a wrapper for --input-file-list=-.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: THIS OPTION IS
DEPRECATED</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Controlling the shar headers
<br>
-n name, --archive-name=name <br>
use name to document the archive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Name of archive to be included
in the subject header of the shar files. See the
--net-headers option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s who@where,
--submitter=who@where <br>
override the submitter name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">shar will normally determine the
submitter name by querying the system. Use this option if it
is being done on behalf of another.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a, --net-headers <br>
output Submitted-by: &amp; Archive-name: headers. This
option must appear in combination with the following
options: archive-name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Adds specialized email headers:
<br>
Submitted-by: who@@where <br>
Archive-name: name/part## <br>
The who@@where is normally derived, but can be specified
with the --submitter option. The name must be provided with
the --archive-name option. If the archive name <br>
includes a slash (/) character, then the /part## is omitted.
Thus -n xyzzy produces: <br>
xyzzy/part01 <br>
xyzzy/part02</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">while -n xyzzy/patch produces:
<br>
xyzzy/patch01 <br>
xyzzy/patch02</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and -n xyzzy/patch01. produces:
<br>
xyzzy/patch01.01 <br>
xyzzy/patch01.02</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --cut-mark <br>
start the shar with a cut line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A line saying &rsquo;Cut
here&rsquo; is placed at the start of each output file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t, --translate <br>
translate messages in the script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Translate messages in the
script. If you have set the LANG environment variable,
messages printed by shar will be in the specified language.
The produced script will <br>
still be emitted using messages in the lingua franca of the
computer world: English. This option will cause the script
messages to appear in the languages specified by <br>
the LANG environment variable set when the script is
produced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Protecting against transmission
issues: <br>
--no-character-count <br>
do not use &lsquo;wc -c&rsquo; to check size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Do NOT check each file with
&rsquo;wc -c&rsquo; after unpack. The default is to
check.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D, --no-md5-digest <br>
do not use md5sum digest to verify.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Do not use md5sum digest to
verify the unpacked files. The default is to check.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F, --force-prefix <br>
apply the prefix character on every line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Forces the prefix character to
be prepended to every line, even if not required. This
option may slightly increase the size of the archive,
especially if --uuencode or a <br>
compression option is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d delim, --here-delimiter=delim
<br>
use delim to delimit the files. The default delim for this
option is: <br>
SHAR_EOF</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use DELIM to delimit the files
in the shar instead of SHAR_EOF. This is for those who want
to personalize their shar files. The delimiter will always
be prefixed and <br>
suffixed with underscores.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Producing different kinds of
shars: <br>
-V, --vanilla-operation <br>
produce very simple shars.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option produces vanilla
shars which rely only upon the existence of echo, test and
sed in the unpacking environment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It changes the default behavior
from mixed mode (--mixed-uuencode) to text mode
(--text-files). Warnings are produced if options are
specified that will require decom&acirc; <br>
pression or decoding in the unpacking environment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P, --no-piping <br>
use temporary files between programs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the shar file, use a
temporary file to hold file contents between unpacking
stages instead of using pipes. This option is mandatory when
you know the unpacking will <br>
happen on systems that do not support pipes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x, --no-check-existing <br>
blindly overwrite existing files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Create the archive so that when
processed it will overwrite existing files without checking
first. If neither this option nor the --query-user option is
specified, the <br>
unpack will not overwrite pre-existing files. In all cases,
however, if --cut-mark is passed as a parameter to the
script when unpacking, then existing files will be <br>
overwritten unconditionally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sh shar-archive-file -c</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X, --query-user <br>
ask user before overwriting files. This option must not
appear in combination with any of the following options:
vanilla-operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When unpacking, interactively
ask the user if files should be overwritten. Do not use for
shars submitted to the net.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use of this option produces
shars which will cause problems with some unshar-style
procedures, particularily when used together with vanilla
mode (--vanilla-operation). <br>
Use this feature mainly for archives to be passed among
agreeable parties. Certainly, -X is not for shell archives
which are to be submitted to Usenet or other public <br>
networks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The problem is that unshar
programs or procedures often feed /bin/sh from its standard
input, thus putting /bin/sh and the shell archive script in
competition for input <br>
lines. As an attempt to alleviate this problem, shar will
try to detect if /dev/tty exists at the receiving site and
will use it to read user replies. But this does not <br>
work in all cases, it may happen that the receiving user
will have to avoid using unshar programs or procedures, and
call /bin/sh directly. In vanilla mode, using <br>
/dev/tty is not even attempted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m, --no-timestamp <br>
do not restore modification times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Avoid generating
&rsquo;touch&rsquo; commands to restore the file
modification dates when unpacking files from the
archive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When file modification times are
not preserved, project build programs like &quot;make&quot;
will see built files older than the files they get built
from. This is why, when this <br>
option is not used, a special effort is made to restore
timestamps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Q, --quiet-unshar <br>
avoid verbose messages at unshar time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Verbose OFF. Disables the
inclusion of comments to be output when the archive is
unpacked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, --basename <br>
restore in one directory, despite hierarchy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Restore by the base file name
only, rather than path. This option causes only file names
to be used, which is useful when building a shar from
several directories, or <br>
another directory. Note that if a directory name is passed
to shar, the substructure of that directory will be restored
whether this option is specified or not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Internationalization options:
<br>
--no-i18n <br>
do not internationalize.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Do not produce internationalized
shell archives, use default English messages. By default,
shar produces archives that will try to output messages in
the unpackers pre&acirc; <br>
ferred language (as determined by the LANG/LC_MESSAGES
environmental variables) when they are unpacked. If no
message file for the unpackers language is found at unpack
<br>
time, messages will be in English.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--print-text-domain-dir <br>
print directory with shar messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Prints the directory shar looks
in to find messages files for different languages, then
immediately exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">user feedback/entertainment <br>
-q, --quiet <br>
do not output verbose messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">omit progress messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--silent <br>
This is an alias for the --quiet option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Display usage information and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-!, --more-help <br>
Pass the extended usage information through a pager.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R [rcfile],
--save-opts[=rcfile] <br>
Save the option state to rcfile. The default is the last
configuration file listed in the OPTION PRESETS section,
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r rcfile, --load-opts=rcfile,
--no-load-opts <br>
Load options from rcfile. The no-load-opts form will disable
the loading of earlier RC/INI files. --no-load-opts is
handled early, out of order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v [{v|c|n}],
--version[={v|c|n}] <br>
Output version of program and exit. The default mode is
&lsquo;v&rsquo;, a simple version. The &lsquo;c&rsquo; mode
will print copyright information and &lsquo;n&rsquo; will
print the full copyright <br>
notice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTION PRESETS <br>
Any option that is not marked as not presettable may be
preset by loading values from configuration (&quot;RC&quot;
or &quot;.INI&quot;) file(s). The file
&quot;$HOME/.sharrc&quot; will be used, if present.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WARNINGS <br>
No attempt is made to restore the protection and
modification dates for directories, even if this is done by
default for files. Thus, if a directory is given to shar,
the pro&acirc; <br>
tection and modification dates of corresponding unpacked
directory may not match those of the original.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a directory is passed to
shar, it may be scanned more than once, to conserve memory.
Therefore, do not change the directory contents while shar
is running.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Be careful that the output
file(s) are not included in the inputs or shar may loop
until the disk fills up. Be particularly careful when a
directory is passed to shar that the <br>
output files are not in that directory or a subdirectory of
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use of the compression and
encoding options will slow the archive process, perhaps
considerably.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use of the --query-user produces
shars which will cause problems with many unshar procedures.
Use this feature only for archives to be passed among
agreeable parties. Cer&acirc; <br>
tainly, query-user is NOT for shell archives which are to be
distributed across the net. The use of compression in net
shars will cause you to be flamed off the earth. Not <br>
using the --no-timestamp or --force-prefix options may also
get you occasional complaints. Put these options into your
~/.sharrc file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
See OPTION PRESETS for configuration files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
The first shows how to make a shell archive out of all C
program sources. The second produces a shell archive with
all .c and .h files, which unpacks silently. The third gives
<br>
a shell archive of all uuencoded .arc files, into numbered
files starting from arc.sh.01. The last example gives a
shell archive which will use only the file names at unpack
<br>
time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">shar *.c &gt; cprog.shar <br>
shar -Q *.[ch] &gt; cprog.shar <br>
shar -B -l28 -oarc.sh *.arc <br>
shar -f /lcl/src/u*.c &gt; u.sh</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
One of the following exit values will be returned:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 (EXIT_SUCCESS) <br>
Successful program execution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 (EXIT_OPTION_ERROR) <br>
