<p>GCCGO(1) GNU GCCGO(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
gccgo - A GCC-based compiler for the Go language</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
gccgo [-c|-S] <br>
[-g] [-pg] [-Olevel] <br>
[-Idir...] [-Ldir...] <br>
[-o outfile] infile...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Only the most useful options are
listed here; see below for the remainder.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The gccgo command is a frontend to gcc and supports many of
the same options. This manual only documents the options
specific to gccgo.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The gccgo command may be used to
compile Go source code into an object file, link a
collection of object files together, or do both in
sequence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Go source code is compiled as
packages. A package consists of one or more Go source files.
All the files in a single package must be compiled together,
by passing all the files <br>
as arguments to gccgo. A single invocation of gccgo may only
compile a single package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One Go package may
&quot;import&quot; a different Go package. The imported
package must have already been compiled; gccgo will read the
import data directly from the compiled package. <br>
When this package is later linked, the compiled form of the
package must be included in the link command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Go programs must generally be
compiled with debugging information, and -g1 is the default
as described below. Stripping a Go program will generally
cause it to misbehave or <br>
fail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-Idir <br>
Specify a directory to use when searching for an import
package at compile time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Ldir <br>
When linking, specify a library search directory, as with
gcc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fgo-pkgpath=string <br>
Set the package path to use. This sets the value returned by
the PkgPath method of reflect.Type objects. It is also used
for the names of globally visible symbols. The <br>
argument to this option should normally be the string that
will be used to import this package after it has been
installed; in other words, a pathname within the directories
<br>
specified by the -I option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fgo-prefix=string <br>
An alternative to -fgo-pkgpath. The argument will be
combined with the package name from the source file to
produce the package path. If -fgo-pkgpath is used,
-fgo-prefix <br>
will be ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Go permits a single program to
include more than one package with the same name in the
&quot;package&quot; clause in the source file, though
obviously the two packages must be imported <br>
using different pathnames. In order for this to work with
gccgo, either -fgo-pkgpath or -fgo-prefix must be specified
when compiling a package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using either -fgo-pkgpath or
-fgo-prefix disables the special treatment of the
&quot;main&quot; package and permits that package to be
imported like any other.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fgo-relative-import-path=dir
<br>
A relative import is an import that starts with ./ or ../.
If this option is used, gccgo will use dir as a prefix for
the relative import when searching for it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-frequire-return-statement <br>
-fno-require-return-statement <br>
By default gccgo will warn about functions which have one or
more return parameters but lack an explicit
&quot;return&quot; statement. This warning may be disabled
using <br>
-fno-require-return-statement.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fgo-check-divide-zero <br>
Add explicit checks for division by zero. In Go a division
(or modulos) by zero causes a panic. On Unix systems this is
detected in the runtime by catching the &quot;SIGFPE&quot;
<br>
signal. Some processors, such as PowerPC, do not generate a
SIGFPE on division by zero. Some runtimes do not generate a
signal that can be caught. On those systems, this <br>
option may be used. Or the checks may be removed via
-fno-go-check-divide-zero. This option is currently on by
default, but in the future may be off by default on systems
<br>
that do not require it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fgo-check-divide-overflow <br>
Add explicit checks for division overflow. For example,
division overflow occurs when computing &quot;INT_MIN /
-1&quot;. In Go this should be wrapped, to produce
&quot;INT_MIN&quot;. Some <br>
processors, such as x86, generate a trap on division
overflow. On those systems, this option may be used. Or the
checks may be removed via -fno-go-check-divide-overflow.
<br>
This option is currently on by default, but in the future
may be off by default on systems that do not require it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g This is the standard gcc
option. It is mentioned here because by default gccgo turns
on debugging information generation with the equivalent of
the standard option -g1. <br>
This is because Go programs require debugging information to
be available in order to get backtrace information. An
explicit -g0 may be used to disable the generation of <br>
debugging information, in which case certain standard
library functions, such as &quot;runtime.Callers&quot;, will
not operate correctly.</p>
