<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
gvrng - An interactive, introductory programming
language.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNTAX <br>
gvrng [world file | program file]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Guido van Robot is a project developed by advanced high
school students for use by their peers as a learning tool
and precursor to the further study of programming with
Python. <br>
It is a minimalistic programming language providing just
enough syntax to help students learn the concepts of
sequencing, conditional branching, looping and procedural
abstrac&acirc; <br>
tion. It&rsquo;s biggest strength is that it permits this
learning in an environment that combines the thrill of
problem-solving with instant visual feedback. In short, it
is an inter&acirc; <br>
active, introductory programming language that is excellent
for learning the basic concepts of programming, applicable
in any high-level language. Best of all, it&rsquo;s a whole
lot <br>
of fun, too!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At this point, you are probably
asking yourself, &quot;What is GvRng, specifically?&quot;
The gist of it is that it is a robot represented by a
triangle on the screen that moves around in <br>
a world made up of streets and avenues, walls and
&quot;beepers&quot;, which Guido can collect or set. His
actions are completely guided by a program written by the
user.</p>
