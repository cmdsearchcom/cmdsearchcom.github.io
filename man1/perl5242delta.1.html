perldelta - what is new for perl v5.24.2
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
This document describes differences between the 5.24.1 release and the 5.24.2
  release.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.24.0, first read
  perl5241delta, which describes differences between 5.24.0 and 5.24.1.

  handling of '.' in @INC in base.pm</a></h2>
The handling of (the removal of) '.' in @INC in base has been improved. This
  resolves some problematic behaviour in the approach taken in Perl 5.24.1,
  which is probably best described in the following two threads on the Perl 5
  Porters mailing list:
  &lt;http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2016/08/msg238991.html&gt;,

  colons and relative paths in PATH</a></h2>
On Unix systems, Perl treats any relative paths in the PATH environment variable
  as tainted when starting a new process. Previously, it was allowing a
  backslash to escape a colon (unlike the OS), consequently allowing relative
  paths to be considered safe if the PATH was set to something like
  &quot;/\:.&quot;. The check has been fixed to treat &quot;.&quot; as tainted
  in that example.

Perl continues to flourish into its third decade thanks to a vibrant community
  of users and developers. The following people are known to have contributed
  the improvements that became Perl 5.24.2:
<div class="Pp"></div>

The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is automatically generated
  from version control history. In particular, it does not include the names of
  the (very much appreciated) contributors who reported issues to the Perl bug
  tracker.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Many of the changes included in this version originated in the CPAN modules
  included in Perl's core. We're grateful to the entire CPAN community for
  helping Perl to flourish.

  the <i>AUTHORS</i> file in the Perl source distribution.

  Bugs</a></h1>
If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently
  posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at
  &lt;https://rt.perl.org/&gt; . There may also be information at
  &lt;http://www.perl.org/&gt; , the Perl Home Page.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug program
  included with your release. Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
  sufficient test case. Your bug report, along with the output of &quot;perl
  -V&quot;, will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl
  porting team.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it
  inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then see
  &quot;SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION&quot; in perlsec for details
  of how to report the issue.
