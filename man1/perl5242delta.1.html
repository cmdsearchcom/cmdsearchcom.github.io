<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
perldelta - what is new for perl v5.24.2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This document describes differences between the 5.24.1
release and the 5.24.2 release.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are upgrading from an
earlier release such as 5.24.0, first read perl5241delta,
which describes differences between 5.24.0 and 5.24.1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Security <br>
Improved handling of &rsquo;.&rsquo; in @INC in base.pm <br>
The handling of (the removal of) &rsquo;.&rsquo; in @INC in
base has been improved. This resolves some problematic
behaviour in the approach taken in Perl 5.24.1, which is
probably best <br>
described in the following two threads on the Perl 5 Porters
mailing list:
&lt;http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2016/08/msg238991.html&gt;,
<br>

&lt;http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2016/10/msg240297.html&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;Escaped&quot; colons and
relative paths in PATH <br>
On Unix systems, Perl treats any relative paths in the PATH
environment variable as tainted when starting a new process.
Previously, it was allowing a backslash to escape a <br>
colon (unlike the OS), consequently allowing relative paths
to be considered safe if the PATH was set to something like
&quot;/.&quot;. The check has been fixed to treat
&quot;.&quot; as tainted <br>
in that example.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Modules and Pragmata <br>
Updated Modules and Pragmata <br>
&Acirc;&middot; base has been upgraded from version 2.23 to
2.23_01.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Module::CoreList
has been upgraded from version 5.20170114_24 to
5.20170715_24.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Selected Bug Fixes <br>
&Acirc;&middot; Fixed a crash with &quot;s///l&quot; where
it thought it was dealing with UTF-8 when it wasn&rsquo;t.

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Acknowledgements <br>
Perl 5.24.2 represents approximately 6 months of development
since Perl 5.24.1 and contains approximately 2,500 lines of
changes across 53 files from 18 authors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Excluding auto-generated files,

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl continues to flourish into
its third decade thanks to a vibrant community of users and
developers. The following people are known to have
contributed the improvements that <br>
became Perl 5.24.2:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Aaron Crane, Abigail, Aristotle
Pagaltzis, Chris &rsquo;BinGOs&rsquo; Williams, Dan Collins,
David Mitchell, Eric Herman, Father Chrysostomos, James E
Keenan, Karl Williamson, Lukas Mai, <br>
Renee Baecker, Ricardo Signes, Sawyer X, Stevan Little,
Steve Hay, Tony Cook, Yves Orton.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The list above is almost
certainly incomplete as it is automatically generated from
version control history. In particular, it does not include
the names of the (very much <br>
appreciated) contributors who reported issues to the Perl
bug tracker.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Many of the changes included in
this version originated in the CPAN modules included in
Perl&rsquo;s core. We&rsquo;re grateful to the entire CPAN
community for helping Perl to flourish.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For a more complete list of all
of Perl&rsquo;s historical contributors, please see the
AUTHORS file in the Perl source distribution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Reporting Bugs <br>
If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the
articles recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc
newsgroup and the perl bug database at
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/&gt; . <br>
There may also be information at
&lt;http://www.perl.org/&gt; , the Perl Home Page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you believe you have an
unreported bug, please run the perlbug program included with
your release. Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case. Your bug <br>
report, along with the output of &quot;perl -V&quot;, will
be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl
porting team.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the bug you are reporting has
security implications which make it inappropriate to send to
a publicly archived mailing list, then see &quot;SECURITY
VULNERABILITY CONTACT <br>
INFORMATION&quot; in perlsec for details of how to report
the issue.</p>
