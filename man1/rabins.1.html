<p>RABINS(1) General Commands Manual RABINS(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
rabins - process argus(8) data within specified bins.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
rabins [-B secs] -M splitmode [options]] [raoptions] [--
filter-expression]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Rabins reads argus data from an argus-data source, and
adjusts the data so that it is aligned to a set of bins, or
slots, that are based on either time, input size, or count.
<br>
The resulting output is split, modified, and optionally
aggregated so that the data fits to the constraints of the
specified bins. rabins is designed to be a combination of
ras&acirc; <br>
plit and racluster, acting on multiple contexts of argus
data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The principal function of rabins
is to align input data to a series of bins, and then process
the data within the context of each bin. This is the basis
for real-time stream <br>
block processing. Time series stream block processing is
cricital for flow data graphing, comparing, analyzing, and
correlation. Fixed load stream block processing, based on
<br>
the number of argus data records (&rsquo;count&rsquo;), or a
fixed volume of data (&rsquo;size&rsquo;) allows for control
of resources in processing. While load based options are
very useful, they are <br>
rather esoteric. See the online examples and rasplit.1 for
examples of using these modes of operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Time Series Bins <br>
Time series bin&rsquo;ing is specified using the -M time
option. Time bins are specified by the size and granularity
of the time bin. The granularity, &rsquo;s&rsquo;econds,
&rsquo;m&rsquo;inutes, &rsquo;h&rsquo;ours, <br>
&rsquo;d&rsquo;ays, &rsquo;w&rsquo;eeks,
&rsquo;M&rsquo;onths, and &rsquo;y&rsquo;ears, dictates
where the bin boundaries lie. To ensure that 0.5d and 12h
start on the same point in time, second, minute, hour, and
day based <br>
bins start at midnight, Jan 1st of the year of processing.
Week, month and year bins all start on natural time
boundaries, for the period.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rabins provides a separate
processing context for each bin, so that aggregation and
sorting occur only within the context of each time period.
Records are placed into bins based <br>
on load or time. For load based bins, input records are
processed in received order and are not modified. When using
time based bins, records are placed into bins based on the
<br>
starting time of the record. By default, records that span a
time boundary are split into as many records as needed to
fit the record into appropriate bin sizes, using the
algo&acirc; <br>
rithms used by rasplit.1. Metrics are distributed uniformly
within all the appropriate bins. The result is a series of
data and/or fragments that are time aligned, appropriate
<br>
for time seried analysis, and visualization.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a record is split to
conform to a time series bin, the resulting starting and
ending timestamps may or may not coincide with the
timestamps of the bins themselves. For some <br>
applications, this treatment is critical to the analytics
that are working on the resulting data, such as transaction
duration, and flow traffic burst behavior. However, for <br>
other analytics, like average load, and rate analysis and
reporting, the timestamps need to be modified so that they
reflect the time range of the actual time bin boundaries.
<br>
Rabins supports the optional hard option to specify that
timestamps should conform to bin boundaries. One of the
results of this is that all durations in the reported
records <br>
will be the bin duration. This is extremely important when
processing certain time series metrics, like load.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Load Based Bins <br>
Load based bin&rsquo;ing is specified using the -M size or
-M count options. Load bins are used to constrain the
resource used in bin processing. So much load is input,
aggregation <br>
is performed on the input load, and when a threshold is
reached, the entire aggregation cache is dumped,
reinitiallized, and reused. These can be used effectively to
provide <br>
realtime data reduction, but within a fixed amount of
memory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Output Processing <br>
rabins has two basic modes of output, the default holds all
output in main memory until EOF is encountered on input,
where each sorted bin is written out. The second output
mode, <br>
has rabins writing out the contents of individual sorted
bins, periodically based on a holding time, specified using
the -B secs option. The secs value should be chosen such
<br>
that rabins will have seen all the appropriate incoming data
for that time period. This is determined by the
ARGUS_FLOW_STATUS_INTERVAL used by the collection of argus
data <br>
sources in the input data stream, as well as any time drift
that may exist amoung argus data processin elements. When
there is good time sync, and with an ARGUS_FLOW_STA&acirc;
<br>
TUS_INTERVAL of 5 seconds, appropriate secs values are
between 5-15 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The output of rabins when using
the -B secs option, is appropriate to drive a number of
processing elements, such as near real-time visualizations
and alarm and reporting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Output Stream <br>
Like all ra.1 client programs, the output of rabins.1 is an
argus data stream, that can be written as binary data to a
file or standard output, or can be printed. rabins
sup&acirc; <br>
ports all the output functions provided by rasplit.1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The output files name consists
of a prefix, which is specified using the -w ra option, and
for all modes except time mode, a suffix, which is created
for each resulting file. If <br>
no prefix is provided, then rabins will use &rsquo;x&rsquo;
as the default prefix. The suffix that is used is determined
by the mode of operation. When rabins is using the default
count <br>
mode or the size mode, the suffix is a group of letters
&rsquo;aa&rsquo;, &rsquo;ab&rsquo;, and so on, such that
concatenating the output files in sorted order by file name
produces the original input <br>
file. If rabins will need to create more output files than
are allowed by the default suffix strategy, more letters
will be added, in order to accomodate the needed files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When rabins is spliting based on
time, rabins uses a default extension of %Y.%m.%d.%h.%m.%s.
This default can be overrided by adding a &rsquo;%&rsquo;
extension to the name provided using <br>
the -w option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When standard out is specified,
using -w -, rabins will output a single argus-stream with
START and STOP argus management records inserted
appropriately to indicate where the <br>
output is split. See argus(8) for more information on output
stream formats.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When rabins is spliting on
output record count (the default), the number of records is
specified as an ordinal counter, the default is 1000
records. When rabins is spliting <br>
based on the maximum output file size, the size is specified
as bytes. The scale of the bytes can be specified by
appending &rsquo;b&rsquo;, &rsquo;k&rsquo; and
&rsquo;m&rsquo; to the number provided.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When rabins is spliting base on
time, the time period is specified with the option, and can
be any period based in seconds (s), minutes (m), hours (h),
days (d), weeks (w), <br>
months (M) or years (y). Rabins will create and modify
records as required to split on prescribed time boundaries.
If any record spans a time boundary, the record is split and
<br>
the metrics are adjusted using a uniform distribution model
to distribute the statistics between the two records.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See rasplit.1 for specifics.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RABINS SPECIFIC OPTIONS <br>
rabins, like all ra based clients, supports a number of ra
options including remote data access, reading from multiple
files and filtering of input argus records through a
termi&acirc; <br>
nating filter expression. Rabins also provides all the
functions of racluster.1 and rasplit.1, for processing and
outputing data. rabins specific options are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B secs <br>
Holding time in seconds before closing a bin and outputing
its contents.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M splitmode <br>
Supported spliting modes are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">time &lt;n[smhdwMy]&gt; <br>
bin records into time slots of n size. This is used for time
series analytics, especially graphing. Records, by default
are split, so that their timestamps do not <br>
span the time range specified. Metrics are uniformly
distributed among the resulting records.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">count &lt;n[kmb]&gt; <br>
bin records into chunks based on the number of records. This
is used for archive management and parallel processing
analytics, to limit the size of data processing <br>
to fixed numbers of records.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">size &lt;n[kmb]&gt; <br>
bin records into chunks based on the number of total bytes.
This is used for archive management and parallel processing
analytics, to limit the size of data process&acirc; <br>
ing to fixed byte limitations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M modes <br>
Supported processing modes are: <br>
hard split on hard time boundaries. Each flow records start
and stop times will be the time boundary times. The default
is to use the original start and stop timestamps <br>
from the records that make up the resulting aggregation.
<br>
nomodify <br>
Do not split the record when including it into a time bin.
This allows a time bin to represent times outside of its
defintion. This option should not be used with <br>
the &rsquo;hard&rsquo; option, as you will modify metrics
and semantics. <br>
-m aggregation object <br>
Supported aggregation objects are: <br>
none use a null flow key. <br>
srcid argus source identifier. <br>
smac source mac(ether) addr. <br>
dmac destination mac(ether) addr. <br>
soui oui portion of the source mac(ether) addr. <br>

dco destination ARIN country code, if present. <br>
sas source node origin AS number, if available. <br>
das destination node origin AS number, if available. <br>
ias intermediate node origin AS number, if available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P sort field <br>
Rabins can sort its output based on a sort field
specification. Because the -m option is used for aggregation
fields, -P is used to specify the print priority order. See
<br>
rasort(1) for the list of sortable fields.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w filename <br>
Rabins supports an extended -w option that allows for output
record contents to be inserted into the output filename.
Specified using &rsquo;$&rsquo; (dollar) notation, any
printable <br>
field can be used. Care should be taken to honor any shell
escape requirements when specifying on the command line. See
ra(1) for the list of printable fields.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another extended feature, when
using time mode, rabins will process the supplied filename
using strftime(3), so that time fields can be inserted into
the resulting output <br>
filename.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INVOCATION <br>
This invocation aggregates inputfile based on 10 minute time
boundaries. Input is split to fit within a 10 minute time
boundary, and within those boundaries, argus records are
<br>
aggregated. The resulting output its streamed to a single
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rabins -r * -M time 10m -w
outputfile</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This next invocation aggregates
inputfiles based on 5 minute time boundaries, and the output
is written to 5 minute files. Input is split such that all
records conform to hard <br>
10 minute time boundaries, and within those boundaries,
argus records are aggregated, in this case, based on IP
address matrix. <br>
The resulting output its streamed to files that are named
relative to the records output content, a prefix of
/matrix/%Y/%m/%d/argus. and the suffixes %H.%M.%S.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rabins -r * -M hard time 5m -m
matrix -w &quot;/matrix/%Y/%m/%d/argus.%H.%M.%S&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This next invocation aggregates
input.stream based on matrix/24 into 10 second time
boundaries, holds the data for an additional 5 seconds after
the time boundary has passed, and <br>
then prints the complete sorted contents of each bin to
standard output. The output is printed at 10 second
intervals, and the output is the content of the previous 10
sec time <br>
bin. This example is meant to provide, every 10 seconds, the
summary of all Class C subnet activity seen. It is intended
to run indefinately printing out aggregated summary <br>
records. By modifying the aggregation model, using the
&quot;-f racluster.conf&quot; option, you can achieve a
great deal of data reduction with a lot of semantic
reporting.</p>
