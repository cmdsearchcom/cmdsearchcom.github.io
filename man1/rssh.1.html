<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
rssh - restricted secure shell allowing only scp and/or
sftp</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
rssh [ options... ] [ ... ] <br>
rssh -v</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
rssh is a restricted shell for providing limited access to a
host via ssh(1), allowing a user whose shell is configured
to rssh to use one or more of the command(s) scp(1), <br>
sftp(1) cvs(1), rdist(1), and rsync(1), and only those
commands. It is intended primarily to work with OpenSSH (see
http://www.openssh.com), but may work with other
implementa&acirc; <br>
tions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The system administrator should
install the shell on the restricted system. Then the
password file entry of any user for whom it is desireable to
provide restricted access <br>
should be edited, such that their shell is rssh. For
example:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">luser:x:666:666::/home/luser:/usr/bin/rssh</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If invoked with the -v option,
rssh will report its version, and exit. All other arguments
to rssh are those specified by the remote ssh(1) client, and
aren&rsquo;t of much concern to <br>
the average user. The arguments provided must be what a
shell on the remote end would receive in order to pass
control to scp(1), sftp(1), etc. If rssh receives arguments
which <br>
do not conform, it will emit an error message and exit. If
the program the user is trying to run is not allowed, or
contains syntax which will try to execute a shell command
<br>
(such as a command substitution), it will also emit an error
and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rssh has a configuration file,
rssh.conf(5), which allows some of the behavior of rssh to
be customized. See that man page for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SECURITY NOTES <br>
Read this section with exceptional care, or you may put your
system at risk!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using rssh With CVS <br>
If you are using rssh to allow CVS access, it should be
noted that it is not possible to prevent a user who is very
familiar with CVS from bypassing rssh and getting a shell,
<br>
unless the user does not have write access in the
repository. Obviously, the user must have write access to
the repository in order to update it, which allows them to
upload <br>
arbitrary programs into the repository. CVS provides several
mechanisms for executing such arbitrary programs... The only
reasonably safe way to use rssh with CVS is to use the <br>
chroot jail facilities to place the CVS repository within a
chroot jail. Please see below and all relevant documentation
for details of how to set up chroot jails. Note that <br>
users will still be able to get shell access within the
jail; the only protection which is provided is that they can
not escape the jail. I have been pursuaded to retain support
<br>
for CVS because this protection is better than no
protection. You have been warned. Use CVS at your own
risk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Potential root Compromise With
Old Versions <br>
Before rssh 2.3.0, if a regular user had shell access to a
machine where rssh was installed, a root compromise was
possible due to rssh_chroot_helper allowing a user to
arbitrar&acirc; <br>
ily chroot(2) to anywhere on the filesystem. It is possible
to mitigate this attack against affected versions of rssh
using strict access controls to files, by making sure that
<br>
the user can not write to any file on the same partition as
system executables, and that any partition where they can
write files does not allow execution of SUID programs. As
<br>
of rssh 2.3.0, this attack has been prevented by preventing
arbitrary chroot(), if your jail is set up securely. In
particular, make sure that regular users can not write to
<br>
directories inside the jail which contain the copied
binaries. That should be obvious, but it needs to be said.
Though it should not be strictly necessary, to further
protect <br>
your system from possible compromise, it is also advisable
to follow the section below, entitled &quot;Safeguards
Against Bypassing rssh&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Safeguards Against Bypassing
rssh <br>
rssh is designed to interact with several other programs.
Even if rssh is completely bug-free, changes in those other
programs could possibly result in methods to circumvent the
<br>
protection that rssh is intended to provide. It is important
for you, the system administrator, to stay current on the
services you make available with rssh, to be sure that <br>
these commands do not provide mechanisms to allow the user
to run arbitrary commands. Also, while the goal of every
release is to be bug free, no one is perfect... There may be
<br>
undiscovered bugs in rssh which might allow a user to
circumvent it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can protect your system from
those who would take advantage of such weaknesses. This is
not required for rssh to work properly, but it is a really
good idea. There are six <br>
basic steps:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. protect all non-administrator
accounts with rssh (i.e. no regular user should have shell
access to the server)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. place your users in a chroot
jail</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. limit the binaries which live
in the jail to the absolute minimum required</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. mount their home filesystem
with the noexec/nosuid option (i.e. use separate partitions
in the jail for user home directories and all other files,
if possible/rea&acirc; <br>
sonable)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5. create a group for rssh
users, and limit executable access to the binaries to users
in that group.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6. use standard file permissions
carefully and appropriately</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If possible, make sure that no
regular user has any kind of shell access to the system
other than through rssh. Otherwise, users with shell access
could potentially exploit <br>
undiscovered bugs in rssh_chroot_helper to gain root access
to the server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rssh gives the system
administrator the ability to place the users in a chroot
jail. See details in the man page for rssh.conf and in the
file CHROOT which is distributed with <br>
the source code. If you want to ensure users can not run
arbitrary programs, use a chroot jail, and be sure not to
put any programs other than what are absolutely necessary to
<br>
provide the service you are trying to provide. This prevents
them from running standard system commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Then, make sure the user&rsquo;s
files inside the jail are on a seperate filesystem from your
system&rsquo;s executables. If possible in your environment,
make sure you mount this filesys&acirc; <br>
tem using the noexec and nosuid options, if your operating
system provides them. This prevents the users from being
able to execute programs which they have uploaded to the
tar&acirc; <br>
get machine (e.g. using scp) which might otherwise be
executable, and prevents SUID programs from respecting the
SUID bits. Note that these options necessitate the
users&rsquo; files <br>
are on separate partitions from the binaries and libraries
that live in the jail. Therefore you will need at least 2
partitions for your jail to do this properly (one for the
<br>
system binaries in the jail, the other for the user
directories).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Additionally, create a group,
for example &quot;rsshuser&quot;, for rssh users. Put all
your users who will be restricted by rssh in that group. Set
the ownership and permissions on rssh <br>
and rssh_chroot_helper so that only those users can execute
them. The following commands should illustrate:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># groupadd rsshuser <br>
# chown root:rsshuser rssh rssh_chroot_helper <br>
# chmod 550 rssh <br>
# chmod 4550 rssh_chroot_helper</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Lastly, use standard Unix/POSIX
file permissions to ensure they can not access files they
should not be able to within the chroot jail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Command Line Parser <br>
As of rssh version 2.2.3, the program must parse out the
complete command line to avoid command line options which
cause the execution of arbitrary programs (and hence bypass
the <br>
security of rssh). In order to keep the program source code
sane, the parser is a little over-zealous about matching
command line options. In practice, this probably will not
<br>
be an issue, but in theory it is possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you run into a problem where
rssh refuses to run, claiming to be rejecting insecure
command line options which were not specified, try changing
your command line such that all <br>
short options are specified as single-letter option flags
(e.g. -e -p instead of -ep) and make sure you separate
arguments from their respective options by a space (e.g. -p
123 <br>
instead of -p123). In virtually all cases, this should solve
the problem. Admittedly, an exhaustive search was not
performed, but no problematical cases were found which were
<br>
likely to be common.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The alternative would have been
to include a complete command-line parser for rcp, rdist,
and rsync; this was way out of the scope of this project. In
practice, the existing <br>
parser should suffice. If, however, you find cases where it
does not, please post details to the rssh mailing list.
Details about how to post to the mailing list can be found
<br>
at the rssh homepage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OpenSSH Versions and Bypassing
rssh <br>
Prior to OpenSSH 3.5, sshd(8) will generally attempt to
parse files in the user&rsquo;s home directory, and may also
try to run a start-up script from the user&rsquo;s
$HOME/.ssh directory. <br>
rssh does not make use of the user&rsquo;s environment in
any way. The relevant command is executed by calling
execv(3) with the full path to the command, as specified at
compile <br>
time. It does not depend upon the user&rsquo;s PATH
variable, or on any other environment variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are, however, several
problems that can arise. This is due entirely to the way the
OpenSSH Project&rsquo;s sshd works, and is in no way the
fault of rssh. For example, one <br>
problem which might exist is that, according to the sshd(8)
man page from at least some releases of OpenSSH, the
commands listed in the $HOME/.ssh/rc file are executed with
<br>
/bin/sh instead of the user&rsquo;s defined shell. This
appears not to be the case on the systems the author had
available to test on; commands were executed using the
user&rsquo;s config&acirc; <br>
ured shell (rssh), which did not allow the execution.
However if it is true on your system, then a malicious user
may be able to circumvent rssh by uploading a file to <br>
$HOME/.ssh/rc which will be executed by /bin/sh on that
system. If any releases (of OpenSSH) are, in fact,
vulnerable to this problem, then it is very likely that they
are only <br>
old, outdated versions. So long as you are running a recent
version of OpenSSH, this should not be a problem as far as I
can tell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If your sshd is vulnerable to
this attack, there is a workaround for this problem, though
it is pretty restrictive. The user&rsquo;s home directory
absolutely must not be writable by <br>
the user. If it is, the user can use sftp to remove the
directory or rename it, and then create a new one, and fill
it up with whatever environment files they like. For
provid&acirc; <br>
ing file uploads, this means a user-writable directory must
be created for them, and they must be made aware of their
inability to write into their home directory other than in
<br>
this location.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A second problem is that after
authenticating the user, sshd also reads
$HOME/.ssh/environment to allow the user to set variables in
their environment. This allows the user to <br>
completely circumvent rssh by clever manipulation of such
environment variables as LD_LIBRARY_PATH or LD_PRELOAD to
link the rssh binary against arbitrary shared libraries. In
<br>
order to prevent this from being a problem, as of version
0.9.3, by default rssh is now compiled statically. The
restrictive work-around mentioned above will also defeat
this <br>
sort of attack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As of OpenSSH 3.5, sshd now
supports the option PermitUserEnvironment which is set to
&quot;no&quot; by default. This option allows restricted
shells like rssh to function properly with&acirc; <br>
out requiring them to be linked statically. As of rssh
version 1.0.1, the configure script should detect that
OpenSSH 3.5 is present, and disable the default of static
compila&acirc; <br>
tion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
None. =8^)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A Note About Getting Help <br>
If you are having trouble getting rssh working, or you think
you&rsquo;ve found a bug, please use the mailing list, and
do not e-mail me directly. You must sign up for the list in
<br>
order to post. Information about how to sign up is available
on the rssh homepage. If you mail me directly with
questions, I will almost certainly ignore you, or at the
very <br>
least ask you to repost your question on the mailing list.
Please also feel free to provide feedback about rssh on the
mailing list, whether positive or negative (especially <br>
negative).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Security Problems <br>
The only exception to the above is if you believe you have
found a security problem with rssh. If that is the case,
then please do contact me privately. If you are unable to
<br>
find my direct contact info, post a message on the mailing
list requesting that I contact you about a potential
security problem. Security problems should be dealt with
pri&acirc; <br>
vately, so that the threat can be properly assessed, and so
as not to needlessly endanger the installations of rssh in
production environments. I take security problems
seri&acirc; <br>
ously, and will work to resolve them as quickly as
possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">N.B.: <br>
Before you e-mail me (or the mailing list) with questions,
be sure to THOROUGHLY read all of the following files:
README, INSTALL, CHROOT, SECURITY. All of these files are
dis&acirc; <br>
tributed with the rssh source code, as well as all binary
packages of rssh. If you downloaded a binary package, these
files should be located wherever your distribution keeps
<br>
its documentation files (usually
/usr/share/doc/rssh-version/ or something similar). Also
THOROUGHLY read the man pages for rssh(1), and rssh.conf(5).
Finally, if you are still <br>
having problems, read the FAQ at
http://www.pizzashack.org/rssh/faq.shtml. If it is clear to
me that you have not read these documents, I will ignore
you. In most cases, these <br>
documents will already have everything you need to get rssh
working, and I won&rsquo;t be able to explain it any better
on a mailing list than I did in those documents...</p>
