rssh - restricted secure shell allowing only scp and/or sftp

<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>rssh -v</b>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>rssh</b> is a restricted shell for providing limited access to a host via
  <b>ssh</b>(1), allowing a user whose shell is configured to <b>rssh</b> to use
  one or more of the command(s) <b>scp</b>(1), <b>sftp</b>(1) <b>cvs</b>(1),
  <b>rdist</b>(1), and <b>rsync</b>(1), and <i>only</i> those commands. It is
  intended primarily to work with OpenSSH (see http://www.openssh.com), but may
  work with other implementations.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The system administrator should install the shell on the restricted system. Then
  the password file entry of any user for whom it is desireable to provide
  restricted access should be edited, such that their shell is <b>rssh</b>. For
  example:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">luser:x:666:666::/home/luser:/usr/bin/rssh</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If invoked with the <b>-v</b> option, <b>rssh</b> will report its version, and
  exit. All other arguments to <b>rssh</b> are those specified by the remote
  <b>ssh</b>(1) client, and aren't of much concern to the average user. The
  arguments provided must be what a shell on the remote end would receive in
  order to pass control to <b>scp</b>(1), <b>sftp</b>(1), etc. If <b>rssh</b>
  receives arguments which do not conform, it will emit an error message and
  exit. If the program the user is trying to run is not allowed, or contains
  syntax which will try to execute a shell command (such as a command
  substitution), it will also emit an error and exit.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>rssh</b> has a configuration file, <i>rssh.conf</i>(5), which allows some of
  the behavior of <b>rssh</b> to be customized. See that man page for details.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SECURITY_NOTES"><a class="selflink" href="#SECURITY_NOTES">SECURITY
  NOTES</a></h1>
<i>Read this section with exceptional care, or you may put your system at
  risk!</i>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Using_rssh_With_CVS"><a class="selflink" href="#Using_rssh_With_CVS">Using
  rssh With CVS</a></h2>
If you are using <b>rssh</b> to allow CVS access, it should be noted that it is
  not possible to prevent a user who is very familiar with CVS from bypassing
  <b>rssh</b> and getting a shell, unless the user does not have write access in
  the repository. Obviously, the user must have write access to the repository
  in order to update it, which allows them to upload arbitrary programs into the
  repository. CVS provides several mechanisms for executing such arbitrary
  programs... The only reasonably safe way to use <b>rssh</b> with CVS is to use
  the chroot jail facilities to place the CVS repository within a chroot jail.
  Please see below and all relevant documentation for details of how to set up
  chroot jails. Note that <i>users will still be able to get shell access</i>
  <i>within the jail</i>; the only protection which is provided is that they can
  not escape the jail. I have been pursuaded to retain support for CVS because
  this protection is better than no protection. <i>You have been warned. Use CVS
  at your own risk.</i>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Potential_root_Compromise_With_Old_Versions"><a class="selflink" href="#Potential_root_Compromise_With_Old_Versions">Potential
  root Compromise With Old Versions</a></h2>
Before <b>rssh 2.3.0</b>, if a regular user had shell access to a machine where
  <b>rssh</b> was installed, a root compromise was possible due to
  <b>rssh_chroot_helper</b> allowing a user to arbitrarily <b>chroot</b>(2) to
  anywhere on the filesystem. It is possible to mitigate this attack against
  affected versions of <b>rssh</b> using strict access controls to files, by
  making sure that the user can not write to any file on the same partition as
  system executables, and that any partition where they can write files does not
  allow execution of SUID programs. As of <b>rssh 2.3.0</b>, this attack has
  been prevented by preventing arbitrary chroot(), <i>if your jail is set up
  securely</i>. In particular, make sure that regular users can not write to
  directories inside the jail which contain the copied binaries. That should be
  obvious, but it needs to be said. Though it should not be strictly necessary,
  to further protect your system from possible compromise, it is also advisable
  to follow the section below, entitled &quot;Safeguards Against Bypassing
  rssh&quot;.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Safeguards_Against_Bypassing_rssh"><a class="selflink" href="#Safeguards_Against_Bypassing_rssh">Safeguards
  Against Bypassing rssh</a></h2>
<b>rssh</b> is designed to interact with several other programs. Even if rssh is
  completely bug-free, changes in those other programs could possibly result in
  methods to circumvent the protection that <b>rssh</b> is intended to provide.
  <i>It is important for you, the system administrator,</i> <i>to stay current
  on the services you make available with rssh, to be sure that</i> <i>these
  commands do not provide mechanisms to allow the user to run arbitrary</i>
  <i>commands.</i> Also, while the goal of every release is to be bug free, no
  one is perfect... There may be undiscovered bugs in <b>rssh</b> which might
  allow a user to circumvent it.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can protect your system from those who would take advantage of such
  weaknesses. This is not required for <b>rssh</b> to work properly, but it is a
  really good idea. There are six basic steps:
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">1.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">protect all non-administrator accounts with rssh (i.e. no
      regular user should have shell access to the server)</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">2.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">place your users in a chroot jail</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">3.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">limit the binaries which live in the jail to the absolute
      minimum required</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">4.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">mount their home filesystem with the noexec/nosuid option
      (i.e. use separate partitions in the jail for user home directories and
      all other files, if possible/reasonable)</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">5.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">create a group for rssh users, and limit executable access
      to the binaries to users in that group.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">6.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">use standard file permissions carefully and
    appropriately</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If possible, make sure that no regular user has any kind of shell access to the
  system other than through <b>rssh</b>. Otherwise, users with shell access
  could potentially exploit undiscovered bugs in <b>rssh_chroot_helper</b> to
  gain root access to the server.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>rssh</b> gives the system administrator the ability to place the users in a
  chroot jail. See details in the man page for <b>rssh.conf</b> and in the file
  <i>CHROOT</i> which is distributed with the source code. If you want to ensure
  users can not run arbitrary programs, use a chroot jail, and be sure not to
  put any programs other than what are absolutely necessary to provide the
  service you are trying to provide. This prevents them from running standard
  system commands.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Then, make sure the user's files inside the jail are on a seperate filesystem
  from your system's executables. If possible in your environment, make sure you
  mount this filesystem using the <i>noexec</i> and <i>nosuid</i> options, if
  your operating system provides them. This prevents the users from being able
  to execute programs which they have uploaded to the target machine (e.g. using
  scp) which might otherwise be executable, and prevents SUID programs from
  respecting the SUID bits. Note that these options necessitate the users' files
  are on separate partitions from the binaries and libraries that live in the
  jail. Therefore you will need at least 2 partitions for your jail to do this
  properly (one for the system binaries in the jail, the other for the user
  directories).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Additionally, create a group, for example &quot;rsshuser&quot;, for rssh users.
  Put all your users who will be restricted by rssh in that group. Set the
  ownership and permissions on rssh and rssh_chroot_helper so that only those
  users can execute them. The following commands should illustrate:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"><b># groupadd rsshuser</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b># chown root:rsshuser rssh rssh_chroot_helper</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b># chmod 550 rssh</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b># chmod 4550 rssh_chroot_helper</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Lastly, use standard Unix/POSIX file permissions to ensure they can not access
  files they should not be able to within the chroot jail.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Command_Line_Parser"><a class="selflink" href="#Command_Line_Parser">Command
  Line Parser</a></h2>
As of <b>rssh</b> version 2.2.3, the program must parse out the complete command
  line to avoid command line options which cause the execution of arbitrary
  programs (and hence bypass the security of <b>rssh</b>). In order to keep the
  program source code sane, the parser is a little over-zealous about matching
  command line options. In practice, this probably will not be an issue, but in
  theory it is possible.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you run into a problem where <b>rssh</b> refuses to run, claiming to be
  rejecting insecure command line options which were not specified, try changing
  your command line such that all <i>short</i> options are specified as
  single-letter option flags (e.g. -e -p instead of -ep) and make sure you
  separate arguments from their respective options by a space (e.g. -p 123
  instead of -p123). In virtually all cases, this should solve the problem.
  Admittedly, an exhaustive search was not performed, but no problematical cases
  were found which were likely to be common.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The alternative would have been to include a complete command-line parser for
  rcp, rdist, and rsync; this was way out of the scope of this project. In
  practice, the existing parser should suffice. If, however, you find cases
  where it does not, please post details to the rssh mailing list. Details about
  how to post to the mailing list can be found at the rssh homepage.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="OpenSSH_Versions_and_Bypassing_rssh"><a class="selflink" href="#OpenSSH_Versions_and_Bypassing_rssh">OpenSSH
  Versions and Bypassing rssh</a></h2>
Prior to OpenSSH 3.5, <b>sshd</b>(8) will generally attempt to parse files in
  the user's home directory, and may also try to run a start-up script from the
  user's <i>$HOME/.ssh</i> directory. <b>rssh</b> does not make use of the
  user's environment in any way. The relevant command is executed by calling
  <b>execv</b>(3) with the full path to the command, as specified at compile
  time. It does not depend upon the user's PATH variable, or on any other
  environment variable.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There are, however, several problems that can arise. This is due entirely to the
  way the OpenSSH Project's sshd works, and is in no way the fault of
  <b>rssh</b>. For example, one problem which might exist is that, according to
  the <b>sshd</b>(8) man page from at least some releases of OpenSSH, the
  commands listed in the <i>$HOME/.ssh/rc</i> file are executed with
  <i>/bin/sh</i> instead of the user's defined shell. This appears not to be the
  case on the systems the author had available to test on; commands were
  executed using the user's configured shell ( <b>rssh</b>), which did not allow
  the execution. However if it is true on your system, then a malicious user may
  be able to circumvent <b>rssh</b> by uploading a file to <i>$HOME/.ssh/rc</i>
  which will be executed by <i>/bin/sh</i> on that system. If any releases (of
  OpenSSH) are, in fact, vulnerable to this problem, then it is very likely that
  they are only old, outdated versions. So long as you are running a recent
  version of OpenSSH, this should not be a problem as far as I can tell.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If your sshd <i>is</i> vulnerable to this attack, there is a workaround for this
  problem, though it is pretty restrictive. <i>The user's home directory
  absolutely must not be writable by the user.</i> If it is, the user can use
  sftp to remove the directory or rename it, and then create a new one, and fill
  it up with whatever environment files they like. For providing file uploads,
  this means a user-writable directory must be created for them, and they must
  be made aware of their inability to write into their home directory other than
  in this location.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A second problem is that after authenticating the user, sshd also reads
  <i>$HOME/.ssh/environment</i> to allow the user to set variables in their
  environment. This allows the user to completely circumvent <b>rssh</b> by
  clever manipulation of such environment variables as <i>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</i> or
  <i>LD_PRELOAD</i> to link the rssh binary against arbitrary shared libraries.
  In order to prevent this from being a problem, as of version 0.9.3, by default
  <b>rssh</b> is now compiled statically. The restrictive work-around mentioned
  above will also defeat this sort of attack.
<div class="Pp"></div>
As of OpenSSH 3.5, <i>sshd</i> now supports the option
  <i>PermitUserEnvironment</i> which is set to &quot;no&quot; by default. This
  option allows restricted shells like <b>rssh</b> to function properly without
  requiring them to be linked statically. As of <b>rssh</b> version 1.0.1, the
  configure script should detect that OpenSSH 3.5 is present, and disable the
  default of static compilation.

If you are having trouble getting <b>rssh</b> working, or you think you've found
  a bug, please use the mailing list, and <i>do not e-mail me</i>
  <i>directly</i>. You must sign up for the list in order to post. Information
  about how to sign up is available on the rssh homepage. If you mail me
  directly with questions, I will almost certainly ignore you, or at the very
  least ask you to repost your question on the mailing list. Please also feel

The only exception to the above is if you believe you have found a security
  problem with <b>rssh</b>. If that is the case, then please <i>do</i> contact
  me privately. If you are unable to find my direct contact info, post a message
  on the mailing list requesting that I contact you about a potential security
  problem. Security problems should be dealt with privately, so that the threat
  can be properly assessed, and so as not to needlessly endanger the

Before you e-mail me (or the mailing list) with questions, be sure to
  <i>THOROUGHLY</i> read all of the following files: README, INSTALL, CHROOT,
  SECURITY. All of these files are distributed with the rssh source code, as
  well as all binary packages of <b>rssh</b>. If you downloaded a binary
  package, these files should be located wherever your distribution keeps its
  documentation files (usually /usr/share/doc/rssh-version/ or something
  similar). Also <i>THOROUGHLY</i> read the man pages for <b>rssh</b>(1), and
  <b>rssh.conf</b>(5). Finally, if you are still having problems, read the FAQ
  at http://www.pizzashack.org/rssh/faq.shtml. If it is clear to me that you
  have not read these documents, I will ignore you. In most cases, these
  documents will already have everything you need to get rssh working, and I
  won't be able to explain it any better on a mailing list than I did in those
