include_server.py - conservative approximation of include dependencies for C/C++
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<b>include_server</b> --port <i>INCLUDE_SERVER_PORT [OPTIONS]</i>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
include_server.py starts an include server process. This process answers queries
  from <b>distcc</b>(1) clients about what files to include in C/C++
  compilations. The include_server.py command itself terminates as soon as the
  include server has been spawned.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The INCLUDE_SERVER_PORT argument is the name of a socket used for all
  communication between distcc clients and the include server. The
  <b>distcc-pump</b>(1) command is responsible for creating the socket location,
  for passing it to this script, and for passing it to all distcc clients via
  the environment variable named INCLUDE_SERVER_PORT.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The protocol used by the include server uses distcc's RPC implementation. Each
  distcc request consists of (1) the current directory and (2) the list of
  arguments of the compilation command.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the include server is able to process the request, then it answers the distcc
  client by sending a list of filepaths. The filepaths are those of the
  compressed source and header files found to be necessary for compilation
  through include analysis. The list also comprises symbolic links and even
  dummy files needed for the compilation server to construct an accurate replica
  of the parts of the filesystem needed for compilation. In this way, a needed
  header file like /path/foo.h is compressed, renamed, and stored in a temporary
  location, such as /dev/shm/tmpiAvfGv.include_server-9368-1/path/foo.h.lzo. The
  distcc client will pass these files on to a compilation server, where they
  will be uncompressed and mounted temporarily.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the include server is not able to process the request, then it returns the
  empty list to the distcc client.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There are two kinds of failures that relate to the include server. The include
  server may fail to compute the includes or fail in other ways, see section
  <b>INCLUDE SERVER SYMPTOMS</b>. Also, the compilation on the remove server may
  fail due to inadequacy of the calculated include closure, but then succeed
  when locally retried, see section <b>DISTCC DISCREPANCY SYMPTOMS</b>.

  <dd class="It-tag">Do preprocessing on the compilation server even if includes
      of absolute filepaths are encountered. Normally the include-server will
      fall back on local preprocessing if it detects any absolute includes.
      Thus, this flag is useful for preventing such fallbacks when the absolute
      includes are a false alarm, either because the absolute include is
      discarded during preprocessing or because the absolutely included file
      exists on the compilation servers.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    More precisely, with --unsafe_absolute_includes absolute includes are
      ignored for the purposes of gathering the include closure. Using this
      option may lead to incorrect results because (1) the header may actually
      be included on the compilation server and it may not be the same as on the
      client, (2) the include directives of the header are not further analyzed.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The option is useful for compiling code that has such hardcoded absolute
      locations of header files inside conditional directives (e.g.
      &quot;#ifdef&quot;) that render the includes irrelevant. More precisely,
      these includes must be eliminated during preprocessing for the actual
      configuration. Then the question of existence of the header file is moot
      and the remote compilation is sound. This is often the case if such
      includes are meant for unusual configurations different from the actual
      configuration.</dd>

      include closure. The distcc client cannot use pump-mode.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    To overcome this problem in a not always reliable way, set the environment

      invalid. This message can usually be ignored; it does signify a somewhat

  DISCREPANCY SYMPTOMS</a></h1>
The interactions between the build system, distcc, and the include server is
  somewhat complex. When a distcc commands receives a failing compilation from
  the remote server it retries the compilation locally. This section discusses
  the causes of discrepancies between remote and local compilation. These are
  flagged by the demotion message:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>__________Warning: ... pump-mode compilation(s) failed on server,</b> <b>but
  succeeded locally.</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>__________Distcc-pump was demoted to plain mode.</b> <b>See the Distcc
  Discrepancy Symptoms section in the include_server(1) man</b> <b>page.</b>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The distcc-pump script issues this message at the end of the build. This means
  that for at least one distcc invocation a local compilation succeeded after
  the remote compilation failed. Each distcc invocation for which such a
  discrepancy occurred in turn also issues a message such as:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>Warning: remote compilation of '...' failed,</b> <b>retried locally and got a
  different result.</b>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The demotion makes subsequent distcc invocations use plain distcc mode. Thus
  preprocessing will take place on the local machine for the remainder of the
  build. This technique prevents very slow builds where all compilations end up
  on the local machine after failing remotely.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Of course, if the local compilations fails after the remote failures, then the
  distcc invocation exits with the non-zero status of the local compilation. The
  error messages printed are also those of the local compilation.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The fallback behavior for distcc-pump mode to local compilation can be disabled
  by setting the environment variable DISTCC_FALLBACK to 1, which makes the
  distcc command fail as soon as the remote compilation has failed. This setting
  is very useful for debugging why the remote compilation went wrong, because
  now the output from the server will be printed.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Next we discuss the possible causes of discrepancies.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>The user changed a source or header file during the
    build.</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This yields inconsistent results of course.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
  </dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>A source or header file changed during the
    build.</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The build system rewrites a file. For Linux kernel 2.6,
      this happens for 'include/linux/compile.h' and
      'include/asm/asm-offsets.h'. This condition is fixed by letting the
      include server know that it must reset its caches when a stat of any of
      the files changes. Practically, this is done by gathering the files in a
      colon-separated list and then setting the INCLUDE_SERVER_ARGS command as
      in:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <br/>
    
      include_server_args=&quot;--stat_reset_triggers=include/linux/compile.h:include/asm/asm-offsets.h&quot;
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
  </dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>A header file is potentially included, but does not
    exist, and is then later included.</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This occurs when some header foo.h includes another header file trick.h, but
      the trick.h file has not yet been generated and the inclusion is actually
      ignored because of preprocessing directives. The include server will probe
      for the existence of trick.h, because it overapproximates all possible
      ways directives actually evaluate. The file trick.h is determined not to
      exist. If it is later generated, and then really included, then the
      include server will falsely believe that the file still does not exist.
      The solution to this problem is to make the build system generate trick.h
      before the first time any header file is included that makes a syntactic
      reference to trick.h
