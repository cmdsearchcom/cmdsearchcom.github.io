<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
include_server.py - conservative approximation of include
dependencies for C/C++</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
include_server --port INCLUDE_SERVER_PORT [OPTIONS]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
include_server.py starts an include server process. This
process answers queries from distcc(1) clients about what
files to include in C/C++ compilations. The
include_server.py <br>
command itself terminates as soon as the include server has
been spawned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The INCLUDE_SERVER_PORT argument
is the name of a socket used for all communication between
distcc clients and the include server. The distcc-pump(1)
command is responsible for <br>
creating the socket location, for passing it to this script,
and for passing it to all distcc clients via the environment
variable named INCLUDE_SERVER_PORT.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The protocol used by the include
server uses distcc&rsquo;s RPC implementation. Each distcc
request consists of (1) the current directory and (2) the
list of arguments of the compila&acirc; <br>
tion command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the include server is able to
process the request, then it answers the distcc client by
sending a list of filepaths. The filepaths are those of the
compressed source and <br>
header files found to be necessary for compilation through
include analysis. The list also comprises symbolic links and
even dummy files needed for the compilation server to <br>
construct an accurate replica of the parts of the filesystem
needed for compilation. In this way, a needed header file
like /path/foo.h is compressed, renamed, and stored in a
<br>
temporary location, such as
/dev/shm/tmpiAvfGv.include_server-9368-1/path/foo.h.lzo. The
distcc client will pass these files on to a compilation
server, where they will be <br>
uncompressed and mounted temporarily.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the include server is not
able to process the request, then it returns the empty list
to the distcc client.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are two kinds of failures
that relate to the include server. The include server may
fail to compute the includes or fail in other ways, see
section INCLUDE SERVER SYMPTOMS. <br>
Also, the compilation on the remove server may fail due to
inadequacy of the calculated include closure, but then
succeed when locally retried, see section DISTCC DISCREPANCY
<br>
SYMPTOMS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTION SUMMARY <br>
The following options are understood by
include_server.py.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dPAT, --debug_pattern=PAT <br>
Bit vector for turning on warnings and debugging <br>
1 = warnings <br>
2 = trace some functions <br>
other powers of two: see include_server/basics.py.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e, --email <br>
Send email to &rsquo;distcc-pump-errors&rsquo; or if
defined, the value of enviroment variable
DISTCC_EMAILLOG_WHOM_TO_BLAME, when include server gets in
trouble. The default is to <br>
not send email.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--email_bound NUMBER <br>
Maximal number of emails to send (in addition to a final
email). Default: 3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-email <br>
Do not send email. This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--path_observation_re=RE <br>
Issue warning message whenever a filename is resolved to a
realpath that is matched by RE, which is a regular
expression in Python syntax. This is useful for finding out
<br>
where files included actually come from. Use RE=&quot;&quot;
to find them all. Note: warnings must be enabled with at
least -d1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--pid_file FILEPATH <br>
The pid of the include server is written to file FILEPATH.
This allows a script such a distcc-pump to tear down the
include server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --statistics <br>
Print information to stdout about include analysis.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--stat_reset_triggers=LIST <br>
Flush stat caches when the timestamp of any filepath in LIST
changes or the filepath comes in or out of existence. LIST
is a colon separated string of filepaths, possibly <br>
containing simple globs (as allowed by Python&rsquo;s glob
module). Print a warning whenever such a change happens (if
warnings are enabled). This option allows limited
excep&acirc; <br>
tions to distcc-pump&rsquo;s normal assumption that source
files are not modified during the build.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t, --time <br>
Print elapsed, user, and system time to stderr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--unsafe_absolute_includes <br>
Do preprocessing on the compilation server even if includes
of absolute filepaths are encountered. Normally the
include-server will fall back on local preprocessing if it
<br>
detects any absolute includes. Thus, this flag is useful for
preventing such fallbacks when the absolute includes are a
false alarm, either because the absolute include <br>
is discarded during preprocessing or because the absolutely
included file exists on the compilation servers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">More precisely, with
--unsafe_absolute_includes absolute includes are ignored for
the purposes of gathering the include closure. Using this
option may lead to incorrect <br>
results because (1) the header may actually be included on
the compilation server and it may not be the same as on the
client, (2) the include directives of the header are <br>
not further analyzed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The option is useful for
compiling code that has such hardcoded absolute locations of
header files inside conditional directives (e.g.
&quot;#ifdef&quot;) that render the includes <br>
irrelevant. More precisely, these includes must be
eliminated during preprocessing for the actual
configuration. Then the question of existence of the header
file is moot <br>
and the remote compilation is sound. This is often the case
if such includes are meant for unusual configurations
different from the actual configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verify <br>
Verify that files in CPP closure are contained in closure
calculated by include processor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w, --write_include_closure <br>
Write a .d_approx file which lists all the included files
calculated by the include server; with -x, additionally
write the included files as calculated by CPP to a <br>
.d_exact file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x, --exact_analysis <br>
Use CPP instead, do not omit system headers files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INCLUDE SERVER SYMPTOMS AND
ISSUES <br>
The most likely messages and warnings to come from the
include processor are listed below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Preprocessing locally. Include
server not covering: Couldn&rsquo;t determine default system
include directories <br>
To determine the default system header directories, the
include server runs the compiler once for each language
needed during its session. This message indicates that the
<br>
compiler specified to distcc is not present on the
client.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Preprocessing locally. Include
server not covering: Bailing out because include server
spent more than ...s user time handling request <br>
In uncommon situations, the include server fails to analyze
very complicated macro expressions. The distcc client will
use plain distcc mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning: Filepath must be
relative but isn&rsquo;t <br>
The include server does not accept absolute filepaths, such
as /usr/include/stdio.h, in include directives, because
there is no guarantee that this header on the compila&acirc;
<br>
tion server machine will be the same as that on the client.
The include server gives up analyzing the include closure.
The distcc client cannot use pump-mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To overcome this problem in a
not always reliable way, set the environment variable
INCLUDE_SERVER_ARGS=&rsquo;--unsafe_absolute_includes&rsquo;
when invoking the distcc-pump script <br>
to pass the --unsafe_absolute_includes option to the include
server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning: Absolute filepath ...
was IGNORED <br>
The --unsafe_absolute_includes is in use. This situation
happens under the same circumstances as when &quot;Filepath
must be relative but isn&rsquo;t&quot; is issued, but in
this case <br>
the include will provide an answer to the distcc client.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning: Path
&rsquo;/PATH/FILE&rsquo; changed/came into existence/no
longer exists <br>
These warnings are issued when using stat reset triggers.
Because /PATH/FILE changed, the include server clears its
caches; the new version of the file (or the lack of <br>
it) renders the include analysis invalid. This message can
usually be ignored; it does signify a somewhat precarious
use of files by the build system. It is recommended <br>
to fix the build system so that files are not rewritten.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning: For translation unit
..., lookup of file ... resolved to ... whose realpath is
... <br>
This warning occurs with --path_observation_re when a new
realpath matching a source or header file is observed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DISTCC DISCREPANCY SYMPTOMS <br>
The interactions between the build system, distcc, and the
include server is somewhat complex. When a distcc commands
receives a failing compilation from the remote server it
<br>
retries the compilation locally. This section discusses the
causes of discrepancies between remote and local
compilation. These are flagged by the demotion message:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">__________Warning: ... pump-mode
compilation(s) failed on server, but succeeded locally. <br>
__________Distcc-pump was demoted to plain mode. See the
Distcc Discrepancy Symptoms section in the include_server(1)
man page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The distcc-pump script issues
this message at the end of the build. This means that for at
least one distcc invocation a local compilation succeeded
after the remote compilation <br>
failed. Each distcc invocation for which such a discrepancy
occurred in turn also issues a message such as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning: remote compilation of
&rsquo;...&rsquo; failed, retried locally and got a
different result.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The demotion makes subsequent
distcc invocations use plain distcc mode. Thus preprocessing
will take place on the local machine for the remainder of
the build. This technique <br>
prevents very slow builds where all compilations end up on
the local machine after failing remotely.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Of course, if the local
compilations fails after the remote failures, then the
distcc invocation exits with the non-zero status of the
local compilation. The error messages <br>
printed are also those of the local compilation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The fallback behavior for
distcc-pump mode to local compilation can be disabled by
setting the environment variable DISTCC_FALLBACK to 1, which
makes the distcc command fail as <br>
soon as the remote compilation has failed. This setting is
very useful for debugging why the remote compilation went
wrong, because now the output from the server will be <br>
printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Next we discuss the possible
causes of discrepancies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The user changed a source or
header file during the build. <br>
This yields inconsistent results of course.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A source or header file changed
during the build. <br>
The build system rewrites a file. For Linux kernel 2.6, this
happens for &rsquo;include/linux/compile.h&rsquo; and
&rsquo;include/asm/asm-offsets.h&rsquo;. This condition is
fixed by letting the <br>
include server know that it must reset its caches when a
stat of any of the files changes. Practically, this is done
by gathering the files in a colon-separated list and <br>
then setting the INCLUDE_SERVER_ARGS command as in:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">include_server_args=&quot;--stat_reset_triggers=include/linux/compile.h:include/asm/asm-offsets.h&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A header file is potentially
included, but does not exist, and is then later
included.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This occurs when some header
foo.h includes another header file trick.h, but the trick.h
file has not yet been generated and the inclusion is
actually ignored because of <br>
preprocessing directives. The include server will probe for
the existence of trick.h, because it overapproximates all
possible ways directives actually evaluate. The file <br>
trick.h is determined not to exist. If it is later
generated, and then really included, then the include server
will falsely believe that the file still does not exist.
<br>
The solution to this problem is to make the build system
generate trick.h before the first time any header file is
included that makes a syntactic reference to trick.h</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The include server was started
with --unsafe_absolute_includes. <br>
This is a problem if there are header files locally that do
not exist remotely and that are actually used. Such includes
are often protected by conditional directives <br>
that evaluate so that are actually used on only specific and
often uncommon platforms. If you are not compiling for such
a platform, then it may be correct to use <br>
--unsafe_absolute_include.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The include server has
calculated the wrong includes. <br>
We do not know of such a situation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT CODES <br>
The exit code of include_server.py is usually 0. That the
include server has been started properly is communicated
through the existence of the pid_file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
DISTCC_EMAILLOG_WHOM_TO_BLAME The email address to use for
include server automated emails. The default is
&rsquo;distcc-pump-errors&rsquo; (which is an email address
that probably will not <br>
exist in your domain).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Additionally, the invocation of
the compiler may use additional environment variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
If you think you have found a distcc bug, please see the
file reporting-bugs.txt in the documentation directory for
information on how to report it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In distcc-pump mode, the include
server is unable to handle certain very complicated computed
includes as found in parts of the Boost library. The include
server will time out <br>
and distcc will revert to plain mode.</p>
