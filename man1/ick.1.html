<p>ICK(1) General Commands Manual ICK(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ick - INTERCAL compiler</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ick [options] file...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ick -e [options] intercal-file
[non-intercal-file...] [library...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This manual page documents briefly the ick command. This
manual page was originally written for the Debian GNU/Linux
distribution (but may be used by others), because the
origi&acirc; <br>
nal program did not have a manual page, and was then added
back to the main distribution. Fuller documentation is
available via the command info ick (for the ick command
itself; <br>
even fuller documentation is available via info C-INTERCAL
(which contains the documentation for both the compiler and
the INTERCAL language)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ick takes INTERCAL programs and
generates code from them (by running gcc).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the base in which a
program is written is deduced from its extension; INTERCAL
programs in base 2 must have the extension .i, INTERCAL
programs in bases from 3 to 7 <br>
must have an extension from .3i to .7i respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">No options take arguments;
multiple options can be given separately or combined in the
usual way (even -e). The order in which options is given is
irrelevant unless they con&acirc; <br>
flict, in which case the options that are given last on the
command line take precedence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-c Compile INTERCAL to C, but don&rsquo;t compile the
resulting C.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Print yacc debugging
information (implies -c).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Requires strict INTERCAL-72
compliance (rejecting COME FROM, the extensions for bases
other than two, and other features not found in
INTERCAL-72).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b Disables the INTERCAL-72
random-bug feature.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O Attempt to optimize
expressions in the generated code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C Clockface output (using IIII
rather than IV in Roman numerals).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Optimize control flow in
generated code (prevents -yp).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F Optimize everything in
generated code for speed, regardless of how slow the
compiler becomes or how large the object file becomes.
Implies -fO, prevents -cdeghpyH.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Print optimizer debugging
information (implies -cO).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H Print verbose optimizer
debugging information (implies -cO).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-hH Print optimizer debugging
information in a different form (implies -cO).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w Enable the +printflow option
in output programs even if they are not multithreaded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-y Run the yuk debugger on the
code (prevents -fme).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p Run the yuk profiler on the
code (prevents -fme).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m Allow multithreading and
backtracking (prevents -ype, implies -w).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e Link one INTERCAL file to
non-INTERCAL files or to expansion libraries. Doing this
changes the syntax of the command line; the first file given
must be the INTERCAL <br>
source file, then this can be followed by any number of
files in other languages to link via the external calls
system (currently only C and maybe Befunge-98 programs are
<br>
allowed), and then any number of expansion libraries. The
non-INTERCAL files will be processed to link them to the
INTERCAL files, and then compiled with gcc and linked to
<br>
the main INTERCAL program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E Do not link any system
libraries, even if the code suggests that one or more is
needed (prevents -P).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a Allow the use of the CREATE
statement (prevents -P).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Allow anything on the left of
an assignment, and turn off the protection that constants
otherwise have against being assigned to (prevents
-fFOP).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P Compile PIC-INTERCAL rather
than INTERCAL (prevents -amFvxeE, implies -cfO).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o Output to stdout rather than
.c (implies -c).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X Interpret ambiguous syntax
such as ? and @ with Princeton meanings (as used by
CLC-INTERCAL), rather than with the default Atari
meanings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x Use CLC-INTERCAL rules for
text I/O and for abstaining from a GIVE UP by label
(prevents -P).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u Print a message whenever the
compiler tries to open a file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U Dump core on E778 as well as
printing an error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Y Display the command lines for
programs invoked by ick.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g Leave the generated C in
place, and make the output executable debuggable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l Attempt to report likely bugs
and nonportabilities (implies -O).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
The newsgroup alt.lang.intercal is where INTERCAL compilers
are announced, and INTERCAL itself is discussed; the website
http://catb.org/~esr/intercal is where the most recent <br>
versions of C-INTERCAL are currently hosted.</p>
