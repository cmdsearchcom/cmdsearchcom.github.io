<p>POSTFIX-LOGWATCH(1) General Commands Manual
POSTFIX-LOGWATCH(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
postfix-logwatch - A Postfix log parser and analysis
utility</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
postfix-logwatch [options] [logfile ...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The postfix-logwatch(1) utility is a Postfix MTA log parser
that produces summaries, details, and statistics regarding
the operation of Postfix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This utility can be used as a
standalone program, or as a Logwatch filter module to
produce Postfix summary and detailed reports from within
Logwatch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Postfix-logwatch is able to
produce a wide range of reports with data grouped and sorted
as much as possible to reduce noise and highlight patterns.
Brief summary reports pro&acirc; <br>
vide a quick overview of general Postfix operations and
message delivery, calling out warnings that may require
attention. Detailed reports provide easy to scan,
hierarchically- <br>
arranged and organized information, with as much or little
detail as desired.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Postfix-logwatch outputs two
principal sections: a Summary section and a Detailed
section. For readability and quick scanning, all event or
hit counts appear in the left column, <br>
followed by brief description of the event type, and finally
additional statistics or count representations may appear in
the rightmost column.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following segment from a
sample Summary report illustrates:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">****** Summary
********************************************</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">81 *Warning: Connection rate
limit reached (anvil) <br>
146 Warned</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">68.310M Bytes accepted
71,628,177 <br>
97.645M Bytes delivered 102,388,245 <br>
========
================================================</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3464 Accepted 41.44% <br>
4895 Rejected 58.56% <br>
-------- ------------------------------------------------
<br>
8359 Total 100.00% <br>
========
================================================</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The report warns that
anvil&rsquo;s connection rate was hit 81 times, a Postfix
access check WARN action was logged 146 times, and a total
of 68.310 megabytes (71,628,177 bytes) were <br>
accepted into the Postfix system, delivering 97.645
megabytes of data (due to multiple recipients). The Accepted
and Rejected lines show that Postfix accepted 3464 (41.44%
of <br>
the total messages) and rejected 4895 (the remaining 58.56%)
of the 8359 total messages (temporary rejects show up
elsewhere).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are dozens of sub-sections
available in the Detailed report, each of whose output can
be controlled in various ways. Each sub-section attempts to
group and present the <br>
most meaningful data at superior levels, while pushing less
useful or noisy data towards inferior levels. The goal is to
provide as much benefit as possible from smart grouping <br>
of data, to allow faster report scanning, pattern
identification, and problem solving. Data is always sorted
in descending order by count, and then numerically by IP
address or <br>
alphabetically as appropriate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following MX errors segment
from a sample Detailed report illustrates the basic
hierarchical level structure of postfix-logwatch:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">****** Detailed
*******************************************</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">261 MX errors
-------------------------------------- <br>
261 Unable to look up MX host <br>
222 Host not found <br>
73 foolishspammer.local <br>
60 completely.bogus.domain.example <br>
11 friend.example.com <br>
39 No address associated with hostname <br>
23 dummymx.sample.net <br>
16 pushn.spam.sample.com</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The postfix-logwatch utility
reads from STDIN or from the named Postfix logfile. Multiple
logfile arguments may be specified, each processed in order.
The user running postfix- <br>
logwatch must have read permission on each named log
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options <br>
The options listed below affect the operation of
postfix-logwatch. Options specified later on the command
line override earlier ones. Any option may be abbreviated to
an unam&acirc; <br>
biguous length.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f config_file <br>
--config_file config_file <br>
Use an alternate configuration file config_file instead of
the default. This option may be used more than once.
Multiple configuration files will be processed in the <br>
order presented on the command line. See CONFIGURATION FILE
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--debug keywords <br>
Output debug information during the operation of
postfix-logwatch. The parameter keywords is one or more
comma or space separated keywords. To obtain the list of
valid <br>
keywords, use --debug xxx where xxx is any invalid
keyword.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--[no]delays <br>
Enables (disables) output of the message delays percentiles
report. The delays percentiles report shows percentiles for
each of the 4 delivery latency times reported by <br>
Postfix (available in version 2.3 and later) in the form
delays=a/b/c/d, where a is the amount of time before the
active queue (includes time for previous delivery <br>
attempts and time in the deferred queue), b is the amount of
time in the active queue up to delivery agent handoff, c is
the amount of time spent making connections <br>
(including DNS, HELO and TLS) and d is the amount of time
spent delivering the message. The total delay shown comes
from the delay= field in a message delivery log line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: This report may consume a
large amount of memory; if you have no use for it, disable
the delays report.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--delays_percentiles p1 [p2 ...]
<br>
Specifies the percentiles to be used in the message delays
percentiles report. The percentiles p1, p2, ... range from 0
to 100, inclusively. The order of the list is not <br>
sorted - the report will output the percentiles columns in
the order you specify.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--detail level <br>
Sets the maximum detail level for postfix-logwatch to level.
This option is global, overriding any other output limiters
described below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The postfix-logwatch utility
produces a Summary section, a Detailed section, and
additional report sections. With level less than 5,
postfix-logwatch will produce only <br>
the Summary section. At level 5 and above, the Detailed
section, and any additional report sections are candidates
for output. Each incremental increase in level gener&acirc;
<br>
ates one additional hierarchical sub-level of output in the
Detailed section of the report. At level 10, all levels are
output. Lines that exceed the maximum report <br>
width (specified with max_report_width) will be cut. Setting
level to 11 will prevent lines in the report from being cut
(see also --line_style).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help Print usage information
and a brief description about command line options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ignore_service pattern <br>
Ignore log lines that contain the postfix service name
postfix/service. The parameter service is a regular
expression.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: if you use parenthesis in
your regular expression, be sure they are cloistering and
not capturing: use (?:pattern) instead of (pattern).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ipaddr_width width <br>
Specifies that IP addresses in address/hostname pairs should
be printed with a field width of width characters.
Increasing the default may be useful for systems using <br>
long IPv6 addresses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l limiter=levelspec <br>
--limit limiter=levelspec <br>
Sets the level limiter limiter with the specification
levelspec.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--line_style style <br>
Specifies how to handle long report lines. Three styles are
available: full, truncate, and wrap. Setting style to full
will prevent cutting lines to max_report_width; <br>
this is what occurs when detail is 11 or higher. When style
is truncate (the default), long lines will be truncated
according to max_report_width. Setting style to wrap <br>
will wrap lines longer than max_report_width such that left
column hit counts are not obscured. This option takes
precedence over the line style implied by the detail <br>
level. The options --full, --truncate, and --wrap are
synonyms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--[no]long_queue_ids <br>
Enables (disables) interpretation of long queue IDs in
Postfix (&gt;= 2.9) logs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--nodetail <br>
Disables the Detailed section of the report, and all
supplemental reports. This option provides a convenient
mechanism to quickly disable all sections under the Detailed
<br>
report, where subsequent command line options may re-enable
one or more sections to create specific reports.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--[no]summary</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--show_summary <br>
Enables (disables) displaying of the the Summary section of
the report. The variable Posfix_Show_Summary in used in a
configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--recipient_delimiter delimiter
<br>
Split email delivery addresses using the recipient delimiter
character delimiter. This should generally match the
recipient_delimiter specified in the Postfix parameter <br>
file main.cf, or the default value indicated in postconf -d
recipient_delimiter. This is very useful for obtaining
per-alias statistics when a recipient delimeter is used <br>
for mail delivery.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--reject_reply_patterns r1 [r2
...] <br>
Specifies the list of reject reply patterns used to create
reject groups. Each entry in the list r1 [r2 ...] must be
either a three character regular expression reply <br>
code of the form [45][0-9.][0-9.], or the word
&quot;Warn&quot;. The &quot;.&quot; in the regular
expression is a literal dot which matches any reject reply
subcode; this wildcarding allows <br>
creation of broad rejects groups. List order is preserved,
in that reject reports will be output in the same order as
the entries in the list. Specific reject reply <br>
codes will take priority over wildcard patterns, regardless
of the list order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default list is &quot;5..
4.. Warn&quot;, which creates three groups of rejects:
permanent rejects, temporary reject failures, and reject
warnings (as in warn_if_reject).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This feature allows, for
example, distinguishing 421 transmission channel closures
from 45x errors (eg. 450 mailbox unavailable, 451 local
processing errors, 452 insuffi&acirc; <br>
cient storage). Such a grouping would be configured with the
list: &quot;421 4.. 5.. Warn&quot;. See RFC 2821 for more
information about reply codes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See also CONFIGURATION FILE
regarding using reject_reply_patterns within a configuration
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--[no]sect_vars <br>
--show_sect_vars boolean <br>
Enables (disables) supplementing each Detailed section title
with the name of that section&rsquo;s level limiter. The
name displayed is the command line option (or
configura&acirc; <br>
tion file variable) used to limit that section&rsquo;s
output. With the large number of level limiters available in
postfix-logwatch, this a convenient mechanism for
determin&acirc; <br>
ing exactly which level limiter affects a section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--syslog_name namepat <br>
Specifies the syslog service name that postfix-logwatch uses
to match syslog lines. Only log lines whose service name
matches the perl regular expression namepat will be <br>
used by postfix-logwatch; all non-matching lines are
silently ignored. This is useful when a pre-installed
Postfix package uses a name other than the default
(postfix), <br>
or when multiple Postfix instances are in use and
per-instance reporting is desired.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The pattern namepat should match
the syslog_name configuration parameter specified in the
Postfix parameter file main.cf, the master control file
master.cf, or the default <br>
value as indicated by the output of postconf -d
syslog_name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: if you use parenthesis in
your regular expression, be sure they are cloistering and
not capturing: use (?:pattern) instead of (pattern).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--[no]unknown <br>
--show_unknown boolean <br>
Enables (disables) display of the postfix-generated name of
&rsquo;unknown&rsquo; in formated IP/hostname pairs in
Detailed reports. Default: enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Print postfix-logwatch version information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Level Limiters <br>
The output of every section in the Detailed report is
controlled by a level limiter. The name of the level limiter
variable will be output when the sect_vars option is set.
<br>
Level limiters are set either via command line in standalone
mode with --limit limiter=levelspec option, or via
configuration file variable $postfix_limiter=levelspec. Each
lim&acirc; <br>
iter requires a levelspec argument, which is described below
in LEVEL CONTROL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The list of level limiters is
shown below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are several level limiters
that control reject sub-sections (eg. rejectbody,
rejectsender, etc.). Because the list of reject variants is
not known until runtime after <br>
reject_reply_patterns is seen, these reject limiters are
shown below generically, with the prefix ###. To use one of
these reject limiters, substitute ### with one of the reject
<br>
reply codes in effect, replacing each dot with an x
character. For example, using the default
reject_reply_patterns list of &quot;5.. 4.. Warn&quot;,
three rejectbody variants are valid: <br>
--limit 5xxrejectbody, --limit 4xxrejectbody and --limit
warnrejectbody. As a convenience, you may entirely eliminate
the ### prefix, and instead use the bare rejectXXX option,
<br>
and all reject level limiter variations will be
auto-generated based on the reject_reply_patterns list. For
example, the command line segment:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">... --reject_reply_patterns
&quot;421 5..&quot; --limit rejectrbl=&quot;1:10:&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">would automatically become:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">... --reject_reply_patterns
&quot;421 5..&quot; --limit 421rejectrbl=&quot;1:10:&quot;
--limit 5xxrejectrbl=&quot;1:10:&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See reject_reply_patterns above,
and comments in the configuration file
postfix-logwatch.conf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LEVEL CONTROL <br>
The Detailed section of the report consists of a number of
sub-sections, each of which is controlled both globally and
independently. Two settings influence the output provided
<br>
in the Detailed report: a global detail level (specified
with --detail) which has final (big hammer) output-limiting
control over the Detailed section, and sub-section specific
<br>
detail settings (small hammer), which allow further limiting
of the output for a sub-section. Each sub-section may be
limited to a specific depth level, and each sub-level may
<br>
be limited with top N or threshold limits. The levelspec
argument to each of the level limiters listed above is used
to accomplish this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is probably best to continue
explanation of sub-level limiting with the following
well-known outline-style hierarchy, and some basic
examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">level 0 <br>
level 1 <br>
level 2 <br>
level 3 <br>
level 4 <br>
level 4 <br>
level 2 <br>
level 3 <br>
level 4 <br>
level 4 <br>
level 4 <br>
level 3 <br>
level 4 <br>
level 3 <br>
level 1 <br>
level 2 <br>
level 3 <br>
level 4</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The simplest form of output
limiting suppresses all output below a specified level. For
example, a levelspec set to &quot;2&quot; shows only data in
levels 0 through 2. Think of this as <br>
collapsing each sub-level 2 item, thus hiding all inferior
levels (3, 4, ...), to yield:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">level 0 <br>
level 1 <br>
level 2 <br>
level 2 <br>
level 1 <br>
level 2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sometimes the volume of output
in a section is too great, and it is useful to suppress any
data that does not exceed a certain threshold value.
Consider a dictionary spam <br>
attack, which produces very lengthy lists of hit-once
recipient email or IP addresses. Each sub-level in the
hierarchy can be threshold-limited by setting the levelspec
appro&acirc; <br>
priately. Setting levelspec to the value &quot;2::5&quot;
will suppress any data at level 2 that does not exceed a hit
count of 5.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perhaps producing a top N list,
such as top 10 senders, is desired. A levelspec of
&quot;3:10:&quot; limits level 3 data to only the top 10
hits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With those simple examples out
of the way, a levelspec is defined as a whitespace- or
comma-separated list of one or more of the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">l Specifies the maximum level to
be output for this sub-section, with a range from 0 to 10.
if l is 0, no levels will be output, effectively disabling
the sub-section <br>
(level 0 data is already provided in the Summary report, so
level 1 is considered the first useful level in the Detailed
report). Higher values will produce output up to <br>
and including the specified level.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">l.n Same as above, with the
addition that n limits this section&rsquo;s level 1 output
to the top n items. The value for n can be any integer
greater than 1. (This form of limit&acirc; <br>
ing has less utility than the syntax shown below. It is
provided for backwards compatibility; users are encouraged
to use the syntax below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">l:n:t This triplet specifies
level l, top n, and minimum threshold t. Each of the values
are integers, with l being the level limiter as described
above, n being a top n lim&acirc; <br>
iter for the level l, and t being the threshold limiter for
level l. When both n and t are specified, n has priority,
allowing top n lists (regardless of threshold <br>
value). If the value of l is omitted, the specified values
for n and/or t are used for all levels available in the
sub-section. This permits a simple form of wildcarding <br>
(eg. place minimum threshold limits on all levels). However,
specific limiters always override wildcard limiters. The
first form of level limiter may be included in lev&acirc;
<br>
elspec to restrict output, regardless of how many triplets
are present.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All three forms of limiters are
effective only when postfix-logwatch&rsquo;s detail level is
5 or greater (the Detailed section is not activated until
detail is at least 5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See the EXAMPLES section for
usage scenarios.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION FILE <br>
Postfix-logwatch can read configuration settings from a
configuration file. Essentially, any command line option can
be placed into a configuration file, and these settings are
<br>
read upon startup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Because postfix-logwatch can run
either standalone or within Logwatch, to minimize confusion,
postfix-logwatch inherits Logwatch&rsquo;s configuration
file syntax requirements and con&acirc; <br>
ventions. These are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; White space
lines are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Lines beginning
with # are ignored</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Settings are of
the form:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">option = value</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Spaces or tabs
on either side of the = character are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Any value
protected in double quotes will be case-preserved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; All other
content is reduced to lowercase (non-preserving, case
insensitive).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; All
postfix-logwatch configuration settings must be prefixed
with &quot;$postfix_&quot; or postfix-logwatch will ignore
them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; When running
under Logwatch, any values not prefixed with
&quot;$postfix_&quot; are consumed by Logwatch; it only
passes to postfix-logwatch (via environment variable)
settings it con&acirc; <br>
siders valid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The values True
and Yes are converted to 1, and False and No are converted
to 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Order of
settings is not preserved within a configuration file (since
settings are passed by Logwatch via environment variables,
which have no defined order).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To include a command line option
in a configuration file, prefix the command line option name
with the word &quot;$postfix_&quot;. The following
configuration file setting and command <br>
line option are equivalent:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$postfix_Line_Style =
Truncate</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--line_style Truncate</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Level limiters are also prefixed
with $postfix_, but on the command line are specified with
the --limit option:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$postfix_Sent = 2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--limit Sent=2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The order of command line
options and configuration file processing occurs as follows:
1) The default configuration file is read if it exists and
no --config_file was specified <br>
on a command line. 2) Configuration files are read and
processed in the order found on the command line. 3) Command
line options override any options already set either via
<br>
command line or from any configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Command line options are
interpreted when they are seen on the command line, and
later options will override previously set options. The
notable exception is with limiter vari&acirc; <br>
ables, which are interpreted in the order found, but only
after all other options have been processed. This allows
--reject_reply_patterns to determine the dynamic list of the
<br>
various reject limiters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See also
--reject_reply_patterns.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The postfix-logwatch utility exits with a status code of 0,
unless an error occurred, in which case a non-zero exit
status is returned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Running Standalone <br>
Note: postfix-logwatch reads its log data from one or more
named Postfix log files, or from STDIN. For brevity, where
required, the examples below use the word file as the
com&acirc; <br>
mand line argument meaning /path/to/postfix.log. Obviously
you will need to substitute file with the appropriate
path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To run postfix-logwatch in
standalone mode, simply run:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">postfix-logwatch file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A complete list of options and
basic usage is available via:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">postfix-logwatch --help</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To print a summary only report
of Postfix log data:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">postfix-logwatch --detail 1
file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To produce a summary report and
a one-level detail report for May 25th:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">grep &rsquo;May 25&rsquo; file |
postfix-logwatch --detail 5</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To produce only a top 10 list of
Sent email domains, the summary report and detailed reports
are first disabled. Since commands line options are read and
enabled left-to-right, <br>
the Sent section is re-enabled to level 1 with a level 1 top
10 limiter:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">postfix-logwatch --nosummary
--nodetail --limit sent=&rsquo;1 1:10:&rsquo; file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following command and its
sample output shows a more complex level limiter example.
The command gives the top 3 Sent email addresses from the
top 5 domains, in addition, all <br>
level 3 items with a hit count of 2 or less are suppressed
(in the Sent sub-section, this happens to be email&rsquo;s
Original To address). Ellipses indicate top N or
threshold-lim&acirc; <br>
ited data:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">postfix-logwatch --nosummary
--nodetail --limit sent &rsquo;1:5: 2:3: 3::2&rsquo;
file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1762 Sent via SMTP

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Running within Logwatch <br>
Note: Logwatch versions prior to 7.3.6, unless configured
otherwise, required the --print option to print to STDOUT
instead of sending reports via email. Since version 7.3.6,
<br>
STDOUT is the default output destination, and the --print
option has been replaced by --output stdout. Check your
configuration to determine where report output will be
directed, <br>
and add the appropriate option to the commands below.</p>
