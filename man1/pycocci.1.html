<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pycocci - Coccinelle wrapper for SmPL patch development</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pycocci [-h | --help] [-p |
--profile-cocci] [-j | --jobs &lt;job-digit&gt; ] [-v |
--verbose] [-s | --show-proof] &lt;SmPL-patch.cocci&gt;
&lt;target&gt; ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
pycocci is wrapper around spatch, it enables a set of
default arguments and also uses a bit of heuristics to
infers which arguments you likely want enabled. It takes two
argu&acirc; <br>
ments, the &lt;SmPL-patch.cocci&gt; and your &lt;target&gt;
which can either be a directory or file. The actual command
run is always displayed on standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Coccinelle spatch is a very rich
tool, it provides a large set of features for use with the
Coccinelle engine. Typical day to day SmPL patch development
may only require a base <br>
set of features though, we can also infer a set of features
depending on your target. pycocci enables a set of flags
which over time have been determined to be required for day
<br>
to day Linux kernel development, for instance through a
cronjob, it also uses a set of heuristics to infer a set of
arguments to use depending on your release of Coccinelle.
<br>
pycocci also checks to see which version of Coccinelle you
have installed and looks to enable arguments depending on
what version of Coccinelle you have installed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pycocci can also be used to help
write and verify SmPL patches when replacing a regular patch
series. pycocci checks the version of spatch installed and
based on this enables a <br>
set of features. This man page will document what options it
always enables by default, why it has done this and it will
also document the heuristics used and logic behind them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEFAULT ARGUMENTS <br>
By default pycocci will always enable when running
spatch:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--in-place</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--recursive-includes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--relax-include-path</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--timeout 120</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dir &lt;target&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The --in-place option is enabled
by default as most development these days happens on version
control systems and built-in version control systems can
typically display differ&acirc; <br>
ences better.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--relax-include-path and
--relax-include-path are enabled by default given that at
least for Linux kernel development some C files tend to
include headers in paths only specified <br>
by a target&rsquo;s Makefile through utilities such as
subdir-ccflags or ccflags-y making it difficult to ensure
all required header files are read by Coccinelle. We are
agressive with <br>
headers search and inclusion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A default timeout of 120 seconds
is used by default. Not using a timeout is typically not a
good idea. The value of 120 is used by default and is
considered significantly large <br>
enough to support most SmPL patches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">We make use of --dir to enable
use of a target directory and its subdirectories
recursively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MULTITHREAD ARGUMENT HEURISTICS
<br>
Coccinelle spatch prior to release 1.0.0 provided support
for multithreading but required the developer to spawn each
thread on their own, and provide an index reference number
<br>
identifying each thread. Coccinelle would divide the amount
of work required to be done and based on the index grant the
thread a specific set of work. Some shell scripts could <br>
be used to help split the work out for you. pycocci was
originally written to supercede these scripts and use
Python&rsquo;s multithreaded support, while also enabling
some sensible <br>
arguments by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you have a version of spatch
older than 1.0.2 pycocci will provide its own built-in
multithreaded batched solution, the spatch --jobs argument
is enabled on spatch &gt;= 1.0.2. <br>
The spatch --jobs arguments takes advantage of
Coccinelle&rsquo;s built-in paramap support, and
performance-wise yields better results than pycocci&rsquo;s
multithreaded solution. The number <br>
of threads used will always default to the number of number
of CPUs on your system, this is taken from what Python
multiprocessing.cpu_count() returns. You can override the
num&acirc; <br>
ber of threads pycocci will use with the --jobs
argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INDEXING ARGUMENT HEURISTICS
<br>
Coccinelle pycocci supports using a series of indexing
alternatives:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--use-glimpse</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--use-gitgrep</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--use-coccigrep</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Coccinelle puts the onus of
which indexing feature to enable on the developer. pycocci
will figure things out for you and make sure that only
supported options are used in spe&acirc; <br>
cific supported releases of coccinelle. So for instance,
although --use-gitgrep has been available on 1.0.1 pycocci
will only it on 1.0.2. The order of preference for what
index&acirc; <br>
ing option to uses the following heuristics: If your target
directory has a .glimpse_index file we assume you will want
to use --use-glimpse. Glimpse is now released under the <br>
ISC license and performance-wise is known to work as the
best indexing alternative, this is why we always check for a
glimpse index first. This heuristic is however limited, you
<br>
need the target path to be the base directory where the
.glimpse_index file exists, otherwise pycocci will not
recurse below on sub-directories. If we determine glimpse
cannot be <br>
used then pycocci will use git rev-parse --toplevel on the
specified path to determine if the provided path is part of
a git directory to enable --use-gitgrep. Although coc&acirc;
<br>
cinelle provides a fail-safe mechanism to enable use of
--use-gitgrep and fall back onto --use-coccigrep if a git
tree is not used, we avoid the failure case ahead of time.
<br>
pycocci will be tuned through each release to infer the best
indexing option known to use on your target path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Further information about spatch
is available at http://coccinelle.lip6.fr/.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Here is a summary of the options available on pycocci:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pycocci [-h | --help] [-p | --profile-cocci] [-j | --jobs]
[-v | --verbose] [-s | --show-proof] &lt;SmPL patch&gt;
&lt;target&gt; ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h | --help <br>
print short help menu</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">p | --profile-cocci <br>
Profile the &lt;SmPL patch&gt; when run against
&lt;target&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">j | --jobs &lt;job-digit&gt;
<br>
Override the default number of jobs to use with
&lt;job-digit&gt;. You really only need this if the
heuristics for the default number of jobs is determined to
be incorrect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">v | --verbose <br>
Output all possible information when run. By default pycocci
will provide no output unless an error is found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">s | --show-proof <br>
Show that the &lt;SmPL-patch.cocci&gt; can replace a series
of patches. The &lt;SmPL-patch.cocci&gt; must have a .cocci
postfix. A series of patches are expected to exist in the
<br>
directory named after the &lt;SmPL-patch.cocci&gt; with the
.cocci postfix removed. pycocci will use git in order to
show a proof of equivalence between the two. A new git <br>
branch will be created and used to apply the series of
patches (&quot;pycocci-patch-8-random-chars&quot;) onto the
&lt;target&gt;, another git branch will be created and used
to apply the <br>
&lt;SmPL-patch.cocci&gt;
(&quot;pycocci-smpl-8-random-chars&quot;). pycocci will
display name of the newly created branches and finally
provide the output of git diff --stat &lt;pycocci- <br>

patch-8-random-chars&gt;..&lt;pycocci-smpl-8-random-chars&gt;.
You should see no changes, and therefore a perfect SmPL
patch equivalence, when the diffstat on the ouput shows no
<br>
changes. The way to interpet a positive diffstat is that the
&lt;SmPL-patch.cocci&gt; is introducing more changes than
the patch series. The way to interpret a negative diffstat
<br>
is that the &lt;SmPL-patch.cocci&gt; is lacking some changes
in place on the patch series. pycocci will use git rev-parse
--toplevel against the &lt;target&gt; to see if the
&lt;target&gt; <br>
is part of a git tree. If the &lt;target&gt; is not part of
a git tree a git tree is created for you on &lt;target&gt;
if &lt;target&gt; is a directory or on the base directory of
&lt;target&gt; <br>
if &lt;target&gt; is a file. pycocci will return you to the
branch previously set on the &lt;target&gt; if one was
previously set, otherwise if a new git tree was created for
you <br>
pycocci will set the tree back to the master branch. Each
run of pycocci --show-proof will create two new git
branches. 8 random characters are postixed to each new git
<br>
branch created to avoid conflicts with previous runs.</p>
