git-rerere - Reuse recorded resolution of conflicted merges

In a workflow employing relatively long lived topic branches, the developer
  sometimes needs to resolve the same conflicts over and over again until the
  topic branches are done (either merged to the &quot;release&quot; branch, or
  sent out and accepted upstream).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This command assists the developer in this process by recording conflicted
  automerge results and corresponding hand resolve results on the initial manual
  merge, and applying previously recorded hand resolutions to their
  corresponding automerge results.

Normally, <i>git rerere</i> is run without arguments or user-intervention.
  However, it has several commands that allow it to interact with its working
  state.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>clear</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Reset the metadata used by rerere if a merge
  resolution is to be aborted. Calling <i>git am [--skip|--abort]</i> or <i>git
  rebase [--skip|--abort]</i> will automatically invoke this command.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>forget</i> &lt;pathspec&gt;
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Reset the conflict resolutions which rerere
  has recorded for the current conflict in &lt;pathspec&gt;.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>diff</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Display diffs for the current state of the
  resolution. It is useful for tracking what has changed while the user is
  resolving conflicts. Additional arguments are passed directly to the system
  <i>diff</i> command installed in PATH.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>status</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Print paths with conflicts whose merge
  resolution rerere will record.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>remaining</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Print paths with conflicts that have not been
  autoresolved by rerere. This includes paths whose resolutions cannot be
  tracked by rerere, such as conflicting submodules.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>gc</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Prune records of conflicted merges that
  occurred a long time ago. By default, unresolved conflicts older than 15 days
  and resolved conflicts older than 60 days are pruned. These defaults are
  controlled via the gc.rerereunresolved and gc.rerereresolved configuration
  variables respectively.</div>

When your topic branch modifies an overlapping area that your master branch (or
  upstream) touched since your topic branch forked from it, you may want to test
  it with the latest master, even before your topic branch is ready to be pushed
  upstream:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<pre>
              o---*---o topic
             /
    o---o---o---*---o---o master
</pre>
</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
For such a test, you need to merge master and topic somehow. One way to do it is
  to pull master into the topic branch:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<pre>
        $ git checkout topic
        $ git merge master
<div class="Pp"></div>
              o---*---o---+ topic
             /           /
    o---o---o---*---o---o master
</pre>
</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The commits marked with * touch the same area in the same file; you need to
  resolve the conflicts when creating the commit marked with +. Then you can
  test the result to make sure your work-in-progress still works with what is in
  the latest master.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
After this test merge, there are two ways to continue your work on the topic.
  The easiest is to build on top of the test merge commit +, and when your work
  in the topic branch is finally ready, pull the topic branch into master,
  and/or ask the upstream to pull from you. By that time, however, the master or
  the upstream might have been advanced since the test merge +, in which case
  the final commit graph would look like this:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<pre>
        $ git checkout topic
        $ git merge master
        $ ... work on both topic and master branches
        $ git checkout master
        $ git merge topic
<div class="Pp"></div>
              o---*---o---+---o---o topic
             /           /         \
    o---o---o---*---o---o---o---o---+ master
</pre>
</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
When your topic branch is long-lived, however, your topic branch would end up
  having many such &quot;Merge from master&quot; commits on it, which would
  unnecessarily clutter the development history. Readers of the Linux kernel
  mailing list may remember that Linus complained about such too frequent test
  merges when a subsystem maintainer asked to pull from a branch full of
  &quot;useless merges&quot;.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
As an alternative, to keep the topic branch clean of test merges, you could blow
  away the test merge, and keep building on top of the tip before the test
  merge:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<pre>
        $ git checkout topic
        $ git merge master
        $ git reset --hard HEAD^ ;# rewind the test merge
        $ ... work on both topic and master branches
        $ git checkout master
        $ git merge topic
<div class="Pp"></div>
              o---*---o-------o---o topic
             /                     \
    o---o---o---*---o---o---o---o---+ master
</pre>
</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This would leave only one merge commit when your topic branch is finally ready
  and merged into the master branch. This merge would require you to resolve the
  conflict, introduced by the commits marked with *. However, this conflict is
  often the same conflict you resolved when you created the test merge you blew
  away. <i>git rerere</i> helps you resolve this final conflicted merge using
  the information from your earlier hand resolve.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Running the <i>git rerere</i> command immediately after a conflicted automerge
  records the conflicted working tree files, with the usual conflict markers
  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;, =======, and &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in
  them. Later, after you are done resolving the conflicts, running <i>git
  rerere</i> again will record the resolved state of these files. Suppose you
  did this when you created the test merge of master into the topic branch.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Next time, after seeing the same conflicted automerge, running <i>git rerere</i>
  will perform a three-way merge between the earlier conflicted automerge, the
  earlier manual resolution, and the current conflicted automerge. If this
  three-way merge resolves cleanly, the result is written out to your working
  tree file, so you do not have to manually resolve it. Note that <i>git
  rerere</i> leaves the index file alone, so you still need to do the final
  sanity checks with git diff (or git diff -c) and <i>git add</i> when you are
  satisfied.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
As a convenience measure, <i>git merge</i> automatically invokes <i>git
  rerere</i> upon exiting with a failed automerge and <i>git rerere</i> records
  the hand resolve when it is a new conflict, or reuses the earlier hand resolve
  when it is not. <i>git commit</i> also invokes <i>git rerere</i> when
  committing a merge result. What this means is that you do not have to do
  anything special yourself (besides enabling the rerere.enabled config
  variable).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
In our example, when you do the test merge, the manual resolution is recorded,
  and it will be reused when you do the actual merge later with the updated
  master and topic branch, as long as the recorded resolution is still
  applicable.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The information <i>git rerere</i> records is also used when running <i>git
  rebase</i>. After blowing away the test merge and continuing development on
  the topic branch:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<pre>
              o---*---o-------o---o topic
             /
    o---o---o---*---o---o---o---o   master
<div class="Pp"></div>
        $ git rebase master topic
<div class="Pp"></div>
                                  o---*---o-------o---o topic
                                 /
    o---o---o---*---o---o---o---o   master
</pre>
</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
you could run git rebase master topic, to bring yourself up-to-date before your
  topic is ready to be sent upstream. This would result in falling back to a
  three-way merge, and it would conflict the same way as the test merge you
  resolved earlier. <i>git rerere</i> will be run by <i>git rebase</i> to help
  you resolve this conflict.
