<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
AWFFull - A Webalizer Fork, Full o&rsquo; features</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
awffull [...] [log-file]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
AWFFull is a web server log analysis program based on The
Webalizer. AWFFull produces usage statistics in HTML format
for viewing with a browser. The results are presented in
<br>
both columnar and graphical format, which facilitates
interpretation. Yearly, monthly, daily and hourly usage
statistics are presented, along with the ability to display
usage by <br>
site, URL, referrer, user agent (browser), user name, search
strings, entry/exit pages, and country (some information may
not be available if not present in the log file being <br>
processed).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AWFFull supports the following
log formats shown in the following variable list:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CLF (common log format) log
files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Combined <br>
log formats as defined by NCSA and others, and variations of
these which it attempts to handle intelligently</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xferlog <br>
wu-ftpd formatted log files allowing analysis of ftp
servers, and squid proxy logs. <br>
Note</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Logs may also be compressed, via
gzip. If a compressed log file is detected, it will be
automatically uncompressed while it is read. Compressed logs
must have the standard <br>
gzip extension of .gz.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This documentation applies to
AWFFull Version 3.8.2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CHANGES FROM WEBALIZER <br>
AWFFull is based on The Webalizer code and has a number of
large and small changes. These include:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Additional changes and
improvements are planned and undergoing implementation. See
the TODO file for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NEW REPORT MEASUREMENTS <br>
With version 3.8.1 of AWFFull, several new measured results
have been added to the detailed report monthly page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Single Access <br>
Single Access Pages - the only page seen within a given
visit</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Stickiness <br>
How useful a given entry page is to draw Visitors deeper
into your site</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Popularity <br>
The Ratio of Page Entries to Page Exits</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These metrics can help towards
improving insight in the usage of the processed web site.
And hence allow the site owner to make positive change to
make the site more useful to <br>
site visitors. All three metrics appear in the &acirc;Entry
Pages&acirc; Report. &acirc;Popularity&acirc; is also on the
&acirc;Exit Pages&acirc; Report.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Single Access</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">More completely: &acirc;Single
Access Pages&acirc;. This is a report on the number of times
that a given page was the only page viewed within a Visit.
Or in English, Someone came to your <br>
website. They only viewed one page. The number is the
cumulative count of people who did this for that particular
page. Why is this useful? Identifying those entry pages that
<br>
don&rsquo;t draw visitors deeper into your site. Or seeing
entry pages that shouldn&rsquo;t be entry pages. It&rsquo;s
also a reality check against the next two values which are
calculated from <br>
this number. The number generated should be a subset of the
&acirc;Entry Page Views&acirc; and/or &acirc;Exit Page
Views&acirc; metric. If it isn&rsquo;t? Let me know, we have
a bug. :-)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Stickiness</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Is calculated as 1 - (Single
Access / Entry Page Views) expressed as a percentage. In
essence Stickiness describes how useful a given entry page
is to draw Visitors deeper into <br>
your site. The stickier the page, the more folk are caught
by it. :-) The closer to 100% the better. Generally. Certain
pages within YOUR website may not make sense to have a <br>
high stickiness or even &gt; 5%. This measurement is a clue
to understanding how your site is used, it is not a rule.
How is this useful? How and where are people entering your
web <br>
site. Does that make sense? Should it be here or there? What
can you change to fix this and hence improve their use of
your website.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Popularity</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Popularity is the Ratio of Page
Entries to Page Exits. o If it equals 1.0? Then the number
of visitors to your site who started with that page, equals
the number who left at that <br>
page. o If greater then 1.0, then more people entered here
then left. o If less then 0? More people left from here then
entered. I personally find this metric one of the more <br>
useful &quot;At a Glance: How are Pages Performing&quot;
metrics. One of the difficulties with using this particular
metric is that certain numbers will NOT make sense for YOUR
site. In <br>
that a natural exit page would expect to have a very low
Popularity. It&rsquo;s an exit page, not an entry page. So
if an exit page has a high popularity, then you have a real
problem. <br>
Likewise, a low Popularity for an entry page is unlikely to
be a Good Thing(tm).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;Where &amp; Why?&quot; All
three of these metrics are covered very nicely in Hack #58
from &quot;Web Site Measurement Hacks&quot; [1]. Which is
where, credit where credit due, the inspiration to <br>
add these metrics came from.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RUNNING AWFFULL <br>
AWFFull is designed to be run from a Unix command line
prompt or as a crond(8) job. There is no need to run with
super-user privleges, and indeed, is preferable NOT to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once executed, the general flow
of the program is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A default configuration file is
scanned for, /etc/awffull/awffull.conf and, if found, is
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any command line arguments given
to the program are parsed. This may include the
specification of one or more configuration files, which are
processed at the time it is encoun&acirc; <br>
tered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It can be useful to have
multiple config files. A master used for multiple sites, and
individualised config files. Do be aware that last option
set wins. So last config file, or <br>
if after a config file, command line options. Useful if you
desire to send the output to an alternate directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a log file was specified, it
is opened and made ready for processing. If no log file was
given, STDIN is used for input. If the log filename
&rsquo;-&rsquo; is specified, STDIN will be <br>
forced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If an output directory was
specified, AWFFull changes to that directory in preparation
for generating output. If no output directory was given, the
current directory is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no hostname was given, the
program attempts to get the hostname using a uname(2) system
call. If that fails, localhost is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A history file is searched for
in the current directory (output directory) and read if
found. This file keeps totals for previous months, which is
used in the main index.html <br>
HTML document. Note: The file location can now be specified
with the HistoryName configuration option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If incremental processing was
specified, a data file is searched for and loaded if found,
containing the &rsquo;internal state&rsquo; data of the
program at the end of a previous run. Note: <br>
The file location can now be specified with the
IncrementalName configuration option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Main processing begins on the
log file. If the log spans multiple months, a separate HTML
document is created for each month. After main processing,
the main index.html page is <br>
created, which has totals by month and links to each months
HTML document.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A new history file is saved to
disk, which includes totals generated by AWFFull during the
current run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If incremental processing was
specified, a data file is written that contains the
&rsquo;internal state&rsquo; data at the end of this
run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INCREMENTAL PROCESSING <br>
Version 1.2x of The Webalizer added incremental run
capability. Simply put, this allows processing large log
files by breaking them up into smaller pieces, and
processing these <br>
pieces instead. What this means in real terms is that you
can now rotate your log files as often as you want, and
still be able to produce monthly usage statistics without
the <br>
loss of any detail. Basically, AWFFull saves and restores
all internal data in a file named awffull.current. This
allows the program to &rsquo;start where it left off&rsquo;
so to speak, and <br>
allows the preservation of detail from one run to the next.
The data file is placed in the current output directory, and
is a plain ASCII text file that can be viewed with any <br>
standard text editor. It&rsquo;s location and name may be
changed using the IncrementalName configuration keyword.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some special precautions need to
be taken when using the incremental run capability of
AWFFull. Configuration options should not be changed between
runs, as that could cause cor&acirc; <br>
ruption of the internal data stored. For example, changing
the MangleAgents level will cause different representations
of user agents to be stored, producing invalid results in
<br>
the user agents section of the report. If you need to change
configuration options, do it at the end of the month after
normal processing of the previous month and before
pro&acirc; <br>
cessing the current month. You may also want to delete the
awffull.current file as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AWFFull also attempts to prevent
data duplication by keeping track of the timestamp of the
last record processed. This timestamp is then compared to
current records being pro&acirc; <br>
cessed, and any records that were logged previous to that
timestamp are ignored. This, in theory, should allow you to
re-process logs that have already been processed, or process
<br>
logs that contain a mix of processed/not yet processed
records, and not produce duplication of statistics.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The only time this may break is
if you have duplicate timestamps in two separate log files.
Any records in the second log file that do have the same
timestamp as the last record <br>
in the previous log file processed, will be discarded as if
they had already been processed. There are lots of ways to
prevent this however, for example, stopping the web server
<br>
before rotating logs will prevent this situation, or using a
tool such as cronolog
(&acirc;&uml;http://cronolog.org/&acirc;&copy;). This setup
also necessitates that you always process logs in
chrono&acirc; <br>
logical order, otherwise data loss will occur as a result of
the timestamp compare.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REVERSE DNS LOOKUPS <br>
AWFFull no longer supports DNS lookups. Please use an
external program such as DNShistory or DNSTran instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&acirc;&uml;http://www.stedee.id.au/dnshistory&acirc;&copy;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With version 3.7.1 of AWFFull,
GeoIP capability can be used for improved country
detection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMAND LINE OPTIONS <br>
AWFFull supports many different configuration options that
will alter the way the program behaves and generates output.
Most of these can be specified on the command line, while
<br>
some can only be specified in a configuration file. The
command line options are listed below, with references to
the corresponding configuration file keywords. See also

accurate detection of countries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE! Do not enable GeoIP if you
analyse files that have had the IP Address translated to a
Fully Qualified Host Name. Use either raw IP Addresses and
GeoIP, or Names and <br>
disable GeoIP. ie. Don&rsquo;t use GeoIP AND DNShistory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--match_counts <br>
Display the various Group/Hide etc Match Counts. This option
is ideal for optimisation of the awffull.conf file. Just be
careful with optimising Agents in particular, as <br>
the order is typically important.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION FILES <br>
See the awffull.conf(5) man page for complete details of all
configuration options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Configuration files are standard
ASCII(7) text files that may be created or edited using any
standard editor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Blank lines and lines that begin
with a pound sign (&rsquo;#&rsquo;) are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any other lines are considered
to be configuration lines, and have the form &acirc;Keyword
Value&acirc;, where the &acirc;Keyword&acirc; is one of the
currently available configuration keywords (see <br>
awffull.conf(5)), and &acirc;Value&acirc; is the value to
assign to that particular option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any text found after the keyword
up to the end of the line is considered the keyword&rsquo;s
value, so you should not include anything after the actual
value on the line that is not <br>
actually part of the value being assigned. The file
sample.conf provided with the distribution contains lots of
useful documentation and examples as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Certain &quot;Keywords&quot;
will accept a 2nd value. In those situations, the first
value may be enclosed in double quotes (&quot;) to allow for
whitespace.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
awffull.conf(5)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
None currently known. YMMV....</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
In case it is not obvious: AWFFull is a play/pun on the word
&acirc;awful&acirc;, and is pronounced the same way. Yes it
was deliberate.</p>
