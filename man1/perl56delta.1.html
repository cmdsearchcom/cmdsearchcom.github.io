<p>PERL56DELTA(1) Perl Programmers Reference Guide
PERL56DELTA(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
perl56delta - what&rsquo;s new for perl v5.6.0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This document describes differences between the 5.005
release and the 5.6.0 release.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Core Enhancements <br>
Interpreter cloning, threads, and concurrency <br>
Perl 5.6.0 introduces the beginnings of support for running
multiple interpreters concurrently in different threads. In
conjunction with the perl_clone() API call, which can be
<br>
used to selectively duplicate the state of any given
interpreter, it is possible to compile a piece of code once
in an interpreter, clone that interpreter one or more times,
and <br>
run all the resulting interpreters in distinct threads.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On the Windows platform, this
feature is used to emulate fork() at the interpreter level.
See perlfork for details about that.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This feature is still in
evolution. It is eventually meant to be used to selectively
clone a subroutine and data reachable from that subroutine
in a separate interpreter and run <br>
the cloned subroutine in a separate thread. Since there is
no shared data between the interpreters, little or no
locking will be needed (unless parts of the symbol table are
<br>
explicitly shared). This is obviously intended to be an
easy-to-use replacement for the existing threads
support.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Support for cloning interpreters
and interpreter concurrency can be enabled using the
-Dusethreads Configure option (see win32/Makefile for how to
enable it on Windows.) The <br>
resulting perl executable will be functionally identical to
one that was built with -Dmultiplicity, but the perl_clone()
API call will only be available in the former.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Dusethreads enables the cpp
macro USE_ITHREADS by default, which in turn enables Perl
source code changes that provide a clear separation between
the op tree and the data it <br>
operates with. The former is immutable, and can therefore be
shared between an interpreter and all of its clones, while
the latter is considered local to each interpreter, and <br>
is therefore copied for each clone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that building Perl with the
-Dusemultiplicity Configure option is adequate if you wish
to run multiple independent interpreters concurrently in
different threads. <br>
-Dusethreads only provides the additional functionality of
the perl_clone() API call and other support for running
cloned interpreters concurrently.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: This is an experimental
feature. Implementation details are <br>
subject to change.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Lexically scoped warning
categories <br>
You can now control the granularity of warnings emitted by
perl at a finer level using the &quot;use warnings&quot;
pragma. warnings and perllexwarn have copious documentation
on this <br>
feature.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unicode and UTF-8 support <br>
Perl now uses UTF-8 as its internal representation for
character strings. The &quot;utf8&quot; and
&quot;bytes&quot; pragmas are used to control this support
in the current lexical scope. See <br>
perlunicode, utf8 and bytes for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This feature is expected to
evolve quickly to support some form of I/O disciplines that
can be used to specify the kind of input and output data
(bytes or characters). Until <br>
that happens, additional modules from CPAN will be needed to
complete the toolkit for dealing with Unicode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: This should be considered
an experimental feature. Implementation <br>
details are subject to change.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Support for interpolating named
characters <br>
The new &quot;scape interpolates named characters within
strings. For example, &quot;Hi! HITE SMILING FACE}&quot;
evaluates to a string with a unicode smiley face at the
end.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;our&quot; declarations
<br>
An &quot;our&quot; declaration introduces a value that can
be best understood as a lexically scoped symbolic alias to a
global variable in the package that was current where the
variable <br>
was declared. This is mostly useful as an alternative to the
&quot;vars&quot; pragma, but also provides the opportunity
to introduce typing and other attributes for such variables.
See <br>
&quot;our&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Support for strings represented
as a vector of ordinals <br>
Literals of the form &quot;v1.2.3.4&quot; are now parsed as
a string composed of characters with the specified ordinals.
This is an alternative, more readable way to construct
(possibly <br>
unicode) strings instead of interpolating characters, as in
&quot;&quot;. The leading &quot;v&quot; may be omitted if
there are more than two ordinals, so 1.2.3 is parsed the
<br>
same as &quot;v1.2.3&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Strings written in this form are
also useful to represent version &quot;numbers&quot;. It is
easy to compare such version &quot;numbers&quot; (which are
really just plain strings) using any of the <br>
usual string comparison operators &quot;eq&quot;,
&quot;ne&quot;, &quot;lt&quot;, &quot;gt&quot;, etc., or
perform bitwise string operations on them using
&quot;|&quot;, &quot;&amp;&quot;, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In conjunction with the new $^V
magic variable (which contains the perl version as a
string), such literals can be used as a readable way to
check if you&rsquo;re running a particular <br>
version of Perl:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># this will parse in older
versions of Perl also <br>
if ($^V and $^V gt v5.6.0) { <br>
# new features supported <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;require&quot; and
&quot;use&quot; also have some special magic to support such
literals, but this particular usage should be avoided
because it leads to misleading error messages under <br>
versions of Perl which don&rsquo;t support vector strings.
Using a true version number will ensure correct behavior in
all versions of Perl:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">require 5.006; # run time check
for v5.6 <br>
use 5.006_001; # compile time check for v5.6.1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also, &quot;sprintf&quot; and
&quot;printf&quot; support the Perl-specific format flag %v
to print ordinals of characters in arbitrary strings:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">printf &quot;v%vd&quot;, $^V; #
prints current version, such as &quot;v5.5.650&quot; <br>
printf &quot;%*vX&quot;, &quot;:&quot;, $addr; # formats
IPv6 address <br>
printf &quot;%*vb&quot;, &quot; &quot;, $bits; # displays
bitstring</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See &quot;Scalar value
constructors&quot; in perldata for additional
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Improved Perl version numbering
system <br>
Beginning with Perl version 5.6.0, the version number
convention has been changed to a &quot;dotted integer&quot;
scheme that is more commonly found in open source
projects.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Maintenance versions of v5.6.0
will be released as v5.6.1, v5.6.2 etc. The next development
series following v5.6.0 will be numbered v5.7.x, beginning
with v5.7.0, and the next <br>
major production release following v5.6.0 will be
v5.8.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The English module now sets
$PERL_VERSION to $^V (a string value) rather than $] (a
numeric value). (This is a potential incompatibility. Send
us a report via perlbug if you <br>
are affected by this.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The v1.2.3 syntax is also now
legal in Perl. See &quot;Support for strings represented as
a vector of ordinals&quot; for more on that.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To cope with the new versioning
system&rsquo;s use of at least three significant digits for
each version component, the method used for incrementing the
subversion number has also <br>
changed slightly. We assume that versions older than v5.6.0
have been incrementing the subversion component in multiples
of 10. Versions after v5.6.0 will increment them by 1. <br>
Thus, using the new notation, 5.005_03 is the
&quot;same&quot; as v5.5.30, and the first maintenance
version following v5.6.0 will be v5.6.1 (which should be
read as being equivalent to a <br>
floating point value of 5.006_001 in the older format,
stored in $]).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">New syntax for declaring
subroutine attributes <br>
Formerly, if you wanted to mark a subroutine as being a
method call or as requiring an automatic lock() when it is
entered, you had to declare that with a &quot;use
attrs&quot; pragma in <br>
the body of the subroutine. That can now be accomplished
with declaration syntax, like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sub mymethod : locked method;
<br>
... <br>
sub mymethod : locked method { <br>
... <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sub othermethod :locked :method;
<br>
... <br>
sub othermethod :locked :method { <br>
... <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(Note how only the first
&quot;:&quot; is mandatory, and whitespace surrounding the
&quot;:&quot; is optional.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AutoSplit.pm and SelfLoader.pm
have been updated to keep the attributes with the stubs they
provide. See attributes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File and directory handles can
be autovivified <br>
Similar to how constructs such as &quot;$x-&gt;[0]&quot;
autovivify a reference, handle constructors (open(),
opendir(), pipe(), socketpair(), sysopen(), socket(), and
accept()) now <br>
autovivify a file or directory handle if the handle passed
to them is an uninitialized scalar variable. This allows the
constructs such as &quot;open(my $fh, ...)&quot; and
&quot;open(local <br>
$fh,...)&quot; to be used to create filehandles that will
conveniently be closed automatically when the scope ends,
provided there are no other references to them. This largely
<br>
eliminates the need for typeglobs when opening filehandles
that must be passed around, as in the following example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sub myopen { <br>
open my $fh, &quot;@_&quot; <br>
or die &quot;Can&rsquo;t open &rsquo;@_&rsquo;: $!&quot;;
<br>
return $fh; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">{ <br>
my $f = myopen(&quot;&lt;/etc/motd&quot;); <br>
print &lt;$f&gt;; <br>
# $f implicitly closed here <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">open() with more than two
arguments <br>
If open() is passed three arguments instead of two, the
second argument is used as the mode and the third argument
is taken to be the file name. This is primarily useful for
<br>
protecting against unintended magic behavior of the
traditional two-argument form. See &quot;open&quot; in
perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">64-bit support <br>
Any platform that has 64-bit integers either</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(1) natively as longs or ints
<br>
(2) via special compiler flags <br>
(3) using long long or int64_t</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">is able to use &quot;quads&quot;
(64-bit integers) as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; constants
(decimal, hexadecimal, octal, binary) in the code</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; arguments to
oct() and hex()</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; arguments to
print(), printf() and sprintf() (flag prefixes ll, L, q)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; printed as
such</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; pack() and
unpack() &quot;q&quot; and &quot;Q&quot; formats</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; in basic
arithmetics: + - * / % (NOTE: operating close to the limits
of the integer values may produce surprising results)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; in bit
arithmetics: &amp; | ^ ~ &lt;&lt; &gt;&gt; (NOTE: these used
to be forced to be 32 bits wide but now operate on the full
native width.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; vec()</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that unless you have the
case (a) you will have to configure and compile Perl using
the -Duse64bitint Configure flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: The Configure flags
-Duselonglong and -Duse64bits have been <br>
deprecated. Use -Duse64bitint instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are actually two modes of
64-bitness: the first one is achieved using Configure
-Duse64bitint and the second one using Configure
-Duse64bitall. The difference is that the <br>
first one is minimal and the second one maximal. The first
works in more places than the second.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;use64bitint&quot; does
only as much as is required to get 64-bit integers into Perl
(this may mean, for example, using &quot;long longs&quot;)
while your memory may still be limited to 2 <br>
gigabytes (because your pointers could still be 32-bit).
Note that the name &quot;64bitint&quot; does not imply that
your C compiler will be using 64-bit &quot;int&quot;s (it
might, but it doesn&rsquo;t <br>
have to): the &quot;use64bitint&quot; means that you will be
able to have 64 bits wide scalar values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;use64bitall&quot; goes
all the way by attempting to switch also integers (if it
can), longs (and pointers) to being 64-bit. This may create
an even more binary incompatible Perl <br>
than -Duse64bitint: the resulting executable may not run at
all in a 32-bit box, or you may have to
reboot/reconfigure/rebuild your operating system to be
64-bit aware.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Natively 64-bit systems like
Alpha and Cray need neither -Duse64bitint nor
-Duse64bitall.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Last but not least: note that
due to Perl&rsquo;s habit of always using floating point
numbers, the quads are still not true integers. When quads
overflow their limits <br>
(0...18_446_744_073_709_551_615 unsigned,
-9_223_372_036_854_775_808...9_223_372_036_854_775_807
signed), they are silently promoted to floating point
numbers, after which they <br>
will start losing precision (in their lower digits).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: 64-bit support is still
experimental on most platforms. <br>
Existing support only covers the LP64 data model. In
particular, the <br>
LLP64 data model is not yet supported. 64-bit libraries and
system <br>
APIs on many platforms have not stabilized--your mileage may
vary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Large file support <br>
If you have filesystems that support &quot;large files&quot;
(files larger than 2 gigabytes), you may now also be able to
create and access them from Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: The default action is to
enable large file support, if <br>
available on the platform.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the large file support is on,
and you have a Fcntl constant O_LARGEFILE, the O_LARGEFILE
is automatically added to the flags of sysopen().</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Beware that unless your
filesystem also supports &quot;sparse files&quot; seeking to
umpteen petabytes may be inadvisable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that in addition to
requiring a proper file system to do large files you may
also need to adjust your per-process (or your per-system, or
per-process-group, or per-user- <br>
group) maximum filesize limits before running Perl scripts
that try to handle large files, especially if you intend to
write such files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, in addition to your
process/process group maximum filesize limits, you may have
quota limits on your filesystems that stop you (your user id
or your user group id) from <br>
using large files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Adjusting your
process/user/group/file system/operating system limits is
outside the scope of Perl core language. For process limits,
you may try increasing the limits using <br>
your shell&rsquo;s limits/limit/ulimit command before
running Perl. The BSD::Resource extension (not included with
the standard Perl distribution) may also be of use, it
offers the <br>
getrlimit/setrlimit interface that can be used to adjust
process resource usage limits, including the maximum
filesize limit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Long doubles <br>
In some systems you may be able to use long doubles to
enhance the range and precision of your double precision
floating point numbers (that is, Perl&rsquo;s numbers). Use
Configure <br>
-Duselongdouble to enable this support (if it is
available).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;more bits&quot; <br>
You can &quot;Configure -Dusemorebits&quot; to turn on both
the 64-bit support and the long double support.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enhanced support for sort()
subroutines <br>
Perl subroutines with a prototype of &quot;($$)&quot;, and
XSUBs in general, can now be used as sort subroutines. In
either case, the two elements to be compared are passed as
normal <br>
parameters in @_. See &quot;sort&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For unprototyped sort
subroutines, the historical behavior of passing the elements
to be compared as the global variables $a and $b remains
unchanged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;sort $coderef @foo&quot;
allowed <br>
sort() did not accept a subroutine reference as the
comparison function in earlier versions. This is now
permitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File globbing implemented
internally <br>
Perl now uses the File::Glob implementation of the glob()
operator automatically. This avoids using an external csh
process and the problems associated with it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: This is currently an
experimental feature. Interfaces and <br>
implementation are subject to change.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Support for CHECK blocks <br>
In addition to &quot;BEGIN&quot;, &quot;INIT&quot;,
&quot;END&quot;, &quot;DESTROY&quot; and
&quot;AUTOLOAD&quot;, subroutines named &quot;CHECK&quot;
are now special. These are queued up during compilation and
behave similar to END <br>
blocks, except they are called at the end of compilation
rather than at the end of execution. They cannot be called
directly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">POSIX character class syntax [:
:] supported <br>
For example to match alphabetic characters use
/[[:alpha:]]/. See perlre for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Better pseudo-random number
generator <br>
In 5.005_0x and earlier, perl&rsquo;s rand() function used
the C library rand(3) function. As of 5.005_52, Configure
tests for drand48(), random(), and rand() (in that order)
and <br>
picks the first one it finds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These changes should result in
better random numbers from rand().</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Improved &quot;qw//&quot;
operator <br>
The &quot;qw//&quot; operator is now evaluated at compile
time into a true list instead of being replaced with a run
time call to &quot;split()&quot;. This removes the confusing
misbehaviour of <br>
&quot;qw//&quot; in scalar context, which had inherited that
behaviour from split().</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Thus:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$foo = ($bar) = qw(a b c); print
&quot;$foo|$bar0;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">now correctly prints
&quot;3|a&quot;, instead of &quot;2|a&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Better worst-case behavior of
hashes <br>
Small changes in the hashing algorithm have been implemented
in order to improve the distribution of lower order bits in
the hashed value. This is expected to yield better <br>
performance on keys that are repeated sequences.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pack() format &rsquo;Z&rsquo;
supported <br>
The new format type &rsquo;Z&rsquo; is useful for packing
and unpacking null-terminated strings. See &quot;pack&quot;
in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pack() format modifier
&rsquo;!&rsquo; supported <br>
The new format type modifier &rsquo;!&rsquo; is useful for
packing and unpacking native shorts, ints, and longs. See
&quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pack() and unpack() support
counted strings <br>
The template character &rsquo;/&rsquo; can be used to
specify a counted string type to be packed or unpacked. See
&quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Comments in pack() templates
<br>
The &rsquo;#&rsquo; character in a template introduces a
comment up to end of the line. This facilitates
documentation of pack() templates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Weak references <br>
In previous versions of Perl, you couldn&rsquo;t cache
objects so as to allow them to be deleted if the last
reference from outside the cache is deleted. The reference
in the cache <br>
would hold a reference count on the object and the objects
would never be destroyed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another familiar problem is with
circular references. When an object references itself, its
reference count would never go down to zero, and it would
not get destroyed until the <br>
program is about to exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Weak references solve this by
allowing you to &quot;weaken&quot; any reference, that is,
make it not count towards the reference count. When the last
non-weak reference to an object is <br>
deleted, the object is destroyed and all the weak references
to the object are automatically undef-ed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To use this feature, you need
the Devel::WeakRef package from CPAN, which contains
additional documentation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: This is an experimental
feature. Details are subject to change.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Binary numbers supported <br>
Binary numbers are now supported as literals, in s?printf
formats, and &quot;oct()&quot;:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$answer = 0b101010; <br>
printf &quot;The answer is: %b0,
oct(&quot;0b101010&quot;);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Lvalue subroutines <br>
Subroutines can now return modifiable lvalues. See
&quot;Lvalue subroutines&quot; in perlsub.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: This is an experimental
feature. Details are subject to change.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some arrows may be omitted in
calls through references <br>
Perl now allows the arrow to be omitted in many constructs
involving subroutine calls through references. For example,
&quot;$foo[10]-&gt;(&rsquo;foo&rsquo;)&quot; may now be
written &quot;$foo[10](&rsquo;foo&rsquo;)&quot;. <br>
This is rather similar to how the arrow may be omitted from
&quot;$foo[10]-&gt;{&rsquo;foo&rsquo;}&quot;. Note however,
that the arrow is still required for
&quot;foo(10)-&gt;(&rsquo;bar&rsquo;)&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Boolean assignment operators are
legal lvalues <br>
Constructs such as &quot;($a ||= 2) += 1&quot; are now
allowed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">exists() is supported on
subroutine names <br>
The exists() builtin now works on subroutine names. A
subroutine is considered to exist if it has been declared
(even if implicitly). See &quot;exists&quot; in perlfunc for
examples.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">exists() and delete() are
supported on array elements <br>
The exists() and delete() builtins now work on simple arrays
as well. The behavior is similar to that on hash
elements.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">exists() can be used to check
whether an array element has been initialized. This avoids
autovivifying array elements that don&rsquo;t exist. If the
array is tied, the EXISTS() <br>
method in the corresponding tied package will be
invoked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">delete() may be used to remove
an element from the array and return it. The array element
at that position returns to its uninitialized state, so that
testing for the same <br>
element with exists() will return false. If the element
happens to be the one at the end, the size of the array also
shrinks up to the highest element that tests true for <br>
exists(), or 0 if none such is found. If the array is tied,
the DELETE() method in the corresponding tied package will
be invoked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See &quot;exists&quot; in
perlfunc and &quot;delete&quot; in perlfunc for
examples.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pseudo-hashes work better <br>
Dereferencing some types of reference values in a
pseudo-hash, such as &quot;$ph-&gt;{foo}[1]&quot;, was
accidentally disallowed. This has been corrected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When applied to a pseudo-hash
element, exists() now reports whether the specified value
exists, not merely if the key is valid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">delete() now works on
pseudo-hashes. When given a pseudo-hash element or slice it
deletes the values corresponding to the keys (but not the
keys themselves). See &quot;Pseudo- <br>
hashes: Using an array as a hash&quot; in perlref.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pseudo-hash slices with constant
keys are now optimized to array lookups at compile-time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">List assignments to pseudo-hash
slices are now supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;fields&quot; pragma
now provides ways to create pseudo-hashes, via fields::new()
and fields::phash(). See fields.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: The pseudo-hash data type
continues to be experimental. <br>
Limiting oneself to the interface elements provided by the
<br>
fields pragma will provide protection from any future
changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Automatic flushing of output
buffers <br>
fork(), exec(), system(), qx//, and pipe open()s now flush
buffers of all files opened for output when the operation
was attempted. This mostly eliminates confusing buffering
<br>
mishaps suffered by users unaware of how Perl internally
handles I/O.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is not supported on some
platforms like Solaris where a suitably correct
implementation of fflush(NULL) isn&rsquo;t available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Better diagnostics on
meaningless filehandle operations <br>
Constructs such as &quot;open(&lt;FH&gt;)&quot; and
&quot;close(&lt;FH&gt;)&quot; are compile time errors.
Attempting to read from filehandles that were opened only
for writing will now produce warnings (just <br>
as writing to read-only filehandles does).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Where possible, buffered data
discarded from duped input filehandle <br>
&quot;open(NEW, &quot;&lt;&amp;OLD&quot;)&quot; now attempts
to discard any data that was previously read and buffered in
&quot;OLD&quot; before duping the handle. On platforms where
doing this is allowed, the next <br>
read operation on &quot;NEW&quot; will return the same data
as the corresponding operation on &quot;OLD&quot;. Formerly,
it would have returned the data from the start of the
following disk block <br>
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">eof() has the same old magic as
&lt;&gt; <br>
&quot;eof()&quot; would return true if no attempt to read
from &quot;&lt;&gt;&quot; had yet been made.
&quot;eof()&quot; has been changed to have a little magic of
its own, it now opens the &quot;&lt;&gt;&quot; files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">binmode() can be used to set
:crlf and :raw modes <br>
binmode() now accepts a second argument that specifies a
discipline for the handle in question. The two
pseudo-disciplines &quot;:raw&quot; and &quot;:crlf&quot;
are currently supported on DOS- <br>
derivative platforms. See &quot;binmode&quot; in perlfunc
and open.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;-T&quot; filetest
recognizes UTF-8 encoded files as &quot;text&quot; <br>
The algorithm used for the &quot;-T&quot; filetest has been
enhanced to correctly identify UTF-8 content as
&quot;text&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">system(), backticks and pipe
open now reflect exec() failure <br>
On Unix and similar platforms, system(), qx() and open(FOO,
&quot;cmd |&quot;) etc., are implemented via fork() and
exec(). When the underlying exec() fails, earlier versions
did not <br>
report the error properly, since the exec() happened to be
in a different process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The child process now
communicates with the parent about the error in launching
the external command, which allows these constructs to
return with their usual error value and set <br>
$!.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Improved diagnostics <br>
Line numbers are no longer suppressed (under most likely
circumstances) during the global destruction phase.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Diagnostics emitted from code
running in threads other than the main thread are now
accompanied by the thread ID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Embedded null characters in
diagnostics now actually show up. They used to truncate the
message in prior versions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$foo::a and $foo::b are now
exempt from &quot;possible typo&quot; warnings only if
sort() is encountered in package &quot;foo&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unrecognized alphabetic escapes
encountered when parsing quote constructs now generate a
warning, since they may take on new semantics in later
versions of Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Many diagnostics now report the
internal operation in which the warning was provoked, like
so:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use of uninitialized value in
concatenation (.) at (eval 1) line 1. <br>
Use of uninitialized value in print at (eval 1) line 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Diagnostics that occur within
eval may also report the file and line number where the eval
is located, in addition to the eval sequence number and the
line number within the <br>
evaluated text itself. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Not enough arguments for scalar
at (eval 4)[newlib/perl5db.pl:1411] line 2, at EOF</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Diagnostics follow STDERR <br>
Diagnostic output now goes to whichever file the
&quot;STDERR&quot; handle is pointing at, instead of always
going to the underlying C runtime library&rsquo;s
&quot;stderr&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">More consistent close-on-exec
behavior <br>
On systems that support a close-on-exec flag on filehandles,
the flag is now set for any handles created by pipe(),
socketpair(), socket(), and accept(), if that is warranted
by <br>
the value of $^F that may be in effect. Earlier versions
neglected to set the flag for handles created with these
operators. See &quot;pipe&quot; in perlfunc,
&quot;socketpair&quot; in perlfunc, <br>
&quot;socket&quot; in perlfunc, &quot;accept&quot; in
perlfunc, and &quot;$^F&quot; in perlvar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">syswrite() ease-of-use <br>
The length argument of &quot;syswrite()&quot; has become
optional.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Better syntax checks on
parenthesized unary operators <br>
Expressions such as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print
defined(&amp;foo,&amp;bar,&amp;baz); <br>
print uc(&quot;foo&quot;,&quot;bar&quot;,&quot;baz&quot;);
<br>
undef($foo,&amp;bar);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">used to be accidentally allowed
in earlier versions, and produced unpredictable behaviour.
Some produced ancillary warnings when used in this way;
others silently did the wrong <br>
thing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The parenthesized forms of most
unary operators that expect a single argument now ensure
that they are not called with more than one argument, making
the cases shown above syntax <br>
errors. The usual behaviour of:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print defined &amp;foo,
&amp;bar, &amp;baz; <br>
print uc &quot;foo&quot;, &quot;bar&quot;, &quot;baz&quot;;
<br>
undef $foo, &amp;bar;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">remains unchanged. See
perlop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bit operators support full
native integer width <br>
The bit operators (&amp; | ^ ~ &lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;) now
operate on the full native integral width (the exact size of
which is available in $Config{ivsize}). For example, if your
platform is <br>
either natively 64-bit or if Perl has been configured to use
64-bit integers, these operations apply to 8 bytes (as
opposed to 4 bytes on 32-bit platforms). For portability, be
<br>
sure to mask off the excess bits in the result of unary
&quot;~&quot;, e.g., &quot;~$x &amp; 0xffffffff&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Improved security features <br>
More potentially unsafe operations taint their results for
improved security.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;passwd&quot; and
&quot;shell&quot; fields returned by the getpwent(),
getpwnam(), and getpwuid() are now tainted, because the user
can affect their own encrypted password and login shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The variable modified by
shmread(), and messages returned by msgrcv() (and its
object-oriented interface IPC::SysV::Msg::rcv) are also
tainted, because other untrusted processes <br>
can modify messages and shared memory segments for their own
nefarious purposes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">More functional bareword
prototype (*) <br>
Bareword prototypes have been rationalized to enable them to
be used to override builtins that accept barewords and
interpret them in a special way, such as &quot;require&quot;
or &quot;do&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Arguments prototyped as
&quot;*&quot; will now be visible within the subroutine as
either a simple scalar or as a reference to a typeglob. See
&quot;Prototypes&quot; in perlsub.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;require&quot; and
&quot;do&quot; may be overridden <br>
&quot;require&quot; and &quot;do &rsquo;file&rsquo;&quot;
operations may be overridden locally by importing
subroutines of the same name into the current package (or
globally by importing them into the <br>
CORE::GLOBAL:: namespace). Overriding &quot;require&quot;
will also affect &quot;use&quot;, provided the override is
visible at compile-time. See &quot;Overriding Built-in
Functions&quot; in perlsub.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$^X variables may now have names
longer than one character <br>
Formerly, $^X was synonymous with ${&quot; compatibility
reasons, these variables must be written with explicit
braces, as &quot;${^XY}&quot; for example.
&quot;${^XYZ}&quot; is synonymous with ${&quot; control
character, such as &quot;${^XY^Z}&quot;, are illegal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The old syntax has not changed.
As before, &lsquo;^X&rsquo; may be either a literal
control-X character or the two-character sequence
&lsquo;caret&rsquo; plus &lsquo;X&rsquo;. When braces are
omitted, the <br>
variable name stops after the control character. Thus
&quot;$^XYZ&quot; continues to be synonymous with &quot;$^X
. &quot;YZ&quot;&quot; as before.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As before, lexical variables may
not have names beginning with control characters. As before,
variables whose names begin with a control character are
always forced to be in <br>
package &lsquo;main&rsquo;. All such variables are reserved
for future extensions, except those that begin with
&quot;^_&quot;, which may be used by user programs and are
guaranteed not to acquire <br>
special meaning in any future version of Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">New variable $^C reflects
&quot;-c&quot; switch <br>
$^C has a boolean value that reflects whether perl is being
run in compile-only mode (i.e. via the &quot;-c&quot;
switch). Since BEGIN blocks are executed under such
conditions, this <br>
variable enables perl code to determine whether actions that
make sense only during normal running are warranted. See
perlvar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">New variable $^V contains Perl
version as a string <br>
$^V contains the Perl version number as a string composed of
characters whose ordinals match the version numbers, i.e.
v5.6.0. This may be used in string comparisons.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See &quot;Support for strings
represented as a vector of ordinals&quot; for an
example.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Optional Y2K warnings <br>
If Perl is built with the cpp macro &quot;PERL_Y2KWARN&quot;
defined, it emits optional warnings when concatenating the
number 19 with another number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This behavior must be
specifically enabled when running Configure. See INSTALL and
README.Y2K.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Arrays now always interpolate
into double-quoted strings <br>
In double-quoted strings, arrays now interpolate, no matter
what. The behavior in earlier versions of perl 5 was that
arrays would interpolate into strings if the array had been
<br>
mentioned before the string was compiled, and otherwise Perl
would raise a fatal compile-time error. In versions 5.000
through 5.003, the error was</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Literal @example now requires
backslash</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In versions 5.004_01 through
5.6.0, the error was</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In string, @example now must be
written as @example</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The idea here was to get people
into the habit of writing &quot;fred@example.com&quot; when
they wanted a literal &quot;@&quot; sign, just as they have
always written &quot;Give me back my &quot; when <br>
they wanted a literal &quot;$&quot; sign.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Starting with 5.6.1, when Perl
now sees an &quot;@&quot; sign in a double-quoted string, it
always attempts to interpolate an array, regardless of
whether or not the array has been used or <br>
declared already. The fatal error has been downgraded to an
optional warning:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Possible unintended
interpolation of @example in string</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This warns you that
&quot;fred@example.com&quot; is going to turn into
&quot;fred.com&quot; if you don&rsquo;t backslash the
&quot;@&quot;. See http://perl.plover.com/at-error.html for
more details about the <br>
history here.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@- and @+ provide
starting/ending offsets of regex matches <br>
The new magic variables @- and @+ provide the starting and
ending offsets, respectively, of $&amp;, $1, $2, etc. See
perlvar for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Modules and Pragmata <br>
Modules <br>
attributes <br>
While used internally by Perl as a pragma, this module also
provides a way to fetch subroutine and variable attributes.
See attributes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">B The Perl Compiler suite has
been extensively reworked for this release. More of the
standard Perl test suite passes when run under the Compiler,
but there is still a <br>
significant way to go to achieve production quality compiled
executables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: The Compiler suite remains
highly experimental. The <br>
generated code may not be correct, even when it manages to
execute <br>
without errors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Benchmark <br>
Overall, Benchmark results exhibit lower average error and
better timing accuracy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can now run tests for n
seconds instead of guessing the right number of tests to
run: e.g., timethese(-5, ...) will run each code for at
least 5 CPU seconds. Zero as the <br>
&quot;number of repetitions&quot; means &quot;for at least 3
CPU seconds&quot;. The output format has also changed. For
example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use
Benchmark;$x=3;timethese(-5,{a=&gt;sub{$x*$x},b=&gt;sub{$x**2}})</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will now output something like
this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Benchmark: running a, b, each
for at least 5 CPU seconds... <br>
a: 5 wallclock secs ( 5.77 usr + 0.00 sys = 5.77 CPU) @
200551.91/s (n=1156516) <br>
b: 4 wallclock secs ( 5.00 usr + 0.02 sys = 5.02 CPU) @
159605.18/s (n=800686)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">New features: &quot;each for at
least N CPU seconds...&quot;, &quot;wallclock secs&quot;,
and the &quot;@ operations/CPU second
(n=operations)&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">timethese() now returns a
reference to a hash of Benchmark objects containing the test
results, keyed on the names of the tests.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">timethis() now returns the
iterations field in the Benchmark result object instead of
0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">timethese(), timethis(), and the
new cmpthese() (see below) can also take a format specifier
of &rsquo;none&rsquo; to suppress output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A new function countit() is just
like timeit() except that it takes a TIME instead of a
COUNT.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A new function cmpthese() prints
a chart comparing the results of each test returned from a
timethese() call. For each possible pair of tests, the
percentage speed <br>
difference (iters/sec or seconds/iter) is shown.</p>

Benchmark.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ByteLoader <br>
The ByteLoader is a dedicated extension to generate and run
Perl bytecode. See ByteLoader.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">constant <br>
References can now be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The new version also allows a
leading underscore in constant names, but disallows a double
leading underscore (as in &quot;__LINE__&quot;). Some other
names are disallowed or warned <br>
against, including BEGIN, END, etc. Some names which were
forced into main:: used to fail silently in some cases; now
they&rsquo;re fatal (outside of main::) and an optional <br>
warning (inside of main::). The ability to detect whether a
constant had been set with a given name has been added.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See constant.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">charnames <br>
This pragma implements the &quot;tring escape. See
charnames.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Data::Dumper <br>
A &quot;Maxdepth&quot; setting can be specified to avoid
venturing too deeply into deep data structures. See
Data::Dumper.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The XSUB implementation of
Dump() is now automatically called if the &quot;Useqq&quot;
setting is not in use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Dumping &quot;qr//&quot; objects
works correctly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DB &quot;DB&quot; is an
experimental module that exposes a clean abstraction to
Perl&rsquo;s debugging API.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DB_File <br>
DB_File can now be built with Berkeley DB versions 1, 2 or
3. See &quot;ext/DB_File/Changes&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Devel::DProf <br>
Devel::DProf, a Perl source code profiler has been added.
See Devel::DProf and dprofpp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Devel::Peek <br>
The Devel::Peek module provides access to the internal
representation of Perl variables and data. It is a data
debugging tool for the XS programmer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Dumpvalue <br>
The Dumpvalue module provides screen dumps of Perl data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DynaLoader <br>
DynaLoader now supports a dl_unload_file() function on
platforms that support unloading shared objects using
dlclose().</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl can also optionally arrange
to unload all extension shared objects loaded by Perl. To
enable this, build Perl with the Configure option <br>
&quot;-Accflags=-DDL_UNLOAD_ALL_AT_EXIT&quot;. (This maybe
useful if you are using Apache with mod_perl.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">English <br>
$PERL_VERSION now stands for $^V (a string value) rather
than for $] (a numeric value).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Env Env now supports accessing
environment variables like PATH as array variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fcntl <br>
More Fcntl constants added: F_SETLK64, F_SETLKW64,
O_LARGEFILE for large file (more than 4GB) access (NOTE: the
O_LARGEFILE is automatically added to sysopen() flags if
large <br>
file support has been configured, as is the default),
Free/Net/OpenBSD locking behaviour flags F_FLOCK, F_POSIX,
Linux F_SHLCK, and O_ACCMODE: the combined mask of O_RDONLY,
<br>
O_WRONLY, and O_RDWR. The seek()/sysseek() constants
SEEK_SET, SEEK_CUR, and SEEK_END are available via the
&quot;:seek&quot; tag. The chmod()/stat() S_IF* constants
and S_IS* <br>
functions are available via the &quot;:mode&quot; tag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File::Compare <br>
A compare_text() function has been added, which allows
custom comparison functions. See File::Compare.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File::Find <br>
File::Find now works correctly when the wanted() function is
either autoloaded or is a symbolic reference.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A bug that caused File::Find to
lose track of the working directory when pruning top-level
directories has been fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File::Find now also supports
several other options to control its behavior. It can follow
symbolic links if the &quot;follow&quot; option is
specified. Enabling the &quot;no_chdir&quot; option <br>
will make File::Find skip changing the current directory
when walking directories. The &quot;untaint&quot; flag can
be useful when running with taint checks enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See File::Find.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File::Glob <br>
This extension implements BSD-style file globbing. By
default, it will also be used for the internal
implementation of the glob() operator. See File::Glob.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File::Spec <br>
New methods have been added to the File::Spec module:
devnull() returns the name of the null device (/dev/null on
Unix) and tmpdir() the name of the temp directory (normally
<br>
/tmp on Unix). There are now also methods to convert between
absolute and relative filenames: abs2rel() and rel2abs().
For compatibility with operating systems that specify <br>
volume names in file paths, the splitpath(), splitdir(), and
catdir() methods have been added.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File::Spec::Functions <br>
The new File::Spec::Functions modules provides a function
interface to the File::Spec module. Allows shorthand</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$fullname = catfile($dir1,
$dir2, $file);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">instead of</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Getopt::Long <br>
Getopt::Long licensing has changed to allow the Perl
Artistic License as well as the GPL. It used to be GPL only,
which got in the way of non-GPL applications that wanted to

<p style="margin-top: 1em">=cut</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See Pod::Usage for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A bug that prevented the
non-option call-back &lt;&gt; from being specified as the
first argument has been fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To specify the characters &lt;
and &gt; as option starters, use &gt;&lt;. Note, however,
that changing option starters is strongly deprecated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IO write() and syswrite() will
now accept a single-argument form of the call, for
consistency with Perl&rsquo;s syswrite().</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can now create a TCP-based
IO::Socket::INET without forcing a connect attempt. This
allows you to configure its options (like making it
non-blocking) and then call <br>
connect() manually.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A bug that prevented the
IO::Socket::protocol() accessor from ever returning the
correct value has been corrected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IO::Socket::connect now uses
non-blocking IO instead of alarm() to do connect
timeouts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IO::Socket::accept now uses
select() instead of alarm() for doing timeouts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IO::Socket::INET-&gt;new now
sets $! correctly on failure. $@ is still set for backwards
compatibility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">JPL Java Perl Lingo is now
distributed with Perl. See jpl/README for more

now also act as mutators (accessor $z-&gt;Re(), mutator
$z-&gt;Re(3)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The class method
&quot;display_format&quot; and the corresponding object
method &quot;display_format&quot;, in addition to accepting
just one argument, now can also accept a parameter hash.
<br>
Recognized keys of a parameter hash are &quot;style&quot;,
which corresponds to the old one parameter case, and two new
parameters: &quot;format&quot;, which is a printf()-style
format string <br>
(defaults usually to &quot;%.15g&quot;, you can revert to
the default by setting the format string to
&quot;undef&quot;) used for both parts of a complex number,
and &quot;polar_pretty_print&quot; <br>
(defaults to true), which controls whether an attempt is
made to try to recognize small multiples and rationals of pi
(2pi, pi/2) at the argument (angle) of a polar complex <br>
number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The potentially disruptive
change is that in list context both methods now return the
parameter hash, instead of only the value of the
&quot;style&quot; parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Math::Trig <br>
A little bit of radial trigonometry (cylindrical and
spherical), radial coordinate conversions, and the great
circle distance were added.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pod::Parser, Pod::InputObjects
<br>
Pod::Parser is a base class for parsing and selecting
sections of pod documentation from an input stream. This
module takes care of identifying pod paragraphs and commands
<br>
in the input and hands off the parsed paragraphs and
commands to user-defined methods which are free to interpret
or translate them as they see fit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pod::InputObjects defines some
input objects needed by Pod::Parser, and for advanced users
of Pod::Parser that need more about a command besides its
name and text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As of release 5.6.0 of Perl,
Pod::Parser is now the officially sanctioned &quot;base
parser code&quot; recommended for use by all pod2xxx
translators. Pod::Text (pod2text) and <br>
Pod::Man (pod2man) have already been converted to use
Pod::Parser and efforts to convert Pod::HTML (pod2html) are
already underway. For any questions or comments about pod
<br>
parsing and translating issues and utilities, please use the
pod-people@perl.org mailing list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For further information, please
see Pod::Parser and Pod::InputObjects.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pod::Checker, podchecker <br>
This utility checks pod files for correct syntax, according
to perlpod. Obvious errors are flagged as such, while
warnings are printed for mistakes that can be handled <br>
gracefully. The checklist is not complete yet. See
Pod::Checker.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pod::ParseUtils, Pod::Find <br>
These modules provide a set of gizmos that are useful mainly
for pod translators. Pod::Find traverses directory
structures and returns found pod files, along with their
<br>
canonical names (like &quot;File::Spec::Unix&quot;).
Pod::ParseUtils contains Pod::List (useful for storing pod
list information), Pod::Hyperlink (for parsing the contents
of &quot;L&lt;&gt;&quot; <br>
sequences) and Pod::Cache (for caching information about pod
files, e.g., link nodes).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pod::Select, podselect <br>
Pod::Select is a subclass of Pod::Parser which provides a
function named &quot;podselect()&quot; to filter out
user-specified sections of raw pod documentation from an
input stream. <br>
podselect is a script that provides access to Pod::Select
from other scripts to be used as a filter. See
Pod::Select.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pod::Usage, pod2usage <br>
Pod::Usage provides the function &quot;pod2usage()&quot; to
print usage messages for a Perl script based on its embedded
pod documentation. The pod2usage() function is generally
<br>
useful to all script authors since it lets them write and
maintain a single source (the pods) for documentation, thus
removing the need to create and maintain redundant usage
<br>
message text consisting of information already in the
pods.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is also a pod2usage script
which can be used from other kinds of scripts to print usage
messages from pods (even for non-Perl scripts with pods
embedded in comments).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For details and examples, please
see Pod::Usage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pod::Text and Pod::Man <br>
Pod::Text has been rewritten to use Pod::Parser. While
pod2text() is still available for backwards compatibility,
the module now has a new preferred interface. See <br>
Pod::Text for the details. The new Pod::Text module is
easily subclassed for tweaks to the output, and two such
subclasses (Pod::Text::Termcap for man-page-style bold and
<br>
underlining using termcap information, and Pod::Text::Color
for markup with ANSI color sequences) are now standard.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pod2man has been turned into a
module, Pod::Man, which also uses Pod::Parser. In the
process, several outstanding bugs related to quotes in
section headers, quoting of code <br>
escapes, and nested lists have been fixed. pod2man is now a
wrapper script around this module.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SDBM_File <br>
An EXISTS method has been added to this module (and
sdbm_exists() has been added to the underlying sdbm
library), so one can now call exists on an SDBM_File tied
hash and get <br>
the correct result, rather than a runtime error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A bug that may have caused data
loss when more than one disk block happens to be read from
the database in a single FETCH() has been fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sys::Syslog <br>
Sys::Syslog now uses XSUBs to access facilities from
syslog.h so it no longer requires syslog.ph to exist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sys::Hostname <br>
Sys::Hostname now uses XSUBs to call the C library&rsquo;s
gethostname() or uname() if they exist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Term::ANSIColor <br>
Term::ANSIColor is a very simple module to provide easy and
readable access to the ANSI color and highlighting escape
sequences, supported by most ANSI terminal emulators. <br>
It is now included standard.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Time::Local <br>
The timelocal() and timegm() functions used to silently
return bogus results when the date fell outside the
machine&rsquo;s integer range. They now consistently croak()
if the <br>
date falls in an unsupported range.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Win32 <br>
The error return value in list context has been changed for
all functions that return a list of values. Previously these
functions returned a list with a single element <br>
&quot;undef&quot; if an error occurred. Now these functions
return the empty list in these situations. This applies to
the following functions:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Win32::FsType <br>
Win32::GetOSVersion</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The remaining functions are
unchanged and continue to return &quot;undef&quot; on error
even in list context.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Win32::SetLastError(ERROR)
function has been added as a complement to the
Win32::GetLastError() function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The new
Win32::GetFullPathName(FILENAME) returns the full absolute
pathname for FILENAME in scalar context. In list context it
returns a two-element list containing the <br>
fully qualified directory name and the filename. See
Win32.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">XSLoader <br>
The XSLoader extension is a simpler alternative to
DynaLoader. See XSLoader.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DBM Filters <br>
A new feature called &quot;DBM Filters&quot; has been added
to all the DBM modules--DB_File, GDBM_File, NDBM_File,
ODBM_File, and SDBM_File. DBM Filters add four new methods
to each <br>
DBM module:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">filter_store_key <br>
filter_store_value <br>
filter_fetch_key <br>
filter_fetch_value</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These can be used to filter
key-value pairs before the pairs are written to the database
or just after they are read from the database. See
perldbmfilter for further <br>
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pragmata <br>
&quot;use attrs&quot; is now obsolete, and is only provided
for backward-compatibility. It&rsquo;s been replaced by the
&quot;sub : attributes&quot; syntax. See &quot;Subroutine
Attributes&quot; in perlsub and <br>
attributes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Lexical warnings pragma,
&quot;use warnings;&quot;, to control optional warnings. See
perllexwarn.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;use filetest&quot; to
control the behaviour of filetests (&quot;-r&quot;
&quot;-w&quot; ...). Currently only one subpragma
implemented, &quot;use filetest &rsquo;access&rsquo;;&quot;,
that uses access(2) or equivalent to <br>
check permissions instead of using stat(2) as usual. This
matters in filesystems where there are ACLs (access control
lists): the stat(2) might lie, but access(2) knows
better.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;open&quot; pragma can
be used to specify default disciplines for handle
constructors (e.g. open()) and for qx//. The two
pseudo-disciplines &quot;:raw&quot; and &quot;:crlf&quot;
are currently <br>
supported on DOS-derivative platforms (i.e. where binmode is
not a no-op). See also &quot;binmode() can be used to set
:crlf and :raw modes&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Utility Changes <br>
dprofpp <br>
&quot;dprofpp&quot; is used to display profile data
generated using &quot;Devel::DProf&quot;. See dprofpp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">find2perl <br>
The &quot;find2perl&quot; utility now uses the enhanced
features of the File::Find module. The -depth and -follow
options are supported. Pod documentation is also included in
the script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">h2xs <br>
The &quot;h2xs&quot; tool can now work in conjunction with
&quot;C::Scan&quot; (available from CPAN) to automatically
parse real-life header files. The &quot;-M&quot;,
&quot;-a&quot;, &quot;-k&quot;, and &quot;-o&quot; options
are new.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perlcc <br>
&quot;perlcc&quot; now supports the C and Bytecode backends.
By default, it generates output from the simple C backend
rather than the optimized C backend.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Support for non-Unix platforms
has been improved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perldoc <br>
&quot;perldoc&quot; has been reworked to avoid possible
security holes. It will not by default let itself be run as
the superuser, but you may still use the -U switch to try to
make it <br>
drop privileges first.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Perl Debugger <br>
Many bug fixes and enhancements were added to perl5db.pl,
the Perl debugger. The help documentation was rearranged.
New commands include &quot;&lt; ?&quot;, &quot;&gt; ?&quot;,
and &quot;{ ?&quot; to list out <br>
current actions, &quot;man docpage&quot; to run your doc
viewer on some perl docset, and support for quoted options.
The help information was rearranged, and should be viewable
once again <br>
if you&rsquo;re using less as your pager. A serious security
hole was plugged--you should immediately remove all older
versions of the Perl debugger as installed in previous
releases, <br>
all the way back to perl3, from your system to avoid being
bitten by this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Improved Documentation <br>
Many of the platform-specific README files are now part of
the perl installation. See perl for the complete list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perlapi.pod <br>
The official list of public Perl API functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perlboot.pod <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perldebug.pod <br>
All material unrelated to running the Perl debugger, plus
all low-level guts-like details that risked crushing the
casual user of the debugger, have been relocated from the
<br>
old manpage to the next entry below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perldebguts.pod <br>
This new manpage contains excessively low-level material not
related to the Perl debugger, but slightly related to
debugging Perl itself. It also contains some arcane <br>
internal details of how the debugging process works that may
only be of interest to developers of Perl debuggers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perlfork.pod <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perlunicode.pod <br>
An introduction to Unicode support features in Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Performance enhancements <br>
Simple sort() using { $a &lt;=&gt; $b } and the like are
optimized <br>
Many common sort() operations using a simple inlined block
are now optimized for faster performance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Optimized assignments to lexical
variables <br>
Certain operations in the RHS of assignment statements have
been optimized to directly set the lexical variable on the
LHS, eliminating redundant copying overheads.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Faster subroutine calls <br>
Minor changes in how subroutine calls are handled internally
provide marginal improvements in performance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">delete(), each(), values() and
hash iteration are faster <br>
The hash values returned by delete(), each(), values() and
hashes in a list context are the actual values in the hash,
instead of copies. This results in significantly better <br>
performance, because it eliminates needless copying in most
situations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Installation and Configuration
Improvements <br>
-Dusethreads means something different <br>
The -Dusethreads flag now enables the experimental
interpreter-based thread support by default. To get the
flavor of experimental threads that was in 5.005 instead,
you need to <br>
run Configure with &quot;-Dusethreads
-Duse5005threads&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As of v5.6.0,
interpreter-threads support is still lacking a way to create
new threads from Perl (i.e., &quot;use Thread;&quot; will
not work with interpreter threads). &quot;use Thread;&quot;
<br>
continues to be available when you specify the
-Duse5005threads option to Configure, bugs and all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: Support for threads
continues to be an experimental feature. <br>
Interfaces and implementation are subject to sudden and
drastic changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">New Configure flags <br>
The following new flags may be enabled on the Configure
command line by running Configure with
&quot;-Dflag&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">usemultiplicity <br>
usethreads useithreads (new interpreter threads: no Perl API
yet) <br>
usethreads use5005threads (threads as they were in
5.005)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use64bitint (equal to now
deprecated &rsquo;use64bits&rsquo;) <br>
use64bitall</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">uselongdouble <br>
usemorebits <br>
uselargefiles <br>
usesocks (only SOCKS v5 supported)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Threadedness and 64-bitness now
more daring <br>
The Configure options enabling the use of threads and the
use of 64-bitness are now more daring in the sense that they
no more have an explicit list of operating systems of known
<br>
threads/64-bit capabilities. In other words: if your
operating system has the necessary APIs and datatypes, you
should be able just to go ahead and use them, for threads by
<br>
Configure -Dusethreads, and for 64 bits either explicitly by
Configure -Duse64bitint or implicitly if your system has
64-bit wide datatypes. See also &quot;64-bit
support&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Long Doubles <br>
Some platforms have &quot;long doubles&quot;, floating point
numbers of even larger range than ordinary
&quot;doubles&quot;. To enable using long doubles for
Perl&rsquo;s scalars, use -Duselongdouble.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Dusemorebits <br>
You can enable both -Duse64bitint and -Duselongdouble with
-Dusemorebits. See also &quot;64-bit support&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Duselargefiles <br>
Some platforms support system APIs that are capable of
handling large files (typically, files larger than two
gigabytes). Perl will try to use these APIs if you ask for
<br>
-Duselargefiles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See &quot;Large file
support&quot; for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">installusrbinperl <br>
You can use &quot;Configure -Uinstallusrbinperl&quot; which
causes installperl to skip installing perl also as
/usr/bin/perl. This is useful if you prefer not to modify
/usr/bin for some <br>
reason or another but harmful because many scripts assume to
find Perl in /usr/bin/perl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SOCKS support <br>
You can use &quot;Configure -Dusesocks&quot; which causes
Perl to probe for the SOCKS proxy protocol library (v5, not
v4). For more information on SOCKS, see:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">http://www.socks.nec.com/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;-A&quot; flag <br>
You can &quot;post-edit&quot; the Configure variables using
the Configure &quot;-A&quot; switch. The editing happens
immediately after the platform specific hints files have
been processed but <br>
before the actual configuration process starts. Run
&quot;Configure -h&quot; to find out the full &quot;-A&quot;
syntax.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enhanced Installation
Directories <br>
The installation structure has been enriched to improve the
support for maintaining multiple versions of perl, to
provide locations for vendor-supplied modules, scripts, and
<br>
manpages, and to ease maintenance of locally-added modules,
scripts, and manpages. See the section on Installation
Directories in the INSTALL file for complete details. For
<br>
most users building and installing from source, the defaults
should be fine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you previously used
&quot;Configure -Dsitelib&quot; or &quot;-Dsitearch&quot; to
set special values for library directories, you might wish
to consider using the new &quot;-Dsiteprefix&quot; setting
<br>
instead. Also, if you wish to re-use a config.sh file from
an earlier version of perl, you should be sure to check that
Configure makes sensible choices for the new directories.
<br>
See INSTALL for complete details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Platform specific changes <br>
Supported platforms <br>
&Acirc;&middot; The Mach CThreads (NEXTSTEP, OPENSTEP) are
now supported by the Thread extension.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; GNU/Hurd is now
supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Rhapsody/Darwin
is now supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; EPOC is now
supported (on Psion 5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The cygwin port
(formerly cygwin32) has been greatly improved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DOS <br>
&Acirc;&middot; Perl now works with djgpp 2.02 (and 2.03
alpha).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Environment
variable names are not converted to uppercase any more.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Incorrect exit
codes from backticks have been fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; This port
continues to use its own builtin globbing (not
File::Glob).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OS390 (OpenEdition MVS) <br>
Support for this EBCDIC platform has not been renewed in
this release. There are difficulties in reconciling
Perl&rsquo;s standardization on UTF-8 as its internal
representation for <br>
characters with the EBCDIC character set, because the two
are incompatible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is unclear whether future
versions will renew support for this platform, but the
possibility exists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VMS <br>
Numerous revisions and extensions to configuration, build,
testing, and installation process to accommodate core
changes and VMS-specific options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Expand %ENV-handling code to
allow runtime mapping to logical names, CLI symbols, and
CRTL environ array.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Extension of subprocess
invocation code to accept filespecs as command
&quot;verbs&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Add to Perl command line
processing the ability to use default file types and to
recognize Unix-style &quot;2&gt;&amp;1&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Expansion of File::Spec::VMS
routines, and integration into ExtUtils::MM_VMS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Extension of ExtUtils::MM_VMS to
handle complex extensions more flexibly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Barewords at start of
Unix-syntax paths may be treated as text rather than only as
logical names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Optional secure translation of
several logical names used internally by Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Miscellaneous bugfixing and
porting of new core code to VMS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Thanks are gladly extended to
the many people who have contributed VMS patches, testing,
and ideas.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Win32 <br>
Perl can now emulate fork() internally, using multiple
interpreters running in different concurrent threads. This
support must be enabled at build time. See perlfork for <br>
detailed information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When given a pathname that
consists only of a drivename, such as &quot;A:&quot;,
opendir() and stat() now use the current working directory
for the drive rather than the drive root.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The builtin XSUB functions in
the Win32:: namespace are documented. See Win32.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$^X now contains the full path
name of the running executable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A Win32::GetLongPathName()
function is provided to complement Win32::GetFullPathName()
and Win32::GetShortPathName(). See Win32.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">POSIX::uname() is supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">system(1,...) now returns true
process IDs rather than process handles. kill() accepts any
real process id, rather than strictly return values from
system(1,...).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For better compatibility with
Unix, &quot;kill(0, $pid)&quot; can now be used to test
whether a process exists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;Shell&quot; module is
supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Better support for building Perl
under command.com in Windows 95 has been added.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Scripts are read in binary mode
by default to allow ByteLoader (and the filter mechanism in
general) to work properly. For compatibility, the DATA
filehandle will be set to text <br>
mode if a carriage return is detected at the end of the line
containing the __END__ or __DATA__ token; if not, the DATA
filehandle will be left open in binary mode. Earlier <br>
versions always opened the DATA filehandle in text mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The glob() operator is
implemented via the &quot;File::Glob&quot; extension, which
supports glob syntax of the C shell. This increases the
flexibility of the glob() operator, but there <br>
may be compatibility issues for programs that relied on the
older globbing syntax. If you want to preserve compatibility
with the older syntax, you might want to run perl with <br>
&quot;-MFile::DosGlob&quot;. For details and compatibility
information, see File::Glob.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Significant bug fixes <br>
&lt;HANDLE&gt; on empty files <br>
With $/ set to &quot;undef&quot;, &quot;slurping&quot; an
empty file returns a string of zero length (instead of
&quot;undef&quot;, as it used to) the first time the HANDLE
is read after $/ is set to &quot;undef&quot;. <br>
Further reads yield &quot;undef&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This means that the following
will append &quot;foo&quot; to an empty file (it used to do
nothing):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perl -0777 -pi -e
&rsquo;s/^/foo/&rsquo; empty_file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The behaviour of:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perl -pi -e
&rsquo;s/^/foo/&rsquo; empty_file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">is unchanged (it continues to
leave the file empty).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;eval
&rsquo;...&rsquo;&quot; improvements <br>
Line numbers (as reflected by caller() and most diagnostics)
within &quot;eval &rsquo;...&rsquo;&quot; were often
incorrect where here documents were involved. This has been
corrected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Lexical lookups for variables
appearing in &quot;eval &rsquo;...&rsquo;&quot; within
functions that were themselves called within an &quot;eval

lexical search now correctly ends at the subroutine&rsquo;s
block boundary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The use of &quot;return&quot;
within &quot;eval {...}&quot; caused $@ not to be reset
correctly when no exception occurred within the eval. This
has been fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Parsing of here documents used
to be flawed when they appeared as the replacement
expression in &quot;eval &rsquo;s/.../.../e&rsquo;&quot;.
This has been fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All compilation errors are true
errors <br>
Some &quot;errors&quot; encountered at compile time were by
necessity generated as warnings followed by eventual
termination of the program. This enabled more such errors to
be reported <br>
in a single run, rather than causing a hard stop at the
first error that was encountered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The mechanism for reporting such
errors has been reimplemented to queue compile-time errors
and report them at the end of the compilation as true errors
rather than as warnings. <br>
This fixes cases where error messages leaked through in the
form of warnings when code was compiled at run time using
&quot;eval STRING&quot;, and also allows such errors to be
reliably <br>
trapped using &quot;eval &quot;...&quot;&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Implicitly closed filehandles
are safer <br>
Sometimes implicitly closed filehandles (as when they are
localized, and Perl automatically closes them on exiting the
scope) could inadvertently set $? or $!. This has been <br>
corrected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Behavior of list slices is more
consistent <br>
When taking a slice of a literal list (as opposed to a slice
of an array or hash), Perl used to return an empty list if
the result happened to be composed of all undef values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The new behavior is to produce
an empty list if (and only if) the original list was empty.
Consider the following example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@a =
(1,undef,undef,2)[2,1,2];</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The old behavior would have
resulted in @a having no elements. The new behavior ensures
it has three undefined elements.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note in particular that the
behavior of slices of the following cases remains
unchanged:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@a = ()[1,2]; <br>
@a = (getpwent)[7,0]; <br>
@a = (anything_returning_empty_list())[2,1,2]; <br>
@a = @b[2,1,2]; <br>
@a =
@c{&rsquo;a&rsquo;,&rsquo;b&rsquo;,&rsquo;c&rsquo;};</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See perldata.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;(&quot; prototype and
$foo{a} <br>
A scalar reference prototype now correctly allows a hash or
array element in that slot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;goto &amp;sub&quot; and
AUTOLOAD <br>
The &quot;goto &amp;sub&quot; construct works correctly when
&amp;sub happens to be autoloaded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;-bareword&quot; allowed
under &quot;use integer&quot; <br>
The autoquoting of barewords preceded by &quot;-&quot; did
not work in prior versions when the &quot;integer&quot;
pragma was enabled. This has been fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Failures in DESTROY() <br>
When code in a destructor threw an exception, it went
unnoticed in earlier versions of Perl, unless someone
happened to be looking in $@ just after the point the
destructor <br>
happened to run. Such failures are now visible as warnings
when warnings are enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Locale bugs fixed <br>
printf() and sprintf() previously reset the numeric locale
back to the default &quot;C&quot; locale. This has been
fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Numbers formatted according to
the local numeric locale (such as using a decimal comma
instead of a decimal dot) caused &quot;isn&rsquo;t
numeric&quot; warnings, even while the operations <br>
accessing those numbers produced correct results. These
warnings have been discontinued.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Memory leaks <br>
The &quot;eval &rsquo;return sub {...}&rsquo;&quot;
construct could sometimes leak memory. This has been
fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Operations that aren&rsquo;t
filehandle constructors used to leak memory when used on
invalid filehandles. This has been fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Constructs that modified @_
could fail to deallocate values in @_ and thus leak memory.
This has been corrected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Spurious subroutine stubs after
failed subroutine calls <br>
Perl could sometimes create empty subroutine stubs when a
subroutine was not found in the package. Such cases stopped
later method lookups from progressing into base packages.
<br>
This has been corrected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Taint failures under
&quot;-U&quot; <br>
When running in unsafe mode, taint violations could
sometimes cause silent failures. This has been fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">END blocks and the
&quot;-c&quot; switch <br>
Prior versions used to run BEGIN and END blocks when Perl
was run in compile-only mode. Since this is typically not
the expected behavior, END blocks are not executed anymore
<br>
when the &quot;-c&quot; switch is used, or if compilation
fails.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See &quot;Support for CHECK
blocks&quot; for how to run things when the compile phase
ends.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Potential to leak DATA
filehandles <br>
Using the &quot;__DATA__&quot; token creates an implicit
filehandle to the file that contains the token. It is the
program&rsquo;s responsibility to close it when it is done
reading from it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This caveat is now better
explained in the documentation. See perldata.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">New or Changed Diagnostics <br>
&quot;%s&quot; variable %s masks earlier declaration in same

See &quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/ must be followed by a*, A* or

counted are a*, A* or Z*. See &quot;pack&quot; in
perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/ must follow a numeric type

specification. See &quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/%s/: Unrecognized escape \%c

(W regexp) You used a backslash-character combination which
is not recognized by Perl. This combination appears in an
interpolated variable or a &quot;&rsquo;&quot;-delimited
regular <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/%s/: Unrecognized escape \%c in

(W regexp) You used a backslash-character combination which
is not recognized by Perl inside character classes. The
character was understood literally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/%s/ should probably be written
as &quot;%s&quot; <br>
(W syntax) You have used a pattern where Perl expected to
find a string, as in the first argument to &quot;join&quot;.
Perl will treat the true or false result of matching the
pattern <br>
against $_ as the string, which is probably not what you had
in mind.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%s() called too early to check
prototype <br>
(W prototype) You&rsquo;ve called a function that has a
prototype before the parser saw a definition or declaration
for it, and Perl could not check that the call conforms to
the <br>
prototype. You need to either add an early prototype
declaration for the subroutine in question, or move the
subroutine definition ahead of the call to get proper
prototype <br>
checking. Alternatively, if you are certain that
you&rsquo;re calling the function correctly, you may put an
ampersand before the name to avoid the warning. See
perlsub.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%s argument is not a HASH or

Perhaps you should use a mixed-case attribute name, instead.
See attributes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(in cleanup) %s <br>
(W misc) This prefix usually indicates that a DESTROY()
method raised the indicated exception. Since destructors are
usually called by the system at arbitrary points during <br>
execution, and often a vast number of times, the warning is
issued only once for any number of failures that would
otherwise result in the same message being repeated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Failure of user callbacks

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bad realloc() ignored <br>
(S) An internal routine called realloc() on something that

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bareword found in conditional
<br>
(W bareword) The compiler found a bareword where it expected
a conditional, which often indicates that an || or
&amp;&amp; was parsed as part of the last argument of the
previous <br>

(W portable) Using bit vector sizes larger than 32 is
non-portable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Buffer overflow in
prime_env_iter: %s <br>
(W internal) A warning peculiar to VMS. While Perl was
preparing to iterate over %ENV, it encountered a logical
name or symbol definition which was too long, so it was <br>
truncated to the string shown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t check filesystem of

(P) For some reason you can&rsquo;t check the filesystem of
the script for nosuid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t declare class for
non-scalar %s in &quot;%s&quot; <br>
(S) Currently, only scalar variables can declared with a
specific class qualifier in a &quot;my&quot; or

for other types of variables <br>
in future.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t declare %s in
&quot;%s&quot; <br>
(F) Only scalar, array, and hash variables may be declared
as &quot;my&quot; or &quot;our&quot; variables. They must
have ordinary identifiers as names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t ignore signal CHLD,
forcing to default <br>
(W signal) Perl has detected that it is being run with the
SIGCHLD signal (sometimes known as SIGCLD) disabled. Since
disabling this signal will interfere with proper <br>
determination of exit status of child processes, Perl has
reset the signal to its default value. This situation
typically indicates that the parent program under which Perl
<br>
may be running (e.g., cron) is being very careless.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t modify non-lvalue
subroutine call <br>
(F) Subroutines meant to be used in lvalue context should be
declared as such, see &quot;Lvalue subroutines&quot; in
perlsub.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t read CRTL environ
<br>
(S) A warning peculiar to VMS. Perl tried to read an element
of %ENV from the CRTL&rsquo;s internal environment array and
discovered the array was missing. You need to figure out
<br>
where your CRTL misplaced its environ or define
PERL_ENV_TABLES (see perlvms) so that environ is not
searched.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t remove %s: %s,
skipping file <br>
(S) You requested an inplace edit without creating a backup
file. Perl was unable to remove the original file to replace
it with the modified file. The file was left <br>
unmodified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t return %s from
lvalue subroutine <br>
(F) Perl detected an attempt to return illegal lvalues (such
as temporary or readonly values) from a subroutine used as
an lvalue. This is not allowed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t weaken a
nonreference <br>
(F) You attempted to weaken something that was not a
reference. Only references can be weakened.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Character class [:%s:] unknown
<br>
(F) The class in the character class [: :] syntax is
unknown. See perlre.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Character class syntax [%s]
belongs inside character classes <br>
(W unsafe) The character class constructs [: :], [= =], and
[. .] go inside character classes, the [] are part of the
construct, for example: /[012[:alpha:]345]/. Note that <br>
[= =] and [. .] are not currently implemented; they are
simply placeholders for future extensions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Constant is not %s reference
<br>
(F) A constant value (perhaps declared using the &quot;use
constant&quot; pragma) is being dereferenced, but it amounts
to the wrong type of reference. The message indicates the
type <br>
of reference that was expected. This usually indicates a
syntax error in dereferencing the constant value. See
&quot;Constant Functions&quot; in perlsub and constant.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">constant(%s): %s <br>
(F) The parser found inconsistencies either while attempting
to define an overloaded constant, or when trying to find the
character name specified in the &quot; escape. <br>
Perhaps you forgot to load the corresponding
&quot;overload&quot; or &quot;charnames&quot; pragma? See
charnames and overload.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CORE::%s is not a keyword <br>
(F) The CORE:: namespace is reserved for Perl keywords.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">defined(@array) is deprecated
<br>
(D) defined() is not usually useful on arrays because it
checks for an undefined scalar value. If you want to see if
the array is empty, just use &quot;if (@array) { # not empty
<br>
}&quot; for example.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">defined(%hash) is deprecated
<br>
(D) defined() is not usually useful on hashes because it
checks for an undefined scalar value. If you want to see if
the hash is empty, just use &quot;if (%hash) { # not empty

(W regexp) A character class range must start and end at a
literal character, not another character class like

your false range is <br>
interpreted as a literal &quot;-&quot;. Consider quoting the
&quot;-&quot;, &quot;&minus;&quot;. See perlre.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Filehandle %s opened only for
output <br>
(W io) You tried to read from a filehandle opened only for
writing. If you intended it to be a read/write filehandle,
you needed to open it with &quot;+&lt;&quot; or
&quot;+&gt;&quot; or &quot;+&gt;&gt;&quot; <br>
instead of with &quot;&lt;&quot; or nothing. If you intended
only to read from the file, use &quot;&lt;&quot;. See
&quot;open&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">flock() on closed filehandle %s
<br>
(W closed) The filehandle you&rsquo;re attempting to flock()
got itself closed some time before now. Check your logic
flow. flock() operates on filehandles. Are you attempting
<br>
to call flock() on a dirhandle by the same name?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Global symbol &quot;%s&quot;

(F) You&rsquo;ve said &quot;use strict vars&quot;, which
indicates that all variables must either be lexically scoped

to say which package the global variable is in (using
&quot;::&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hexadecimal number &gt;

(W portable) The hexadecimal number you specified is larger
than 2**32-1 (4294967295) and therefore non-portable between
systems. See perlport for more on portability <br>
concerns.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ill-formed CRTL environ value
&quot;%s&quot; <br>
(W internal) A warning peculiar to VMS. Perl tried to read
the CRTL&rsquo;s internal environ array, and encountered an
element without the &quot;=&quot; delimiter used to separate
keys from <br>
values. The element is ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ill-formed message in
prime_env_iter: |%s| <br>
(W internal) A warning peculiar to VMS. Perl tried to read a
logical name or CLI symbol definition when preparing to
iterate over %ENV, and didn&rsquo;t see the expected
delimiter <br>
between key and value, so the line was ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Illegal binary digit %s <br>
(F) You used a digit other than 0 or 1 in a binary
number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Illegal binary digit %s ignored
<br>
(W digit) You may have tried to use a digit other than 0 or
1 in a binary number. Interpretation of the binary number
stopped before the offending digit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Illegal number of bits in vec
<br>
(F) The number of bits in vec() (the third argument) must be
a power of two from 1 to 32 (or 64, if your platform
supports that).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Integer overflow in %s number
<br>
(W overflow) The hexadecimal, octal or binary number you
have specified either as a literal or as an argument to
hex() or oct() is too big for your architecture, and has
been <br>
converted to a floating point number. On a 32-bit
architecture the largest hexadecimal, octal or binary number
representable without overflow is 0xFFFFFFFF, 037777777777,
or <br>
0b11111111111111111111111111111111 respectively. Note that
Perl transparently promotes all numbers to a floating point
representation internally--subject to loss of <br>
precision errors in subsequent operations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Possible unintended
interpolation of %s in string <br>
(W ambiguous) It used to be that Perl would try to guess
whether you wanted an array interpolated or a literal @. It
no longer does this; arrays are now always interpolated <br>
into strings. This means that if you try something like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print
&quot;fred@example.com&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and the array @example
doesn&rsquo;t exist, Perl is going to print
&quot;fred.com&quot;, which is probably not what you wanted.
To get a literal &quot;@&quot; sign in a string, put a
backslash before <br>
it, just as you would to get a literal &quot;$&quot;
sign.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Possible Y2K bug: %s <br>

instead. For example, the way to match &quot;abc&quot;
provided that it is followed by three repetitions of

&quot;/abc(?=xyz){3}/&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">switching effective %s is not

This Perl can&rsquo;t set CRTL environ elements (%s=%s) <br>
(W internal) Warnings peculiar to VMS. You tried to change
or delete an element of the CRTL&rsquo;s internal environ
array, but your copy of Perl wasn&rsquo;t built with a CRTL
that <br>
contained the setenv() function. You&rsquo;ll need to
rebuild Perl with a CRTL that does, or redefine
PERL_ENV_TABLES (see perlvms) so that the environ array

the change to %ENV which produced the warning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Too late to run %s block <br>
(W void) A CHECK or INIT block is being defined during run
time proper, when the opportunity to run them has already
passed. Perhaps you are loading a file with
&quot;require&quot; or <br>
&quot;do&quot; when you should be using &quot;use&quot;

or &quot;do&quot; inside a BEGIN block.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unknown open() mode

(F) The second argument of 3-argument open() is not among

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unknown process %x sent message

(P) An error peculiar to VMS. Perl was reading values for
%ENV before iterating over it, and someone else stuck a

<br>
very confused, or perhaps trying to subvert Perl&rsquo;s
population of %ENV for nefarious purposes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unrecognized escape \%c passed

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unterminated attribute list <br>
(F) The lexer found something other than a simple identifier

attributes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unterminated attribute parameter

terminated the parameter list of the previous attribute too
soon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Value of CLI symbol
&quot;%s&quot; too long <br>
(W misc) A warning peculiar to VMS. Perl tried to read the
value of an %ENV element from a CLI symbol table, and found
a resultant string longer than 1024 characters. The <br>
return value has been truncated to 1024 characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Version number must be a

(P) The attempt to translate a &quot;use Module n.n

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Incompatible Changes <br>
Perl Source Incompatibilities <br>
Beware that any new warnings that have been added or old
ones that have been enhanced are not considered incompatible
changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since all new warnings must be
explicitly requested via the &quot;-w&quot; switch or the
&quot;warnings&quot; pragma, it is ultimately the
programmer&rsquo;s responsibility to ensure that warnings
are <br>
enabled judiciously.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CHECK is a new keyword <br>
All subroutine definitions named CHECK are now special. See
&quot;/&quot;Support for CHECK blocks&quot;&quot; for more
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Treatment of list slices of
undef has changed <br>
There is a potential incompatibility in the behavior of list
slices that are comprised entirely of undefined values. See
&quot;Behavior of list slices is more consistent&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Format of $English::PERL_VERSION
is different <br>
The English module now sets $PERL_VERSION to $^V (a string
value) rather than $] (a numeric value). This is a potential
incompatibility. Send us a report via perlbug if you <br>
are affected by this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See &quot;Improved Perl version
numbering system&quot; for the reasons for this change.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Literals of the form 1.2.3 parse
differently <br>
Previously, numeric literals with more than one dot in them
were interpreted as a floating point number concatenated
with one or more numbers. Such &quot;numbers&quot; are now
parsed <br>
as strings composed of the specified ordinals.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, &quot;print
97.98.99&quot; used to output 97.9899 in earlier versions,
but now prints &quot;abc&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See &quot;Support for strings
represented as a vector of ordinals&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Possibly changed pseudo-random
number generator <br>
Perl programs that depend on reproducing a specific set of
pseudo-random numbers may now produce different output due
to improvements made to the rand() builtin. You can use <br>
&quot;sh Configure -Drandfunc=rand&quot; to obtain the old
behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See &quot;Better pseudo-random
number generator&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hashing function for hash keys
has changed <br>
Even though Perl hashes are not order preserving, the
apparently random order encountered when iterating on the
contents of a hash is actually determined by the hashing
<br>
algorithm used. Improvements in the algorithm may yield a
random order that is different from that of previous
versions, especially when iterating on hashes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See &quot;Better worst-case
behavior of hashes&quot; for additional information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;undef&quot; fails on read
only values <br>
Using the &quot;undef&quot; operator on a readonly value
(such as $1) has the same effect as assigning
&quot;undef&quot; to the readonly value--it throws an
exception.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Close-on-exec bit may be set on
pipe and socket handles <br>
Pipe and socket handles are also now subject to the
close-on-exec behavior determined by the special variable
$^F.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See &quot;More consistent
close-on-exec behavior&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Writing &quot;$$1&quot; to mean
&quot;${$}1&quot; is unsupported <br>
Perl 5.004 deprecated the interpretation of $$1 and similar
within interpolated strings to mean &quot;$$ .
&quot;1&quot;&quot;, but still allowed it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In Perl 5.6.0 and later,
&quot;$$1&quot; always means &quot;${$1}&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">delete(), each(), values() and
&quot;)&quot; <br>
operate on aliases to values, not copies</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">delete(), each(), values() and
hashes (e.g. &quot;)&quot;) in a list context return the
actual values in the hash, instead of copies (as they used
to in earlier versions). Typical <br>
idioms for using these constructs copy the returned values,
but this can make a significant difference when creating
references to the returned values. Keys in the hash are <br>
still returned as copies when iterating on a hash.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See also &quot;delete(), each(),
values() and hash iteration are faster&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vec(EXPR,OFFSET,BITS) enforces
powers-of-two BITS <br>
vec() generates a run-time error if the BITS argument is not
a valid power-of-two integer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Text of some diagnostic output
has changed <br>
Most references to internal Perl operations in diagnostics
have been changed to be more descriptive. This may be an
issue for programs that may incorrectly rely on the exact
<br>
text of diagnostics for proper functioning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;%@&quot; has been removed
<br>
The undocumented special variable &quot;%@&quot; that used
to accumulate &quot;background&quot; errors (such as those
that happen in DESTROY()) has been removed, because it could
potentially <br>
result in memory leaks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Parenthesized not() behaves like
a list operator <br>
The &quot;not&quot; operator now falls under the &quot;if it
looks like a function, it behaves like a function&quot;
rule.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As a result, the parenthesized
form can be used with &quot;grep&quot; and &quot;map&quot;.
The following construct used to be a syntax error before,
but it works as expected now:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">grep not($_), @things;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On the other hand, using
&quot;not&quot; with a literal list slice may not work. The
following previously allowed construct:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print not (1,2,3)[0];</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">needs to be written with
additional parentheses now:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print not((1,2,3)[0]);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The behavior remains unaffected
when &quot;not&quot; is not followed by parentheses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Semantics of bareword prototype
&quot;(*)&quot; have changed <br>
The semantics of the bareword prototype &quot;*&quot; have
changed. Perl 5.005 always coerced simple scalar arguments
to a typeglob, which wasn&rsquo;t useful in situations where
the <br>
subroutine must distinguish between a simple scalar and a
typeglob. The new behavior is to not coerce bareword
arguments to a typeglob. The value will always be visible as
<br>
either a simple scalar or as a reference to a typeglob.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See &quot;More functional
bareword prototype (*)&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Semantics of bit operators may
have changed on 64-bit platforms <br>
If your platform is either natively 64-bit or if Perl has
been configured to used 64-bit integers, i.e.,
$Config{ivsize} is 8, there may be a potential
incompatibility in the <br>
behavior of bitwise numeric operators (&amp; | ^ ~ &lt;&lt;
&gt;&gt;). These operators used to strictly operate on the
lower 32 bits of integers in previous versions, but now
operate over <br>
the entire native integral width. In particular, note that
unary &quot;~&quot; will produce different results on
platforms that have different $Config{ivsize}. For
portability, be <br>
sure to mask off the excess bits in the result of unary
&quot;~&quot;, e.g., &quot;~$x &amp; 0xffffffff&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See &quot;Bit operators support
full native integer width&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">More builtins taint their
results <br>
As described in &quot;Improved security features&quot;,
there may be more sources of taint in a Perl program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To avoid these new tainting
behaviors, you can build Perl with the Configure option
&quot;-Accflags=-DINCOMPLETE_TAINTS&quot;. Beware that the
ensuing perl binary may be insecure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C Source Incompatibilities <br>
&quot;PERL_POLLUTE&quot; <br>
Release 5.005 grandfathered old global symbol names by
providing preprocessor macros for extension source
compatibility. As of release 5.6.0, these preprocessor
definitions <br>
are not available by default. You need to explicitly compile
perl with &quot;-DPERL_POLLUTE&quot; to get these
definitions. For extensions still using the old symbols,
this option <br>
can be specified via MakeMaker:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perl Makefile.PL POLLUTE=1</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;PERL_IMPLICIT_CONTEXT&quot;
<br>
This new build option provides a set of macros for all API
functions such that an implicit interpreter/thread context
argument is passed to every API function. As a result <br>
of this, something like &quot;sv_setsv(foo,bar)&quot;
amounts to a macro invocation that actually translates to
something like &quot;Perl_sv_setsv(my_perl,foo,bar)&quot;.
While this is <br>
generally expected to not have any significant source
compatibility issues, the difference between a macro and a
real function call will need to be considered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This means that there is a
source compatibility issue as a result of this if your
extensions attempt to use pointers to any of the Perl API
functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the above issue is not
relevant to the default build of Perl, whose interfaces
continue to match those of prior versions (but subject to
the other options described <br>
here).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See &quot;Background and
PERL_IMPLICIT_CONTEXT&quot; in perlguts for detailed
information on the ramifications of building Perl with this
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: PERL_IMPLICIT_CONTEXT is
automatically enabled whenever Perl is built <br>
with one of -Dusethreads, -Dusemultiplicity, or both. It is
not <br>
intended to be enabled by users at this time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;PERL_POLLUTE_MALLOC&quot;
<br>
Enabling Perl&rsquo;s malloc in release 5.005 and earlier
caused the namespace of the system&rsquo;s malloc family of
functions to be usurped by the Perl versions, since by
default they <br>
used the same names. Besides causing problems on platforms
that do not allow these functions to be cleanly replaced,
this also meant that the system versions could not be <br>
called in programs that used Perl&rsquo;s malloc. Previous
versions of Perl have allowed this behaviour to be
suppressed with the HIDEMYMALLOC and EMBEDMYMALLOC
preprocessor <br>
definitions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As of release 5.6.0,
Perl&rsquo;s malloc family of functions have default names
distinct from the system versions. You need to explicitly
compile perl with &quot;-DPERL_POLLUTE_MALLOC&quot; <br>
to get the older behaviour. HIDEMYMALLOC and EMBEDMYMALLOC
have no effect, since the behaviour they enabled is now the
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that these functions do not
constitute Perl&rsquo;s memory allocation API. See
&quot;Memory Allocation&quot; in perlguts for further
information about that.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Compatible C Source API Changes
<br>
&quot;PATCHLEVEL&quot; is now &quot;PERL_VERSION&quot; <br>
The cpp macros &quot;PERL_REVISION&quot;,
&quot;PERL_VERSION&quot;, and &quot;PERL_SUBVERSION&quot;
are now available by default from perl.h, and reflect the
base revision, patchlevel, and subversion <br>
respectively. &quot;PERL_REVISION&quot; had no prior
equivalent, while &quot;PERL_VERSION&quot; and
&quot;PERL_SUBVERSION&quot; were previously available as
&quot;PATCHLEVEL&quot; and &quot;SUBVERSION&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The new names cause less
pollution of the cpp namespace and reflect what the numbers
have come to stand for in common practice. For
compatibility, the old names are still <br>
supported when patchlevel.h is explicitly included (as
required before), so there is no source incompatibility from
the change.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Binary Incompatibilities <br>
In general, the default build of this release is expected to
be binary compatible for extensions built with the 5.005
release or its maintenance versions. However, specific <br>
platforms may have broken binary compatibility due to
changes in the defaults used in hints files. Therefore,
please be sure to always check the platform-specific README
files <br>
for any notes to the contrary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The usethreads or
usemultiplicity builds are not binary compatible with the
corresponding builds in 5.005.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On platforms that require an
explicit list of exports (AIX, OS/2 and Windows, among
others), purely internal symbols such as parser functions
and the run time opcodes are not <br>
exported by default. Perl 5.005 used to export all functions
irrespective of whether they were considered part of the
public API or not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For the full list of public API
functions, see perlapi.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Known Problems <br>
Thread test failures <br>
The subtests 19 and 20 of lib/thr5005.t test are known to
fail due to fundamental problems in the 5.005 threading
implementation. These are not new failures--Perl 5.005_0x
has <br>
the same bugs, but didn&rsquo;t have these tests.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EBCDIC platforms not supported
<br>
In earlier releases of Perl, EBCDIC environments like OS390
(also known as Open Edition MVS) and VM-ESA were supported.
Due to changes required by the UTF-8 (Unicode) support, <br>
the EBCDIC platforms are not supported in Perl 5.6.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In 64-bit HP-UX the
lib/io_multihomed test may hang <br>
The lib/io_multihomed test may hang in HP-UX if Perl has
been configured to be 64-bit. Because other 64-bit platforms
do not hang in this test, HP-UX is suspect. All other <br>
tests pass in 64-bit HP-UX. The test attempts to create and
connect to &quot;multihomed&quot; sockets (sockets which
have multiple IP addresses).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NEXTSTEP 3.3 POSIX test failure
<br>
In NEXTSTEP 3.3p2 the implementation of the strftime(3) in
the operating system libraries is buggy: the %j format
numbers the days of a month starting from zero, which, while
<br>
being logical to programmers, will cause the subtests 19 to
27 of the lib/posix test may fail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tru64 (aka Digital UNIX, aka DEC
OSF/1) lib/sdbm test failure with gcc <br>
If compiled with gcc 2.95 the lib/sdbm test will fail (dump
core). The cure is to use the vendor cc, it comes with the
operating system and produces good code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UNICOS/mk CC failures during
Configure run <br>
In UNICOS/mk the following errors may appear during the
Configure run:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Guessing which symbols your C
compiler and preprocessor define... <br>
CC-20 cc: ERROR File = try.c, Line = 3 <br>

79bad switch yylook 79#ifdef A29K <br>
... <br>
4 errors detected in the compilation of
&quot;try.c&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The culprit is the broken awk of
UNICOS/mk. The effect is fortunately rather mild: Perl
itself is not adversely affected by the error, only the h2ph
utility coming with Perl, <br>
and that is rather rarely needed these days.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Arrow operator and arrays <br>
When the left argument to the arrow operator
&quot;-&gt;&quot; is an array, or the &quot;scalar&quot;
operator operating on an array, the result of the operation
must be considered erroneous. For <br>
example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@x-&gt;[2] <br>
scalar(@x)-&gt;[2]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These expressions will get
run-time errors in some future release of Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Experimental features <br>
As discussed above, many features are still experimental.
Interfaces and implementation of these features are subject
to change, and in extreme cases, even subject to removal in
<br>
some future release of Perl. These features include the
following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Threads <br>
Unicode <br>
64-bit support <br>
Lvalue subroutines <br>
Weak references <br>
The pseudo-hash data type <br>
The Compiler suite <br>
Internal implementation of file globbing <br>
The DB module <br>
The regular expression code constructs: <br>
&quot;(?{ code })&quot; and &quot;(??{ code })&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Obsolete Diagnostics <br>
Character class syntax [: :] is reserved for future
extensions <br>
(W) Within regular expression character classes ([]) the
syntax beginning with &quot;[:&quot; and ending with
&quot;:]&quot; is reserved for future extensions. If you
need to represent those <br>
character sequences inside a regular expression character
class, just quote the square brackets with the backslash:
&quot; <br>
Ill-formed logical name |%s| in prime_env_iter <br>
(W) A warning peculiar to VMS. A logical name was
encountered when preparing to iterate over %ENV which
violates the syntactic rules governing logical names.
Because it <br>
cannot be translated normally, it is skipped, and will not
appear in %ENV. This may be a benign occurrence, as some
software packages might directly modify logical name <br>
tables and introduce nonstandard names, or it may indicate
that a logical name table has been corrupted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In string, @%s now must be
written as @%s <br>
The description of this error used to say:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(Someday it will simply assume
that an unbackslashed @ <br>
interpolates an array.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">That day has come, and this
fatal error has been removed. It has been replaced by a
non-fatal warning instead. See &quot;Arrays now always
interpolate into double-quoted <br>
strings&quot; for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Probable precedence problem on
%s <br>
(W) The compiler found a bareword where it expected a
conditional, which often indicates that an || or &amp;&amp;
was parsed as part of the last argument of the previous
construct, <br>
for example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">open FOO || die;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">regexp too big <br>
(F) The current implementation of regular expressions uses
shorts as address offsets within a string. Unfortunately
this means that if the regular expression compiles to <br>
longer than 32767, it&rsquo;ll blow up. Usually when you
want a regular expression this big, there is a better way to
do it with multiple statements. See perlre.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use of
&quot;$$&lt;digit&gt;&quot; to mean
&quot;${$}&lt;digit&gt;&quot; is deprecated <br>
(D) Perl versions before 5.004 misinterpreted any type
marker followed by &quot;$&quot; and a digit. For example,
&quot;$$0&quot; was incorrectly taken to mean
&quot;${$}0&quot; instead of &quot;${$0}&quot;. This <br>
bug is (mostly) fixed in Perl 5.004.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, the developers of Perl
5.004 could not fix this bug completely, because at least
two widely-used modules depend on the old meaning of
&quot;$$0&quot; in a string. So Perl <br>
5.004 still interprets &quot;$$&lt;digit&gt;&quot; in the
old (broken) way inside strings; but it generates this
message as a warning. And in Perl 5.005, this special
treatment will cease.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Reporting Bugs <br>
If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the
articles recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc
newsgroup. There may also be information at <br>
http://www.perl.com/perl/ , the Perl Home Page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you believe you have an
unreported bug, please run the perlbug program included with
your release. Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case. Your bug <br>
report, along with the output of &quot;perl -V&quot;, will
be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl
porting team.</p>
