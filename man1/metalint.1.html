metalint - a metaconfig unit consistency checker
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<b>metalint</b> [ - <b>hklsV</b> ] [ - <b>L </b><i>dir</i> ]
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<i>Metalint</i> parses the units and performs some extensive consistency checks,
  to make sure the whole set is sound. Due to the relatively huge amount of
  units available, it is becoming very difficult to maintain the units manually,
  and an automated process can be of real help, although not perfect.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Metalint</i> operates from within your top level package directory and is
  used to make sure your own private units are correctly relying on the publicly
  available units. If you intensively develop new units, you should run
  <i>metalint</i> on them before making them publicly available.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
<i>Metalint</i> recognizes the following set of options:
<dl class="Bl-tag">

  <dd class="It-tag">(not implemented yet) By default, <i>metalint</i> only
