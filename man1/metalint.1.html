<p>METALINT(1) General Commands Manual METALINT(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
metalint - a metaconfig unit consistency checker</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
metalint [ -hklsV ] [ -L dir ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Metalint parses the units and performs some extensive
consistency checks, to make sure the whole set is sound. Due
to the relatively huge amount of units available, it is
becom&acirc; <br>
ing very difficult to maintain the units manually, and an
automated process can be of real help, although not
perfect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Metalint operates from within
your top level package directory and is used to make sure
your own private units are correctly relying on the publicly
available units. If you <br>
intensively develop new units, you should run metalint on
them before making them publicly available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Metalint recognizes the following set of options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Print a short usage
description and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k Keep temporary .MT
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l (not implemented yet) By
default, metalint only reports problems related to your own
private units. This switch directs metalint to also report
problems in pub&acirc; <br>
licly available units.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Silent mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L dir Override default library
location. Normally only useful for metaconfig maintainers to
locally check the units being developed instead of the
publicly available <br>
ones. The dir specified is the one containing the units U
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Print version number and
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
The following diagnostics may be emitted by metalint:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;(?MAKE) ignoring duplicate
dependency listing line.&quot; <br>
More than one ?MAKE: line bearing dependencies was found in
the unit. There may be only one such line, although multiple
?MAKE action lines may occur.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;(?MAKE) special unit
&rsquo;Xxx&rsquo; should not be listed as made.&quot; <br>
A special unit symbol (first letter capitalized) may only be
listed as made in the special unit itself. To suppress this
warning in legitimate cases, add a &rsquo;+&rsquo; in front
of <br>
the offending symbol (note that for non-special units, the
&rsquo;+&rsquo; in this position indicates an internal
symbol which should not appear in the config.sh file).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;(?MAKE) &rsquo;+xxx&rsquo;
is listed x times.&quot; <br>
A conditional dependency is listed more than once. This is
harmless though.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;(?MAKE) &rsquo;xxx&rsquo;
is listed x times.&quot; <br>
A normal depdendency is listed more than once. Again, an
harmless error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;(?MAKE) &rsquo;xxx&rsquo;
listed as both conditional and full dependency.&quot; <br>
Symbol is listed as a normal dependency and as a conditional
one. Metaconfig will consider this as being a full
dependency, but that may not be what you initially
wanted...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;(?Y) unknown layout
directive &rsquo;xxx&rsquo;.&quot; <br>
Layout directives may only be one of top, default or bottom,
but case does not matter. An unknown directive is just
ignored and handled as if default had been specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;(?S) duplicate description
for variable &rsquo;$xxx&rsquo;.&quot; <br>
Shell symbol is described more than once, and that will
produce two entries in the Glossary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;(?S) variable
&rsquo;$xxx&rsquo; is not listed on ?MAKE: line.&quot; <br>
The unit describes a shell symbol entry which cannot be used
externally since not listed as a dependency.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;(?S) syntax error in ?S:
construct.&quot; <br>
Self explainatory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;(?C) duplicate description
for symbol &rsquo;XXX&rsquo;.&quot; <br>
C symbol is described more than once, and that will produce
two entries for it in the Glossary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;(?C) syntax error in ?C:
construct.&quot; <br>
Self explainatory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;(?H) symbol
&rsquo;XXX&rsquo; was already defined.&quot; <br>
Apparently, two ?H: lines are defining the same C
symbol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;(?H) variable
&rsquo;$xxx&rsquo; not even listed on ?MAKE: line.&quot;
<br>
A variable is used, but not listed on the dependency
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;(?H) section was already
terminated by &rsquo;?H:.&rsquo;.&quot; <br>
There can be no more ?H: lines after the first
&rsquo;?H:.&rsquo; marking the end of that section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;(?H) uncommon cpp line
should be protected with &rsquo;?%&lt;:&rsquo;.&quot; <br>
All ?H: lines that are recognized by metaconfig and thus
metalint have their inclusion in config.h automatically
protected by a suitable symbol if none is provided.
How&acirc; <br>
ever, unrecognized lines must be protected with the
&rsquo;?%&lt;:&rsquo; sequence to avoid their inclusion
should the unit not be loaded in Configure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;(?H) line should not be
listed here but in &rsquo;?C:&rsquo;.&quot; <br>
Only cpp lines should appear in the ?H: section. If you have
a comment to put regarding the symbol, use ?C:. If you want
to comment a particular generation sequence, put <br>
them into ?X: comment so that they don&rsquo;t make it into
config.h.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;(?H) constraint
&rsquo;xxx&rsquo; is an unknown symbol.&quot; <br>
All the leading ?sym: constraints on the ?H: lines should be
a valid shell or C symbol, defined in the unit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;(?M) syntax error in ?M:
construct.&quot; <br>
Self explainatory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;(?M) symbol
&rsquo;xxx&rsquo; already listed on a ?M: line in
&rsquo;yyy&rsquo;.&quot; <br>
A magic definition for symbol xxx is attempted, but another
one was already provided in unit yyy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;(?V) visible declaration
in non-special unit ignored.&quot; <br>
Visible declarations (?V: lines) may only appear in special
units. Otherwise, they are meaningless.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;(?V) wanted variable
&rsquo;$xxx&rsquo; made visible.&quot; <br>
A wanted variable (described as a dependency on the ?MAKE:
line) cannot be made visible since that does not make any
sense: the unit cannot depend on it and then advertise <br>
it as being locally defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;(?V) defined variable
&rsquo;$xxx&rsquo; made visible.&quot; <br>
A defined variable (listed as made on the ?MAKE: line)
cannot be made visible, since it could as well be directly
wanted in another unit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;(?V) variable
&rsquo;$xxx&rsquo; already made visible by unit yyy.&quot;
<br>
Inconsistent declaration: two units are making one single
symbol visible...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;(?V) variable
&rsquo;$xxx&rsquo; already read-write visible in yyy.&quot;
<br>
The variable was already made visible as read-write by
another unit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;(?V) variable
&rsquo;$xxx&rsquo; already read-only visible in yyy.&quot;
<br>
The variable was already made visible as read-only by
another unit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;(?W) variable
&rsquo;$xxx&rsquo; already wanted.&quot; <br>
Variable is already wanted, there is no need to explicitly
ask for it here.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;(?W) variable
&rsquo;$xxx&rsquo; also locally defined.&quot; <br>
A wanted variable would conflict with a locally defined
variable and could result in getting a garbage value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;(?W) variable
&rsquo;$xxx&rsquo; already listed on a ?W: line in
&rsquo;yyy&rsquo;.&quot; <br>
The variable in the shell symbol section of a ?W: line can
only appear in one unit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;(?F) produced file
&rsquo;xxx&rsquo; mutiply declared.&quot; <br>
The file is listed more than once on the ?F: line, under the
same name. This does not appear when declaring both a
private UU file and a public file with the same name, for
<br>
instance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;(?F) UU file in
non-special unit ignored.&quot; <br>
Private UU files (i.e. files like the myread script created
for later perusal by Configure) may only be created in
special units. Exceptions allowed if the ?F: line is
pre&acirc; <br>
ceded by a proper ?LINT: hint.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;(?T) temporary symbol
&rsquo;$xxx&rsquo; multiply declared.&quot; <br>
Self explainatory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;directive should come
after ?MAKE declarations.&quot; <br>
The directive listed between () at the beginning of this
message should really come after the ?MAKE: lines. You must
reorder the unit or metalint will not be able to prop&acirc;
<br>
erly diagnose problems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;control sequence
&rsquo;?XXX:&rsquo; ignored within body.&quot; <br>
Attempt to use a control line other than ?X: or ?LINT: in
the unit body, which should be only shell code</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;variable
&rsquo;$xxx&rsquo; is changed.&quot; <br>
A variable listed as wanted in the dependency line is
changed. Such a variable should be read-only for the unit.
Use the change lint hint to suppress this message in
patho&acirc; <br>
logical cases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;no ?MAKE: line describing
dependencies.&quot; <br>
Every unit should have a dependency line, or it will be
silently ignored by metaconfig. This message is suppressed
by a ?LINT: empty hint.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;first body line should be
a general &rsquo;: description&rsquo;.&quot; <br>
The very first shell line of the unit that will be added to
the generated Configure script should hold a description of
the unit&rsquo;s purpose, on a &rsquo;:&rsquo; line. There
must be a <br>
space after the &rsquo;:&rsquo;, since it is interpreted by
the shell, and the description should avoid meta-characters
like &rsquo;(&rsquo; or &rsquo;&gt;&rsquo; unless the whole
string is quoted. This message <br>
is suppressed by a ?LINT: nocomment hint.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;missing space after
&rsquo;:&rsquo; to make it a comment.&quot; <br>
A line starting by &rsquo;:&rsquo; is interpreted by the
shell but will be ignored. There must be a space after the
&rsquo;:&rsquo; though, or the shell will try to execute an
unknown command...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;found unquoted
meta-character &gt; on comment line.&quot; <br>
A line starting by &rsquo;:&rsquo; is interpreted by the
shell but will be ignored. This means that meaningful
meta-characters such as &rsquo;(&rsquo; or
&rsquo;&gt;&rsquo; must be quoted or escaped with a
lead&acirc; <br>
ing backslash.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;found dangling quote on
&rsquo;:&rsquo; comment line.&quot; <br>
An unclosed single or double quote was spotted on a
&rsquo;:&rsquo; comment line. Since those lines are
interpreted by the shell, albeit ignored, all quotes must
match perfectly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;not ending with a blank
line.&quot; <br>
Since all units are gathered together to form one big
script, it is recommended (hence enforced by metalint) that
every unit file end with an empty line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;last line not ending with
a new-line character.&quot; <br>
This is merely intended to users whose editor does not
always append a new-line at the end of text files. Should
not happen when you use vi.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;symbol &rsquo;$xxx&rsquo;
was not described.&quot; <br>
The shell symbol defined by this unit was not documented.
Use the describe lint hint to suppress this message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;C symbol &rsquo;XXX&rsquo;
was not described.&quot; <br>
The C symbol defined by this unit was not documented. Use
the known lint hint to suppress this message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;C symbol &rsquo;XXX&rsquo;
was not defined by any ?H: line.&quot; <br>
A C symbol was advertised by never defined, hence it cannot
appear in the config.h file and is therefore useless...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;variable
&rsquo;$xxx&rsquo; should have been set.&quot; <br>
A variable listed on the make line as made by the unit was
not set by the shell code body. Use the set lint hint to
suppress this message in pathological cases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;unused dependency variable
&rsquo;$xxx&rsquo;.&quot; <br>
Apparently no usage is made from a shell variable. Use the
change or use lint hints (depending on the situation) to
suppress this message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;unused conditional
variable &rsquo;$xxx&rsquo;. <br>
Apparently no usage is made from this conditional
dependency. The change or use lint hints can be used to
suppress this message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;unused temporary variable
&rsquo;$xxx&rsquo;.&quot; <br>
A variable declared as temporary in a ?T: line is not used.
The use lint hint will fool metalint into thinking
it&rsquo;s indeed used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;unknown control sequence
&rsquo;?XXX:&rsquo;.&quot; <br>
Attempt to use an unknown control sequence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;unknown LINT request
&rsquo;false&rsquo; ignored.&quot; <br>
An unknown ?LINT: tag was used. All such tags must be
spelled out in lowercase.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;symbol &rsquo;$xxx&rsquo;
has no default value.&quot; <br>
A symbol used as a conditional dependency in some unit has
no default value set by a ?D: line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;stale ?MAKE: dependency
&rsquo;xxx&rsquo;.&quot; <br>
Unit lists a symbol as a dependency, but that symbol is
otherwise unknown, i.e. never appears as made by any other
unit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;symbol &rsquo;$xxx&rsquo;
missing from ?MAKE.&quot; <br>
A symbol used or defined was not listed as a dependency in
the ?MAKE: line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;missing xxx from ?MAKE for
visible &rsquo;$yyy&rsquo;.&quot; <br>
A symbol defined as visible by a special unit is used, but
that special unit is not part of the dependency line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;stale ?M: dependency
&rsquo;xxx&rsquo;.&quot; <br>
Magic line lists a C symbol as a dependency but that symbol
is not known by any unit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;unknown symbol
&rsquo;$xxx&rsquo;.&quot; <br>
I have no idea about what this symbol is. If the variable is
externally define, this warning can be suppresed via a
proper ?LINT: extern.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;read-only symbol
&rsquo;$xxx&rsquo; is set.&quot; <br>
A symbol that should be read-only is set by the unit&rsquo;s
shell code body.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;obsolete symbol
&rsquo;xxx&rsquo; is used.&quot; <br>
An obsolete symbol is used in the unit&rsquo;s shell
code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;undeclared symbol
&rsquo;$xxx&rsquo; is set.&quot; <br>
The unit tries to set a shell variable which has not been
otherwise declared as made or as a temporary variable, or
whatever.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;unclosed ?H:
section.&quot; <br>
The ?H: section was not terminated by a single
&rsquo;?H:.&rsquo; line before the body of the unit or the
start of another ?C: section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;C symbol &rsquo;xxx&rsquo;
is defined in the following units:&quot; <br>
The C symbol is defined in more that one unit. Offending
units are listed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;Shell symbol
&rsquo;xxx&rsquo; is defined in the following units:&quot;
<br>
A shell symbol is defined in more than one unit. Offending
units folllow.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;Shell symbol
&rsquo;xxx&rsquo; is altogether:&quot; <br>
A shell symbol is defined by some units, obsoleted by others
and used as a temporary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;Shell symbol
&rsquo;xxx&rsquo; is both defined and obsoleted:&quot; <br>
Self explainatory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;Shell symbol
&rsquo;xxx&rsquo; is both defined and used as
temporary:&quot; <br>
Self explainatory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;Shell symbol
&rsquo;xxx&rsquo; obsoleted also used as temporary:&quot;
<br>
Self explainatory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;definition of
&rsquo;$xxx&rsquo; not closed by &rsquo;?S:.&rsquo;.&quot;
<br>
Self explainatory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;definition of
&rsquo;XXX&rsquo; not closed by &rsquo;?C:.&rsquo;.&quot;
<br>
Self explainatory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;magic definition of
&rsquo;xxx&rsquo; not closed by &rsquo;?M:.&rsquo;.&quot;
<br>
Self explainatory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;variable
&rsquo;$xxx&rsquo; is defined externally.&quot; <br>
A variable defined externally (i.e. in another unit) is
used, without proper dependency information. Use the extern
lint hint to suppress this message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;file &rsquo;xxx&rsquo; was
not created.&quot; <br>
A file listed as a private UU file is not created by the
special unit. Creation is detected by seing an explicit
shell redirection to the file, not by an implicit creation
<br>
(such as a C compilation would for instance). All special
units should create only shell scripts explicitly anyway so
this message cannot be suppressed via a lint hint.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;local file
&rsquo;xxx&rsquo; may override the one set by
&rsquo;unit.U&rsquo;.&quot; <br>
You are attempting to create a local file, but the special
unit creates one bearing the exact same name and should it
be loaded before within Configure, you would override <br>
that file. Change the name of your local file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;unused temporary file
&rsquo;xxx&rsquo;. <br>
The file was declared on the ?F: line but does not appear to
be used anywhere.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;mis-used temporary file
&rsquo;xxx&rsquo;. <br>
A local temporary file has been declared on the ?F: line and
is used in a way that may not be the proper one. Indeed, all
such local files should be called with an explicit <br>
relative path, to avoid PATH lookups which could get you
another file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;you might not always get
file &rsquo;xxx&rsquo; from &rsquo;unit.U&rsquo;.&quot; <br>
You seem to be calling the specified file, but not by using
an explicit relative pathname. Relying on the PATH to find
this file is not safe. To fix this problem, call your <br>
file using somthing like ./xxx.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;missing Unit from ?MAKE
for private file &rsquo;xxx&rsquo;.&quot; <br>
You are using a private UU file without listing the special
unit that produces it in your dependency line. Add the unit
to your dependency list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;unknown private file
&rsquo;xxx&rsquo;.&quot; <br>
The file does not appear on any ?F: line; however it
should.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;File &rsquo;xxx&rsquo; is
defined in the following units:&quot; <br>
The listed units cannot seem to agree on who is defining the
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;empty here-document name
discouraged.&quot; <br>
You should refrain from using empty names for here
documents, as metalint will not monitor those.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;unclosed here-document xxx
started line x.&quot; <br>
The opened here-document at line x was never closed in this
unit. This generally mean that when the unit is used, the
generated script will not work!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;spurious &rsquo;LINT
xxx&rsquo; directive.&quot; <br>
You have inserted a ?LINT: directive that is not used to
shut-up warnings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;Cycle found for:&quot;
<br>
There is a dependency cycle found for the symbols listed.
Only the symbols involved in the cycle are listed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;Cycle involves:&quot; <br>
An exerpt of the dependencies where the cycle was found is
listed. This may involve far more symbols than the previous
message, because metalint actually rescans the rules <br>
to emphasize the cycle and stops whenever it has found one,
i.e. it does not try to minimize it (the cycle is found
using another algorithm, which unfortunately cannot spit
<br>
it out but only say for sure there is one).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REFERENCE <br>
Metalint uses the following control lines, which are
otherwise ignored by metaconfig:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">?V:read-only symbols:read-write
symbols <br>
This line should be used only in special units. It lists all
the shell variable defined by the unit which should not be
used directly as dependencies by other units: they <br>
must include this special unit in their dependency list if
they make use of any of the symbols described here. Those
can be viewed as exported symbols which you inherit from
<br>
when depending from the unit. Symbols may be exported
read-only or read-write.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">?F:files created <br>
This line serves two purposes: it is a metalint hint, and
also a placeholder for future jmake use. It must list three
kind of files: the temporary one which are created for <br>
a test, the private UU ones created in the UU directory for
later perusal, and the public ones left in the root
directory of the package. Temporary files must be listed
with <br>
a preceding &rsquo;!&rsquo; character (meaning &quot;no!
they&rsquo;re not re-used later!&quot;), private UU files
should be preceded by a &rsquo;./&rsquo; (meaning: to use
them, say ./file, not just file), and <br>
public ones should be named as-is.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">?T:shell temporaries <br>
This line should list all the shell variables used as
temporaries within the unit&rsquo;s body. This line should
be kept accurate, and prevents you from writing a unit
defining a <br>
symbol which would be used as a scratch variable in another
unit...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">?LINT:keyword symbol_list <br>
Specifies a lint hint. The following keywords are
available:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">change shell variable ok to be
changed <br>

<br>
define shell variables listed are defined in this unit <br>
