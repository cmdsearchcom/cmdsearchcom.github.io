<p>PG_STANDBY(1) PostgreSQL 9.2.18 Documentation
PG_STANDBY(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pg_standby - supports the creation of a PostgreSQL warm
standby server</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pg_standby [option...] archivelocation nextwalfile
xlogfilepath [restartwalfile]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
pg_standby supports creation of a &acirc;warm standby&acirc;
database server. It is designed to be a production-ready
program, as well as a customizable template should you
require specific <br>
modifications.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pg_standby is designed to be a
waiting restore_command, which is needed to turn a standard
archive recovery into a warm standby operation. Other
configuration is required as <br>
well, all of which is described in the main server manual
(see Section 25.2, &acirc;Log-Shipping Standby
Servers&acirc;, in the documentation).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To configure a standby server to
use pg_standby, put this into its recovery.conf
configuration file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">restore_command =
&rsquo;pg_standby archiveDir %f %p %r&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where archiveDir is the
directory from which WAL segment files should be
restored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If restartwalfile is specified,
normally by using the %r macro, then all WAL files logically
preceding this file will be removed from archivelocation.
This minimizes the number <br>
of files that need to be retained, while preserving
crash-restart capability. Use of this parameter is
appropriate if the archivelocation is a transient staging
area for this <br>
particular standby server, but not when the archivelocation
is intended as a long-term WAL archive area.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pg_standby assumes that
archivelocation is a directory readable by the server-owning
user. If restartwalfile (or -k) is specified, the
archivelocation directory must be writable <br>
too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are two ways to fail over
to a &acirc;warm standby&acirc; database server when the
master server fails:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Smart Failover <br>
In smart failover, the server is brought up after applying
all WAL files available in the archive. This results in zero
data loss, even if the standby server has fallen <br>
behind, but if there is a lot of unapplied WAL it can be a
long time before the standby server becomes ready. To
trigger a smart failover, create a trigger file containing
<br>
the word smart, or just create it and leave it empty.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fast Failover <br>
In fast failover, the server is brought up immediately. Any
WAL files in the archive that have not yet been applied will
be ignored, and all transactions in those files are <br>
lost. To trigger a fast failover, create a trigger file and
write the word fast into it. pg_standby can also be
configured to execute a fast failover automatically if no
new <br>
WAL file appears within a defined interval.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
pg_standby accepts the following command-line arguments:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c <br>
Use cp or copy command to restore WAL files from archive.
This is the only supported behavior so this option is
useless.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d <br>
Print lots of debug logging output on stderr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k <br>
Remove files from archivelocation so that no more than this
many WAL files before the current one are kept in the
archive. Zero (the default) means not to remove any files
<br>
from archivelocation. This parameter will be silently
ignored if restartwalfile is specified, since that
specification method is more accurate in determining the
correct <br>
archive cut-off point. Use of this parameter is deprecated
as of PostgreSQL 8.3; it is safer and more efficient to
specify a restartwalfile parameter. A too small setting <br>
could result in removal of files that are still needed for a
restart of the standby server, while a too large setting
wastes archive space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r maxretries <br>
Set the maximum number of times to retry the copy command if
it fails (default 3). After each failure, we wait for
sleeptime * num_retries so that the wait time increases <br>
progressively. So by default, we will wait 5 secs, 10 secs,
then 15 secs before reporting the failure back to the
standby server. This will be interpreted as end of recovery
<br>
and the standby will come up fully as a result.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s sleeptime <br>
Set the number of seconds (up to 60, default 5) to sleep
between tests to see if the WAL file to be restored is
available in the archive yet. The default setting is not
<br>
necessarily recommended; consult Section 25.2,
&acirc;Log-Shipping Standby Servers&acirc;, in the
documentation for discussion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t triggerfile <br>
Specify a trigger file whose presence should cause failover.
It is recommended that you use a structured file name to
avoid confusion as to which server is being triggered <br>
when multiple servers exist on the same system; for example
/tmp/pgsql.trigger.5432.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
Print the pg_standby version and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w maxwaittime <br>
Set the maximum number of seconds to wait for the next WAL
file, after which a fast failover will be performed. A
setting of zero (the default) means wait forever. The <br>
default setting is not necessarily recommended; consult
Section 25.2, &acirc;Log-Shipping Standby Servers&acirc;, in
the documentation for discussion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-?, --help <br>
Show help about pg_standby command line arguments, and
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
pg_standby is designed to work with PostgreSQL 8.2 and
later.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PostgreSQL 8.3 provides the %r
macro, which is designed to let pg_standby know the last
file it needs to keep. With PostgreSQL 8.2, the -k option
must be used if archive cleanup <br>
is required. This option remains available in 8.3, but its
use is deprecated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PostgreSQL 8.4 provides the
recovery_end_command option. Without this option a leftover
trigger file can be hazardous.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pg_standby is written in C and
has an easy-to-modify source code, with specifically
designated sections to modify for your own needs</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
On Linux or Unix systems, you might use:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">archive_command = &rsquo;cp %p
.../archive/%f&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">restore_command =
&rsquo;pg_standby -d -s 2 -t /tmp/pgsql.trigger.5442
.../archive %f %p %r 2&gt;&gt;standby.log&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">recovery_end_command = &rsquo;rm
-f /tmp/pgsql.trigger.5442&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where the archive directory is
physically located on the standby server, so that the
archive_command is accessing it across NFS, but the files
are local to the standby (enabling <br>
use of ln). This will:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; produce
debugging output in standby.log</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; sleep for 2
seconds between checks for next WAL file availability</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; stop waiting
only when a trigger file called /tmp/pgsql.trigger.5442
appears, and perform failover according to its content</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; remove the
trigger file when recovery ends</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; remove
no-longer-needed files from the archive directory</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On Windows, you might use:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">archive_command = &rsquo;copy %p
...\archive\%f&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">restore_command =
&rsquo;pg_standby -d -s 5 -t C:gsql.trigger.5442 ...rchive
%f %p %r 2&gt;&gt;standby.log&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">recovery_end_command =
&rsquo;del C:gsql.trigger.5442&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that backslashes need to be
doubled in the archive_command, but not in the
restore_command or recovery_end_command. This will:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; use the copy
command to restore WAL files from archive</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; produce
debugging output in standby.log</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; sleep for 5
seconds between checks for next WAL file availability</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; stop waiting
only when a trigger file called C:gsql.trigger.5442 appears,
and perform failover according to its content</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; remove the
trigger file when recovery ends</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; remove
no-longer-needed files from the archive directory</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The copy command on Windows sets
the final file size before the file is completely copied,
which would ordinarily confuse pg_standby. Therefore
pg_standby waits sleeptime seconds <br>
once it sees the proper file size. GNUWin32&rsquo;s cp sets
the file size only after the file copy is complete.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since the Windows example uses
copy at both ends, either or both servers might be accessing
the archive directory across the network.</p>
