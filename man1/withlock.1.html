<p>WITHLOCK(1) WITHLOCK(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
withlock - locking wrapper script</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
withlock lockfile command [args...] <br>
withlock [-w &lt;seconds&gt;|--wait=seconds] [-q|--quiet]
[-v|--verbose] lockfile command [args...] <br>
withlock [-h|--help] <br>
withlock [--version]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
withlock(1) is a wrapper script to make sure that some
program isn&Acirc;&acute;t run more than once. It is ideal
to prevent periodic jobs spawned by cron(8) from stacking
up.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It uses locks that are valid
only while the wrapper is running, and thus will never
require additional cleanup, even after a system crash or
reboot. This makes the wrapper safe <br>
and easy to use, and better than implementing half-hearted
locking within scripts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The script can wait a defined
time for a lock to become &quot;free&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SECURITY <br>
Lockfiles, generally, MUST NOT be placed in a publicly
writable directory, because that would allow for a symlink
attack. For that reason, withlock(1) simply disallows
lockfiles <br>
in such locations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-v, --verbose <br>
Print debug messages to stderr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q, --quiet <br>
If lock can&Acirc;&acute;t be acquired immediately, silently
quit without error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Show program&Acirc;&acute;s version number and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Show command synopsis and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w seconds, --wait=seconds <br>
Wait for maximum seconds for the lock to be acquired.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Instead of your command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;command&gt;
[&lt;args&gt;...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">you simply use</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">withlock &lt;lockfile&gt;
&lt;command&gt; [&lt;args&gt;...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cron(8) jobs, especially long
running ones, are frequently run under withlock(1).
Here&Acirc;&acute;s an example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-*/10 * * * * root withlock
LOCK-serverstatus /usr/bin/log_server_status2 <br>
43 5,17 * * * mirror withlock LOCK-rsync-edu-isos rsync
-rlptoH --no-motd
rsync.opensuse-education.org::download/ISOs/
/srv/mirrors/opensuse-education/ISOs -hi</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY <br>
This wrapper was implemented because no comparable solution
was found even after looking around for a long time (and
suffering problems caused by missing or insufficient locking
<br>
for years). The only solution that comes close is
with-lock-ex.c, an implementation in C, which was written by
Ian Jackson and placed in the public domain by him.
with-lock-ex.c <br>
is traditionally available on Debian in a package named
chiark-utils-bin. Parts of withlock&Acirc;&acute;s locking
strategy and parts of the usage semantics were inspired from
that program. <br>
This implementation was chosen to be done in Python because
it&Acirc;&acute;s universally available, easy to adapt, and
doesn&Acirc;&acute;t require to be compiled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Then, somebody pointed out to me
that there&Acirc;&acute;s flock(1), a small tool written in
C that does the same. Indeed, I had apparently managed to
miss that tool during a decade&Acirc;&acute;s worth <br>
of Linux hacking (you discover something new every day,
don&Acirc;&acute;t you?). The functionality is mainly the
same indeed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, withlock(1) has some
advantages:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; withlock(1) ist
a little easier and logical to use than flock(1). The
semantics are more suited for sysadmins.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; withlock(1)
always cleans up it&Acirc;&acute;s lock files. flock(1)
always lets them lying around. I admit that I like the fact
that with withlock(1) I can always see by the presence of
<br>
the lock files which jobs are running.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; flock(1)
doesn&Acirc;&acute;t prevent using unsafe directories</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; withlock(1) is
easily extensible</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; it could be used
as a Python module (not implemented so far)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; flock(1)
doesn&Acirc;&acute;t exist on Solaris and OSX</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
withlock(1) has been tested on many platforms, including
Debian, Ubuntu, openSUSE, CentOS, Fedora, FreeBSD, OSX,
OpenCSW Solaris and is in production use since 2009. There
don&Acirc;&acute;t <br>
seem to be race conditions (the author tried very hard to
break it) but there are no guarantees.</p>

peter@poeml.de in 2009.</p>
