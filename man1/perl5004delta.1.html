<p>PERL5004DELTA(1) Perl Programmers Reference Guide
PERL5004DELTA(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
perl5004delta - what&rsquo;s new for perl5.004</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This document describes differences between the 5.003
release (as documented in Programming Perl, second
edition--the Camel Book) and this one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Supported Environments <br>
Perl5.004 builds out of the box on Unix, Plan 9, LynxOS,
VMS, OS/2, QNX, AmigaOS, and Windows NT. Perl runs on
Windows 95 as well, but it cannot be built there, for lack
of a <br>
reasonable command interpreter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Core Changes <br>
Most importantly, many bugs were fixed, including several
security problems. See the Changes file in the distribution
for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">List assignment to %ENV works
<br>
&quot;%ENV = ()&quot; and &quot;%ENV = @list&quot; now work
as expected (except on VMS where it generates a fatal
error).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Change to &quot;Can&rsquo;t
locate Foo.pm in @INC&quot; error <br>
The error &quot;Can&rsquo;t locate Foo.pm in @INC&quot; now
lists the contents of @INC for easier debugging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Compilation option: Binary
compatibility with 5.003 <br>
There is a new Configure question that asks if you want to
maintain binary compatibility with Perl 5.003. If you choose
binary compatibility, you do not have to recompile your <br>
extensions, but you might have symbol conflicts if you embed
Perl in another application, just as in the 5.003 release.
By default, binary compatibility is preserved at the <br>
expense of symbol table pollution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$PERL5OPT environment variable
<br>
You may now put Perl options in the $PERL5OPT environment
variable. Unless Perl is running with taint checks, it will
interpret this variable as if its contents had appeared on
<br>
a &quot;#!perl&quot; line at the beginning of your script,
except that hyphens are optional. PERL5OPT may only be used
to set the following switches: -[DIMUdmw].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Limitations on -M, -m, and -T
options <br>
The &quot;-M&quot; and &quot;-m&quot; options are no longer
allowed on the &quot;#!&quot; line of a script. If a script
needs a module, it should invoke it with the &quot;use&quot;
pragma.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -T option is also forbidden
on the &quot;#!&quot; line of a script, unless it was
present on the Perl command line. Due to the way
&quot;#!&quot; works, this usually means that -T must be in
<br>
the first argument. Thus:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#!/usr/bin/perl -T -w</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will probably work for an
executable script invoked as &quot;scriptname&quot;,
while:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#!/usr/bin/perl -w -T</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will probably fail under the
same conditions. (Non-Unix systems will probably not follow
this rule.) But &quot;perl scriptname&quot; is guaranteed to
fail, since then there is no chance <br>
of -T being found on the command line before it is found on
the &quot;#!&quot; line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">More precise warnings <br>
If you removed the -w option from your Perl 5.003 scripts
because it made Perl too verbose, we recommend that you try
putting it back when you upgrade to Perl 5.004. Each new
<br>
perl version tends to remove some undesirable warnings,
while adding new warnings that may catch bugs in your
scripts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Deprecated: Inherited
&quot;AUTOLOAD&quot; for non-methods <br>
Before Perl 5.004, &quot;AUTOLOAD&quot; functions were
looked up as methods (using the @ISA hierarchy), even when
the function to be autoloaded was called as a plain function
(e.g. <br>
&quot;Foo::bar()&quot;), not a method (e.g.
&quot;Foo-&gt;bar()&quot; or
&quot;$obj-&gt;bar()&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl 5.005 will use method
lookup only for methods&rsquo; &quot;AUTOLOAD&quot;s.
However, there is a significant base of existing code that
may be using the old behavior. So, as an interim <br>
step, Perl 5.004 issues an optional warning when a
non-method uses an inherited &quot;AUTOLOAD&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The simple rule is: Inheritance
will not work when autoloading non-methods. The simple fix
for old code is: In any module that used to depend on
inheriting &quot;AUTOLOAD&quot; for non- <br>
methods from a base class named &quot;BaseClass&quot;,
execute &quot;*AUTOLOAD = BaseClass::AUTOLOAD&quot; during
startup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Previously deprecated %OVERLOAD
is no longer usable <br>
Using %OVERLOAD to define overloading was deprecated in
5.003. Overloading is now defined using the overload pragma.
%OVERLOAD is still used internally but should not be used by
<br>
Perl scripts. See overload for more details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Subroutine arguments created
only when they&rsquo;re modified <br>
In Perl 5.004, nonexistent array and hash elements used as
subroutine parameters are brought into existence only if
they are actually assigned to (via @_).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Earlier versions of Perl vary in
their handling of such arguments. Perl versions 5.002 and
5.003 always brought them into existence. Perl versions
5.000 and 5.001 brought them <br>
into existence only if they were not the first argument
(which was almost certainly a bug). Earlier versions of Perl
never brought them into existence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, given this
code:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">undef @a; undef %a; <br>
sub show { print $_[0] }; <br>
sub change { $_[0]++ }; <br>
show($a[2]); <br>
change($a{b});</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After this code executes in Perl
5.004, $a{b} exists but $a[2] does not. In Perl 5.002 and
5.003, both $a{b} and $a[2] would have existed (but
$a[2]&rsquo;s value would have been <br>
undefined).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Group vector changeable with $)
<br>
The $) special variable has always (well, in Perl 5, at
least) reflected not only the current effective group, but
also the group list as returned by the
&quot;getgroups()&quot; C function <br>
(if there is one). However, until this release, there has
not been a way to call the &quot;setgroups()&quot; C
function from Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In Perl 5.004, assigning to $)
is exactly symmetrical with examining it: The first number
in its string value is used as the effective gid; if there
are any numbers after the <br>
first one, they are passed to the &quot;setgroups()&quot; C
function (if there is one).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fixed parsing of
$$&lt;digit&gt;, &amp;$&lt;digit&gt;, etc. <br>
Perl versions before 5.004 misinterpreted any type marker
followed by &quot;$&quot; and a digit. For example,
&quot;$$0&quot; was incorrectly taken to mean
&quot;${$}0&quot; instead of &quot;${$0}&quot;. This bug is
<br>
(mostly) fixed in Perl 5.004.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, the developers of Perl
5.004 could not fix this bug completely, because at least
two widely-used modules depend on the old meaning of
&quot;$$0&quot; in a string. So Perl 5.004 <br>
still interprets &quot;$$&lt;digit&gt;&quot; in the old
(broken) way inside strings; but it generates this message
as a warning. And in Perl 5.005, this special treatment will
cease.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fixed localization of
$&lt;digit&gt;, $&amp;, etc. <br>
Perl versions before 5.004 did not always properly localize
the regex-related special variables. Perl 5.004 does
localize them, as the documentation has always said it
should. <br>
This may result in $1, $2, etc. no longer being set where
existing programs use them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">No resetting of $. on implicit
close <br>
The documentation for Perl 5.0 has always stated that $. is
not reset when an already-open file handle is reopened with
no intervening call to &quot;close&quot;. Due to a bug, perl
<br>
versions 5.000 through 5.003 did reset $. under that
circumstance; Perl 5.004 does not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;wantarray&quot; may return
undef <br>
The &quot;wantarray&quot; operator returns true if a
subroutine is expected to return a list, and false
otherwise. In Perl 5.004, &quot;wantarray&quot; can also
return the undefined value if a <br>
subroutine&rsquo;s return value will not be used at all,
which allows subroutines to avoid a time-consuming
calculation of a return value if it isn&rsquo;t going to be
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;eval EXPR&quot; determines
value of EXPR in scalar context <br>
Perl (version 5) used to determine the value of EXPR
inconsistently, sometimes incorrectly using the surrounding
context for the determination. Now, the value of EXPR
(before <br>
being parsed by eval) is always determined in a scalar
context. Once parsed, it is executed as before, by providing
the context that the scope surrounding the eval provided.
<br>
This change makes the behavior Perl4 compatible, besides
fixing bugs resulting from the inconsistent behavior. This
program:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@a = qw(time now is time); <br>
print eval @a; <br>
print &rsquo;|&rsquo;, scalar eval @a;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">used to print something like
&quot;timenowis881399109|4&quot;, but now (and in perl4)
prints &quot;4|4&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Changes to tainting checks <br>
A bug in previous versions may have failed to detect some
insecure conditions when taint checks are turned on. (Taint
checks are used in setuid or setgid scripts, or when <br>
explicitly turned on with the &quot;-T&quot; invocation
option.) Although it&rsquo;s unlikely, this may cause a
previously-working script to now fail, which should be
construed as a blessing <br>
since that indicates a potentially-serious security hole was
just plugged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The new restrictions when
tainting include:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">No glob() or &lt;*&gt; <br>
These operators may spawn the C shell (csh), which cannot be
made safe. This restriction will be lifted in a future
version of Perl when globbing is implemented without the
<br>
use of an external program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">No spawning if tainted $CDPATH,
$ENV, $BASH_ENV <br>
These environment variables may alter the behavior of
spawned programs (especially shells) in ways that subvert
security. So now they are treated as dangerous, in the
manner <br>
of $IFS and $PATH.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">No spawning if tainted $TERM
doesn&rsquo;t look like a terminal name <br>
Some termcap libraries do unsafe things with $TERM. However,
it would be unnecessarily harsh to treat all $TERM values as
unsafe, since only shell metacharacters can cause <br>
trouble in $TERM. So a tainted $TERM is considered to be
safe if it contains only alphanumerics, underscores, dashes,
and colons, and unsafe if it contains other characters <br>
(including whitespace).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">New Opcode module and revised
Safe module <br>
A new Opcode module supports the creation, manipulation and
application of opcode masks. The revised Safe module has a
new API and is implemented using the new Opcode module. <br>
Please read the new Opcode and Safe documentation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Embedding improvements <br>
In older versions of Perl it was not possible to create more
than one Perl interpreter instance inside a single process
without leaking like a sieve and/or crashing. The bugs <br>
that caused this behavior have all been fixed. However, you
still must take care when embedding Perl in a C program. See
the updated perlembed manpage for tips on how to manage <br>
your interpreters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Internal change: FileHandle
class based on IO::* classes <br>
File handles are now stored internally as type IO::Handle.
The FileHandle module is still supported for backwards
compatibility, but it is now merely a front end to the IO::*
<br>
modules, specifically IO::Handle, IO::Seekable, and
IO::File. We suggest, but do not require, that you use the
IO::* modules in new code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In harmony with this change,
*GLOB{FILEHANDLE} is now just a backward-compatible synonym
for *GLOB{IO}.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Internal change: PerlIO
abstraction interface <br>
It is now possible to build Perl with AT&amp;T&rsquo;s sfio
IO package instead of stdio. See perlapio for more details,
and the INSTALL file for how to use it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">New and changed syntax <br>
$coderef-&gt;(PARAMS) <br>
A subroutine reference may now be suffixed with an arrow and
a (possibly empty) parameter list. This syntax denotes a
call of the referenced subroutine, with the given <br>
parameters (if any).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This new syntax follows the
pattern of &quot;$hashref-&gt;{FOO}&quot; and
&quot;$aryref-&gt;[$foo]&quot;: You may now write
&quot;&amp;$subref($foo)&quot; as
&quot;$subref-&gt;($foo)&quot;. All these arrow terms may be
<br>
chained; thus, &quot;&amp;{$table-&gt;{FOO}}($bar)&quot; may
now be written &quot;$table-&gt;{FOO}-&gt;($bar)&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">New and changed builtin
constants <br>
__PACKAGE__ <br>
The current package name at compile time, or the undefined
value if there is no current package (due to a
&quot;package;&quot; directive). Like &quot;__FILE__&quot;
and &quot;__LINE__&quot;, <br>
&quot;__PACKAGE__&quot; does not interpolate into
strings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">New and changed builtin
variables <br>
$^E Extended error message on some platforms. (Also known as
$EXTENDED_OS_ERROR if you &quot;use English&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$^H The current set of syntax
checks enabled by &quot;use strict&quot;. See the
documentation of &quot;strict&quot; for more details. Not
actually new, but newly documented. Because it is <br>
intended for internal use by Perl core components, there is
no &quot;use English&quot; long name for this variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$^M By default, running out of
memory it is not trappable. However, if compiled for this,
Perl may use the contents of $^M as an emergency pool after
die()ing with this message. <br>
Suppose that your Perl were compiled with
-DPERL_EMERGENCY_SBRK and used Perl&rsquo;s malloc. Then</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$^M = &rsquo;a&rsquo; x
(1&lt;&lt;16);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">would allocate a 64K buffer for
use when in emergency. See the INSTALL file for information
on how to enable this option. As a disincentive to casual
use of this advanced <br>
feature, there is no &quot;use English&quot; long name for
this variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">New and changed builtin
functions <br>
delete on slices <br>
This now works. (e.g. &quot;delete @ENV{&rsquo;PATH&rsquo;,
&rsquo;MANPATH&rsquo;}&quot;)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">flock <br>
is now supported on more platforms, prefers fcntl to lockf
when emulating, and always flushes before (un)locking.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">printf and sprintf <br>
Perl now implements these functions itself; it doesn&rsquo;t
use the C library function sprintf() any more, except for
floating-point numbers, and even then only known flags are
<br>
allowed. As a result, it is now possible to know which
conversions and flags will work, and what they will do.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The new conversions in
Perl&rsquo;s sprintf() are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%i a synonym for %d <br>
%p a pointer (the address of the Perl value, in hexadecimal)
<br>
%n special: *stores* the number of characters output so far
<br>
into the next variable in the parameter list</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The new flags that go between
the &quot;%&quot; and the conversion are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># prefix octal with
&quot;0&quot;, hex with &quot;0x&quot; <br>
h interpret integer as C type &quot;short&quot; or
&quot;unsigned short&quot; <br>
V interpret integer as Perl&rsquo;s standard integer
type</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also, where a number would
appear in the flags, an asterisk (&quot;*&quot;) may be used
instead, in which case Perl uses the next item in the
parameter list as the given number (that <br>
is, as the field width or precision). If a field width
obtained through &quot;*&quot; is negative, it has the same
effect as the &rsquo;-&rsquo; flag: left-justification.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See &quot;sprintf&quot; in
perlfunc for a complete list of conversion and flags.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">keys as an lvalue <br>
As an lvalue, &quot;keys&quot; allows you to increase the
number of hash buckets allocated for the given hash. This
can gain you a measure of efficiency if you know the hash is
going <br>
to get big. (This is similar to pre-extending an array by
assigning a larger number to $#array.) If you say</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">keys %hash = 200;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">then %hash will have at least
200 buckets allocated for it. These buckets will be retained
even if you do &quot;%hash = ()&quot;; use &quot;undef
%hash&quot; if you want to free the storage <br>
while %hash is still in scope. You can&rsquo;t shrink the
number of buckets allocated for the hash using
&quot;keys&quot; in this way (but you needn&rsquo;t worry
about doing this by accident, as <br>
trying has no effect).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">my() in Control Structures <br>
You can now use my() (with or without the parentheses) in
the control expressions of control structures such as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">while (defined(my $line =
&lt;&gt;)) { <br>
$line = lc $line; <br>
} continue { <br>
print $line; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if ((my $answer = &lt;STDIN&gt;)
=~ /^y(es)?$/i) { <br>
user_agrees(); <br>
} elsif ($answer =~ /^n(o)?$/i) { <br>
user_disagrees(); <br>
} else { <br>
chomp $answer; <br>
die &quot;&lsquo;$answer&rsquo; is neither &lsquo;yes&rsquo;
nor &lsquo;no&rsquo;&quot;; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also, you can declare a foreach
loop control variable as lexical by preceding it with the
word &quot;my&quot;. For example, in:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">foreach my $i (1, 2, 3) { <br>
some_function(); <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$i is a lexical variable, and
the scope of $i extends to the end of the loop, but not
beyond it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that you still cannot use
my() on global punctuation variables such as $_ and the
like.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pack() and unpack() <br>
A new format &rsquo;w&rsquo; represents a BER compressed
integer (as defined in ASN.1). Its format is a sequence of
one or more bytes, each of which provides seven bits of the
total <br>
value, with the most significant first. Bit eight of each
byte is set, except for the last byte, in which bit eight is
clear.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If &rsquo;p&rsquo; or
&rsquo;P&rsquo; are given undef as values, they now generate
a NULL pointer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Both pack() and unpack() now
fail when their templates contain invalid types. (Invalid
types used to be ignored.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sysseek() <br>
The new sysseek() operator is a variant of seek() that sets
and gets the file&rsquo;s system read/write position, using
the lseek(2) system call. It is the only reliable way to
<br>
seek before using sysread() or syswrite(). Its return value
is the new position, or the undefined value on failure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use VERSION <br>
If the first argument to &quot;use&quot; is a number, it is
treated as a version number instead of a module name. If the
version of the Perl interpreter is less than VERSION, then
an <br>
error message is printed and Perl exits immediately. Because
&quot;use&quot; occurs at compile time, this check happens
immediately during the compilation process, unlike
&quot;require <br>
VERSION&quot;, which waits until runtime for the check. This
is often useful if you need to check the current Perl
version before &quot;use&quot;ing library modules which have
changed in <br>
incompatible ways from older versions of Perl. (We try not
to do this more than we have to.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use Module VERSION LIST <br>
If the VERSION argument is present between Module and LIST,
then the &quot;use&quot; will call the VERSION method in
class Module with the given version as an argument. The
default <br>
VERSION method, inherited from the UNIVERSAL class, croaks
if the given version is larger than the value of the
variable $Module::VERSION. (Note that there is not a comma
<br>
after VERSION!)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This version-checking mechanism
is similar to the one currently used in the Exporter module,
but it is faster and can be used with modules that
don&rsquo;t use the Exporter. It is <br>
the recommended method for new code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">prototype(FUNCTION) <br>
Returns the prototype of a function as a string (or
&quot;undef&quot; if the function has no prototype).
FUNCTION is a reference to or the name of the function whose
prototype you <br>
want to retrieve. (Not actually new; just never documented
before.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">srand <br>
The default seed for &quot;srand&quot;, which used to be
&quot;time&quot;, has been changed. Now it&rsquo;s a heady
mix of difficult-to-predict system-dependent values, which
should be sufficient for <br>
most everyday purposes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Previous to version 5.004,
calling &quot;rand&quot; without first calling
&quot;srand&quot; would yield the same sequence of random
numbers on most or all machines. Now, when perl sees that
<br>
you&rsquo;re calling &quot;rand&quot; and haven&rsquo;t yet
called &quot;srand&quot;, it calls &quot;srand&quot; with
the default seed. You should still call &quot;srand&quot;
manually if your code might ever be run on a <br>
pre-5.004 system, of course, or if you want a seed other
than the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$_ as Default <br>
Functions documented in the Camel to default to $_ now in
fact do, and all those that do are so documented in
perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;m//gc&quot; does not reset
search position on failure <br>
The &quot;m//g&quot; match iteration construct has always
reset its target string&rsquo;s search position (which is
visible through the &quot;pos&quot; operator) when a match
fails; as a result, the <br>
next &quot;m//g&quot; match after a failure starts again at
the beginning of the string. With Perl 5.004, this reset may
be disabled by adding the &quot;c&quot; (for
&quot;continue&quot;) modifier, i.e. <br>
&quot;m//gc&quot;. This feature, in conjunction with the
&quot;G&quot; zero-width assertion, makes it possible to
chain matches together. See perlop and perlre.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;m//x&quot; ignores
whitespace before ?*+{} <br>
The &quot;m//x&quot; construct has always been intended to
ignore all unescaped whitespace. However, before Perl 5.004,
whitespace had the effect of escaping repeat modifiers like
&quot;*&quot; <br>
or &quot;?&quot;; for example, &quot;/a *b/x&quot; was
(mis)interpreted as &quot;/a/x&quot;. This bug has been
fixed in 5.004.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nested &quot;sub{}&quot;
closures work now <br>
Prior to the 5.004 release, nested anonymous functions
didn&rsquo;t work right. They do now.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">formats work right on changing
lexicals <br>
Just like anonymous functions that contain lexical variables
that change (like a lexical index variable for a
&quot;foreach&quot; loop), formats now work properly. For
example, this <br>
silently failed before (printed only zeros), but is fine
now:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">my $i; <br>
foreach $i ( 1 .. 10 ) { <br>
write; <br>
} <br>
format = <br>
my i is @# <br>
$i <br>
.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, it still fails (without
a warning) if the foreach is within a subroutine:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">my $i; <br>
sub foo { <br>
foreach $i ( 1 .. 10 ) { <br>
write; <br>
} <br>
} <br>
foo; <br>
format = <br>
my i is @# <br>
$i <br>
.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">New builtin methods <br>
The &quot;UNIVERSAL&quot; package automatically contains the
following methods that are inherited by all other
classes:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">isa(CLASS) <br>
&quot;isa&quot; returns true if its object is blessed into a
subclass of &quot;CLASS&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;isa&quot; is also
exportable and can be called as a sub with two arguments.
This allows the ability to check what a reference points to.
Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use UNIVERSAL qw(isa);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if(isa($ref,
&rsquo;ARRAY&rsquo;)) { <br>
... <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">can(METHOD) <br>
&quot;can&quot; checks to see if its object has a method
called &quot;METHOD&quot;, if it does then a reference to
the sub is returned; if it does not then undef is
returned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VERSION( [NEED] ) <br>
&quot;VERSION&quot; returns the version number of the class
(package). If the NEED argument is given then it will check
that the current version (as defined by the $VERSION
variable <br>
in the given package) not less than NEED; it will die if
this is not the case. This method is normally called as a
class method. This method is called automatically by the
<br>
&quot;VERSION&quot; form of &quot;use&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use A 1.2 qw(some imported
subs); <br>
# implies: <br>
A-&gt;VERSION(1.2);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: &quot;can&quot; directly
uses Perl&rsquo;s internal code for method lookup, and
&quot;isa&quot; uses a very similar method and caching
strategy. This may cause strange effects if the Perl code
<br>
dynamically changes @ISA in any package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may add other methods to the
UNIVERSAL class via Perl or XS code. You do not need to
&quot;use UNIVERSAL&quot; in order to make these methods
available to your program. This is <br>
necessary only if you wish to have &quot;isa&quot; available
as a plain subroutine in the current package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TIEHANDLE now supported <br>
See perltie for other kinds of tie()s.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TIEHANDLE classname, LIST <br>
This is the constructor for the class. That means it is
expected to return an object of some sort. The reference can
be used to hold some internal information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sub TIEHANDLE { <br>
print &quot;&lt;shout&gt;0; <br>
my $i; <br>
return bless , shift; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PRINT this, LIST <br>
This method will be triggered every time the tied handle is
printed to. Beyond its self reference it also expects the
list that was passed to the print function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sub PRINT { <br>
$r = shift; <br>
$$r++; <br>
return print join( $, =&gt; map {uc} @_), $; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PRINTF this, LIST <br>
This method will be triggered every time the tied handle is
printed to with the &quot;printf()&quot; function. Beyond
its self reference it also expects the format and list that
was <br>
passed to the printf function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sub PRINTF { <br>
shift; <br>
my $fmt = shift; <br>
print sprintf($fmt, @_).&quot;0; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">READ this LIST <br>
This method will be called when the handle is read from via
the &quot;read&quot; or &quot;sysread&quot; functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sub READ { <br>
$r = shift; <br>
my($buf,$len,$offset) = @_; <br>
print &quot;READ called, uf=$buf, en=$len,
ffset=$offset&quot;; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">READLINE this <br>
This method will be called when the handle is read from. The
method should return undef when there is no more data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sub READLINE { <br>
$r = shift; <br>
return &quot;PRINT called $$r times0 <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GETC this <br>
This method will be called when the &quot;getc&quot;
function is called.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sub GETC { print
&quot;Don&rsquo;t GETC, Get Perl&quot;; return
&quot;a&quot;; }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESTROY this <br>
As with the other types of ties, this method will be called
when the tied handle is about to be destroyed. This is
useful for debugging and possibly for cleaning up.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sub DESTROY { <br>
print &quot;&lt;/shout&gt;0; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Malloc enhancements <br>
If perl is compiled with the malloc included with the perl
distribution (that is, if &quot;perl -V:d_mymalloc&quot; is
&rsquo;define&rsquo;) then you can print memory statistics
at runtime by running <br>
Perl thusly:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">env PERL_DEBUG_MSTATS=2 perl
your_script_here</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The value of 2 means to print
statistics after compilation and on exit; with a value of 1,
the statistics are printed only on exit. (If you want the
statistics at an arbitrary <br>
time, you&rsquo;ll need to install the optional module
Devel::Peek.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Three new compilation flags are
recognized by malloc.c. (They have no effect if perl is
compiled with system malloc().)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-DPERL_EMERGENCY_SBRK <br>
If this macro is defined, running out of memory need not be
a fatal error: a memory pool can allocated by assigning to
the special variable $^M. See &quot;$^M&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-DPACK_MALLOC <br>
Perl memory allocation is by bucket with sizes close to
powers of two. Because of these malloc overhead may be big,
especially for data of size exactly a power of two. If <br>
&quot;PACK_MALLOC&quot; is defined, perl uses a slightly
different algorithm for small allocations (up to 64 bytes
long), which makes it possible to have overhead down to 1
byte for <br>
allocations which are powers of two (and appear quite
often).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Expected memory savings (with
8-byte alignment in &quot;alignbytes&quot;) is about 20% for
typical Perl usage. Expected slowdown due to additional
malloc overhead is in fractions of a <br>
percent (hard to measure, because of the effect of saved
memory on speed).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-DTWO_POT_OPTIMIZE <br>
Similarly to &quot;PACK_MALLOC&quot;, this macro improves
allocations of data with size close to a power of two; but
this works for big allocations (starting with 16K by
default). <br>
Such allocations are typical for big hashes and
special-purpose scripts, especially image processing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On recent systems, the fact that
perl requires 2M from system for 1M allocation will not
affect speed of execution, since the tail of such a chunk is
not going to be touched <br>
(and thus will not require real memory). However, it may
result in a premature out-of-memory error. So if you will be
manipulating very large blocks with sizes close to <br>
powers of two, it would be wise to define this macro.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Expected saving of memory is
0-100% (100% in applications which require most memory in
such 2**n chunks); expected slowdown is negligible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Miscellaneous efficiency
enhancements <br>
Functions that have an empty prototype and that do nothing
but return a fixed value are now inlined (e.g. &quot;sub PI
() { 3.14159 }&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each unique hash key is only
allocated once, no matter how many hashes have an entry with
that key. So even if you have 100 copies of the same hash,
the hash keys never have to <br>
be reallocated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Support for More Operating
Systems <br>
Support for the following operating systems is new in Perl
5.004.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Win32 <br>
Perl 5.004 now includes support for building a
&quot;native&quot; perl under Windows NT, using the
Microsoft Visual C++ compiler (versions 2.0 and above) or
the Borland C++ compiler <br>
(versions 5.02 and above). The resulting perl can be used
under Windows 95 (if it is installed in the same directory
locations as it got installed in Windows NT). This port <br>
includes support for perl extension building tools like
ExtUtils::MakeMaker and h2xs, so that many extensions
available on the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network (CPAN)
can now <br>
be readily built under Windows NT. See http://www.perl.com/
for more information on CPAN and README.win32 in the perl
distribution for more details on how to get started with
<br>
building this port.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is also support for
building perl under the Cygwin32 environment. Cygwin32 is a
set of GNU tools that make it possible to compile and run
many Unix programs under Windows <br>
NT by providing a mostly Unix-like interface for compilation
and execution. See README.cygwin32 in the perl distribution
for more details on this port and how to obtain the <br>
Cygwin32 toolkit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Plan 9 <br>
See README.plan9 in the perl distribution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">QNX <br>
See README.qnx in the perl distribution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AmigaOS <br>
See README.amigaos in the perl distribution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pragmata <br>
Six new pragmatic modules exist:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use autouse MODULE =&gt; qw(sub1
sub2 sub3) <br>
Defers &quot;require MODULE&quot; until someone calls one of
the specified subroutines (which must be exported by
MODULE). This pragma should be used with caution, and only
when <br>
necessary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use blib <br>
use blib &rsquo;dir&rsquo; <br>
Looks for MakeMaker-like &rsquo;blib&rsquo; directory
structure starting in dir (or current directory) and working
back up to five levels of parent directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Intended for use on command line
with -M option as a way of testing arbitrary scripts against
an uninstalled version of a package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use constant NAME =&gt; VALUE
<br>
Provides a convenient interface for creating compile-time
constants, See &quot;Constant Functions&quot; in
perlsub.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use locale <br>
Tells the compiler to enable (or disable) the use of POSIX
locales for builtin operations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When &quot;use locale&quot; is
in effect, the current LC_CTYPE locale is used for regular
expressions and case mapping; LC_COLLATE for string
ordering; and LC_NUMERIC for numeric <br>
formatting in printf and sprintf (but not in print).
LC_NUMERIC is always used in write, since lexical scoping of
formats is problematic at best.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each &quot;use locale&quot; or
&quot;no locale&quot; affects statements to the end of the
enclosing BLOCK or, if not inside a BLOCK, to the end of the
current file. Locales can be switched and <br>
queried with POSIX::setlocale().</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See perllocale for more
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use ops <br>
Disable unsafe opcodes, or any named opcodes, when compiling
Perl code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use vmsish <br>
Enable VMS-specific language features. Currently, there are
three VMS-specific features available: &rsquo;status&rsquo;,
which makes $? and &quot;system&quot; return genuine VMS
status values <br>
instead of emulating POSIX; &rsquo;exit&rsquo;, which makes
&quot;exit&quot; take a genuine VMS status value instead of
assuming that &quot;exit 1&quot; is an error; and
&rsquo;time&rsquo;, which makes all times <br>
relative to the local time zone, in the VMS tradition.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Modules <br>
Required Updates <br>
Though Perl 5.004 is compatible with almost all modules that
work with Perl 5.003, there are a few exceptions:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Module Required Version for Perl
5.004 <br>
------ ------------------------------- <br>
Filter Filter-1.12 <br>
LWP libwww-perl-5.08 <br>
Tk Tk400.202 (-w makes noise)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also, the majordomo mailing list
program, version 1.94.1, doesn&rsquo;t work with Perl 5.004
(nor with perl 4), because it executes an invalid regular
expression. This bug is fixed in <br>
majordomo version 1.94.2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Installation directories <br>
The installperl script now places the Perl source files for
extensions in the architecture-specific library directory,
which is where the shared libraries for extensions have <br>
always been. This change is intended to allow administrators
to keep the Perl 5.004 library directory unchanged from a
previous version, without running the risk of binary <br>
incompatibility between extensions&rsquo; Perl source and
shared libraries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Module information summary <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tie/RefHash.pm Base class for
tied hashes with references as keys</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UNIVERSAL.pm Base class for
*ALL* classes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fcntl <br>
New constants in the existing Fcntl modules are now
supported, provided that your operating system happens to
support them:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">F_GETOWN F_SETOWN <br>
O_ASYNC O_DEFER O_DSYNC O_FSYNC O_SYNC <br>
O_EXLOCK O_SHLOCK</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These constants are intended for
use with the Perl operators sysopen() and fcntl() and the
basic database modules like SDBM_File. For the exact meaning
of these and other Fcntl <br>
constants please refer to your operating system&rsquo;s
documentation for fcntl() and open().</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition, the Fcntl module
now provides these constants for use with the Perl operator
flock():</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LOCK_SH LOCK_EX LOCK_NB
LOCK_UN</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These constants are defined in
all environments (because where there is no flock() system
call, Perl emulates it). However, for historical reasons,
these constants are not <br>
exported unless they are explicitly requested with the
&quot;:flock&quot; tag (e.g. &quot;use Fcntl
&rsquo;:flock&rsquo;&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IO <br>
The IO module provides a simple mechanism to load all the IO
modules at one go. Currently this includes:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IO::Handle <br>
IO::Seekable <br>
IO::File <br>
IO::Pipe <br>
IO::Socket</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For more information on any of
these modules, please see its respective documentation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Math::Complex <br>
The Math::Complex module has been totally rewritten, and now
supports more operations. These are overloaded:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+ - * / ** &lt;=&gt; neg ~ abs
sqrt exp log sin cos atan2 &quot;&quot; (stringify)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">And these functions are now
exported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pi i Re Im arg <br>
log10 logn ln cbrt root <br>
tan <br>
csc sec cot <br>
asin acos atan <br>
acsc asec acot <br>
sinh cosh tanh <br>
csch sech coth <br>
asinh acosh atanh <br>
acsch asech acoth <br>
cplx cplxe</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Math::Trig <br>
This new module provides a simpler interface to parts of
Math::Complex for those who need trigonometric functions
only for real numbers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DB_File <br>
There have been quite a few changes made to DB_File. Here
are a few of the highlights:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Fixed a handful
of bugs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; By public
demand, added support for the standard hash function
exists().</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Made it
compatible with Berkeley DB 1.86.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Made negative
subscripts work with RECNO interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Changed the
default flags from O_RDWR to O_CREAT|O_RDWR and the default
mode from 0640 to 0666.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Made DB_File
automatically import the open() constants (O_RDWR, O_CREAT
etc.) from Fcntl, if available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Updated
documentation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Refer to the HISTORY section in
DB_File.pm for a complete list of changes. Everything after
DB_File 1.01 has been added since 5.003.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Net::Ping <br>
Major rewrite - support added for both udp echo and real
icmp pings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Object-oriented overrides for
builtin operators <br>
Many of the Perl builtins returning lists now have
object-oriented overrides. These are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File::stat <br>
Net::hostent <br>
Net::netent <br>
Net::protoent <br>
Net::servent <br>
Time::gmtime <br>
Time::localtime <br>
User::grent <br>
User::pwent</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, you can now say</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use File::stat; <br>
use User::pwent; <br>
$his = (stat($filename)-&gt;st_uid ==
pwent($whoever)-&gt;pw_uid);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Utility Changes <br>
pod2html <br>
Sends converted HTML to standard output <br>
The pod2html utility included with Perl 5.004 is entirely
new. By default, it sends the converted HTML to its standard
output, instead of writing it to a file like Perl <br>
5.003&rsquo;s pod2html did. Use the --outfile=FILENAME
option to write to a file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xsubpp <br>
&quot;void&quot; XSUBs now default to returning nothing <br>
Due to a documentation/implementation bug in previous
versions of Perl, XSUBs with a return type of
&quot;void&quot; have actually been returning one value.
Usually that value was the <br>
GV for the XSUB, but sometimes it was some already freed or
reused value, which would sometimes lead to program
failure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In Perl 5.004, if an XSUB is
declared as returning &quot;void&quot;, it actually returns
no value, i.e. an empty list (though there is a
backward-compatibility exception; see below). <br>
If your XSUB really does return an SV, you should give it a
return type of &quot;SV *&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For backward compatibility,
xsubpp tries to guess whether a &quot;void&quot; XSUB is
really &quot;void&quot; or if it wants to return an &quot;SV
*&quot;. It does so by examining the text of the XSUB: if
<br>
xsubpp finds what looks like an assignment to ST(0), it
assumes that the XSUB&rsquo;s return type is really &quot;SV
*&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C Language API Changes <br>
&quot;gv_fetchmethod&quot; and &quot;perl_call_sv&quot; <br>
The &quot;gv_fetchmethod&quot; function finds a method for
an object, just like in Perl 5.003. The GV it returns may be
a method cache entry. However, in Perl 5.004, method cache
<br>
entries are not visible to users; therefore, they can no
longer be passed directly to &quot;perl_call_sv&quot;.
Instead, you should use the &quot;GvCV&quot; macro on the GV
to extract its CV, <br>
and pass the CV to &quot;perl_call_sv&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The most likely symptom of
passing the result of &quot;gv_fetchmethod&quot; to
&quot;perl_call_sv&quot; is Perl&rsquo;s producing an
&quot;Undefined subroutine called&quot; error on the second
call to a given <br>
method (since there is no cache on the first call).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;perl_eval_pv&quot; <br>
A new function handy for eval&rsquo;ing strings of Perl code
inside C code. This function returns the value from the eval
statement, which can be used instead of fetching globals
<br>
from the symbol table. See perlguts, perlembed and perlcall
for details and examples.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Extended API for manipulating
hashes <br>
Internal handling of hash keys has changed. The old
hashtable API is still fully supported, and will likely
remain so. The additions to the API allow passing keys as
<br>
&quot;SV*&quot;s, so that &quot;tied&quot; hashes can be
given real scalars as keys rather than plain strings
(nontied hashes still can only use strings as keys). New
extensions must use the <br>
new hash access functions and macros if they wish to use
&quot;SV*&quot; keys. These additions also make it feasible
to manipulate &quot;HE*&quot;s (hash entries), which can be
more efficient. <br>
See perlguts for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Documentation Changes <br>

(W) A lexical variable has been redeclared in the same
scope, effectively eliminating all access to the previous
instance. This is almost always a typographical error. Note
<br>
that the earlier variable will still exist until the end of
the scope or until all closure referents to it are
destroyed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%s argument is not a HASH
element or slice <br>
(F) The argument to delete() must be either a hash element,
such as</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$foo{$bar} <br>
$ref-&gt;[12]-&gt;{&quot;susie&quot;}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or a hash slice, such as</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@foo{$bar, $baz, $xyzzy} <br>
@{$ref-&gt;[12]}{&quot;susie&quot;, &quot;queue&quot;}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Allocation too large: %lx <br>
(X) You can&rsquo;t allocate more than 64K on an MS-DOS
machine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Allocation too large <br>
(F) You can&rsquo;t allocate more than 2^31+&quot;small
amount&quot; bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Applying %s to %s will act on
scalar(%s) <br>
(W) The pattern match (//), substitution (s///), and
transliteration (tr///) operators work on scalar values. If
you apply one of them to an array or a hash, it will convert
<br>
the array or hash to a scalar value (the length of an array
or the population info of a hash) and then work on that
scalar value. This is probably not what you meant to do.
<br>
See &quot;grep&quot; in perlfunc and &quot;map&quot; in
perlfunc for alternatives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Attempt to free nonexistent
shared string <br>
(P) Perl maintains a reference counted internal table of
strings to optimize the storage and access of hash keys and
other strings. This indicates someone tried to decrement
<br>
the reference count of a string that can no longer be found
in the table.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Attempt to use reference as
lvalue in substr <br>
(W) You supplied a reference as the first argument to
substr() used as an lvalue, which is pretty strange. Perhaps
you forgot to dereference it first. See &quot;substr&quot;
in <br>
perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bareword &quot;%s&quot; refers
to nonexistent package <br>
(W) You used a qualified bareword of the form
&quot;Foo::&quot;, but the compiler saw no other uses of
that namespace before that point. Perhaps you need to
predeclare a package?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t redefine active sort
subroutine %s <br>
(F) Perl optimizes the internal handling of sort subroutines
and keeps pointers into them. You tried to redefine one such
sort subroutine when it was currently active, which <br>
is not allowed. If you really want to do this, you should
write &quot;sort { &amp;func } @x&quot; instead of
&quot;sort func @x&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t use bareword
(&quot;%s&quot;) as %s ref while &quot;strict refs&quot; in
use <br>
(F) Only hard references are allowed by &quot;strict
refs&quot;. Symbolic references are disallowed. See
perlref.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cannot resolve method
&lsquo;%s&rsquo; overloading &lsquo;%s&rsquo; in package
&lsquo;%s&rsquo; <br>
(P) Internal error trying to resolve overloading specified
by a method name (as opposed to a subroutine reference).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Constant subroutine %s redefined
<br>
(S) You redefined a subroutine which had previously been
eligible for inlining. See &quot;Constant Functions&quot; in
perlsub for commentary and workarounds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Constant subroutine %s undefined
<br>
(S) You undefined a subroutine which had previously been
eligible for inlining. See &quot;Constant Functions&quot; in
perlsub for commentary and workarounds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Copy method did not return a
reference <br>
(F) The method which overloads &quot;=&quot; is buggy. See
&quot;Copy Constructor&quot; in overload.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Died <br>
(F) You passed die() an empty string (the equivalent of
&quot;die &quot;&quot;&quot;) or you called it with no args
and both $@ and $_ were empty.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Exiting pseudo-block via %s <br>
(W) You are exiting a rather special block construct (like a
sort block or subroutine) by unconventional means, such as a
goto, or a loop control statement. See &quot;sort&quot; in
<br>
perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Identifier too long <br>
(F) Perl limits identifiers (names for variables, functions,
etc.) to 252 characters for simple names, somewhat more for
compound names (like $A::B). You&rsquo;ve exceeded
Perl&rsquo;s <br>
limits. Future versions of Perl are likely to eliminate
these arbitrary limitations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Illegal character %s (carriage
return) <br>
(F) A carriage return character was found in the input. This
is an error, and not a warning, because carriage return
characters can break multi-line strings, including here <br>
documents (e.g., &quot;print &lt;&lt;EOF;&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Illegal switch in PERL5OPT: %s
<br>
(X) The PERL5OPT environment variable may only be used to
set the following switches: -[DIMUdmw].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Integer overflow in hex number
<br>
(S) The literal hex number you have specified is too big for
your architecture. On a 32-bit architecture the largest hex
literal is 0xFFFFFFFF.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Integer overflow in octal number
<br>
(S) The literal octal number you have specified is too big
for your architecture. On a 32-bit architecture the largest
octal literal is 037777777777.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">internal error: glob failed <br>
(P) Something went wrong with the external program(s) used
for &quot;glob&quot; and &quot;&lt;*.c&gt;&quot;. This may
mean that your csh (C shell) is broken. If so, you should
change all of the csh- <br>
related variables in config.sh: If you have tcsh, make the
variables refer to it as if it were csh (e.g.
&quot;full_csh=&rsquo;/usr/bin/tcsh&rsquo;&quot;);
otherwise, make them all empty (except <br>
that &quot;d_csh&quot; should be &rsquo;undef&rsquo;) so
that Perl will think csh is missing. In either case, after
editing config.sh, run &quot;./Configure -S&quot; and
rebuild Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Invalid conversion in %s:
&quot;%s&quot; <br>
(W) Perl does not understand the given format conversion.
See &quot;sprintf&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Invalid type in pack:
&rsquo;%s&rsquo; <br>
(F) The given character is not a valid pack type. See
&quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Invalid type in unpack:
&rsquo;%s&rsquo; <br>
(F) The given character is not a valid unpack type. See
&quot;unpack&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Name &quot;%s::%s&quot; used
only once: possible typo <br>
(W) Typographical errors often show up as unique variable
names. If you had a good reason for having a unique name,
then just mention it again somehow to suppress the <br>
message (the &quot;use vars&quot; pragma is provided for
just this purpose).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Null picture in formline <br>
(F) The first argument to formline must be a valid format
picture specification. It was found to be empty, which
probably means you supplied it an uninitialized value. See
<br>
perlform.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Offset outside string <br>
(F) You tried to do a read/write/send/recv operation with an
offset pointing outside the buffer. This is difficult to
imagine. The sole exception to this is that <br>
&quot;sysread()&quot;ing past the buffer will extend the
buffer and zero pad the new area.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Out of memory! <br>
(X|F) The malloc() function returned 0, indicating there was
insufficient remaining memory (or virtual memory) to satisfy
the request.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The request was judged to be
small, so the possibility to trap it depends on the way Perl
was compiled. By default it is not trappable. However, if
compiled for this, Perl <br>
may use the contents of $^M as an emergency pool after
die()ing with this message. In this case the error is
trappable once.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Out of memory during request for
%s <br>
(F) The malloc() function returned 0, indicating there was
insufficient remaining memory (or virtual memory) to satisfy
the request. However, the request was judged large <br>
enough (compile-time default is 64K), so a possibility to
shut down by trapping this error is granted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">panic: frexp <br>
(P) The library function frexp() failed, making
printf(&quot;%f&quot;) impossible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Possible attempt to put comments
in qw() list <br>
(W) qw() lists contain items separated by whitespace; as
with literal strings, comment characters are not ignored,
but are instead treated as literal data. (You may have <br>
used different delimiters than the parentheses shown here;
braces are also frequently used.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You probably wrote something
like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@list = qw( <br>
a # a comment <br>
b # another comment <br>
);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">when you should have written
this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@list = qw( <br>
a <br>
b <br>
);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you really want comments,
build your list the old-fashioned way, with quotes and
commas:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@list = ( <br>
&rsquo;a&rsquo;, # a comment <br>
&rsquo;b&rsquo;, # another comment <br>
);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Possible attempt to separate
words with commas <br>
(W) qw() lists contain items separated by whitespace;
therefore commas aren&rsquo;t needed to separate the items.
(You may have used different delimiters than the parentheses
shown <br>
here; braces are also frequently used.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You probably wrote something
like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">qw! a, b, c !;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">which puts literal commas into
some of the list items. Write it without commas if you
don&rsquo;t want them to appear in your data:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">qw! a b c !;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Scalar value @%s{%s} better
written as $%s{%s} <br>
(W) You&rsquo;ve used a hash slice (indicated by @) to
select a single element of a hash. Generally it&rsquo;s
better to ask for a scalar value (indicated by $). The
difference is that <br>
$foo{&amp;bar} always behaves like a scalar, both when
assigning to it and when evaluating its argument, while
@foo{&amp;bar} behaves like a list when you assign to it,
and provides <br>
a list context to its subscript, which can do weird things
if you&rsquo;re expecting only one subscript.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Stub found while resolving
method &lsquo;%s&rsquo; overloading &lsquo;%s&rsquo; in %s
<br>
(P) Overloading resolution over @ISA tree may be broken by
importing stubs. Stubs should never be implicitly created,
but explicit calls to &quot;can&quot; may break this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Too late for &quot;-T&quot;
option <br>
(X) The #! line (or local equivalent) in a Perl script
contains the -T option, but Perl was not invoked with -T in
its argument list. This is an error because, by the time
<br>
Perl discovers a -T in a script, it&rsquo;s too late to
properly taint everything from the environment. So Perl
gives up.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">untie attempted while %d inner
references still exist <br>
(W) A copy of the object returned from &quot;tie&quot; (or
&quot;tied&quot;) was still valid when &quot;untie&quot; was
called.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unrecognized character %s <br>
(F) The Perl parser has no idea what to do with the
specified character in your Perl script (or eval). Perhaps
you tried to run a compressed script, a binary program, or a
<br>
directory as a Perl program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unsupported function fork <br>
(F) Your version of executable does not support forking.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that under some systems,
like OS/2, there may be different flavors of Perl
executables, some of which may support fork, some not. Try
changing the name you call Perl by <br>
to &quot;perl_&quot;, &quot;perl__&quot;, and so on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use of
&quot;$$&lt;digit&gt;&quot; to mean
&quot;${$}&lt;digit&gt;&quot; is deprecated <br>
(D) Perl versions before 5.004 misinterpreted any type
marker followed by &quot;$&quot; and a digit. For example,
&quot;$$0&quot; was incorrectly taken to mean
&quot;${$}0&quot; instead of &quot;${$0}&quot;. This <br>
bug is (mostly) fixed in Perl 5.004.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, the developers of Perl
5.004 could not fix this bug completely, because at least
two widely-used modules depend on the old meaning of
&quot;$$0&quot; in a string. So Perl <br>
5.004 still interprets &quot;$$&lt;digit&gt;&quot; in the
old (broken) way inside strings; but it generates this
message as a warning. And in Perl 5.005, this special
treatment will cease.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Value of %s can be
&quot;0&quot;; test with defined() <br>
(W) In a conditional expression, you used &lt;HANDLE&gt;,
&lt;*&gt; (glob), &quot;each()&quot;, or
&quot;readdir()&quot; as a boolean value. Each of these
constructs can return a value of &quot;0&quot;; that would
<br>
make the conditional expression false, which is probably not
what you intended. When using these constructs in
conditional expressions, test their values with the
&quot;defined&quot; <br>
operator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Variable &quot;%s&quot; may be
unavailable <br>
(W) An inner (nested) anonymous subroutine is inside a named
subroutine, and outside that is another subroutine; and the
anonymous (innermost) subroutine is referencing a <br>
lexical variable defined in the outermost subroutine. For
example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sub outermost { my $a; sub
middle { sub { $a } } }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the anonymous subroutine is
called or referenced (directly or indirectly) from the
outermost subroutine, it will share the variable as you
would expect. But if the <br>
anonymous subroutine is called or referenced when the
outermost subroutine is not active, it will see the value of
the shared variable as it was before and during the *first*
<br>
call to the outermost subroutine, which is probably not what
you want.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In these circumstances, it is
usually best to make the middle subroutine anonymous, using
the &quot;sub {}&quot; syntax. Perl has specific support for
shared variables in nested <br>
anonymous subroutines; a named subroutine in between
interferes with this feature.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Variable &quot;%s&quot; will not
stay shared <br>
(W) An inner (nested) named subroutine is referencing a
lexical variable defined in an outer subroutine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the inner subroutine is
called, it will probably see the value of the outer
subroutine&rsquo;s variable as it was before and during the
*first* call to the outer subroutine; <br>
in this case, after the first call to the outer subroutine
is complete, the inner and outer subroutines will no longer
share a common value for the variable. In other words, <br>
the variable will no longer be shared.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Furthermore, if the outer
subroutine is anonymous and references a lexical variable
outside itself, then the outer and inner subroutines will
never share the given variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This problem can usually be
solved by making the inner subroutine anonymous, using the
&quot;sub {}&quot; syntax. When inner anonymous subs that
reference variables in outer <br>
subroutines are called or referenced, they are automatically
rebound to the current values of such variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning: something&rsquo;s wrong
<br>
(W) You passed warn() an empty string (the equivalent of
&quot;warn &quot;&quot;&quot;) or you called it with no args
and $_ was empty.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ill-formed logical name |%s| in
prime_env_iter <br>
(W) A warning peculiar to VMS. A logical name was
encountered when preparing to iterate over %ENV which
violates the syntactic rules governing logical names. Since
it <br>
cannot be translated normally, it is skipped, and will not
appear in %ENV. This may be a benign occurrence, as some
software packages might directly modify logical name <br>
tables and introduce nonstandard names, or it may indicate
that a logical name table has been corrupted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Got an error from DosAllocMem
<br>
(P) An error peculiar to OS/2. Most probably you&rsquo;re
using an obsolete version of Perl, and this should not
happen anyway.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Malformed PERLLIB_PREFIX <br>
(F) An error peculiar to OS/2. PERLLIB_PREFIX should be of
the form</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">prefix1;prefix2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">prefix1 prefix2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">with nonempty prefix1 and
prefix2. If &quot;prefix1&quot; is indeed a prefix of a
builtin library search path, prefix2 is substituted. The
error may appear if components are not <br>
found, or are too long. See &quot;PERLLIB_PREFIX&quot; in
README.os2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PERL_SH_DIR too long <br>
(F) An error peculiar to OS/2. PERL_SH_DIR is the directory
to find the &quot;sh&quot;-shell in. See
&quot;PERL_SH_DIR&quot; in README.os2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Process terminated by SIG%s <br>
(W) This is a standard message issued by OS/2 applications,
while *nix applications die in silence. It is considered a
feature of the OS/2 port. One can easily disable this <br>
by appropriate sighandlers, see &quot;Signals&quot; in
perlipc. See also &quot;Process terminated by
SIGTERM/SIGINT&quot; in README.os2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
