perl5004delta - what's new for perl5.004
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
This document describes differences between the 5.003 release (as documented in
  <i>Programming Perl</i>, second edition--the Camel Book) and this one.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Supported_Environments"><a class="selflink" href="#Supported_Environments">Supported
  Environments</a></h1>
Perl5.004 builds out of the box on Unix, Plan 9, LynxOS, VMS, OS/2, QNX,
  AmigaOS, and Windows NT. Perl runs on Windows 95 as well, but it cannot be
  built there, for lack of a reasonable command interpreter.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Core_Changes"><a class="selflink" href="#Core_Changes">Core
  Changes</a></h1>
Most importantly, many bugs were fixed, including several security problems. See
  the <i>Changes</i> file in the distribution for details.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="List_assignment_to_%ENV_works"><a class="selflink" href="#List_assignment_to_%ENV_works">List
  assignment to %ENV works</a></h2>
&quot;%ENV = ()&quot; and &quot;%ENV = @list&quot; now work as expected (except
  on VMS where it generates a fatal error).
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Change_to_&quot;Can't_locate_Foo.pm_in_@INC&quot;_error"><a class="selflink" href="#Change_to_&quot;Can't_locate_Foo.pm_in_@INC&quot;_error">Change
  to &quot;Can't locate Foo.pm in @INC&quot; error</a></h2>
The error &quot;Can't locate Foo.pm in @INC&quot; now lists the contents of @INC
  for easier debugging.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Compilation_option:_Binary_compatibility_with_5.003"><a class="selflink" href="#Compilation_option:_Binary_compatibility_with_5.003">Compilation
  option: Binary compatibility with 5.003</a></h2>
There is a new Configure question that asks if you want to maintain binary
  compatibility with Perl 5.003. If you choose binary compatibility, you do not
  have to recompile your extensions, but you might have symbol conflicts if you
  embed Perl in another application, just as in the 5.003 release. By default,
  binary compatibility is preserved at the expense of symbol table pollution.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="$PERL5OPT_environment_variable"><a class="selflink" href="#$PERL5OPT_environment_variable">$PERL5OPT
  environment variable</a></h2>
You may now put Perl options in the $PERL5OPT environment variable. Unless Perl
  is running with taint checks, it will interpret this variable as if its
  contents had appeared on a &quot;#!perl&quot; line at the beginning of your
  script, except that hyphens are optional. PERL5OPT may only be used to set the
  following switches: <b>-[DIMUdmw]</b>.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Limitations_on_-M,_-m,_and_-T_options"><a class="selflink" href="#Limitations_on_-M,_-m,_and_-T_options">Limitations
  on <b>-M</b>, <b>-m</b>, and <b>-T</b> options</a></h2>
The &quot;-M&quot; and &quot;-m&quot; options are no longer allowed on the
  &quot;#!&quot; line of a script. If a script needs a module, it should invoke
  it with the &quot;use&quot; pragma.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-T</b> option is also forbidden on the &quot;#!&quot; line of a script,
  unless it was present on the Perl command line. Due to the way &quot;#!&quot;
  works, this usually means that <b>-T</b> must be in the first argument. Thus:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    #!/usr/bin/perl -T -w
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
will probably work for an executable script invoked as &quot;scriptname&quot;,
  while:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    #!/usr/bin/perl -w -T
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
will probably fail under the same conditions. (Non-Unix systems will probably
  not follow this rule.) But &quot;perl scriptname&quot; is guaranteed to fail,
  since then there is no chance of <b>-T</b> being found on the command line
  before it is found on the &quot;#!&quot; line.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="More_precise_warnings"><a class="selflink" href="#More_precise_warnings">More
  precise warnings</a></h2>
If you removed the <b>-w</b> option from your Perl 5.003 scripts because it made
  Perl too verbose, we recommend that you try putting it back when you upgrade
  to Perl 5.004. Each new perl version tends to remove some undesirable
  warnings, while adding new warnings that may catch bugs in your scripts.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Deprecated:_Inherited_&quot;AUTOLOAD&quot;_for_non-methods"><a class="selflink" href="#Deprecated:_Inherited_&quot;AUTOLOAD&quot;_for_non-methods">Deprecated:
  Inherited &quot;AUTOLOAD&quot; for non-methods</a></h2>
Before Perl 5.004, &quot;AUTOLOAD&quot; functions were looked up as methods
  (using the @ISA hierarchy), even when the function to be autoloaded was called
  as a plain function (e.g. &quot;Foo::bar()&quot;), not a method (e.g.
  &quot;Foo-&gt;bar()&quot; or &quot;$obj-&gt;bar()&quot;).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Perl 5.005 will use method lookup only for methods' &quot;AUTOLOAD&quot;s.
  However, there is a significant base of existing code that may be using the
  old behavior. So, as an interim step, Perl 5.004 issues an optional warning
  when a non-method uses an inherited &quot;AUTOLOAD&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The simple rule is: Inheritance will not work when autoloading non-methods. The
  simple fix for old code is: In any module that used to depend on inheriting
  &quot;AUTOLOAD&quot; for non-methods from a base class named
  &quot;BaseClass&quot;, execute &quot;*AUTOLOAD =
  \&amp;BaseClass::AUTOLOAD&quot; during startup.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Previously_deprecated_%OVERLOAD_is_no_longer_usable"><a class="selflink" href="#Previously_deprecated_%OVERLOAD_is_no_longer_usable">Previously
  deprecated %OVERLOAD is no longer usable</a></h2>
Using %OVERLOAD to define overloading was deprecated in 5.003. Overloading is
  now defined using the overload pragma. %OVERLOAD is still used internally but
  should not be used by Perl scripts. See overload for more details.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Subroutine_arguments_created_only_when_they're_modified"><a class="selflink" href="#Subroutine_arguments_created_only_when_they're_modified">Subroutine
  arguments created only when they're modified</a></h2>
In Perl 5.004, nonexistent array and hash elements used as subroutine parameters
  are brought into existence only if they are actually assigned to (via @_).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Earlier versions of Perl vary in their handling of such arguments. Perl versions
  5.002 and 5.003 always brought them into existence. Perl versions 5.000 and
  5.001 brought them into existence only if they were not the first argument
  (which was almost certainly a bug). Earlier versions of Perl never brought
  them into existence.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For example, given this code:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
     undef @a; undef %a;
     sub show { print $_[0] };
     sub change { $_[0]++ };
     show($a[2]);
     change($a{b});
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
After this code executes in Perl 5.004, $a{b} exists but $a[2] does not. In Perl
  5.002 and 5.003, both $a{b} and $a[2] would have existed (but $a[2]'s value
  would have been undefined).
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Group_vector_changeable_with_$)"><a class="selflink" href="#Group_vector_changeable_with_$)">Group
  vector changeable with $)</a></h2>
The $) special variable has always (well, in Perl 5, at least) reflected not
  only the current effective group, but also the group list as returned by the
  &quot;getgroups()&quot; C function (if there is one). However, until this
  release, there has not been a way to call the &quot;setgroups()&quot; C
  function from Perl.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In Perl 5.004, assigning to $) is exactly symmetrical with examining it: The
  first number in its string value is used as the effective gid; if there are
  any numbers after the first one, they are passed to the
  &quot;setgroups()&quot; C function (if there is one).
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Fixed_parsing_of_$$&lt;digit&gt;,_&amp;$&lt;digit&gt;,_etc."><a class="selflink" href="#Fixed_parsing_of_$$&lt;digit&gt;,_&amp;$&lt;digit&gt;,_etc.">Fixed
  parsing of $$&lt;digit&gt;, &amp;$&lt;digit&gt;, etc.</a></h2>
Perl versions before 5.004 misinterpreted any type marker followed by
  &quot;$&quot; and a digit. For example, &quot;$$0&quot; was incorrectly taken
  to mean &quot;${$}0&quot; instead of &quot;${$0}&quot;. This bug is (mostly)
  fixed in Perl 5.004.
<div class="Pp"></div>
However, the developers of Perl 5.004 could not fix this bug completely, because
  at least two widely-used modules depend on the old meaning of &quot;$$0&quot;
  in a string. So Perl 5.004 still interprets &quot;$$&lt;digit&gt;&quot; in the
  old (broken) way inside strings; but it generates this message as a warning.
  And in Perl 5.005, this special treatment will cease.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Fixed_localization_of_$&lt;digit&gt;,_$&amp;,_etc."><a class="selflink" href="#Fixed_localization_of_$&lt;digit&gt;,_$&amp;,_etc.">Fixed
  localization of $&lt;digit&gt;, $&amp;, etc.</a></h2>
Perl versions before 5.004 did not always properly localize the regex-related
  special variables. Perl 5.004 does localize them, as the documentation has
  always said it should. This may result in $1, $2, etc. no longer being set
  where existing programs use them.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="No_resetting_of_$._on_implicit_close"><a class="selflink" href="#No_resetting_of_$._on_implicit_close">No
  resetting of $. on implicit close</a></h2>
The documentation for Perl 5.0 has always stated that $. is <i>not</i> reset
  when an already-open file handle is reopened with no intervening call to
  &quot;close&quot;. Due to a bug, perl versions 5.000 through 5.003 <i>did</i>
  reset $. under that circumstance; Perl 5.004 does not.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="&quot;wantarray&quot;_may_return_undef"><a class="selflink" href="#&quot;wantarray&quot;_may_return_undef">&quot;wantarray&quot;
  may return undef</a></h2>
The &quot;wantarray&quot; operator returns true if a subroutine is expected to
  return a list, and false otherwise. In Perl 5.004, &quot;wantarray&quot; can
  also return the undefined value if a subroutine's return value will not be
  used at all, which allows subroutines to avoid a time-consuming calculation of
  a return value if it isn't going to be used.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="&quot;eval_EXPR&quot;_determines_value_of_EXPR_in_scalar_context"><a class="selflink" href="#&quot;eval_EXPR&quot;_determines_value_of_EXPR_in_scalar_context">&quot;eval
  EXPR&quot; determines value of EXPR in scalar context</a></h2>
Perl (version 5) used to determine the value of EXPR inconsistently, sometimes
  incorrectly using the surrounding context for the determination. Now, the
  value of EXPR (before being parsed by eval) is always determined in a scalar
  context. Once parsed, it is executed as before, by providing the context that
  the scope surrounding the eval provided. This change makes the behavior Perl4
  compatible, besides fixing bugs resulting from the inconsistent behavior. This
  program:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    @a = qw(time now is time);
    print eval @a;
    print '|', scalar eval @a;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
used to print something like &quot;timenowis881399109|4&quot;, but now (and in
  perl4) prints &quot;4|4&quot;.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Changes_to_tainting_checks"><a class="selflink" href="#Changes_to_tainting_checks">Changes
  to tainting checks</a></h2>
A bug in previous versions may have failed to detect some insecure conditions
  when taint checks are turned on. (Taint checks are used in setuid or setgid
  scripts, or when explicitly turned on with the &quot;-T&quot; invocation
  option.) Although it's unlikely, this may cause a previously-working script to
  now fail, which should be construed as a blessing since that indicates a
  potentially-serious security hole was just plugged.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The new restrictions when tainting include:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">No <i>glob()</i> or &lt;*&gt;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">These operators may spawn the C shell (csh), which cannot
      be made safe. This restriction will be lifted in a future version of Perl
      when globbing is implemented without the use of an external program.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">No spawning if tainted $CDPATH, $ENV, $BASH_ENV</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">These environment variables may alter the behavior of
      spawned programs (especially shells) in ways that subvert security. So now
      they are treated as dangerous, in the manner of $IFS and $PATH.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">No spawning if tainted $TERM doesn't look like a terminal
    name</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Some termcap libraries do unsafe things with $TERM.
      However, it would be unnecessarily harsh to treat all $TERM values as
      unsafe, since only shell metacharacters can cause trouble in $TERM. So a
      tainted $TERM is considered to be safe if it contains only alphanumerics,
      underscores, dashes, and colons, and unsafe if it contains other
      characters (including whitespace).</dd>
</dl>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="New_Opcode_module_and_revised_Safe_module"><a class="selflink" href="#New_Opcode_module_and_revised_Safe_module">New
  Opcode module and revised Safe module</a></h2>
A new Opcode module supports the creation, manipulation and application of
  opcode masks. The revised Safe module has a new API and is implemented using
  the new Opcode module. Please read the new Opcode and Safe documentation.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Embedding_improvements"><a class="selflink" href="#Embedding_improvements">Embedding
  improvements</a></h2>
In older versions of Perl it was not possible to create more than one Perl
  interpreter instance inside a single process without leaking like a sieve
  and/or crashing. The bugs that caused this behavior have all been fixed.
  However, you still must take care when embedding Perl in a C program. See the
  updated perlembed manpage for tips on how to manage your interpreters.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Internal_change:_FileHandle_class_based_on_IO::*_classes"><a class="selflink" href="#Internal_change:_FileHandle_class_based_on_IO::*_classes">Internal
  change: FileHandle class based on IO::* classes</a></h2>
File handles are now stored internally as type IO::Handle. The FileHandle module
  is still supported for backwards compatibility, but it is now merely a front
  end to the IO::* modules, specifically IO::Handle, IO::Seekable, and IO::File.
  We suggest, but do not require, that you use the IO::* modules in new code.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In harmony with this change, *GLOB{FILEHANDLE} is now just a backward-compatible
  synonym for *GLOB{IO}.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Internal_change:_PerlIO_abstraction_interface"><a class="selflink" href="#Internal_change:_PerlIO_abstraction_interface">Internal
  change: PerlIO abstraction interface</a></h2>
It is now possible to build Perl with AT&amp;T's sfio IO package instead of
  stdio. See perlapio for more details, and the <i>INSTALL</i> file for how to
  use it.

    This new syntax follows the pattern of &quot;$hashref-&gt;{FOO}&quot; and

      and what they will do.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The new conversions in Perl's <i>sprintf()</i> are:

    <pre>
   %i   a synonym for %d

    <pre>
   #    prefix octal with &quot;0&quot;, hex with &quot;0x&quot;

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Also, where a number would appear in the flags, an asterisk (&quot;*&quot;)
      may be used instead, in which case Perl uses the next item in the
      parameter list as the given number (that is, as the field width or
      precision). If a field width obtained through &quot;*&quot; is negative,
      it has the same effect as the '-' flag: left-justification.

      similar to pre-extending an array by assigning a larger number to

      You can't shrink the number of buckets allocated for the hash using

    &quot;isa&quot; is also exportable and can be called as a sub with two

You may add other methods to the UNIVERSAL class via Perl or XS code. You do not

If perl is compiled with the malloc included with the perl distribution (that
  is, if &quot;perl -V:d_mymalloc&quot; is 'define') then you can print memory
  statistics at runtime by running Perl thusly:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  env PERL_DEBUG_MSTATS=2 perl your_script_here
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The value of 2 means to print statistics after compilation and on exit; with a
  value of 1, the statistics are printed only on exit. (If you want the
  statistics at an arbitrary time, you'll need to install the optional module
  Devel::Peek.)

  <dd class="It-tag">Perl memory allocation is by bucket with sizes close to
      powers of two. Because of these malloc overhead may be big, especially for
      data of size exactly a power of two. If &quot;PACK_MALLOC&quot; is

      (up to 64 bytes long), which makes it possible to have overhead down to 1
      byte for allocations which are powers of two (and appear quite often).
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Expected memory savings (with 8-byte alignment in &quot;alignbytes&quot;) is
      about 20% for typical Perl usage. Expected slowdown due to additional

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    On recent systems, the fact that perl requires 2M from system for 1M

      chunk is not going to be touched (and thus will not require real memory).
      However, it may result in a premature out-of-memory error. So if you will

<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Fcntl"><a class="selflink" href="#Fcntl">Fcntl</a></h2>
New constants in the existing Fcntl modules are now supported, provided that
  your operating system happens to support them:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    F_GETOWN F_SETOWN
    O_ASYNC O_DEFER O_DSYNC O_FSYNC O_SYNC
    O_EXLOCK O_SHLOCK
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
These constants are intended for use with the Perl operators <i>sysopen()</i>
  and <i>fcntl()</i> and the basic database modules like SDBM_File. For the
  exact meaning of these and other Fcntl constants please refer to your
  operating system's documentation for <i>fcntl()</i> and <i>open()</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In addition, the Fcntl module now provides these constants for use with the Perl
  operator <i>flock()</i>:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        LOCK_SH LOCK_EX LOCK_NB LOCK_UN
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
These constants are defined in all environments (because where there is no
  <i>flock()</i> system call, Perl emulates it). However, for historical
  reasons, these constants are not exported unless they are explicitly requested
  with the &quot;:flock&quot; tag (e.g. &quot;use Fcntl ':flock'&quot;).
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="IO"><a class="selflink" href="#IO">IO</a></h2>
The IO module provides a simple mechanism to load all the IO modules at one go.
  Currently this includes:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
     IO::Handle
     IO::Seekable
     IO::File
     IO::Pipe
     IO::Socket
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
For more information on any of these modules, please see its respective
  documentation.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Math::Complex"><a class="selflink" href="#Math::Complex">Math::Complex</a></h2>
The Math::Complex module has been totally rewritten, and now supports more
  operations. These are overloaded:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
     + - * / ** &lt;=&gt; neg ~ abs sqrt exp log sin cos atan2 &quot;&quot; (stringify)
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
And these functions are now exported:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    pi i Re Im arg
    log10 logn ln cbrt root
    tan
    csc sec cot
    asin acos atan
    acsc asec acot
    sinh cosh tanh
    csch sech coth
    asinh acosh atanh
    acsch asech acoth
    cplx cplxe
</pre>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Math::Trig"><a class="selflink" href="#Math::Trig">Math::Trig</a></h2>
This new module provides a simpler interface to parts of Math::Complex for those
  who need trigonometric functions only for real numbers.

<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="xsubpp"><a class="selflink" href="#xsubpp">xsubpp</a></h2>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&quot;void&quot; XSUBs now default to returning
    nothing</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Due to a documentation/implementation bug in previous
      versions of Perl, XSUBs with a return type of &quot;void&quot; have
      actually been returning one value. Usually that value was the GV for the
      XSUB, but sometimes it was some already freed or reused value, which would
      sometimes lead to program failure.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    In Perl 5.004, if an XSUB is declared as returning &quot;void&quot;, it
      actually returns no value, i.e. an empty list (though there is a
      backward-compatibility exception; see below). If your XSUB really does
      return an SV, you should give it a return type of &quot;SV *&quot;.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    For backward compatibility, <i>xsubpp</i> tries to guess whether a
      &quot;void&quot; XSUB is really &quot;void&quot; or if it wants to return
      an &quot;SV *&quot;. It does so by examining the text of the XSUB: if
      <i>xsubpp</i> finds what looks like an assignment to ST(0), it assumes
      that the XSUB's return type is really &quot;SV *&quot;.</dd>

    &quot;perl_call_sv&quot;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The &quot;gv_fetchmethod&quot; function finds a method for
      an object, just like in Perl 5.003. The GV it returns may be a method
      cache entry. However, in Perl 5.004, method cache entries are not visible
      to users; therefore, they can no longer be passed directly to
      &quot;perl_call_sv&quot;. Instead, you should use the &quot;GvCV&quot;
      macro on the GV to extract its CV, and pass the CV to
      &quot;perl_call_sv&quot;.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The most likely symptom of passing the result of &quot;gv_fetchmethod&quot;
      to &quot;perl_call_sv&quot; is Perl's producing an &quot;Undefined
      subroutine called&quot; error on the <i>second</i> call to a given method

  <dt class="It-tag">Extended API for manipulating hashes</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Internal handling of hash keys has changed. The old
      hashtable API is still fully supported, and will likely remain so. The
      additions to the API allow passing keys as &quot;SV*&quot;s, so that
      &quot;tied&quot; hashes can be given real scalars as keys rather than
      plain strings (nontied hashes still can only use strings as keys). New
      extensions must use the new hash access functions and macros if they wish
      to use &quot;SV*&quot; keys. These additions also make it feasible to
      manipulate &quot;HE*&quot;s (hash entries), which can be more efficient.

Several new conditions will trigger warnings that were silent before. Some only
  affect certain platforms. The following new warnings and errors outline these.
  These messages are classified as follows (listed in increasing order of
  desperation):
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   (W) A warning (optional).
   (D) A deprecation (optional).
   (S) A severe warning (mandatory).
   (F) A fatal error (trappable).
   (P) An internal error you should never see (trappable).
   (X) A very fatal error (nontrappable).
   (A) An alien error message (not generated by Perl).
</pre>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&quot;my&quot; variable %s masks earlier declaration in
    same scope</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">(W) A lexical variable has been redeclared in the same
      scope, effectively eliminating all access to the previous instance. This
      is almost always a typographical error. Note that the earlier variable
      will still exist until the end of the scope or until all closure referents
      to it are destroyed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">%s argument is not a HASH element or slice</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">(F) The argument to <i>delete()</i> must be either a hash

      then work on that scalar value. This is probably not what you meant to do.

      variables in config.sh: If you have tcsh, make the variables refer to it
      as if it were csh (e.g. &quot;full_csh='/usr/bin/tcsh'&quot;); otherwise,
      make them all empty (except that &quot;d_csh&quot; should be 'undef') so

    The request was judged to be small, so the possibility to trap it depends on
      the way Perl was compiled. By default it is not trappable. However, if
      compiled for this, Perl may use the contents of $^M as an emergency pool
      after <i>die()</i>ing with this message. In this case the error is
      trappable <i>once</i>.</dd>

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    However, the developers of Perl 5.004 could not fix this bug completely,
      because at least two widely-used modules depend on the old meaning of
      &quot;$$0&quot; in a string. So Perl 5.004 still interprets
      &quot;$$&lt;digit&gt;&quot; in the old (broken) way inside strings; but it
      generates this message as a warning. And in Perl 5.005, this special
      treatment will cease.</dd>

  <dt class="It-tag">Value of %s can be &quot;0&quot;; test with

  <dd class="It-tag">(W) In a conditional expression, you used &lt;HANDLE&gt;,
      &lt;*&gt; (glob), &quot;each()&quot;, or &quot;readdir()&quot; as a
      boolean value. Each of these constructs can return a value of
      &quot;0&quot;; that would make the conditional expression false, which is
      probably not what you intended. When using these constructs in conditional
      expressions, test their values with the &quot;defined&quot; operator.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">Variable &quot;%s&quot; may be unavailable</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">(W) An inner (nested) <i>anonymous</i> subroutine is inside
      a <i>named</i> subroutine, and outside that is another subroutine; and the
      anonymous (innermost) subroutine is referencing a lexical variable defined
      in the outermost subroutine. For example:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
   sub outermost { my $a; sub middle { sub { $a } } }
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If the anonymous subroutine is called or referenced (directly or indirectly)
      from the outermost subroutine, it will share the variable as you would
      expect. But if the anonymous subroutine is called or referenced when the
      outermost subroutine is not active, it will see the value of the shared
      variable as it was before and during the *first* call to the outermost
      subroutine, which is probably not what you want.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    In these circumstances, it is usually best to make the middle subroutine
      anonymous, using the &quot;sub {}&quot; syntax. Perl has specific support
      for shared variables in nested anonymous subroutines; a named subroutine
      in between interferes with this feature.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">Variable &quot;%s&quot; will not stay shared</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">(W) An inner (nested) <i>named</i> subroutine is
      referencing a lexical variable defined in an outer subroutine.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    When the inner subroutine is called, it will probably see the value of the
      outer subroutine's variable as it was before and during the *first* call
      to the outer subroutine; in this case, after the first call to the outer
      subroutine is complete, the inner and outer subroutines will no longer
      share a common value for the variable. In other words, the variable will
      no longer be shared.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Furthermore, if the outer subroutine is anonymous and references a lexical
      variable outside itself, then the outer and inner subroutines will
      <i>never</i> share the given variable.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This problem can usually be solved by making the inner subroutine anonymous,
      using the &quot;sub {}&quot; syntax. When inner anonymous subs that
      reference variables in outer subroutines are called or referenced, they
      are automatically rebound to the current values of such variables.</dd>
