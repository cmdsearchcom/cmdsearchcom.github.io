perlwin32 - Perl under Windows
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
These are instructions for building Perl under Windows 2000 and later.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
Before you start, you should glance through the README file found in the
  top-level directory to which the Perl distribution was extracted. Make sure
  you read and understand the terms under which this software is being
  distributed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Also make sure you read &quot;BUGS AND CAVEATS&quot; below for the known
  limitations of this port.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The INSTALL file in the perl top-level has much information that is only
  relevant to people building Perl on Unix-like systems. In particular, you can
  safely ignore any information that talks about &quot;Configure&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You may also want to look at one other option for building a perl that will work
  on Windows: the README.cygwin file, which give a different set of rules to
  build a perl for Windows. This method will probably enable you to build a more
  Unix-compatible perl, but you will also need to download and use various other
  build-time and run-time support software described in that file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This set of instructions is meant to describe a so-called &quot;native&quot;
  port of Perl to the Windows platform. This includes both 32-bit and 64-bit
  Windows operating systems. The resulting Perl requires no additional software
  to run (other than what came with your operating system). Currently, this port
  is capable of using one of the following compilers on the Intel x86
  architecture:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
      Microsoft Visual C++    version 6.0 or later
      Gcc by mingw.org        gcc version 3.2 or later
      Gcc by mingw-w64.sf.net gcc version 4.4.3 or later
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that the last two of these are actually competing projects both delivering
  complete gcc toolchain for MS Windows:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&lt;http://mingw.org&gt;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Delivers gcc toolchain targeting 32-bit Windows
    platform.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">http://mingw-w64.sf.net
    &lt;http://mingw-w64.sf.net&gt;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Delivers gcc toolchain targeting both 64-bit Windows and
      32-bit Windows platforms (despite the project name &quot;mingw-w64&quot;
      they are not only 64-bit oriented). They deliver the native gcc compilers
      and cross-compilers that are also supported by perl's makefile.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The Microsoft Visual C++ compilers are also now being given away free. They are
  available as &quot;Visual C++ Toolkit 2003&quot; or &quot;Visual C++
  2005/2008/2010 Express Edition&quot; (and also as part of the &quot;.NET
  Framework SDK&quot;) and are the same compilers that ship with &quot;Visual
  C++ .NET 2003 Professional&quot; or &quot;Visual C++ 2005/2008/2010
  Professional&quot; respectively.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This port can also be built on IA64/AMD64 using:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
      Microsoft Platform SDK    Nov 2001 (64-bit compiler and tools)
      MinGW64 compiler (gcc version 4.4.3 or later)
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The Windows SDK can be downloaded from &lt;http://www.microsoft.com/&gt;. The
  MinGW64 compiler is available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64
  &lt;http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64&gt;. The latter is actually a
  cross-compiler targeting Win64. There's also a trimmed down compiler (no java,
  or gfortran) suitable for building perl available at:
  &lt;http://strawberryperl.com/package/kmx/64_gcctoolchain/&gt;
<div class="Pp"></div>
NOTE: If you're using a 32-bit compiler to build perl on a 64-bit Windows
  operating system, then you should set the WIN64 environment variable to
  &quot;undef&quot;. Also, the trimmed down compiler only passes tests when
  USE_ITHREADS *= define (as opposed to undef) and when the CFG *= Debug line is
  commented out.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This port fully supports MakeMaker (the set of modules that is used to build
  extensions to perl). Therefore, you should be able to build and install most
  extensions found in the CPAN sites. See &quot;Usage Hints for Perl on
  Windows&quot; below for general hints about this.

  <dt class="It-tag">Make</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">You need a &quot;make&quot; program to build the sources.
      If you are using Visual C++ or the Windows SDK tools, nmake will work.
      Builds using the gcc need dmake.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    dmake is a freely available make that has very nice macro features and
      parallelability.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    A port of dmake for Windows is available from:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">Command Shell</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Use the default &quot;cmd&quot; shell that comes with
      Windows. Some versions of the popular 4DOS/NT shell have incompatibilities
      that may cause you trouble. If the build fails under that shell, try
      building again with the cmd shell.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Make sure the path to the build directory does not contain spaces. The build
      usually works in this circumstance, but some tests will fail.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">Microsoft Visual C++</dt>

      somewhere like C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\VC98\Bin. This
      will set your build environment.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    You can also use dmake to build using Visual C++; provided, however, you set
      OSRELEASE to &quot;microsft&quot; (or whatever the directory name under
      which the Visual C dmake configuration lives) in your environment and edit
      win32/config.vc to change &quot;make=nmake&quot; into

If you are running the tests from a emacs shell window, you may see failures in
  op/stat.t. Run &quot;dmake test-notty&quot; in that case.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you run the tests on a FAT partition, you may see some failures for
  &quot;link()&quot; related tests ( <i>op/write.t</i>, <i>op/stat.t</i> ...).
  Testing on NTFS avoids these errors.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Furthermore, you should make sure that during &quot;make test&quot; you do not
  have any GNU tool packages in your path: some toolkits like Unixutils include
  some tools (&quot;type&quot; for instance) which override the Windows ones and
  makes tests fail. Remove them from your path while testing to avoid these

Type &quot;dmake install&quot; (or &quot;nmake install&quot;). This will put the
  newly built perl and the libraries under whatever &quot;INST_TOP&quot; points
  to in the Makefile. It will also install the pod documentation under
  &quot;$INST_TOP\$INST_VER\lib\pod&quot; and HTML versions of the same under
  &quot;$INST_TOP\$INST_VER\lib\pod\html&quot;.

To use the Perl you just installed you will need to add a new entry to your PATH

If you opted to uncomment &quot;INST_VER&quot; and &quot;INST_ARCH&quot; in the

  will need to add two new PATH components instead:
  &quot;$INST_TOP\$INST_VER\bin&quot; and
  &quot;$INST_TOP\$INST_VER\bin\$ARCHNAME&quot;, e.g.
<div class="Pp"></div>

    Perl does not depend on the registry, but it can look up certain default

      &quot;HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Perl&quot; and
      &quot;HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Perl&quot;. Entries in the former
      override entries in the latter. One or more of the following entries (of

  <dt class="It-tag">Using perl from the command line</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If you are accustomed to using perl from various
      command-line shells found in UNIX environments, you will be less than
      pleased with what Windows offers by way of a command shell.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The crucial thing to understand about the Windows environment is that the
      command line you type in is processed twice before Perl sees it. First,
      your command shell (usually CMD.EXE) preprocesses the command line, to
      handle redirection, environment variable expansion, and location of the
      executable to run. Then, the perl executable splits the remaining command
      line into individual arguments, using the C runtime library upon which
      Perl was built.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    It is particularly important to note that neither the shell nor the C
      runtime do any wildcard expansions of command-line arguments (so wildcards
      need not be quoted). Also, the quoting behaviours of the shell and the C
      runtime are rudimentary at best (and may, if you are using a non-standard
      shell, be inconsistent). The only (useful) quote character is the double
      quote (&quot;). It can be used to protect spaces and other special
      characters in arguments.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The Windows documentation describes the shell parsing rules here:
      http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/cmd.mspx?mfr=true
      &lt;http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/cmd.mspx?mfr=true&gt;
      and the C runtime parsing rules here:
      http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/17w5ykft%28v=VS.100%29.aspx
      &lt;http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/17w5ykft%28v=VS.100%29.aspx&gt;.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Here are some further observations based on experiments: The C runtime
      breaks arguments at spaces and passes them to programs in argc/argv.
      Double quotes can be used to prevent arguments with spaces in them from
      being split up. You can put a double quote in an argument by escaping it
      with a backslash and enclosing the whole argument within double quotes.
      The backslash and the pair of double quotes surrounding the argument will
      be stripped by the C runtime.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The file redirection characters &quot;&lt;&quot;, &quot;&gt;&quot;, and
      &quot;|&quot; can be quoted by double quotes (although there are
      suggestions that this may not always be true). Single quotes are not
      treated as quotes by the shell or the C runtime, they don't get stripped
      by the shell (just to make this type of quoting completely useless). The
      caret &quot;^&quot; has also been observed to behave as a quoting
      character, but this appears to be a shell feature, and the caret is not
      stripped from the command line, so Perl still sees it (and the C runtime
      phase does not treat the caret as a quote character).
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Here are some examples of usage of the &quot;cmd&quot; shell:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This prints two doublequotes:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    perl -e &quot;print '\&quot;\&quot;' &quot;
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This does the same:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    perl -e &quot;print \&quot;\\\&quot;\\\&quot;\&quot; &quot;
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This prints &quot;bar&quot; and writes &quot;foo&quot; to the file
      &quot;blurch&quot;:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    perl -e &quot;print 'foo'; print STDERR 'bar'&quot; &gt; blurch
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This prints &quot;foo&quot; (&quot;bar&quot; disappears into nowhereland):
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    perl -e &quot;print 'foo'; print STDERR 'bar'&quot; 2&gt; nul
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This prints &quot;bar&quot; and writes &quot;foo&quot; into the file
      &quot;blurch&quot;:

    <pre>
    perl -e &quot;print 'foo'; print STDERR 'bar'&quot; 1&gt; blurch
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This pipes &quot;foo&quot; to the &quot;less&quot; pager and prints
      &quot;bar&quot; on the console:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    perl -e &quot;print 'foo'; print STDERR 'bar'&quot; | less
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This pipes &quot;foo\nbar\n&quot; to the less pager:

    <pre>
    perl -le &quot;print 'foo'; print STDERR 'bar'&quot; 2&gt;&amp;1 | less
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This pipes &quot;foo&quot; to the pager and writes &quot;bar&quot; in the
      file &quot;blurch&quot;:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    perl -e &quot;print 'foo'; print STDERR 'bar'&quot; 2&gt; blurch | less

    Discovering the usefulness of the &quot;command.com&quot; shell on Windows
      9x is left as an exercise to the reader :)
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    One particularly pernicious problem with the 4NT command shell for Windows
      is that it (nearly) always treats a % character as indicating that
      environment variable expansion is needed. Under this shell, it is
      therefore important to always double any % characters which you want Perl
      to see (for example, for hash variables), even when they are quoted.</dd>

  <dt class="It-tag">Building Extensions</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The Comprehensive Perl Archive Network (CPAN) offers a
      wealth of extensions, some of which require a C compiler to build. Look in
      &lt;http://www.cpan.org/&gt; for more information on CPAN.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Note that not all of the extensions available from CPAN may work in the
      Windows environment; you should check the information at
      &lt;http://testers.cpan.org/&gt; before investing too much effort into
      porting modules that don't readily build.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Most extensions (whether they require a C compiler or not) can be built,
      tested and installed with the standard mantra:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    perl Makefile.PL
    $MAKE
    $MAKE test
    $MAKE install
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    where $MAKE is whatever 'make' program you have configured perl to use. Use
      &quot;perl -V:make&quot; to find out what this is. Some extensions may not
      provide a testsuite (so &quot;$MAKE test&quot; may not do anything or
      fail), but most serious ones do.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    It is important that you use a supported 'make' program, and ensure
      Config.pm knows about it. If you don't have nmake, you can either get
      dmake from the location mentioned earlier or get an old version of nmake
      reportedly available from:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    http://download.microsoft.com/download/vc15/Patch/1.52/W95/EN-US/nmake15.exe
      &lt;http://download.microsoft.com/download/vc15/Patch/1.52/W95/EN-US/nmake15.exe&gt;
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Another option is to use the make written in Perl, available from CPAN.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/Make/
      &lt;http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/Make/&gt;
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    You may also use dmake. See &quot;Make&quot; above on how to get it.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Note that MakeMaker actually emits makefiles with different syntax depending
      on what 'make' it thinks you are using. Therefore, it is important that
      one of the following values appears in Config.pm:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    make='nmake'        # MakeMaker emits nmake syntax
    make='dmake'        # MakeMaker emits dmake syntax
    any other value     # MakeMaker emits generic make syntax
                            (e.g GNU make, or Perl make)
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If the value doesn't match the 'make' program you want to use, edit
      Config.pm to fix it.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If a module implements XSUBs, you will need one of the supported C
      compilers. You must make sure you have set up the environment for the
      compiler for command-line compilation.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If a module does not build for some reason, look carefully for why it
      failed, and report problems to the module author. If it looks like the
      extension building support is at fault, report that with full details of
      how the build failed using the perlbug utility.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">Command-line Wildcard Expansion</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The default command shells on DOS descendant operating
      systems (such as they are) usually do not expand wildcard arguments
      supplied to programs. They consider it the application's job to handle
      that. This is commonly achieved by linking the application (in our case,
      perl) with startup code that the C runtime libraries usually provide.
      However, doing that results in incompatible perl versions (since the
      behavior of the argv expansion code differs depending on the compiler, and
      it is even buggy on some compilers). Besides, it may be a source of
      frustration if you use such a perl binary with an alternate shell that
      *does* expand wildcards.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Instead, the following solution works rather well. The nice things about it
      are 1) you can start using it right away; 2) it is more powerful, because
      it will do the right thing with a pattern like */*/*.c; 3) you can decide
      whether you do/don't want to use it; and 4) you can extend the method to
      add any customizations (or even entirely different kinds of wildcard
      expansion).
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
        C:\&gt; copy con c:\perl\lib\Wild.pm
        # Wild.pm - emulate shell @ARGV expansion on shells that don't
        use File::DosGlob;
        @ARGV = map {
                      my @g = File::DosGlob::glob($_) if /[*?]/;
                      @g ? @g : $_;
                    } @ARGV;
        1;
        ^Z
        C:\&gt; set PERL5OPT=-MWild
        C:\&gt; perl -le &quot;for (@ARGV) { print }&quot; */*/perl*.c
        p4view/perl/perl.c
        p4view/perl/perlio.c
        p4view/perl/perly.c
        perl5.005/win32/perlglob.c
        perl5.005/win32/perllib.c
        perl5.005/win32/perlglob.c
        perl5.005/win32/perllib.c
        perl5.005/win32/perlglob.c
        perl5.005/win32/perllib.c
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Note there are two distinct steps there: 1) You'll have to create Wild.pm
      and put it in your perl lib directory. 2) You'll need to set the PERL5OPT
      environment variable. If you want argv expansion to be the default, just
      set PERL5OPT in your default startup environment.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If you are using the Visual C compiler, you can get the C runtime's command
      line wildcard expansion built into perl binary. The resulting binary will
      always expand unquoted command lines, which may not be what you want if
      you use a shell that does that for you. The expansion done is also
      somewhat less powerful than the approach suggested above.</dd>

Perl scripts on UNIX use the &quot;#!&quot; (a.k.a &quot;shebang&quot;) line to
  indicate to the OS that it should execute the file using perl. Windows has no
  comparable means to indicate arbitrary files are executables.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Instead, all available methods to execute plain text files on Windows rely on
  the file &quot;extension&quot;. There are three methods to use this to execute
  perl scripts:
<dl class="Bl-tag">

  <dd class="It-tag">Since file associations don't work everywhere, and there
      are reportedly bugs with file associations where it does work, the old
      method of wrapping the perl script to make it look like a regular batch
      file to the OS, may be used. The install process makes available the
      &quot;pl2bat.bat&quot; script which can be used to wrap perl scripts into
      batch files. For example:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
        pl2bat foo.pl
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>

      run properly; running &quot;pl2bat&quot; replicates the contents of the
      original script, and so this process can be maintenance intensive if the
      originals get updated often. A different approach that avoids both
      problems is possible.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    A script called &quot;runperl.bat&quot; is available that can be copied to
      any filename (along with the .bat suffix). For example, if you call it
      &quot;foo.bat&quot;, it will run the file &quot;foo&quot; when it is
      executed. Since you can run batch files on Windows platforms simply by
      typing the name (without the extension), this effectively runs the file
      &quot;foo&quot;, when you type either &quot;foo&quot; or
      &quot;foo.bat&quot;. With this method, &quot;foo.bat&quot; can even be in
      a different location than the file &quot;foo&quot;, as long as
      &quot;foo&quot; is available somewhere on the PATH. If your scripts are on
      a filesystem that allows symbolic links, you can even avoid copying
      &quot;runperl.bat&quot;.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Here's a diversion: copy &quot;runperl.bat&quot; to &quot;runperl&quot;, and
      type &quot;runperl&quot;. Explain the observed behavior, or lack thereof.

A full set of HTML documentation is installed, so you should be able to use it
  if you have a web browser installed on your system.
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;perldoc&quot; is also a useful tool for browsing information contained in
  the documentation, especially in conjunction with a pager like
  &quot;less&quot; (recent versions of which have Windows support). You may have
  to set the PAGER environment variable to use a specific pager. &quot;perldoc
  -f foo&quot; will print information about the perl operator &quot;foo&quot;.

One common mistake when using this port with a GUI library like &quot;Tk&quot;
  is assuming that Perl's normal behavior of opening a command-line window will
  go away. This isn't the case. If you want to start a copy of &quot;perl&quot;
  without opening a command-line window, use the &quot;wperl&quot; executable
  built during the installation process. Usage is exactly the same as normal
  &quot;perl&quot; on Windows, except that options like &quot;-h&quot; don't
  work (since they need a command-line window to print to).
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you find bugs in perl, you can run &quot;perlbug&quot; to create a bug report
  (you may have to send it manually if &quot;perlbug&quot; cannot find a mailer
  on your system).

Norton AntiVirus interferes with the build process, particularly if set to
  &quot;AutoProtect, All Files, when Opened&quot;. Unlike large applications the
  perl build process opens and modifies a lot of files. Having the the AntiVirus
  scan each and every one slows build the process significantly. Worse, with
  PERLIO=stdio the build process fails with peculiar messages as the virus
  checker interacts badly with miniperl.exe writing configure files (it seems to
  either catch file part written and treat it as suspicious, or virus checker
  may have it &quot;locked&quot; in a way which inhibits miniperl updating it).
  The build does complete with
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   set PERLIO=perlio
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
but that may be just luck. Other AntiVirus software may have similar issues.

Some of the built-in functions do not act exactly as documented in perlfunc, and
  a few are not implemented at all. To avoid surprises, particularly if you have
  had prior exposure to Perl in other operating environments or if you intend to
  write code that will be portable to other environments, see perlport for a
  reasonably definitive list of these differences.

Not all extensions available from CPAN may build or work properly in the Windows
  environment. See &quot;Building Extensions&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Most &quot;socket()&quot; related calls are supported, but they may not behave
  as on Unix platforms. See perlport for the full list.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Signal handling may not behave as on Unix platforms (where it doesn't exactly
  &quot;behave&quot;, either :). For instance, calling &quot;die()&quot; or
  &quot;exit()&quot; from signal handlers will cause an exception, since most
  implementations of &quot;signal()&quot; on Windows are severely crippled.
  Thus, signals may work only for simple things like setting a flag variable in
  the handler. Using signals under this port should currently be considered
  unsupported.
