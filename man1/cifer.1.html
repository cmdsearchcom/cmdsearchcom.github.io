<p>CIFER(1) General Commands Manual CIFER(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
cifer - multipurpose classical cryptanalysis and
code&acirc;breaking tool</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
cifer [-finqs] [command]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Cifer provides many functions designed to aid in cracking
classical ciphers; a group of ciphers used historically, but
which have now fallen into disuse because of their
sucept&acirc; <br>
ability to ciphertext&acirc;only attacks. In general, they
were designed and implemented by hand, and operate on an
alphabet of letters (such as [A&acirc;Z]).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cifer is implemented as an
interactive shell, with support for scripting. All of its
commands are documented via the usage command. For instance,
type usage load_dict for infor&acirc; <br>
mation on the load_dict command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Buffers and Filters <br>
The shell uses the concept of a buffer to store a string of
text, which most comands read from as input, and write to as
output. Unless run with the -n option, cifer will
auto&acirc; <br>
matically create 10 buffers at startup. Buffers are referred
to in the form, buffer_#, where # is substituted with the
buffer&rsquo;s index number. For more information on
buffers, <br>
see the usage for: buffers, resize, clear, copy, load,
write, read, bufferinfo, and nullbuffer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Filters can be used to
manipulate the set of characters in a buffer, for example
making all characters uppercase, or removing all whitespace.
For more information on filters, see <br>
the usage of filter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Dictionaries <br>
Some of cifer&rsquo;s functions require a specially
formatted &rsquo;dictionary&rsquo;, which takes the basic
form of a list of words. The utility cifer-dict(1) can be
used to create these dictio&acirc; <br>
naries. The loaddict command is used to load a dictionary
for use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Frequency Analysis <br>
Frequency analysis is the study of the frequency of symbols,
or groups of symbols in a ciphertext. It aids in cracking
monoalphabetic substition schemes. Frequency analysis <br>
works upon the principle that, in any given sample of
written language, certain characters and groups of
characters will occur more often than others. Furthermore,
the distribu&acirc; <br>
tion of those frequencies will be roughly the same for all
samples of that written language. For instance, in any
section of English language, the character &rsquo;E&rsquo;
appears far more <br>
often than &rsquo;X&rsquo;. Likewise, the pair of letters
&rsquo;TH&rsquo; is very common, whilst &rsquo;XY&rsquo; is
very rare. In monoalphabetic substitution schemes, these
patterns are preserved and it is pos&acirc; <br>
sible to determine certain mapppings of letters from
ciphertext&acirc;&gt;plaintext from the frequencies alone.
As more and more characters are converted, it becomes easy
to guess the <br>
remaining ones to form words in the target language.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perhaps the most tedious part of
this method is the actual counting of the symbols
themselves. Thus, Cifer provides functions to count
characters, digrams (pairs of characters), <br>
and trigrams (triplets of characters). It can also use
frequency analyis to guess ciphertext&acirc;&gt;plaintext
mappings for the English language. For more information, see
the usage <br>
for: frequency_guesses, identity_frequency_graph,
frequency_analysis, count_digrams, and count_trigrams.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Affine Ciphers <br>
An affine cipher is a type of monoalphabetic substitution
cipher. In order to implement an affine cipher, one would
assign each character of the chosen alphabet a number, for
<br>
example, a = 0; b = 1; c = 2; etc. Then for each letter of
the plaintext, put it through the encryption function:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">e(x) = (ax + b) (mod m)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Where x is the plaintext
character&rsquo;s assigned number, a and m are coprime and m
is the size of the alphabet. The ciphertext character for
this plaintext character is the charac&acirc; <br>
ter assigned to the number e(x).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cifer provides functions to both
encrypt and decrypt affine ciphers as well as crack affine
ciphers using frequency analysis or brute force. Note that
cifer is currently only <br>
able to deal with affine ciphers where m = 26. For more
information, see the usage for: affinesolve, affinebf,
affineencode, affinedecode, and mmi.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Vigenere Ciphers <br>
The Vigenere cipher is a form of polyalphabetic substitution
consisting of several Caesar ciphers in sequence with
differing shift values, which vary according to a repeating
<br>
keyword. Cifer provides the function vigenere_crack, which
employs a brute&acirc;force (for each possible keyword
length) frequency analysis method in order to find the
keyword, and <br>
crack the cipher.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Keyword Ciphers <br>
A keyword cipher is a type of monoalphabetic substitution in
which the mapping of plaintext characters to ciphertext
characters is affected by the inclusion of a
&rsquo;keyword&rsquo;. Cifer <br>
provides the function keyword_bruteforce which attempts to
find the correct keyword by going through a
&rsquo;dictionary&rsquo; of possible words and trying each
one in turn, then selecting <br>
the best solution by matching words in the solution to those
in the dictionary. If the keyword to a ciphertext is already
known, it can be decoded using the keyword_decode com&acirc;
<br>
mand.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bacon Ciphers <br>
A bacon cipher is a method of stenography, in which a
message is concealed in the presentation of text, rather
than its content. The ciphertext consists of any message
(again, <br>
the language has no impact on the concealed plaintext) in
which each character can be categorised into one of two
distinct groups, we call these &rsquo;A&rsquo; and
&rsquo;B&rsquo;. This distinction may <br>
be made in any number of predetermined ways, such as two
typefaces, or other indicators. In order to decode the
cipher one replaces groups of 5 As and Bs with their
corresponding <br>
plaintext character, as dictated by the Baconian alphabet
(however, be aware that it would be trivial for the two
communicating parties to create their own
&rsquo;custom&rsquo; version of <br>
the Baconian alphabet). To encode a plaintext, the reverse
operation is performed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A Bacon cipher can be easily
encoded/decoded, and cifer provides the functions
bacon_encode and bacon_decode to achieve this. They use a
buffer of As and Bs as input and output, <br>
and thus any ciphertext that needs to be decoded must first
be turned into As and Bs. Before the plaintext is loaded, it
should be modified so that upper and lower case
charac&acirc; <br>
ters belong to the A and B groups, respectively. Then, the
casebacon filter can be applied to convert the upper and
lower case characters in the buffer to As and Bs. There is
<br>
also a bacon filter, which removes all characters which are
not &rsquo;A&rsquo; or &rsquo;B&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Rail Fence Ciphers <br>
The rail fence cipher is a form of transposition cipher,
which gets its name from the way the plaintext is written
alternatively downwards and upwards diagonally on
&rsquo;rails&rsquo;, <br>
before being read off as the ciphertext in rows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cifer provides the function rfbf
to crack rail fence ciphers using a brute force method and
checking for solutions using a dictionary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Columnar Transposition <br>
Columnar transposition is a relatively complex form of
cipher, with many variants. The basic process of encoding
using this method involves first writing the plaintext out
in a <br>
table defined by its width (which is also the length of the
keyword). Then, depending on the variant, the ciphertext is
written and read out of the table in any number of
differ&acirc; <br>
ent ways.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The keyword can be specified in
numeric or alphabetic form. In the former, each digit must
only be used once and there must be enough digits to form a
full key (ie. for a key <br>
length 4, all the digits [0,1,2,3] must be used). An
alphabetic keyword, such as &rsquo;apple&rsquo;, first has
duplicate letters removed. This gives us &rsquo;aple&rsquo;.
If you were encrypting by <br>
hand, you would write out &rsquo;aple&rsquo; at the top of
your table, and them move the columns around until the
keyword is in alphabetic order, ie. &rsquo;aelp&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to decrypt a
ciphertext, we first &rsquo;flip&rsquo; the keyword, turning
&rsquo;aelp&rsquo; into &rsquo;plea&rsquo;. We can then use
this keyword as if we were encrypting, and the process will
reverse the <br>
original function to give us the plaintext.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cifer&rsquo;s keyword functions
provide utilities to automate many variants. There are nine
commands: c2c_encode, c2c_decode, c2c_bruteforce,
r2c_encode, r2c_decode, r2c_bruteforce, <br>
c2r_encode, c2r_decode and c2r_bruteforce.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first three letters of each
command are short for: &rsquo;column to column&rsquo;,
&Acirc;&acute;column to row&rsquo; and &rsquo;row to
column&rsquo;; these refer to different ways in which the
ciphertext can be read <br>
off the table. In c2c, the table is written from left to
right, re&acirc;ordered and read off left to right again. In
r2c, the table is written from top to bottom,
re&acirc;ordered and then <br>
read off from left to right. Finally, in c2r the table is
written left to right, re&acirc;ordered and read off from
top to bottom.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&acute;Encode&rsquo; and
&rsquo;decode&rsquo; mode both take a keyword and work as
one would expect. In &rsquo;bruteforce&rsquo; mode, cifer
tries all permutations of increasing key lengths in an
attempt to find <br>
the real keyword. It tests possible solutions by matching
words in the dictionary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-n Disable auto-init.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Execute the commands in the
(script) file specified, then exit</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i Execute the script file and
then go to interactive mode</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Do not fully parse file
before execution</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Exit on soft-fails, not just
hard-fails (for script execution)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any text found after the options
will be interpreted as a command to the shell; Please note
that you cannot specify a command if either -i or -f are
used, and that -q and -s only <br>
apply to -f or -i.</p>
