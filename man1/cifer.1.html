cifer - multipurpose classical cryptanalysis and code&#x2010;breaking tool
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<b>cifer</b> [-finqs] [command]
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>Cifer</b> provides many functions designed to aid in cracking classical
  ciphers; a group of ciphers used historically, but which have now fallen into
  disuse because of their suceptability to ciphertext&#x2010;only attacks. In
  general, they were designed and implemented by hand, and operate on an
  alphabet of letters (such as [A&#x2010;Z]).
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Cifer</b> is implemented as an interactive shell, with support for scripting.
  All of its commands are documented via the <b>usage</b> command. For instance,
  type <b>usage load_dict</b> for information on the <b>load_dict</b> command.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Buffers_and_Filters"><a class="selflink" href="#Buffers_and_Filters">Buffers
  and Filters</a></h2>
The shell uses the concept of a <b>buffer</b> to store a string of text, which
  most comands read from as input, and write to as output. Unless run with the
  <b>-n</b> option, <b>cifer</b> will automatically create 10 buffers at
  startup. Buffers are referred to in the form, <b>buffer_#</b>, where <b>#</b>
  is substituted with the buffer's index number. For more information on
  buffers, see the <b>usage</b> for: <b>buffers</b>, <b>resize</b>,
  <b>clear</b>, <b>copy</b>, <b>load</b>, <b>write</b>, <b>read</b>,
  <b>bufferinfo</b>, and <b>nullbuffer</b>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Filters can be used to manipulate the set of characters in a buffer, for example
  making all characters uppercase, or removing all whitespace. For more
  information on filters, see the <b>usage</b> of <b>filter</b>.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Dictionaries"><a class="selflink" href="#Dictionaries">Dictionaries</a></h2>
Some of <b>cifer</b>'s functions require a specially formatted 'dictionary',
  which takes the basic form of a list of words. The utility
  <b>cifer-dict</b>(1) can be used to create these dictionaries. The
  <b>loaddict</b> command is used to load a dictionary for use.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Frequency_Analysis"><a class="selflink" href="#Frequency_Analysis">Frequency
  Analysis</a></h2>
Frequency analysis is the study of the frequency of symbols, or groups of
  symbols in a ciphertext. It aids in cracking monoalphabetic substition
  schemes. Frequency analysis works upon the principle that, in any given sample
  of written language, certain characters and groups of characters will occur
  more often than others. Furthermore, the distribution of those frequencies
  will be roughly the same for all samples of that written language. For
  instance, in any section of English language, the character 'E' appears far
  more often than 'X'. Likewise, the pair of letters 'TH' is very common, whilst
  'XY' is very rare. In monoalphabetic substitution schemes, these patterns are
  preserved and it is possible to determine certain mapppings of letters from
  ciphertext&#x2010;&gt;plaintext from the frequencies alone. As more and more
  characters are converted, it becomes easy to guess the remaining ones to form
  words in the target language.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Perhaps the most tedious part of this method is the actual counting of the
  symbols themselves. Thus, <b>Cifer</b> provides functions to count characters,
  digrams (pairs of characters), and trigrams (triplets of characters). It can
  also use frequency analyis to guess ciphertext&#x2010;&gt;plaintext mappings
  for the English language. For more information, see the <b>usage</b> for:
  <b>frequency_guesses</b>, <b>identity_frequency_graph</b>,
  <b>frequency_analysis</b>, <b>count_digrams</b>, and <b>count_trigrams</b>.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Affine_Ciphers"><a class="selflink" href="#Affine_Ciphers">Affine
  Ciphers</a></h2>
An affine cipher is a type of monoalphabetic substitution cipher. In order to
  implement an affine cipher, one would assign each character of the chosen
  alphabet a number, for example, a = 0; b = 1; c = 2; etc. Then for each letter
  of the plaintext, put it through the encryption function:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>e(x) = (ax + b) (mod m)</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Where <b>x</b> is the plaintext character's assigned number, <b>a</b> and
  <b>m</b> are coprime and <b>m</b> is the size of the alphabet. The ciphertext
  character for this plaintext character is the character assigned to the number
  <b>e(x)</b>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Cifer provides functions to both encrypt and decrypt affine ciphers as well as
  crack affine ciphers using frequency analysis or brute force. Note that cifer
  is currently only able to deal with affine ciphers where <b>m = 26</b>. For
  more information, see the <b>usage</b> for: <b>affinesolve</b>,
  <b>affinebf</b>, <b>affineencode</b>, <b>affinedecode</b>, and <b>mmi</b>.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Vigenere_Ciphers"><a class="selflink" href="#Vigenere_Ciphers">Vigenere
  Ciphers</a></h2>
The Vigenere cipher is a form of polyalphabetic substitution consisting of
  several Caesar ciphers in sequence with differing shift values, which vary
  according to a repeating keyword. <b>Cifer</b> provides the function
  <b>vigenere_crack</b>, which employs a brute&#x2010;force (for each possible
  keyword length) frequency analysis method in order to find the keyword, and
  crack the cipher.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Keyword_Ciphers"><a class="selflink" href="#Keyword_Ciphers">Keyword
  Ciphers</a></h2>
A keyword cipher is a type of monoalphabetic substitution in which the mapping
  of plaintext characters to ciphertext characters is affected by the inclusion
  of a 'keyword'. <b>Cifer</b> provides the function <b>keyword_bruteforce</b>
  which attempts to find the correct keyword by going through a 'dictionary' of
  possible words and trying each one in turn, then selecting the best solution
  by matching words in the solution to those in the dictionary. If the keyword
  to a ciphertext is already known, it can be decoded using the
  <b>keyword_decode</b> command.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Bacon_Ciphers"><a class="selflink" href="#Bacon_Ciphers">Bacon
  Ciphers</a></h2>
A bacon cipher is a method of stenography, in which a message is concealed in
  the presentation of text, rather than its content. The ciphertext consists of
  any message (again, the language has no impact on the concealed plaintext) in
  which each character can be categorised into one of two distinct groups, we
  call these 'A' and 'B'. This distinction may be made in any number of
  predetermined ways, such as two typefaces, or other indicators. In order to
  decode the cipher one replaces groups of 5 As and Bs with their corresponding
  plaintext character, as dictated by the Baconian alphabet (however, be aware
  that it would be trivial for the two communicating parties to create their own
  'custom' version of the Baconian alphabet). To encode a plaintext, the reverse
  operation is performed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A Bacon cipher can be easily encoded/decoded, and <b>cifer</b> provides the
  functions <b>bacon_encode</b> and <b>bacon_decode</b> to achieve this. They
  use a buffer of As and Bs as input and output, and thus any ciphertext that
  needs to be decoded must first be turned into As and Bs. Before the plaintext
  is loaded, it should be modified so that upper and lower case characters
  belong to the A and B groups, respectively. Then, the <b>casebacon</b> filter
  can be applied to convert the upper and lower case characters in the buffer to
  As and Bs. There is also a <b>bacon</b> filter, which removes all characters
  which are not 'A' or 'B'.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Rail_Fence_Ciphers"><a class="selflink" href="#Rail_Fence_Ciphers">Rail
  Fence Ciphers</a></h2>
The rail fence cipher is a form of transposition cipher, which gets its name
  from the way the plaintext is written alternatively downwards and upwards
  diagonally on 'rails', before being read off as the ciphertext in rows.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Cifer</b> provides the function <b>rfbf</b> to crack rail fence ciphers using
  a brute force method and checking for solutions using a dictionary.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Columnar_Transposition"><a class="selflink" href="#Columnar_Transposition">Columnar
  Transposition</a></h2>
Columnar transposition is a relatively complex form of cipher, with many
  variants. The basic process of encoding using this method involves first
  writing the plaintext out in a table defined by its width (which is also the
  length of the keyword). Then, depending on the variant, the ciphertext is
  written and read out of the table in any number of different ways.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The keyword can be specified in numeric or alphabetic form. In the former, each
  digit must only be used once and there must be enough digits to form a full
  key (ie. for a key length 4, all the digits [0,1,2,3] must be used). An
  alphabetic keyword, such as 'apple', first has duplicate letters removed. This
  gives us 'aple'. If you were encrypting by hand, you would write out 'aple' at
  the top of your table, and them move the columns around until the keyword is
  in alphabetic order, ie. 'aelp'.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In order to decrypt a ciphertext, we first 'flip' the keyword, turning 'aelp'
  into 'plea'. We can then use this keyword as if we were encrypting, and the
  process will reverse the original function to give us the plaintext.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Cifer</b>'s keyword functions provide utilities to automate many variants.
  There are nine commands: <b>c2c_encode</b>, <b>c2c_decode</b>,
  <b>c2c_bruteforce</b>, <b>r2c_encode</b>, <b>r2c_decode</b>,
  <b>r2c_bruteforce</b>, <b>c2r_encode</b>, <b>c2r_decode</b> and
  <b>c2r_bruteforce</b>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The first three letters of each command are short for: 'column to column',
  &#x00B4;column to row' and 'row to column'; these refer to different ways in
  which the ciphertext can be read off the table. In <b>c2c</b>, the table is
  written from left to right, re&#x2010;ordered and read off left to right
  again. In <b>r2c</b>, the table is written from top to bottom,
  re&#x2010;ordered and then read off from left to right. Finally, in <b>c2r</b>
  the table is written left to right, re&#x2010;ordered and read off from top to
  bottom.
<div class="Pp"></div>
&#x00B4;Encode' and 'decode' mode both take a keyword and work as one would
  expect. In 'bruteforce' mode, <b>cifer</b> tries all permutations of
  increasing key lengths in an attempt to find the real keyword. It tests
  possible solutions by matching words in the dictionary.
