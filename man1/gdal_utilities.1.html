&Acirc;&middot; gdalcompare.py - Compare two images and

Access an existing file to read it is generally quite
simple. Just indicate the name of the file or dataset on the
command line. However, creating a file is more complicated.
It <br>
may be necessary to indicate the the format to create,
various creation options affecting how it will be created
and perhaps a coordinate system to be assigned. Many of
these <br>
options are handled similarly by different GDAL utilities,
and are introduced here. <br>
-of format <br>
Select the format to create the new file as. The formats are
assigned short names such as GTiff (for GeoTIFF) or HFA (for
Erdas Imagine). The list of all format codes can be <br>
listed with the --formats switch. Only formats list as
&rsquo;(rw)&rsquo; (read-write) can be written. <br>
Many utilities default to creating GeoTIFF files if a format
is not specified. File extensions are not used to guess
output format, nor are extensions generally added by GDAL if
<br>
not indicated in the filename by the user. <br>
-co NAME=VALUE <br>
Many formats have one or more optional creation options that
can be used to control particulars about the file created.
For instance, the GeoTIFF driver supports creation <br>
options to control compression, and whether the file should
be tiled. <br>
The creation options available vary by format driver, and
some simple formats have no creation options at all. A list
of options supported for a format can be listed with the
<br>
&rsquo;--format &lt;format&gt;&rsquo; command line option
but the web page for the format is the definitive source of
information on driver creation options. <br>
-a_srs SRS <br>
Several utilities, (gdal_translate and gdalwarp) include the
ability to specify coordinate systems with command line
options like -a_srs (assign SRS to output), -s_srs <br>
(source SRS) and -t_srs (target SRS). <br>
These utilities allow the coordinate system (SRS = spatial
reference system) to be assigned in a variety of formats.
<br>
&Acirc;&middot; NAD27/NAD83/WGS84/WGS72: These common
geographic (lat/long) coordinate systems can be used
directly by these names. <br>
&Acirc;&middot; EPSG:n: Coordinate systems (projected or
geographic) can be selected based on their EPSG codes, for
instance EPSG:27700 is the British National Grid. A list of
EPSG coordinate <br>
systems can be found in the GDAL data files gcs.csv and
pcs.csv. <br>
&Acirc;&middot; PROJ.4 Definitions: A PROJ.4 definition
string can be used as a coordinate system. For instance
&rsquo;+proj=utm +zone=11 +datum=WGS84&rsquo;. Take care to
keep the proj.4 string together <br>
as a single argument to the command (usually by double
quoting). <br>
&Acirc;&middot; OpenGIS Well Known Text: The Open GIS
Consortium has defined a textual format for describing
coordinate systems as part of the Simple Features
specifications. This format is <br>
the internal working format for coordinate systems used in
GDAL. The name of a file containing a WKT coordinate system
definition may be used a coordinate system argument, or <br>
the entire coordinate system itself may be used as a command
line option (though escaping all the quotes in WKT is quite
challenging). <br>
&Acirc;&middot; ESRI Well Known Text: ESRI uses a slight
variation on OGC WKT format in their ArcGIS product (ArcGIS
.prj files), and these may be used in a similar manner to
WKT files, but <br>
the filename should be prefixed with ESRI::. For example
&rsquo;ESRI::NAD 1927 StatePlane Wyoming West FIPS
4904.prj&rsquo;. <br>
&Acirc;&middot; Spatial References from URLs: For example
http://spatialreference.org/ref/user/north-pacific-albers-conic-equal-area/.
<br>
&Acirc;&middot; filename: The name of a file containing WKT,
PROJ.4 strings, or XML/GML coordinate system definitions can
be provided. General Command Line Switches <br>
All GDAL command line utility programs support the following
&rsquo;general&rsquo; options. <br>
--version <br>
Report the version of GDAL and exit. <br>
--formats <br>
List all raster formats supported by this GDAL build
(read-only and read-write) and exit. The format support is
indicated as follows: &rsquo;ro&rsquo; is read-only driver;
&rsquo;rw&rsquo; is read <br>
or write (i.e. supports CreateCopy); &rsquo;rw+&rsquo; is
read, write and update (i.e. supports Create). A
&rsquo;v&rsquo; is appended for formats supporting virtual
IO (/vsimem, /vsigzip, /vsizip, <br>
etc). A &rsquo;s&rsquo; is appended for formats supporting
subdatasets. Note: The valid formats for the output of
gdalwarp are formats that support the Create() method
(marked as rw+), <br>
not just the CreateCopy() method. <br>
--format format <br>
List detailed information about a single format driver. The
format should be the short name reported in the --formats
list, such as GTiff. <br>
--optfile file <br>
Read the named file and substitute the contents into the
command line options list. Lines beginning with # will be
ignored. Multi-word arguments may be kept together with <br>
double quotes. <br>
--config key value <br>
Sets the named configuration keyword to the given value, as
opposed to setting them as environment variables. Some
common configuration keywords are GDAL_CACHEMAX (memory <br>
used internally for caching in megabytes) and GDAL_DATA
(path of the GDAL &rsquo;data&rsquo; directory). Individual
drivers may be influenced by other configuration options.
<br>
--debug value <br>
Control what debugging messages are emitted. A value of ON
will enable all debug messages. A value of OFF will disable
all debug messages. Another value will select only <br>
debug messages containing that string in the debug prefix
code. <br>
--help-general <br>
Gives a brief usage message for the generic GDAL command
line options and exit. GDAL Thu Feb 2 2017
