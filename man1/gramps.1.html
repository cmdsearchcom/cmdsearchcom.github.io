<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
gramps - Genealogical Research and Analysis Management
Programming System.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
gramps [-?|--help] [--usage] [--version] [-l]
[-u|--force-unlock] [-O|--open= DATABASE [-f|--format=
FORMAT]] [-i|--import= FILE [-f|--format= FORMAT]]

[--version]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Gramps is a Free/OpenSource genealogy program. It is written
in Python, using the GTK+/GNOME interface. Gramps should
seem familiar to anyone who has used other genealogy
pro&acirc; <br>
grams before such as Family Tree Maker (TM), Personal
Ancestral Files (TM), or the GNU Geneweb. It supports
importing of the ever popular GEDCOM format which is used
world wide <br>
by almost all other genealogy software.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
gramps FILE <br>
When FILE is given (without any flags) as a family tree name
or as a family tree database directory, then it is opened
and an interactive session is started. If FILE is a <br>
file format understood by Gramps, an empty family tree is
created whose name is based on the FILE name and the data is
imported into it. The rest of the options is <br>
ignored. This way of launching is suitable for using gramps
as a handler for genealogical data in e.g. web browsers.
This invocation can accept any data format native to <br>
gramps, see below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f,--format= FORMAT <br>
Explicitly specify format of FILE given by preceding -i, or
-e option. If the -f option is not given for any FILE, the
format of that file is guessed according to its <br>
extension or MIME-type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Formats available for export are
gramps-xml (guessed if FILE ends with .gramps), gedcom
(guessed if FILE ends with .ged), or any file export
available through the Gramps <br>
plugin system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Formats available for import are
grdb, gramps-xml, gedcom, gramps-pkg (guessed if FILE ends
with .gpkg), and geneweb (guessed if FILE ends with
.gw).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Formats available for export are
gramps-xml, gedcom, gramps-pkg, wft (guessed if FILE ends
with .wft), geneweb, and iso (never guessed, always specify
with -f option).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l Print a list of known family
trees.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u,--force-unlock <br>
Unlock a locked database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O,--open= DATABASE <br>
Open DATABASE which must be an existing database directory
or existing family tree name. If no action, import or export
options are given on the command line then an <br>
interactive session is started using that database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i,--import= FILE <br>
Import data from FILE. If you haven&rsquo;t specified a
database, then an empty database is created for you called
Family Tree x (where x is an incrementing number).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When more than one input file is
given, each has to be preceded by -i flag. The files are
imported in the specified order, i.e. -i FILE1 -i FILE2 and
-i FILE2 -i FILE1 <br>
might produce different gramps IDs in the resulting
database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e,--export= FILE <br>
Export data into FILE. For gramps-xml, gedcom, wft,
gramps-pkg, and geneweb, the FILE is the name of the
resulting file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When more than one output file
is given, each has to be preceded by -e flag. The files are
written one by one, in the specified order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a,--action= ACTION <br>
Perform ACTION on the imported data. This is done after all
imports are successfully completed. Currently available
actions are summary (same as Reports-&gt;View-&gt;Summary),
<br>
check (same as Tools-&gt;Database Processing-&gt;Check and
Repair), report (generates report), and tool (runs a plugin
tool). Both report and tool need the OPTIONSTRING sup&acirc;
<br>
plied by the -p flag).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The OPTIONSTRING should satisfy
the following conditions: <br>
It must not contain any spaces. If some arguments need to
include spaces, the string should be enclosed with quotation
marks, i.e., follow the shell syntax. Option <br>
string is a list of pairs with name and value (separated by
the equality sign). The name and value pairs must be
separated by commas.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most of the report or tools
options are specific for each report or tool. However, there
are some common options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">name=name <br>
This mandatory option determines which report or tool will
be run. If the supplied name does not correspond to any
available report or tool, an error message will be <br>
printed followed by the list of available reports or tools
(depending on the ACTION).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">show=all <br>
This will produce the list of names for all options
available for a given report or tool.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">show=optionname <br>
This will print the description of the functionality
supplied by optionname, as well as what are the acceptable
types and values for this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use the above options to find
out everything about a given report.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When more than one output action
is given, each has to be preceded by -a flag. The actions
are performed one by one, in the specified order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d,--debug= LOGGER_NAME <br>
Enables debug logs for development and testing. Look at the
source code for details</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Prints the version number of gramps and then exits</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Operation <br>
If the first argument on the command line does not start
with dash (i.e. no flag), gramps will attempt to open the
file with the name given by the first argument and start
inter&acirc; <br>
active session, ignoring the rest of the command line
arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -O flag is given, then
gramps will try opening the supplied database and then work
with that data, as instructed by the further command line
parameters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With or without the -O flag,
there could be multiple imports, exports, and actions
specified further on the command line by using -i, -e, and
-a flags.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The order of -i, -e, or -a
options does not matter. The actual order always is: all
imports (if any) -&gt; all actions (if any) -&gt; all
exports (if any). But opening must always be <br>
first!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no -O or -i option is given,
gramps will launch its main window and start the usual
interactive session with the empty database, since there is
no data to process, anyway.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no -e or -a options are
given, gramps will launch its main window and start the
usual interactive session with the database resulted from
all imports. This database resides in <br>
the import_db.grdb under ~/.gramps/import directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The error encountered during
import, export, or action, will be either dumped to stdout
(if these are exceptions handled by gramps) or to stderr (if
these are not handled). Use <br>
usual shell redirections of stdout and stderr to save
messages and errors in files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
To open an existing family tree and import an xml file into
it, one may type: <br>
gramps -O &rsquo;My Family Tree&rsquo; -i ~/db3.gramps</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The above changes the opened
family tree, to do the same, but import both in a temporary
family tree and start an interactive session, one may type:
<br>
gramps -i &rsquo;My Family Tree&rsquo; -i ~/db3.gramps</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To import four databases (whose
formats can be determined from their names) and then check
the resulting database for errors, one may type: <br>
gramps -i file1.ged -i file2.tgz -i ~/db3.gramps -i
file4.wft -a check</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To explicitly specify the
formats in the above example, append filenames with
appropriate -f options: <br>
gramps -i file1.ged -f gedcom -i file2.tgz -f gramps-pkg -i
~/db3.gramps -f gramps-xml -i file4.wft -f wft -a check</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To record the database resulting
from all imports, supply -e flag (use -f if the filename
does not allow gramps to guess the format): <br>
gramps -i file1.ged -i file2.tgz -e ~/new-package -f
gramps-pkg</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To import three databases and
start interactive gramps session with the result: <br>
gramps -i file1.ged -i file2.tgz -i ~/db3.gramps</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To run the Verify tool from the
commandline and output the result to stdout: <br>
gramps -O &rsquo;My Family Tree&rsquo; -a tool -p
name=verify</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, to start normal
interactive session type: <br>
gramps</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
The program checks whether these environment variables are
set:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LANG - describe, which language
to use: Ex.: for polish language this variable has to be set
to pl_PL.UTF-8.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GRAMPSHOME - if set, force
Gramps to use the specified directory to keep program
settings and databases there. By default, this variable is
not set and gramps assumes that the <br>
folder with all databases and profile settings should be
created within the user profile folder (described by
environment variable HOME for Linux or USERPROFILE for
Windows <br>
2000/XP).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONCEPTS <br>
Supports a python-based plugin system, allowing import and
export writers, report generators, tools, and display
filters to be added without modification of the main
program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition to generating direct
printer output, report generators also target other systems,
such as OpenOffice.org, AbiWord, HTML, or LaTeX to allow the
users to modify the <br>
format to suit their needs.</p>
