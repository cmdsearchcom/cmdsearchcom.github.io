<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pamsistoaglyph - convert a single-image stereogram to a
red/cyan anaglyphic image</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pamsistoaglyph [--invert] [--sep=number] [--minsep=number]
[--gray=number] [in_netpbmfile</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All options can be abbreviated
to their shortest unique prefix. You may use either white
space or an equals sign between an option name and its
value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This program is part of Netpbm(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pamsistoaglyph reads a Netpbm
image as input and produces a Netpbm image as output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pamsistoaglyph takes a
single-image stereogram (SIS) such as those produced by
pamstereogram(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and converts it to a red/cyan
anaglyphic image such as those produced by ppm3d(1) Many
people have trouble tricking their eyes into focusing beyond
the image in front of them and <br>
are therefore unable to perceive the 3-D shape hidden within
a single-image stereogram. Anaglyphic stereograms are easier
to perceive in 3-D but require a pair of red/cyan <br>
glasses such as those often used to watch 3-D movies. The
goal of pamsistoaglyph is to help people who have trouble
viewing single-image stereograms see the intriguing 3-D <br>
effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pamsistoaglyph can convert
single-image random-dot stereograms (SIRDS), wallpaper
stereograms, and even dual-image stereograms to anaglyphic
images.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
For most images, no command-line options need to be
specified. The following options are available, however, for
unusual circumstances:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--invert <br>
Swap the left- and right-eye <br>
images. pamsistoaglyph assumes that its input <br>
represents a wall-eyed stereogram and generates the
anaglyphic <br>
image accordingly. If the generated image appears to recede
into <br>
the page where it should pop out of the page (and vice
versa), <br>
this typically implies that the input image represents a
<br>
cross-eyed stereogram. Use --invert to correct <br>
the image depth.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--sep=number <br>
Specify the distance in pixels between the left- and
right-eye <br>
images. Essentially, this corresponds to the distance
between <br>
repetitions of the background pattern. The --sep <br>
option should rarely be necessary <br>
as pamsistoaglyph is fairly good at determining <br>
automatically the eye-separation distance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--minsep=number <br>
This option is similar to --sep but <br>
constrains pamsistoaglyph only to <br>
a minimum eye-separation distance. Any distance larger <br>
than number is acceptable. The --minsep <br>
option should rarely be necessary <br>
as pamsistoaglyph is fairly good at determining <br>
automatically the eye-separation distance. The default value
for <br>
the minimum eye-separation distance is 10% of the image
width; <br>
this value seems to work well in practice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--gray=number <br>
Limit the number of gray levels to use when searching for
the <br>
optimal eye-separation <br>
distance. Because pamsistoaglyph looks for <br>
repeated patterns, it is vulnerable to being confused by
slight <br>
variations in color. By reducing the input image to
grayscale and <br>
capping the number of gray levels, <br>
pamsistoaglyph ameliorates the effects of <br>
unintentional color variations (such as those caused by
conversion <br>
from a low-quality JPEG image, for example). The default of
63 <br>
seems to work well so the --gray option should <br>
rarely be necessary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
The registration algorithm used by pamsistoaglyph was
developed specifically for this program. As far as the
author knows, there are no existing algorithms for
converting stere&acirc; <br>
ograms to anaglyphs. The algorithm works as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Convert the
image to grayscale to increase the ability to identify <br>
matches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Count the number
of pixels that match N pixels ahead in the <br>
image for all N in [1, width/2].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Maintain a
running mean (&amp;mu;) and standard deviation (&amp;sigma;)
of <br>
the number of matched pixels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Store the N
corresponding to each spike in the number of <br>
matched pixels. A spike is defined as a tally that exceeds
the <br>
mean plus one, two, or three standard deviations. Only the
first <br>
spike of a given standard-deviation multiplier is
stored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If a tally
greater than &amp;mu;+3&amp;sigma; was encountered, return
the <br>
corresponding N. If not, then if a tally greater than <br>
&amp;mu;+2&amp;sigma; was encountered, return the <br>
corresponding N. If not, then if a tally greater than <br>
&amp;mu;+&amp;sigma; was encountered, return the <br>
corresponding N. If not, then return the N that <br>
produces the minimum average distance between matched pixels
<br>
(i.e., #matches divided by #pixels). If no <br>
such N exceeds the minimum allowable eye-separation value,
<br>
return zero to indicate failure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If the algorithm
returned zero, rerun the algorithm independently <br>
on each row of the input image and return the median of <br>
all N that exceed the minimum allowable eye-separation <br>
value. If no such N exists, abort with an error <br>
message.</p>
