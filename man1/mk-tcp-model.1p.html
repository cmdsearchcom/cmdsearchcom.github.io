mk-tcp-model - Transform tcpdump into metrics that permit performance and
  scalability modeling.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
Usage: mk-tcp-model [OPTION...] [FILE]
<div class="Pp"></div>
mk-tcp-model parses and analyzes tcpdump files. With no FILE, or when FILE is -,
  it read standard input.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Dump TCP requests and responses to a file, capturing only the packet headers to
  avoid dropped packets, and ignoring any packets without a payload (such as
  ack-only packets). Capture port 3306 (MySQL database traffic). Note that to
  avoid line breaking in terminals and man pages, the TCP filtering expression
  that follows has a line break at the end of the second line; you should omit
  this from your tcpdump command.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 tcpdump -s 384 -i any -nnq -tttt \
        'tcp port 3306 and (((ip[2:2] - ((ip[0]&amp;0xf)&lt;&lt;2)) 
      - ((tcp[12]&amp;0xf0)&gt;&gt;2)) != 0)' \
   &gt; /path/to/tcp-file.txt
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Extract individual response times, sorted by end time:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 mk-tcp-model /path/to/tcp-file.txt &gt; requests.txt
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Sort the result by arrival time, for input to the next step:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 sort -n -k1,1 requests.txt &gt; sorted.txt
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Slice the result into 10-second intervals and emit throughput, concurrency, and
  response time metrics for each interval:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 mk-tcp-model --type=requests --run-time=10 sorted.txt &gt; sliced.txt
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Transform the result for modeling with Aspersa's usl tool, discarding the first
  and last line of each file if you specify multiple files (the first and last
  line are normally incomplete observation periods and are aberrant):
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 for f in sliced.txt; do
    tail -n +2 &quot;$f&quot; | head -n -1 | awk '{print $2, $3, $7/$4}'
 done &gt; usl-input.txt
</pre>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="RISKS"><a class="selflink" href="#RISKS">RISKS</a></h1>
The following section is included to inform users about the potential risks,
  whether known or unknown, of using this tool. The two main categories of risks
  are those created by the nature of the tool (e.g. read-only tools vs.
  read-write tools) and those created by bugs.
<div class="Pp"></div>
mk-tcp-model merely reads and transforms its input, printing it to the output.
  It should be very low risk.
<div class="Pp"></div>
At the time of this release, we know of no bugs that could cause serious harm to
  users.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The authoritative source for updated information is always the online issue
  tracking system. Issues that affect this tool will be marked as such. You can
  see a list of such issues at the following URL:
  &lt;http://www.maatkit.org/bugs/mk-tcp-model&gt;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
See also &quot;BUGS&quot; for more information on filing bugs and getting help.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
This tool recognizes requests and responses in a TCP stream, and extracts the
  &quot;conversations&quot;. You can use it to capture the response times of
  individual queries to a database, for example. It expects the TCP input to be
  in the following format, which should result from the sample shown in the
  SYNOPSIS:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 &lt;date&gt; &lt;time.microseconds&gt; IP &lt;IP.port&gt; &gt; &lt;IP.port&gt;: &lt;junk&gt;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The tool watches for &quot;incoming&quot; packets to the port you specify with
  the &quot;--watch-server&quot; option. This begins a request. If multiple
  inbound packets follow each other, then by default the last inbound packet
  seen determines the time at which the request is assumed to begin. This is
  logical if one assumes that a server must receive the whole SQL statement
  before beginning execution, for example.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When the first outbound packet is seen, the server is considered to have
  responded to the request. The tool might see an inbound packet, but never see
  a response. This can happen when the kernel drops packets, for example. As a
  result, the tool never prints a request unless it sees the response to it.
  However, the tool actually does not print any request until it sees the
  &quot;last&quot; outbound packet. It determines this by waiting for either
  another inbound packet, or EOF, and then considers the previous
  inbound/outbound pair to be complete. As a result, the tool prints requests in
  a relatively random order. Most types of analysis require processing in either
  arrival or completion order. Therefore, the second type of processing this
  tool can do requires that you sort the output from the first stage and supply
  it as input.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The second type of processing is selected with the &quot;--type&quot; option set
  to &quot;requests&quot;. In this mode, the tool reads a group of requests and
  aggregates them, then emits the aggregated metrics.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OUTPUT"><a class="selflink" href="#OUTPUT">OUTPUT</a></h1>
In the default mode (parsing tcpdump output), requests are printed out one per
  line, in the following format:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 &lt;id&gt; &lt;start&gt; &lt;end&gt; &lt;elapsed&gt; &lt;IP:port&gt;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The ID is an incrementing number, assigned in arrival order in the original TCP
  traffic. The start and end timestamps, and the elapsed time, can be customized
  with the &quot;--start-end&quot; option.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In &quot;--type=requests&quot; mode, the tool prints out one line per time
  interval as defined by &quot;--run-time&quot;, with the following columns: ts,
  concurrency, throughput, arrivals, completions, busy_time, weighted_time,
  sum_time, variance_mean, quantile_time, obs_time. A detailed explanation
  follows:

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Define how the arrival and completion timestamps of a query, and thus its
      response time (elapsed time) are computed. Recall that there may be
      multiple inbound and outbound packets per request and response, and refer
      to the following ASCII diagram. Suppose that a client sends a series of
      three inbound (I) packets to the server, whch computes the result and then
      sends two outbound (O) packets back:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
  I I    I ..................... O    O
  |&lt;----&gt;|&lt;---response time-----&gt;|&lt;--&gt;|
  ts0    ts                      end  end1
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    By default, the query is considered to arrive at time ts, and complete at
      time end. However, this might not be what you want. Perhaps you do not
      want to consider the query to have completed until time end1. You can
      accomplish this by setting this option to &quot;ts,end1&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">--type</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">type: string
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The type of input to parse (default tcpdump). The permitted types are</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">tcpdump</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The parser expects the input to be formatted with the
      following options: &quot;-x -n -q -tttt&quot;. For example, if you want to
      capture output from your local machine, you can do something like the
      following (the port must come last on FreeBSD):
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
  tcpdump -s 65535 -x -nn -q -tttt -i any -c 1000 port 3306 \
    &gt; mysql.tcp.txt
  mk-query-digest --type tcpdump mysql.tcp.txt
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The other tcpdump parameters, such as -s, -c, and -i, are up to you. Just
      make sure the output looks like this (there is a line break in the first
      line to avoid man-page problems):
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
  2009-04-12 09:50:16.804849 IP 127.0.0.1.42167
         &gt; 127.0.0.1.3306: tcp 37
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    All MySQL servers running on port 3306 are automatically detected in the
      tcpdump output. Therefore, if the tcpdump out contains packets from
      multiple servers on port 3306 (for example, 10.0.0.1:3306, 10.0.0.2:3306,
      etc.), all packets/queries from all these servers will be analyzed
      together as if they were one server.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If you're analyzing traffic for a protocol that is not running on port 3306,
      see &quot;--watch-server&quot;.</dd>

<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;"></div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">--version</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Show version and exit.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">--watch-server</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">type: string; default: 10.10.10.10:3306
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This option tells mk-tcp-model which server IP address and port (such as
      &quot;10.0.0.1:3306&quot;) to watch when parsing tcpdump for
      &quot;--type&quot; tcpdump. If you don't specify it, the tool watches all
      servers by looking for any IP address using port 3306. If you're watching
      a server with a non-standard port, this won't work, so you must specify
      the IP address and port to watch.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Currently, IP address filtering isn't implemented; so even though you must
      specify the option in IP:port form, it ignores the IP and only looks at
      the port number.</dd>
