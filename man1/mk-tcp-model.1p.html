<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
mk-tcp-model - Transform tcpdump into metrics that permit
performance and scalability modeling.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
Usage: mk-tcp-model [OPTION...] [FILE]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mk-tcp-model parses and analyzes
tcpdump files. With no FILE, or when FILE is -, it read
standard input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Dump TCP requests and responses
to a file, capturing only the packet headers to avoid
dropped packets, and ignoring any packets without a payload
(such as ack-only packets). <br>
Capture port 3306 (MySQL database traffic). Note that to
avoid line breaking in terminals and man pages, the TCP
filtering expression that follows has a line break at the
end of <br>
the second line; you should omit this from your tcpdump
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tcpdump -s 384 -i any -nnq -tttt
&rsquo;tcp port 3306 and (((ip[2:2] -
((ip[0]&amp;0xf)&lt;&lt;2)) <br>
- ((tcp[12]&amp;0xf0)&gt;&gt;2)) != 0)&rsquo; &gt;
/path/to/tcp-file.txt</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Extract individual response
times, sorted by end time:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mk-tcp-model
/path/to/tcp-file.txt &gt; requests.txt</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sort the result by arrival time,
for input to the next step:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sort -n -k1,1 requests.txt &gt;
sorted.txt</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Slice the result into 10-second
intervals and emit throughput, concurrency, and response
time metrics for each interval:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mk-tcp-model --type=requests
--run-time=10 sorted.txt &gt; sliced.txt</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Transform the result for
modeling with Aspersa&rsquo;s usl tool, discarding the first
and last line of each file if you specify multiple files
(the first and last line are normally <br>
incomplete observation periods and are aberrant):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">for f in sliced.txt; do <br>
tail -n +2 &quot;$f&quot; | head -n -1 | awk &rsquo;{print
$2, $3, $7/$4}&rsquo; <br>
done &gt; usl-input.txt</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RISKS <br>
The following section is included to inform users about the
potential risks, whether known or unknown, of using this
tool. The two main categories of risks are those created by
<br>
the nature of the tool (e.g. read-only tools vs. read-write
tools) and those created by bugs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mk-tcp-model merely reads and
transforms its input, printing it to the output. It should
be very low risk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At the time of this release, we
know of no bugs that could cause serious harm to users.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The authoritative source for
updated information is always the online issue tracking
system. Issues that affect this tool will be marked as such.
You can see a list of such <br>
issues at the following URL:
&lt;http://www.maatkit.org/bugs/mk-tcp-model&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See also &quot;BUGS&quot; for
more information on filing bugs and getting help.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This tool recognizes requests and responses in a TCP stream,
and extracts the &quot;conversations&quot;. You can use it
to capture the response times of individual queries to a
database, <br>
for example. It expects the TCP input to be in the following
format, which should result from the sample shown in the
SYNOPSIS:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;date&gt;
&lt;time.microseconds&gt; IP &lt;IP.port&gt; &gt;
&lt;IP.port&gt;: &lt;junk&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The tool watches for
&quot;incoming&quot; packets to the port you specify with
the &quot;--watch-server&quot; option. This begins a
request. If multiple inbound packets follow each other, then
by <br>
default the last inbound packet seen determines the time at
which the request is assumed to begin. This is logical if
one assumes that a server must receive the whole SQL <br>
statement before beginning execution, for example.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the first outbound packet
is seen, the server is considered to have responded to the
request. The tool might see an inbound packet, but never see
a response. This can <br>
happen when the kernel drops packets, for example. As a
result, the tool never prints a request unless it sees the
response to it. However, the tool actually does not print
any <br>
request until it sees the &quot;last&quot; outbound packet.
It determines this by waiting for either another inbound
packet, or EOF, and then considers the previous
inbound/outbound pair <br>
to be complete. As a result, the tool prints requests in a
relatively random order. Most types of analysis require
processing in either arrival or completion order. Therefore,
<br>
the second type of processing this tool can do requires that
you sort the output from the first stage and supply it as
input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The second type of processing is
selected with the &quot;--type&quot; option set to
&quot;requests&quot;. In this mode, the tool reads a group
of requests and aggregates them, then emits the <br>
aggregated metrics.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT <br>
In the default mode (parsing tcpdump output), requests are
printed out one per line, in the following format:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;id&gt; &lt;start&gt;
&lt;end&gt; &lt;elapsed&gt; &lt;IP:port&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ID is an incrementing
number, assigned in arrival order in the original TCP
traffic. The start and end timestamps, and the elapsed time,
can be customized with the <br>
&quot;--start-end&quot; option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In &quot;--type=requests&quot;
mode, the tool prints out one line per time interval as
defined by &quot;--run-time&quot;, with the following
columns: ts, concurrency, throughput, arrivals, <br>
completions, busy_time, weighted_time, sum_time,
variance_mean, quantile_time, obs_time. A detailed
explanation follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ts The timestamp that defines
the beginning of the interval.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">concurrency <br>
The average number of requests resident in the server during
the interval.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">throughput <br>
The number of arrivals per second during the interval.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">arrivals <br>
The number of arrivals during the interval.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">completions <br>
The number of completions during the interval.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">busy_time <br>
The total amount of time during which at least one request
was resident in the server during the interval.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">weighted_time <br>
The total response time of all the requests resident in the
server during the interval, including requests that neither
arrived nor completed during the interval.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sum_time <br>
The total response time of all the requests that arrived in
the interval.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">variance_mean <br>
The variance-to-mean ratio (index of dispersion) of the
response times of the requests that arrived in the
interval.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">quantile_time <br>
The Nth percentile response time for all the requests that
arrived in the interval. See also
&quot;--quantile&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">obs_time <br>
The length of the observation time window. This will usually
be the same as the interval length, except for the first and
last intervals in a file, which might have a <br>
shorter observation time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
This tool accepts additional command-line arguments. Refer
to the &quot;SYNOPSIS&quot; and usage information for
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--config <br>
type: Array</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Read this comma-separated list
of config files; if specified, this must be the first option
on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help <br>
Show help and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--progress <br>
type: array; default: time,30</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Print progress reports to
STDERR. The value is a comma-separated list with two parts.
The first part can be percentage, time, or iterations; the
second part specifies how <br>
often an update should be printed, in percentage, seconds,
or number of iterations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--quantile <br>
type: float</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The percentile for the last
column when &quot;--type&quot; is &quot;requests&quot;
(default .99).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--run-time <br>
type: float</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The size of the aggregation
interval in seconds when &quot;--type&quot; is
&quot;requests&quot; (default 1). Fractional values are
permitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--start-end <br>
type: Array; default: ts,end</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Define how the arrival and
completion timestamps of a query, and thus its response time
(elapsed time) are computed. Recall that there may be
multiple inbound and outbound <br>
packets per request and response, and refer to the following
ASCII diagram. Suppose that a client sends a series of three
inbound (I) packets to the server, whch computes <br>
the result and then sends two outbound (O) packets back:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">I I I ..................... O O
<br>
|&lt;----&gt;|&lt;---response time-----&gt;|&lt;--&gt;| <br>
ts0 ts end end1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, the query is
considered to arrive at time ts, and complete at time end.
However, this might not be what you want. Perhaps you do not
want to consider the query <br>
to have completed until time end1. You can accomplish this
by setting this option to &quot;ts,end1&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--type <br>
type: string</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The type of input to parse
(default tcpdump). The permitted types are</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tcpdump <br>
The parser expects the input to be formatted with the
following options: &quot;-x -n -q -tttt&quot;. For example,
if you want to capture output from your local machine, you
can do <br>
something like the following (the port must come last on
FreeBSD):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tcpdump -s 65535 -x -nn -q -tttt
-i any -c 1000 port 3306 &gt; mysql.tcp.txt <br>
mk-query-digest --type tcpdump mysql.tcp.txt</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The other tcpdump parameters,
such as -s, -c, and -i, are up to you. Just make sure the
output looks like this (there is a line break in the first
line to avoid man-page <br>
problems):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2009-04-12 09:50:16.804849 IP
127.0.0.1.42167 <br>
&gt; 127.0.0.1.3306: tcp 37</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All MySQL servers running on
port 3306 are automatically detected in the tcpdump output.
Therefore, if the tcpdump out contains packets from multiple
servers on port <br>
3306 (for example, 10.0.0.1:3306, 10.0.0.2:3306, etc.), all
packets/queries from all these servers will be analyzed
together as if they were one server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you&rsquo;re analyzing
traffic for a protocol that is not running on port 3306, see
&quot;--watch-server&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Show version and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--watch-server <br>
type: string; default: 10.10.10.10:3306</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option tells mk-tcp-model
which server IP address and port (such as
&quot;10.0.0.1:3306&quot;) to watch when parsing tcpdump for
&quot;--type&quot; tcpdump. If you don&rsquo;t specify it,
the <br>
tool watches all servers by looking for any IP address using
port 3306. If you&rsquo;re watching a server with a
non-standard port, this won&rsquo;t work, so you must
specify the IP <br>
address and port to watch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Currently, IP address filtering
isn&rsquo;t implemented; so even though you must specify the
option in IP:port form, it ignores the IP and only looks at
the port number.</p>
