<p>FvwmProxy(1) Fvwm Modules FvwmProxy(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
FvwmProxy - the fvwm proxy module</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
FvwmProxy is spawned by fvwm, so no command line invocation
will work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The FvwmProxy allows the user to locate and control windows
obscured by other windows by using small non-overlapping
proxy windows. The default capabilities include raising and
<br>
lowering the proxied windows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using the sample configuration,
pressing Alt-Tab cycles through the windows and allows the
use of assignable click actions on the proxies. Releasing
the Alt key deactivates the <br>
proxy windows. By default, pressing the left or right mouse
buttons on a proxy window raises or lowers the associated
proxied window respectively. An additional mapping can <br>
have the proxies automatically appear by just holding the
Alt key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Proxy windows are always on top
and try to center on the regular window they proxy. A simple
collision algorithm tweaks the positions of the proxy
windows to prevent them from <br>
overlapping.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COPYRIGHTS <br>
The FvwmProxy program is original work by Jason Weber.</p>

guarantees or warranties or anything are provided or implied
in any way whatsoever. Use this program at your own
risk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INVOCATION <br>
FvwmProxy can be invoked by inserting the line &rsquo;Module
FvwmProxy&rsquo; in the .fvwm2rc file. This can be placed on
a line by itself, if FvwmProxy is to be spawned during
fvwm&rsquo;s ini&acirc; <br>
tialization, or can be bound to a menu or mouse button or
keystroke to invoke it later. Fvwm will search directory
specified in the ModulePath configuration option to attempt
to <br>
locate FvwmProxy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION OPTIONS <br>
*FvwmProxy: Colorset n <br>
Specifies the color theme for unselected proxy windows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmProxy: SelectColorset n
<br>
Specifies the color theme for the selected proxy window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmProxy: IconifiedColorset n
<br>
Specifies the color theme for proxy windows of iconified
windows. This is only meaningful in conjunction with the
ProxyIconified option on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmProxy: Font font <br>
Specifies the font used for large proxy window text. This
usually contains the icon string and is nearly vertically
centered in the proxy. If there is no icon string, <br>
the title bar string is used. If this text exceeds the width
of the proxy, it is cropped on the right. If no Font is
specified, a default is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmProxy: SmallFont font <br>
Specifies the font used for the auxiliary proxy window text.
This usually contains the title bar string, but is omitted
if it is identical to the icon string and that <br>
text was not cropped. The text is drawn close to the bottom
of the proxy and should probably be the smallest legible
font available. If this text exceeds the width of <br>
the proxy, it is cropped on the left. If no SmallFont is
specified, this text is never drawn.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmProxy: Width w <br>
Specifies the size in X of each proxy window. The default is
180.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmProxy: Height h <br>
Specifies the size in Y of each proxy window. The default is
60.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmProxy: Separation d <br>
Specifies the minimum distance between proxy windows when
adjusting for collisions. The default is 10.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmProxy: ShowMiniIcons bool
<br>
If true, proxy windows show the mini icon for the window
they represent, if it has a mini icon. The default is
true.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmProxy: EnterSelect bool
<br>
If true, a proxy is automatically selected when the mouse is
moved over the proxy, even if no mouse buttons are pressed.
The default is false.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmProxy: ProxyMove bool <br>
If true, moving a proxy window will move the window it
represents. Currently, the proxied window doesn&rsquo;t
recognize snap effects during this operation. The default is
<br>
false.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmProxy: ProxyIconified bool
<br>
If true, continue to show proxy windows when they are
iconified. In addition, consider adding click actions that
Iconify on and off, such as on the middlemouse button. <br>
The default is false.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmProxy: ShowOnly mode <br>
Limits the appearance of proxy windows during the Show
action. The supported modes are Selected, Covered, Grouped,
and All. The default is All which shows every proxy <br>
window on the current desk. Select mode will only show the
proxy window for the selected window. If no window is
selected, the currently focused window is treated as the
<br>
select window for ShowOnly filtering. Covered mode extends
Select mode to add proxy windows that overlap the select
real window. Just using Selected mode can result in <br>
untouchable proxy windows that disappear before you can
reach them. Grouped mode extends Covered mode to show proxy
windows in the same window group as the selected win&acirc;
<br>
dow. In all cases, iconified proxy windows never appear if
ProxyIconified is false.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmProxy: Action mouseaction
response <br>
Tells FvwmProxy to do the specified response when the given
action is done. The currently supported mouse actions are:
Click1, Click2, Click3 and so on, representing <br>
mouse clicks with various buttons. By default, the module
supports 3 mouse buttons, but it can be compiled to support
more. The default responses are Raise, Nop, and <br>
Lower for Click1, Click2, and Click3, respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmProxy: Action Select
command <br>
This selects an fvwm function to be called during a
FvwmProxy Hide command for the window whose proxy was
selected. The default is WindowListFunc. WindowListFunc is
pre&acirc; <br>
defined by the fvwm install. You can replace it, add to it,
or supply an independent function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmProxy: Action Show command
<br>
This selects an fvwm function to be called during a
FvwmProxy Show command. The default is Nop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmProxy: Action Hide command
<br>
This selects an fvwm function to be called during a
FvwmProxy Hide command. The default is Nop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmProxy: Action Abort command
<br>
This selects an fvwm function to be called during a
FvwmProxy Abort command. The default is Nop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmProxy: Action Mark command
<br>
This selects an fvwm function to be called on a window after
it is marked. The default is Nop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmProxy: Action Unmark
command <br>
This selects an fvwm function to be called on a marked
window just after another window gets the mark. The default
is Nop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmProxy: Action
ModifierRelease modifiers command <br>
This selects an fvwm function to be called while proxies are
shown and the specified modifiers are all released. The
modifiers are specified using the same syntax as in <br>
the Mouse command. The default is Nop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmProxy: Group groupname
command pattern <br>
For the given named group, adjust inclusion of the windows
matching the pattern. The groupname is a string identifier
used to associate windows. The window pattern uses <br>
the same format as the Style command. The supported commands
are Include, SoftInclude, WeakInclude, WeakSoftInclude, and
Exclude. The commands ending in Include identify <br>
a pattern to add windows to the group. Exclude identifies
pattern to counteract inclusion pattern or auto-inclusion
(see flags below). All exclusion checks follow all <br>
inclusion checks. Soft inclusion limits the windows in that
pattern to only move when an non-soft window in the group
moves. Moving or resizing these windows does not <br>
affect any other windows. They are also immune to edge
effects. Soft inclusion also affects provocation effects
(see below). Weak inclusion prevents inclusion purely on
<br>
name, instead relying on X11 leader or process id matching.
Weakly included names will not start a group, but will join
a group in the same known process or with the same <br>
leader. Once the window has joined, the name is just used to
determine if the inclusion is soft.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmProxy: Group groupname flag
<br>
For the given named group, activate the given flag. The
supported flags are AutoInclude, AutoSoft, and IgnoreIDs.
All window grouping is normally checked to only group <br>
windows that are in the same process or that have the same
X11 client leader. IgnoreIDs deactivates this mechanism.
AutoInclude automatically includes any window that <br>
matches the same process or client leader, without having to
name them specifically. AutoSoft makes all AutoInclusions
soft (see inclusion description above).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmProxy: Group groupname
provocation pattern <br>
The provocation flags allow you to customize whether grouped
windows provoke each other in response to a raise/lower,
desk move, drag, or iconification change. The com&acirc;
<br>
pound provocation flag is of the form
(No|Inherit)(Hard|Soft)(Raise|Desk|Drag|Icon|All). The
pattern is optional and should already have been included.
The pattern lim&acirc; <br>
its the change to only affect that part of the group. The
first element of the flag is optional and can turn off the
effect, or, with a pattern, can dynamically inherit <br>
the setting for the group. The default is to turn the effect
on. The second element can be used to only apply the change
to windows with the soft state either on or off. <br>
The default is to change both. The third element specifies
what provoking effect is being changed: window raise/lower,
moving to another desk, dragging windows together, <br>
toggling iconification, or all of these. If either the
provoking window or a potentially provoked window has an
effect turned off, the provocation does not occur.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmProxy: SlotWidth w <br>
This specifies the width of the icons used in slots. The
default is 16.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmProxy: SlotHeight h <br>
This specifies the height of the icons used in slots. The
default is 16.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmProxy: SlotSpace d <br>
This specifies the space between icons used in slots. The
default is 4.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmProxy: GroupSlot n <br>
This specifies the first slot that represent a colored
group. Group slots don&rsquo;t need icons as the are drawn
by predetermined means. The default is 2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmProxy: GroupCount n <br>
This specifies the number of group slots. The default is
6.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmProxy: SlotStyle n style
<br>
For non-group slots, this defines the appears of the
indicated slot. The style format matches ButtonStyle
command. The default is nothing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmProxy: SlotAction n
mouseaction response <br>
For non-group slots, this defines the behavior of the
indicated slot. The mouse action and response is used the
same as the FvwmProxy Action configuration. The default <br>
is Nop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmProxy: UndoLimit n <br>
This specifies the number of entries in the undo buffer.
this limits how far back you can undo. The default is 8.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMANDS <br>
SendToModule FvwmProxy Show <br>
Activate proxy windows for all windows on the current desk
that do not use the WindowListSkip option. If the desk is
switched, new proxies are automatically generated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SendToModule FvwmProxy Hide <br>
Deactivate all proxy windows. If a proxy is selected (such
as with the Next and Prev commands), the Select Action is
call on the window that the proxy represents. The <br>
default action includes raising the window and warping the
mouse to a position over that window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SendToModule FvwmProxy
ShowToggle <br>
If shown, hide. If hidden, show.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SendToModule FvwmProxy Abort
<br>
Deactivate all proxy windows. This differs from the Hide
command in that no action is taken on any selected
window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SendToModule FvwmProxy Circulate
command <br>
Tell FvwmProxy to run a conditional command and mark the
result. The imbedded command SendToModule FvwmProxy Mark is
automatically appended after the optional condition, <br>
so supplying your own imbedded command will probably fail.
An example argument to Circulate is ScanForWindow East South
(CurrentPage). If the proxies aren&rsquo;t already <br>
shown (such as with the Show command), any Circulate command
will automatically show the proxies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SendToModule FvwmProxy Next
(obsolete) <br>
If a proxy window is selected, the next proxy is selected.
Windows with the WindowListSkip option are ignored. The
proxies are sorted left to right during the Show com&acirc;
<br>
mand. If no proxy is currently selected, but a proxy on this
desk was selected on a recent show, that proxy is selected.
If no proxy on this desk was recently selected, <br>
the leftmost proxy is used. This nearly duplicates the
functionality of Circulate ScanForWindow East South
(CurrentPage).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SendToModule FvwmProxy Prev
(obsolete) <br>
If a proxy window is selected, the previous proxy is
selected. The starting point is the same as with the Next
command, except that the choice with no recent selection is
<br>
the rightmost proxy. This nearly duplicates the
functionality of Circulate ScanForWindow West North
(CurrentPage).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SendToModule FvwmProxy
SoftToggle <br>
Toggle the soft group inclusion setting for the selected
window. This setting is the same that can be activated using
the SoftInclude and AutoSoft commands inside the <br>
FvwmProxy Group configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SendToModule FvwmProxy
IsolateToggle <br>
Toggle the isolation setting for the selected window&rsquo;s
group. Isolated groups only allow one member to not be
iconified at a time. The members are also coerced to the
<br>
same position and size, constrained by their size
increment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SendToModule FvwmProxy
PrevIsolated <br>
If focused on a member of a isolating group, deiconify the
member higher on list. If no member is higher, deiconify the
last member.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SendToModule FvwmProxy
NextIsolated <br>
If focused on a member of a isolating group, deiconify the
member lower on list. If no member is higher, deiconify the
first member.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SendToModule FvwmProxy Undo <br>
Attempt to undo the last window move and/or resize.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SendToModule FvwmProxy Redo <br>
Attempt to redo the most recent Undo. If another move or
resize occurs since the previous undo, the redo buffer will
be cleared.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SAMPLE CONFIGURATION <br>
The following are excerpts from a .fvwm2rc file which
describe FvwmProxy initialization commands:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Key Tab A M SendToModule
FvwmProxy Circulate ScanForWindow East South (CurrentPage)
<br>
Key Tab A SM SendToModule FvwmProxy Circulate ScanForWindow
West North (CurrentPage)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmProxy: Action
ModifierRelease M SendToModule FvwmProxy Hide</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">But Meta-Shift-Tab can be
awkward, so Meta-Q may be a better alternative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Key Q A M SendToModule FvwmProxy
Circulate ScanForWindow West North (CurrentPage)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You might consider adding
!Sticky to the (CurrentPage) conditional if you use Sticky
for low-interactivity programs, like load meters and music
players.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To have the proxies immediately
pop up when you hold the Alt key, add</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Key Meta_L A N SendToModule
FvwmProxy Show</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If that&rsquo;s too intrusive,
you can assign Alt-Esc to switch the proxies on and off by
adding</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Key Escape A M SendToModule
FvwmProxy ShowToggle</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some platforms have problems
where general Alt key combinations becoming otherwise
dysfunctional after defining these mappings. If this
happens, it might be difficult to take <br>
full advantage of this module.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To have the mouse jump to the
center instead of the upper left corner, try adding</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AddToFunc WindowListFunc <br>
+ I WarpToWindow 50 50</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or just make your own list
function from scratch, for example</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DestroyFunc WindowListFunc <br>
AddToFunc WindowListFunc <br>
+ I WindowId $[w.id] Raise <br>
+ I WindowId $[w.id] WarpToWindow 50 50</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the default
configuration does not activate any Next/Prev operations for
Alt-Tab since that sequence is, by default, used by another
module. Adding appropriate key <br>
mappings to your .fvwm2rc will switch this responsibility to
FvwmProxy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you use ProxyIconified, you
might consider adding Iconify actions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AddToFunc WindowListFunc <br>
+ I WindowId $[w.id] Iconify Off</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AddToFunc Raise-and-Deiconify
<br>
+ I WindowId $[w.id] Raise <br>
+ I WindowId $[w.id] Iconify Off</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmProxy: Action Click1
Raise-and-Deiconify <br>
*FvwmProxy: Action Click2 Iconify</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can set up some basic slots
fairly easily.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmProxy: GroupSlot 2 <br>
*FvwmProxy: GroupCount 5</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmProxy: SlotStyle 1 MiniIcon
<br>
*FvwmProxy: SlotStyle 7 Pixmap &quot;squeeze.xpm&quot; <br>
*FvwmProxy: SlotStyle 8 Pixmap &quot;mini-up.xpm&quot; <br>
*FvwmProxy: SlotStyle 9 Pixmap &quot;mini-bball.xpm&quot;
<br>
*FvwmProxy: SlotStyle 10 Pixmap
&quot;mini-cross.xpm&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmProxy: SlotAction 1 Click1
Popup WindowMenu <br>
*FvwmProxy: SlotAction 7 Click1 SendToModule FvwmProxy
IsolateToggle <br>
*FvwmProxy: SlotAction 8 Click1 SendToModule FvwmProxy
SoftToggle <br>
*FvwmProxy: SlotAction 9 Click1 Iconify <br>
*FvwmProxy: SlotAction 10 Click1 Delete</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In this example, WindowMenu is
something you would have to define. If your proxy width is
too small, some slots can get cut off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Undo and redo can be easily
mapped to any keys.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Key Z A 3 SendToModule FvwmProxy
Undo <br>
Key R A 3 SendToModule FvwmProxy Redo</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can rotate through an
isolated group using any keys. For example, meta cursor-up
and cursor-down could traverse the group.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Key Up A 3 SendToModule
FvwmProxy PrevIsolated <br>
Key Down A 3 SendToModule FvwmProxy NextIsolated</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A somewhat impractical example
of a group definition using GIMP is as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmProxy: Group
&quot;GIMP&quot; Include &quot;The GIMP&quot; <br>
*FvwmProxy: Group &quot;GIMP&quot; Include &quot;Module
Manager&quot; <br>
*FvwmProxy: Group &quot;GIMP&quot; SoftInclude &quot;Unit
Editor&quot; <br>
*FvwmProxy: Group &quot;GIMP&quot; AutoInclude <br>
*FvwmProxy: Group &quot;GIMP&quot; AutoSoft <br>
*FvwmProxy: Group &quot;GIMP&quot; Exclude
&quot;Preferences&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This sets up a hard attachment
between the windows &quot;The GIMP&quot; and &quot;Module
Manager&quot;. The &quot;Unit Editor&quot; is also in the
group, but only responds to movement of one of the hard <br>
inclusions. Any window in the same process or with the same
client leader is also associated, but they default to soft
inclusion, except &quot;Preferences&quot; which is
explicitly <br>
excluded. Note that in this case, the explicit soft
inclusion of &quot;Unit Editor&quot; is redundant with the
combination of AutoInclude and AutoSoft. However, if
AutoSoft was not spec&acirc; <br>
ified, the explicit SoftInclude would distinguish that
pattern from the otherwise hard inclusion under just
AutoInclude.</p>
