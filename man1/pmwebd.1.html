<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pmwebd - web access to PCP</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pmwebd [-p port] [-4] [-6] [-t timeout] [-R resdir] [-c
number] [-h hostname] [-a archive] [-P] [-L] [-N] [-G] [-X]
[-i min-interval] [-I [-K spec] [-A archivesdir] [-S] [-l
log&acirc; <br>
file] [-U username] [-x file] [-v] [-?]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
pmwebd is a network daemon that binds a subset of the
Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) client API (PMAPI(3)) to RESTful
web applications using the HTTP (PMWEBAPI(3)) protocol. Web
<br>
clients request a URI with the prefix /pmapi to access the
bindings. pmwebd creates PCP contexts as requested by a
dynamic pool of remote clients, and maintains them as long
as <br>
the clients regularly reconnect to request PMAPI operations.
Otherwise, PCP contexts are closed after a timeout.
Permanent contexts may be requested on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition to the API binding,
pmwebd may be optionally configured as a simple HTTP file
server, in order to feed the web application itself to a web
browser. URIs not matching <br>
the /pmapi prefix are mapped to files under the configured
resource directory, if the -R option was given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition, pmwebd may be
optionally configured as a server of a subset of the
graphite 0.9.12 web API, for URLs with the /graphite prefix,
in order to expose PCP archives to <br>
interactive data-graphing web applications.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The options to pmwebd are as
follows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p port <br>
Set the TCP port number on which pmwebd will listen for HTTP
requests. The default is 44323.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-4 or -6 <br>
Listen only on IPv4 or IPv6. By default, pmwebd will listen
on both protocols, if possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A archdir <br>
Limit remote access to archives to only those beneath the
given directory. By default, only files beneath the initial
pmwebd working directory may be accessed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R resdir <br>
Activate file serving beneath the given resource directory.
All regular files there may be read and transcribed to
remote clients. By default, file serving is disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-G Activate servicing of a
subset of the graphite webapi. This exposes all PCP archives
under the -A directory to remote clients. By default,
graphite webapi serving is <br>
disabled. To use the graphite and/or grafana web
applications included with pmwebd, use both -G and -R, and
connect your web browser to http://127.0.0.1:43323/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X Disable encoding of common
characters for metric names, which allows shorter graphite
metric names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i min-interval <br>
Set the minimum sampling interval for graphite time series
in seconds. The default is 60. Smaller values give higher
precision (but not necessarily accuracy) data, but <br>
may cost extra processing time at pmwebd or the web browser;
and vice versa.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I Attempt to open an entire
directory as an archive when traversing the -A DIR paths to
serve graphite-api metrics. If successful, it can make the
metric names much shorter <br>
(omitting individual encoded file names) and span across
time. If the attempt fails, pmwebd will recurse to each
individual archive file, just as though -I were not
giv&acirc; <br>
en. The difference is that if the -I attempt succeeds, a
subdirectory is not recursed further, so if any other
archives or subdirectories are present, they won&rsquo;t be
ex&acirc; <br>
posed to graphite-api clients.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t timeout <br>
Set the maximum timeout (in seconds) after the last
operation on a pmapi web context, before it is closed by
pmwebd. A smaller timeout may be requested by the web
client.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c number <br>
Reset the next PMWEBAPI permanent context identifier as
given. The default is 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h hostname or -a archive or -L
<br>
Assign the next permanent PMWEBAPI context identifier to a
PMAPI connection to the given host (with an extended syntax
as given in PCPIntro(1)), or archive file, or the <br>
PM_CONTEXT_LOCAL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P Run in permissive mode,
allowing Unix domain socket connections and/or local PMDA
contexts. By default these are not allowed due to the
automatic authentication that is <br>
performed on the server in these modes. Only enable this
option if you understand the risks involved, and are sure
that all remote pmwebd accesses will be from benevolent <br>
users. If enabled, unauthenticated remote PMWEBAPI(3)
clients will be able to access potentially sensitive
performance metric values which an unauthenticated PMAPI(3)
<br>
client usually would not be able to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N Disable creation of new
PMWEBAPI contexts via HTTP requests, leaving only permanent
ones accessible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-K spec <br>
When fetching metrics from a local context, the -K option
may be used to control the DSO PMDAs that should be made
accessible. The spec argument conforms to the syntax <br>
described in __pmSpecLocalPMDA(3). More than one -K option
may be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l logfile <br>
By default, logging goes to standard output/error file
handles. The verbosity flag -v affects the amount of
traffic. The -l option causes the log file to be written to
<br>
logfile instead. If the log file cannot be created or is not
writable, output is written to the standard error
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U username <br>
If invoked as root, assume the identity of username before
starting to accept incoming requests from web clients.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S Disable service
advertisement. By default, pmwebd will advertise its
presence on the network using any available mechanisms (such
as Avahi/DNS-SD), assisting remote moni&acirc; <br>
toring tools with finding it. These mechanisms are disabled
with this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x file <br>
Before the pmwebd logfile can be opened, pmwebd may
encounter a fatal error which prevents it from starting. By
default, the output describing this error is sent to <br>
/dev/tty but it may redirected to file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Increase the verbosity of the
pmwebd program as it logs to its standard output/error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-? Show pmwebd invocation help
and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SECURITY <br>
The current release of pmwebd is suitable for direct
exposure to trusted networks only, due to several security
limitations. Most or all of these limitations may be worked
<br>
around by use of a web application firewall (for example, an
Apache HTTPD proxy), which would add the constraints and
capabilities absent within pmwebd. Such configuration is
<br>
beyond the scope of this document.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">encryption/confidentiality <br>
The pmwebd program is does not currently support HTTPS
(SSL/TLS), so the HTTP traffic is not protected against
network-level attacks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">authentication <br>
The PMAPI layer does not possess a mandatory authentication
mechanism, so any remote connection can access any metric
exposed by suchly connected PMAPI contexts. However, <br>
a new host-context string may use authentication clauses of
the longer host URLs, for example
pcps://hostname?method=plain&amp;user=userid&amp;pass=password.
Use of resulting <br>
pmwebapi contexts later requires matching HTTP PLAIN
authentication; see below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">inbound admission control <br>
The pmwebd program does not impose access control on the
origin or rate of its incoming requests. It may be possible
for some clients to starve others.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">outbound admission control <br>
The pmwebd program does not impose access control on
outbound connections when a new PMAPI context is created for
a PMCD. (Without the -P option, connections to
UNIX-do&acirc; <br>
main / local PMCDs are blocked.) This enables hypothetical
use of a pmwebd instance to be used as a network
proxy/scanner. For an archive type context, the files must
be <br>
located under the pmwebd current directory, or another
directory specified by -A. One may entirely disable remotely
specified PMAPI context creation using the -N option; <br>
in this case, specify a static set of contexts using the -h,
-a, and/or -L options. You may assign them arbitrary context
numbers with the -c option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">context ownership <br>
Authenticated PCP contexts are protected by requiring the
same HTTP PLAIN/simple userid/password credentials for
related /pmapi requests. However, unauthenticated con&acirc;
<br>
texts for different web clients are kept distinct only by
the assignment of large pseudorandom identifiers. It may be
possible to find these by brute-force search or oth&acirc;
<br>
er techniques, thereby letting a web client impersonate
another. For more privacy of the permanent contexts, use the
-c option to reset their starting web context identi&acirc;
<br>
fiers to a number much different from 1. On the other hand,
context ownership is not that precious, since there exist no
state-destructive operations for them, except <br>
perhaps metric store or instance profile settings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STARTING AND STOPPING PMWEBD
<br>
The pmwebd server may be started automatically at boot time
and stopped when the system is being brought down. Users may
also run customized pmwebd instances (under separate -p <br>
PORT numbers), for example for their own archive farms. For
management fo the system pmwebd, become superuser and
type</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># $PCP_RC_DIR/pmwebd start</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">to start pmwebd, or</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># $PCP_RC_DIR/pmwebd stop</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">to stop pmwebd. Starting pmwebd
when it is already running is the same as stopping it and
then starting it again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
$PCP_PMWEBDOPTIONS_PATH <br>
command line options and environment variable settings for
pmwebd when launched from $PCP_RC_DIR/pmwebd This file is
interpreted as a Bourne Shell script, expecting vari&acirc;
<br>
able settings of the form &quot;OPTIONS=value&quot; and
possibly others. <br>
$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmwebd/pmwebd.log <br>
Log file for system pmwebd service. <br>
$PCP_LOG_DIR <br>
Default directory for -A option: a base directory containing
PCP archives. <br>
$PCP_SHARE_DIR/webapps <br>
Default directory for -R option: a base directory containing
web applications.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PCP ENVIRONMENT <br>
Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP. On
each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local
<br>
values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF variable may be
used to specify an alternative configuration file, as
described in pcp.conf(5).</p>
