<p>XMODMAP(1) General Commands Manual XMODMAP(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
xmodmap - utility for modifying keymaps and pointer button
mappings in X</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
xmodmap [-options ...] [filename]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The xmodmap program is used to edit and display the keyboard
modifier map and keymap table that are used by client
applications to convert event keycodes into keysyms. It is
<br>
usually run from the user&rsquo;s session startup script to
configure the keyboard according to personal tastes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The following options may be used with xmodmap:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-display display <br>
This option specifies the host and display to use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-help This option indicates that
a brief description of the command line arguments should be
printed on the standard error channel. This will be done
whenever an unhandled <br>
argument is given to xmodmap.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-grammar <br>
This option indicates that a help message describing the
expression grammar used in files and with -e expressions
should be printed on the standard error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-verbose <br>
This option indicates that xmodmap should print logging
information as it parses its input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-quiet This option turns off the
verbose logging. This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n This option indicates that
xmodmap should not change the mappings, but should display
what it would do, like make(1) does when given this
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e expression <br>
This option specifies an expression to be executed. Any
number of expressions may be specified from the command
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pm This option indicates that
the current modifier map should be printed on the standard
output. This is the default mode of operation if no other
mode options are speci&acirc; <br>
fied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pk This option indicates that
the current keymap table should be printed on the standard
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pke This option indicates that
the current keymap table should be printed on the standard
output in the form of expressions that can be fed back to
xmodmap.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pp This option indicates that
the current pointer map should be printed on the standard
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- A lone dash means that the
standard input should be used as the input file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The filename specifies a file
containing xmodmap expressions to be executed. This file is
usually kept in the user&rsquo;s home directory with a name
like .xmodmaprc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXPRESSION GRAMMAR <br>
The xmodmap program reads a list of expressions and parses
them all before attempting to execute any of them. This
makes it possible to refer to keysyms that are being
redefined <br>
in a natural way without having to worry as much about name
conflicts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The list of keysym names may be
found in the header file &lt;X11/keysymdef.h&gt; (without
the XK_ prefix), supplemented by the keysym database
/usr/share/X11/XKeysymDB. Keysyms <br>
matching Unicode characters may be specified as
&quot;U0020&quot; to &quot;U007E&quot; and &quot;U00A0&quot;
to &quot;U10FFFF&quot; for all possible Unicode
characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">keycode NUMBER = KEYSYMNAME ...
<br>
The list of keysyms is assigned to the indicated keycode
(which may be specified in decimal, hex or octal and can be
determined by running the xev program). Up to eight <br>
keysyms may be attached to a key, however the last four are
not used in any major X server implementation. The first
keysym is used when no modifier key is pressed in <br>
conjunction with this key, the second with Shift, the third
when the Mode_switch key is used with this key and the
fourth when both the Mode_switch and Shift keys are <br>
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">keycode any = KEYSYMNAME ...
<br>
If no existing key has the specified list of keysyms
assigned to it, a spare key on the keyboard is selected and
the keysyms are assigned to it. The list of keysyms may <br>
be specified in decimal, hex or octal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">keysym KEYSYMNAME = KEYSYMNAME
... <br>
The KEYSYMNAME on the left hand side is translated into
matching keycodes used to perform the corresponding set of
keycode expressions. Note that if the same keysym is <br>
bound to multiple keys, the expression is executed for each
matching keycode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">clear MODIFIERNAME <br>
This removes all entries in the modifier map for the given
modifier, where valid name are: Shift, Lock, Control, Mod1,
Mod2, Mod3, Mod4, and Mod5 (case does not matter in <br>
modifier names, although it does matter for all other
names). For example, &lsquo;&lsquo;clear Lock&rsquo;&rsquo;
will remove all any keys that were bound to the shift lock
modifier.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">add MODIFIERNAME = KEYSYMNAME
... <br>
This adds all keys containing the given keysyms to the
indicated modifier map. The keysym names are evaluated after
all input expressions are read to make it easy to <br>
write expressions to swap keys (see the EXAMPLES
section).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">remove MODIFIERNAME = KEYSYMNAME
... <br>
This removes all keys containing the given keysyms from the
indicated modifier map. Unlike add, the keysym names are
evaluated as the line is read in. This allows you <br>
to remove keys from a modifier without having to worry about
whether or not they have been reassigned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pointer = default <br>
This sets the pointer map back to its default settings
(button 1 generates a code of 1, button 2 generates a 2,
etc.).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pointer = NUMBER ... <br>
This sets the pointer map to contain the indicated button
codes. The list always starts with the first physical
button. Setting a button code to 0 disables events from <br>
that button.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Lines that begin with an
exclamation point (!) are taken as comments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to change the
binding of a modifier key, you must also remove it from the
appropriate modifier map.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Many pointers are designed such that the first button is
pressed using the index finger of the right hand. People who
are left-handed frequently find that it is more comfortable
<br>
to reverse the button codes that get generated so that the
primary button is pressed using the index finger of the left
hand. This could be done on a 3 button pointer as fol&acirc;
<br>
lows: <br>
% xmodmap -e &quot;pointer = 3 2 1&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Many applications support the
notion of Meta keys (similar to Control keys except that
Meta is held down instead of Control). However, some servers
do not have a Meta keysym in <br>
the default keymap table, so one needs to be added by hand.
The following command will attach Meta to the Multi-language
key (sometimes labeled Compose Character). It also <br>
takes advantage of the fact that applications that need a
Meta key simply need to get the keycode and don&rsquo;t
require the keysym to be in the first column of the keymap
table. <br>
This means that applications that are looking for a
Multi_key (including the default modifier map) won&rsquo;t
notice any change. <br>
% xmodmap -e &quot;keysym Multi_key = Multi_key
Meta_L&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Similarly, some keyboards have
an Alt key but no Meta key. In that case the following may
be useful: <br>
% xmodmap -e &quot;keysym Alt_L = Meta_L Alt_L&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One of the more simple, yet
convenient, uses of xmodmap is to set the keyboard&rsquo;s
&quot;rubout&quot; key to generate an alternate keysym. This
frequently involves exchanging Backspace with <br>
Delete to be more comfortable to the user. If the ttyModes
resource in xterm is set as well, all terminal emulator
windows will use the same key for erasing characters: <br>
% xmodmap -e &quot;keysym BackSpace = Delete&quot; <br>
% echo &quot;XTerm*ttyModes: erase ^?&quot; | xrdb
-merge</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some keyboards do not
automatically generate less than and greater than characters
when the comma and period keys are shifted. This can be
remedied with xmodmap by resetting the <br>
bindings for the comma and period with the following
scripts: <br>
! <br>
! make shift-, be &lt; and shift-. be &gt; <br>
! <br>
keysym comma = comma less <br>
keysym period = period greater</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One of the more irritating
differences between keyboards is the location of the Control
and CapsLock keys. A common use of xmodmap is to swap these
two keys as follows: <br>
! <br>
! Swap Caps_Lock and Control_L <br>
! <br>
remove Lock = Caps_Lock <br>
remove Control = Control_L <br>
keysym Control_L = Caps_Lock <br>
keysym Caps_Lock = Control_L <br>
add Lock = Caps_Lock <br>
add Control = Control_L</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This example can be run again to
swap the keys back to their previous assignments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The keycode command is useful
for assigning the same keysym to multiple keycodes. Although
unportable, it also makes it possible to write scripts that
can reset the keyboard to <br>
a known state. The following script sets the backspace key
to generate Delete (as shown above), flushes all existing
caps lock bindings, makes the CapsLock key be a control key,
<br>
make F5 generate Escape, and makes Break/Reset be a shift
lock. <br>
! <br>
! On the HP, the following keycodes have key caps as listed:
<br>
! <br>
! 101 Backspace <br>
! 55 Caps <br>
! 14 Ctrl <br>
! 15 Break/Reset <br>
! 86 Stop <br>
! 89 F5 <br>
! <br>
keycode 101 = Delete <br>
keycode 55 = Control_R <br>
clear Lock <br>
add Control = Control_R <br>
keycode 89 = Escape <br>
keycode 15 = Caps_Lock <br>
add Lock = Caps_Lock</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
DISPLAY to get default host and display number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
X(7), xev(1), setxkbmap(1), XStringToKeysym(3), Xlib
documentation on key and pointer events</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Every time a keycode expression is evaluated, the server
generates a MappingNotify event on every client. This can
cause some thrashing. All of the changes should be batched
<br>
together and done at once. Clients that receive keyboard
input and ignore MappingNotify events will not notice any
changes made to keyboard mappings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Xmodmap should generate
&quot;add&quot; and &quot;remove&quot; expressions
automatically whenever a keycode that is already bound to a
modifier is changed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There should be a way to have
the remove expression accept keycodes as well as keysyms for
those times when you really mess up your mappings.</p>
