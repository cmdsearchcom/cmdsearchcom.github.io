<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
gmtswitch - Switching between different GMT versions</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
gmtswitch [ D | version ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INTRODUCTION <br>
gmtswitch helps you modify your environment to allow for the
switching back and forth between several installed GMT
versions, in particular GMT 5 and versions from the GMT 4
<br>
series. It works by maintaining a list of directories to GMT
installations in a file in your home directory, then
manipulates a symbolic link to point to the GMT directory
whose <br>
executables we wish to use [The Windows version works a bit
differently; see WINDOWS below].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REQUIRED ARGUMENTS <br>
None. If no arguments are given you are presented with a
menu of installed GMT versions from 1 to n and you specify
which one you wish to switch to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS <br>
D Select the default GMT version. This is the first entry in
the ~/.gmtversions file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">version <br>
Search for a unique match in the ~/.gmtversions file. If one
match is found we switch to that entry; otherwise an error
is generated. where module is the name of a GMT <br>
program and the options are those that pertain to that
particular program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SETUP <br>
If you have official versions installed then running
gmtswitch the very first time will examine your hard disk
starting at / and look for directories with GMT4 or GMT5 in
the <br>
name. This will fail to find the subversion directories and
possibly others you have placed elsewhere. The fastest way
to get up and running is this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Edit/Create ~/.gmtversions and
add the paths to all GMT installations <br>
you have or care to consider. Each path goes on separate
lines and points to the top dir of each distribution, e.g.,
/Users/pwessel/UH/RESEARCH/PROJECTS/GMTdev/GMT4.5.7</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In your .bashrc or .[t]csrh or
wherever you are maintaining your PATH <br>
or path variable, remove any directories you have added that
contain GMT, and add the new path $HOME/this_gmt/bin (might
be $home for csh users). Make sure this path <br>
appears before any others that might contain a GMT
installation, such as those used by package managers (e.g.,
/sw/bin for fink, /opt/local/bin for Macports, etc.).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. Make the new path take effect
(quit/restart terminal, logout/login, etc).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cd to the most recent GMT
directory where a gmtswitch version lives, <br>
and run gmtswitch with no argument. Select one of the
version from the menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5. If in csh you may have to say
rehash afterwards.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Type &acirc;psxy -&acirc; and
the synopsis should tell you that you got the <br>
correct version. You can now run gmtswitch from anywhere;
try it out and make sure that you can switch between the
versions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
To switch to GMT version 4.5.7 (assuming it was installed as
such and not via a package manager), try <br>
gmtswitch GMT4.5.7</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To switch to the default (your
top choice), do <br>
gmtswitch D</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, to select from the
menu, just run <br>
gmtswitch</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and pick the one you want.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BEWARE <br>
GMT remembers where it was installed the first time and uses
that dir to find the default GMT share directory. If you
move entire GMT installation after compilation then you may
<br>
have to set GMT_SHAREDIR to point to the top dir in order
for things to work. It is best not to move things after
installation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WINDOWS <br>
Under Windows use gmtswitch.bat which is a batch script that
changes the Windows PATH variable so that the BIN directory
of the preferred version always comes first. To do that <br>
the batch works in two alternative modes:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 - Permanent mode</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 - Temporary mode</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The permanent mode makes use of
the free executable program &acirc;EditPath&acirc; to change
the user path in the registry. It&acirc;s called permanent
because the changes remains until &acirc;&brvbar; next <br>
change. See</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">http://www.softpedia.com/get/Tweak/Registry-Tweak/EditPath.shtml</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Of course the editpath.exe
binary must be in your system&acirc;s path as well. WARNING:
The path change will not be visible on the shell cmd where
it was executed. For the change to <br>
be active you will need to open a new cmd window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The second mode is temporary
because the path to the selected GMT binary dir is prepended
to the previous path via a shell command line. This
modification disappears when the <br>
shell cmd window where it was executes is deleted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is the user responsibility to
set the contents of the G32_32 to G5_64 below to valid paths
where the binaries of the different GMT versions are
installed Note that it is not <br>
mandatory to have all four of them in you computer. For the
ones you do not have just let them pointing to nothing
e.g.,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set G4_64=</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The permanent mode is the
default one (but this can be changed. See edit section) To
run in the temporary mode just give a second argument
(doesn&acirc;t matter what)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example usage to set a GMT5 64
bits permanent</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gmtswitch g5_64</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To temporary set a GMT4 32 bits
do</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gmtswitch g4_32 1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Run without arguments to get a
&acirc;Usage&acirc; (for permanent mode)</p>
