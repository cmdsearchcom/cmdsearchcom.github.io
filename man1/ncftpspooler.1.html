<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ncftpspooler - Global batch FTP job processor daemon</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ncftpspooler -d [options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ncftpspooler -l [options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Command line flags: <br>
-d Begin background processing of FTP jobs in the designated
FTP job queue directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q XX Use this option to specify
a directory to use as the FTP job queue instead of the
default directory, /var/spool/ncftp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o XX Use this option to specify
a filename to use as the log file. By default, (and rather
inappropriately) the program simply uses a file called log
in the job queue direc&acirc; <br>
tory. If you don&rsquo;t want a log, use this option to
specify /dev/null.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l Lists the contents of the job
queue directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s XX When the job queue is
empty, the program sleeps 120 seconds and then checks again
to see if a new job has been submitted. Use this option to
change the number of seconds <br>
used for this delay.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The ncftpspooler program evolved from the ncftpbatch
program. The ncftpbatch program was originally designed as a
&lsquo;&lsquo;personal FTP spooler&rsquo;&rsquo; which would
process a single back&acirc; <br>
ground job a particular user and exit when it finished; the
ncftpspooler program is a &lsquo;&lsquo;global FTP
spooler&rsquo;&rsquo; which stays running and processes
background jobs as they are submit&acirc; <br>
ted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The job queue directory is
monitored for specially-named and formatted text files. Each
file serves as a single FTP job. The name of the job file
contains the type of FTP job <br>
(get or put), a timestamp indicating the earliest the job
should be processed, and optionally some additional
information to make it easier to create unique job files
(i.e. a <br>
sequence number). The contents of the job files have
information such as the remote server machine to FTP to,
username, password, remote pathname, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Your job queue directory must be
readable and writable by the user that you plan to run
ncftpspooler as, so that jobs can be removed or renamed
within the queue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">More importantly, the user that
is running the program will need adequate privileges to
access the local files that are involved in the FTPing.
I.e., if your spooler is going to <br>
be processing jobs which upload files to remote servers,
then the user will need read permission on the local files
that will be uploaded (and directory access permission the
<br>
parent directories). Likewise, if your spooler is going to
be processing jobs which download files, then the user would
need to be able to write to the local directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once you have created your spool
directory with appropriate permissions and ownerships, you
can run ncftpspooler -d to launch the spooler daemon. You
can run additional spoolers <br>
if you want to process more than FTP job from the same job
queue directory simultaneously. You can then monitor the log
file (i.e., using tail -f ) to track the progress of the
<br>
spooler. Most of the time it won&rsquo;t be doing anything,
unless job files have appeared in the job queue
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">JOB FILE NAMES <br>
When the ncftpspooler program monitors the job queue
directory, it ignores any files that do not follow the
naming convention for job files. The job files must be
prefixed in <br>
the format of X-YYYYMMDD-hhmmss where X denotes a job type,
YYYY is the four-digit year, MM is the two-digit month
number, DD is the two-digit day of the month, hh is the two-
<br>
digit hour of the day (00-23), mm is the two-digit minute,
and ss is the two-digit second. The date and time represent
the earliest time you want the job to be run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The job type can be g for a get
(download from remote host), or p for aput (upload to remote
host).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As an example, if you wanted to
schedule an upload to occur at 11:45 PM on December 7, 2001,
a job file could be named</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">p-20011207-234500</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In practice, the job files
include additional information such as a sequence number or
process ID. This makes it easier to create unique job file
names. Here is the same exam&acirc; <br>
ple, with a process ID and a sequence number:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">p-20011207-234500-1234-2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When submitting job files to the
queue directory, be sure to use a dash character after the
hhmmss field if you choose to append any additional data to
the job file name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">JOB FILE CONTENTS <br>
Job files are ordinary text files, so that they can be
created by hand. Each line of the file is a key-pair in the
format variable=value, or is a comment line beginning with
an <br>
octothorpe character (#), or is a blank line. Here is an
example job file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># This is a NcFTP spool file
entry. <br>
job-name=g-20011016-100656-008299-1 <br>
op=get <br>
hostname=ftp.freebsd.org <br>
xtype=I <br>
passive=1 <br>
remote-dir=pub/FreeBSD <br>
local-dir=/tmp <br>
remote-file=README.TXT <br>
local-file=readme.txt</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Job files are flexible since
they follow an easy-to-use format and do not have many
requirements, but there are a few mandatory parameters that
must appear for the spooler to be <br>
able to process the job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">op The operation (job type) to
perform. Valid values are get and put.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hostname <br>
The remote host to FTP to. This may be an IP address or a
DNS name (i.e. ftp.example.com).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For a regular get job, these
parameters are required:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">remote-file <br>
The pathname of the file to download from the remote
server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">local-file <br>
The pathname to use on the local server for the downloaded
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For a regular put job, these
parameters are required:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">local-file <br>
The pathname of the file to upload to the remote server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">remote-file <br>
The pathname to use on the remote server for the uploaded
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For a recursive get job, these
parameters are required:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">remote-file <br>
The pathname of the file or directory to download from the
remote server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">local-dir <br>
The directory pathname to use on the local server to contain
the downloaded items.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For a recursive put job, these
parameters are required:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">local-file <br>
The pathname of the file or directory to upload to the
remote server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">remote-dir <br>
The directory pathname to use on the remote server to
contain the uploaded items.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The rest of the parameters are
optional. The spooler will attempt to use reasonable
defaults for these parameters if necessary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">user The username to use to
login to the remote server. Defaults to
&lsquo;&lsquo;anonymous&rsquo;&rsquo; for guest access.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pass The password to use in
conjunction with the username to login to the remote
server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">acct The account to use in
conjunction with the username to login to the remote server.
The need to specify this parameter is extremely rare.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">port The port number to use in
conjunction with the remote hostname to connect to the
remote server. Defaults to the standard FTP port number,
21.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">host-ip The IP address to use in
conjunction with the remote hostname to connect to the
remote server. This parameter can be used in place of the
hostname parameter, but one or <br>
the other must be used. This parameter is commonly included
along with the hostname parameter as supplemental
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xtype The transfer type to use.
Defaults to binary transfer type (TYPE I). Valid values are
I for binary, A for ASCII text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">passive Whether to use FTP
passive data connections (PASV) or FTP active data
connections (PORT). Valid values are 0 for active, 1 for
passive, or 2 to try passive, then fall&acirc; <br>
back to active. The default is 2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">recursive <br>
This can be used to transfer entire directory trees. By
default, only a single file is transferred. Valid values are
yes or no.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">delete This can be used to
delete the source file on the source machine after
successfully transferring the file to the destination
machine. By default, source files are not <br>
deleted. Valid values are yes or no.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">job-name <br>
This isn&rsquo;t used by the program, but can be used by an
entity which is automatically generating job files. As an
example, when using the -bbb flag with ncftpput, it
cre&acirc; <br>
ates a job file on stdout with a job-name parameter so you
can easily copy the file to the job queue directory with the
suggested job name as the job file name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pre-ftp-command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">post-ftp-command <br>
These parameters correspond to the -W, and -Y options of
ncftpget and ncftpput. It is important to note that these
refer to RFC959 File Transfer Protocol commands and <br>
not shell commands, nor commands used from within
/usr/bin/ftp or ncftp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pre-shell-command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">post-shell-command <br>
These parameters provide hooks so you can run a custom
program when an item is processed by the spooler. Valid
values are pathnames to scripts or executable programs. <br>
Note that the value must not contain any command-line
arguments -- if you want to do that, create a shell script
and have it run your program with the command-line
argu&acirc; <br>
ments it requires.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Generally speaking,
post-shell-command is much more useful than
pre-shell-command since if you need to use these options
you&rsquo;re more likely to want to do something after the
FTP <br>
transfer has completed rather than before. For example, you
might want to run a shell script which pages an
administrator to notify her that her 37 gigabyte file
download has <br>
completed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When your custom program is run,
it receives on standard input the contents of the job file
(i.e. several lines of variable=value key-pairs), as well as
additional data the <br>
spooler may provide, such as a result key-pair with a
textual description of the job&rsquo;s completion
status.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">post-shell-command update a log
file named /var/log/ncftp_spooler.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#!/usr/bin/perl -w</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">my ($line); <br>
my (%params) = ();</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">while (defined($line =
&lt;STDIN&gt;)) { <br>
$params{$1} = $2 <br>
if ($line =~ /^([^= }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if
((defined($params{&quot;result&quot;})) &amp;&amp; <br>
($params{&quot;result&quot;} =~ /^Succeeded/)) <br>
{ <br>
open(LOG, &quot;&gt;&gt; /var/log/ncftp_spooler.log&quot;)
<br>
or exit(1); <br>
print LOG &quot;DOWNLOAD&quot; if ($params{&quot;op&quot;}
eq &quot;get&quot;); <br>
print LOG &quot;UPLOAD&quot; if ($params{&quot;op&quot;} eq
&quot;put&quot;); <br>
print LOG &quot; &quot;, $params{&quot;local-file&quot;},
&quot;0; <br>
close(LOG); <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
The log file should be examined to determine if any
ncftpspooler processes are actively working on jobs. The log
contains copious amounts of useful information, including
the <br>
entire FTP control connection conversation between the FTP
client and server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
The recursive option may not be reliable since ncftpspooler
depends on functionality which may or may not be present in
the remote server software. Additionally, even if the <br>
functionality is available, ncftpspooler may need to use
heuristics which cannot be considered 100% accurate.
Therefore it is best to create individual jobs for each file
in the <br>
directory tree, rather than a single recursive directory
job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For resumption of downloads to
work, the remote server must support the FTP SIZE and MDTM
primitives. Most modern FTP server software can do this, but
there are still a number <br>
of bare-bones ftpd implementations which do not. In these
cases, ncftpspooler will re-download the file in entirety
each time until the download succeeds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The program needs to be improved
to detect jobs that have no chance of ever completing
successfully. There are still a number of cases where jobs
can get spooled but get retried <br>
over and over again until a vigilant sysadmin manually
removes the jobs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The spool files may contain
usernames and passwords stored in cleartext. These files
should not be readable by any user except the user running
the program!</p>
