<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pv - monitor the progress of data through a pipe</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pv [OPTION] [FILE]... <br>
pv [-h|-V]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
pv shows the progress of data through a pipeline by giving
information such as time elapsed, percentage completed (with
progress bar), current throughput rate, total data
trans&acirc; <br>
ferred, and ETA.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To use it, insert it in a
pipeline between two processes, with the appropriate
options. Its standard input will be passed through to its
standard output and progress will be <br>
shown on standard error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pv will copy each supplied FILE
in turn to standard output (- means standard input), or if
no FILEs are specified just standard input is copied. This
is the same behaviour as <br>
cat(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A simple example to watch how
quickly a file is transferred using nc(1):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pv file | nc -w 1 somewhere.com
3000</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A similar example, transferring
a file from another process and passing the expected size to
pv:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cat file | pv -s 12345 | nc -w 1
somewhere.com 3000</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A more complicated example using
numeric output to feed into the dialog(1) program for a
full-screen progress display:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(tar cf - . | pv -n -s $(du -sb
. | awk &rsquo;{print $1}&rsquo;) | gzip -9 &gt; out.tgz)
2&gt;&amp;1 | dialog --gauge &rsquo;Progress&rsquo; 7 70</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Taking an image of a disk,
skipping errors:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pv -EE /dev/sda &gt;
disk-image.img</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Writing an image back to a
disk:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pv disk-image.img &gt;
/dev/sda</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Zeroing a disk:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pv &lt; /dev/zero &gt;
/dev/sda</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that if the input size
cannot be calculated, and the output is a block device, then
the size of the block device will be used and pv will
automatically stop at that size as <br>
if -S had been given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(Linux only): Watching file
descriptor 3 opened by another process 1234:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pv -d 1234:3</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(Linux only): Watching all file
descriptors used by process 1234:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pv -d 1234</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
pv takes many options, which are divided into display
switches, output modifiers, and general options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DISPLAY SWITCHES <br>
If no display switches are specified, pv behaves as if -p,
-t, -e, -r, and -b had been given (i.e. everything except
average rate is switched on). Otherwise, only those display
<br>
types that are explicitly switched on will be shown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, --progress <br>
Turn the progress bar on. If standard input is not a file
and no size was given (with the -s modifier), the progress
bar cannot indicate how close to completion the <br>
transfer is, so it will just move left and right to indicate
that data is moving.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t, --timer <br>
Turn the timer on. This will display the total elapsed time
that pv has been running for.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e, --eta <br>
Turn the ETA timer on. This will attempt to guess, based on
previous transfer rates and the total data size, how long it
will be before completion. This option will have <br>
no effect if the total data size cannot be determined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I, --fineta <br>
Turn the ETA timer on, but display the estimated local time
of arrival instead of time left. When the estimated time is
more than 6 hours in the future, the date is shown <br>
as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, --rate <br>
Turn the rate counter on. This will display the current rate
of data transfer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a, --average-rate <br>
Turn the average rate counter on. This will display the
average rate of data transfer so far.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b, --bytes <br>
Turn the total byte counter on. This will display the total
amount of data transferred so far.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T, --buffer-percent <br>
Turn on the transfer buffer percentage display. This will
show the percentage of the transfer buffer in use - but see
the caveat under %T in the FORMATTING section below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A, --last-written NUM <br>
Show the last NUM bytes written - but see the caveat under
%nA in the FORMATTING section below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F, --format FORMAT <br>
Ignore the options -p, -t, -e, -r, -a, -b, -T, and -A, and
instead use the format string FORMAT to determine the output
format. See the FORMATTING section below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --numeric <br>
Numeric output. Instead of giving a visual indication of
progress, pv will give an integer percentage, one per line,
on standard error, suitable for piping (via convo&acirc;
<br>
luted redirection) into dialog(1). Note that -f is not
required if -n is being used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that if --numeric is in
use, then adding --bytes will cause the number of bytes
processed so far to be output instead of a percentage; if
--line-mode is also in use, <br>
then instead of bytes or a percentage, the number of lines
so far is output. And finally, if --timer is also in use,
then each output line is prefixed with the elapsed <br>
time so far, as a decimal number of seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q, --quiet <br>
No output. Useful if the -L option is being used on its own
to just limit the transfer rate of a pipe.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT MODIFIERS <br>
-W, --wait <br>
Wait until the first byte has been transferred before
showing any progress information or calculating any ETAs.
Useful if the program you are piping to or from requires
<br>
extra information before it starts, eg piping data into
gpg(1) or mcrypt(1) which require a passphrase before data
can be processed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D, --delay-start SEC <br>
Wait until SEC seconds have passed before showing any
progress information, for example in a script where you only
want to show a progress bar if it starts taking a long <br>
time. Note that this can be a decimal such as 0.5.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s SIZE, --size SIZE <br>
Assume the total amount of data to be transferred is SIZE
bytes when calculating percentages and ETAs. The same
suffixes of &quot;k&quot;, &quot;m&quot; etc can be used as
with -L.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Has no effect if used with -d
PID to watch all file descriptors of a process, but will
work with -d PID:FD.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, --line-mode <br>
Instead of counting bytes, count lines (newline characters).
The progress bar will only move when a new line is found,
and the value passed to the -s option will be inter&acirc;
<br>
preted as a line count. Note that file sizes are not
automatically calculated when this option is used, to avoid
having to read all files twice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-0, --null <br>
Count lines as null terminated. This option implies
--line-mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i SEC, --interval SEC <br>
Wait SEC seconds between updates. The default is to update
every second. Note that this can be a decimal such as
0.1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w WIDTH, --width WIDTH <br>
Assume the terminal is WIDTH characters wide, instead of
trying to work it out (or assuming 80 if it cannot be
guessed).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H HEIGHT, --height HEIGHT <br>
Assume the terminal is HEIGHT rows high, instead of trying
to work it out (or assuming 25 if it cannot be guessed).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N NAME, --name NAME <br>
Prefix the output information with NAME. Useful in
conjunction with -c if you have a complicated pipeline and
you want to be able to tell different parts of it apart.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, --force <br>
Force output. Normally, pv will not output any visual
display if standard error is not a terminal. This option
forces it to do so.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --cursor <br>
Use cursor positioning escape sequences instead of just
using carriage returns. This is useful in conjunction with
-N (name) if you are using multiple pv invocations in a <br>
single, long, pipeline.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DATA TRANSFER MODIFIERS <br>
-L RATE, --rate-limit RATE <br>
Limit the transfer to a maximum of RATE bytes per second. A
suffix of &quot;k&quot;, &quot;m&quot;, &quot;g&quot;, or
&quot;t&quot; can be added to denote kilobytes (*1024),
megabytes, and so on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B BYTES, --buffer-size BYTES
<br>
Use a transfer buffer size of BYTES bytes. A suffix of
&quot;k&quot;, &quot;m&quot;, &quot;g&quot;, or
&quot;t&quot; can be added to denote kilobytes (*1024),
megabytes, and so on. The default buffer size is <br>
the block size of the input file&rsquo;s filesystem
multiplied by 32 (512kb max), or 400kb if the block size
cannot be determined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C, --no-splice <br>
Never use splice(2), even if it would normally be possible.
The splice(2) system call is a more efficient way of
transferring data from or to a pipe than regular read(2)
<br>
and write(2), but means that the transfer buffer may not be
used. This prevents -A and -T from working, so if you want
to use -A or -T then you will need to use -C, at <br>
the cost of a small loss in transfer efficiency. (This
option has no effect on systems where splice(2) is
unavailable).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E, --skip-errors <br>
Ignore read errors by attempting to skip past the offending
sections. The corresponding parts of the output will be null
bytes. At first only a few bytes will be <br>
skipped, but if there are many errors in a row then the
skips will move up to chunks of 512. This is intended to be
similar to dd conv=sync,noerror but has not been as <br>
thoroughly tested.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specify -E twice to only report
a read error once per file, instead of reporting each byte
range skipped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S, --stop-at-size <br>
If a size was specified with -s, stop transferring data once
that many bytes have been written, instead of continuing to
the end of input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d PID[:FD], --watchfd PID[:FD]
<br>
Instead of transferring data, watch file descriptor FD of
process PID, and show its progress. The pv process will exit
when FD either changes to a different file, changes <br>
read/write mode, or is closed; other data transfer modifiers
- and remote control - may not be used with this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If only a PID is specified, then
that process will be watched, and all regular files and
block devices it opens will be shown with a progress bar.
The pv process will <br>
exit when process PID exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R PID, --remote PID <br>
If PID is an instance of pv that is already running, -R PID
will cause that instance to act as though it had been given
this instance&rsquo;s command line instead. For example,
<br>
if pv -L 123k is running with process ID 9876, then running
pv -R 9876 -L 321k will cause it to start using a rate limit
of 321k instead of 123k. Note that some options <br>
cannot be changed while running, such as -c, -l, -f, -D, -E,
and -S.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GENERAL OPTIONS <br>
-P FILE, --pidfile FILE <br>
Save the process ID of pv in FILE. The file will be
truncated if it already exists, and will be removed when pv
exits. While pv is running, it will contain a single
num&acirc; <br>
ber - the process ID of pv - followed by a newline.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Print a usage message on standard output and exit
successfully.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
Print version information on standard output and exit
successfully.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FORMATTING <br>
If the -F option is given, then the output format is
determined by the given format string. Within that string,
the following sequences can be used:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%p Progress bar. Expands to fill
the remaining space. Should only be specified once.
Equivalent to -p.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%t Elapsed time. Equivalent to
-t.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%e ETA as time remaining.
Equivalent to -e.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%I ETA as local time of
completion. Equivalent to -I.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%r Current data transfer rate.
Equivalent to -r.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%a Average data transfer rate.
Equivalent to -a.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%b Bytes transferred so far (or
lines if -l was specified). Equivalent to -b.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%T Percentage of the transfer
buffer in use. Equivalent to -T. Shows &quot;{----}&quot; if
the transfer is being done with splice(2), since splicing to
or from pipes does not use the <br>
buffer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%nA Show the last n bytes
written (e.g. %16A for the last 16 bytes). Shows only dots
if the transfer is being done with splice(2), since splicing
to or from pipes does not <br>
use the buffer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%N Name prefix given by -N.
Padded to 9 characters with spaces, and suffixed with :.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%% A single %.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The format string equivalent of
turning on all display switches is &lsquo;%N %b %T %t %r %a
%p %e&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
An exit status of 1 indicates a problem with the -R or -P
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any other exit status is a
bitmask of the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 One or more files could not be
accessed, stat(2)ed, or opened.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4 An input file was the same as
the output file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">8 Internal error with closing a
file or moving to the next file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">16 There was an error while
transferring data from one or more input files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">32 A signal was caught that
caused an early exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">64 Memory allocation failed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A zero exit status indicates no
problems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KNOWN PROBLEMS <br>
The following problems are known to exist in pv:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The -c option does not work
properly on Cygwin without cygserver running, if started
near the bottom of the screen (IPC is needed to handle the
terminal scrolling). To <br>
fix this, start cygserver before using pv -c.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The -R option is not available
on Cygwin without cygserver running (SYSV IPC is needed). To
fix this, start cygserver before running the instance of pv
you want, at run&acirc; <br>
time, to change the parameters of.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you find any other problems,
please report them.</p>
