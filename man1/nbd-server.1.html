<p>NBD-SERVER(1) NBD-SERVER(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
nbd-server - serve a file as a block device to other
computers running the GNU/Linux(tm) or GNU/Hurd Operating
System</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
nbd-server [ip@]port filename [ size ] [ -r ] [ -m ] [ -c ]
[ -l host list filename ] [ -o section name ] [ -C config
file ] [ -M max connections ] [ -V ] [ -d ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
nbd-server is the server for the Linux Network Block Device
(NBD). With NBD, a client can use a file, exported over the
network from a server, as a block device. It can then be
<br>
used for whatever purpose a normal block device (harddisk,
CD-ROM, ...) can be used for.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NBD can be useful for diskless
clients that need swapspace, but you can also create a
filesystem on it and use it as though it were a local
filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nbd-server implements some
security through a file called
&quot;/etc/nbd-server/allow&quot; (by default; a different
file can be chosen with the &rsquo;-l&rsquo; option or
through a config file speci&acirc; <br>
fication). This file must list the IP-addresses or network
masks of clients that are allowed to connect. If it does not
exist, all clients are able to connect. If the file is <br>
empty, no clients can connect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that while the command line
allows for specifying an export, the use of this option is
deprecated. It is preferred to make use of a configuration
file instead, the format of <br>
which is defined in nbd-server(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">While nbd-server is running, new
exports can be added by re-writing configuration files and
then sending SIGHUP to nbd-server. SIGHUP causes nbd-server
to re-read its configura&acirc; <br>
tion files and to start serving all new exports which were
not served earlier. Reconfiguration does not modify any
existing export, it only appends new ones.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
ip The ip address the server should listen on. This may be
an IPv4 address, an IPv6 address, or a hostname. In the
latter case, nbd-server will do a hostname lookup for the
<br>
name specified, and will listen on the first address that is
returned. For compatibility with past versions of
nbd-server, if an IPv4 address is specified, the @ sign that
<br>
serves as separator between the address and port may be
replaced by a colon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this parameter is not
specified, nbd-server will listen on all local addresses on
both IPv4 and IPv6. To limit to IPv4, specify the address as
0.0.0.0; to limit to <br>
IPv6, specify it as ::.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">port The port the server should
listen to. A valid port is any number between 1 and 65536;
if 0 is used, nbd-server will listen on stdin (so that
nbd-server can be ran from <br>
inetd)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">filename <br>
The filename of the file that should be exported. This can
be any file, including &quot;real&quot; blockdevices (i.e. a
file from /dev). If the filename includes the literal string
<br>
&quot;%s&quot;, then this %s will be substituded with the
IP-address of the client trying to connect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">size The size of the block
device at the client side. This is especially useful in
conjunction with the -m option</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can optionally be followed by
one of K,k,M or m, in which case the size will be multiplied
by 1024 (K or k) or 1048576 (M or m)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Export the file read-only. If
a client tries to write to a read-only exported file, it
will receive an error, but the connection will stay up.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m Work with multiple files.
This can be used to export blockdevices that are larger than
the maximum allowed filesize on a given filesystem; i.e.
when the filesystem does <br>
not allow files larger than 2GB (which is true for Linux 2.2
and below), you can use this option to store the data in
multiple files and export a larger filesystem, if <br>
needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To use this option, you must
create a number of files with names in the format
&quot;name.X&quot;, where &quot;name&quot; is given as the
filename argument to nbd-server, and &quot;X&quot; is a
number <br>
starting by 0 and going up for each file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Allowing more flexibility for
this option is planned for future versions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Copy on write. When this
option is provided, write-operations are not done to the
exported file, but to a separate file. This separate file is
removed when the connection <br>
is closed, which means that serving this way will make
nbd-server slow down (especially on large block devices with
lots of writes), and that after disconnecting and <br>
reconnecting the client or the server, all changes are
lost.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C Specify configuration file.
The default configuration file, if this parameter is not
specified, is /etc/nbd-server/config.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the configuration file
is always parsed and the entries in the file used, even if
an extra server is specified on the command line. To disable
the configuration <br>
file entirely, either move it away or use the -C option to
point nbd-server(1) to a non-existing or empty configuration
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also note that if an empty,
incomplete, or invalid configuration file is specified,
nbd-server will produce a warning about failure to parse the
config file. If the com&acirc; <br>
mand line contains a fully specified configuration, this
warning is harmless and may be ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M Specify the maximum number of
opened connections. If this parameter is not specified, no
limit is set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Output the version of
nbd-server, and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Do not fork. Useful for
debugging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">host list filename <br>
This argument should contain a list of IP-addresses for
hosts that may connect to the server. Wildcards are not
allowed. If the file does not exist, it is ignored (and any
<br>
host can connect); If the file does exist, but is empty, no
host can connect. By default, the name
&rsquo;nbd_server.allow&rsquo; is used, and looked for in
the current directory, <br>
unless nbd-server is compiled as a daemon, in which case it
is looked for in the root-directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">section name <br>
If the -o argument is given on the command line, then
nbd-server will output a configuration file section with
this as the header that is functionally equivalent to the
<br>
other options specified on the command line, and exit. This
is useful for migrating pre-2.9 nbd-server initscript
configuration files to the new format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Some examples of nbd-server usage:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; To export a file
/export/nbd/exp-bl-dev on port 2000:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nbd-server 2000
/export/nbd/exp-bl-dev</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; To export a the
same file read-only:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nbd-server 2000
/export/nbd/exp-bl-dev -r</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; To export the
same file read-write, but make sure changes are lost after
restarting the client or the server:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nbd-server 2000
/export/nbd/exp-bl-dev -c</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On The Hurd there is a regular
translator available to perform the client side of the
protocol, and the use of nbd-client is not required. Please
