<p>JODREPORTS(1) General Commands Manual JODREPORTS(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
jodreports - use libjodreports-java directly from the
command line to merge OpenDocument text with data</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
jodreports &lt;template-document&gt; &lt;data-file&gt;
&lt;output-document&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
jodreports is a java program that merge OpenDocument text
with data by using libjodreports-java. The command line tool
is especially useful to test templates while you are adding
<br>
instructions to them. You use a .properties or .xml file to
contain the &lt;data-file&gt; to be merged into the
template. The &lt;template-document&gt; needs to be an
existing OpenDocument <br>
text with simple fields. A field that will be replaced with
the value of a variable passed can be specified using the
standard FreeMarker expression notation by typing the
vari&acirc; <br>
able name into the document as follows</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hi ${name}!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">here name will be replaced with
the value passed in at runtime.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, mixing processing
instructions and normal text into the document may become
confusing and clutter the layout. So JOOReports provides an
alternative way of inserting <br>
fields. You can insert a visual field in OpenOffice.org
Writer from the menu Insert / Fields / Other... (or just
press Ctrl+F2), then click on the Functions tab and select
Input <br>
field. Change the field Reference to JOOScript and in the
following field Content enter the variable name (e.g.
&quot;$name&quot;). This field will typically be displayed
by Writer as a <br>
grayed rectangle with the variable name, while moving the
mouse over it will reveal the field reference.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is a nice way of keeping
processing instructions separate from the document layout
and is thus the recommended approach. Whatever you specify
as the field Reference will be <br>
treated as a FreeMarker ${...} expression, so it could also
be something more complex than a simple variable name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To insert more advanced
instructions, e.g. for conditionally displaying a portion of
text, or repeating a table row for each item in a
collection, you can use FreeMarker direc&acirc; <br>
tives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A simple directive is assign.
You can use it to define a new variable, for example</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[#assign totalPrice = unitPrice
* quantity]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that we always use the
alternative (square bracket) syntax for FreeMarker
directives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">While it may be possible to
insert this directive directly as text into the template,
this does not always work (for reasons we&rsquo;ll see
below) and as mentioned mixing instructions <br>
into the document is a practice we want to avoid anyway. For
this reason, JOOReports lets you insert FreeMarker
directives as scripts. You can insert a script in Writer
from the <br>
menu Insert / Script..., then change the Script type to
JOOScript and insert any FreeMarker directives in the script
Text box. A script will be displayed by Writer as a small
<br>
green rectangle, and you can double click on it to open it
and modify it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">So you directive will be
executed at the point where the script has been inserted.
This is ok for something like assign but as we&rsquo;ll see
will not work for something like list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alternatively, you can insert a
FreeMarker directive in OpenOffice.org Writer from the menu
Insert / Fields / Other... (or just press Ctrl+F2), then
click on the Functions tab <br>
and select Input field. Change the field Reference to
JOOScript and in the following field Content enter the
directive (e.g. &quot;[#assign
title=&rsquo;Mr.&rsquo;]&quot;). Sample Open Document
Tem&acirc; <br>
plate</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Again this provides a nice way
to insert processing instructions and keept them separate
from the document layout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &lt;output-document&gt; is
also an OpenDocument text and will be created as the result
of the merge.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">JOOReports uses FreeMarker as
its template engine.</p>
