<p style="margin-top: 1em">SUMMARY <br>
ab is a tool for benchmarking your Apache Hypertext Transfer
Protocol (HTTP) server. It is designed to give you an
impression of how your current Apache installation performs.
<br>
This especially shows you how many requests per second your
Apache installation is capable of serving.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-A auth-username:password <br>
Supply BASIC Authentication credentials to the server. The
username and password are separated by a single : and sent
on the wire base64 encoded. The string is sent <br>
regardless of whether the server needs it (i.e., has sent an
401 authentication needed).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b windowsize <br>
Size of TCP send/receive buffer, in bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B local-address <br>
Address to bind to when making outgoing connections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c concurrency <br>
Number of multiple requests to perform at a time. Default is
one request at a time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C cookie-name=value <br>
Add a Cookie: line to the request. The argument is typically
in the form of a name=value pair. This field is
repeatable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Do not display the
&quot;percentage served within XX [ms] table&quot;. (legacy
support).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e csv-file <br>
Write a Comma separated value (CSV) file which contains for
each percentage (from 1% to 100%) the time (in milliseconds)
it took to serve that percentage of the requests. <br>
This is usually more useful than the &rsquo;gnuplot&rsquo;
file; as the results are already &rsquo;binned&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f protocol <br>
Specify SSL/TLS protocol (SSL2, SSL3, TLS1, or ALL).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g gnuplot-file <br>
Write all measured values out as a &rsquo;gnuplot&rsquo; or
TSV (Tab separate values) file. This file can easily be
imported into packages like Gnuplot, IDL, Mathematica, Igor
or even <br>
Excel. The labels are on the first line of the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Display usage
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H custom-header <br>
Append extra headers to the request. The argument is
typically in the form of a valid header line, containing a
colon-separated field-value pair (i.e.,
&quot;Accept-Encoding: <br>
zip/zop;8bit&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i Do HEAD requests instead of
GET.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k Enable the HTTP KeepAlive
feature, i.e., perform multiple requests within one HTTP
session. Default is no KeepAlive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n requests <br>
Number of requests to perform for the benchmarking session.
The default is to just perform a single request which
usually leads to non-representative benchmarking
results.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p POST-file <br>
File containing data to POST. Remember to also set -T.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P proxy-auth-username:password
<br>
Supply BASIC Authentication credentials to a proxy en-route.
The username and password are separated by a single : and
sent on the wire base64 encoded. The string is sent <br>
regardless of whether the proxy needs it (i.e., has sent an
407 proxy authentication needed).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q When processing more than 150
requests, ab outputs a progress count on stderr every 10% or
100 requests or so. The -q flag will suppress these
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Don&rsquo;t exit on socket
receive errors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s timeout <br>
Maximum number of seconds to wait before the socket times
out. Default is 30 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S Do not display the median and
standard deviation values, nor display the warning/error
messages when the average and median are more than one or
two times the standard <br>
deviation apart. And default to the min/avg/max values.
(legacy support).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t timelimit <br>
Maximum number of seconds to spend for benchmarking. This
implies a -n 50000 internally. Use this to benchmark the
server within a fixed total amount of time. Per default <br>
there is no timelimit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T content-type <br>
Content-type header to use for POST/PUT data, eg.
application/x-www-form-urlencoded. Default is
text/plain.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u PUT-file <br>
File containing data to PUT. Remember to also set -T.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v verbosity <br>
Set verbosity level - 4 and above prints information on
headers, 3 and above prints response codes (404, 200, etc.),
2 and above prints warnings and info.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Display version number and
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w Print out results in HTML
tables. Default table is two columns wide, with a white
background.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x &lt;table&gt;-attributes <br>
String to use as attributes for &lt;table&gt;. Attributes
are inserted &lt;table here &gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X proxy[:port] <br>
Use a proxy server for the requests.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-y &lt;tr&gt;-attributes <br>
String to use as attributes for &lt;tr&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z &lt;td&gt;-attributes <br>
String to use as attributes for &lt;td&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Z ciphersuite <br>
Specify SSL/TLS cipher suite (See openssl ciphers)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT <br>
The following list describes the values returned by ab:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Server Software <br>
The value, if any, returned in the server HTTP header of the
first successful response. This includes all characters in
the header from beginning to the point a character <br>
with decimal value of 32 (most notably: a space or CR/LF) is
detected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Server Hostname <br>
The DNS or IP address given on the command line</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Server Port <br>
The port to which ab is connecting. If no port is given on
the command line, this will default to 80 for http and 443
for https.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SSL/TLS Protocol <br>
The protocol parameters negotiated between the client and
server. This will only be printed if SSL is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Document Path <br>
The request URI parsed from the command line string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Document Length <br>
This is the size in bytes of the first successfully returned
document. If the document length changes during testing, the
response is considered an error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Concurrency Level <br>
The number of concurrent clients used during the test</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Time taken for tests <br>
This is the time taken from the moment the first socket
connection is created to the moment the last response is
received</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Complete requests <br>
The number of successful responses received</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Failed requests <br>
The number of requests that were considered a failure. If
the number is greater than zero, another line will be
printed showing the number of requests that failed due to
<br>
connecting, reading, incorrect content length, or
exceptions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Write errors <br>
The number of errors that failed during write (broken
pipe).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Non-2xx responses <br>
The number of responses that were not in the 200 series of
response codes. If all responses were 200, this field is not
printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Keep-Alive requests <br>
The number of connections that resulted in Keep-Alive
requests</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Total body sent <br>
If configured to send data as part of the test, this is the
total number of bytes sent during the tests. This field is
omitted if the test did not include a body to send.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Total transferred <br>
The total number of bytes received from the server. This
number is essentially the number of bytes sent over the
wire.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HTML transferred <br>
The total number of document bytes received from the server.
This number excludes bytes received in HTTP headers</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Requests per second <br>
This is the number of requests per second. This value is the
result of dividing the number of requests by the total time
taken</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Time per request <br>
The average time spent per request. The first value is
calculated with the formula concurrency * timetaken * 1000 /
done while the second value is calculated with the
for&acirc; <br>
mula timetaken * 1000 / done</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Transfer rate <br>
The rate of transfer as calculated by the formula totalread
/ 1024 / timetaken</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
There are various statically declared buffers of fixed
length. Combined with the lazy parsing of the command line
arguments, the response headers from the server and other
exter&acirc; <br>
nal inputs, this might bite you.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It does not implement HTTP/1.x
fully; only accepts some &rsquo;expected&rsquo; forms of
responses. The rather heavy use of strstr(3) shows up top in
profile, which might indicate a perfor&acirc; <br>
mance problem; i.e., you would measure the ab performance
rather than the server&rsquo;s.</p>
