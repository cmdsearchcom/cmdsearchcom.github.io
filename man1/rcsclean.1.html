<p>RCSCLEAN(1) General Commands Manual RCSCLEAN(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
rcsclean - clean up working files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
rcsclean [options] [ file ... ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
rcsclean removes files that are not being worked on.
rcsclean -u also unlocks and removes files that are being
worked on but have not changed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For each file given, rcsclean
compares the working file and a revision in the
corresponding RCS file. If it finds a difference, it does
nothing. Otherwise, it first unlocks the <br>
revision if the -u option is given, and then removes the
working file unless the working file is writable and the
revision is locked. It logs its actions by outputting the
cor&acirc; <br>
responding rcs -u and rm -f commands on the standard
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Files are paired as explained in
ci(1). If no file is given, all working files in the current
directory are cleaned. Filenames matching an RCS suffix
denote RCS files; all oth&acirc; <br>
ers denote working files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The number of the revision to
which the working file is compared may be attached to any of
the options -n, -q, -r, or -u. If no revision number is
specified, then if the -u <br>
option is given and the caller has one revision locked,
rcsclean uses that revision; otherwise rcsclean uses the
latest revision on the default branch, normally the
root.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rcsclean is useful for clean
targets in makefiles. See also rcsdiff(1), which prints out
the differences, and ci(1), which normally reverts to the
previous revision if a file <br>
was not changed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-ksubst <br>
Use subst style keyword substitution when retrieving the
revision for comparison. See co(1) for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n[rev] <br>
Do not actually remove any files or unlock any revisions.
Using this option will tell you what rcsclean would do
without actually doing it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q[rev] <br>
Do not log the actions taken on standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r[rev] <br>
This option has no effect other than specifying the revision
for comparison.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T Preserve the modification
time on the RCS file even if the RCS file changes because a
lock is removed. This option can suppress extensive
recompilation caused by a <br>
make(1) dependency of some other copy of the working file on
the RCS file. Use this option with care; it can suppress
recompilation even when it is needed, i.e. when the <br>
lock removal would mean a change to keyword strings in the
other working file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u[rev] <br>
Unlock the revision if it is locked and no difference is
found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Print RCS&rsquo;s version
number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Vn Emulate RCS version n. See
co(1) for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-xsuffixes <br>
Use suffixes to characterize RCS files. See ci(1) for
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-zzone Use zone as the time zone
for keyword substitution; see co(1) for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
rcsclean *.c *.h</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">removes all working files ending
in .c or .h that were not changed since their checkout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rcsclean</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">removes all working files in the
current directory that were not changed since their
checkout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
rcsclean accesses files much as ci(1) does.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
RCSINIT <br>
Options prepended to the argument list, separated by spaces.
A backslash escapes spaces within an option. The RCSINIT
options are prepended to the argument lists of most <br>
RCS commands. Useful RCSINIT options include -q, -V, -x, and
-z.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RCS_MEM_LIMIT <br>
An integer lim, measured in kilobytes, specifying the
threshold under which commands will try to use memory-based
operations for processing the RCS file. (For RCS files <br>
of size lim kilobytes or greater, RCS will use the slower
standard input/output routines.) Default value is 256.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TMPDIR Name of the temporary
directory. If not set, the environment variables TMP and
TEMP are inspected instead and the first value found is
taken; if none of them are set, a <br>
host-dependent default is used, typically /tmp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
The exit status is zero if and only if all operations were
successful. Missing working files and RCS files are silently
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The full documentation for RCS
is maintained as a Texinfo manual. If the info(1) and RCS
programs are properly installed at your site, the
command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">info rcs</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">should give you access to the
complete manual. Additionally, the RCS homepage:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">http://www.gnu.org/software/rcs/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">has news and links to the latest
release, development site, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
At least one file must be given in older Unix versions that
do not provide the needed directory scanning operations.</p>
