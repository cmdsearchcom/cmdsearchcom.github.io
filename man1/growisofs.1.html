<p>GROWISOFS(1m) GROWISOFS(1m)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
growisofs - combined mkisofs frontend/DVD recording
program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
growisofs [-dry-run] [-dvd-compat] [-overburn] [-speed=1]
-[Z|M] /dev/dvd &lt;mkisofs-options&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
growisofs was originally designed as a frontend to mkisofs
to facilitate appending of data to ISO9660 volumes residing
on random-access media such as DVD+RW, DVD-RAM, plain <br>
files, hard disk partitions. In the course of development
general purpose DVD recording support was implemented, and
as of now growisofs supports not only random-access media,
<br>
but even mastering of multisession DVD media such as DVD+R
and DVD-R/-RW, as well as Blu-ray Disc. In addition
growisofs supports first-/single-session recording of
arbitrary <br>
pre-mastered image (formatted as UDF, ISO9660 or any other
file system, if formatted at all) to all supported DVD media
types.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-Z /dev/dvd <br>
Burn an initial session to the selected device. A special
form of this option is recognized to support burning of
pre-mastered images. See EXAMPLES section for further <br>
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M /dev/dvd <br>
Merge a new session to an existing one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-version <br>
Print version information and invoke mkisofs, also with
-version option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dvd-compat <br>
Provide maximum media compatibility with DVD-ROM/-Video. In
write-once DVD+R or DVD-R context this results in
unappendable recording (closed disk). In DVD+RW context it
<br>
instructs the logical unit to explicitly burn [otherwise
optional] lead-out.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dry-run <br>
At dry-run growisofs performs all the steps till, but not
including the first write operation. Most notably check for
&quot;overburn&quot; condition is performed, which implies
that <br>
mkisofs is invoked and terminated prematurely.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-overburn <br>
Normally single layer DVD media can accommodate up to
approximately 4.700.000.000 bytes (in marketing speech
4.7GB). In other words a DVD can contain about 4.377 GiB or
<br>
4482 MiB. Same kind of arithmetics applies to Blu-ray Disc
capacity of 25.000.000.000 bytes. Anyway, growisofs
won&rsquo;t start without this option, if
&quot;overburn&quot; condition <br>
appears to be unavoidable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-speed=N <br>
An option to control recording velocity. Most commonly
you&rsquo;ll use -speed=1 with &quot;no-name&quot; media, if
default speed setting messes up the media. Keep in mind that
N essen&acirc; <br>
tially denotes speed closest to N*1385KBps in DVD or
N*4496KBps in Blu-ray Disc case among those offered by unit
for currently mounted media. The list can be found in <br>
dvd+rw-mediainfo output. Note that Blu-ray Disc recordings
are commonly performed at ~1/2 of advertised speed, because
of defect management being in effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;mkisofs-options&gt; <br>
More options can be found in the manpage for mkisofs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are several undocumented
options commonly denoted with -use-the-force-luke prefix.
Some of them serve debugging purposes. Some require certain
knowledge about recording <br>
process or even OS kernel internals and as being such can
induce confusing behaviour. Some are to be used in very
specific situations better recognized by front-ends or
automated <br>
scripts. Rationale behind leaving these options undocumented
is that those few users who would actually need to use them
directly can as well consult the source code or obtain <br>
specific instructions elsewhere.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIFFERENCES WITH RUNNING MKISOFS
DIRECTLY <br>
When using growisofs you may not use the -o option for an
output file. growisofs dumps the image directly to the
media;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You don&rsquo;t have to specify
the -C option to create a higher level session on a
multisession disk, growisofs will construct one for you;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Otherwise everything that
applies to [multisession] mastering with mkisofs applies to
growisofs as well. growisofs needs at least mkisofs version
1.14, version 2.0 is required <br>
for multisession write-once recordings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Actual device names vary from one operating system to
another. We use /dev/dvd as a collective name or as symbolic
link to the actual device if you wish. Under Linux it will
most <br>
likely be an ide-scsi device such as &quot;/dev/sr0.&quot;
Under NetBSD/OpenBSD it has to be a character SCSI CD-ROM
device such as &quot;/dev/rcd0c.&quot; Under Solaris it also
has to be a charac&acirc; <br>
ter SCSI/ATAPI CD-ROM device, e.g.
&quot;/dev/rdsk/c0t1d0s2&quot; or
&quot;/vol/dev/aliases/cdrom0.&quot; And likewise in HP-UX,
IRIX and Mac OS X...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To master and burn an ISO9660
volume with Joliet and Rock-Ridge extensions on a DVD or
Blu-ray Disc:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">growisofs -Z /dev/dvd -R -J
/some/files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To append more data to same
media:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">growisofs -M /dev/dvd -R -J
/more/files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Make sure to use the same
options for both initial burning and when appending
data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To finalize the multisession DVD
maintaining maximum compatibility:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">growisofs -M
/dev/dvd=/dev/zero</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To use growisofs to write a
pre-mastered ISO-image to a DVD:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">growisofs -dvd-compat -Z
/dev/dvd=image.iso</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where image.iso represents an
arbitrary object in the filesystem, such as file, named pipe
or device entry. Nothing is growing here and command name is
not intuitive in this con&acirc; <br>
text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
If executed under sudo(8) growisofs refuses to start. This
is done for the following reason. Naturally growisofs has to
access the data set to be recorded to optical media, <br>
either indirectly by letting mkisofs generate ISO9660 layout
on-the-fly or directly if a pre-mastered image is to be
recorded. Being executed under sudo(8), growisofs
effectively <br>
grants sudoers read access to any file in the file system.
The situation is intensified by the fact that growisofs
parses MKISOFS environment variable in order to determine
<br>
alternative path to mkisofs executable image. This means
that being executed under sudo(8), growisofs effectively
grants sudoers right to execute program of their choice with
<br>
elevated privileges. If you for any reason still find the
above acceptable and are willing to take the consequences,
then consider running following wrapper script under sudo(8)
<br>
in place for real growisofs binary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#!/bin/ksh <br>
unset SUDO_COMMAND <br>
export MKISOFS=/path/to/trusted/mkisofs <br>
exec growisofs &quot;$@&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">But note that the recommended
alternative to the above &quot;workaround&quot; is actually
to install growisofs set-root-uid, in which case it will
drop privileges prior accessing data or <br>
executing mkisofs in order to preclude unauthorized access
to the data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the media already carries
isofs and growisofs is invoked with -Z option
non-interactively, e.g. through cron, it shall fail with
&quot;FATAL: /dev/dvd already carries isofs!&quot; Note <br>
that only ISO9660 is recognized, you can perfectly zap e.g.
an UDF filesystem non-interactively. Recommendation is to
prepare media for unattended usage by re-formatting or
nul&acirc; <br>
lifying first 64KB in advance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;Overburn&quot; protection
in pre-mastered image context works only with plain files
and ISO9660 formatted volumes. E.g. [given that /dev/root is
an ext2 formatted file system larger <br>
than 4.7GB] /dev/dvd=/dev/root is bound to produce corrupted
recording.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that DVD+RW re-formatting
procedure does not substitute for blanking. If you want to
nullify the media, e.g. for privacy reasons, do it
explicitly with &rsquo;growisofs -Z <br>
/dev/dvd=/dev/zero&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Playback of re-writable DVD
media, both DVD+RW and DVD-RW, might be limited in legacy
DVD-ROM/-Video units. In most cases this is due to lower
reflectivity of such media.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Even though growisofs supports
it, playback of multisession write-once DVD might be limited
to the first session for two reasons:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; not all DVD-ROM
players are capable of multi-border DVD-R playback, even
less are aware of DVD+R multisessioning, burner unit
therefore might be the only one in your <br>
vicinity capable of accessing files written at different
occasions;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; OS might fail to
mount multisession DVD for various reasons;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The above is not applicable to
DVD+RW, DVD-RW Restricted Overwrite, DVD-RAM or Blu-ray
Disc, as volumes are grown within a single session.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When growisofs &quot;runs
into&quot; blank Blu-ray Disc media, BD-RE or BD-R, it gets
pre-formatted with minimal spare area size of 256MB.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A DVD-RW accepts two disc modes:
the Sequential Recording and the Restricted Overwrite. If a
DVD-RW medium is in the later one, it will behave much like
DVD+RW. By default <br>
DVD-RW discs are in Sequential Recording mode, but can be
put into Restricted Overwrite mode using dvd+rw-format. See
dvd+rw-format (1) for more info.</p>
