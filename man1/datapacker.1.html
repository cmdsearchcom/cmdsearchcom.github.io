<p>DATAPACKER(1) datapacker Manual DATAPACKER(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
datapacker - Tool to pack files into the minimum number of
bins</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
datapacker [ -0 ] [ -a ACTION ] [ -b FORMAT ] [ -d ] [ -p ]
[ -S SIZE ] -s SIZE FILE ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">datapacker -h | --help</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
datapacker is a tool to group files by size. It is designed
to group files such that they fill fixed-size containers
(called &quot;bins&quot;) using the minimum number of
containers. <br>
This is useful, for instance, if you want to archive a
number of files to CD or DVD, and want to organize them such
that you use the minimum possible number of CDs or DVDs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In many cases, datapacker
executes almost instantaneously. Of particular note, the
hardlink action (see OPTIONS below) can be used to
effectively copy data into bins without <br>
having to actually copy the data at all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">datapacker is a tool in the
traditional Unix style; it can be used in pipes and call
other tools.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Here are the command-line options you may set for
datapacker. Please note that -s and at least one file (see
FILE SPECIFICATION below) is mandatory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--null When reading a list of
files from standard input (see FILE SPECIFICATION below),
expect the input to be separated by NULL (ASCII 0)
characters instead of one per line. <br>
Especially useful with find -print0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a ACTION</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--action=ACTION <br>
Defines what action to take with the matches. Please note
that, with any action, the output will be sorted by bin,
with bin 1 first. Possible actions include:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print Print one human-readable
line per file. Each line contains the bin number (in the
format given by -b), an ASCII tab character, then the
filename.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">printfull <br>
Print one semi-human-readable line per bin. Each line
contains the bin number, then a list of filenames to place
in that bin, with an ASCII tab character after the <br>
bin number and between each filename.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print0 For each file, output the
bin number (according to the format given by -b), an ASCII
NULL character, the filename, and another ASCII NULL
character. Ideal for use <br>
with xargs -0 -L 2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">exec:COMMAND <br>
For each file, execute the specified COMMAND via the shell.
The program COMMAND will be passed information on its
command line as indicated below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is an error if the generated
command line for a given bin is too large for the
system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A nonzero exit code from any
COMMAND will cause datapacker to terminate. If COMMAND
contains quotes, don&rsquo;t forget to quote the entire
command, as in:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">datapacker
&rsquo;--action=exec:echo &quot;Bin: $1&quot;; shift; ls
&quot;$@&quot;&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The arguments to the given
command will be:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; argv[0] ($0 in
shell) will be the name of the shell used to invoke the
command -- $SHELL or /bin/sh.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; argv[1] ($1 in
shell) will be the bin number, formatted according to
-b.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; argv[2] and on
($2 and on in shell) will be the files to place in that
bin</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hardlink <br>
For each file, create a hardlink at bin/filename pointing to
the original input filename. Creates the directory bin as
necessary. Alternative locations and for&acirc; <br>
mats for bin can be specified with -b. All bin directories
and all input must reside on the same filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After you are done processing
the results of the bin, you may safely delete the bins
without deleting original data. Alternatively, you could
leave the bins and <br>
delete the original data. Either approach will be
workable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is an error to attempt to
make a hard link across filesystems, or to have two input
files with the same filename in different paths. datapacker
will exit on <br>
either of these situations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See also --deep-links.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">symlink <br>
Like hardlink, but create symlinks instead. Symlinks can
span filesystems, but you will lose information if you
remove the original (pre-bin) data. Like hardlink, <br>
it is an error to have a single filename occur in multiple
input directories with this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See also --deep-links.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b FORMAT</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--binfmt=FORMAT <br>
Defines the output format for the bin name. This format is
given as a %d input to a function that interprets it as
printf(3) would. This can be useful both to define the <br>
name and the location of your bins. When running datapacker
with certain arguments, the bin format can be taken to be a
directory in which files in that bin are linked. <br>
The default is %03d, which outputs integers with leading
zeros to make all bin names at least three characters
wide.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other useful variants could
include destdir/%d to put the string &quot;destdir/&quot; in
front of the bin number, which is rendered without leading
zeros.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--debug <br>
Enable debug mode. This is here for future expansion and
does not currently have any effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--deep-links <br>
When used with the symlink or hardlink action, instead of
making all links in a single flat directory under the bin,
mimic the source directory structure under the bin. <br>
Makes most sense when used with -p, but could also be useful
without it if there are files with the same name in
different source directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help Display brief usage
information and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--preserve-order <br>
Normally, datapacker uses an efficient algorithm that tries
to rearrange files such that the number of bins required is
minimized. Sometimes you may instead wish to pre&acirc; <br>
serve the ordering of files at the expense of potentially
using more bins. In these cases, you would want to use this
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As an example of such a
situation: perhaps you have taken one photo a day for
several years. You would like to archive these photos to CD,
but you want them to be stored <br>
in chronological order. You have named the files such that
the names indicate order, so you can pass the file list to
datapacker using -p to preserve the ordering in your <br>
bins. Thus, bin 1 will contain the oldest files, bin 2 the
second-oldest, and so on. If -p wasn&rsquo;t used, you might
use fewer CDs, but the photos would be spread out <br>
across all CDs without preserving your chronological
order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s SIZE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--size=SIZE <br>
Gives the size of each bin in bytes. Suffixes such as
&quot;k&quot;, &quot;m&quot;, &quot;g&quot;, etc. may be
used to indicate kilobytes, megabytes, gigabytes, and so
forth. Numbers such as 1.5g are <br>
valid, and if needed, will be rounded to the nearest
possible integer value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The size of the first bin may be
overridden with -S.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here are the sizes of some
commonly-used bins. For each item, I have provided you with
both the underlying recording capacity of the disc and a
suggested value for -s. <br>
The suggested value for -s is lower than the underlying
capacity because there is overhead imposed by the filesystem
stored on the disc. You will perhaps find that the <br>
suggested value for -s is lower than optimal for discs that
contain few large files, and higher than desired for discs
that contain vast amounts of small files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; CD-ROM,
74-minute (standard): 650m / 600m</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; CD-ROM,
80-minute: 703m / 650m</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; CD-ROM,
90-minute: 790m / 740m</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; CD-ROM,
99-minute: 870m / 820m</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; DVD+-R: 4.377g /
4g</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; DVD+R, dual
layer: 8.5g / 8g</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--size-first <br>
The size of the first bin. If not given, defaults to the
value given with -s. This may be useful if you will be using
a mechanism outside datapacker to add additional <br>
information to the first bin: perhaps an index of which bin
has which file, the information necessary to make a CD
bootable, etc. You may use the same suffixes as with -s <br>
with this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--sort Sorts the list of files
to process before acting upon them. When combined with -p,
causes the output to be sorted. This option has no effect
save increasing CPU usage <br>
when not combined with -p.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILE SPECIFICATION <br>
After the options, you must supply one or more files to
consider for packing into bins. Alternatively, instead of
listing files on the command line, you may list a single
hyphen <br>
(-), which tells datapacker to read the list of files from
standard input (stdin).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">datapacker never recurses into
subdirectories. If you want a recursive search -- finding
all files in a given directory and all its subdirectories --
see the second example in <br>
the EXAMPLES section below. datapacker is designed to
integrate with find(1) in this situation to let you take
advantage of find&rsquo;s built-in powerful recursion and
filtering fea&acirc; <br>
tures.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When reading files from standard
input, it is assumed that the list contains one distinct
filename per line. Seasoned POSIX veterans will recognize
the inherent limitations in <br>
this format. For that reason, when given -0 in conjunction
with the single file -, datapacker will instead expect, on
standard input, a list of files, each one terminated by an
<br>
ASCII NULL character. Such a list can be easily generated
with find(1) using its -print0 option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
&Acirc;&middot; Put all JPEG images in ~/Pictures into bins
(using hardlinks) under the pre-existing directory ~/bins,
no more than 600MB per bin:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">datapacker -b ~/bins/%03d -s
600m -a hardlink ~/Pictures/*.jpg</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Put all files in
~/Pictures or any subdirectory thereof into 600MB bins under
~/bins, using hardlinking. This is a simple example to
follow if you simply want a recursive <br>
search of all files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">find ~/Pictures -type f -print0
| datapacker -0 -b ~/bins/%03d -s 600m -a hardlink -</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Find all JPEG
images in ~/Pictures or any subdirectory thereof, put them
into bins (using hardlinks) under the pre-existing directory
~/bins, no more than 600MB per bin:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">find ~/Pictures -name
&quot;*.jpg&quot; -print0 | datapacker -0 -b ~/bins/%03d -s
600m -a hardlink -</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Find all JPEG
images as above, put them in 4GB bins, but instead of
putting them anywhere, calculate the size of each bin and
display it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">find ~/Pictures -name
&quot;*.jpg&quot; -print0 | datapacker -0 -b ~/bins/%03d -s
4g &rsquo;--action=exec:echo -n &quot;$1: &quot;; shift; du
-ch &quot;$@&quot; | grep total&rsquo; -</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This will display output like
so:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/home/jgoerzen/bins/001: 4.0G
total <br>
/home/jgoerzen/bins/002: 4.0G total <br>
/home/jgoerzen/bins/003: 4.0G total <br>
/home/jgoerzen/bins/004: 992M total</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: the grep pattern in this
example is simple, but will cause unexpected results if any
matching file contains the word &quot;total&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Find all JPEG
images as above, and generate 600MB ISO images of them in
~/bins. This will generate the ISO images directly without
ever hardlinking files into ~/bins.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">find ~/Pictures -name
&quot;*.jpg&quot; -print0 | datapacker -0 -b ~/bins/%03d.iso
-s 4g &rsquo;--action=exec:BIN=&quot;$1&quot;; shift;
mkisofs -r -J -o &quot;$BIN&quot; &quot;$@&quot;&rsquo;
-</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You could, if you so desired,
pipe this result directly into a DVD-burning application.
Or, you could use growisofs to burn a DVD+R in a single
step.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ERRORS <br>
It is an error if any specified file exceeds the value given
with -s or -S.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is also an error if any
specified files disappear while datapacker is running.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Reports of bugs should be reported online at the datapacker
homepage. Debian users are encouraged to instead use the
Debian bug-tracking system.</p>
