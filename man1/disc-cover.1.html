<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Disc-Cover creates front and back covers for audio CDs. The
CD has to be present in the CD-ROM drive, or alternatively a
valid CDDB file can be used. Disc-Cover searches the <br>
CDDB database for an entry corresponding to the CD&rsquo;s
CDDB ID. It starts by looking for a local CDDB entry in
~/.cddb (or another directory pointed to by your cddb
installation). <br>
If no local CDDB entry matches the CD, disc-cover continues
to search the online CDDB databases or CDINDEX databases as
configured in the AudioCD library. It then formats the <br>
entry to produce a Latex, Dvi, Postscript or PDF file, which
contains the front and back covers on a single page. Other
formats supported include a simple text output, a CDDB <br>
compatible format, HTML and an output format that can be
used with cdlabelgen
(http://www.red-bean.com/~bwf/software/cdlabelgen/), another
cover builder.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">QUICKSTART <br>
The easiest way of using Disc-Cover is to put an audio cd in
your cdrom drive and then run disc-cover without options.
Disc-Cover will tell you what it does and if it is able to
<br>
create a set of covers it tells you the name of the file it
creates. Normally this is a PostScript file that is ready
for printing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LAYOUT <br>
The front cover shows artist, album title and when available
extended disc info. Optionally a picture can be added to the
front cover. The back cover holds the title and artist <br>
in the same fashion. In addition to those, the back cover
lists the individual tracks, preceded by a track number and
followed by their running time. The total running time of
<br>
the CD is given at the bottom of the back cover. The sides
of the back cover contain the artist and CD title. Another
flap hangs on the side of the right of the back cover. When
<br>
using fully transparent jewel cases this flap is visible
from the front. By default it holds the user&rsquo;s full
name. Colour is also supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FEATURES <br>
- Uses Latex to produce high quality output. <br>
- Outputs in Latex, Dvi, Postscript, Pdf, Cddb entry, HTML,
Text and a format to use with cdlabelgen. <br>
- Supports caching of cddb entries in a directory that can
be shared with other cddb-aware programs. <br>
- Connects with a cddb or cdindex server to get the disc
title, artist and list of track titles and extended
information where available. <br>
- Optionally put a picture on the front cover, supports
almost any image format. <br>
- Optionally let Disc-Cover search on allmusic.com for a
small version of the corresponding front cover of the cd,
which it will put on your front cover. <br>
- Assign different colours to different items such as artist
name and track numbers. <br>
- Supports double albums (two cds in one jewel case). <br>
- Creates covers for jewel cases and various slim cases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-2, -second filename <br>
When using this option disc-cover goes into double album
mode, meaning it will print the front cover using the first
cddb entry, either reading the cd in the drive or by <br>
using a file as described in &quot;-f, -file filename&quot;
option. Then it prints the back cover with two halves, the
upper half consists the title/artist and then the tracks of
the <br>
first cd, the lower half contains the tracks of the second
cd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a, -additional text <br>
Add text to the bottom of the front cover. Default is to put
extended disc information here. You can use this to cancel
the extended disc information by doing &rsquo;-a &quot;
&quot;&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-allmusic <br>
Search on wwww.allmusic.com for the front cover of the
album. This picture will be put on the front cover, just
like with -p and -pic. These last options override this
flag. <br>
This way you can enable -allmusic by default in the config
file and override it whenever you need to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b, -flaptext text <br>
Add text to the additional flap at the side of the back
cover. This flap is visible when used with a fully
transparent jewel case. These are becoming more common
everyday. By <br>
default text from the password entry is used. We take the
string from the comments field up until the first comma.
Most times this should be the user&rsquo;s full name. Cancel
this <br>
text by using the configuration file or with &rsquo;-b
&quot; &quot;&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, -casetype
(jewel|slim|x-slim|tevion-slim|letter-slim) <br>
These options correspond with files in one of the
@config_template_dirs which are templates that describe case
types. You can also copy one of these files to your current
<br>
directory, change it and let disc-cover use your own
template. The cases described next are delivered together
with Disc-Cover. Setting this to slim will have Disc-Cover
<br>
output covers in a format suitable for slim cases. These are
thinner cases often used for single cds or EPs. Use x-slim
if you want the side and flap exchanged. Even more <br>
slim are the cases provided by Tevion (use: tevion-slim).
For people using letter format that have trouble with not
getting the whole case fitted on paper, please use letter-
<br>
slim.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C, -Configuration filename <br>
Output configuration to a file. The current flags and
options set in existing configuration files or given on the
commandline are used to set the values. To see the current
<br>
settings do ;disc-cover -C -&rsquo;. For example, you can
change the default output format to pdf as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">disc-cover -t pdf -C
~/.disc-coverrc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D, -Device device <br>
Specify the CD-ROM device. Default is to use /dev/cdrom</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e, -extended <br>
This flag enables extended track information, when
available. This extended information will be added below the
track names. It is mostly used in compilation cds for artist
<br>
information. Sometimes this extended track information has
been used for lyrics, needles to say this will not fit at
the back of one cd cover and hence to prevent the <br>
destruction of the layout only the first line will be used.
That is why this is an option instead of default
behaviour.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, -file filename <br>
Use filename as input instead of searching the local and
online CDDB database. File should be a valid CDDB entry.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g, -genre <br>
Include the genre of the disc as the last line of the bottom
text on the front cover. The line looks like this:
&quot;genre: genre&quot;. Default is off, as often the wrong
genre is <br>
used or even just misc or data has been chosen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, -help <br>
Print help message and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H, -Help <br>
Show the manual page using pod2text, this should be
installed and working (you can check this by typing
&rsquo;pod2text /path/to/disc-cover&rsquo;)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, -new <br>
Creates a new cddb entry. This works with any format, but
should be used in conjunction with &rsquo;-t cddb&rsquo; to
create a template for you to fill in. See the
&quot;FREQUENTLY ASKED <br>
QUESTIONS&quot; to create covers for your custom cds or for
cds that are not in the CDDB database yet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o, -output filename <br>
The -o switch allows to specify the name of the output file.
By default the filename will be Artist_Title.xxx, where xxx
is txt, tex, dvi, ps, pdf or html, depending on the <br>
file format. See -t option for supported file formats. Using
&quot;-o -&quot; will send the output to standard
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p filename <br>
Includes the picture filename on the front cover in a framed
box right aligned with the artist name. The format of the
picture has to be known to the program convert that <br>
comes with ImageMagick. Also the graphicx package for LaTeX
has to be available. The picture is scaled to 200x200 and
converted into Adobe Encapsulated PostScript Interchange
<br>
format. Remember that output in tex, dvi, txt, html and
labelgen are completely useless with pictures. In case of
output in pdf the picture is transformed into Encapsulated
<br>
Portable Document Format (EPDF).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pic filename <br>
Include a graphics file on the front cover without
converting it. This only works when the format of the file
is the same as the output format. In case of PostScript (PS)
<br>
output you can use Encapsulated PostScript (EPS,EPSI) files.
In case of Portable Document Format (PDF) you can use
Encapsulated Portable Document Format (EPDF). Note that <br>
this is essentially the same option as in &quot;-p
filename&quot; but no scaling or converting is performed.
More responsibility goes to the user this way.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R, -Remove <br>
By default disc-cover deletes all temporary files it creates
before it exits. This behaviour can be overwritten by
specifying the this option. For debugging purposes only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S, -Server <br>
Create a default configuration for the selection of CDDB
server. This configuration is used by other CDDB aware
programs too, so be careful. Note that Disc-Cover will not
<br>
overwrite the configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t, -type
txt|tex|dvi|ps|pdf|cddb|lbl|html <br>
The -t switch allows to specify the output format. By
default disc-cover will create a Postscript file. Other
formats supported include ASCII text (txt), LaTeX (tex), DVI
<br>
(dvi), PDF (pdf), cddb database format (cddb), a cdlabelgen
compatible format (lbl) and in Hypertext Markup Language
(html).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u, -uppercase <br>
Fixes those annoying entries that are written without
capitals. It capitalises every single word in titles and
artists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, -version <br>
Print version and program information and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, -Verbose <br>
Enable verbose output of Disc-Cover, the libaudiocd library
and all third party software, such as LaTeX, dvips and
convert. For debugging purposes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-va, -variousartists <br>
Some CDDB entries code every track in the &rsquo;artist /
title&rsquo; format. Mostly, this is used for artists that
contain various artists. By enabling this option Disc-Cover
will <br>
decode and use that information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-template_list <br>
Prints a list of output template types and their
descriptions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION <br>
Disc-cover first checks the file /etc/disc-cover.conf for
system wide parameters and then looks at ~/.disc-coverrc.
Following are all the different variables that can be set.
The <br>
file ~/.cdserverrc is used indirectly through the AudioCD
library. This file contains the CDDB and CDINDEX servers.
Furthermore it can be used to control certain other options
of <br>
this library. See the appropriate documentation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can generate a configuration
file with the &quot;-C, -Configuration filename&quot;
option. Keep in mind that the values in this file will be
set by looking at the current settings. <br>
That is, any existing configuration files or options on the
commandline will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To make a clean configuration
file, first remove the ~/.disc-coverrc file and then run
Disc-Cover without any option but &rsquo;-C&rsquo;:
disc-cover -C ~/.disc-coverrc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$config_version_config <br>
This will be used in the future by new versions of
Disc-Cover to check for inconsistencies in changed, removed
or added configuration options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default:
&rsquo;1.4.0&rsquo;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$config_tmp_dir <br>
This sets the directory that is used for temporary
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default: &rsquo;/tmp&rsquo;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$config_output_format <br>
This is the default output format. Although you can choose
any of the types listed in &rsquo;disc-cover -h&rsquo;
option the most common would be &rsquo;ps&rsquo; or
&rsquo;pdf&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default: &rsquo;ps&rsquo;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$config_device <br>
The default cdrom drive that is used to scan a cd. See
&quot;-D, -Device device&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default:
&rsquo;/dev/cdrom&rsquo;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$config_cddb_cache_directory
<br>
The path where cddb entries are stored in and retrieved
from. This can be shared with other programs that also use
cddb.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default:
&quot;$ENV{HOME}/.cddb&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$flag_with_extended_track_info
<br>
Setting this to one will force disc-cover to include
extended track information. See &quot;-e, -extended&quot;
option. It is advised to keep this 0 as there are lots of
entries that <br>
contain ugly and meaningless extended information. Most of
the time it is only useful in case of various artists
cds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default: 0;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$flag_various_artist_cd <br>
Setting this to one will force disc-cover to parse every
track the same way it parses the &rsquo;artist /
title&rsquo; label. This might be useful for various artist
cds where every <br>
track is formatted in the same way. It is adviced to leave
this option 0, as disc-cover will issue a warning whenever
it encounters such a disc. You can easily turn it on <br>
with &quot;-va, -variousartists&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default: 0;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$flag_double_disc_cdtitle <br>
Setting this flag during the processing of a double cd
(using the &quot;-2, -second&quot; option) enables a
&rsquo;smart&rsquo; algorithm that attempts to find a nice
title for the cd, using the <br>
titles of both cddb entries. It will remove all characters
unequal in both strings, and gets rid of any characters
surrounding uncommon parts. Last, it removes the words <br>
&rsquo;disc&rsquo; and &rsquo;disk&rsquo;, plus any
whitespace at the beginning or end., -second&gt;&gt; option)

uncommon parts. Last, it removes the words
&rsquo;disc&rsquo; and <br>
&rsquo;disk&rsquo;, plus any whitespace at the beginning or
end.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default: 1;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$flag_genre <br>
By setting this an additional line will be added to the
bottom of the bottom text on the front cover with the genre
(taken from the database) of the disc. See -g, -genre <br>
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default: 0;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$flag_picture_use_allmusic <br>
Setting this flag does the same as the -allmusic option.
That is, Disc-Cover will search for a cover picture on
allmusic to be put on the front cover.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default: 0;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$flag_uppercase_fix <br>
Setting this flag does the same as the -u,-uppercase option.
That is, Disc-Cover will capitalise every single word in
titles and artists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default: 0;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%config_latex_colors <br>
This is a list of colours that can be set to alter most of
the different items that appear on the covers. You can
change the colour of the title, artist, discinfo, track <br>
strings, track numbers and track times independently. Use
colours from the color.sty Latex file: black, white, red,
green, blue, cyan, magenta and yellow.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default: ( title =&gt;
&rsquo;black&rsquo;, <br>
artist =&gt; &rsquo;black&rsquo;, <br>
discinfo =&gt; &rsquo;black&rsquo;, <br>
track_number =&gt; &rsquo;black&rsquo;, <br>
track_string =&gt; &rsquo;black&rsquo;, <br>
track_time =&gt; &rsquo;black&rsquo;, <br>
track_extended =&gt; &rsquo;black&rsquo; <br>
track_artist =&gt; &rsquo;black&rsquo; <br>
flaptext =&gt; &rsquo;black&rsquo;, <br>
);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$config_flaptext <br>
This takes the string from the comments field of the
user&rsquo;s password entry. We use only the text up until
the first comma, which normally is set to the user&rsquo;s
full name. You <br>
can also put a simple string here or an empty one to cancel
the output. See also &quot;-b, -flaptext text&quot;
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default: split &rsquo;,&rsquo;,
(getpwuid($&lt;)))[6];</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$config_casetype <br>
This determines for which type of case output is generated.
It searches for a template file in all the
@config_template_dirs with the same name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default: &quot;jewel&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$latex_user_packages <br>
If you create a template that requires special LaTeX
packages, they can be added here. Generally not advised if
you want to share your templates with others as they need to
<br>
own those LaTeX packages, and add them to Disc-Cover&rsquo;s
configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default: &quot;&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$latex_language_encoding <br>
Whenever you create cds with languages not normally
supported by LaTeX you should add or change this. It calls
sepackage[$latex_language_encoding]{inputenc}. Main
encodings <br>
are, latin1 for ISO Latin-1, ascii for pure ASCII, ansinew
and cp1252 (they are synonyms) for Windows 3.1 ANSI (an MS
extension of ISO Latin-1) and applemac for Apple <br>
MacIntosh.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default: &quot;latin1&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A: You have no CDDB servers
configured. Either use the wonderful program cdcd to create
such a configuration or run disc-cover with the options
-S.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Q: How do I make a cover for
homemade cds? <br>
A: Follow these steps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. Insert the homemade cd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Run disc-cover like this:
<br>
disc-cover -n -t cddb -o myfile.cddb</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. Edit the myfile.cddb with
some text editor, the tracks will all be named <br>
&quot;Untitled&quot;. This should be very easy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. For printable output run
disc-cover again: <br>
disc-cover -f myfile.cddb</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Q: I have been using 1.0.1.
under SuSE 7.3 for a while an want to upgrade to 1.3.X or
higher However, Audio-CD does not compile. <br>
A: You have to install lbcdaudio first. Your distribution
does not contain it, or it does not install it with the
standard setup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Q: After installation all my
CD&rsquo;s are reread from the internet. <br>
A: Run the following commands (from a script, if you
like)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cd ~/.cddb <br>
ln -s . blues <br>
ln -s . classical <br>
ln -s . country <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Q: Q3. Mike Oliphant&rsquo;s
grip creates cddb-files with track-artist held in a special
field called TARTIST0, TARTIST1, ... Why can&rsquo;t
disc-cover print these lables appropriately by the <br>
&quot;-va&quot; option? <br>
A: Unfortunately Mike&rsquo;s idea to invent new tags for
the track artist violates the freedb-conventions for
handling samplers. There will be no support for this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Q: How to cut the covers? <br>
A: This is my routine for jewel cases, just one way of doing
it. I start with the front cover. I cut it with two cuts
along the width of the paper. This results in a front cover
<br>
with two pieces of paper along the sides. These are folded
backwards to help the cover keep in place when it is
inserted in the jewel case. The back cover is just cut with
four <br>
cuts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Q: When I print my cover from
PDF in Acrobat Reader the resulting covers are too small.
How come? <br>
A: Hendrik Neumann &lt;h-n@gmx.net&gt;: The problem is the
option &rsquo;Fit to page&rsquo; that makes Acrobat Reader
scale the page before printing. Turn it off before
attempting to print.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Q: I&rsquo;m not root and I want
to install Audio::CD <br>
A: Adam Spiers &lt;adam@spiers.net&gt;: make sure that the
correct parameters are given to the perl Makefile.PL file as
follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perl Makefile.PL

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Q: How do I make covers for
double cds? <br>
A: Follow these steps:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. insert the second disc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Run disc-cover: <br>
disc-cover -t cddb -o disc2.cddb</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. replace the second disc with
the first</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. Run disc-cover again: <br>
disc-cover -2 disc2.cddb</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Q: The quality of the picture is
reduced! <br>
A: The image is resized to 200x200 pixels, this is to make
sure that the size of the resulting eps or pdf picture is
not too large. You can work around this by converting your
<br>
picture yourself, for example with jpeg2ps, and then
including this in your cover using the &rsquo;-pic&rsquo;
option. This options includes files as they are.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Q: I want Disc-Cover to have
this specific feature, what now? <br>
A: Send me an e-mail with your feature or better yet,
implement it yourself and send me a patch file. This does
not guarantee that your feature will be in any future
version <br>
though. I would like to keep Disc-Cover as simple to use as
possible. But, sometimes I can&rsquo;t resist to put in
something new, or the number of e-mails on one feature grows
large <br>
enough for me to add it to Disc-Cover.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Q: I run Disc-Cover and it does
not produce a correct cover, what&rsquo;s wrong? <br>
A: I don&rsquo;t know! If you e-mail the problem I can try
to fix it. When you mail some error please remember to state
the problem as exact as you can and to include the cddb
entry <br>
(save it with &rsquo;disc-cover -t cddb&rsquo;). Also, two
debug options are included. Use &quot;-V, -Verbose&quot; to
get verbose output of what the program is doing. This helps
me locate the problem <br>
if you email me your problem. Use &quot;-R, -Remove&quot; to
prevent disc-cover from deleting temporary files. This
enables you to examine intermediate files (.tex, .div,
pictures).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>

1. Whenever there is more than one file in the cddb cache
directory disc-cover will issue a warning and just use the
first one it found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Not possible to use CDINDEX
files as input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. The layout of the tracks can
be slightly deformed when special international characters
or any other tall characters appear in the title.</p>
