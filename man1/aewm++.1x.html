<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
aewm++ - a minimalistic window manager for X11</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
aewm++ -display [display], -fn [font], -fg|-bg|-bd [color],
-fm [follow|sloppy|click], -bw [width], -md [max desktops],
-tj [left|center|right], -es [true|false], -wm <br>
[true|false], -new1|-new2 [cmd], -usage, -help</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
aewm++ is an X11 window manager with a minimal set of
features. It provides the most common features found a
window manager. For instance you can iconify, maximize,
shade and <br>
close windows. You can separate your windows via virtual
desktops. Virtual desktops are separate workspaces in which
to perform work. Switching them is as easy as pressing <br>
alt+ctrl+page up or alt+ctrl+page down key combinations. By
default there are 4 virtual desktops.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">aewm++ was written from the aewm
source code. The reason behind this is simple. aewm is
probably the most popular window manager for hackers to fork
and hack on. Many window man&acirc; <br>
agers were written from its source. However the source code
is in C and there are hackers out there I am sure that would
like to hack a small window manager written in C++. Hence
<br>
aewm++ was born. While aewm has minimal features aewm++ will
try to build upon it with more features that the author
feels necessary in a good minimal window manager.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The titlebar has a lot of
functionality. Double clicking with the 1st button will
maximize a window. Double clicking a maximized window
returns it to its original size, Double <br>
clicking a shaded window unshades the window. Clicking with
the first button and dragging will move the window. Using
the middle button and clicking the titlebar will shade the
<br>
window. Do this again on a shaded window and it unshades it.
Middle clicking in the box on the right edge of the titlebar
will allow you to resize the window. Clicking with the <br>
1st button will iconify the window. Clicking with the 3rd
button will delete the window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If there are windows which are
iconified you can press the middle button on the root window
and it will pop up an icon menu. Clicking on items in the
icon menu will uniconify <br>
them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Virtual Desktops are cycled with
the page up and page down keys. If you don&rsquo;t specify
the -md [max number of desks] on the command line then you
will start with 4 virtual desk&acirc; <br>
tops. Currently there is no way to move windows back and
forth between desktops. There is also no such thing as
sticky windows yet in aewm++.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">aewm++ is meant to be used with
a 3 button mouse. If you don&rsquo;t have one feel free to
hack the code to change the functionality of the
buttons.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As of version 1.0.13 there is
now an icon menu. If you middle click on the root window you
will see the icon menu if you have clients that are
iconified. If no clients are iconi&acirc; <br>
fied you will see nothing. If you middle click on the root
window again while the menu is open it will hide. Icons for
the current desktop are the only ones that show. Once you
<br>
switch desktops whatever icons on that desktop will
show.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To get the real effect of aewm++
I highly recommend you use it with fspanel. This will give
you a nice task bar which will show icons, a clock and
buttons to switch virtual desk&acirc; <br>
tops.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-display display <br>
Specifies which display to start aewm++ on. This is useful
if you want to test aewm++ inside of Xnest.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-md number <br>
Specifies the number of max virtual desktops to start with.
The default number of desktops is 4.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-tj left|center|right <br>
Specifies the text justification for window titles in the
titlebar. The options are left, center or right.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-es true|false <br>
Specifies if edge snapping is turned on or not. Edge
snapping occurs when a window is dragged within 10 pixels of
the edge. It is then snapped to the edge. Specify true or
<br>
false with this option. Default is true.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-wm true|false <br>
Specifies if wire move is on or not. If its off then windows
are moved via an opaque move. In other words the entire
contents of the window are moved when the window is <br>
dragged. You specify true or false with this option. Default
is true.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fn font-spec <br>
Draw window titles with the user defined font.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fm follow|sloppy|click <br>
Defines what focus model you wish to use. The choices are
follow which is focus follows the mouse pointer, sloppy
provides focus follows mouse with the exception that the
<br>
root window doesn&rsquo;t get focus, and last but not least
there is click which provides the click to focus model.
Clicking on a window will give it focus until another client
<br>
is clicked then focus is transferred to that client. The
default value is &quot;click&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-bw width <br>
Defines how wide window borders will be.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-new1 cmd, -new2 cmd <br>
Change the command executed when each mouse button is
clicked on the root window. Button mouse-3, which is
modified with option -new2, runs &quot;x-terminal-emulator
-ls -sb <br>
-bg black -fg white&quot; by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fg color, -bg color, -bd color
<br>
Use color for the foreground, background, and borders of
window frames, respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-version <br>
