<i>mpicc</i> and <i>mpiCC</i> (<i>mpic++</i> is a synonym for <i>mpiCC</i>
  provided for filenames that do not support case-sensitive filenames) are
  convenience wrappers for the local native C and C++ compilers. Translation of
  a LAM program requires the linkage of the LAM specific libraries which may not
  reside in one of the standard search directories of ld(1). It also often
  requires the inclusion of header files what may also not be found in a
  standard location. <i>mpicc</i> passes its arguments to the local native C
  compiler along with the -I, -L and -l options required by LAM programs. This
  includes all necessary options for ROMIO and/or C++ bindings support (if
  ROMIO/C++ support was included when LAM was compiled).
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>mpiCC</i> (and therefore <i>mpic++</i>) is similar, but invokes the native
  C++ compiler instead.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The LAM Team <i>strongly</i> encourages using <i>mpicc</i> and <i>mpiCC</i>
  instead of attempting to link to the LAM libraries manually. This allows the
  specific implementation of LAM to change without forcing changes to linker
  directives in users' Makefiles (the specific set of underlying LAM libraries
  has already changed multiple times, and will likely change again in future
  versions).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Indeed, since <i>mpicc</i>/<i>mpiCC</i> are very thin wrappers on top of an
  underlying compiler, there are very, very few compelling reasons <i>not</i> to
  use <i>mpicc</i>/<i>mpiCC</i>. When it is not possible to use
  <i>mpicc</i>/<i>mpiCC</i>, the <i>-showme:compile</i> and <i>-showme:link</i>
  arguments should be used instead. For example:
<div class="Pp"></div>
shell$ cc -c file1.c `mpicc -showme:compile`
<div class="Pp"></div>
shell$ cc -c file2.c `mpicc -showme:compile`
<div class="Pp"></div>
shell$ cc file1.o file2.o `mpicc -showme:link` -o my_mpi_program
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES"><a class="selflink" href="#ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES">ENVIRONMENT
  VARIABLES</a></h1>
By default, <i>mpicc</i> uses the C compiler that was selected when LAM was
  configured (with the --with-cc flag to ./configure, or by setting the
  environment variable CC before ./configure was invoked) as the local native C
  compiler, but this can be overridden by the LAMMPICC environment variable (an
  older name for this environment variable is LAMHCC -- this also still works,
  but its use is deprecated).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Likewise, <i>mpiCC</i> uses the C++ compiler that was selected when LAM was
  configured (with the --with-cpp flag to ./configure, or by setting the
  environment variable CXX before invoking ./configure) by default, but this can
  be overridden by the LAMMPICXX environment variable (an older name for this
  environment variable is LAMHCP -- this also still works, but its use is
  deprecated).
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the environment variable <i>LAMHOME</i> is set, <i>mpicc</i> and <i>mpiCC</i>
  will use its value as the location of the LAM installation directory instead
  of the value that was compiled into <i>mpicc</i>/<i>mpiCC</i>. This means that
  <i>mpicc</i>/<i>mpiCC</i> will use the value of <i>LAMHOME</i> as the base to
  create the -I and -L arguments that are passed to the lower-level compiler,
  not the installation directory that was supplied when
  <i>mpicc</i>/<i>mpiCC</i> were created. This is almost always a Bad Idea.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The use of <i>LAMHOME</i> is discouraged except for some rare configuration
  cases in oddly networked sites (in which case your system administrator should
  probably set this up), and for advanced users with multiple LAM/MPI
  installations who really know what they are doing; if the <i>LAMHOME</i>
  environment variable is unintentionally left set, it can lead to tremendous
  user confusion. For example, if <i>LAMHOME</i> points to LAM installation A,
  but the user's <i>PATH</i> points to LAM installation B, then even though B's
  <i>mpicc</i> will be used, the user program will be compiled and linked
  against LAM installation A.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <i>LAMHOME</i> environment variable is mainly only left in place for
  backwards compatibility; it is not required for normal functioning of LAM/MPI.
  The LAM Team discourages the use of the <i>LAMHOME</i> environment variable,
  and instead advocates simply setting the <i>PATH</i> properly to switch
  between multiple LAM/MPI implementations.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="NOTES"><a class="selflink" href="#NOTES">NOTES</a></h1>
Previous versions of LAM encouraged the use of <i>hcc</i> and <i>hcp</i> to
  compile LAM and/or MPI C and C++ applications, respectively. In very old
  versions of LAM, <i>hcc</i> and <i>hcp</i> did not automatically add
  <i>-lmpi</i> to the command line. <i>hcc</i> and <i>hcp</i> were eventually
  deprecated and replaced with <i>mpicc</i> and <i>mpiCC</i> (or <i>mpic++</i>
  on case-insensitive filesystems). The executables <i>hcc</i> and <i>hcp</i>
  are now simply symbolic links to <i>mpicc</i> and <i>mpic++</i>, respectively,
  just in case there's anyone out there that still uses those names. It should
  be harmless to pass in the additional <i>-lmpi</i>; <i>mpicc</i> and
  <i>mpic++</i> should silently do the Right Thing (only link in the MPI library
  once).
