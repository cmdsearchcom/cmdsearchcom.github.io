<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This program is designed to help you generate and send bug
reports (and thank-you notes) about perl5 and the modules
which ship with it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In most cases, you can just run
it interactively from a command line without any special
arguments and follow the prompts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you have found a bug with a
non-standard port (one that was not part of the standard
distribution), a binary distribution, or a non-core module
(such as Tk, DBI, etc), then <br>
please see the documentation that came with that
distribution to determine the correct place to report
bugs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are unable to send your
report using perlbug (most likely because your system
doesn&rsquo;t have a way to send mail that perlbug
recognizes), you may be able to use this tool to <br>
compose your report and save it to a file which you can then
send to perlbug@perl.org using your regular mail client.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In extreme cases, perlbug may
not work well enough on your system to guide you through
composing a bug report. In those cases, you may be able to
use perlbug -d to get system <br>
configuration information to include in a manually composed
bug report to perlbug@perl.org.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When reporting a bug, please run
through this checklist:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">What version of Perl you are
running? <br>
Type &quot;perl -v&quot; at the command line to find
out.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Are you running the latest
released version of perl? <br>
Look at http://www.perl.org/ to find out. If you are not
using the latest released version, please try to replicate
your bug on the latest stable release.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that reports about bugs in
old versions of Perl, especially those which indicate you
haven&rsquo;t also tested the current stable release of
Perl, are likely to receive less <br>
attention from the volunteers who build and maintain Perl
than reports about bugs in the current release.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This tool isn&rsquo;t
appropriate for reporting bugs in any version prior to Perl
5.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Are you sure what you have is a
bug? <br>
A significant number of the bug reports we get turn out to
be documented features in Perl. Make sure the issue
you&rsquo;ve run into isn&rsquo;t intentional by glancing
through the <br>
documentation that comes with the Perl distribution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Given the sheer volume of Perl
documentation, this isn&rsquo;t a trivial undertaking, but
if you can point to documentation that suggests the
behaviour you&rsquo;re seeing is wrong, your <br>
issue is likely to receive more attention. You may want to
start with perldoc perltrap for pointers to common traps
that new (and experienced) Perl programmers run into.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you&rsquo;re unsure of the
meaning of an error message you&rsquo;ve run across, perldoc
perldiag for an explanation. If the message isn&rsquo;t in
perldiag, it probably isn&rsquo;t generated by <br>
Perl. You may have luck consulting your operating system
documentation instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are on a non-UNIX
platform perldoc perlport, as some features may be
unimplemented or work differently.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may be able to figure out
what&rsquo;s going wrong using the Perl debugger. For
information about how to use the debugger perldoc
perldebug.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Do you have a proper test case?
<br>
The easier it is to reproduce your bug, the more likely it
will be fixed -- if nobody can duplicate your problem, it
probably won&rsquo;t be addressed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A good test case has most of
these attributes: short, simple code; few dependencies on
external commands, modules, or libraries; no
platform-dependent code (unless it&rsquo;s a <br>
platform-specific bug); clear, simple documentation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A good test case is almost
always a good candidate to be included in Perl&rsquo;s test
suite. If you have the time, consider writing your test case
so that it can be easily <br>
included into the standard test suite.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Have you included all relevant
information? <br>
Be sure to include the exact error messages, if any.
&quot;Perl gave an error&quot; is not an exact error
message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you get a core dump (or
equivalent), you may use a debugger (dbx, gdb, etc) to
produce a stack trace to include in the bug report.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: unless your Perl has been
compiled with debug info (often -g), the stack trace is
likely to be somewhat hard to use because it will most
probably contain only the <br>
function names and not their arguments. If possible,
recompile your Perl with debug info and reproduce the crash
and the stack trace.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can you describe the bug in
plain English? <br>
The easier it is to understand a reproducible bug, the more
likely it will be fixed. Any insight you can provide into
the problem will help a great deal. In other words, <br>
try to analyze the problem (to the extent you can) and
report your discoveries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can you fix the bug yourself?
<br>
A bug report which includes a patch to fix it will almost
definitely be fixed. When sending a patch, please use the
&quot;diff&quot; program with the &quot;-u&quot; option to
generate &quot;unified&quot; <br>
diff files. Bug reports with patches are likely to receive
significantly more attention and interest than those without
patches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Your patch may be returned with
requests for changes, or requests for more detailed
explanations about your fix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here are a few hints for
creating high-quality patches:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Make sure the patch is not
reversed (the first argument to diff is typically the
original file, the second argument your changed file). Make
sure you test your patch by <br>
applying it with the &quot;patch&quot; program before you
send it on its way. Try to follow the same style as the code
you are trying to patch. Make sure your patch really does
work <br>
(&quot;make test&quot;, if the thing you&rsquo;re patching
is covered by Perl&rsquo;s test suite).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can you use &quot;perlbug&quot;
to submit the report? <br>
perlbug will, amongst other things, ensure your report
includes crucial information about your version of perl. If
&quot;perlbug&quot; is unable to mail your report after you
have <br>
typed it in, you may have to compose the message yourself,
add the output produced by &quot;perlbug -d&quot; and email
it to perlbug@perl.org. If, for some reason, you cannot run
<br>
&quot;perlbug&quot; at all on your system, be sure to
include the entire output produced by running &quot;perl
-V&quot; (note the uppercase V).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Whether you use
&quot;perlbug&quot; or send the email manually, please make
your Subject line informative. &quot;a bug&quot; is not
informative. Neither is &quot;perl crashes&quot; nor is
&quot;HELP!!!&quot;. <br>
These don&rsquo;t help. A compact description of
what&rsquo;s wrong is fine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can you use &quot;perlbug&quot;
to submit a thank-you note? <br>
Yes, you can do this by either using the &quot;-T&quot;
option, or by invoking the program as
&quot;perlthanks&quot;. Thank-you notes are good. It makes
people smile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Having done your bit, please be
prepared to wait, to be told the bug is in your code, or
possibly to get no reply at all. The volunteers who maintain
Perl are busy folks, so if <br>
your problem is an obvious bug in your own code, is
difficult to understand or is a duplicate of an existing
report, you may not receive a personal reply.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If it is important to you that
your bug be fixed, do monitor the perl5-porters@perl.org
mailing list and the commit logs to development versions of
Perl, and encourage the <br>
maintainers with kind words or offers of frosty beverages.
(Please do be kind to the maintainers. Harassing or flaming
them is likely to have the opposite effect of the one you
<br>
want.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Feel free to update the ticket
about your bug on http://rt.perl.org if a new version of
Perl is released and your bug is still present.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-a Address to send the report to. Defaults to
perlbug@perl.org.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A Don&rsquo;t send a bug
received acknowledgement to the reply address. Generally it
is only a sensible to use this option if you are a perl
maintainer actively watching perl <br>
porters for your message to arrive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b Body of the report. If not
included on the command line, or in a file with -f, you will
get a chance to edit the message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C Don&rsquo;t send copy to
administrator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Address to send copy of
report to. Defaults to the address of the local perl
administrator (recorded when perl was built).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Data mode (the default if you
redirect or pipe output). This prints out your configuration
data, without mailing anything. You can use this with -v to
get more complete <br>
data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e Editor to use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f File containing the body of
the report. Use this to quickly send a prepared message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F File to output the results to
instead of sending as an email. Useful particularly when
running perlbug on a machine with no direct internet
connection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Prints a brief summary of the
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ok Report successful build on
this system to perl porters. Forces -S and -C. Forces and
supplies values for -s and -b. Only prompts for a return
address if it cannot guess <br>
it (for use with make). Honors return address specified with
-r. You can use this with -v to get more complete data. Only
makes a report if this system is less than 60 <br>
days old.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-okay As -ok except it will
report on older systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nok Report unsuccessful build
on this system. Forces -C. Forces and supplies a value for
-s, then requires you to edit the report and say what went
wrong. Alternatively, a <br>
prepared report may be supplied using -f. Only prompts for a
return address if it cannot guess it (for use with make).
Honors return address specified with -r. You can <br>
use this with -v to get more complete data. Only makes a
report if this system is less than 60 days old.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nokay As -nok except it will
report on older systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Your return address. The
program will ask you to confirm its default if you
don&rsquo;t use this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S Send without asking for
confirmation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Subject to include with the
message. You will be prompted if you don&rsquo;t supply one
on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Test mode. The target address
defaults to perlbug-test@perl.org.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T Send a thank-you note instead
of a bug report.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Include verbose configuration
data in the report.</p>
