<p>Xvnc(1) Virtual Network Computing Xvnc(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
Xvnc - the X VNC server</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
Xvnc [options] :display#</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Xvnc is the X VNC (Virtual Network Computing) server. It is
based on a standard X server, but it has a
&quot;virtual&quot; screen rather than a physical one. X
applications display them&acirc; <br>
selves on it as if it were a normal X display, but they can
only be accessed via a VNC viewer - see vncviewer(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">So Xvnc is really two servers in
one. To the applications it is an X server, and to the
remote VNC users it is a VNC server. By convention we have
arranged that the VNC server <br>
display number will be the same as the X server display
number, which means you can use eg. snoopy:2 to refer to
display 2 on machine &quot;snoopy&quot; in both the X world
and the VNC <br>
world.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The best way of starting Xvnc is
via the vncserver script. This sets up the environment
appropriately and runs some X applications to get you going.
See the manual page for <br>
vncserver(1) for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Xvnc takes lots of options - running Xvnc -help gives a
list. Many of these are standard X server options, which are
described in the Xserver(1) manual page. In addition to <br>
options which can only be set via the command-line, there
are also &quot;parameters&quot; which can be set both via
the command-line and through the vncconfig(1) program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-geometry widthxheight <br>
Specify the size of the desktop to be created. Default is
1024x768.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-depth depth <br>
Specify the pixel depth in bits of the desktop to be
created. Default is 24, other possible values are 8, 15, and
16 - anything else is likely to cause strange behaviour <br>
by applications.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pixelformat format <br>
Specify pixel format for server to use (BGRnnn or RGBnnn).
The default for depth 8 is BGR233 (meaning the most
significant two bits represent blue, the next three green,
<br>
and the least significant three represent red), the default
for depth 16 is RGB565 and for depth 24 is RGB888.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-interface IP address or -i IP
address <br>
Listen on interface. By default Xvnc listens on all
available interfaces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-cc 3 As an alternative to the
default TrueColor visual, this allows you to run an Xvnc
server with a PseudoColor visual (i.e. one which uses a
color map or palette), which can <br>
be useful for running some old X applications which only
work on such a display. Values other than 3 (PseudoColor)
and 4 (TrueColor) for the -cc option may result in <br>
strange behaviour, and PseudoColor desktops must be 8 bits
deep (i.e. -depth 8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-inetd This significantly
changes Xvnc&rsquo;s behaviour so that it can be launched
from inetd. See the section below on usage with inetd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-help List all the options and
parameters</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PARAMETERS <br>
VNC parameters can be set both via the command-line and
through the vncconfig(1) program, and with a VNC-enabled
Xorg server via Options entries in the xorg.conf file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Parameters can be turned on with
-param or off with -param=0. Parameters which take a value
can be specified as -param value. Other valid forms are
param=value -param=value <br>
--param=value. Parameter names are case-insensitive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-desktop desktop-name <br>
Each desktop has a name which may be displayed by the
viewer. It defaults to &quot;x11&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-rfbport port <br>
Specifies the TCP port on which Xvnc listens for connections
from viewers (the protocol used in VNC is called RFB -
&quot;remote framebuffer&quot;). The default is 5900 plus
the <br>
display number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-rfbwait time,
-ClientWaitTimeMillis time</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Time in milliseconds to wait for
a viewer which is blocking Xvnc. This is necessary because
Xvnc is single-threaded and sometimes blocks until the
viewer has finished <br>
sending or receiving a message - note that this does not
mean an update will be aborted after this time. Default is
20000 (20 seconds).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-httpd directory <br>
Run a mini-HTTP server which serves files from the given
directory. Normally the directory will contain the classes
for the Java viewer. In addition, files with a .vnc <br>
extension will have certain substitutions made so that a
single installation of the Java VNC viewer can be served by
separate instances of Xvnc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-httpPort port <br>
Specifies the port on which the mini-HTTP server runs.
Default is 5800 plus the display number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-rfbauth passwd-file,
-PasswordFile passwd-file <br>
Specifies the file containing the password used to
authenticate viewers. The file is accessed each time a
connection comes in, so it can be changed on the fly via
vnc&acirc; <br>
passwd(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-deferUpdate time <br>
Xvnc uses a &quot;deferred update&quot; mechanism which
enhances performance in many cases. After any change to the
framebuffer, Xvnc waits for this number of milliseconds
(default <br>
1) before sending an update to any waiting clients. This
means that more changes tend to get coalesced together in a
single update. Setting it to 0 results in the same be&acirc;
<br>
haviour as earlier versions of Xvnc, where the first change
to the framebuffer causes an immediate update to any waiting
clients.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-SendCutText <br>
Send clipboard changes to clients (default is on). Note that
you must also run vncconfig(1) to get the clipboard to
work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-AcceptCutText <br>
Accept clipboard updates from clients (default is on). Note
that you must also run vncconfig(1) to get the clipboard to
work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-AcceptPointerEvents <br>
Accept pointer press and release events from clients
(default is on).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-AcceptKeyEvents <br>
Accept key press and release events from clients (default is
on).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-DisconnectClients <br>
Disconnect existing clients if an incoming connection is
non-shared (default is on). If DisconnectClients is false,
then a new non-shared connection will be refused while <br>
there is a client active. When combined with NeverShared
this means only one client is allowed at a time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-NeverShared <br>
Never treat incoming connections as shared, regardless of
the client-specified setting (default is off).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-AlwaysShared <br>
Always treat incoming connections as shared, regardless of
the client-specified setting (default is off).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Protocol3.3 <br>
Always use protocol version 3.3 for backwards compatibility
with badly-behaved clients (default is off).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-CompareFB <br>
Perform pixel comparison on framebuffer to reduce
unnecessary updates (default is on).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-SecurityTypes sec-types <br>
Specify which security schemes to use separated by commas.
At present only &quot;None&quot; and &quot;VncAuth&quot; are
supported. The default is &quot;VncAuth&quot; - note that if
you want a server <br>
which does not require a password, you must set this
parameter to &quot;None&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-IdleTimeout seconds <br>
The number of seconds after which an idle VNC connection
will be dropped (default is 0, which means that idle
connections will never be dropped).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-QueryConnect <br>
Prompts the user of the desktop to explicitly accept or
reject incoming connections. This is most useful when using
the vnc.so module or x0vncserver(1) program to access <br>
an existing X desktop via VNC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The vncconfig(1) program must be
running on the desktop in order for QueryConnect to be
supported by the vnc.so(1) module or Xvnc(1) program. The
x0vncserver(1) program <br>
does not require vncconfig(1) to be running.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-localhost <br>
Only allow connections from the same machine. Useful if you
use SSH and want to stop non-SSH connections from any other
hosts. See the guide to using VNC with SSH on the <br>
web site.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-log logname:dest:level <br>
Configures the debug log settings. dest can currently be
stderr or stdout, and level is between 0 and 100, 100
meaning most verbose output. logname is usually * meaning
<br>
all, but you can target a specific source file if you know
the name of its &quot;LogWriter&quot;. Default is
*:stderr:30.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-RemapKeys mapping <br>
Sets up a keyboard mapping. mapping is a comma-separated
string of character mappings, each of the form
char-&gt;char, or char&lt;&gt;char, where char is a
hexadecimal keysym. For <br>
example, to exchange the &quot; and @ symbols you would
specify the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RemapKeys=0x22&lt;&gt;0x40</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USAGE WITH INETD <br>
By configuring the inetd(1) service appropriately, Xvnc can
be launched on demand when a connection comes in, rather
than having to be started manually. When given the -inetd
<br>
option, instead of listening for TCP connections on a given
port it uses its standard input and standard output. There
are two modes controlled by the wait/nowait entry in the
<br>
inetd.conf file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the nowait mode, Xvnc uses
its standard input and output directly as the connection to
a viewer. It never has a listening socket, so cannot accept
further connections from <br>
viewers (it can however connect out to listening viewers by
use of the vncconfig program). Further viewer connections to
the same TCP port result in inetd spawning off a new <br>
Xvnc to deal with each connection. When the connection to
the viewer dies, the Xvnc and any associated X clients die.
This behaviour is most useful when combined with the XDMCP
<br>
options -query and -once. An typical example in inetd.conf
might be (all on one line):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5950 stream tcp nowait nobody
/usr/local/bin/Xvnc Xvnc -inetd -query localhost -once
securitytypes=none</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In this example a viewer
connection to :50 will result in a new Xvnc for that
connection which should display the standard XDM login
screen on that machine. Because the user <br>
needs to login via XDM, it is usually OK to accept
connections without a VNC password in this case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the wait mode, when the first
connection comes in, inetd gives the listening socket to
Xvnc. This means that for a given TCP port, there is only
ever one Xvnc at a time. <br>
Further viewer connections to the same port are accepted by
the same Xvnc in the normal way. Even when the original
connection is broken, the Xvnc will continue to run. If this
<br>
is used with the XDMCP options -query and -once, the Xvnc
and associated X clients will die when the user logs out of
the X session in the normal way. It is important to use a
<br>
VNC password in this case. A typical entry in inetd.conf
might be:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5951 stream tcp wait james
/usr/local/bin/Xvnc Xvnc -inetd -query localhost -once
passwordFile=/home/james/.vnc/passwd</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In fact typically, you would
have one entry for each user who uses VNC regularly, each of
whom has their own dedicated TCP port which they use. In
this example, when user <br>
&quot;james&quot; connects to :51, he enters his VNC
password, then gets the XDM login screen where he logs in in
the normal way. However, unlike the previous example, if he
disconnects, <br>
the session remains persistent, and when he reconnects he
will get the same session back again. When he logs out of
the X session, the Xvnc will die, but of course a new one
<br>
will be created automatically the next time he connects.</p>
