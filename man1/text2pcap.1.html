<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Text2pcap is a program that reads in an ASCII hex dump and
writes the data described into a pcap capture file.
text2pcap can read hexdumps with multiple packets in them,
and <br>
build a capture file of multiple packets. text2pcap is also
capable of generating dummy Ethernet, IP and UDP, TCP, or
SCTP headers, in order to build fully processable packet
<br>
dumps from hexdumps of application-level data only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Text2pcap understands a hexdump
of the form generated by od -Ax -tx1 -v. In other words,
each byte is individually displayed and surrounded with a
space. Each line begins with <br>
an offset describing the position in the file. The offset is
a hex number (can also be octal or decimal - see -o), of
more than two hex digits. Here is a sample dump that <br>
text2pcap can recognize:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">000000 00 e0 1e a7 05 6f 00 10
........ <br>
000008 5a a0 b9 12 08 00 46 00 ........ <br>
000010 03 68 00 00 00 00 0a 2e ........ <br>
000018 ee 33 0f 19 08 7f 0f 19 ........ <br>
000020 03 80 94 04 00 00 10 01 ........ <br>
000028 16 a2 0a 00 03 50 00 0c ........ <br>
000030 01 01 0f 19 03 80 11 01 ........</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is no limit on the width
or number of bytes per line. Also the text dump at the end
of the line is ignored. Bytes/hex numbers can be uppercase
or lowercase. Any text before <br>
the offset is ignored, including email forwarding characters
&rsquo;&gt;&rsquo;. Any lines of text between the bytestring
lines is ignored. The offsets are used to track the bytes,
so offsets <br>
must be correct. Any line which has only bytes without a
leading offset is ignored. An offset is recognized as being
a hex number longer than two characters. Any text after the
<br>
bytes is ignored (e.g. the character dump). Any hex numbers
in this text are also ignored. An offset of zero is
indicative of starting a new packet, so a single text file
with a <br>
series of hexdumps can be converted into a packet capture
with multiple packets. Packets may be preceded by a
timestamp. These are interpreted according to the format
given on <br>
the command line (see -t). If not, the first packet is
timestamped with the current time the conversion takes
place. Multiple packets are written with timestamps
differing by one <br>
microsecond each. In general, short of these restrictions,
text2pcap is pretty liberal about reading in hexdumps and
has been tested with a variety of mangled outputs (including
<br>
being forwarded through email multiple times, with limited
line wrap etc.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are a couple of other
special features to note. Any line where the first
non-whitespace character is &rsquo;#&rsquo; will be ignored
as a comment. Any line beginning with #TEXT2PCAP is <br>
a directive and options can be inserted after this command
to be processed by text2pcap. Currently there are no
directives implemented; in the future, these may be used to
give <br>
more fine grained control on the dump and the way it should
be processed e.g. timestamps, encapsulation type etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Text2pcap also allows the user
to read in dumps of application-level data, by inserting
dummy L2, L3 and L4 headers before each packet. The user can
elect to insert Ethernet <br>
headers, Ethernet and IP, or Ethernet, IP and UDP/TCP/SCTP
headers before each packet. This allows Wireshark or any
other full-packet decoder to handle these dumps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-a Enables ASCII text dump identification. It allows to
identify the start of the ASCII text dump and not include it
in the packet even if it looks like HEX.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: Do not enable it if the
input file does not contain the ASCII text dump.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Displays debugging
information during the process. Can be used multiple times
to generate more debugging information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D The text before the packet
starts either with an I or O indicating that the packet is
inbound or outbound. This is only stored if the output
format is PCAP-NG.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e &lt;l3pid&gt; <br>
Include a dummy Ethernet header before each packet. Specify
the L3PID for the Ethernet header in hex. Use this option if
your dump has Layer 3 header and payload (e.g. IP <br>
header), but no Layer 2 encapsulation. Example: -e 0x806 to
specify an ARP packet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For IP packets, instead of
generating a fake Ethernet header you can also use -l 101 to
indicate a raw IP packet to Wireshark. Note that -l 101 does
not work for any non-IP <br>
Layer 3 packet (e.g. ARP), whereas generating a dummy
Ethernet header with -e works for any sort of L3 packet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Displays a help message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i &lt;proto&gt; <br>
Include dummy IP headers before each packet. Specify the IP
protocol for the packet in decimal. Use this option if your
dump is the payload of an IP packet (i.e. has complete <br>
L4 information) but does not have an IP header with each
packet. Note that an appropriate Ethernet header is
automatically included with each packet as well. Example: -i
46 <br>
to specify an RSVP packet (IP protocol 46).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l Specify the link-layer header
type of this packet. Default is Ethernet (1). See
&lt;http://www.tcpdump.org/linktypes.html&gt; for the
complete list of possible encapsulations. <br>
Note that this option should be used if your dump is a
complete hex dump of an encapsulated packet and you wish to
specify the exact type of encapsulation. Example: -l 7 for
<br>
ARCNet packets encapsulated BSD-style.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m &lt;max-packet&gt; <br>
Set the maximum packet length, default is 65535. Useful for
testing various packet boundaries when only an application
level datastream is available. Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">od -Ax -tx1 -v stream |
text2pcap -m1460 -T1234,1234 - stream.pcap</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will convert from plain
datastream format to a sequence of Ethernet TCP packets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Write PCAP-NG file instead of
a PCAP.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o hex|oct|dec <br>
Specify the radix for the offsets (hex, octal or decimal).
Defaults to hex. This corresponds to the &quot;-A&quot;
option for od.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Be completely quiet during
the process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s
&lt;srcport&gt;,&lt;destport&gt;,&lt;tag&gt; <br>
Include dummy SCTP headers before each packet. Specify, in
decimal, the source and destination SCTP ports, and
verification tag, for the packet. Use this option if your
<br>
dump is the SCTP payload of a packet but does not include
any SCTP, IP or Ethernet headers. Note that appropriate
Ethernet and IP headers are automatically also included <br>
with each packet. A CRC32C checksum will be put into the
SCTP header.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S
&lt;srcport&gt;,&lt;destport&gt;,&lt;ppi&gt; <br>
Include dummy SCTP headers before each packet. Specify, in
decimal, the source and destination SCTP ports, and a
verification tag of 0, for the packet, and prepend a dummy
<br>
SCTP DATA chunk header with a payload protocol identifier if
ppi. Use this option if your dump is the SCTP payload of a
packet but does not include any SCTP, IP or Ethernet <br>
headers. Note that appropriate Ethernet and IP headers are
automatically included with each packet. A CRC32C checksum
will be put into the SCTP header.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t &lt;timefmt&gt; <br>
Treats the text before the packet as a date/time code;
timefmt is a format string of the sort supported by
strptime(3). Example: The time &quot;10:15:14.5476&quot; has
the format code <br>
&quot;%H:%M:%S.&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: The subsecond component
delimiter must be specified (.) but no pattern is required;
the remaining number is assumed to be fractions of a
second.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: Date/time fields from the
current date/time are used as the default for unspecified
fields.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T
&lt;srcport&gt;,&lt;destport&gt; <br>
Include dummy TCP headers before each packet. Specify the
source and destination TCP ports for the packet in decimal.
Use this option if your dump is the TCP payload of a <br>
packet but does not include any TCP, IP or Ethernet headers.
Note that appropriate Ethernet and IP headers are
automatically also included with each packet. Sequence
numbers <br>
will start at 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u
&lt;srcport&gt;,&lt;destport&gt; <br>
Include dummy UDP headers before each packet. Specify the
source and destination UDP ports for the packet in decimal.
Use this option if your dump is the UDP payload of a <br>
packet but does not include any UDP, IP or Ethernet headers.
Note that appropriate Ethernet and IP headers are
automatically also included with each packet. Example: <br>
-u1000,69 to make the packets look like TFTP/UDP
packets.</p>
