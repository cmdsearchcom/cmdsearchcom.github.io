<p>SGE_INTRO(1) Grid Engine User Commands SGE_INTRO(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
sge_intro - Grid Engine, a facility for executing jobs on
remote machines</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Grid Engine is a facility for executing Unix-like batch jobs
(shell scripts or binaries) on a pool of cooperating CPUs.
Jobs are queued and executed remotely according to defined
<br>
policies. The CPUs may be in desktop systems, with jobs run
on them at times when they would otherwise be idle or only
lightly loaded. The work load may be distributed according
<br>
to the (generalized) load situation of each machine and the
resource requirements of the jobs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">User level checkpointing
programs are supported and a transparent checkpointing
mechanism is provided (see sge_ckpt(1)). Checkpointing jobs
migrate from system to system without <br>
user intervention on load demand. In addition to simple
batch jobs, interactive jobs and parallel jobs can also be
submitted to Grid Engine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USER INTERFACE <br>
The Grid Engine user interface consists of several programs
which are described separately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">qacct(1) <br>
qacct extracts arbitrary accounting information from the
cluster logfile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">qalter(1) <br>
qalter changes the characteristics of already submitted
jobs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">qconf(1) <br>
qconf provides the user interface for configuring,
modifying, deleting and querying queues and the cluster
configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">qdel(1) <br>
qdel provides the means for a user/operator/manager to
cancel jobs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">qevent(1) <br>
qevent provides a means of watching Grid Engine events and
acting on jobs finishing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">qhold(1) <br>
qhold holds back submitted jobs from execution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">qhost(1) <br>
qhost displays status information about Grid Engine
execution hosts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">qlogin(1) <br>
qlogin initiates a telnet or similar login session with
automatic selection of a suitable host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">qmake(1) <br>
qmake is a replacement for the standard Unix make facility.
It extends make with an ability to distribute independent
make steps across a cluster of suitable machines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">qmod(1) <br>
qmod allows the owner(s) of a queue to suspend and enable
queues, e.g. all queues associated with his machine (all
currently active processes in this queue are also sig&acirc;
<br>
naled) or to suspend and enable jobs executing in the
queues.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">qmon(1) <br>
qmon provides a Motif command interface to all Grid Engine
functions. The status of all, or a private selection of, the
configured queues is displayed on-line by changing <br>
colors at corresponding queue icons.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">qping(1) <br>
qping can be used to check the status of Grid Engine
daemons.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">qquota(1) <br>
qquota provides a status listing of all currently used
resource quotas (see sge_resource_quota(5)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">qresub(1) <br>
qresub creates new jobs by copying currently running or
pending jobs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">qrls(1) <br>
qrls releases holds from jobs previously assigned to them
e.g. via qhold(1) (see above).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">qrdel(1) <br>
qrdel provides the means to cancel advance reservations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">qrsh(1) <br>
qrsh can be used for various purposes such as providing
remote execution of interactive applications via Grid Engine
comparable to the standard Unix facility rsh, to allow <br>
for the submission of batch jobs which, upon execution,
support terminal I/O (standard/error output and standard
input) and terminal control, to provide a batch job
sub&acirc; <br>
mission client which remains active until the job has
finished or to allow for the Grid Engine-controlled remote
execution of the tasks of parallel jobs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">qrstat(1) <br>
qrstat provides a status listing of all advance reservations
in the cluster.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">qrsub(1) <br>
qrsub is the user interface for submitting an advance
reservation to Grid Engine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">qselect(1) <br>
qselect prints a list of queue names corresponding to
specified selection criteria. The output of qselect is
usually fed into other Grid Engine commands to apply actions
<br>
on a selected set of queues.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">qsh(1) qsh opens an interactive
shell (in an xterm(1)) on a low loaded host. Any kind of
interactive job can be run in this shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">qstat(1) <br>
qstat provides a status listing of all jobs and queues
associated with the cluster.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">qtcsh(1) <br>
qtcsh is a fully compatible replacement for the widely known
and used Unix C-Shell (csh) derivative tcsh. It provides a
command-shell with the extension of transparently <br>
distributing execution of designated applications to
suitable and lightly loaded hosts via Grid Engine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">qsub(1) <br>
qsub is the user interface for submitting a job to Grid
Engine.</p>
