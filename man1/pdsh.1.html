<p>pdsh(1) General Commands Manual pdsh(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pdsh - issue commands to groups of hosts in parallel</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pdsh [options]... command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
pdsh is a variant of the rsh(1) command. Unlike rsh(1),
which runs commands on a single remote host, pdsh can run
multiple remote commands in parallel. pdsh uses a
&quot;sliding win&acirc; <br>
dow&quot; (or fanout) of threads to conserve resources on
the initiating host while allowing some connections to time
out.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When pdsh receives SIGINT
(ctrl-C), it lists the status of current threads. A second
SIGINT within one second terminates the program. Pending
threads may be canceled by issuing <br>
ctrl-Z within one second of ctrl-C. Pending threads are
those that have not yet been initiated, or are still in the
process of connecting to the remote host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a remote command is not
specified on the command line, pdsh runs interactively,
prompting for commands and executing them when terminated
with a carriage return. In interac&acirc; <br>
tive mode, target nodes that time out on the first command
are not contacted for subsequent commands, and commands
prefixed with an exclamation point will be executed on the
<br>
local system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The core functionality of pdsh
may be supplemented by dynamically loadable modules. The
modules may provide a new connection protocol (replacing the
standard rcmd(3) protocol <br>
used by rsh(1)), filtering options (e.g. removing hosts that
are &quot;down&quot; from the target list), and/or host
selection options (e.g., -a selects all hosts from a
configuration <br>
file.). By default, pdsh must have at least one
&quot;rcmd&quot; module loaded. See the RCMD MODULES section
for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RCMD MODULES <br>
The method by which pdsh runs commands on remote hosts may
be selected at runtime using the -R option (See OPTIONS
below). This functionality is ultimately implemented via
<br>
dynamically loadable modules, and so the list of available
options may be different from installation to installation.
A list of currently available rcmd modules is printed when
<br>
using any of the -h, -V, or -L options. The default rcmd
module will also be displayed with the -h and -V
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A list of rcmd modules currently
distributed with pdsh follows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rsh Uses an internal,
thread-safe implementation of BSD rcmd(3) to run commands
using the standard rsh(1) protocol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">exec Executes an arbitrary
command for each target host. The first of the pdsh remote
arguments is the local command to execute, followed by any
further arguments. Some simple <br>
parameters are substitued on the command line, including %h
for the target hostname, %u for the remote username, and %n
for the remote rank [0-n] (To get a literal % use <br>
%%). For example, the following would duplicate using the
ssh module to run hostname(1) across the hosts
foo[0-10]:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pdsh -R exec -w foo[0-10] ssh -x
-l %u %h hostname</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and this command line would run
grep(1) in parallel across the files console.foo[0-10]:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pdsh -R exec -w foo[0-10] grep
BUG console.%h</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ssh Uses a variant of popen(3)
to run multiple copies of the ssh(1) command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mrsh This module uses the
mrsh(1) protocol to execute jobs on remote hosts. The mrsh
protocol uses a credential based authentication, forgoing
the need to allocate reserved <br>
ports. In other aspects, it acts just like rsh. Remote nodes
must be running mrshd(8) in order for the mrsh module to
work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">qsh Allows pdsh to execute MPI
jobs over QsNet. Qshell propagates the current working
directory, pdsh environment, and Elan capabilities to the
remote process. The following <br>
environment variable are also appended to the environment:
RMS_RANK, RMS_NODEID, RMS_PROCID, RMS_NNODES, and
RMS_NPROCS. Since pdsh needs to run setuid root for qshell
<br>
support, qshell does not directly support propagation of
LD_LIBRARY_PATH and LD_PREOPEN. Instead the
QSHELL_REMOTE_LD_LIBRARY_PATH and QSHELL_REMOTE_LD_PREOPEN
environ&acirc; <br>
ment variables will may be used and will be remapped to
LD_LIBRARY_PATH and LD_PREOPEN by the qshell daemon if
set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mqsh Similar to qshell, but uses
the mrsh protocol instead of the rsh protocol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">krb4 The krb4 module allows
users to execute remote commands after authenticating with
kerberos. Of course, the remote rshd daemons must be
kerberized.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xcpu The xcpu module uses the
xcpu service to execute remote commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The list of available options is determined at runtime by
supplementing the list of standard pdsh options with any
options provided by loaded rcmd and misc modules. In some
<br>
cases, options provided by modules may conflict with each
other. In these cases, the modules are incompatible and the
first module loaded wins.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Standard target nodelist options
<br>
-w TARGETS,... <br>
Target and or filter the specified list of hosts. Do not use
with any other node selection options (e.g. -a, -g, if they
are available). No spaces are allowed in the <br>
comma-separated list. Arguments in the TARGETS list may
include normal host names, a range of hosts in hostlist
format (See HOSTLIST EXPRESSIONS), or a single
&lsquo;-&rsquo; charac&acirc; <br>
ter to read the list of hosts on stdin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a host or hostlist is
preceded by a &lsquo;-&rsquo; character, this causes those
hosts to be explicitly excluded. If the argument is preceded
by a single &lsquo;^&rsquo; character, it is taken <br>
to be the path to file containing a list of hosts, one per
line. If the item begins with a &lsquo;/&rsquo; character,
it is taken as a regular expression on which to filter the
list <br>
of hosts (a regex argument may also be optionally trailed by
another &rsquo;/&rsquo;, e.g. /node.*/). A regex or file
name argument may also be preceeded by a minus
&lsquo;-&rsquo; to exclude <br>
instead of include thoses hosts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A list of hosts may also be
preceded by &quot;user@&quot; to specify a remote username
other than the default, or &quot;rcmd_type:&quot; to specify
an alternate rcmd connection type for these <br>
hosts. When used together, the rcmd type must be specified
first, e.g. &quot;ssh:user1@host0&quot; would use ssh to
connect to host0 as user &quot;user1.&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x host,host,... <br>
Exclude the specified hosts. May be specified in conjunction
with other target node list options such as -a and -g (when
available). Hostlists may also be specified to the <br>
-x option (see the HOSTLIST EXPRESSIONS section below).
Arguments to -x may also be preceeded by the filename
(&lsquo;^&rsquo;) and regex (&rsquo;/&rsquo;) characters as
described above, in which <br>
case the resulting hosts are excluded as if they had been
given to -w and preceeded with the minus &lsquo;-&rsquo;
character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Standard pdsh options <br>
-S Return the largest of the remote command return
values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Output usage menu and quit. A
list of available rcmd modules will also be printed at the
end of the usage message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Only on AIX, separate remote
command stderr and stdout into two sockets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q List option values and the
target nodelist and exit without action.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b Disable ctrl-C status feature
so that a single ctrl-C kills parallel job. (Batch Mode)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l user <br>
This option may be used to run remote commands as another
user, subject to authorization. For BSD rcmd, this means the
invoking user and system must be listed in the <br>
user&Acirc;&acute;s .rhosts file (even for root).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t seconds <br>
Set the connect timeout. Default is 10 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u seconds <br>
Set a limit on the amount of time a remote command is
allowed to execute. Default is no limit. See note in
LIMITATIONS if using -u with ssh.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f number <br>
Set the maximum number of simultaneous remote commands to
number. The default is 32.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R name <br>
Set rcmd module to name. This option may also be set via the
PDSH_RCMD_TYPE environment variable. A list of available
rcmd modules may be obtained via the -h, -V, or -L <br>
options. The default will be listed with -h or -V.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M name,... <br>
When multiple misc modules provide the same options to pdsh,
the first module initialized &quot;wins&quot; and subsequent
modules are not loaded. The -M option allows a list of <br>
modules to be specified that will be force-initialized
before all others, in-effect ensuring that they load without
conflict (unless they conflict with eachother). This <br>
option may also be set via the PDSH_MISC_MODULES environment
variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L List info on all loaded pdsh
modules and quit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N Disable hostname: prefix on
lines of output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Include more complete thread
status when SIGINT is received, and display connect and
command time statistics on stderr when done.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Output pdsh version
information, along with list of currently loaded modules,
and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">qsh/mqsh module options <br>
-n tasks_per_node <br>
Set the number of tasks spawned per node. Default is 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m block | cyclic <br>
Set block versus cyclic allocation of processes to nodes.
Default is block.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r railmask <br>
Set the rail bitmask for a job on a multirail system. The
default railmask is 1, which corresponds to rail 0 only.
Each bit set in the argument to -r corresponds to a rail
<br>
on the system, so a value of 2 would correspond to rail 1
only, and 3 would indicate to use both rail 1 and rail
0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">machines module options <br>
-a Target all nodes from machines file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">genders module options <br>
In addition to the genders options presented below, the
genders attribute pdsh_rcmd_type may also be used in the
genders database to specify an alternate rcmd connect type
than <br>
the pdsh default for hosts with this attribute. For example,
the following line in the genders file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">host0 pdsh_rcmd_type=ssh</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">would cause pdsh to use ssh to
connect to host0, even if rsh were the default. This can be
overridden on the commandline with the
&quot;rcmd_type:host0&quot; syntax.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A Target all nodes in genders
database. The -A option will target every host listed in
genders -- if you want to omit some hosts by default, see
the -a option below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a Target all nodes in genders
database except those with the &quot;pdsh_all_skip&quot;
attribute. This is shorthand for running &quot;pdsh -A -X
pdsh_all_skip ...&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g attr[=val][,attr[=val],...]
<br>
Target nodes that match any of the specified genders
attributes (with optional values). Conflicts with the -a
option. If used in combination with other node selection
<br>
options like -w, the -g option will select from the supplied
node list, instead of from the genders file as a whole.
Otherwise, This option targets the alternate hostnames <br>
in the genders database by default. The -i option provided
by the genders module may be used to translate these to the
canonical genders hostnames. If the installed ver&acirc;
<br>
sion of genders supports it, attributes supplied to -g may
also take the form of genders queries. Genders queries will
query the genders database for the union, intersec&acirc;
<br>
tion, difference, or complement of genders attributes and
values. The set operation union is represented by two pipe
symbols (&rsquo;||&rsquo;), intersection by two ampersand
symbols <br>
(&rsquo;&amp;&amp;&rsquo;), difference by two minus symbols
(&rsquo;--&rsquo;), and complement by a tilde
(&rsquo;~&rsquo;). Parentheses may be used to change the
order of operations. See the nodeattr(1) manpage <br>
for examples of genders queries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X attr[=val][,attr[=val],...]
<br>
Exclude nodes that match any of the specified genders
attributes (optionally with values). This option may be used
in combination with any other of the node selection <br>
options (e.g. -w, -g, -a, -X may also take the form of
genders queries. Please see documentation for the genders -g
option for more information about genders queries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i Request translation between
canonical and alternate hostnames.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F filename <br>
Read genders information from filename instead of the system
default genders file. If filename doesn&rsquo;t specify an
absolute path then it is taken to be relative to the <br>
directory specified by the PDSH_GENDERS_DIR environment
variable (/etc by default). An alternate genders file may
also be specified via the PDSH_GENDERS_FILE environment <br>
variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nodeupdown module options <br>
-v Eliminate target nodes that are considered
&quot;down&quot; by libnodeupdown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">slurm module options <br>
The slurm module allows pdsh to target nodes based on
currently running SLURM jobs. The slurm module is typically
called after all other node selection options have been
pro&acirc; <br>
cessed, and if no nodes have been selected, the module will
attempt to read a running jobid from the SLURM_JOBID
environment variable (which is set when running under a
SLURM <br>
allocation). If SLURM_JOBID references an invalid job, it
will be silently ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-j jobid[,jobid,...] <br>
Target list of nodes allocated to the SLURM job jobid. This
option may be used multiple times to target multiple SLURM
jobs. The special argument &quot;all&quot; can be used to
tar&acirc; <br>
get all nodes running SLURM jobs, e.g. -j all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P partition[,partition,...]
<br>
Target list of nodes containing in the SLURM partition
partition. This option may be used multiple times to target
multiple SLURM partitions and/or partitions may be <br>
given in a comma-delimited list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">torque module options <br>
The torque module allows pdsh to target nodes based on
currently running Torque/PBS jobs. Similar to the slurm
module, the torque module is typically called after all
other node <br>
selection options have been processed, and if no nodes have
been selected, the module will attempt to read a running
jobid from the PBS_JOBID environment variable (which is set
<br>
when running under a Torque allocation).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-j jobid[,jobid,...] <br>
Target list of nodes allocated to the Torque job jobid. This
option may be used multiple times to target multiple Torque
jobs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rms module options <br>
The rms module allows pdsh to target nodes based on an RMS
resource. The rms module is typically called after all other
node selection options, and if no nodes have been <br>
selected, the module will examine the RMS_RESOURCEID
environment variable and attempt to set the target list of
hosts to the nodes in the RMS resource. If an invalid
resource is <br>
denoted, the variable is silently ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SDR module options <br>
The SDR module supports targeting hosts via the System Data
Repository on IBM SPs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a Target all nodes in the SDR.
The list is generated from the &quot;reliable hostname&quot;
in the SDR by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i Translate hostnames between
reliable and initial in the SDR, when applicable. If the a
target hostname matches either the initial or reliable
hostname in the SDR, the <br>
alternate name will be substitued. Thus a list composed of
initial hostnames will instead be replaced with a list of
reliable hostnames. For example, when used with -a <br>
above, all initial hostnames in the SDR are targeted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Do not target nodes that are
marked as not responding in the SDR on the targeted
interface. (If a hostname does not appear in the SDR, then
that name will remain in the <br>
target hostlist.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-G In combination with -a,
include all partitions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nodeattr module options <br>
The nodeattr module supports access to the genders database
via the nodeattr(1) command. See the genders section above
for a list of support options with this module. The option
<br>
usage with the nodeattr module is the same as genders,
above, with the exception that the -i option may only be
used with -a or -g. NOTE: This module will only work with
very old <br>
releases of genders where the nodeattr(1) command supports
the -r option, and before the libgenders API was available.
Users running newer versions of genders will need to use
<br>
the genders module instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dshgroup module options <br>
The dshgroup module allows pdsh to use dsh (or
Dancer&rsquo;s shell) style group files from /etc/dsh/group/
or ~/.dsh/group/. The default search path may be overridden
with the DSH&acirc; <br>
GROUP_PATH environment variable, a colon-separated list of
directories to search. The default value for DSHGROUP_PATH
is /etc/dsh/group.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g groupname,... <br>
Target nodes in dsh group file &quot;groupname&quot; found
in either ~/.dsh/group/groupname or
/etc/dsh/group/groupname.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X groupname,... <br>
Exclude nodes in dsh group file &quot;groupname.&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As an enhancement in pdsh,
dshgroup files may optionally include other dshgroup files
via a special #include STRING syntax. The argument to
#include may be either a file path, <br>
or a group name, in which case the path used to search for
the group file is the same as if the group had been
specified to -g.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">netgroup module options <br>
The netgroup module allows pdsh to use standard netgroup
entries to build lists of target hosts. (/etc/netgroup or
NIS)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g groupname,... <br>
Target nodes in netgroup &quot;groupname.&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X groupname,... <br>
Exclude nodes in netgroup &quot;groupname.&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
PDSH_RCMD_TYPE <br>
Equivalent to the -R option, the value of this environment
variable will be used to set the default rcmd module for
pdsh to use (e.g. ssh, rsh).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PDSH_SSH_ARGS <br>
Override the standard arguments that pdsh passes to the
ssh(1) command (&quot;-2 -a -x -l%u %h&quot;). The use of
the parameters %u, %h, and %n (as documented in the
rcmd/exec sec&acirc; <br>
tion above) is optional. If these parameters are missing,
pdsh will append them to the ssh commandline because it is
assumed they are mandatory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PDSH_SSH_ARGS_APPEND <br>
Append additional options to the ssh(1) command invoked by
pdsh. For example, PDSH_SSH_ARGS_APPEND=&quot;-q&quot; would
run ssh in quiet mode, or &quot;-v&quot; would increase the
verbosity <br>
of ssh. (Note: these arguments are actually prepended to the
ssh commandline to ensure they appear before any target
hostname argument to ssh.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WCOLL If no other node selection
option is used, the WCOLL environment variable may be set to
a filename from which a list of target hosts will be read.
The file should contain <br>
a list of hosts, one per line (though each line may contain
a hostlist expression. See HOSTLIST EXPRESSIONS section
below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DSHPATH <br>
If set, the path in DSHPATH will be used as the PATH for the
remote processes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FANOUT Set the pdsh fanout (See
description of -f above).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOSTLIST EXPRESSIONS <br>
As noted in sections above pdsh accepts lists of hosts the
general form: prefix[n-m,l-k,...], where n &lt; m and l &lt;
k, etc., as an alternative to explicit lists of hosts. This
form <br>
should not be confused with regular expression character
classes (also denoted by &lsquo;&lsquo;[]&rsquo;&rsquo;).
For example, foo[19] does not represent an expression
matching foo1 or foo9, but rather <br>
represents the degenerate hostlist: foo19.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The hostlist syntax is meant
only as a convenience on clusters with a
&quot;prefixNNN&quot; naming convention and specification of
ranges should not be considered necessary -- this <br>
foo1,foo9 could be specified as such, or by the hostlist
foo[1,9].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some examples of usage
follow:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Run command on
foo01,foo02,...,foo05 <br>
pdsh -w foo[01-05] command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Run command on foo7,foo9,foo10
<br>
pdsh -w foo[7,9-10] command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Run command on foo0,foo4,foo5
<br>
pdsh -w foo[0-5] -x foo[1-3] command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A suffix on the hostname is also
supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Run command on
foo0-eth0,foo1-eth0,foo2-eth0,foo3-eth0 <br>
pdsh -w foo[0-3]-eth0 command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As a reminder to the reader,
some shells will interpret brackets (&rsquo;[&rsquo; and
&rsquo;]&rsquo;) for pattern matching. Depending on your
shell, it may be necessary to enclose ranged lists within
<br>
quotes. For example, in tcsh, the first example above should
be executed as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pdsh -w &quot;foo[01-05]&quot;
command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ORIGIN <br>
Originally a rewrite of IBM dsh(1) by Jim Garlick
&lt;garlick@llnl.gov&gt; on LLNL&rsquo;s ASCI Blue-Pacific
IBM SP system. It is now used on Linux clusters at LLNL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LIMITATIONS <br>
When using ssh for remote execution, expect the stderr of
ssh to be folded in with that of the remote command. When
invoked by pdsh, it is not possible for ssh to prompt for
<br>
passwords if RSA/DSA keys are configured properly, etc.. For
ssh implementations that suppport a connect timeout option,
pdsh attempts to use that option to enforce the timeout <br>
(e.g. -oConnectTimeout=T for OpenSSH), otherwise connect
timeouts are not supported when using ssh. Finally, there is
no reliable way for pdsh to ensure that remote commands are
<br>
actually terminated when using a command timeout. Thus if -u
is used with ssh commands may be left running on remote
hosts even after timeout has killed local ssh processes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Output from multiple processes
per node may be interspersed when using qshell or mqshell
rcmd modules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The number of nodes that pdsh
can simultaneously execute remote jobs on is limited by the
maximum number of threads that can be created concurrently,
as well as the availability <br>
of reserved ports in the rsh and qshell rcmd modules. On
systems that implement Posix threads, the limit is typically
defined by the constant PTHREADS_THREADS_MAX.</p>
