<p>OCAML(1) General Commands Manual OCAML(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ocaml - The OCaml interactive toplevel</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ocaml [ options ] [ object-files ] [ script-file ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The ocaml(1) command is the toplevel system for OCaml, that
permits interactive use of the OCaml system through a
read-eval-print loop. In this mode, the system repeatedly
reads <br>
OCaml phrases from the input, then typechecks, compiles and
evaluates them, then prints the inferred type and result
value, if any. The system prints a # (sharp) prompt before
<br>
reading each phrase.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A toplevel phrase can span
several lines. It is terminated by ;; (a double-semicolon).
The syntax of toplevel phrases is as follows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The toplevel system is started
by the command ocaml(1). Phrases are read on standard input,
results are printed on standard output, errors on standard
error. End-of-file on <br>
standard input terminates ocaml(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If one or more object-files
(ending in .cmo or .cma) are given, they are loaded silently
before starting the toplevel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a script-file is given,
phrases are read silently from the file, errors printed on
standard error. ocaml(1) exits after the execution of the
last phrase.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The following command-line options are recognized by
ocaml(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-absname <br>
Show absolute filenames in error messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I directory <br>
Add the given directory to the list of directories searched
for source and compiled files. By default, the current
directory is searched first, then the standard library <br>
directory. Directories added with -I are searched after the
current directory, in the order in which they were given on
the command line, but before the standard library <br>
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the given directory starts
with +, it is taken relative to the standard library
directory. For instance, -I +labltk adds the subdirectory
labltk of the standard library <br>
to the search path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Directories can also be added to
the search path once the toplevel is running with the
#directory directive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-init file <br>
Load the given file instead of the default initialization
file. The default file is .ocamlinit in the current
directory if it exists, otherwise .ocamlinit in the
user&rsquo;s <br>
home directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-labels <br>
Labels are not ignored in types, labels may be used in
applications, and labelled parameters can be given in any
order. This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-no-app-funct <br>
Deactivates the applicative behaviour of functors. With this
option, each functor application generates new types in its
result and applying the same functor twice to the <br>
same argument yields two incompatible structures.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-noassert <br>
Do not compile assertion checks. Note that the special form
assert false is always compiled because it is typed
specially.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nolabels <br>
Ignore non-optional labels in types. Labels cannot be used
in applications, and parameter order becomes strict.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-noprompt <br>
Do not display any prompt when waiting for input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nopromptcont <br>
Do not display the secondary prompt when waiting for
continuation lines in multi-line inputs. This should be used
e.g. when running ocaml(1) in an emacs(1) window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nostdlib <br>
Do not include the standard library directory in the list of
directories searched for source and compiled files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ppx command <br>
After parsing, pipe the abstract syntax tree through the
preprocessor command. The format of the input and ouput of
the preprocessor are not yet documented.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-principal <br>
Check information path during type-checking, to make sure
that all types are derived in a principal way. When using
labelled arguments and/or polymorphic methods, this <br>
flag is required to ensure future versions of the compiler
will be able to infer types correctly, even if internal
algorithms change. All programs accepted in -principal <br>
mode are also accepted in the default mode with equivalent
types, but different binary signatures, and this may slow
down type checking; yet it is a good idea to use it <br>
once before publishing source code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-rectypes <br>
Allow arbitrary recursive types during type-checking. By
default, only recursive types where the recursion goes
through an object type are supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-short-paths <br>
When a type is visible under several module-paths, use the
shortest one when printing the type&rsquo;s name in inferred
interfaces and error and warning messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-stdin Read the standard input
as a script file rather than starting an interactive
session.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-strict-sequence <br>
Force the left-hand part of each sequence to have type
unit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-unsafe <br>
Turn bound checking off on array and string accesses (the
v.(i)ands.[i] constructs). Programs compiled with -unsafe
are therefore slightly faster, but unsafe: anything can <br>
happen if the program accesses an array or string outside of
its bounds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-version <br>
Print version string and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-vnum Print short version number
and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w warning-list <br>
Enable or disable warnings according to the argument
warning-list. See ocamlc(1) for the syntax of the
warning-list argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-warn-error warning-list <br>
Mark as fatal the warnings described by the argument
warning-list. Note that a warning is not triggered (and does
not trigger an error) if it is disabled by the -w <br>
option. See ocamlc(1) for the syntax of the warning-list
argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-warn-help <br>
Show the description of all available warning numbers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- file Use file as a script file
name, even when it starts with a hyphen (-).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-help or --help <br>
Display a short usage summary and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
LC_CTYPE <br>
If set to iso_8859_1, accented characters (from the ISO
Latin-1 character set) in string and character literals are
printed as is; otherwise, they are printed as decimal <br>
escape sequences.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TERM When printing error
messages, the toplevel system attempts to underline visually
the location of the error. It consults the TERM variable to
determines the type of output <br>
terminal and look up its capabilities in the terminal
database.</p>
