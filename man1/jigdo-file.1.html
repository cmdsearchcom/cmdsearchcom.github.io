<p>JIGDO-FILE(1) JIGDO-FILE(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
jigdo-file - Prepare files for Jigsaw Download (distribution
of huge files, e.g. CD images).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
jigdo-file COMMAND <br>
[ --image=cdrom.iso ] [ --jigdo=cdrom.jigdo ] [
--template=cdrom.template ] [ --force ] [ MORE OPTIONS ] [
FILES ... | --files-from=f ] <br>
Common COMMANDs: make-template, make-image, verify</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Jigsaw Download, or short jigdo, is a scheme developed
primarily to make it easy to distribute huge filesystem
images (e.g. CD (ISO9660) or DVD (UDF) images) over the
internet, <br>
but it could also be used for other data which is awkward to
handle due to its size, like audio/video files or large
software packages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">jigdo tries to ensure that the
large file (always called image from now on) is downloaded
in small parts which can be stored on different servers.
People who want to download the <br>
image do so by telling the jigdo(1) (NOT IMPLEMENTED YET)
download tool to process one &lsquo;.jigdo&rsquo; file;
using it, jigdo downloads the parts and reassembles the
image. jigdo-file is <br>
used to prepare the files for download.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">What makes jigdo special is that
the parts that are used to reconstruct the image can have
any size and content - they only need to be contained in a
contiguous region anywhere <br>
in the image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, if you wish to
distribute an ISO9660 image which contains a snapshot of an
FTP server, you can instruct jigdo-file to prepare the
download data in such a way that <br>
when people use jigdo to download the image, jigdo actually
fetches the individual files from the FTP server and
assembles them into an exact copy of your image - during the
<br>
download! (If the image is not a filesystem dump, you can
use split(1) to create the small parts that the image will
be reassembled from.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You are completely free to
choose where the individual parts of the image are stored:
They may be in entirely different directories on different
servers (e.g. because of stor&acirc; <br>
age/bandwidth constraints), but this is invisible to the
people downloading your image. The information about
available servers only needs to be added to the
&lsquo;.jigdo&rsquo; file by you <br>
before distributing it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &lsquo;DETAILS&rsquo;
section below contains technical details on how jigdo works.
The &lsquo;EXAMPLES&rsquo; section lists a number of common
scenarios and may help you to get an idea of what jigdo <br>
is useful for.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Many options are specific to a particular COMMAND; the ones
below are general or used by several commands. Further
options are listed below with the individual commands. All
<br>
options are silently ignored if they are not applicable to
the current command. For any BYTES parameters to options,
you can append one of the letters &lsquo;k&rsquo;,
&lsquo;M&rsquo; or &lsquo;G&rsquo; to the <br>
amount you specify, to indicate kilobytes, megabytes or
gigabytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h --help <br>
Output short summary of commands and options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H --help-all <br>
Output complete summary of commands and options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v --version <br>
Output program version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i --image=cdrom.iso <br>
Specify location of the file containing the image. The image
is the large file that you want to distribute.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-j --jigdo=cdrom.jigdo <br>
Specify location of the Jigsaw Download description file.
The jigdo file is a human-readable file generated by
jigdo-file, to which you add information about all the <br>
servers you are going to upload the files to. jigdo will
download this file as the first step of retrieving the
image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t --template=cdrom.template
<br>
Specify location of the image &lsquo;template&rsquo; file.
The template file is a binary file generated by jigdo-file,
it contains information on how to reassemble the image and
also <br>
(in compressed form) all the data from the image which was
not found in any of the parts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Depending on the command, each
of these three files is used sometimes for input, sometimes
for output. If the file is to be used for output for a
particular command and <br>
the output file already exists, jigdo-file exits with an
error, unless --force is present.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In most cases, you will only
need to specify one out of -i -j -t, because any missing
filenames will be deduced from the one you specify. This is
done by first stripping <br>
any extension from the supplied name and then appending
nothing (if deducing --image), &lsquo;.jigdo&rsquo; or
&lsquo;.template&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r
--report=default|noprogress|quiet|grep <br>
Control how verbose the program is, and what format the
output has: noprogress is the same as default except that no
&lsquo;x% done&rsquo; progress messages are printed. quiet
<br>
restricts the output to what is absolutely necessary, mostly
error messages. grep is only different from default for the
make-template command: It enables output in a <br>
simple &lsquo;&lt;offset&gt; &lt;file&gt;&rsquo; format
which is useful when searching for binary files in other
binary files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f --force <br>
Overwrite existent output files without complaining.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-force <br>
This is the default. Refuse to overwrite existent output
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c --cache=jigdo-cache.db <br>
jigdo-file usually needs to read the entire contents of all
the FILES you specify. If you use it repeatedly (e.g.
because you make a new CD image available daily), caching
<br>
the file information will increase the program&rsquo;s speed
significantly. The cache file is automatically created if it
is not yet present. Data is usually both read from and <br>
written to it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-cache <br>
This is the default. Do not use a cache.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--cache-expiry=SECONDS <br>
Set maximum age of cache entries. Any entries older than
this will be removed from the cache. The default is 30 days.
You can append one of the letters &lsquo;h&rsquo;,
&lsquo;d&rsquo;, &lsquo;w&rsquo;, &lsquo;m&rsquo;, <br>
&lsquo;y&rsquo; to denote hours, days, weeks, months or
years, respectively. A value of &lsquo;0&rsquo; or
&lsquo;off&rsquo; disables expiry, so that all entries will
stay in the cache forever. See the sec&acirc; <br>
tion &lsquo;CACHE FILES&rsquo; below for more
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--readbuffer=BYTES <br>
Set size of internal buffers. The default is 128k - if you
have a fast disc, increasing this value may make jigdo-file
faster, but in general, changing it is not neces&acirc; <br>
sary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--md5-block-size=BYTES <br>
Uninteresting internal parameter. Set size of blocks into
which files are subdivided. The default is 128k. If you
change it, any cache file will have to be regenerated. <br>
Internally, jigdo-file may choose to use a slightly larger
or smaller value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T --files-from=file <br>
Read file and directory names from the specified file. If
file is &lsquo;-&rsquo;, read names from standard input.
Each line in the file is taken as a name, so the names may
contain <br>
spaces, but not newline characters. An empty line causes
jigdo-file to stop reading from the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">find(1) is a powerful tool for
generating file lists, but make sure to use &lsquo;find
-type f&rsquo; if possible - otherwise, if you instruct find
to output both a filename and a <br>
symlink to that filename, jigdo-file will read the file
contents twice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--hex Output checksums in
hexadecimal instead of Base64-like format. This should not
be used with the make-template command, because the
resulting &lsquo;.jigdo&rsquo; file violates the <br>
&lsquo;.jigdo&rsquo; file format. Its intended use is to
make jigdo-file more interoperable with other Unix shell
utilities like md5sum(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-hex <br>
This is the default. Use jigdo&rsquo;s own Base64-like
encoding of checksums.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--debug[=help|=all|=UNIT,~UNIT...
] <br>
Switch on or off debugging output. Just
&lsquo;--debug&rsquo; is equivalent to
&lsquo;--debug=all&rsquo;. The argument is a comma-separated
list of unit names for which debugging output is to be <br>
enabled, or disabled if the name is preceded by
&lsquo;~&rsquo;. The special name &lsquo;all&rsquo; means
all units. By default, debugging output is switched off
except for the units &lsquo;assert&rsquo; and <br>
&lsquo;general&rsquo;. The exact list of available units for
which debugging can be switched on depends on whether jigdo
was compiled with debugging support - the list can be
printed <br>
with &lsquo;--debug=help&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES Names of files or
directories to use as input. These are the parts that are
contained in the image. In case one of the names is a
directory, the program recursively scans <br>
the directory and adds all files contained in it. While
doing this, it follows symbolic links, but avoids symlink
loops.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If one of the filenames starts
with the character &lsquo;-&rsquo;, you must precede the
list of files with &lsquo;--&rsquo;. A value of
&lsquo;-&rsquo; has no special meaning in this list, it
stands for a <br>
file whose name is a single hyphen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMANDS <br>
The command name is the first non-option argument passed to
jigdo-file. Most commands have short abbreviations as well
as long names. The short command names should not be used
<br>
in scripts - there may be incompatible changes to them in
the future!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MAKE-TEMPLATE, MT <br>
Reads image and FILES, creates &lsquo;.jigdo&rsquo; and
&lsquo;.template&rsquo;. This is the main functionality of
jigdo-file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is possible to specify both
--image=- and --files-from=-. In this case, first the list
of files is read from standard input until an empty line is
encountered. Everything fol&acirc; <br>
lowing it is assumed to be the image data. This can be
useful if you use mkisofs(1) or similar programs that can
output the complete image on their standard output, because
there <br>
is no need to store the image on disc temporarily.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a FILES argument contains the
characters &lsquo;//&rsquo; (Unix) or &lsquo;.&acute;
(Windows), this has special meaning. In the final jigdo file
that users will download, each of the parts is ref&acirc;
<br>
erenced in the &lsquo;[Parts]&rsquo; section with a URI of
the form &lsquo;Label:some/filename&rsquo;. (See
&lsquo;FORMAT OF .JIGDO FILES&rsquo; below for a detailed
description.) The &lsquo;[Servers]&rsquo; section gives a
<br>
mapping of labels to servers on the internet, with lines
like &lsquo;Label=http://myserver.org/jigdofiles/&rsquo;.
Using this information, jigdo will create the final download
URI for the <br>
part,
&lsquo;http://myserver.org/jigdofiles/some/filename&rsquo;.
Specifying &lsquo;//&rsquo; (or &lsquo;.&acute;) in a file
or directory name serves to &lsquo;cut off&rsquo; the names
at the right directory level. For <br>
example, if the Unix path of one of your FILES is
&lsquo;/path/some/filename&rsquo;, you can tell jigdo-file
to cut off after the &lsquo;/path&rsquo; by passing it the
argument &lsquo;/path//some/filename&rsquo;, <br>
or &lsquo;/path//&rsquo; if you want the whole directory
scanned. The path names need not be absolute;
&lsquo;somedirectory//&rsquo; is also possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--label Label=/path <br>
Specify a name to use as the label name for a path on disc.
(Influences the output jigdo file.) If you used
&lsquo;//&rsquo; in the FILES arguments as described above,
jigdo-file will <br>
by default pick label names automatically (&lsquo;A&rsquo;,
&lsquo;B&rsquo; etc.). With this option, you can give labels
more meaningful names. Note that the label name will only be
used if one <br>
or more FILES begin with &lsquo;/path//&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Try to use label names that
start with uppercase characters, to disambiguate them
clearly from protocol names like &lsquo;http&rsquo;,
&lsquo;ftp&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--uri
Label=http://some.server.org/ <br>
By default, using --label as described above will cause
lines of the form &lsquo;Label=file:/path/&rsquo; to be
written to the &lsquo;[Servers]&rsquo; section of the output
jigdo file. If you <br>
want to override the &lsquo;file:&rsquo; URI so that the
line reads &lsquo;Label=http://some.server.org/&rsquo;, you
can do so by specifying --uri along with --label. Giving
just --uri Label=... <br>
without the corresponding --label Label=... has no effect,
and even if you specify both, an entry is only added to the
&lsquo;[Servers]&rsquo; section if the label is referenced
by at <br>
least one &lsquo;[Parts]&rsquo; entry.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The supplied value is not quoted
by the program; if it contains characters such as space or
any of the characters #&quot;&rsquo;&nbsp;then you must
quote it. (Under Unix, you may need <br>
to quote the value twice to also protect it from the shell,
e.g. \\ or &rsquo;\&rsquo; to get a single backslash in the
URI.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The mapping specified with an
--uri option is ignored if it is already present in the
output jigdo file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Users of the Windows version may
notice that the &lsquo;&acute; directory separators are
converted into &lsquo;/&rsquo; in the &lsquo;file:&rsquo;
URIs that are generated by default. This is done to <br>
increase cross-platform compatibility of &lsquo;file:&rsquo;
- the print-missing command of the Windows version will
automatically re-convert the characters when it prints the
URIs. <br>
In case you supply your own &lsquo;file:&rsquo; URIs under
Windows using --uri, you must also exchange &lsquo;/&rsquo;
and &lsquo;&acute;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-0 to -9 <br>
Set amount of compression in the output template file, from
-0 (no compression) to -9 (maximum compression). The default
is -9, which can make the template generation <br>
quite slow. By default, the compression algorithm used is
the same as for gzip(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--gzip and --bzip2 <br>
Choose between the gzip and bzip2 compression algorithms.
The default is gzip. Bzip2 usually gives a better
compression ratio, but compression is significantly slower
than <br>
with gzip.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--min-length=BYTES <br>
Set minimum length of a part for jigdo-file to look for it
in the image. The default is 1k. Parts smaller than this
will never be found in the image, so their data will <br>
be included in the template file. The search algorithm used
requires such a minimum length, otherwise template
generation could become extremely slow. If you know for sure
<br>
that all your FILES are larger than a certain amount, you
can increase jigdo-file&rsquo;s speed slightly by specifying
the amount with this option. There is a hard-wired
abso&acirc; <br>
lute minimum of 256 bytes - anything lower will silently be
set to 256.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--merge=FILE <br>
Include the contents of FILE in the output
&lsquo;.jigdo&rsquo; file. The file can contain data which
you want added to the output (for example, a
&lsquo;[Servers]&rsquo; section with a list of <br>
your servers as entries), or it can be the jigdo file output
by an earlier run of jigdo-file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is possible to specify the
same file for input with --merge and for output with
--jigdo. However, you will also need to use --force to make
the program overwrite the <br>
old version of the jigdo file with the new one. FILE can be
&lsquo;-&rsquo; for standard input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When adding new information to
the supplied file, jigdo-file will not insert new lines into
the &lsquo;[Parts]&rsquo; section if an entry for the same
MD5 checksum (but not necessar&acirc; <br>
ily with the same URI!) already exists, and it will not
insert new lines into the &lsquo;[Servers]&rsquo; section if
a completely identical entry already exists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When reading in the existing
FILE, the behaviour is slightly different: The program
preserves entries in the &lsquo;[Parts]&rsquo; section with
identical checksum, but different URIs. <br>
For completely identical entries (same checksum and URI),
only one entry is preserved and the duplicates are removed.
The &lsquo;[Servers]&rsquo; section is left untouched.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--image-section <br>
This is the default. Causes jigdo-file to add an
&lsquo;[Image]&rsquo; section to the &lsquo;.jigdo&rsquo;
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As an exception, a new
&lsquo;[Image]&rsquo; section is not added if you use
--merge and the file to merge contains an
&lsquo;[Image]&rsquo; section with a line which reads
&lsquo;Template-MD5Sum=&rsquo; <br>
(end of line after the &lsquo;=&rsquo;). In this case, the
generated template data&rsquo;s MD5 checksum value is just
added after the &lsquo;=&rsquo; of the first line of this
form in the file - no <br>
whole new &lsquo;[Image]&rsquo; section is appended. This
behaviour is useful because it allows you to pass via
--merge an &lsquo;[Image]&rsquo; section with arbitrary
content and then have the <br>
MD5 checksum automatically added by jigdo-file. The section
&lsquo;FORMAT OF .JIGDO FILES&rsquo; below explains the
&lsquo;[Image]&rsquo; section contents in greater
detail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-image-section <br>
Do not include an &lsquo;[Image]&rsquo; section in the
&lsquo;.jigdo&rsquo; file. You need to add one yourself if
you use this option. However, doing that is not easy (you
also need to add a <br>
&lsquo;Template-MD5Sum&rsquo; line with the correct
checksum, or jigdo will complain), so use of this option is
discouraged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--servers-section <br>
This is the default. Causes jigdo-file to add a
&lsquo;[Servers]&rsquo; section to the &lsquo;.jigdo&rsquo;
file. This default section uses &lsquo;file:&rsquo; URIs,
which allows for immediate reassembly of <br>
the image from the local filesystem, and is also useful if
you want to edit the file manually and replace the
&lsquo;file:&rsquo; URIs with other URIs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-servers-section <br>
Do not add a &lsquo;[Servers]&rsquo; section at the end of
the &lsquo;.jigdo&rsquo; file. Useful e.g. if you are going
to append the section with a script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--match-exec=SHELLCOMMAND <br>
Whenever a file is found in the image, execute the supplied
command string by passing it to a shell. jigdo-file sets up
a number of environment variables with information <br>
about the file match. For example, if the file
&lsquo;/path//a/b/file&rsquo; was found in the image and
&lsquo;Label:a/b/file&rsquo; is going to be written to the
&lsquo;.jigdo&rsquo; file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
LABEL=&quot;Label&quot; - Name of the label for the file.
The example assumes that &lsquo;--label Label=/path&rsquo;
was specified by you. In the absence of such an option,
LABEL will be set <br>
but empty.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
LABELPATH=&quot;/path/&quot; - The path corresponding to the
label, or in other words, the prefix of the matched
file&rsquo;s path that will not appear in the output
&lsquo;.jigdo&rsquo; file. Is <br>
set even without any &lsquo;--label&rsquo; option present.
Ends with a slash.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
MATCHPATH=&quot;a/b/&quot; - The rest of the path, without
the leafname of the matched file. Is either empty or ends
with a slash.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
LEAF=&quot;file&quot; - The leafname of the matched
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
MD5SUM=&quot;lNVdUSqbo2yqm33webrhnw&quot; - The md5sum of
the matched file, in Base64-like format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
FILE=&quot;/path//a/b/file&quot; - For convenience, the
complete path of the file. The variable is always set to
$LABELPATH$MATCHPATH$LEAF.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please be careful to correctly
quote the string passed to this option, otherwise your
supplied command will not work with filenames that contain
spaces. As an example, to create <br>
a backup of hard links to the matched files, use the
following option: --match-exec=&rsquo;mkdir -p
&quot;${LABEL:-.}/$MATCHPATH&quot; &amp;&amp; ln -f
&quot;$FILE&quot;
&quot;${LABEL:-.}/$MATCHPATH$LEAF&quot;&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, no command is
executed. Use --match-exec=&quot;&quot; to remove a command
string which was set with an earlier use of this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--greedy-matching <br>
This is the default. Imagine that your image contains a .tar
file which in turn contains another file x, and that you
provide both the .tar and the files inside it on the <br>
command line. When jigdo-file scans the image, it encounters
the beginning of the .tar file, and then the file x.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At this point, a decision must
be made: Should the smaller file x be recorded as matched,
or should it be ignored in favour of the larger (and thus
better) match of the <br>
.tar file? Unfortunately, at this point it is not clear
whether there will actually be a full match of the .tar, so
by default, the program prefers the small match.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-greedy-matching <br>
In the case where a large partial match is present and a
shorter match has been confirmed, ignore the small match.
(See the option above.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MAKE-IMAGE, MI <br>
Reads &lsquo;.template&rsquo; and FILES, creates image (or
&lsquo;imagename.tmp&rsquo;). Provides a rudimentary way of
reassembling images - jigdo is usually better suited for
this task. However, in <br>
contrast to jigdo, no &lsquo;.jigdo&rsquo; file is
required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the image is to be written to
a file (and not to standard output), it is possible to
create the image in several steps, with several invocations
of &lsquo;jigdo-file make-image&rsquo;, as <br>
follows: You first invoke jigdo-file, specifying as many
files as are available at this time. The program scans the
files, and those that are contained in the image are copied
to <br>
a temporary file, whose name is formed by appending
&lsquo;.tmp&rsquo; to the image filename.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For all further files which
could be parts of the image, you repeat this process. As
soon as all parts are present, the temporary file will be
truncated slightly (to delete some <br>
administrative data that jigdo-file appends at the end) and
renamed to the final image name. The possibility of
reassembling the image in several steps is especially useful
for <br>
gathering files from removable media, e.g. several older
CDs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Scripts using make-image can
detect whether image creation is complete by checking the
exit status: 0 signals successful creation, whereas 1 means
that more files need to be sup&acirc; <br>
plied. Other errors result in an exit status of 2
(&lsquo;recoverable&rsquo;, e.g. file not found) or 3
(non-recoverable, e.g. write error).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--check-files <br>
This is the default. Whenever any part is copied to the
image, re-check its checksum against the checksum stored in
the template. It is recommended that you leave this <br>
switched on, even if it slows down image creation a bit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-check-files <br>
Do not check files&rsquo; checksums when copying them to the
image. This can be safely used when no cache file is used
(which means that files will be written to the image
imme&acirc; <br>
diately after being scanned) or the whole image is checked
later with the verify command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PRINT-MISSING, PM <br>
Reads &lsquo;.jigdo&rsquo;, &lsquo;.template&rsquo; and (if
present) &lsquo;imagename.tmp&rsquo;, outputs a list of URIs
still needed to completely reassemble the image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Together with the make-image
command, this provides most of the functionality of jigdo on
the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For each part that is not yet
present in the temporary image file, the file checksum is
looked up in the &lsquo;[Parts]&rsquo; section of the jigdo
file. Any label in the corresponding entry <br>
is then expanded according to the label definitions in the
&lsquo;[Servers]&rsquo; section and printed on standard
output. jigdo allows you to specify several alternative
locations for each <br>
label in this section, but print-missing will only output
the first one for each missing part.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the checksum cannot be found
in the &lsquo;[Parts]&rsquo; section (this Should Not Happen
unless you deleted that section), a lookup is instead made
for &lsquo;MD5Sum:&lt;checksum&gt;&rsquo;, just like <br>
with jigdo. (Thus, if you want to get rid of the
&lsquo;[Parts]&rsquo; section, you can do so if you rename
each part to its own checksum.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--uri
Label=http://some.server.org/ <br>
Override the entries in the &lsquo;.jigdo&rsquo; file for
any label with a URI of your choice. With the example above,
a &lsquo;[Parts]&rsquo; entry of
&lsquo;Label:some/filename&rsquo; will cause the line <br>
&lsquo;http://some.server.org/some/filename&rsquo; to be
printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The supplied value is not quoted
by the program; if it contains characters such as space or
any of the characters #&quot;&rsquo;&nbsp;then you must
quote it. (Under Unix, you may need <br>
to quote the value twice to also protect it from the shell,
e.g. \\ or &rsquo;\&rsquo; to get a single backslash in the
URI.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PRINT-MISSING-ALL, PMA <br>
Just like print-missing, this command outputs a list of URIs
still needed to completely reassemble the image. However,
all alternative download locations are printed instead of
<br>
just one. In the output, the URIs for a file are separated
from other files&rsquo; URIs with blank lines. The --uri
option has the same effect as for print-missing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VERIFY, VER <br>
Reads image (presumably generated with make-image) and
&lsquo;.template&rsquo;, checks for correct checksum of
image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The template data does not only
contain checksums of the individual parts, but also of the
image as a whole. make-image already performs a number of
internal checks, but if you <br>
like, you can additionally check the image with this
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SCAN, SC <br>
Reads all the FILES and enters them into the cache, unless
they are already cached. The --cache option must be present
for this command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-scan-whole-file <br>
This is the default. This only causes the first
--md5-block-size bytes of each file to be read. If the cache
is used later by jigdo-file make-image, the rest of the file
<br>
will be read once these first bytes are recognized in the
input image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--scan-whole-file <br>
Immediately read the entire file contents and store them in
the cache.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MD5SUM, MD5 <br>
Reads all the FILES and prints out MD5 checksums of their
contents. This command is quite similar to md5sum(1), except
that the checksum is output in the Base64-like encoding <br>
which is also used elsewhere by jigdo-file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The FILES arguments are
processed in the same way as with the other commands, which
means that recursion automatically takes place for any
arguments that are directories, and <br>
that symbolic links are not listed except when the file(s)
they point to are not reachable directly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the checksum list printed on
standard output, only the part of the filename following any
&lsquo;//&rsquo; (or &lsquo;.&acute; on Windows) is printed.
Any --cache will be used for querying files&rsquo; <br>
MD5 checksums and/or writing the checksums of scanned
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LIST-TEMPLATE, LS <br>
Reads a &lsquo;.template&rsquo; file and outputs low-level
information about the image and all parts contained in it,
including offset, length and checksum.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also use this command
with temporary image files (by specifying something like
--template=imagename.tmp) - in that case, the output also
distinguishes between parts that <br>
have been written to the image and parts that
haven&rsquo;t.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The exact output format may
change incompatibly between different jigdo releases. The
following different types of lines can be output.
&lsquo;have-file&rsquo; only occurs for &lsquo;.tmp&rsquo;
files, <br>
indicating a file that has already been successfully written
to the temporary file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">in-template offset-in-image
length <br>
need-file offset-in-image length file-md5sum
filestart-rsyncsum <br>
have-file offset-in-image length file-md5sum
filestart-rsyncsum <br>
image-info image-length image-md5sum rsyncsum-size</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DETAILS <br>
Jigsaw Download was created with the format of ISO9660 CD
images in mind - however, the following also applies to many
other filesystem formats, as well as to &lsquo;tar&rsquo;
archives and <br>
uncompressed &lsquo;zip&rsquo; archives. A CD image contains
both information for organizing the filesystem (header with
disc name etc., ISO9660 directory data, data of extensions
such as <br>
Joliet or RockRidge, zero padding) and the files contained
on the CD. An important property that jigdo relies on is
that each file is stored in one contiguous section of the
<br>
image; it is not split into two or more parts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When jigdo-file is given a
number of files that might be contained in an image, it
detects whether any of the files are present using a
&lsquo;rolling checksum&rsquo; inspired by the one <br>
used by rsync(1). The resulting data is written to the
&lsquo;.template&rsquo; file: If a section of the image
could not be matched (e.g. it was directory information),
the data is com&acirc; <br>
pressed and written directly to the template. However, if a
matching file was found, its data is omitted from the
template. Instead, only a reference (an MD5 checksum of the
<br>
file) is inserted in the template.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the template data only
contains binary data, it does not contain any filenames or
URIs, since it cannot be easily edited in case any of these
values need to be changed. <br>
All that information is stored in the &lsquo;.jigdo&rsquo;
file, a text file to which you can add URLs for your
server(s). The jigdo file provides a mapping for each MD5
checksum to one or <br>
more alternative download locations for the corresponding
part.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Apart from the mapping of MD5
sums to URIs, the jigdo file also contains an URI pointing
to a download location for the template file. This way, the
jigdo download tool only <br>
needs to be given one URI (that of the &lsquo;.jigdo&rsquo;
file) to be able to download and reassemble the complete
image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FORMAT OF .JIGDO FILES <br>
The overall format of &lsquo;.jigdo&rsquo; files follows
that of &lsquo;.ini&rsquo; files, as also used by the Gnome
and KDE projects for some data. The file is organized into
sections, each of which is <br>
preceded by a line reading &lsquo;[Sectionname]&rsquo;.
Within each section, lines have the form
&lsquo;Label=Value&rsquo;. Such lines are also called
&lsquo;entries&rsquo; below. All &lsquo;.jigdo&rsquo; files
use UTF-8 as <br>
their character encoding.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Comments are introduced with the
&lsquo;#&rsquo; character and extend to the end of the line.
Whitespace is ignored at line start and end as well as to
the left and right of section names <br>
and the &lsquo;=&rsquo; in entries. Furthermore, the jigdo
utilities split up the text of the entry value (i.e. the
part after the &lsquo;=&rsquo;) into whitespace-separated
words, much like the Unix <br>
shell. Single &rsquo;&rsquo; and double &quot;&quot; quotes
can be used to prevent that e.g. URIs containing whitespace
are split apart. Similarly, characters with special meaning
(the characters &rsquo;&quot;# and space/tab) must be quoted
with &nbsp;to appear in the value. As with the shell, there
is a difference between &rsquo; &rsquo; and &quot; &quot;:
Within &rsquo; &rsquo;, the characters &quot;#&nbsp;and
whitespace lose <br>
their special meaning and become ordinary characters,
whereas within &quot; &quot;, only the characters &rsquo;#
and whitespace lose their special meaning - in other words,
backslash escapes <br>
still work inside &quot; &quot;, but not &rsquo;
&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;.jigdo&rsquo; files can
optionally be compressed with gzip(1). jigdo-file always
outputs uncompressed files, which you can compress yourself.
jigdo-lite supports single uncompressed <br>
and compressed files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(Behaviour which may change in
the future and which should not be relied upon: jigdo
additionally supports any number of concatenated plaintext
and gzipped parts in the files - <br>
for example, you can compress a &lsquo;.jigdo&rsquo; file
and then add a couple of lines of uncompressed data to the
end.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In all cases, the
&lsquo;.gz&rsquo; extension should be removed from the
filename - the tools will determine automatically from the
file contents whether a file is compressed or not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Below is a description of the
individual section names used by jigdo.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">JIGDO SECTION <br>
[Jigdo] <br>
Version=1.1 <br>
Generator=jigdo-file/1.0.0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Information about the version of
the jigdo file format used, and the program that generated
it. There should be one such section per
&lsquo;.jigdo&rsquo; file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IMAGE SECTION <br>
[Image] <br>
Filename=&quot;filename for saving on user&rsquo;s
disc&quot; <br>
Template=&quot;URI where to fetch template file&quot; <br>
Template-MD5Sum=OQ8riqT1BuyzsrT9964A7g <br>
ShortInfo=single-line description of the image (200
characters max.) <br>
Info=long description (5000 characters max.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The value for the
&lsquo;Template&rsquo; entry can be either an URL (absolute
or relative to the URL of the jigdo file) or a string of the
form &lsquo;Label:pathname&rsquo; (UNIMPLEMENTED), as
described <br>
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The
&lsquo;Template-MD5Sum&rsquo; entry is added by jigdo-file
and specifies the MD5 checksum of the generated
&lsquo;.template&rsquo; file. It is used by jigdo to detect
cases where the downloaded tem&acirc; <br>
plate data is corrupted or belongs to a different image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unlike other entry values, the
values of the &lsquo;ShortInfo&rsquo; and &lsquo;Info&rsquo;
entries are not split up into words, instead all quoting is
preserved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The value of the
&lsquo;Info&rsquo; entry is special in that jigdo(1) can
optionally parse XML markup it contains. If the markup has
errors such as unbalanced/unsupported tags, the string is
<br>
displayed literally, without XML parsing. Supported tags are
&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; (bold), &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt; (italic),
&lt;tt&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; (typewriter font), &lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;
(underline), &lt;big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; (larger font), <br>
&lt;small&gt;&lt;/small&gt; (smaller font) and &lt;br/&gt;
(linebreak). Supported entities include &amp;lt;
(&lsquo;&lt;&rsquo;), &amp;gt; (&lsquo;&gt;&rsquo;) and
&amp;amp; (&lsquo;&amp;&rsquo;). Note that the whole
&lsquo;Info&rsquo; entry must be on one line in <br>
the jigdo file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This section may occur multiple
times, but all except the first one will be ignored. This is
useful e.g. when creating a &lsquo;.jigdo&rsquo; file for a
DVD image when you already have <br>
&lsquo;.jigdo&rsquo; files for CDs with the same content:
You can simply &lsquo;[Include]&rsquo; (see below) the
CDs&rsquo; jigdo files at the end of the DVD jigdo file,
after its &lsquo;[Image]&rsquo; section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PARTS SECTION <br>
[Parts] <br>
xJNkjrq8NYMraeGavUpllw=LabelA:part0 <br>
GoTResP2EC6Lb_2wTsqOoQ=LabelA:part1 <br>
kyfebwu6clbYqqWUdFIyaw=LabelB:some/path/part2 <br>
-J9UAimo0Bqg9c0oOXI1mQ=http://some.where.com/part3</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All lines in the section, which
provides the mapping from MD5 checksums to URIs, have the
same format: On the left side of the &lsquo;=&rsquo; the
checksum (encoded with a Base64-like encod&acirc; <br>
ing) is given, and on the right a string corresponding to
the part with this checksum; either a complete URI or a
string of the form &lsquo;Label:pathname&rsquo;, which is
expanded into one <br>
or more URIs by looking up the definition(s) for the Label
in the &lsquo;[Servers]&rsquo; section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In case a particular MD5
checksum cannot be found in any &lsquo;[Parts]&rsquo;
section by jigdo, the program will perform a lookup for
&lsquo;MD5Sum:&lt;checksum&gt;&rsquo;, e.g. for
&lsquo;MD5Sum:xJNkjrq8NYMrae&acirc; <br>
GavUpllw&rsquo; if you deleted the line for
&lsquo;part0&rsquo; above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A checksum appearing multiple
times in this section indicates alternative download
locations for the part.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There may be any number of
&lsquo;[Parts]&rsquo; sections in the file; they are all
considered when looking up MD5 checksums.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">jigdo-file always puts the
&lsquo;[Parts]&rsquo; section at the end of the file, and it
even rearranges any file specified with --merge to have only
one such section at the end. This is done <br>
to allow jigdo to display the information from the
&lsquo;[Image]&rsquo; section while the rest of that file is
still being downloaded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SERVERS SECTION <br>
[Servers] <br>
LabelA=http://myserver.org/ <br>
LabelA=ftp://mirror.myserver.org/ <br>
LabelB=LabelC:subdirectory/ <br>
LabelC=http://some.where.com/jigdo/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All lines in the section, which
provides the mapping from server labels to server locations,
have the same format: On the left side of the
&lsquo;=&rsquo; the label name is given, and on the <br>
right the value to expand the label name to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A label name appearing multiple
times in this section indicates alternative download
locations for the parts that use the label in the
&lsquo;[Parts]&rsquo; section. This notation makes it <br>
very easy to add mirrors to the jigdo file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As shown by the example above,
the label values may themselves reference other labels. In
this case, the entry &lsquo;LabelB:some/path/part2&rsquo; in
the &lsquo;[Parts]&rsquo; section will expand to <br>

&lsquo;http://some.where.com/jigdo/subdirectory/some/path/part2&rsquo;.
Loops in the label definitions result in undefined behaviour
and must be avoided.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There may be any number of
&lsquo;[Servers]&rsquo; sections in the file; they are all
considered when looking up labels. Either of
&lsquo;[Parts]&rsquo; or &lsquo;[Servers]&rsquo;, but not
both, can be omitted from <br>
the jigdo file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMENT SECTION <br>
[Comment] <br>
Any text, except that lines must not begin with
&lsquo;[&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All text following a
&lsquo;[Comment]&rsquo; or &lsquo;[comment]&rsquo; line is
ignored, up to the next line with a section label.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INCLUDE DIRECTIVE <br>
[Include http://some.url/file.jigdo]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Lines of this form cause the
content of the specified jigdo file to be downloaded and
parsed just like the main jigdo file. The effect will be the
same as copying the included <br>
file&rsquo;s contents into the file which contains the
include directive. (Exception: Any relative URLs are always
resolved using the URL of the &lsquo;.jigdo&rsquo; file that
contains that rela&acirc; <br>
tive URL.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The URL argument can be an
absolute or relative URL. Relative URLs are assumed to be
relative to the URL of the jigdo file which contains the
include directive. Includes can be <br>
nested, but it is an error to create a loop of include
directives. It is not possible to use URLs of the form
&lsquo;Label:pathname&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The URL cannot be quoted with
&quot;&quot;. Any &lsquo;]&rsquo; characters in the argument
must be escaped as &lsquo;%5D&rsquo;, and any spaces as
&lsquo;%20&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Include directives are only
supported by jigdo, they are ignored by jigdo-lite.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An include directive terminates
any previous section, but it does not start a new one. In
other words, a new section must always be started after the
include line, jigdo does not <br>
allow normal entries to appear below the
&lsquo;[Include]&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CACHE FILES <br>
Any file specified with the --cache option is used to store
information about the FILES presented to jigdo-file. When
querying the cache, a file is considered unchanged (and the
<br>
cached data is used) only if filename, file size and last
modification time (mtime) match exactly. For the filename
match, not the entire file name is used, but only the part
<br>
following any &lsquo;//&rsquo;, so that any changes to the
part before the &lsquo;//&rsquo; will not invalidate the
cache.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Old cache entries are removed
from the cache if they have not been read from or written to
for the amount of time specified with --cache-expiry.
Entries are not immediately <br>
removed from the cache if the file they refer to no longer
exists - this makes it possible to cache information about
files on removable media.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cache expiry only takes place
after jigdo-file has done its main work - if any old entries
are accessed before expiry takes place, they will be kept.
For example, if the program <br>
is run using the default expiry time of 30 days, but
accesses a cache file with entries generated 2 months ago,
then entries in that cache will be considered, and only
those <br>
cache entries that were not needed during the program run
will be expired.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Due to a peculiarity of the
underlying database library (libdb3), cache files never
shrink, they only grow. If a large number of entries was
expired from your cache file and you <br>
want it to shrink, you can either just delete it (of course
then everything will have to be regenerated) or use the
utilities accompanying libdb3 to dump and restore the
data&acirc; <br>
base, with a command like &lsquo;db3_dump old-cache.db |
db3_load new-cache.db&rsquo;. For Debian, these programs are
supplied in the package &lsquo;libdb3-util&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a different --md5-block-size
is specified, the entire file needs to be re-read to update
its cache entry. If a different --min-length is specified,
only the first &lsquo;md5-block- <br>
size&rsquo; bytes of the file need to be re-read.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
PREPARING YOUR CD IMAGE FOR DISTRIBUTION <br>
You have created a CD image &lsquo;image.iso&rsquo; from
some of the files stored in the directory
&lsquo;/home/ftp&rsquo; on your harddisc, which is also
available online as &lsquo;ftp://mysite.org&rsquo;. As you
<br>
don&rsquo;t want to waste space by effectively hosting the
same data twice (once as files on the FTP server, once
inside the image), and you are fed up with users&rsquo;
downloads aborting <br>
after 200MB and their restarting the download dozens of
times, you decide to use jigdo. How do you prepare the image
for download?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In fact, only one command is
necessary:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">jigdo-file make-template
--image=image.iso --jigdo=/home/ftp/image.jigdo
--template=/home/ftp/image.template /home/ftp// --label
Mysite=/home/ftp --uri <br>
Mysite=ftp://mysite.org/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">People can now point jigdo at
&lsquo;ftp://mysite.org/image.jigdo&rsquo; to download your
image. The template file needs to be accessible as
&lsquo;ftp://mysite.org/image.template&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that nothing prevents you
from doing the same for an FTP server that isn&rsquo;t
administrated by you - in that case, you only need to host
the &lsquo;.jigdo&rsquo; and &lsquo;.template&rsquo; files
on <br>
your own server/homepage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PREPARING AN ARBITRARY LARGE
FILE FOR DISTRIBUTION <br>
We assume that you have a large file that is not a
filesystem, e.g. &lsquo;movie.mpeg&rsquo;. Because of space
problems, you want to distribute the data on two
servers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In this case, the parts of the
image need to be generated artificially with the split
command. For example, to create chunks of 4MB each, use
&lsquo;split -b 4m movie.mpeg part&rsquo;. Copy <br>
the resulting files &lsquo;partXX&rsquo; into two
directories &lsquo;1&rsquo; and &lsquo;2&rsquo; that you
create, according to how you want the files distributed
between the servers. Next, create the jigdo and <br>
template files with &lsquo;jigdo-file make-template
--image=movie.mpeg 1// 2//&rsquo;. You will need to edit the
&lsquo;.jigdo&rsquo; file and provide the right URIs for the
two servers that you are <br>
going to upload the &lsquo;partXX&rsquo; files to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CUSTOMIZED VERSIONS OF IMAGES
<br>
Because it is possible to assign a different URI for each
part of an image if necessary, jigdo is very flexible. Only
one example is the possibility of customized versions of
<br>
images: Suppose that someone is distributing a CD image, and
that you want to make a few small changes to it and
redistribute your own version. You download the
&lsquo;official.iso&rsquo; CD <br>
image with jigdo (passing it the URL of
&lsquo;official.jigdo&rsquo;), write it to CD-R, make your
changes (say, adding files from the &lsquo;myfiles&rsquo;
directory on your harddisc) and produce your <br>
own version, &lsquo;myversion.iso&rsquo;. Next, you instruct
jigdo-file to create the jigdo and template files for your
modified image, using the command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">jigdo-file make-template
--image=myversion.iso /mnt/cdrom/ myfiles// --label
My=myfiles/ --uri My=http://my.homepage.net/
--merge=official.jigdo <br>
while &lsquo;official.iso&rsquo; is mounted under
&lsquo;/mnt/cdrom&rsquo;. By using --merge, you have told
jigdo-file to take the contents of
&lsquo;official.jigdo&rsquo;, add to it a new
&lsquo;[Image]&rsquo; section for <br>
&lsquo;myversion.iso&rsquo; and write the resulting jigdo
file to &lsquo;myversion.jigdo&rsquo; - so now
&lsquo;myversion.jigdo&rsquo; offers two images for
download, the original version and your modified version.
<br>
(If you do not want it to offer the official version, edit
it and remove the &lsquo;[Image]&rsquo; section that lists
&lsquo;official.iso&rsquo;.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Now you can upload the
&lsquo;.jigdo&rsquo; file, the &lsquo;.template&rsquo; file
and also the files in &lsquo;myfiles&rsquo; to
&lsquo;http://my.homepage.net/&rsquo;. Thus, for people to
download your modified image, you do <br>
not need to upload the complete image contents to your web
space, but only the changes you made!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(In case you only made very few
changes, you could also omit the &lsquo;myfiles&rsquo;
parameter in the command above, then all your changes end up
in the new template file.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMBINING MANY JIGDO-MANAGED
IMAGES INTO ONE <br>
It is also no problem to combine data from several sources
that use jigdo. For example, if of five different and
unrelated servers each one distributes a different CD image
via <br>
jigdo, you can create a customized DVD image that contains
the data from all these CDs. When people use jigdo to
download your image, the individual files on the DVD are
fetched <br>
from the same sources as the original CDs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Consequently, even though you
will be distributing a 3.2GB file via your web space, the
actual amount of data that is stored on your server will
only be in the order of several <br>
MBs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
For certain contents of one of the input files, most notably
a sequence of zero bytes longer than --min-length at the
start of the file and an area of zeros preceding the file
<br>
data in the image, jigdo-file make-template may fail to find
the file in the image. Unfortunately, this restriction
cannot be avoided because the program could become very slow
<br>
otherwise. If you use the --debug option, all instances of
jigdo-file discarding possible matches are indicated by
lines containing the word &lsquo;DROPPED&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In fact, not only all-zeroes
files trigger this behaviour, but also files which contain
at their start a long sequence of short identical strings.
For example, both a file con&acirc; <br>
taining only &lsquo;a&rsquo; characters and one containing
&lsquo;abcabcabcabc...&rsquo; are problematic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
