<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The ar utility is part of the Software Development Utilities
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ar utility can be used to
create and maintain groups of files combined into an
archive. Once an archive has been created, new files can be
added, and existing files in an ar&acirc; <br>
chive can be extracted, deleted, or replaced. When an
archive consists entirely of valid object files, the
implementation shall format the archive so that it is usable
as a <br>
library for link editing (see c99 and fort77). When some of
the archived files are not valid object files, the
suitability of the archive for library use is undefined. If
an <br>
archive consists entirely of printable files, the entire
archive shall be printable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When ar creates an archive, it
creates administrative information indicating whether a
symbol table is present in the archive. When there is at
least one object file that ar rec&acirc; <br>
ognizes as such in the archive, an archive symbol table
shall be created in the archive and maintained by ar; it is
used by the link editor to search the archive. Whenever the
ar <br>
utility is used to create or update the contents of such an
archive, the symbol table shall be rebuilt. The &acirc;s
option shall force the symbol table to be rebuilt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All file operands can be
pathnames. However, files within archives shall be named by
a filename, which is the last component of the pathname used
when the file was entered into <br>
the archive. The comparison of file operands to the names of
files in archives shall be performed by comparing the last
component of the operand to the name of the file in the <br>
archive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is unspecified whether
multiple files in the archive may be identically named. In
the case of such files, however, each file and posname
operand shall match only the first <br>
file in the archive having a name that is the same as the
last component of the operand.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The ar utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume
of POSIX.1&acirc;2008, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax
Guidelines, except for Guideline 9.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options shall be
supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;a Position new files in
the archive after the file named by the posname operand.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;b Position new files in
the archive before the file named by the posname
operand.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;c Suppress the diagnostic
message that is written to standard error by default when
the archive archive is created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;C Prevent extracted files
from replacing like-named files in the file system. This
option is useful when &acirc;T is also used, to prevent
truncated filenames from replacing <br>
files with the same prefix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;d Delete one or more
files from archive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;i Position new files in
the archive before the file in the archive named by the
posname operand (equivalent to &acirc;b).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;m Move the named files in
the archive. The &acirc;a, &acirc;b, or &acirc;i options
with the posname operand indicate the position; otherwise,
move the names files in the archive to the end <br>
of the archive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;p Write the contents of
the files in the archive named by file operands from archive
to the standard output. If no file operands are specified,
the contents of all files <br>
in the archive shall be written in the order of the
archive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;q Append the named files
to the end of the archive. In this case ar does not check
whether the added files are already in the archive. This is
useful to bypass the <br>
searching otherwise done when creating a large archive piece
by piece.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;r Replace or add files to
archive. If the archive named by archive does not exist, a
new archive shall be created and a diagnostic message shall
be written to standard <br>
error (unless the &acirc;c option is specified). If no files
are specified and the archive exists, the results are
undefined. Files that replace existing files in the archive
<br>
shall not change the order of the archive. Files that do not
replace existing files in the archive shall be appended to
the archive unless a &acirc;a, &acirc;b, or &acirc;i option
speci&acirc; <br>
fies another position.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;s Force the regeneration
of the archive symbol table even if ar is not invoked with
an option that modifies the archive contents. This option is
useful to restore the ar&acirc; <br>
chive symbol table after it has been stripped; see
strip.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;t Write a table of
contents of archive to the standard output. Only the files
specified by the file operands shall be included in the
written list. If no file operands <br>
are specified, all files in archive shall be included in the
order of the archive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;T Allow filename
truncation of extracted files whose archive names are longer
than the file system can support. By default, extracting a
file with a name that is too long <br>
shall be an error; a diagnostic message shall be written and
the file shall not be extracted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;u Update older files in
the archive. When used with the &acirc;r option, files in
the archive shall be replaced only if the corresponding file
has a modification time that is <br>
at least as new as the modification time of the file in the
archive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;v Give verbose output.
When used with the option characters &acirc;d, &acirc;r, or
&acirc;x, write a detailed file-by-file description of the
archive creation and maintenance activity, as <br>
described in the STDOUT section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When used with &acirc;p, write
the name of the file in the archive to the standard output
before writing the file in the archive itself to the
standard output, as described <br>
in the STDOUT section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When used with &acirc;t, include
a long listing of information about the files in the
archive, as described in the STDOUT section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;x Extract the files in
the archive named by the file operands from archive. The
contents of the archive shall not be changed. If no file
operands are given, all files in <br>
the archive shall be extracted. The modification time of
each file extracted shall be set to the time the file is
extracted from the archive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERANDS <br>
The following operands shall be supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">archive A pathname of the
archive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file A pathname. Only the last
component shall be used when comparing against the names of
files in the archive. If two or more file operands have the
same last pathname <br>
component (basename), the results are unspecified. The
implementation&rsquo;s archive format shall not truncate
valid filenames of files added to or replaced in the
archive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">posname The name of a file in
the archive, used for relative positioning; see options
&acirc;m and &acirc;r.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDIN <br>
Not used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUT FILES <br>
The archive named by archive shall be a file in the format
created by ar &acirc;r.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
The following environment variables shall affect the
execution of ar:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LANG Provide a default value for
the internationalization variables that are unset or null.
(See the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008,
Section 8.2, Internationaliza&acirc; <br>
tion Variables for the precedence of internationalization
variables used to determine the values of locale
categories.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_ALL If set to a non-empty
string value, override the values of all the other
internationalization variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_CTYPE Determine the locale
for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text data as
characters (for example, single-byte as opposed to
multi-byte characters in arguments <br>
and input files).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_MESSAGES <br>
Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
standard error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_TIME Determine the format and
content for date and time strings written by ar
&acirc;tv.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NLSPATH Determine the location
of message catalogs for the processing of LC_MESSAGES.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TMPDIR Determine the pathname
that overrides the default directory for temporary files, if
any.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TZ Determine the timezone used
to calculate date and time strings written by ar &acirc;tv.
If TZ is unset or null, an unspecified default timezone
shall be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDOUT <br>
If the &acirc;d option is used with the &acirc;v option, the
standard output format shall be:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;d &acirc; %s0,
&lt;file&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where file is the operand
specified on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the &acirc;p option is used
with the &acirc;v option, ar shall precede the contents of
each file with:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;0%s&gt;0, &lt;file&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where file is the operand
specified on the command line, if file operands were
specified, and the name of the file in the archive if they
were not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the &acirc;r option is used
with the &acirc;v option:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* If file is already in the

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;r &acirc; %s0,
&lt;file&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where &lt;file&gt; is the

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the &acirc;t option is used,
ar shall write the names of the files in the archive to the

Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following sections are
informative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">APPLICATION USAGE <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RATIONALE <br>
The archive format is not described. It is recognized that
there are several known ar formats, which are not
compatible. The ar utility is included, however, to allow
creation of <br>
archives that are intended for use only on one machine. The
archive is specified as a file, and it can be moved as a
file. This does allow an archive to be moved from one
machine <br>
to another machine that uses the same implementation of
ar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Utilities such as pax (and its
forebears tar and cpio) also provide portable
&lsquo;&lsquo;archives&rsquo;&rsquo;. This is a not a
duplication; the ar utility is included to provide an
interface primar&acirc; <br>
ily for make and the compilers, based on a historical
model.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In historical implementations,
the &acirc;q option (available on XSI-conforming systems) is
known to execute quickly because ar does not check on
whether the added members are already <br>
in the archive. This is useful to bypass the searching
otherwise done when creating a large archive piece-by-piece.
These remarks may but need not remain true for a brand new
<br>
implementation of this utility; hence, these remarks have
been moved into the RATIONALE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BSD implementations historically
required applications to provide the &acirc;s option
whenever the archive was supposed to contain a symbol table.
As in this volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008, <br>
System V historically creates or updates an archive symbol
table whenever an object file is removed from, added to, or
updated in the archive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The OPERANDS section requires
what might seem to be true without specifying it: the
archive cannot truncate the filenames below {NAME_MAX}. Some
historical implementations do <br>
so, however, causing unexpected results for the application.
Therefore, this volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008 makes the
requirement explicit to avoid misunderstandings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">According to the System V
documentation, the options &acirc;dmpqrtx are not required
to begin with a &lt;hyphen&gt; (&rsquo;&acirc;&rsquo;). This
volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008 requires that a conforming
application <br>
use the leading &lt;hyphen&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The archive format used by the
4.4 BSD implementation is documented in this RATIONALE as an
example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A file created by ar begins with
the &lsquo;&lsquo;magic&rsquo;&rsquo; string
&quot;!&lt;arch&gt;0. The rest of the archive is made up of
objects, each of which is composed of a header for a file, a
pos&acirc; <br>
sible filename, and the file contents. The header is
portable between machine architectures, and, if the file
contents are printable, the archive is itself printable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The header is made up of six
ASCII fields, followed by a two-character trailer. The
fields are the object name (16 characters), the file last
modification time (12 charac&acirc; <br>
ters), the user and group IDs (each 6 characters), the file
mode (8 characters), and the file size (10 characters). All
numeric fields are in decimal, except for the file <br>
mode, which is in octal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The modification time is the
file st_mtime field. The user and group IDs are the file
st_uid and st_gid fields. The file mode is the file st_mode
field. The file size is <br>
the file st_size field. The two-byte trailer is the string
&quot;&lsquo;&lt;newline&gt;&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Only the name field has any
provision for overflow. If any filename is more than 16
characters in length or contains an embedded space, the
string &quot;#1/&quot; followed by the <br>
ASCII length of the name is written in the name field. The
file size (stored in the archive header) is incremented by
the length of the name. The name is then written <br>
immediately following the archive header.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any unused characters in any of
these fields are written as &lt;space&gt; characters. If any
fields are their particular maximum number of characters in
length, there is no sep&acirc; <br>
aration between the fields.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Objects in the archive are
always an even number of bytes long; files that are an odd
number of bytes long are padded with a &lt;newline&gt;,
although the size in the header <br>
does not reflect this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ar utility description
requires that (when all its members are valid object files)
ar produce an object code library, which the linkage editor
can use to extract object mod&acirc; <br>
ules. If the linkage editor needs a symbol table to permit
random access to the archive, ar must provide it; however,
ar does not require a symbol table.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The BSD &acirc;o option was
omitted. It is a rare conforming application that uses ar to
extract object code from a library with concern for its
modification time, since this can only <br>
be of importance to make. Hence, since this functionality is
not deemed important for applications portability, the
modification time of the extracted files is set to the
cur&acirc; <br>
rent time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is at least one known
implementation (for a small computer) that can accommodate
only object files for that system, disallowing mixed object
and other files. The ability to <br>
handle any type of file is not only historical practice for
most implementations, but is also a reasonable
expectation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Consideration was given to
changing the output format of ar &acirc;tv to the same
format as the output of ls &acirc;l. This would have made
parsing the output of ar the same as that of ls. <br>
This was rejected in part because the current ar format is
commonly used and changes would break historical usage.
Second, ar gives the user ID and group ID in numeric format
<br>
separated by a &lt;slash&gt;. Changing this to be the user
name and group name would not be correct if the archive were
moved to a machine that contained a different user database.
<br>
Since ar cannot know whether the archive was generated on
the same machine, it cannot tell what to report.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The text on the &acirc;ur option
combination is historical practice&acirc;since one filename
can easily represent two different files (for example,
/a/foo and /b/foo), it is reasonable to <br>
replace the file in the archive even when the modification
time in the archive is identical to that in the file
system.</p>
