<p>DVISVGM(1) dvisvgm Manual DVISVGM(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
dvisvgm - converts DVI and EPS files to the XML-based SVG
format</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
dvisvgm [ options ] file [.dvi]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dvisvgm -E [ options ] file
[.eps]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The command-line utility dvisvgm converts DVI files, as
generated by TeX/LaTeX, to the XML-based scalable vector
graphics format SVG. It supports the classic DVI format 2 as
well <br>
as format 3 (created by pTeX in vertical mode), and the
XeTeX formats 5 and 6 which are also known as XDV. Besides
the basic DVI commands, dvisvgm also evaluates many
so-called <br>
specials which heavily extend the capabilities of the plain
DVI format. For a more detailed overview, see section
Supported Specials below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since the current SVG standard
1.1 doesn&acirc;t specify multi-page graphics, dvisvgm
creates separate SVG files for each DVI page. Because of
compatibility reasons, only the first <br>
page is converted by default. In order to select a different
page or arbitrary page sequences, use option -p which is
described below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SVG is a vector-based graphics
format and therefore dvisvgm tries to convert the glyph
outlines of all fonts referenced in a DVI page section to
scalable path descriptions. The <br>
fastest way to achieve this is to extract the path
information from vector-based font files available in PFB,
TTF, or OTF format. If dvisvgm is able to find such a file,
it <br>
extracts all necessary outline information about the glyphs
from it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, TeX&acirc;s main source
for font descriptions is Metafont, which produces bitmap
output (GF files). That&acirc;s why not all obtainable TeX
fonts are available in a scalable format. <br>
In these cases, dvisvgm tries to vectorize Metafont&acirc;s
output by tracing the glyph bitmaps. The results are not as
perfect as most (manually optimized) PFB or OTF
counterparts, <br>
but are nonetheless really nice in most cases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When running dvisvgm without
option --no-fonts, it creates font elements
(&lt;font&gt;...&lt;/font&gt;) to embed the font data into
the SVG files. Unfortunately, only few SVG renderes <br>
support these elements yet. Most web browsers and vector
graphics applications don&acirc;t evaluate them properly so
that the text components of the resulting graphics might
look <br>
strange. In order to create more compatible SVG files,
command-line option --no-fonts can be given to replace the
font elements by plain graphics paths.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
dvisvgm provides a POSIX-compliant command-line interface
with short and long option names. They may be given before
and/or after the name of the file to be converted. Also, the
<br>
order of specifying the options is not significant, i.e. you
can add them in any order without changing dvisvgm&acirc;s
behavior. Certain options accept or require additional <br>
parameters which are directly appended to or separated by
whitespace from a short option (e.g. -v0 or -v 0). Long
options require an additional equals sign (=) between option
<br>
name and argument but without any surrounding whitespace
(e.g. --verbosity=0).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a, --trace-all=[retrace] <br>
This option forces dvisvgm to vectorize not only the glyphs
actually required to render the SVG file correctly &acirc;
which is the default &acirc;, but processes all glyphs of
all fonts <br>
referenced in the DVI file. Because dvisvgm stores the
tracing results in a font cache, all following conversions
of these fonts will speed up significantly. The boolean <br>
option retrace determines how to handle glyphs already
stored in the cache. By default, these glyphs are skipped.
Setting argument retrace to yes or true forces dvisvgm to
<br>
retrace the corresponding bitmaps again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note <br>
This option only takes effect if font caching is active.
Therefore, --trace-all cannot be combined with option
--cache=none.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b, --bbox=fmt <br>
Sets the bounding box of the generated graphic to the
specified format. The parameter fmt takes either one of the
format specifiers listed below, or a sequence of four comma-
<br>
or whitespace-separated length values x1, y1, x2 and y2. The
latter define the absolute coordinates of two diagonal
corners of the bounding box. Each length value consists of
<br>
a floating point number and an optional length unit (pt, bp,
cm, mm, in, or pc). If the unit is omitted, TeX points (pt)
are assumed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It&acirc;s also possible to give
only one length value l. In this case, the minimal bounding
box is computed and enlarged by adding (-l,-l) to the upper
left and (l,l) to the lower <br>
right corner.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Additionally, dvisvgm also
supports the following format specifiers:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">International DIN/ISO paper
sizes <br>
An, Bn, Cn, Dn, where n is a non-negative integer, e.g. A4
or a4 for DIN/ISO A4 format (210mm &Atilde; 297mm).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">North American paper sizes <br>
invoice, executive, legal, letter, ledger</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Special bounding box sizes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dvi page size stored in the DVI
file <br>
min computes the minimal/tightest bounding box <br>
none no bounding box is assigned <br>
preview bounding box data computed by the preview package
(if present <br>
in the dvi file)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Page orientation <br>
The default page orientation for DIN/ISO and American paper
sizes is portrait, i.e. width &lt; height. Appending
-landscape or simply -l to the format string switches to
<br>
landscape mode (width &gt; height). For symmetry reasons you
can also explicitly add -portrait or -p to indicate the
default portrait format. Note that these suffixes are <br>
part of the size string and not separate options. Thus, they
must directly follow the size specifier without additional
blanks. Furthermore, the orientation suffixes <br>
can&acirc;t be used with dvi, min, and none.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note <br>
Option -b, --bbox only affects the bounding box and does not
transform the page content. Hence, if you choose a landscape
format, the page won&acirc;t be rotated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C, --cache[=dir] <br>
To speed up the conversion process of bitmap fonts, dvisvgm
saves intermediate conversion information in cache files. By
default, these files are stored in <br>
$HOME/.dvisvgm/cache. If you prefer a different location,
use option --cache to overwrite the default. Furthermore, it
is also possible to disable the font caching mechanism <br>
completely with option --cache=none. If argument dir is
omitted, dvisvgm prints the path of the default cache
directory together with further information about the stored
<br>
fonts. Additionally, outdated and corrupted cache files are
removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-j, --clipjoin <br>
This option tells dvisvgm to compute all intersections of
clipping paths itself rather than delegating this task to
the SVG renderer. The resulting SVG files are more <br>
portable because some SVG viewers don&acirc;t support
intersecting clipping paths which are defined by clipPath
elements containing a clip-path attribute.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--color <br>
Enables colorization of messages printed during the
conversion process. The colors can be customized via the
environment variable DVISVGM_COLORS. See the Environment
section <br>
below for further information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--colornames <br>
By default, dvisvgm exclusively uses RGB values of the form
#RRGGBB to represent colors in the SVG file. According to
the SVG standard, it&acirc;s also possible to use color
names <br>
(like black and darkblue) for a limited number of predefined
colors. In order to apply these color names rather than
their RGB values, call dvisvgm with option --colornames.
<br>
All colors without an SVG color name will still be
represented by RGB values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--comments <br>
Adds comments with further information about selected data
to the SVG file. Currently, only font elements and font CSS
rules related to native fonts are annotated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E, --eps <br>
If this option is given, dvisvgm does not expect a DVI but
an EPS input file, and tries to convert it to SVG. In order
to do so, a single psfile special command is created <br>
and forwarded to the PostScript special handler. This option
is only available if dvisvgm was built with PostScript
support enabled, and requires Ghostscript to be available.
<br>
See option --libgs for further information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e, --exact <br>
This option tells dvisvgm to compute the precise bounding
box of each character. By default, the values stored in a
font&acirc;s TFM file are used to determine a glyph&acirc;s
extent. As <br>
these values are intended to implement optimal character
placements and are not designed to represent the exact
dimensions, they don&acirc;t necessarily correspond with the
bounds <br>
of the visual glyphs. Thus, width and/or height of some
glyphs may be larger (or smaller) than the respective TFM
values. As a result, this can lead to clipped characters at
<br>
the bounds of the SVG graphics. With option --exact given,
dvisvgm analyzes the actual shape of each character and
derives a usually tight bounding box.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m, --fontmap=filenames <br>
Loads and evaluates a single font map file or a sequence of
font map files. These files are required to resolve font
file names and encodings. dvisvgm does not provide its <br>
own map files but tries to read available ones coming with
dvips or dvipdfm. If option --fontmap is omitted, dvisvgm
looks for the default map files ps2pk.map, dvipdfm.map, <br>
and psfonts.map (in this order). Otherwise, the files as
option arguments are evaluated in the given order. Multiple
filenames must be separated by commas without leading <br>
and/or trailing whitespace. By default, redefined mappings
do not replace previous ones. However, each filename can be
preceded by an optional mode specifier (+, -, or =) to <br>
change this behavior:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+mapfile <br>
Only those entries in the given map file that don&acirc;t
redefine a font mapping are applied, i.e. fonts already
mapped keep untouched. That&acirc;s also the default mode if
no mode <br>
specifier is given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mapfile <br>
Ensures that none of the font mappings defined in the given
map file are used, i.e. previously defined mappings for the
specified fonts are removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">=mapfile <br>
All mappings defined in the map file are applied. Previously
defined settings for the same fonts are replaced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the first filename in the
filename sequence is preceded by a mode specifier, dvisvgm
loads the default font map (see above) and applies the other
map files afterwards. <br>
Otherwise, none of default map files will be loaded
automatically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples:
--fontmap=myfile1.map,+myfile2.map loads myfile1.map
followed by myfile2.map where all redefinitions of
myfile2.map are ignored. <br>
--fontmap==myfile1.map,-myfile2.map loads the default map
file followed by myfile1.map and myfile2.map where all
redefinitions of myfile1.map replace previous entries. <br>
Afterwards, all definitions for the fonts given in
myfile2.map are removed from the font map tree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For further information about
the map file formats and the mode specifiers, see the
manuals of dvips and dvipdfm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--grad-overlap <br>
Tells dvisvgm to create overlapping grid segments when
approximating color gradient fills (also see option
--grad-segments below). By default, adjacent segments
don&acirc;t overlap <br>
but only touch each other like separate tiles. However, this
alignment can lead to visible gaps between the segments
because the background color usually influences the color
<br>
at the boundary of the segments if the SVG renderer uses
anti-aliasing to create smooth contours. One way to avoid
this and to create seamlessly touching color regions is to
<br>
enlarge the segments so that they extent into the area of
their right and bottom neighbors. Since the latter are drawn
on top of the overlapping parts, the visible size of <br>
all segments keeps unchanged. Just the former gaps disappear
as the background is now completely covered by the correct
colors. Currently, dvisvgm computes the overlapping <br>
segments separately for each patch of the mesh (a patch mesh
may consist of multiple patches of the same type).
Therefore, there still might be visible gaps at the seam of
<br>
two adjacent patches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--grad-segments=number <br>
Determines the maximal number of segments per column and row
used to approximate gradient color fills. Since SVG 1.1 only
supports a small subset of the shading algorithms <br>
available in PostScript, dvisvgm approximates some of them
by subdividing the area to be filled into smaller,
monochromatic segments. Each of these segments gets the
average <br>
color of the region it covers. Thus, increasing the number
of segments leads to smaller monochromatic areas and
therefore a better approximation of the actual color
gradient. <br>
As a drawback, more segments imply bigger SVG files because
every segment is represented by a separate path element.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Currently, dvisvgm supports
free- and lattice-form triangular patch meshes as well as
Coons and tensor-product patch meshes. They are approximated
by subdividing the area of <br>
each patch into a n&Atilde;n grid of smaller segments. The
maximal number of segments per column and row can be changed
with option --grad-segments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--grad-simplify=delta <br>
If the size of the segments created to approximate gradient
color fills falls below the given delta value, dvisvgm
reduces their level of detail. For example,
B&Atilde;&copy;zier curves <br>
are replaced by straight lines, and triangular segments are
combined to tetragons. For a small delta, these
simplifications are usually not noticeable but reduce the
size of <br>
the generated SVG files significantly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help[=mode] <br>
Prints a short summary of all available command-line
options. The optional mode parameter is an integer value
between 0 and 2. It selects the display variant of the help
<br>
text. Mode 0 lists all options divided into categories with
section headers. This is also the default if dvisvgm is
called without parameters. Mode 1 lists all options <br>
ordered by the short option names, while mode 2 sorts the
lines by the long option names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--keep <br>
Disables the removal of temporary files as created by
Metafont (usually .gf, .tfm, and .log files).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--libgs=filename <br>
This option is only available if the Ghostscript library is
not directly linked to dvisvgm and if PostScript support was
not completely disabled during compilation. In this <br>
case, dvisvgm tries to load the shared GS library
dynamically during runtime. By default, it expects the
library&acirc;s name to be libgs.so.X (on Unix-like systems,
where X is the <br>
ABI version of the library) or gsdll32.dll/gsdll64.dll
(Windows). Option --libgs can be used to give a different
name. Alternatively, it&acirc;s also possible to set the GS
library <br>
name by the environment variable LIBGS. The latter has less
precedence than the command-line option, i.e. dvisvgm
ignores variable LIBGS if --libgs is given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L, --linkmark=style <br>
Selects the method how to mark hyperlinked areas. The style
argument can take one of the values none, box, and line,
where box is the default, i.e. a rectangle is drawn <br>
around the linked region if option --linkmark is omitted.
Style argument line just draws the lower edge of the
bounding rectangle, and none tells dvisvgm not to add any
<br>
visible objects to hyperlinks. The lines and boxes get the
current text color selected. In order to apply a different,
constant color, a colon followed by a color specifier <br>
can be appended to the style string. A color specifier is
either a hexadecimal RGB value of the form #RRGGBB, or a
dvips color name <br>

(http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Colors#The_68_standard_colors_known_to_dvips).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Moreover, argument style can
take a single color specifier to highlight the linked region
by a frameless box filled with that color. An optional
second color specifier <br>
separated by a colon selects the frame color.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples: box:red or box:#ff0000
draws red boxes around the linked areas. yellow:blue creates
yellow filled rectangles with blue frames.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, --list-specials <br>
Prints a list of registered special handlers and exits. Each
handler processes a set of special statements belonging to
the same category. In most cases, the categories are <br>
identified by the prefix of the special statements.
It&acirc;s usually a leading word separated from the rest of
the statement by a colon or a blank, e.g. color or ps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M, --mag=factor <br>
Sets the magnification factor applied in conjunction with
Metafont calls prior tracing the glyphs. The larger this
value, the better the tracing results. Nevertheless, large
<br>
magnification values can cause Metafont arithmetic errors
due to number overflows. So, use this option with care. The
default setting usually produces nice results.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-merge <br>
Puts every single character in a separate text element with
corresponding x and y attributes. By default, new text or
tspan elements are only created if a string starts at a <br>
location that differs from the regular position defined by
the characters&rsquo; advance values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-mktexmf <br>
Suppresses the generation of missing font files. If dvisvgm
can&acirc;t find a font file through the kpathsea lookup
mechanism, it calls the external tools mktextfm or mktexmf.
<br>
This option disables these calls.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --no-fonts[=variant] <br>
If this option is given, dvisvgm doesn&acirc;t create SVG
font elements but uses paths instead. The resulting SVG
files tend to be larger but they are concurrently more
compatible <br>
with most applications that don&acirc;t support SVG fonts
yet. The optional argument variant selects the method how to
substitute fonts by paths. Variant 0 creates path and use
<br>
elements in order to avoid lengthy duplicates. Variant 1
creates path elements only. Option --no-fonts implies
--no-styles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --scale=sx[,sy] <br>
Scales the page content horizontally by sx and vertically by
sy. This option is equivalent to -TSsx,sy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S, --no-specials[=names] <br>
Disable processing of special commands embedded in the DVI
file. If no further parameter is given, all specials are
ignored. To disable a selected set of specials, an <br>
optional comma-separated list of names can be appended to
this option. A name is the unique identifier referencing the
intended special handler. Option --list-specials lists <br>
all handlers currently available together with their names.
All unsupported special statements are silently ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-styles <br>
By default, dvisvgm creates CSS styles and class attributes
to reference fonts. This variant is more compact than adding
the complete font information to each text element <br>
over and over again. However, if you prefer direct font
references, the default behavior can be disabled with option
--no-styles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o, --output=pattern <br>
Sets the pattern specifying the names of the generated SVG
files. Parameter pattern is a string that may contain static
character sequences as well as the variables %f, %p, <br>
and %P. %f expands to the base name of the DVI file, i.e.
the filename without suffix, %p is the current page number,
and %P the total number of pages in the DVI file. An <br>
optional number (0-9) given directly after the percent sign
specifies the minimal number of digits to be written. If a
particular value consists of less digits, the number is <br>
padded with leading zeros. Example: %3p enforces 3 digits
for the current page number (001, 002, etc.). Without an
explicit width specifier, %p gets the same number of digits
<br>
as %P.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you need more control over
the numbering, you can use arithmetic expressions as part of
a pattern. The syntax is %(expr) where expr may contain
additions, subtractions, <br>
multiplications, and integer divisions with common
precedence. The variables p and P contain the current page
number and the total number of pages, respectively. For
example, <br>
--output=&quot;%f-%(p-1)&quot; creates filenames where the
numbering starts with 0 rather than 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default pattern is %f-%p.svg
if the DVI file consists of more than one page, and %f.svg
otherwise. That means, a DVI file foo.dvi is converted to
foo.svg if foo.dvi is a <br>
single-page document. Otherwise, multiple SVG files
foo-01.svg, foo-02.svg, etc. are produced. In Windows
environments, the percent sign indicates dereferenced
environment <br>
variables, and must therefore be protected by a second
percent sign, e.g. --output=%%f-%%p.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, --page=ranges <br>
This option selects the pages to be processed. Parameter
ranges consists of a comma-separated list of single page
numbers and/or page ranges. A page range is a pair of <br>
numbers separated by a hyphen, e.g. 5-12. Thus, a page
sequence might look like this: 2-4,6,9-12,15. It
doesn&acirc;t matter if a page is given more than once or if
page ranges <br>
overlap. dvisvgm always extracts the page numbers in
ascending order and converts them only once. In order to
stay compatible with previous versions, the default page
<br>
sequence is 1. dvisvgm therefore converts only the first
page and not the whole document if option --page is omitted.
Usually, page ranges consist of two numbers denoting the
<br>
first and last page to be converted. If the conversion
should start at page 1, or if it should continue up to the
last DVI page, the first or second range number can be <br>
omitted, respectively. Example: --page=-10 converts all
pages up to page 10, --page=10- converts all pages starting
with page 10. Please consider that the page values
don&acirc;t <br>
refer to the page numbers printed on the corresponding page.
Instead, the physical page count is expected, where the
first page always gets number 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --precision=digits <br>
Specifies the maximal number of decimal places applied to
floating-point attribute values. All attribute values
written to the generated SVG file(s) are rounded
accordingly. <br>
The parameter digits allows integer values from 0 to 6,
where 0 enables the automatic selection of significant
decimal places. This is also the default value if dvisvgm is
<br>
called without option --precision.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P, --progress[=delay] <br>
Enables a simple progress indicator shown when
time-consuming operations like PostScript specials are
processed. The indicator doesn&acirc;t appear before the
given delay (in <br>
seconds) has elapsed. The default delay value is 0.5
seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, --rotate=angle <br>
Rotates the page content clockwise by angle degrees around
the page center. This option is equivalent to -TRangle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R, --relative <br>
SVG allows to define graphics paths by a sequence of
absolute and/or relative path commands, i.e. each command
expects either absolute coordinates or coordinates relative
to <br>
the current drawing position. By default, dvisvgm creates
paths made up of absolute commands. If option --relative is
given, relative commands are created instead. This <br>
slightly reduces the size of the SVG files in most
cases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --stdout <br>
Don&acirc;t write the SVG output to a file but redirect it
to stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T, --transform=commands <br>
Applies a sequence of transformations to the SVG content.
Each transformation is described by a command beginning with
a capital letter followed by a list of comma-separated <br>
parameters. Following transformation commands are
supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">T tx[,ty] <br>
Translates (moves/shifts) the page in direction of vector
(tx,ty). If ty is omitted, ty=0 is assumed. The expected
unit length of tx and ty are TeX points (1pt = <br>
1/72.27in). However, there are several constants defined to
simplify the unit conversion (see below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">S sx[,sy] <br>
Scales the page horizontally by sx and vertically by sy. If
sy is omitted, sy=sx is assumed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">R angle[,x,y] <br>
Rotates the page clockwise by angle degrees around point
(x,y). If the optional arguments x and y are omitted, the
page will be rotated around its center depending on the <br>
chosen page format. When option -bnone is given, the
rotation center is origin (0,0).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KX angle <br>
Skews the page along the x-axis by angle degrees. Argument
angle can take any value except 90+180k, where k is an
integer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KY angle <br>
Skews the page along the y-axis by angle degrees. Argument
angle can take any value except 90+180k, where k is an
integer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FH [y] <br>
Mirrors (flips) the page at the horizontal line through
point (0,y). Omitting the optional argument leads to y=h/2,
where h denotes the page height (see pre-defined <br>
constants below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FV [x] <br>
Mirrors (flips) the page at the vertical line through point
(x,0). Omitting the optional argument leads to x=w/2, where
w denotes the page width (see pre-defined <br>
constants below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">M m1,...,m6 <br>
Applies a transformation described by the 3&Atilde;3 matrix
((m1,m2,m3),(m4,m5,m6),(0,0,1)), where the inner triples
denote the rows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note <br>
All transformation commands of option -T, --transform are
applied in the order of their appearance. Multiple commands
can optionally be separated by spaces. In this <br>
case the whole transformation string has to be enclosed in
double quotes to keep them together. All parameters are
expressions of floating point type. You can either <br>
give plain numbers or arithmetic terms combined by the
operators + (addition), - (subtraction), * (multiplication),
/ (division) or % (modulo) with common <br>
associativity and precedence rules. Parentheses may be used
as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Additionally, some pre-defined
constants are provided:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ux horizontal position of upper
left page corner in TeX point <br>
units <br>
uy vertical position of upper left page corner in TeX point
units <br>
h page height in TeX point units (0 in case of -bnone) <br>
w page width in TeX point units (0 in case of -bnone)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Furthermore, you can use the
length constants pt, mm, cm and in, e.g. 2cm or 1.6in. Thus,
option -TT1in,0R45 moves the page content 1 inch to the
right and rotates <br>
it by 45 degrees around the page center afterwards.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For single transformations,
there are also the short-hand options -c, -t and -r
available. In contrast to the --transform* commands, the
order of these options is not <br>
significant, so that it&acirc;s not possible to describe
transformation sequences with them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t, --translate=tx[,ty] <br>
Translates (moves) the page content in direction of vector
(tx,ty). This option is equivalent to -TTtx,ty.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbosity=level <br>
Controls the type of messages printed during a dvisvgm
run:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 no message output at all <br>
1 error messages only <br>
2 warning messages only <br>
4 informational messages only</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note <br>
By adding these values you can combine the categories. The
default level is 7, i.e. all messages are printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version[=extended] <br>
Prints the version of dvisvgm and exits. If the optional
argument is set to yes, the version numbers of the linked
libraries are printed as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z, --zip[=level] <br>
Creates a compressed SVG file with suffix .svgz. The
optional argument specifies the compression level. Valid
values are in the range of 1 to 9 (default value is 9).
Larger <br>
values cause better compression results but may take
slightly more computation time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Caution <br>
This option cannot be combined with -s, --stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Z, --zoom[=factor] <br>
Multiplies the width and height attributes of the SVG root
element by argument factor while the coordinate system of
the graphic content is retained. As a result, most SVG <br>
viewers zoom the graphics accordingly. If a negative zoom
factor is given, the width and height attributes are
omitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SUPPORTED SPECIALS <br>
dvisvgm supports several sets of special commands that can
be used to enrich DVI files with additional features, like
color, graphics, and hyperlinks. The evaluation of special
<br>
commands is delegated to dedicated handlers provided by
dvisvgm. Each handler is responsible for all special
statements of the same command set, i.e. commands beginning
with the <br>
same prefix. To get a list of the actually provided special
handlers, use option --list-specials (see above). This
section gives an overview of the special commands currently
<br>
supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bgcolor <br>
Special statement for changing the background/page color.
Since SVG 1.1 doesn&acirc;t support background colors,
dvisvgm inserts a rectangle of the chosen color into the
generated <br>
SVG document. This rectangle always gets the same size as
the selected or computed bounding box. This background color
command is part of the color special set but is handled <br>
separately in order to let the user turn it off. For an
overview of the command syntax, see the documentation of
dvips, for instance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">color <br>
Statements of this command set provide instructions to
change the text/paint color. For an overview of the exact
syntax, see the documentation of dvips, for instance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dvisvgm <br>
dvisvgm offers its own small set of specials. The following
list gives a brief overview.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dvisvgm:raw text <br>
Adds an arbitrary sequence of characters to the page section
of the SVG document. dvisvgm does not perform any validation
here, thus the user has to ensure that the <br>
resulting SVG is still valid. Parameter text may contain the
expressions {?x}, {?y}, and {?color} that expand to the
current x or y coordinate and the current color, <br>
respectively. Furthermore, {?nl} expands to a newline
character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dvisvgm:rawdef text <br>
This command is similar to dvisvgm:raw, but puts the raw
text into the &lt;defs&gt; section of the SVG document
currently being generated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dvisvgm:rawset name ...
dvisvgm:endrawset <br>
This pair of specials marks the begin and end of a
definition of a named raw SVG fragment. All dvisvgm:raw and
dvisvgm:rawdef specials enclosed by dvisvgm:rawset and <br>
dvisvgm:endrawset are not evaluated immediately but jointly
stored under the given name for later use. Once defined, the
named fragment can be referenced throughout the <br>
DVI file by dvisvgm:rawput (see below). The two commands
dvisvgm:rawset and dvisvgm:endrawset must not be nested,
i.e. each call of dvisvgm:rawset has to be followed by a
<br>
corresponding call of dvisvgm:endrawset before another
dvisvgm:rawset may occur. Also, the identifier name must be
unique throughout the DVI file. Using dvisvgm:rawset <br>
multiple times together with the same name leads to warning
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dvisvgm:rawput name <br>
Inserts raw SVG fragments previously stored under the given
name. dvisvgm distinguishes between fragments that were
specified with dvisvgm:raw or dvisvgm:rawdef, and <br>
handles them differently: It inserts all dvisvgm:raw parts
every time dvisvgm:rawput is called, whereas the
dvisvgm:rawdef portions go to the &lt;defs&gt; section of
the <br>
current SVG document only once.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dvisvgm:img width height file
<br>
Creates an image element at the current graphic position
referencing the given file. JPEG, PNG, and SVG images can be
used here. However, dvisvgm does not check the file <br>
format or the file name suffix. The lengths width and height
must be given as plain floating point numbers in TeX point
units (1in = 72.27pt).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dvisvgm:bbox n[ew] name <br>
Defines or resets a local bounding box called name. The name
may consist of letters and digits. While processing a DVI
page, dvisvgm continuously updates the (global) <br>
bounding box of the current page in order to determine the
minimal rectangle containing all visible page components
(characters, images, drawing elements etc.) <br>
Additionally to the global bounding box, the user can
request an arbitrary number of named local bounding boxes.
Once defined, these boxes are updated together with the <br>
global bounding box starting with the first character that
follows the definition. Thus, the local boxes can be used to
compute the extent of parts of the page. This is <br>
useful for scenarios where the generated SVG file is
post-processed. In conjunction with special dvisvgm:raw, the
macro {?bbox name} expands to the four values x, y, w, <br>
and h (separated by spaces) specifying the coordinates of
the upper left corner, width, and height of the local box
name. If box name wasn&acirc;t previously defined, all four
<br>
values equal to zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dvisvgm:bbox width height
[depth] <br>
Updates the bounding box of the current page by embedding a
virtual rectangle (x, y, width, height) where the lower left
corner is located at the current DVI drawing <br>
position (x,y). If the optional parameter depth is
specified, dvisvgm embeds a second rectangle (x, y, width,
-depth). The lengths width, height and depth must be given
<br>
as plain floating point numbers in TeX point units (1in =
72.27pt). Depending on size and position of the virtual
rectangle, this command either enlarges the overall <br>
bounding box or leaves it as is. It&acirc;s not possible to
reduce its extent. This special should be used in
conjunction with dvisvgm:raw in order to update the viewport
of <br>
the page properly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dvisvgm:bbox a[bs] x1 y1 x2 y2
<br>
This variant of the bbox special updates the bounding box by
embedding a virtual rectangle (x1,y1,x2,y2). The points
(x1,y1) and (x2,y2) denote two diagonal corners of <br>
the rectangle given in TeX point units.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dvisvgm:bbox f[ix] x1 y1 x2 y2
<br>
This variant of the bbox special assigns an absolute (final)
bounding box to the resulting SVG. After executing this
command, dvisvgm doesn&acirc;t further alter the bounding
<br>
box coordinates, except this special is called again later.
The points (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) denote two diagonal corners
of the rectangle given in TeX point units.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following TeX snippet adds
two raw SVG elements to the output and updates the bounding
box accordingly:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cial{dvisvgm:raw &lt;circle
cx=&rsquo;{?x}&rsquo; cy=&rsquo;{?y}&rsquo;
r=&rsquo;10&rsquo; stroke=&rsquo;black&rsquo;
fill=&rsquo;red&rsquo;/&gt;} <br>
cial{dvisvgm:bbox 20 10 10}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cial{dvisvgm:raw &lt;path
d=&rsquo;M50 200 L10 250 H100 Z&rsquo;
stroke=&rsquo;black&rsquo; fill=&rsquo;blue&rsquo;/&gt;}
<br>
cial{dvisvgm:bbox abs 10 200 100 250}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">em <br>
These specials were introduced with the emTeX distribution
by Eberhard Mattes. They provide line drawing statements,
instructions for embedding MSP, PCX, and BMP image files,
<br>
as well as two PCL commands. dvisvgm supports only the line
drawing statements and ignores all other em specials
silently. A description of the command syntax can be found
in <br>
the DVI driver documentation coming with emTeX
(http://www.ctan.org/pkg/emtex).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">html <br>
The hyperref specification defines several variants on how
to mark hyperlinked areas in a DVI file. dvisvgm supports
the plain HyperTeX special constructs as created with <br>
hyperref package option hypertex. By default, all linked
areas of the document are marked by a rectangle. Option
--linkmark allows to change this behavior. See above for
<br>
further details. Information on syntax and semantics of the
HyperTeX specials can be found in the hyperref manual
(http://www.ctan.org/pkg/hyperref).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pdf <br>
pdfTeX and dvipdfmx introduced several special commands
related to the generation of PDF files. Currently, only two
of them, pdf:mapfile and pdf:mapline are supported by <br>
dvisvgm. These specials allow modifying the font map tree
during the processing of DVI files. They are used by CTeX,
for example. dvisvgm supports both, the dvips and dvipdfm
<br>
font map format. For further information on the command
syntax and semantics, see the documentation of dfmapfile in
the pdfTeX user manual (http://www.ctan.org/pkg/pdftex).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ps <br>
The famous DVI driver dvips introduced its own set of
specials in order to embed PostScript code into DVI files,
which greatly improves the capabilities of DVI documents.
One <br>
aim of dvisvgm is to completely evaluate all PostScript
snippets and to convert as many of them as possible to SVG.
In contrast to dvips, dvisvgm uses floating point <br>
arithmetics to compute the precise position of each graphic
element, i.e. it doesn&acirc;t round the coordinates.
Therefore, the relative locations of the graphic elements
may <br>
slightly differ from those computed by dvips.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since PostScript is a rather
complex language, dvisvgm does not try to implement its own
PostScript interpreter but relies on Ghostscript
(http://ghostscript.com) instead. If <br>
the Ghostscript library was not linked to the dvisvgm
binary, it is looked up and loaded dynamically during
runtime. In this case, dvisvgm looks for libgs.so.X on
Unix-like <br>
systems (supported ABI versions: 7,8,9), and for gsdll32.dll
or gsdll64.dll on Windows. You can override the default file
names with environment variable LIBGS or the <br>
command-line option --libgs. The library must be reachable
through the ld search path (*nix) or the PATH environment
variable (Windows). Alternatively, the absolute file path
<br>
can be specified. If the library cannot be found, dvisvgm
disables the processing of PostScript specials and prints a
warning message. Use option --list-specials to check <br>
whether PostScript support is available, i.e. entry ps is
present.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The PostScript handler also
recognizes and evaluates bounding box data generated by the
preview package (http://www.ctan.org/pkg/preview) with
option tightpage. If such data <br>
is present in the DVI file and if dvisvgm is called with
option --bbox=preview, dvisvgm adapts the bounding box of
the generated SVG file accordingly, and prints a message
<br>
showing the width, height, and depth of the box in TeX point
units. Especially, the depth value can be used to vertically
align the SVG graphics with the baseline of <br>
surrounding text in HTML or XSL-FO documents, for example.
If you call dvisvgm with option --bbox=min (the default),
the tight bounding box computed while processing the page
<br>
is applied and not the one provided by the preview package.
Thus, the height, depth and width values written to the
console are adapted accordingly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tpic <br>
The TPIC special set defines instructions for drawing simple
geometric objects. Some LaTeX packages, like eepic and
tplot, use these specials to describe graphics.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
dvisvgm file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Converts the first page of
file.dvi to file.svg.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dvisvgm -z file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Converts the first page of
file.dvi to file.svgz with default compression level 9.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dvisvgm -p5 -z3 -ba4-l -onewfile
file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Converts the fifth page of
file.dvi to newfile.svgz with compression level 3. The
bounding box is set to DIN/ISO A4 in landscape format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dvisvgm
--transform=&quot;R20,w/3,2h/5 T1cm,1cm S2,3&quot; file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Converts the first page of
file.dvi to file.svg where three transformations are
applied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
dvisvgm uses the kpathsea library for locating the files
that it opens. Hence, the environment variables described in
the library&acirc;s documentation influence the
converter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If dvisvgm was linked without
the Ghostscript library, and if PostScript support has not
been disabled, the shared Ghostscript library is looked up
during runtime via dlopen(). <br>
The environment variable LIBGS can be used to specify path
and file name of the library.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The pre-compiled Windows
versions of dvisvgm require a working installation of MiKTeX
2.9 or above. dvisvgm does not work together with the
portable edition of MiKTeX because it <br>
relies on MiKTeX&acirc;s COM interface that is only
accessible in a local installation. To enable the evaluation
of PostScript specials, the original Ghostscript DLL
gsdll32.dll must <br>
be present and reachable through the search path. 64-bit
Windows builds require the 64-bit Ghostscript DLL
gsdll64.dll. Both DLLs come with the corresponding
Ghostscript <br>
installers available from http://ghostscript.com.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The environment variable
DVISVGM_COLORS specifies the colors used to highlight
various parts of dvisvgm&acirc;s message output. It is only
evaluated if option --color is given. The <br>
value of DVISVGM_COLORS is a list of colon-separated entries
of the form gg=BF, where gg denotes one of the color group
indicators listed below, and BF are two hexadecimal digits
<br>
specifying the background (first digit) and foreground/text
color (second digit). The color values are defined as
follows: 0=black, 1=red, 2=green, 3=yellow, 4=blue,
5=magenta, <br>
6=cyan, 7=gray, 8=bright red, 9=bright green, A=bright
yellow, B=bright blue, C=bright magenta, D=bright cyan,
E=bright gray, F=white. Depending on the terminal, the
colors may <br>
differ. Rather than changing both the text and background
color, it&acirc;s also possible to change only one of them:
An asterisk (*) in place of a hexadecimal digit indicates
the <br>
default text or background color of the terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All malformed entries in the
list are silently ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">er error messages</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wn warning messages</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pn messages about page
numbers</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ps page size messages</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fw information about the files
written</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sm state messages</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tr messages of the glyph

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pi progress indicator</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example: er=01:pi=*5 sets the
colors of error messages (er) to red (1) on black (0), and
those of progress indicators (pi) to cyan (5) on default
background (*).</p>
