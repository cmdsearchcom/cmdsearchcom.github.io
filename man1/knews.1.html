<p style="margin-top: 1em">KNEWS(1) General Commands Manual
KNEWS(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
knews - Karl&rsquo;s threaded newsreader for X</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
knews [ options ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Knews is a threaded newsreader with an X Window interface
that uses NNTP to get news. This manual is intended to
explain things that are not apparent from the interface, so
if <br>
you just want to get started, you probably don&rsquo;t need
to read this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
In addition to the standard X Toolkit options knews accepts
the following options, which set various X resources. For an
explanation of what the resources do, see the sections <br>
on resources and the config file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You don&rsquo;t have to type out
the entire name of the option, as long as it is unique.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nntpServer hostname <br>
Sets the resource &rsquo;Knews.nntpServer&rsquo; to
&rsquo;hostname&rsquo;. This will cause knews to connect to
this server on startup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+/-bell <br>
Sets the resource &rsquo;Knews.bell&rsquo; to
True/False.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+/-separate <br>
Sets the resource &rsquo;Knews.separateWindows&rsquo; to
True/False.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+/-active <br>
Sets the resource &rsquo;Knews.readActiveFile&rsquo; to
True/False.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+/-descriptions <br>
Sets the resource &rsquo;Knews.retrieveDescriptions&rsquo;
to True/False.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+/-fill <br>
Sets the resource &rsquo;Knews.fillNewsrcFile&rsquo; to
True/False.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+/-keep <br>
Sets the resource &rsquo;Knews.keepThreadInfo&rsquo; to
True/False.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-install <br>
This will make knews install its own colormap.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-visual class <br>
-depth bits <br>
These will set the resources &rsquo;Knews.visualClass&rsquo;
and &rsquo;Knews.visualDepth&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+/-icase <br>
Will set the resource &rsquo;Knews.icaseRegexps&rsquo; to
True/False.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+/-images <br>
This will turn on/off inline images and color
allocation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ncols number <br>
Sets the resource Knews.nCols to &rsquo;number&rsquo;, which
is the max number of colors knews will allocate for inline
images.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-version <br>
Prints out the version and compile time to stderr and
quits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THE THREAD TREE <br>
The articles in a thread are displayed as nodes in a tree. A
border inside a node indicates that the article is unread, a
border outside a node indicates that the article is <br>
&rsquo;tagged&rsquo;, and a dashed branch in the tree
indicates a change of subject. By default, you can scroll
around in the tree with the middle mouse button. An empty
box in the tree <br>
indicates a &rsquo;fake&rsquo; article, i.e. one that has
expired on the server, has not yet arrived or was posted in
a different newsgroup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TAGGING ARTICLES <br>
Articles in the thread tree can be tagged with the third
mouse button. Clicking on a subject with the third mouse
button causes the unread articles in that thread to be
tagged <br>
in preorder (depth first). Once you have tagged the
articles, you can mark then read/unread, save or pipe them
in order, and so on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CLICKING ON URLS <br>
Knews supports a simple form of clicking on URLs. It works
by selecting a piece of text in the article text window and
clicking on it with the middle mouse button. If there is
<br>
no selection, knews will make a crude guess as to what the
URL might be. The resource Knews.urlCommand must be set for
this to work, see the section on X resources for
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DRAG AND DROP <br>
The all groups list and the kill list can be reordered by
drag&rsquo;n&rsquo;drop. The default translation is the
second mouse button.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ABORT <br>
You may abort the interaction with the NNTP server at any
time. This causes the connection to be closed, and a new one
to be opened. Note that this puts a certain load on the <br>
server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THREAD AHEAD <br>
Knews is capable of threading groups in the background while
you are e.g. reading another group. To do this you click on
one or more groups in the group list with the right <br>
mouse button. Knews then opens a second connection to the
server and uses it to thread the selected groups. The status
of the thread ahead is shown in the group list as a
char&acirc; <br>
acter:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- The group is scheduled for
thread ahead. <br>
* The group is being threaded. <br>
+ The group has been threaded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REGULAR EXPRESSIONS <br>
The regular expressions used by knews are POSIX.2 extended
regular expressions, similar to those used by egrep(1), by
default case insensitive. Note that these are not anchored
<br>
by default, so that e.g. the expression &rsquo;alt&rsquo;
will match any string containing the three character
sequence &rsquo;alt&rsquo;. See Henry Spencer&rsquo;s
excellent man-page for details, regex(7).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEARCHING <br>
Article heads and bodies may be searched for regular
expressions. Searching applies to read or unread articles as
specified with the &rsquo;only unread&rsquo; toggle, and
starts with the <br>
&rsquo;next&rsquo; article. The newsgroup list may also be
searched.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: the &rsquo;Stop&rsquo;
button stops the search as soon as the current article has
been retrieved from the server. This is different from
&rsquo;Abort&rsquo; which requires closing and reopening
<br>
the connection to the server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is also possible to use XPAT
searching, if the nntp server supports it. To do this, you
fill in the &rsquo;Header&rsquo; field on the search popup
with the header you&rsquo;re interested in <br>
(e.g. &rsquo;Content-Type&rsquo;) and the wildcard field
with a wildcard expression. Pressing &rsquo;Submit&rsquo;
then sends this to the server, and after a while it responds
with a list of matching <br>
articles. You can then move between those articles with the
&rsquo;Next&rsquo; and &rsquo;First&rsquo; buttons on the
search popup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILE NAME EXPANSION <br>
In most places where knews uses file names, such as the
save/pipe popup, the save/pipe action procedures, and the
newsrcFile options etc, ~ is expanded to $HOME, and the
follow&acirc; <br>
ing %&rsquo;s are expanded:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%% % <br>
%n The name of the current group. <br>
%N The name of the current group, capitalized. <br>
%g The name of the current group, slashed. <br>
%G The name of the current group, capitalized and slashed.
<br>
%s The name of the nntp server. <br>
%p The number of the port the server listens to. <br>
%a The number of the currently selected article.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Slashed means that the dots are
replaced with slashes. Note that if you save an entire
thread to a file continaing %a, the number will not change
with the article.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THE KILL FILE <br>
The kill file may be used to &rsquo;kill&rsquo; (mark read)
or &rsquo;hot&rsquo; (mark interesting) articles, subjects
and threads based on different criteria.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each line in the kill file
specifies an entry according to the following syntax:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(F)(S)(A)[Col] || Group regexp
|| Field expression</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(F) <br>
This is a character specifying to which header this entry
applies. Legal values are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&acute;M&rsquo; The
&rsquo;Message-ID:&rsquo; header, by far the most efficient.
<br>
&Acirc;&acute;S&rsquo; The &rsquo;Subject:&rsquo; header.
<br>
&Acirc;&acute;F&rsquo; The &rsquo;From:&rsquo; header. <br>
&Acirc;&acute;X&rsquo; The &rsquo;Xref:&rsquo; header.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that &rsquo;X&rsquo; only
works if the &rsquo;Xref:&rsquo; header is included in the
overview files from the server. Also note that the
&rsquo;Re: &rsquo; prefix is not considered part of the
subject.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Entries applying to a message-id
automatically expire when the relevant article has
expired.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(S) <br>
This is a character specifying the scope of the entry, i.e.
what articles are killed/&rsquo;hotted&rsquo; when this
entry applies to an article. Legal values are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&acute;A&rsquo; This
article. <br>
&Acirc;&acute;S&rsquo; All articles with the same subject.
<br>
&Acirc;&acute;T&rsquo; The entire thread. <br>
&Acirc;&acute;t&rsquo; The subthread starting with this
article.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(A) <br>
This is a character specifying the action of the entry.
Legal values are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&acute;K&rsquo; Kill,
which means mark read. <br>
&Acirc;&acute;H&rsquo; Hot, which means mark
interesting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[col] <br>
In &rsquo;hot&rsquo; entries, this is the color used to mark
the relevant articles with.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">|| <br>
This two character sequence is used as a separator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Group regexp <br>
Only newsgroups matching this regular expression will be
affected by this entry. This field is empty in the per-group
kill files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Field expression <br>
If the header field is &rsquo;S&rsquo;, &rsquo;F&rsquo; or
&rsquo;X&rsquo;, this is a regular expression, and the entry
applies to all matching articles. If the header field is
&rsquo;M&rsquo;, this is a message id; <br>
this id is probably the fastest type of kill entry, since it
can be checked with a single hash lookup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To see what articles were
killed: when you have read all unread articles, or marked
them read, use the &rsquo;mark unread, killed&rsquo; feature
on the misc menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a kill rule is applied, hot
articles are not killed. Since the entries in the kill file
are processed in order, it is possible to put kills at the
beginning, so that the <br>
articles are killed before they have a chance to become
hot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is one global kill file
(~/.knews/.kill-%s by default) and one kill file per group
(~/.knews/%s/%g/KILL by default). The rules in the global
kill file are applied before <br>
the per-group kill file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MIME VIEWERS AND MAILCAP FILES
<br>
Knews has internal support for content-types text/plain,
message/rfc822, message/partial, multipart/mixed and
multipart/digest. For other types, knews will look for a
mailcap <br>
entry for that type (see mailcap(5)). If one is found, a
clickable line will be inserted in the article text window
that is used to start the viewer. If there is no viewer,
<br>
then if the type is a subtype of text, knews will display
it, if it is a subtype of multipart, knews will treat it as
multipart/mixed, and otherwise knews will give the user <br>
opportunity to &rsquo;Save or Pipe&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mailcap files are found via the
environment variable MAILCAPS, which is a colon separated
list of path names. If this variable is not set, a default
list of</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">$HOME/.mailcap:/etc/mailcap:/usr/etc/mailcap:/usr/local/etc/mailcap</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will be used. Note that all
files found will be merged to produce the mailcap
database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As a hack around miss/over
designed mailcap files, knews will ignore entries for
text/plain and multipart/mixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TEXT/PLAIN ARTICLES <br>
The following resources determine how knews will display an
article of type text/plain with a particular charset:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Knews.charset.headerFont <br>
Knews.charset.bodyFont <br>
Knews.charset.quoteFont <br>
Knews.charset.listFont <br>
Knews.charset.treeFont <br>
Knews.charset.encoding <br>
Knews.charset.headEncHack</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The header, body and quote fonts
are used for displaying headers, ordinary text and quoted
text in the article window. Knews also has some support for
encoded 16-bit charsets, <br>
this is specified with the encoding resource. Legal values
for this are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">utf-7 The encoding specified for
unicode in rfc 1642. <br>
16-bit Straight 16-bit network byte order. <br>
hz-gb-2312 The encoding for chinese described in rfc 1842.
<br>
ksc-5601 Also called iso-2022-kr, described in rfc 1557.
<br>
big5 Another encoding for chinese.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that due to the authors
non-existent understanding of asian languages these
encodings have not been extensively tested. Lots of guess
work here.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For every newsgroup it is
possible to specify a default charset (see the section on
THE CONFIG FILE). The fonts for this charset will be used to
display articles without proper <br>
MIME-headers. Also, the listFont and treeFont (which may not
be encoded) will be used in the thread list and article
tree, respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When specifying an encoded
charset as defaultCharset, it may be desirable to still
assume that headers are ascii. This may be accomplished by
setting the &rsquo;headEncHack&rsquo; resource <br>
listed above, and setting the headerFont to an ascii
(superset) font.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MESSAGE/PARTIAL <br>
Unless the config option assemblePartials is False (see the
section on THE CONFIG FILE), when knews encounters an
article of type message/partial, it will be rememberered.
When <br>
all the parts have been seen, a notice will be popped up
offering to assemble the parts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is also an entry on the
misc menu that allows a number of articles to be tagged and
processed to look for message/partial articles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">POSTING MIME <br>
When you post an article containing 8 bit characters that
doesn&rsquo;t have a Content-Type header, knews will add
such a header with charset equal to the value of the
defaultCharset <br>
config option. Also, when quoting articles with
Content-Type: text/plain and charset equal to the
defaultCharset, knews will decode the article before
quoting. In both these <br>
contexts, the charset iso-8859-1 will be used if
defaultCharset is not set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">READING THE SPOOLDIR <br>
Knews supports a rather obscure mechanism for communicating
with an arbitrary program instead of an nntp server. Using
knewsd(1), this can be used for reading news (in)directly
<br>
from the spool dir, or even mail folders if they are in the
correct format. This is how it works: If the nntp server is
given as #str, where str is an arbitrary string not
con&acirc; <br>
taining white space or the characters &rsquo;/&rsquo;,
&rsquo;.&rsquo; or &rsquo;*&rsquo;, knews finds the value of
the resource Knews.#str and tries to execute that program.
The program has its standard input and <br>
output connected to knews. If you use this resource
setting:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Knews.#spool: knewsd -spool
/var/spool/news -active /usr/local/news/active</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">with the appropriate paths for
your system, you can read the spool directory by specifying
the nntp server as &rsquo;#spool&rsquo; in e.g. the connect
dialogue. This could easily be used to <br>
read mh(1) style mail folders too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">X RESOURCES <br>
There are a number of X resources that affect the behaviour
and appearance of knews. Most widgets in the widget
hierarchy has resources named background , foreground ,
shad&acirc; <br>
owWidth , and so on. For more information see the
application defaults file Knews.ad included in the
distribution. To get a feeling for resources, try
editres(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Knews contains a small xpm-file
to pixmap converter, so it is possible to use settings like
e.g.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Knews*backgroundPixmap:
~/pixmaps/texture.xpm</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Knews.nntpServer <br>
If this resource is set, knews automatically connects to
this nntp server on startup. This overrides the NNTPSERVER
environment variable. If the server listens to a non- <br>
standard port, you may specify this e.g as foo.bar:1234. If
you don&rsquo;t want knews to autoconnect, don&rsquo;t set
this or $NNTPSERVER.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Knews.editCommand <br>
This resource specifies the editor used to edit posts.
Possible values include:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Knews.editCommand: xemacs +%i %s
<br>
Knews.editCommand: emacs +%i %s <br>
Knews.editCommand: xterm -e vi +%i %s</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%s stands for the name of a
temporary file, and %i for the line where editing should
begin. The default value of this resource is a compile time
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Knews.urlCommand <br>
This command is used for clicking on URLs. %s is expanded to
the URL, and the result is passed to the shell. As a simple
security measure, URLs will not be allowed to <br>
contain quotes, parentheses, whitespace or ampersands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Knews.printCommand <br>
If this resource is set, the misc menu will have a print
option which invokes this command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Knews.needsTerminal <br>
Knews.copiousOutput <br>
These are two shell command templates that will be used for
mailcap viewers that have the needsterminal or the
copiousoutput flag set, respectively. In these, %C will be
<br>
expanded to the relevant mailcap command. An example should
explain it:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Knews.needsTerminal: exec xterm
-e /bin/sh -c &rsquo;%C&rsquo; <br>
Knews.copiousOuptut: exec xterm -e /bin/sh &rsquo;(%C) |
less&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Knews.mimeTypes <br>
This should point to a file whose contents maps filename
extensions to mime types. The syntax of this file is
examplified by the following list of compiled in types:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">image/jpeg jpg jpeg <br>
image/gif gif <br>
application/postscript ps</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is used to guess the
Content-Type of attachments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Knews.bell <br>
Setting this resource to False will turn off the bell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Knews.sortGroups <br>
If this is set to True, knews will keep newsgroups
alphabetically sorted when new groups are subscribed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Knews.separateWindows <br>
Setting this resource to True will make knews use a
different top level window for the article text widget.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Knews.stderrTimeout <br>
When knews starts a pipe or similar, it captures the
standard error output and displays it in a notice popup.
This resource is the time in milliseconds this popup should
<br>
stay up. The default is 10000. Setting this to 0 means stay
up indefinitely, and negative means no popups.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Knews.showCache <br>
If this is True, knews will show the state of the article
caches in a small popup. See the config options
cacheAheadSize and cacheTrailSize for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Knews.mailName <br>
If you have a mail address which isn&rsquo;t of the form
&rsquo;userid@domain.name&rsquo;, you can set this to the
part of the address that goes before the &rsquo;@&rsquo;,
e.g.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Knews.mailName:
FirstName.LastName</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that your userid will still
be used for the &rsquo;Sender&rsquo; header if
necessary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Knews.useIcon <br>
If this is set to True (the default), knews will use an
icon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Knews.confirmQuit <br>
Setting this to True will make knews ask for confirmation
before disconnecting or quitting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Knews.confirmCatchup <br>
If this is set to True, knews will ask for confirmation
before catching up a group.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Knews.confirmQuitGroup <br>
If this is set to &rsquo;True&rsquo;, knews will ask for
confirmation before leaving a group. If set to
&rsquo;tagged&rsquo;, knews will ask confirmation when
exiting a group if there are tagged <br>
articles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Knews.visualClass class <br>
Knews.visualDepth bits <br>
If these are set knews will use a visual of the specified
class and depth. Typical values for depth are 8 or 24. Legal
values for class are &rsquo;StaticGray)&rsquo;,
&rsquo;GrayScale&rsquo;, <br>
&rsquo;StaticColor&rsquo;, &Acirc;&acute;PseudoColor&rsquo;,
&rsquo;TrueColor&rsquo; and &rsquo;DirectColor&rsquo;. The
depth will be ignored if no class is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Knews.installCmap <br>
If this is set to True, knews will create its own
colormap.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Knews.inlineImages <br>
This boolean resource turns on/off inline images and color
allocation. Knews can show jpeg, gif and png images (if
compiled with support for this).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Knews.nCols <br>
This is the maximum number of colors knews will allocate for
inline images. The default is 137 (17 greys and a 5x5x5
color cube minus the 5 greys in that cube).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Knews.colorHack <br>
If this is set to True, knews try to allocate the same
colors as other programs have already allocated, thus
increasing the chances for color sharing. The number of
col&acirc; <br>
ors is controlled by the resource Knews.nCols.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following resources can be
used to change various color, font and geometry
settings:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Knews*grouplist.preferredLines
<br>
Knews*grouplist.preferredColumns <br>
These resources specify the number of lines and columns the
grouplist widget will start up with. The default is 14 for
lines and 84 for columns.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Knews*text.preferredLines <br>
Knews*text.preferredColumns <br>
These resources specify the number of lines and columns the
article text widget start up with. The default is 32 for
lines and 84 for columns.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Knews*ArtTree.nodeColumns <br>
The width of the nodes in the article tree in characters.
The default is 16.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Knews*rubberColor <br>
The color used for rubberbanding in one or two widgets. The
default is red.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Knews.headerColor <br>
Knews.bodyColor <br>
Knews.quoteColor <br>
The colors used for headers, ordinary text and quoted text
respectiely in the article window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Knews*innerColor <br>
Knews*innerDashed <br>
The color and line style used for the border of unread
articles in the article tree. The defaults are Red and
False.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Knews*outerColor <br>
Knews*outerDashed <br>
The color and line style used for the border of tagged
articles in the article tree. The defaults are foreground
and False.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Knews*ScrList.font <br>
The font used in the lists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Knews.defaultHotColor <br>
The color used for hot entries in the kill file when the
specified color is invalid or cannot be allocated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some miscellaneous
resources:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Knews.icaseRegexps <br>
Setting this to False will make regular expressions case
sensitive. They are case insensitive by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Knews.readActiveFile <br>
Knews.retrieveDescriptions <br>
Knews.fillNewsrcFile <br>
Knews.showNumberLines <br>
Knews.keepThreadInfo <br>
Knews.checkForNewGroups <br>
These set the default values for the corresponding
configuration options. Their main purpose is to allow
command line arguments. Read the section on the config file
for <br>
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Knews.newsrcTemplate <br>
Knews.oldNewsrcTemplate <br>
These set the default values for the configuration options
newsrcFile and oldNewsrcFile, the default values are
~/.newsrc-%s and ~/.oldnewsrc-%s. A value not containing
<br>
%s will not be accepted; if you want the traditional
~/.newsrc for a particular server, see the resource
Knews.configNntpServer below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Knews.killFileTemplate <br>
This sets the default value of the config option killFile.
The default value is ~/.knews/.kill-%s.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Knews.groupKillFileTemplate <br>
This is the template for the per-group kill file. The
default is ~/.knews/%s/%g/KILL, so that e.g. the newsgroup
news.software.readers will have ~/.knews/%s/news/soft&acirc;
<br>
ware/readers/KILL as kill file, where %s is the name of the
server, as usual.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Knews.configFile <br>
The configuration file used by knews. The default value is
~/.knews/config-%s, a value not containing %s will not be
accepted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Knews.configNntpServer <br>
Knews.configPostingAgent <br>
Setting configNntpServer will make knews Do The Right Thing
when the user first connects to this server, which means
setting the newsrc file for this server to ~/.newsrc <br>
when creating the config file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the configPostingAgent is set
this will be used for the postingAgent config option for the
configNntpServer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Knews.generatePath <br>
If this is set to True, knews will generate a Path header
for articles. The header will be &rsquo;Path: d!u&rsquo;
where d and u are such that the From header generated by
knews <br>
would be &rsquo;From: u@d&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Knews.autoSubscribe <br>
The value of this resource will be used when creating a new
newsrc file. If it starts with a &rsquo;/&rsquo;, it is
taken as a pathname of a file whose contents will be
inserted into <br>
the new newsrc file, otherwise the literal value of this
resource will be inserted into the newsrc file. The default
value is</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">news.answers:0ews.newusers.questions:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Knews.bogusFileSystem <br>
When knews checks for new groups, it uses the atime (time of
last access) of the config file. Some filesystems (e.g. AFS)
have no concept of atime, but fakes it with <br>
mtime (time of last modification) instead. Setting this
resource to True will make knews forcibly update the mtime
of the config file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THE CONFIG FILE <br>
When knews connects to an NNTP server it reads a
configuration file that will affect its behavior. This file
is by default called ~/.knews/config-%s where %s expands to
the name <br>
of the server, but this may be changed with the
Knews.configFile resource.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The syntax of the config file is
the same as for X resource files. When knews can&rsquo;t
find the configure file, a new one will be created
containing some default settings and a few <br>
examples settings that should be sufficient to clue you in
as to how it works.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is possible to used #include
statements in the config file to include other files.
Relative pathnames are considered relative to the current
working directory, which for <br>
knews is always $HOME. ~ pathnames are not handled in
#includes (if you want that you have to hack Xlib).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following global (i.e. per
server) options exist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">newsrcFile <br>
oldNewsrcFile <br>
These specify the newsrc file and oldnewsrc file for this
server. ~ pathnames and the same % expansions as for saving
are handled. If oldnewsrc is set to an empty <br>
string, no backup of the newsrc file will be created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default values for these are
the values of the resources Knews.newsrcTemplate and
Knews.oldNewsrcTemplate, whose default values are
~/.newsrc-%s and ~/.oldnewsrc-%s, <br>
respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For a way of automatically using
the standard file ~/.newsrc for a specific server, see the
resource Knews.configNntpServer above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">killFile <br>
The kill file. The default value is the value of the
resource Knews.killFileTemplate, whose default value is
~/.kill-%s.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cacheDir <br>
This directory is used for storing cached articles and
thread data for groups. The default is
~/.knews/cache-%s.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">readActiveFile <br>
Setting this to False will stop knews from reading the
active file when connecting, using the groups in the newsrc
file instead. This will speed up connection on slow <br>
lines if you don&rsquo;t have too many subscribed groups.
The default is the value of the resource
Knews.readActiveFile, whose default is True.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">retrieveDescriptions <br>
A boolean option indicating whether to retrieve newsgroup
descriptions from the server. The default is the value of
the resource Knews.retrieveDescriptions, whose default <br>
is True. Setting this to False may slightly speed up
connection time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">descriptionsFile <br>
If this is set, the given file will be used to cache group
descriptions: when retrieveDescriptions is True, knews saves
the descriptions to this file and when <br>
retrieveDescriptions is False, knews reads descriptions from
this file instead of from the server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fillNewsrcFile <br>
Setting this to True will make knews write all groups it
knows about to the newsrc file, which may be a good idea if
the option readActiveFile is set to False. The <br>
default is the value of the resource Knews.fillNewsrcFile,
whose default is False, which means only put information in
the newsrc file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tryListActive <br>
When this is True (the default) and readActiveFile is False,
knews will try the &quot;LIST ACTIVE wildmat&quot; nntp
extension. If this fails knews will complain and fall back
to <br>
the old &quot;GROUP&quot; stuff.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">checkForNewGroups <br>
This is a boolean option indicating whether to check for new
groups when connecting to this server. The default is True.
The atime (time of last access) of the config <br>
file will be used for the check.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">threadAheadGroups <br>
This is a white-space separated list of groups to be
automatically scheduled for thread ahead when connecting.
The special values &rsquo;all&rsquo; and &rsquo;All&rsquo;
may be used to designate <br>
all subscribed groups with unread articles and all
subscribed groups, respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">saveThreadInfo <br>
Setting this to True will allow &rsquo;thread ahead&rsquo;
data to be saved between sessions: knews will not remove the
files with this data when quitting, and when connecting
knews <br>
will check for these files for all subscribed groups. If
this is set, the options threadAheadGroups and
keepThreadInfo will be ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rescanTimeout <br>
This indicates the time in minutes between automatic
rescans. The default is 60 minutes, 0 means no automatic
rescans. Regardless of this, rescans will only be performed
<br>
at special points, to prevent a
&rsquo;rescan-idle-rescan&rsquo; loop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">groupNameColumns <br>
The width of the group name in the group list, default is
42.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">askHowMany <br>
Setting this to True will make knews ask at which article
the threading of a group should start. A hack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">postingAgent <br>
If this is specified, knews will use this for posting,
instead of posting via NNTP. If your server requires some
kind of authentication that only inews understands, you <br>
could set this to &rsquo;inews -h&rsquo;. Note that inews
appends the signature, so you don&rsquo;t want knews to add
one too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also see the resource
Knews.configPostingAgent above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">authInfoPass <br>
authInfoUser <br>
These are used to implement the NNTP AUTHINFO USER/PASS
protocol if required by the server. These exist mostly for
backward compatibility; authentication is usually only <br>
required when posting, and then it is better to use inews
for postingAgent, since presumably inews knows all about the
required authentication.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here is an example of some
settings that will improve things over a slow network
connection:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">readActiveFile: False <br>
retrieveDescriptions: False <br>
descriptionsFile: ~/.knews/cache-%s/descriptions <br>
fillNewsrcFile: True</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">but note that you will probably
want to read the active file and group descriptions at least
the first time you connect to a server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following resources may be
set on a per group basis; they should be prefixed with the
name of the group they apply to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">keepThreadInfo <br>
This tells knews whether to keep thread information in
memory after the group is exited. This will make reentering
the group fast. Legal values are: True, Subscribed and <br>
False. &rsquo;Subscribed&rsquo; means only do it if the
group is subscribed, and exists to allow settings such
as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*keepThreadInfo: Subscribed</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">to keep thread info for all
subscribed groups. The default value for this option is
&rsquo;Subscribed&rsquo; if the resource
Knews.keepThreadInfo is set to True and &rsquo;False&rsquo;
other&acirc; <br>
wise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cacheAheadSize <br>
cacheTrailSize <br>
These two set the sizes of the two article caches, the
defaults are 0. The &rsquo;ahead cache&rsquo; is used to
prefetch articles from the server in the background using a
second <br>
connection. The &rsquo;trail cache&rsquo; is used to keep
articles that you have already read, so that going back,
saving or uudecoding will be faster. The maximum values for
these <br>
are 32.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sortThreads <br>
This indicates how the threads should be sorted. A thread
consists of several subjects. These are sorted within the
thread according to the order they occur. Then the <br>
threads are sorted according to the setting of this option.
The legal values and their meanings are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">subject Alphabetically by the
first subject in the thread. <br>
size Number of unread articles in the thread. <br>
full-size Number of articles in the thread. <br>
hot Number of hot articles in the thread. <br>
date The date of the first unread article. <br>
average-date The average date of unread articles in the
thread. <br>
author Alphabetically by the first From: line in the thread.
<br>
none No sorting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All these values may be prefixed
with a minus sign to indicate a reversal of the order, or a
plus sign which is a no-op. The default value is none.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">expireKills <br>
Setting this to False will stop expirations from the kill
file. The default is True, which means that Message-id kills
will expire when you enter a group where the kill <br>
entry would have been applicable, but the article with that
message-id was not found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">attribution <br>
This string is used to attribute quotations when you post a
followup. The default is</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In article %m, %f writes:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where is a newline. The
following %&rsquo;s are expanded:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%% % <br>
%d The date of the quoted article in the form 01 Jan. <br>
%f The From: line of the article replied to. <br>
%i The initials of the previous poster. <br>
%I The initials of the previous poster, capitalized. <br>
%m The message-id of the article replied to. <br>
%n The current newsgroup. <br>
%r The real name of the previous poster. <br>
%s The subject of the quoted article. <br>
%t The time of the quoted article in the form 18:24:02. <br>
%w The week day of the quoted article. <br>
%y The year of the quoted article.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Thus &rsquo;%w, %d %y %t
GMT&rsquo; will give the date in standard rfc822 format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fullName <br>
This is the full name used in the &rsquo;From:&rsquo; header
in the articles you post. The default is $NAME, if set,
otherwise the gecos field from the password file, suitably
trun&acirc; <br>
cated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">headerFormat <br>
A colon and white-space separated list specifying which
headers to show in the article window, and in what order.
The default is</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">Subject:Newsgroups:Followup-To:Reply-To:
Content-Description:Date:Organization:From:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the name of the header starts
with a captial letter (From: as opposed to from:), knews
will decode rfc1522 encoded words encountered in this
header. (Those are the <br>
weird things that look like =?iso-8859-1?q?stuff_here?=.)
Encoded 16-bit charsets are not decoded in headers yet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">assemblePartials <br>
This boolean tells whether message/partial articles will be
remembered and offered for assembly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">quoteRegexp <br>
Lines in an article matching this regular expression will be
considered quoted lines, and may be marked with a different
color and font. The default is</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^[ ]*[:&gt;|]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">which matches lines beginning
with an arbitrary amount of white space (the denotes a tab,
note that won&rsquo;t actually work) followed by a &gt;, :
or | character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You will probably want to have
this expression anchored...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">defaultCharset <br>
The fonts for this charset will be used to display articles
that lack MIME-headers. If this is not set, us-ascii will be
assumed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also, rfc1522 encodings of this
charset in the From and Subject header will be decoded when
displayed in the article tree and the thread list. In this
case, iso-8859-1 is <br>
the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">showNumberLines <br>
A boolean option indicating whether to show the number of
lines in articles in the thread tree. The default is the
value of the resource Knews.showNumberLines, whose <br>
default is False.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">signatureFile <br>
The contents of this file will be used to sign the articles
you post (before editing). The default is ~/.signature.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">subjectColumns <br>
The width of the subject in the thread list, default is
56.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">quoteString <br>
quoteQuoteString <br>
These strings are used for quoting when posting a followup
article; the first one are used to quote lines that were not
quoted in the original article, and the second one <br>
is used for lines that were already quoted. What lines are
considered quoted is determined by the quoteRegexp. The
defaults are &quot;&gt; &quot; and &quot;&gt;&quot;
respectively. In these <br>
strings, %i is expanded to the initials of the previous
author and %I to the initials, capitalized.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">postedAndMailed <br>
This string will be instered into articles that are also
mailed to the previous author. The default is &quot;[posted
and mailed]&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">distribution <br>
If this is set, it will be used as the content of a
&rsquo;Distribution&rsquo; header. The default value is the
value of the environment variable DEFNEWSDIS if set,
otherwise empty.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fullHeader <br>
A boolean specifying whether to show all headers in the
article window. It also means turn off all MIME
transformations. The default is False.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">replyTo <br>
A string used to construct the &rsquo;Reply-To:&rsquo;
header in the articles you post. The default is the value of
the environment variable REPLYTO if set, otherwise
empty.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">organization <br>
A string used to construct the &rsquo;Organization:&rsquo;
header in the articles you post. The default is $NEWSORG if
set, otherwise $ORGANIZATION if set, otherwise nothing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">processXrefs <br>
If this boolean is True, as it is by default, articles that
are crossposted will be marked read in all groups when you
read them, mark them read, kill them or catch them <br>
up.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that this only applies to
subscribed groups, and will only work if the server&rsquo;s
overview file contains the Xref: headers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">extraHeaders <br>
This string is inserted into the head of all articles you
post (before editing). The default is empty. This could be
used to put in Mime headers, like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*extraHeaders: Content-Type:
text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">followupHeaders <br>
This is a combination of extraHeaders and attribution: it is
inserted in the headers of replies and followups and the
same %&rsquo;s as in attribution are expanded. An
example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*followupHeaders: X-Comment-To:
%r</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">uuDir <br>
Uudecoded files will end up in this directory. Or rather,
the forked off uudecoding process will be given this as its
current working directory. The default is ~/News.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">uuProgram <br>
This program will be used to uudecode files: it will be
given the bodies of the relevant articles on standard input.
The default is NULL, which means that knews will do <br>
its best to filter out garbage and then pipe the rest to
&rsquo;uudecode&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here is an example of how to set
different signatures for different newsgroups:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">swnet*signatureFile:
~/.signature-svensk <br>
de*signatureFile: ~/.signature-deutsch <br>
*linux*signatureFile: ~/.signature-linux</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first sets the file
~/.signature-svensk for all groups in the swnet hierarchy,
the second one sets the file ~/.signature-deutsch for the de
hierarchy, and the last one sets <br>
the file ~/.signature-linux for any group containing linux
as a component (not merely a substring). The file
~/.signature will be used for all other groups.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ACTIONS <br>
Knews defines a number of actions that can be tied to keys
and buttons via translations. For the default translations,
see the application defaults file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">do-the-right-thing() <br>
Does the right thing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kill-append(field, scope [,
color]) <br>
kill-prepend(field, scope [, color]) <br>
These action procedures append and prepend respectively
entries to the kill file for the current group according to
the currently selected article.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Valid values for the
&rsquo;field&rsquo; parameter are &quot;From&quot;,
&quot;Subject&quot; and &quot;Message-Id&quot;, and valid
values for &rsquo;scope&rsquo; are &quot;Thread&quot;,
&quot;Subthread&quot; and &quot;Subject&quot;. If the color
parame&acirc; <br>
ter is present, the entry added is a hot-entry with that
color, otherwise it is a kill-entry.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is probably a good idea to
use these with field = &quot;message-id&quot;, since
message-id kills are very efficient and expire with the
corresponding article.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">popup-kill([group]) <br>
This will popup a kill file editor for the supplied group.
If no group is given, the editor for the global kill file is
popped up.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mime-hack(content-type,
content-transfer-encoding) <br>
This action procedure reloads the current article,
pretending it had the specified Content-Type and
Content-Transfer-Encoding headers. For example
mime-hack(image/jpeg, <br>
uue) reloads the current article pretending it has
Content-Type image/jpeg and is uuencoded, thus makeing knews
display it as an inline image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default key-bindings have
the following: <br>
ctrl-J mime-hack(image/jpeg, uue) <br>
ctrl-G mime-hack(image/gif, uue) <br>
ctrl-P mime-hack(image/png, uue)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tree-up(arg) <br>
tree-down(arg) <br>
tree-left(arg) <br>
tree-right(arg) <br>
tree-down-right(arg) <br>
These move around in the thread tree. If the arg is
&rsquo;read&rsquo;, they will also read in the relevant
article, if arg is &rsquo;fake&rsquo;, they will also try to
read &rsquo;fake&rsquo; articles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list-up(arg) <br>
list-down(arg) <br>
These move up and down in the lists. If arg is given, it is
the number of steps, or if it contains a &rsquo;.&rsquo;,
the fraction of the window to move.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">enter-mode() <br>
exit-mode() <br>
These two actions moves between modes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tree-or-list-up(arg) <br>
tree-or-list-down(arg) <br>
tree-left-or-exit-mode(arg) <br>
tree-right-or-enter-mode(arg) <br>
These are combination actions. E.g. tree-or-list-up(arg)
does tree-up or list-up(1), depending on which is
relevant.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">read-article(arg) <br>
This rereads the current article. If arg is given, the
article is displayed with full header and no MIME
transformations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">view-thread(arg) <br>
This moves between the subject list and the thread tree. If
arg is &rsquo;toggle&rsquo;, it toggles, if arg is
&rsquo;yes&rsquo; it goes to the tree, and if arg is
&rsquo;no&rsquo;, it goes to the subject <br>
list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">followup(arg) <br>
reply(arg) <br>
followup-and-reply(arg) <br>
post-new() <br>
These correspond to the options on the post menu. If arg is
given as &rsquo;yes&rsquo; or &rsquo;no&rsquo;, it indicates
whether to include quoted text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">uudecode() <br>
clear-tagged() <br>
mark-read-article() <br>
mark-read-subject() <br>
mark-read-thread() <br>
mark-read-subthread() <br>
mark-read-to-current() <br>
mark-read-all() <br>
mark-read-tagged() <br>
mark-read-non-tagged() <br>

mark-unread-thread() <br>
mark-unread-subthread() <br>
mark-unread-all() <br>
mark-unread-tagged() <br>
mark-unread-killed() <br>
These perform the corresponding functions on the misc
menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pipe(command, parts [, scope])
<br>
save(filename, parts [, scope]) <br>
Pipe and save actions. The argument &rsquo;parts&rsquo; is a
combination of the characters &rsquo;f&rsquo;,
&rsquo;s&rsquo;, &rsquo;h&rsquo;, &rsquo;b&rsquo;,
&rsquo;e&rsquo;, corresponding to the &rsquo;bogus
from&rsquo;, &rsquo;bogus subject&rsquo;,
&rsquo;head&rsquo;, &rsquo;body&rsquo; <br>
and &rsquo;empty line&rsquo; options on the save popup
window. The &rsquo;scope&rsquo; parameter is optional, and
is one of &rsquo;window&rsquo;, &rsquo;article&rsquo;,
&rsquo;subject&rsquo;, &rsquo;thread&rsquo;,
&rsquo;subthread&rsquo; and &rsquo;tagged&rsquo;, <br>
corresponding to those options on the save popup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tag-thread([all]) <br>
tag-subject([all]) <br>
These tag the unread articles in a thread or subject. If
&rsquo;all&rsquo; is specified, they tag all articles in the
thread or subject.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">untag-thread() <br>
untag-subject() <br>
These untag the tagged articles in a thread or subject.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tag-hot() <br>
This action tags all unread hot articles, same as on the
misc menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">catchup() <br>
unsubscribe() <br>
subscribe() <br>
Guess what.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">change-size(pixels) <br>
Changes the size of the upper portion of the main window by
the specified number of pixels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">schedule-thread-ahead() <br>
Causes a group to be scheduled for &rsquo;thread
ahead&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">popup-find-group() <br>
Popups the &rsquo;find group&rsquo; popup, same as the
&rsquo;find group&rsquo; option on the misc menu.</p>
