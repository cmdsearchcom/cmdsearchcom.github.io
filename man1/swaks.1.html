swaks - Swiss Army Knife SMTP, the all-purpose smtp transaction tester
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
swaks' primary design goal is to be a flexible, scriptable, transaction-oriented
  SMTP test tool. It handles SMTP features and extensions such as TLS,
  authentication, and pipelining; multiple version of the SMTP protocol
  including SMTP, ESMTP, and LMTP; and multiple transport methods including
  unix-domain sockets, internet-domain sockets, and pipes to spawned processes.
  Options can be specified in environment variables, configuration files, and
  the command line allowing maximum configurability and ease of use for
  operators and scripters.

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTION_PROCESSING"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTION_PROCESSING">OPTION
  PROCESSING</a></h1>
To prevent potential confusion in this document a flag to swaks is always
  referred to as an &quot;option&quot;. If the option takes additional data,
  that additional data is referred to as an argument to the option. For example,
  &quot;--from fred@example.com&quot; might be provided to swaks on the command
  line, with &quot;--from&quot; being the option and
  &quot;fred@example.com&quot; being --from's argument.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Options can be given to swaks in three ways. They can be specified in a
  configuration file, in environment variables, and on the command line.
  Depending on the specific option and whether or not an argument is given to
  it, swaks may prompt the user for the argument.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When swaks evaluates its options, it first looks for a configuration file
  (either in a default location or specified with --config). Then it evaluates
  any options in environment variables. Finally, it evaluates command line
  options. At each round of processing, any options set earlier will be
  overridden. Additionally, any option can be prefixed with &quot;no-&quot; to
  cause swaks to forget that the variable had previously been set. This
  capability is necessary because many options treat defined-but-no-argument
  differently than not-defined.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The exact mechanism and format for using each of the types is listed below.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">CONFIGURATION FILE</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">A configuration file can be used to set commonly-used or
      abnormally verbose options. By default swaks looks in order for
      $SWAKS_HOME/.swaksrc, $HOME/.swaksrc, and $LOGDIR/.swaksrc. If one of
      those is found to exist (and --config has not been used) that file is used
      as the configuration file.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Additionally a configuration file in a non-default location can be specified
      using --config. If this is set and not given an argument swaks will not
      use any configuration file, including any default file. If --config points
      to a readable file, it is used as the configuration file, overriding any
      default that may exist. If it points to a non-readable file and error will
      be shown and swaks will exit.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    A set of &quot;portable&quot; defaults can also be created by adding options
      to the end of the swaks program file. As distributed, the last line of
      swaks should be &quot;__END__&quot;. Any lines added after __END__ will be
      treated as the contents of a configuration file. This allows a set of user
      preferences to be automatically copied from server to server in a single
      file.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If present and configuration files have not been explicitly turned off, the
      __END__ config is always read. Only one other configuration file will ever
      be used per single invocation of swaks, even if multiple configuration
      files are specified. Specifying the --config option with no argument turns
      off the processing of both the __END__ config and any actual config files.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    In a configuration file lines beginning with a hash (#) are ignored. All
      other lines are assumed to be an option to swaks, with the leading dash or
      dashes optional. Everything after a option line's first space is assumed
      to be the option's argument and is not shell processed. Therefore quoting
      is usually unneeded and will be included literally in the argument. Here
      is an example of the contents of a configuration file:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    # always use this sender, no matter server or logged in user
    --from fred@example.com
    # I prefer my test emails have a pretty from header.  Note
    # the lack of dashes on option and lack of quotes around
    # entire argument.
    h-From: &quot;Fred Example&quot; &lt;fred@example.com&gt;
    </pre>
  </dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Options can be supplied via environment variables. The
      variables are in the form $SWAKS_OPT_name, where name is the name of the
      option that would be specified on the command line. Because dashes aren't
      allowed in environment variable names in most unix-ish shells, no leading
      dashes should be used and any dashes inside the option's name should be
      replaced with underscores. The following would create the same options
      shown in the configuration file example:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    $ SWAKS_OPT_from='fred@example.com'
    $ SWAKS_OPT_h_From='&quot;Fred Example&quot; &lt;fred@example.com&gt;'
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Setting a variable to an empty value is the same as specifying it on the
      command line with no argument. For instance, setting
      SWAKS_OPT_server=&quot;&quot; would cause swaks to prompt the use for the
      server to which to connect at each invocation.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    In addition to setting the equivalent of command line options, SWAKS_HOME
      can be set to a directory containing the default .swaksrc to be used.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">COMMAND LINE OPTIONS</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The final method of supplying options to swaks is via the
      command line. The options behave in a manner consistent with most unix-ish
      command line programs. Many options have both a short and long form (for
      instance -s and --server). By convention short options are specified with
      a single dash and long options are specified with a double-dash. This is
      only a convention and either prefix will work with either type.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The following demonstrates the example shown in the configuration file and
      environment variable sections:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    $ swaks --from fred@example.com --h-From: '&quot;Fred Example&quot; &lt;fred@example.com&gt;'
    </pre>
  </dd>
</dl>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="TRANSPORTS"><a class="selflink" href="#TRANSPORTS">TRANSPORTS</a></h1>
swaks can connect to a target via unix pipes (&quot;pipes&quot;), unix domain
  sockets (&quot;unix sockets&quot;), or internet domain sockets (&quot;network
  sockets&quot;). Connecting via network sockets is the default behavior.
  Because of the singular nature of the transport used, each set of options in
  the following section is mutually exclusive. Specifying more than one of
  --server, --pipe, or --socket will result in an error. Mixing other options
  between transport types will only result in the irrelevant options being
  ignored. Below is a brief description of each type of transport and the
  options that are specific to that transport type.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">NETWORK SOCKETS</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This transport attempts to deliver a message via TCP/IP,
      the standard method for delivering SMTP. This is the default transport for

      domain (see --server below for more details).

      records for the domain of the recipient email address using the Net::DNS
      module. If Net::DNS is not available swaks will attempt to connect to
      localhost to deliver. The target port can optionally be set here.
      Supported formats for this include SERVER:PORT (supporting names and IPv4
      addresses); [SERVER]:PORT and SERVER/PORT (supporting names, IPv4 and IPv6

      mail server over STDIN/STDOUT. Any MTA designed to operate from inet/xinet
      should support this. In addition some MTAs provide testing modes that can
      be communicated with via STDIN/STDOUT. This transport can be used to
      automate that testing. For example, if you implemented DNSBL checking with
      Exim and you wanted to make sure it was working, you could run 'swaks
      --pipe &quot;exim -bh 127.0.0.2&quot;'. In an ideal world the process you
      are talking to should behave exactly like an SMTP server on stdin and
      stdout. Any debugging should be sent to stderr, which will be directed to
      your terminal. In the real world swaks can generally handle some debug on
      the child's stdout, but there are no guarantees on how much it can handle.

  is used to perform encryption when it is requested. If this module is not
  loadable swaks will either ignore the TLS request or error out, depending on
  whether the request was optional. STARTTLS is defined as an extension in the
  ESMTP protocol and will be unavailable if --protocol is set to a variation of

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="AUTHENTICATION"><a class="selflink" href="#AUTHENTICATION">AUTHENTICATION</a></h1>
swaks will attempt to authenticate to the target mail server if instructed to do
  so. This section details available authentication types, requirements, options
  and their interactions, and other fine points in authentication usage. Because
  authentication is defined as an extension in the ESMTP protocol it will be
  unavailable if --protocol is set to a variation of smtp.
<div class="Pp"></div>
All authentication methods require base64 encoding. If the MIME::Base64 perl
  module is loadable swaks attempts to use it to perform these encodings. If
  MIME::Base64 is not available swaks will use its own onboard base64 routines.
  These are slower than the MIME::Base64 routines and less reviewed, though they
  have been tested thoroughly. Using the MIME::Base64 module is encouraged.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If authentication is required (see options below for when it is and isn't
  required) and the requirements aren't met for the authentication type
  available, swaks displays an error and exits. Two ways this can happen include
  forcing swaks to use a specific authentication type that swaks can't use due
  to missing requirements, or allowing swaks to use any authentication type, but
  the server only advertises types swaks can't support. In the former case swaks
  errors out at option processing time since it knows up front it won't be able
  to authenticate. In the latter case swaks will error out at the authentication
  stage of the smtp transaction since swaks will not be aware that it will not
  be able to authenticate until that point.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Following are the supported authentication types including any individual notes
  and requirements.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The following options affect swaks' use of authentication. These options are all
  inter-related. For instance, specifying --auth-user implies --auth and
  --auth-password. Specifying --auth-optional implies --auth-user and
  --auth-password, etc.

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The primary advantage to this over the more specific options above is that
      there is no XCLIENT syntax validation here. This allows you to send
      invalid XCLIENT to the target server for testing. Additionally, at least
      one MTA (Message Systems' Momentum, formerly ecelerity) implements XCLIENT
      without advertising supported attributes. The --xclient option allows you
      to skip the &quot;supported attributes&quot; check when communicating with
      this type of MTA.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The --xclient option can be mixed freely with the --xclient-* options above.
      If &quot;--xclient-addr 192.168.0.1 --xclient 'FOO=bar NAME=wind'&quot; is
      given to swaks, &quot;XCLIENT ADDR=192.168.0.1 FOO=bar NAME=wind&quot;
      will be sent to the target server.</dd>

      accepted swaks' XCLIENT request). These options change that behavior.
      --xclient-optional tells swaks to proceed unconditionally past the XCLIENT
      stage of the SMTP transaction, regardless of whether it was successful.
      --xclient-optional-strict is similar but more granular. The strict version

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="PROXY_OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#PROXY_OPTIONS">PROXY
  OPTIONS</a></h1>
Swaks implements the Proxy protocol as defined in
  http://www.haproxy.org/download/1.5/doc/proxy-protocol.txt. Proxy allows an
  application load balancer, such as HAProxy, to be used in front of an MTA
  while still allowing the MTA access to the originating host information. Proxy
  support in swaks allows direct testing of an MTA configured to expect requests
  from a proxy, bypassing the proxy itself during testing.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Swaks makes no effort to ensure that the Proxy options used are internally
  consistant. For instance, --proxy-family (in version 1) is expected to be one
  of &quot;TCP4&quot; or &quot;TCP6&quot;. While it will likely not make sense
  to the target server, swaks makes no attempt to ensure that --proxy-source and
  --proxy-dest are in the same protocol family as --proxy-family or each other.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The --proxy option is mutually exclusive with all other --proxy-* options except
  --proxy-version.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When --proxy is not used, all of --proxy-family, --proxy-source,
  --proxy-source-port, --proxy-dest, and --proxy-dest-port are required.
  Additionally, when --proxy-version is 2, --proxy-protocol and --proxy-command
  are optional.

      par with the information provided in version 1.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Note that at the time of release, version 2 has been implemented but not

By default swaks provides a transcript of its transactions to its caller
  (STDOUT/STDERR). This transcript aims to be as faithful a representation as
  possible of the transaction though it does modify this output by adding
  informational prefixes to lines and by providing plaintext versions of TLS
  transactions
<div class="Pp"></div>
The &quot;informational prefixes&quot; are referred to as transaction hints.
  These hints are initially composed of those marking lines that are output of
  swaks itself, either informational or error messages, and those that indicate

  <dt class="It-tag">OPERATING SYSTEMS</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This program was primarily intended for use on unix-like
      operating systems, and it should work on any reasonable version thereof.
      It has been developed and tested on Solaris, Linux, and Mac OS X and is
      feature complete on all of these.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This program is known to demonstrate basic functionality on Windows using
      ActiveState's Perl. It has not been fully tested. Known to work are basic
      SMTP functionality and the LOGIN, PLAIN, and CRAM-MD5 auth types. Unknown
      is any TLS functionality and the NTLM/SPA and DIGEST-MD5 auth types.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Because this program should work anywhere Perl works, I would appreciate
      knowing about any new operating systems you've thoroughly used swaks on as
      well as any problems encountered on a new OS.</dd>

  <dt class="It-tag">MAIL SERVERS</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This program was almost exclusively developed against Exim
      mail servers. It was been used casually by the author, though not
      thoroughly tested, with Sendmail, Smail, Exchange, Oracle Collaboration
      Suite, qpsmtpd, and Communigate. Because all functionality in swaks is
      based off of known standards it should work with any fairly modern mail
      server. If a problem is found, please alert the author at the address
      below.</dd>

      closes the connection, swaks detects that the connection is closed, but

      If instead the server return a 250 code and then immediately closes the

  THE NAME</a></h1>
The name &quot;swaks&quot; is a (sort-of) acronym for &quot;SWiss Army Knife
  Smtp&quot;. It was chosen to be fairly distinct and pronounceable. While
  &quot;swaks&quot; is unique as the name of a software package, it has some
  other, non-software meanings. Please send in other uses of &quot;swak&quot; or
  &quot;swaks&quot; for inclusion.
