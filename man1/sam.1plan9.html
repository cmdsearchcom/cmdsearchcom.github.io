<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
sam, B, E, sam.save, samterm, samsave - screen editor with
structural regular expressions</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
sam [ option ... ] [ files ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sam -r machine</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sam.save</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">B file[:line] ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">E file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Sam is a multi-file editor. It modifies a local copy of an
external file. The copy is here called a file. The files are
listed in a menu available through mouse button 3 or <br>
the n command. Each file has an associated name, usually the
name of the external file from which it was read, and a
&lsquo;modified&rsquo; bit that indicates whether the
editor&rsquo;s file <br>
agrees with the external file. The external file is not read
into the editor&rsquo;s file until it first becomes the
current file&acirc;that to which editing commands
apply&acirc;whereupon its <br>
menu entry is printed. The options are</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a Autoindent. In this mode,
when a newline character is typed in the terminal interface,
samterm copies leading white space on the current line to
the new line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Do not &lsquo;download&rsquo;
the terminal part of sam. Editing will be done with the
command language only, as in ed(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r machine <br>
Run the host part remotely on the specified machine, the
terminal part locally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s path <br>
Start the host part from the specified file on the remote
host. Only meaningful with the -r option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t path <br>
Start the terminal part from the specified file. Useful for
debugging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Regular expressions <br>
Regular expressions are as in regexp(7) with the addition of
to represent newlines. A regular expression may never
contain a literal newline character. The empty regular <br>
expression stands for the last complete expression
encountered. A regular expression in sam matches the longest
leftmost substring formally matched by the expression.
Searching <br>
in the reverse direction is equivalent to searching
backwards with the catenation operations reversed in the
expression.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Addresses <br>
An address identifies a substring in a file. In the
following, &lsquo;character n&rsquo; means the null string
after the n-th character in the file, with 1 the first
character in the file. <br>
&lsquo;Line n&rsquo; means the n-th match, starting at the
beginning of the file, of the regular expression All files
always have a current substring, called dot, that is the
default <br>
address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Simple Addresses <br>
#n The empty string after character n; #0 is the beginning
of the file. <br>
n Line n; 0 is the beginning of the file. <br>
/regexp/ <br>
?regexp? <br>
The substring that matches the regular expression, found by
looking toward the end (/) or beginning (?) of the file, and
if necessary continuing the search from the other <br>
end to the starting point of the search. The matched
substring may straddle the starting point. When entering a
pattern containing a literal question mark for a backward
<br>
search, the question mark should be specified as a member of
a class.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 The string before the first
full line. This is not necessarily the null string; see +
and - below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ The null string at the end of
the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">. Dot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&rsquo; The mark in the file
(see the k command below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;regexp&quot; <br>
Preceding a simple address (default .), refers to the
address evaluated in the unique file whose menu line matches
the regular expression.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Compound Addresses <br>
In the following, a1 and a2 are addresses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a1+a2 The address a2 evaluated
starting at the end of a1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a1-a2 The address a2 evaluated
looking in the reverse direction starting at the beginning
of a1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a1,a2 The substring from the
beginning of a1 to the end of a2. If a1 is missing, 0 is
substituted. If a2 is missing, $ is substituted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a1;a2 Like a1,a2, but with a2
evaluated at the end of, and dot set to, a1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The operators + and - are high
precedence, while , and ; are low precedence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In both + and - forms, if a2 is
a line or character address with a missing number, the
number defaults to 1. If a1 is missing, is substituted. If
both a1 and a2 are present and <br>
distinguishable, + may be elided. a2 may be a regular
expression; if it is delimited by the effect of the + or -
is reversed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is an error for a compound
address to represent a malformed substring. Some useful
idioms: a1+- (a1-+) selects the line containing the end
(beginning) of a1. 0/regexp/ <br>
locates the first match of the expression in the file. (The
form 0;// sets dot unnecessarily.) ./regexp/// finds the
second following occurrence of the expression, and
.,/reg&acirc; <br>
exp/ extends dot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Commands <br>
In the following, text demarcated by slashes represents text
delimited by any printable character except alphanumerics.
Any number of trailing delimiters may be elided, with <br>
multiple elisions then representing null strings, but the
first delimiter must always be present. In any delimited
text, newline may not appear literally; may be typed for
<br>
newline; and quotes the delimiter, here Backslash is
otherwise interpreted literally, except in s commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most commands may be prefixed by
an address to indicate their range of operation. Those that
may not are marked with a below. If a command takes an
address and none is sup&acirc; <br>
plied, dot is used. The sole exception is the w command,
which defaults to 0,$. In the description,
&lsquo;range&rsquo; is used to represent whatever address is
supplied. Many commands <br>
set the value of dot as a side effect. If so, it is always
set to the &lsquo;result&rsquo; of the change: the empty
string for a deletion, the new text for an insertion, etc.
(but see the s <br>
and e commands).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Text commands <br>
a/text/ <br>
or <br>
a <br>
lines of text <br>
. Insert the text into the file after the range. Set
dot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c <br>
i Same as a, but c replaces the text, while i inserts before
the range.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">d Delete the text in the range.
Set dot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">s/regexp/text/ <br>
Substitute text for the first match to the regular
expression in the range. Set dot to the modified range. In
text the character &amp; stands for the string that matched
the <br>
expression. Backslash behaves as usual unless followed by a
digit: stands for the string that matched the subexpression
begun by the d-th left parenthesis. If s is <br>
followed immediately by a number n, as in s2/x/y/, the n-th
match in the range is substituted. If the command is
followed by a g, as in s/x/y/g, all matches in the range
<br>
are substituted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">m a1 <br>
t a1 Move (m) or copy (t) the range to after a1. Set
dot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Display commands <br>
p Print the text in the range. Set dot. <br>
= Print the line address and character address of the range.
<br>
=# Print just the character address of the range.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File commands <br>
* b file-list <br>
Set the current file to the first file named in the list
that sam also has in its menu. The list may be expressed
&lt;Plan 9 command in which case the file names are taken
<br>
as words (in the shell sense) generated by the Plan 9
command. <br>
* B file-list <br>
Same as b, except that file names not in the menu are
entered there, and all file names in the list are examined.
<br>
* n Print a menu of files. The format is: <br>
&rsquo; or blank indicating the file is modified or clean,
<br>
- or + indicating the file is unread or has been read (in
the terminal, * means more than one window is open), <br>
. or blank indicating the current file, <br>
a blank, <br>
and the file name. <br>
* D file-list <br>
Delete the named files from the menu. If no files are named,
the current file is deleted. It is an error to D a modified
file, but a subsequent D will delete such a file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">I/O Commands <br>
* e filename <br>
Replace the file by the contents of the named external file.
Set dot to the beginning of the file. <br>
r filename <br>
Replace the text in the range by the contents of the named
external file. Set dot. <br>
w filename <br>
Write the range (default 0,$) to the named external file.
<br>
* f filename <br>
Set the file name and print the resulting menu entry. <br>
If the file name is absent from any of these, the current
file name is used. e always sets the file name; r and w do
so if the file has no name. <br>
&lt; Plan 9-command <br>
Replace the range by the standard output of the Plan 9
command. <br>
&gt; Plan 9-command <br>
Send the range to the standard input of the Plan 9 command.
<br>
| Plan 9-command <br>
Send the range to the standard input, and replace it by the
standard output, of the Plan 9 command. <br>
* ! Plan 9-command <br>
Run the Plan 9 command. <br>
* cd directory <br>
Change working directory. If no directory is specified,
$home is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In any of &lt;, &gt;, | or !, if
the Plan 9 command is omitted the last Plan 9 command (of
any type) is substituted. If sam is downloaded (using the
mouse and raster display, i.e. not <br>
using option -d), ! sets standard input to /dev/null, and
otherwise unassigned output (stdout for ! and &gt;, stderr
for all) is placed in /tmp/sam.err and the first few lines
are <br>
printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Loops and Conditionals <br>
x/regexp/ command <br>
For each match of the regular expression in the range, run
the command with dot set to the match. Set dot to the last
match. If the regular expression and its slashes <br>
are omitted, is assumed. Null string matches potentially
occur before every character of the range and at the end of
the range. <br>
y/regexp/ command <br>
Like x, but run the command for each substring that lies
before, between, or after the matches that would be
generated by x. There is no default regular expression. Null
<br>
substrings potentially occur before every character in the
range. <br>
* X/regexp/ command <br>
For each file whose menu entry matches the regular
expression, make that the current file and run the command.
If the expression is omitted, the command is run in every
<br>
file. <br>
* Y/regexp/ command <br>
Same as X, but for files that do not match the regular
expression, and the expression is required. <br>
g/regexp/ command <br>
v/regexp/ command <br>
If the range contains (g) or does not contain (v) a match
for the expression, set dot to the range and run the
command. <br>
These may be nested arbitrarily deeply, but only one
instance of either X or Y may appear in a single command. An
empty command in an x or y defaults to p; an empty command
in X <br>
or Y defaults to f. g and v do not have defaults.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Miscellany <br>
k Set the current file&rsquo;s mark to the range. Does not
set dot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* q Quit. It is an error to quit
with modified files, but a second q will succeed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* u n Undo the last n (default
1) top-level commands that changed the contents or name of
the current file, and any other file whose most recent
change was simultaneous with the <br>
current file&rsquo;s change. Successive u&rsquo;s move
further back in time. The only commands for which u is
ineffective are cd, u, q, w and D. If n is negative, u
&lsquo;redoes,&rsquo; undo&acirc; <br>
ing the undo, going forwards in time again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(empty) <br>
If the range is explicit, set dot to the range. If sam is
downloaded, the resulting dot is selected on the screen;
otherwise it is printed. If no address is specified <br>
(the command is a newline) dot is extended in either
direction to line boundaries and printed. If dot is thereby
unchanged, it is set to .+1 and printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Grouping and multiple changes
<br>
Commands may be grouped by enclosing them in braces {}.
Commands within the braces must appear on separate lines (no
backslashes are required between commands). Semantically,
<br>
an opening brace is like a command: it takes an (optional)
address and sets dot for each sub-command. Commands within
the braces are executed sequentially, but changes made by
<br>
one command are not visible to other commands (see the next
paragraph). Braces may be nested arbitrarily.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a command makes a number of
changes to a file, as in x/re/c/text/, the addresses of all
changes to the file are computed in the original file. If
the changes are in <br>
sequence, they are applied to the file. Successive
insertions at the same address are catenated into a single
insertion composed of the several insertions in the order
applied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The terminal <br>
What follows refers to behavior of sam when downloaded, that
is, when operating as a display editor on a raster display.
This is the default behavior; invoking sam with the -d <br>
(no download) option provides access to the command language
only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each file may have zero or more
windows open. Each window is equivalent and is updated
simultaneously with changes in other windows on the same
file. Each window has an inde&acirc; <br>
pendent value of dot, indicated by a highlighted substring
on the display. Dot may be in a region not within the
window. There is usually a &lsquo;current window&rsquo;,
marked with a dark <br>
border, to which typed text and editing commands apply. Text
may be typed and edited as in rio(1); also the escape key
(ESC) selects (sets dot to) text typed since the last <br>
mouse button hit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The button 3 menu controls
window operations. The top of the menu provides the
following operators, each of which uses one or more rio-like
cursors to prompt for selection of a <br>
window or sweeping of a rectangle. &lsquo;Sweeping&rsquo; a
null rectangle gets a large window, disjoint from the
command window or the whole screen, depending on where the
null rectangle <br>
is.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">new Create a new, empty
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zerox Create a copy of an
existing window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">resize As in rio.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">close Delete the window. In the
last window of a file, close is equivalent to a D for the
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">write Equivalent to a w for the
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Below these operators is a list
of available files, starting with ~~sam~~, the command
window. Selecting a file from the list makes the most
recently used window on that file <br>
current, unless it is already current, in which case
selections cycle through the open windows. If no windows are
open on the file, the user is prompted to open one. Files
<br>
other than ~~sam~~ are marked with one of the characters -+*
according as zero, one, or more windows are open on the
file. A further mark appears on the file in the current
win&acirc; <br>
dow and a single quote, &rsquo;, on a file modified since
last write.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The command window, created
automatically when sam starts, is an ordinary window except
that text typed to it is interpreted as commands for the
editor rather than passive text, <br>
and text printed by editor commands appears in it. The
behavior is like rio, with an &lsquo;output point&rsquo;
that separates commands being typed from previous output.
Commands typed in <br>
the command window apply to the current open file&acirc;the
file in the most recently current window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Manipulating text <br>
Button 1 changes selection, much like rio. Pointing to a
non-current window with button 1 makes it current; within
the current window, button 1 selects text, thus setting dot.
<br>
Double-clicking selects text to the boundaries of words,
lines, quoted strings or bracketed strings, depending on the
text at the click.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Button 2 provides a menu of
editing commands:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cut Delete dot and save the
deleted text in the snarf buffer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">paste Replace the text in dot by
the contents of the snarf buffer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">snarf Save the text in dot in
the snarf buffer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">plumb Send the text in the
selection as a plumb message. If the selection is empty, the
white-space-delimited block of text is sent as a plumb
message with a click attribute <br>
defining where the selection lies (see plumb(7)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">look Search forward for the next
occurrence of the literal text in dot. If dot is the null
string, the text in the snarf buffer is used. The snarf
buffer is unaffected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;rio&gt; Exchange snarf
buffers with rio.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/regexp <br>
Search forward for the next match of the last regular
expression typed in a command. (Not in command window.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">send Send the text in dot, or
the snarf buffer if dot is the null string, as if it were
typed to the command window. Saves the sent text in the
snarf buffer. (Command window <br>
only.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">External communication <br>
Sam listens to the edit plumb port. If plumbing is not
active, on invocation sam creates a named pipe /srv/sam.user
which acts as an additional source of commands. Characters
<br>
written to the named pipe are treated as if they had been
typed in the command window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">B is a shell-level command that
causes an instance of sam running on the same terminal to
load the named files. B uses either plumbing or the named
pipe, whichever service is <br>
available. If plumbing is not enabled, the option allows a
line number to be specified for the initial position to
display in the last named file (plumbing provides a more
gen&acirc; <br>
eral mechanism for this ability).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">E is a shell-level command that
can be used as $EDITOR in a Unix environment. It runs B on
file and then does not exit until file is changed, which is
taken as a signal that <br>
file is done being edited.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Abnormal termination <br>
If sam terminates other than by a q command (by hangup,
deleting its window, etc.), modified files are saved in an
executable file, $HOME/sam.save. This program, when
executed, <br>
asks whether to write each file back to a external file. The
answer causes writing; anything else skips the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
$HOME/sam.save</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$HOME/sam.err</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/bin/samsave <br>
the program called to unpack $HOME/sam.save.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SOURCE <br>
