<p>GNUNET-DOWNLOAD(1) General Commands Manual
GNUNET-DOWNLOAD(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
gnunet-download - a command line interface for downloading
files from GNUnet</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
gnunet-download [OPTIONS] -- GNUNET_URI</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Download files from GNUnet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a LEVEL, --anonymity=LEVEL <br>
set desired level of receiver anonymity. Default is 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c FILENAME, --config=FILENAME
<br>
use config file (defaults: ~/.config/gnunet.conf)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D, --delete-incomplete <br>
causes gnunet-download to delete incomplete downloads when
aborted with CTRL-C. Note that complete files that are part
of an incomplete recursive download will not be <br>
deleted even with this option. Without this option,
terminating gnunet-download with a signal will cause
incomplete downloads to stay on disk. If gnunet-download
runs to <br>
(normal) completion finishing the download, this option has
no effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
print help page</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L LOGLEVEL, --loglevel=LOGLEVEL
<br>
Change the loglevel. Possible values for LOGLEVEL are ERROR,
WARNING, INFO and DEBUG.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --no-network <br>
Only search locally, do not forward requests to other
peers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o FILENAME, --output=FILENAME
<br>
write the file to FILENAME. Hint: when recursively
downloading a directory, append a &rsquo;/&rsquo; to the end
of the FILENAME to create a directory of that name. If no
FILENAME is <br>
specified, gnunet-download constructs a temporary ID from
the URI of the file. The final filename is constructed based
on meta-data extracted using libextractor (if <br>
available).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p DOWNLOADS,
--parallelism=DOWNLOADS <br>
set the maximum number of parallel downloads that is
allowed. More parallel downloads can, to some extent,
improve the overall time to download content. However,
paral&acirc; <br>
lel downloads also take more memory (see also option -r
which can be used to limit memory utilization) and more
sockets. This option is used to limit the number of files
<br>
that are downloaded in parallel (-r can be used to limit the
number of blocks that are concurrently requested). As a
result, the value only matters for recursive down&acirc;
<br>
loads. The default value is 32.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r REQUESTS,
--request-parallelism=REQUESTS <br>
set the maximum number of parallel requests that is allowed.
If multiple files are downloaded, gnunet-download will not
run them in parallel if this would cause the num&acirc; <br>
ber of pending requests to possibly exceed the given value.
This is useful since, for example, downloading dozens of
multi-gigabyte files in parallel could exhaust memory <br>
resources and would hardly improve performance. Note that
the limit only applies to this specific process and that
other download activities by other processes are not <br>
included in this limit. Consider raising this limit for
large recursive downloads with many large files if memory
and network bandwidth are not fully utilized and if the <br>
parallelism limit (-p option) is not reached. This option
also only matters for recursive downloads. The default value
is 4092.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R, --recursive <br>
download directories recursively (and in parallel); note
that the URI must belong to a GNUnet directory and that the
filename given must end with a &rsquo;/&rsquo; -- otherwise,
only <br>
the file corresponding to the URI will be downloaded. Note
that in addition to using &rsquo;-R&rsquo;, you must also
specify a filename ending in &rsquo;.gnd&rsquo; so that the
code realizes <br>
that the top-level file is a directory (since we have no
meta data).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --version <br>
print the version number</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --verbose <br>
print progress information</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
The GNUNET_URI is typically obtained from gnunet-search.
gnunet-fs-gtk can also be used instead of gnunet-download.
If you ever have to abort a download, you can at any time
<br>
continue it by re-issuing gnunet-download with the same
filename. In that case GNUnet will not download blocks again
that are already present. GNUnet&rsquo;s file-encoding will
ensure <br>
file integrity, even if the existing file was not downloaded
from GNUnet in the first place. Temporary information will
be appended to the target file until the download is
com&acirc; <br>
pleted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SETTING ANONYMITY LEVEL <br>
The -a option can be used to specify additional anonymity
constraints. If set to 0, GNUnet will try to download the
file as fast as possible, including using non-anonymous
meth&acirc; <br>
ods. If you set it to 1 (default), you use the standard
anonymous routing algorithm (which does not explicitly leak
your identity). However, a powerful adversary may still be
<br>
able to perform traffic analysis (statistics) to over time
infer data about your identity. You can gain better privacy
by specifying a higher level of anonymity, which increases
<br>
the amount of cover traffic your own traffic will get, at
the expense of performance. Note that your download
performance is not only determined by your own anonymity
level, but <br>
also by the anonymity level of the peers publishing the
file. So even if you download with anonymity level 0, the
peers publishing the data might be sharing with a higher
<br>
anonymity level, which in this case will determine
performance. Also, peers that cache content in the network
always use anonymity level 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option can be used to limit
requests further than that. In particular, you can require
GNUnet to receive certain amounts of traffic from other
peers before sending your <br>
queries. This way, you can gain very high levels of
anonymity - at the expense of much more traffic and much
higher latency. So set it only if you really believe you
need it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The definition of
ANONYMITY-RECEIVE is the following. 0 means no anonymity is
required. Otherwise a value of &rsquo;v&rsquo; means that 1
out of v bytes of &quot;anonymous&quot; traffic can be from
<br>
the local user, leaving &rsquo;v-1&rsquo; bytes of cover
traffic per byte on the wire. Thus, if GNUnet routes n bytes
of messages from foreign peers (using anonymous routing), it
may origi&acirc; <br>
nate n/(v-1) bytes of queries in the same time-period. The
time-period is twice the average delay that GNUnet defers
forwarded queries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is 1 and this should
be fine for most users. Also notice that if you choose very
large values, you may end up having no throughput at all,
especially if many of your <br>
fellow GNUnet-peers all do the same.</p>
