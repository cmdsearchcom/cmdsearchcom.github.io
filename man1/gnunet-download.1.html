      and more sockets. This option is used to limit the number of files that
      are downloaded in parallel (-r can be used to limit the number of blocks
      that are concurrently requested). As a result, the value only matters for
      recursive downloads. The default value is 32.

      them in parallel if this would cause the number of pending requests to
      possibly exceed the given value. This is useful since, for example,
      downloading dozens of multi-gigabyte files in parallel could exhaust
      memory resources and would hardly improve performance. Note that the limit
      only applies to this specific process and that other download activities
      by other processes are not included in this limit. Consider raising this
      limit for large recursive downloads with many large files if memory and
      network bandwidth are not fully utilized and if the parallelism limit (-p
      option) is not reached. This option also only matters for recursive
      downloads. The default value is 4092.

The GNUNET_URI is typically obtained from gnunet-search. gnunet-fs-gtk can also
  be used instead of gnunet-download. If you ever have to abort a download, you
  can at any time continue it by re-issuing gnunet-download with the same
  filename. In that case GNUnet will not download blocks again that are already
  present. GNUnet's file-encoding will ensure file integrity, even if the
  existing file was not downloaded from GNUnet in the first place. Temporary
  information will be appended to the target file until the download is
  completed.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SETTING_ANONYMITY_LEVEL"><a class="selflink" href="#SETTING_ANONYMITY_LEVEL">SETTING
  ANONYMITY LEVEL</a></h1>
The <b>-a</b> option can be used to specify additional anonymity constraints. If
  set to 0, GNUnet will try to download the file as fast as possible, including
  using non-anonymous methods. If you set it to 1 (default), you use the
  standard anonymous routing algorithm (which does not explicitly leak your
  identity). However, a powerful adversary may still be able to perform traffic
  analysis (statistics) to over time infer data about your identity. You can
  gain better privacy by specifying a higher level of anonymity, which increases
  the amount of cover traffic your own traffic will get, at the expense of
  performance. Note that your download performance is not only determined by
  your own anonymity level, but also by the anonymity level of the peers
  publishing the file. So even if you download with anonymity level 0, the peers
  publishing the data might be sharing with a higher anonymity level, which in
  this case will determine performance. Also, peers that cache content in the
  network always use anonymity level 1.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This option can be used to limit requests further than that. In particular, you
  can require GNUnet to receive certain amounts of traffic from other peers
  before sending your queries. This way, you can gain very high levels of
  anonymity - at the expense of much more traffic and much higher latency. So
  set it only if you really believe you need it.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The definition of ANONYMITY-RECEIVE is the following. 0 means no anonymity is
  required. Otherwise a value of 'v' means that 1 out of v bytes of
  &quot;anonymous&quot; traffic can be from the local user, leaving 'v-1' bytes
  of cover traffic per byte on the wire. Thus, if GNUnet routes n bytes of
  messages from foreign peers (using anonymous routing), it may originate
  n/(v-1) bytes of queries in the same time-period. The time-period is twice the
  average delay that GNUnet defers forwarded queries.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The default is 1 and this should be fine for most users. Also notice that if you
  choose very large values, you may end up having no throughput at all,
  especially if many of your fellow GNUnet-peers all do the same.
