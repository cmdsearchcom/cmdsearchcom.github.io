AUDIO_RENAME(1p)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
audio_rename - rename an audio file via information got via
MP3::Tag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
audio_rename -csR -@p &quot;@a/@l/@02n_@t&quot; .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">renames all the audio files in
this directory and its subdirectories into a 3-level
directory structure given by Artist_Name/Album/Filename,
with the basename of Filename being <br>
the 2-digit track number separated from the title by
underscore; it also transliterates cyrillic, and shortens
long names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(Due to use of &quot;-@&quot;
and double quotes, this command line should work both with
UNIXish and DOSish shells; the other examples can be
massaged likewise.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(Replacing @02n by
&quot;@{mA}@{n0}&quot; (as in the default value of
&quot;-p&quot;) may provide more intelligent semantic. See
the description of &quot;-p&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">audio_rename -KD *.wav</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Reports how it would rename the
*.wav files in this directory according to the default -p
rule, but without protectiing &quot;funny&quot; characters.
Will not do actual renaming.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">audio_rename -sc *.mp3</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Rename the *.mp3 files in this
directory according to the default -p rule, translating
cyrillic characters into Latin &quot;equivalents&quot;,
shortening the names of long components, and <br>
protecting &quot;funny&quot; characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">audio_rename -p
&rsquo;%a/%{d0}/%B&rsquo; -G &rsquo;*/*.mp3&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Assuming one-level subdirectory
structure dir/filename.ext, finds files with extension .mp3,
and &quot;sorts&quot; them into a two-level subdirectory
structure; toplevel directory is based <br>
on the &quot;artist&quot; field, the remaing level is
preserved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">audio_rename -p
&rsquo;%a/%{d0}/%B&rsquo; -R .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Likewise, but does not suppose
any particular depth of the current directory structure;
only the filename and the most internal directory name are
preserved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">audio_rename -p
&rsquo;%a/%N&rsquo; -R .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Likewise, but all directory
names (inside the current directory) are preserved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The script takes a list of files (or, with -R option,
directories) and renames the given files (or audio files in
the directories) according to the rules specified through
the <br>
command line options. File extensions are preserved (by
default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some &quot;companion&quot; files
(i.e., files with the same basename, and with an extension
from a certain list) may be renamed together with audio
files. A lot of care is taken to make <br>
the resulting file names as portable as possible: e.g.,
&quot;funny&quot; characters in file names are dumbed down
(unless requested otherwise), long filename components may
be shortened <br>
to certain limits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A care is taken so that renaming
will not overwrite existing files; however, on OSes which
allow rename() to overwrite files, race conditions can ruin
the best intentions. E.g., <br>
do not run several &quot;overlapping&quot; rename procedures
simultaneously!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Recognized options <br>
General use options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p
&quot;TARGET_FILENAME_PATTERN&quot; <br>
Target file name/basename pattern; is subject to
interpolation via &quot;MP3::Tag&quot; method
&quot;interpolate()&quot;. Default is
&quot;%{mA}%{n0}_%t&quot;; in simplest cases this uses
2-digit track <br>
number separated from the title by underscore. See
&quot;interpolate&quot; in MP3::Tag for more details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here is the explanation of the
default value: due to semantic of escapes &quot;%{mA}&quot;
and &quot;%{n0}&quot;, if &quot;TPOS&quot; frame (disk
number) is present, it is encoded as a letter, and put <br>
before the track number. If the track number has a form
&quot;N1/N2&quot; (meaning track N1 of N2), then N1 is used,
and padded by 0s to the width of N2. If &quot;N2&quot; is
not present, <br>
padding to width=2 is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, if &quot;TPOS&quot;
is 3/12, and track is &quot;14/173&quot;, then what is
prepended to the title is &quot;c014_&quot;; if there is no
&quot;TPOS&quot; frame, and track is &quot;4/8&quot;,
&quot;4_&quot; is prepended <br>
without any leading 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(If you want to modify the
semantic of &quot;%{n0}&quot;, note that it is equivalent to
&quot;%{n2:%{n0}}%{!n2:%02n}&quot;. So while %02{n0} will
ALWAYS 0-pad to at least width=2, the pattern <br>
&quot;%{n2:%{n0}}%{!n2:%03n}&quot; will 0-pad to width=3 in
the case N2 is absent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e &quot;.ext1|.ext2|...&quot;
<br>
&quot;|&quot;-separated list of associated extensions; when
renaming source.mp3 to target.mp3, the similar rename will
be done to files with the same basename, and extensions
.ext1, <br>
.ext2, etc. Defaults to &quot;.inf|.tag|.id3&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x If not present, the pattern
of -p is the basename; the extension of the initial file is
appended (as interpolated by %E). If present, the pattern of
-p is the complete file <br>
name. Behaviour with non-empty list of associated extensions
is not defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options have the
same meaning as for script &quot;mp3info2&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D &quot;Dry run&quot;: do not
rename, just report the calculated renames.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-G Arguments are glob patterns;
expand them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R Arguments are directory
names, recurse inside using option -E for choosing audio
files via their extension.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Regular expression to use
when looking for audio files per option -R. Defaults to
&quot;(?i:.mp3$)&quot;: will find files ending in .mp3
(ignoring the case). Note that this <br>
expression is put into a case-ignoring regular expression,
so if you want it to be case-sensitive, protect it as in
&quot;(?-i:REGEXPR)&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E &quot;option_letters&quot;
<br>
Controls expansion of escape characters. It should contain
the letters of the command-line options where &quot;\, 0
&quot; are interpolated. Default is none.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-@ Replace &quot;@&quot; by
&quot;%&quot; in option values. (May be useful since -p and
-P may have a lot of embedded characters &quot;%&quot;,
which may be hard to deal with on some shells, e.g., DOSISH
<br>
shells. DOSish shells recognize double quotes, so if one
wants shell-transparent examples of command lines, use -@
and double quotes.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P &quot;patterns&quot; <br>
Patterns to parse before application of the rule -p. See
mp3info2 for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C &quot;config_options&quot;
<br>
Configuration options for MP3::Tag. See mp3info2 for
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File name portability
options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Make the components of file
names short enough to fit on a CD file system. Currently
this means the restriction to 110 chars (as with
&quot;mkisofs -J --joliet-long&quot;, at least of <br>
version 2.01a32). The limit may be modified per
&quot;AUDIO_MAX_FILENAME_LEN&quot; environment variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that &quot;components&quot;
are parts separated by a literal character &quot;/&quot; in
the given pattern (not slashes coming from interpolated
strings).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Latinize file names (for
portability) assuming they are in WinCyrillic encoding.
Needs transliterate_win1251.pm (in examples/mod/Encode
directory of the distribution; put it <br>
in the subdirectory Encode of the script directory).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-K Do not convert
&quot;exotic&quot; characters to underscores (those
characters which have a low portability score, so the files
will have problem being moved between systems).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that this utility performes
very similarly to mp3info2 utility when the latter one is
used with -p option; only instead of printing the result of
interpolation of -p, it <br>
uses the result as the target file name for renaming (after
some &quot;sanitizing&quot; of the result). (However, the
defaults for &quot;-E&quot; options differ!)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please take into account that
the option -P is provided for completeness only. If one
needs really complicated parsing rules to deduce the
resulting file name, it is much safer <br>
to use mp3info2 utility to set the wanted file name into
some ID3v2 frame (such as
&quot;TXXX[wanted-target-name]&quot;), and then, after
checking for errors, use this result similarly to</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">audio_rename -p
&quot;%{TXXX[wanted-target-name]]}&quot; -R .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After rename, one can delete
this frame from the resulting files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to be absolutely
error-prone, preserve the initial file name inside the files
by doing something similar to</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mp3info2 -@F
&quot;TXXX[orig-fname]=@A&quot; -R .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">before the rename. If worst
comes to worst (but no race conditions happend, so files are
not overwritten), one should be able to restore the status
quo by running</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">audio_rename -@p &quot;@A&quot;
files_or_directories_list</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(giving -R option if
needed).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">POSSIBLE PROBLEMS <br>
With -R option, there might be situations when the scan of
subdirectories first finds a source file in some directory,
renames it, then continues the scan of other <br>
subdirectories, and will find the target file, so will try
to rename it again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In practice, I do not recall
ever encountering this situation; if the target file name
depends only on the contents of the file, and not its name,
then the second rename will be <br>
tautological, so not visible.</p>
