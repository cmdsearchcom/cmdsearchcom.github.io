audio_rename - rename an audio file via information got via MP3::Tag.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<pre>
  audio_rename -csR -@p &quot;@a/@l/@02n_@t&quot; .
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
renames all the audio files in this directory and its subdirectories into a
  3-level directory structure given by <i>Artist_Name/Album/Filename</i>, with
  the basename of <i>Filename</i> being the 2-digit track number separated from
  the title by underscore; it also transliterates cyrillic, and shortens long
  names.
<div class="Pp"></div>
(Due to use of &quot;-@&quot; and double quotes, this command line should work
  both with UNIXish and DOSish shells; the other examples can be massaged
  likewise.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
(Replacing @02n by &quot;@{mA}@{n0}&quot; (as in the default value of
  &quot;-p&quot;) may provide more intelligent semantic. See the description of
  &quot;-p&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  audio_rename -KD *.wav
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Reports how it would rename the <i>*.wav</i> files in this directory according
  to the default <b>-p</b> rule, but without protectiing &quot;funny&quot;
  characters. Will not do actual renaming.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  audio_rename -sc *.mp3
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Rename the <i>*.mp3</i> files in this directory according to the default
  <b>-p</b> rule, translating cyrillic characters into Latin
  &quot;equivalents&quot;, shortening the names of long components, and
  protecting &quot;funny&quot; characters.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  audio_rename -p '%a/%{d0}/%B' -G '*/*.mp3'
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Assuming one-level subdirectory structure <i>dir/filename.ext</i>, finds files
  with extension <i>.mp3</i>, and &quot;sorts&quot; them into a two-level
  subdirectory structure; toplevel directory is based on the &quot;artist&quot;
  field, the remaing level is preserved.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  audio_rename -p '%a/%{d0}/%B' -R .
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Likewise, but does not suppose any particular depth of the current directory
  structure; only the filename and the most internal directory name are
  preserved.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  audio_rename -p '%a/%N' -R .
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Likewise, but all directory names (inside the current directory) are preserved.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
The script takes a list of files (or, with <b>-R</b> option, directories) and
  renames the given files (or audio files in the directories) according to the
  rules specified through the command line options. File extensions are
  preserved (by default).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Some &quot;companion&quot; files (i.e., files with the same basename, and with
  an extension from a certain list) may be renamed together with audio files. A
  lot of care is taken to make the resulting file names as portable as possible:
  e.g., &quot;funny&quot; characters in file names are dumbed down (unless
  requested otherwise), long filename components may be shortened to certain
  limits.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A care is taken so that renaming will not overwrite existing files; however, on
  OSes which allow <i>rename()</i> to overwrite files, race conditions can ruin
  the best intentions. E.g., do not run several &quot;overlapping&quot; rename
  procedures simultaneously!

General use options:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-p</b> &quot;TARGET_FILENAME_PATTERN&quot;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Target file name/basename pattern; is subject to
      interpolation via &quot;MP3::Tag&quot; method &quot;interpolate()&quot;.
      Default is &quot;%{mA}%{n0}_%t&quot;; in simplest cases this uses 2-digit
      track number separated from the title by underscore. See
      &quot;interpolate&quot; in MP3::Tag for more details.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Here is the explanation of the default value: due to semantic of escapes
      &quot;%{mA}&quot; and &quot;%{n0}&quot;, if &quot;TPOS&quot; frame (disk
      number) is present, it is encoded as a letter, and put before the track
      number. If the track number has a form &quot;N1/N2&quot; (meaning track N1
      of N2), then N1 is used, and padded by 0s to the width of N2. If
      &quot;N2&quot; is not present, padding to width=2 is used.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    For example, if &quot;TPOS&quot; is 3/12, and track is &quot;14/173&quot;,
      then what is prepended to the title is &quot;c014_&quot;; if there is no
      &quot;TPOS&quot; frame, and track is &quot;4/8&quot;, &quot;4_&quot; is
      prepended without any leading 0.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    (If you want to modify the semantic of &quot;%{n0}&quot;, note that it is
      equivalent to &quot;%{n2:%{n0}}%{!n2:%02n}&quot;. So while %02{n0} will
      ALWAYS 0-pad to at least width=2, the pattern
      &quot;%{n2:%{n0}}%{!n2:%03n}&quot; will 0-pad to width=3 in the case N2 is
      absent.</dd>

Note that this utility performes very similarly to mp3info2 utility when the
  latter one is used with <b>-p</b> option; only instead of printing the result
  of interpolation of <b>-p</b>, it uses the result as the target file name for
  renaming (after some &quot;sanitizing&quot; of the result). (However, the
  defaults for &quot;-E&quot; options differ!)
<div class="Pp"></div>
Please take into account that the option <b>-P</b> is provided for completeness
  only. If one needs really complicated parsing rules to deduce the resulting
  file name, it is much safer to use mp3info2 utility to set the wanted file
  name into some ID3v2 frame (such as &quot;TXXX[wanted-target-name]&quot;), and
  then, after checking for errors, use this result similarly to
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  audio_rename -p &quot;%{TXXX[wanted-target-name]]}&quot; -R .
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
After rename, one can delete this frame from the resulting files.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you want to be absolutely error-prone, preserve the initial file name inside
  the files by doing something similar to
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  mp3info2 -@F &quot;TXXX[orig-fname]=@A&quot; -R .
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
before the rename. If worst comes to worst (but no race conditions happend, so
  files are not overwritten), one should be able to restore the status quo by
  running
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  audio_rename -@p &quot;@A&quot; files_or_directories_list
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
(giving <b>-R</b> option if needed).
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="POSSIBLE_PROBLEMS"><a class="selflink" href="#POSSIBLE_PROBLEMS">POSSIBLE
  PROBLEMS</a></h1>
With <b>-R</b> option, there might be situations when the scan of subdirectories
  first finds a source file in some directory, renames it, then continues the
  scan of other subdirectories, and will find the target file, so will try to
  rename it again.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In practice, I do not recall ever encountering this situation; if the target
  file name depends only on the contents of the file, and not its name, then the
  second rename will be tautological, so not visible.
