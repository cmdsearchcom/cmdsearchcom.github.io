<p>PMLOGMV(1) General Commands Manual PMLOGMV(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pmlogmv - move (rename) Performance Co-Pilot archive
files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pmlogmv [-NV] oldname newname</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
A Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) archive consists of multiple
files as created by pmlogger(1). pmlogmv allows all the
files of a single PCP archive to be moved or renamed as a
group <br>
in a single operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The oldname argument identifies
the target archive, and may be either the basename that is
common to all files in that archive or one of the
archive&rsquo;s files. The new archive&rsquo;s <br>
basename is newname.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -N option performs a
dry-run, checking and reporting what changes would be made
without making any changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Additional reporting verbosity
may be requested with the -V option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Because PCP archives are
important records of system activity, special care is taken
to ensure the integrity of an archive&rsquo;s files. For
recoverable problems encountered during <br>
the execution of pmlogmv, all the files associated with
oldname will be preserved, and no new files with the newname
prefix will be created. &lsquo;&lsquo;Recoverable
problems&rsquo;&rsquo; include <br>
signals that can be caught (such as SIGHUP, SIGINT, SIGQUIT
and SIGTERM), permissions issues, new files already
existing, file system full events, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The implementation of pmlogmv
uses hard links in the file system and so follows the
semantic restrictions of ln(2) which for most systems means
the directories containing both <br>
the oldname and the newname PCP archive files need to be
writeable and within the same file system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
ln(2) and pmlogger(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
All error and warning messages are intended to be easily
understood and errors produce a non-zero exit status.</p>
