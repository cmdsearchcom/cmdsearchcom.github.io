<p>JH_COMPILEFEATURES(1) Javahelper
JH_COMPILEFEATURES(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
jh_compilefeatures - Compiles eclipse features using
pde-build.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
jh_compilefeatures [debhelper&Acirc;&nbsp;options] [options]
[--pde-build-dir=dir] [feature&Acirc;&nbsp;[...]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
jh_compilefeatures is a javahelper program that handles
compiling features using pde-build. These features can be
specified either in debian/eclipse.features or via
command-line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">jh_compilefeatures uses
debhelper behind the scenes and are therefore subject to the
compat level (e.g. when parsing the eclipse.features
file).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When specifying the dependencies
for a feature, jh_compilefeatures will see if this feature
has just been compiled and will use the dependency if it is
among the results. This <br>
can be used together with debian/eclipse.features.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Dependencies are always resolved
by first checking if it is a recently built feature and if
not, then the system installed eclipse&rsquo;s dropins
folders will be checked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Currently jh_compilefeatures do
not clean up between builds, which means the dependencies
for previous builds are present for the current build.
Nevertheless, do not rely on <br>
this, as this behavior is subject to change.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: jh_compilefeatures will
not rearrange the build order for you in order to do
this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: that jh_compilefeatures
will not error out if it cannot find a missing dependency.
This is due to the underlying builder being unable to detect
this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
debian/eclipse.features <br>
List the eclipse features to compile and their dependencies.
The first item on the line is the feature to compile and the
following items are considered dependencies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A dependency can either be a
dropins folder or a previous built feature.
jh_compilefeatures will find it as long as it is installed
in the system eclipse&rsquo;s dropins folder or <br>
it has just been compiled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
--pde-build-dir=dir <br>
Specifies the directory from where pde-build is to be run.
Defauls to &quot;debian/.eclipse_build&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--feature-deps=deps <br>
A space separated list of dependencies. These dependencies
will be used to compile all features passed by command-line.
Features read from debian/eclipse.features are <br>
unaffected by this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--build-opts=args <br>
Pass args to the underlying builder. These options are
passed to all features built.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This defaults to
&quot;-DjavacTarget=1.5 -DjavacSource=1.5&quot; if not set.
This can be disabled by passing the empty string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--jvm-args=args <br>
Pass args to the JVM. These options are passed to all
features built.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--orbit-dir=dir <br>
Specifies where the Orbit dependencies can be found. This is
only needed if the orbit dir is in an unusual location.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--pde-build=cmd <br>
Use a non-standard pde-build command to compile the
features.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--pde-args=args <br>
Passes args directly to pde-build. Note, jh_compilefeatures
have specialised options for some of pde-build options and
these should be used whenever possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These options are passed to all
features built.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ignore-java-home <br>
Skip the check of JAVA_HOME. Since the underlying builder
uses ant (and therefore java), the build should ensure it
always uses the expected java implementation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use this if you (for whatever
reason) need to declare the specific java implementation
without being able to use JAVA_HOME.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: You still have to tell the
underlying builder which java to use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLE <br>
A sample debian/eclipse.features</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">org.eclipse.tm.terminal emf <br>
org.eclipse.rse.sdk</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">org.eclipse.tm.terminal depends
on &quot;emf&quot;, which is expected to be found in
eclipse&rsquo;s dropins folder. org.eclipse.rse.sdk on the
other hand has no dependencies beyond the eclipse <br>
platform.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If needed you can also specify a
previously built feature as a dependency:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">org.eclipse.some.feature <br>
org.eclipse.another.feature org.eclipse.some.feature rse</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here org.eclipse.another.feature
depends org.eclipse.some.feature, which was just built and
also rse, which is expected to be in system installed
eclipse&rsquo;s dropins.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This program is a part of
javahelper and uses debhelper as backend. There are also
tutorials in /usr/share/doc/javahelper.</p>
