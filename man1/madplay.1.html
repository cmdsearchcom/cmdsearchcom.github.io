<p>MADPLAY(1) MPEG Audio Decoder MADPLAY(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
madplay - decode and play MPEG audio stream(s)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
madplay [options] file ... <br>
madplay [options] -o [type:]path file ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
madplay is a command-line MPEG audio decoder and player
based on the MAD library (libmad).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MAD is a high-quality MPEG audio
decoder. It currently supports MPEG-1 and the MPEG-2
extension to Lower Sampling Frequencies, as well as the
so-called MPEG 2.5 format. All three <br>
audio layers (Layer I, Layer II, and Layer III a.k.a. MP3)
are fully implemented.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Among the special features of
MAD are 24-bit PCM resolution and 100% fixed-point (integer)
computation. Since MAD is implemented entirely without the
use of floating point arith&acirc; <br>
metic, it performs especially well on architectures without
an FPU.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MAD does not yet support MPEG-2
multichannel audio (although it should be backward
compatible with such streams) nor does it currently support
AAC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default madplay reads and
decodes one or more input files containing MPEG audio data
and plays them on the native audio device. If the input file
is a single dash (-), data is <br>
read from standard input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Decoded output may optionally be
redirected to a file instead of being played on the audio
device by using the -o (--output) option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For each file, madplay will also
attempt to read and display ID3 tag information. The
supported tag versions are ID3v1, ID3v1.1, ID3v2.2, ID3v2.3,
and ID3v2.4. If a tag contains <br>
relative volume adjustment information (RVA2), madplay will
use the information to adjust the master volume for output.
This behavior can be changed with the -A (--adjust-volume)
<br>
and -G (--replay-gain) options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -T (--show-tags-only)
option is used, decoding is not performed but tag
information is still displayed. When used in conjunction
with -v (--verbose), encoder as well as <br>
ID3 tags are shown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Verbosity <br>
-v or --verbose <br>
Generally show more information than the default. During
decoding, show information about the stream including
playing time, audio layer, bit rate, sampling frequency, and
<br>
stereo mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q or --quiet <br>
Generally show less information than the default. Do not
show any information during decoding except warnings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Q or --very-quiet <br>
Generally show no information except severe errors. Do not
show any information or warnings during decoding.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--display-time=mode <br>
Set the default verbose time display mode to mode, which
must be one of remaining, current, or overall. This is only
relevant with -v (--verbose). See --tty-control <br>
below for details on changing the time display mode during
playback.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Decoding <br>
--downsample <br>
Reduce the decoded sampling frequency 2:1. This also reduces
the computational overhead of the decoder.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i or --ignore-crc <br>
Ignore CRC information in the audio stream. This causes
frames with CRC errors to be decoded and played anyway. This
option is not recommended, but since some encoders <br>
have been known to generate bad CRC information, this option
is a work-around to play streams from such encoders.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ancillary-output=path <br>
Write ancillary data from the MPEG audio stream to path. If
path is a single dash (-), the data will be written to
standard output. Bits from the ancillary data stream <br>
are packed into octets; if any bits remain, the final octet
will be padded with zero bits. See the NOTES section below
for further information about this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Audio Output <br>
-o or --output=[type:]path <br>
Direct output to path, rather than playing audio on the
native audio device. The format of the output is specified
by type which can be any of the supported output formats
<br>
(see Output Formats below.) If a format is not specified,
one will be inferred from path. If path is a single dash
(-), the output will be written to standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b or --bit-depth=depth <br>
Request an output precision of depth bits per sample. Higher
bit depths yield higher quality sound. Typical bit depths
are 8, 16, 24, and 32, however other depths may also <br>
be possible. Whether the request can be honored depends on
the capabilities of the audio device or output format. See
the NOTES section below for further details about <br>
this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R or --sample-rate=hertz <br>
Request an output sampling frequency of hertz samples per
second (Hz). The sample rate must be in the range 1000 to
65535 Hz. Whether the request can be honored depends <br>
on the capabilities of the audio device or output format. If
the effective rate is not the same as the rate of the
decoded audio, output may be resampled, possibly <br>
resulting in lower quality sound.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d or --no-dither <br>
Do not dither output PCM samples. This may result in lower
quality sound but is useful for analyzing output from the
decoder.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--fade-in[=duration] <br>
Gradually fade-in the audio from each file over duration. If
not specified, the default duration is 0:05 (five
seconds.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a or --attenuate=decibels or
--amplify=decibels <br>
Attenuate or amplify the signal by decibels (dB). The signal
is attenuated if the decibel value is negative; it is
amplified if the value is positive. The value must be <br>
in the range -175 to +18 dB. The value may be fractional,
e.g. -1.5 dB. A value of 0 dB will leave the signal
unchanged. Each step of 6 dB will approximately halve (in
<br>
the negative direction) or double (in the positive
direction) the strength of the signal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A or --adjust-volume=decibels
<br>
Adjust the relative volume for all files. This option
overrides any per-file volume adjustment settings. For
example, -A0 may be used to ignore relative volume
adjustments <br>
given by ID3 tags. Relative volume adjustments specified by
this option or by ID3 tags are used as the base volume
against which the signal is further attenuated or
ampli&acirc; <br>
fied using the -a (--attenuate, --amplify) option or
keyboard controls. This option cannot be used together with
-G (--replay-gain).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-G or --replay-gain[=profile]
<br>
Enable Replay Gain volume adjustments. Replay Gain
information contained in the decoded files (if any) is used
to make volume adjustments for output. The profile may be
<br>
one of radio (the default) or audiophile. See the NOTES
section below for further details. When Replay Gain is
enabled, a default pre-amp gain of +6 dB is also applied;
<br>
this can be changed with the -a (--attenuate, --amplify)
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Channel Selection <br>
For dual channel streams, an output channel should be
selected. If one is not selected, the first (left) channel
will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For stereo streams, making a
channel selection other than stereo will cause the output to
become monaural.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-1 or --left <br>
Output the first (left) channel only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-2 or --right <br>
Output the second (right) channel only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m or --mono <br>
Mix the left and right channels together.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S or --stereo <br>
Force stereo output, even if the stream is single or dual
channel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Playback <br>
-s or --start=time <br>
Begin playing at time, given as an offset from the beginning
of the first file (0:00:00), seeking as necessary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t or --time=duration <br>
Stop playback after the playing time of the output audio
equals duration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z or --shuffle <br>
Randomize the list of files given on the command line for
playback.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r or --repeat[=max] <br>
Play the input files max times, or indefinitely. Playback
can be stopped prematurely by giving a time limit with the
-t (--time) option. If -z (--shuffle) is also used, <br>
the files will be continuously shuffled and repeated in such
a way that the same file is not played again until at least
half of the other files have played in the <br>
interim.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--tty-control <br>
Enable keyboard controls during playback. This is the
default unless standard input is not a terminal, output is
redirected with -o (--output), or either of -q (--quiet)
<br>
or -Q (--very-quiet) is given. The keyboard controls
are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">P Pause; press any key to
resume.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">S Stop; press any key to replay
the current file from the beginning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">F Forward; advance to the next
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">B Back; replay the current file,
unless it has been playing for less than 4 seconds, in which
case replay the previous file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">T Time display; change the time
display mode. This only works with -v (--verbose). The
display mode alternates among overall playing time, current
time remaining, and <br>
current playing time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+ Increase gain; increase the
audio output gain by 0.5 dB.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Decrease gain; decrease the
audio output gain by 0.5 dB.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Q Quit; stop decoding and
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-tty-control <br>
Disable keyboard controls during playback. This is the
default when standard input is not a terminal, output is
redirected with -o (--output), or either of -q (--quiet) or
<br>
-Q (--very-quiet) is given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Miscellaneous <br>
-T or --show-tags-only <br>
Show ID3 and/or encoder tags from the input files but do not
otherwise decode or play any audio. By default only ID3 tags
are shown (if any). With -v (--verbose), all tags <br>
are shown. Encoder tags recognized by madplay include the
Xing VBR header tag and the header tag format written by
lame(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V or --version <br>
Display the effective version and build options for madplay
and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--license <br>
Display copyright, license, and warranty information and
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h or --help <br>
Display usage information and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Output Formats <br>
Other than playing on the native audio device, the following
output formats are supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cdda CD audio, 16-bit big-endian
44100 Hz stereo PCM, padded to 2352-byte block boundary
(*.cdr, *.cda)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">aiff Audio IFF, [16-bit] PCM
(*.aif, *.aiff)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wave Microsoft RIFF/WAVE,
[16-bit] PCM (*.wav)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">snd Sun/NeXT audio, 8-bit ISDN
&Icirc;&frac14;-law (*.au, *.snd)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">raw binary [16-bit] host-endian
linear PCM, stereo interleaved</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hex ASCII hexadecimal [24-bit]
linear PCM, stereo interleaved, one sample per output
line</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">esd Enlightened Sound Daemon
(EsounD) [16-bit] (give speaker host as path)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">null no output (usually for
testing or timing the decoder)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default bit depths shown in
square brackets can be changed with the -b (--bit-depth)
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that EsounD support
requires the libesd library.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Time Specifications <br>
For options which accept a time or duration argument, the
following time specifications are recognized:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hh:mm:ss.ddd <br>
Hours, minutes, seconds, and decimal fractions of a second.
This specification is flexible; hh:mm:ss, mmm:ss, :ss,
sss.ddd, .ddd, and ssss are all acceptable. The compo&acirc;
<br>
nent values are not constrained to any particular range or
number of digits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">frac/unit <br>
A length of time specified as a rational number, in seconds.
This can be used for sample-granularity, for example
32/44100 for 32 samples, assuming a 44100 Hz sample
fre&acirc; <br>
quency.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">time1+time2 <br>
A composite time made by adding two time values together.
This permits mixing the above specification forms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The resolution of any time value
cannot exceed 1/352800000 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
error: frame #: lost synchronization <br>
If encountered at the beginning of a file, this means the
file contains something other than an ID3v2 tag before the
MPEG audio data. If encountered in the middle of a <br>
file, it may mean the file is corrupt. This message is most
commonly encountered, however, at the end of a file if the
file contains an ID3v1 tag that is not aligned to an <br>
MPEG audio frame boundary. In this case, the message is
harmless and may be ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">error: frame #: bad
main_data_begin pointer <br>
This message can occur while decoding a Layer III stream
that has been cut or spliced without preserving its bit
reservoir. The affected frame cannot be properly decoded,
<br>
but will be used to help restore the bit reservoir for
following frames.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most other messages indicate a
deficiency in the input stream.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a frame cannot be properly
decoded, a concealment strategy is used as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If the previous
frame was properly decoded, it is repeated in place of the
current frame.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If the previous
frame was not properly decoded, the current frame is
muted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
Output Precision <br>
Because MAD produces samples with a precision greater than
24 bits, by default madplay will dither the samples to the
precision of the output format. This produces high quality
<br>
audio that generally sounds superior to the output of a
simple rounding algorithm. However, dithering may
unfavorably affect an analytic examination of the output,
and therefore <br>
it may be disabled by using the -d (--no-dither) option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The actual precision of output
samples can be requested with the -b (--bit-depth) option.
Whether the request can be honored depends on the
capabilities of the audio device or <br>
output format. If this option is not specified, a typical
default depth will be used (often 16) or in the case of
output to an audio device, the highest bit depth determined
to <br>
work reliably with the device will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that bit depths greater
than 24 are effectively the same as 24-bit precision samples
padded to the requested depth.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ancillary Data <br>
MPEG audio streams contain an ancillary data stream in
addition to audio data. Most often this does not contain any
useful information and may simply consist of padding bits.
<br>
The MPEG-2 extension to multichannel audio uses part of this
ancillary stream to convey multichannel information;
presently MAD does not interpret such data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For applications which have uses
for the stream, ancillary data can be extracted with the
--ancillary-output option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Replay Gain <br>
madplay optionally supports the Replay Gain proposed
standard with the -G (--replay-gain) option to make
compensating volume adjustments when playing decoded audio
from different <br>
sources. There are two Replay Gain profiles: radio strives
to make gain adjustments that give all tracks equal
loudness, while audiophile attempts to give ideal listening
loud&acirc; <br>
ness. These adjustments are relative to a reference of 83 dB
SPL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A pre-amp gain is also used in
conjunction with Replay Gain to achieve the overall desired
loudness. When Replay Gain is enabled, this pre-amp gain
defaults to +6 dB, however it <br>
can be changed with the -a (--attenuate, --amplify) option
or keyboard controls.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that when enabled, Replay
Gain overrides any relative volume adjustments specified by
ID3 tags (RVA2). Replay Gain is also incompatible with the
-A (--adjust-volume) option; <br>
any attempt to use it will be ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Replay Gain information is read
either from an ID3 tag (RGAD) or from an encoder tag written
by lame(1). If both are present, the information in the ID3
tag takes precedence. In <br>
accordance with the proposed standard, if the requested
Replay Gain profile is not available but the alternate is,
the alternate is used instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Due to an unfortunate heresy,
versions of lame(1) since 3.95.1 write Replay Gain
information using a reference of 89 dB SPL instead of the 83
dB specified in the Replay Gain pro&acirc; <br>
posed standard. To compensate, madplay automatically
subtracts 6 dB from the Replay Gain values read from such
tags.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that madplay does not yet
support hard limiting as suggested by the Replay Gain
proposed standard; nor does it automatically reduce the
pre-amp gain to avoid clipping.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFORMING TO <br>
MAD conforms to Part 3 of the ISO/IEC 11172 (MPEG-1)
international standard for decoding MPEG audio. In addition,
MAD supports the extension to Lower Sampling Frequencies
(LSF) <br>
as defined in Part 3 of ISO/IEC 13818 (MPEG-2).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The output from MAD has been
tested and found to satisfy the ISO/IEC 11172-4
computational accuracy requirements for compliance. In most
configurations, MAD is a Full Layer III <br>
ISO/IEC 11172-3 audio decoder as defined by the
standard.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ID3 tag parsing library used
by madplay conforms to the ID3v2.4.0 informal standard.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With the exception of the
clipping prevention provisions, Replay Gain support provided
by madplay is in accordance with the Replay Gain proposed
standard published on July 10, <br>
2001 by David Robinson.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
The resampling algorithm used by madplay is one of a linear
interpolation, and does not produce optimum quality
sound.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The granularity of start and
stop times (--start and --time) is not yet as fine as this
document suggests.</p>
