<p>PG_DUMP(1) PostgreSQL 9.2.18 Documentation
PG_DUMP(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pg_dump - extract a PostgreSQL database into a script file
or other archive file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pg_dump [connection-option...] [option...] [dbname]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
pg_dump is a utility for backing up a PostgreSQL database.
It makes consistent backups even if the database is being
used concurrently. pg_dump does not block other users <br>
accessing the database (readers or writers).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Dumps can be output in script or
archive file formats. Script dumps are plain-text files
containing the SQL commands required to reconstruct the
database to the state it was in <br>
at the time it was saved. To restore from such a script,
feed it to psql(1). Script files can be used to reconstruct
the database even on other machines and other architectures;
<br>
with some modifications, even on other SQL database
products.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The alternative archive file
formats must be used with pg_restore(1) to rebuild the
database. They allow pg_restore to be selective about what
is restored, or even to reorder the <br>
items prior to being restored. The archive file formats are
designed to be portable across architectures.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When used with one of the
archive file formats and combined with pg_restore, pg_dump
provides a flexible archival and transfer mechanism. pg_dump
can be used to backup an entire <br>
database, then pg_restore can be used to examine the archive
and/or select which parts of the database are to be
restored. The most flexible output file format is the
&acirc;custom&acirc; <br>
format (-Fc). It allows for selection and reordering of all
archived items, and is compressed by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">While running pg_dump, one
should examine the output for any warnings (printed on
standard error), especially in light of the limitations
listed below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The following command-line options control the content and
format of the output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dbname <br>
Specifies the name of the database to be dumped. If this is
not specified, the environment variable PGDATABASE is used.
If that is not set, the user name specified for the <br>
connection is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a, --data-only <br>
Dump only the data, not the schema (data definitions). Table
data, large objects, and sequence values are dumped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is similar to, but
for historical reasons not identical to, specifying
--section=data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b, --blobs <br>
Include large objects in the dump. This is the default
behavior except when --schema, --table, or --schema-only is
specified, so the -b switch is only useful to add large <br>
objects to selective dumps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --clean <br>
Output commands to clean (drop) database objects prior to
outputting the commands for creating them. (Restore might
generate some harmless error messages, if any objects were
<br>
not present in the destination database.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is only meaningful
for the plain-text format. For the archive formats, you can
specify the option when you call pg_restore.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C, --create <br>
Begin the output with a command to create the database
itself and reconnect to the created database. (With a script
of this form, it doesn&rsquo;t matter which database in the
<br>
destination installation you connect to before running the
script.) If --clean is also specified, the script drops and
recreates the target database before reconnecting to <br>
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is only meaningful
for the plain-text format. For the archive formats, you can
specify the option when you call pg_restore.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E encoding, --encoding=encoding
<br>
Create the dump in the specified character set encoding. By
default, the dump is created in the database encoding.
(Another way to get the same result is to set the <br>
PGCLIENTENCODING environment variable to the desired dump
encoding.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f file, --file=file <br>
Send output to the specified file. This parameter can be
omitted for file based output formats, in which case the
standard output is used. It must be given for the directory
<br>
output format however, where it specifies the target
directory instead of a file. In this case the directory is
created by pg_dump and must not exist before.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F format, --format=format <br>
Selects the format of the output. format can be one of the
following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">p, plain <br>
Output a plain-text SQL script file (the default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c, custom <br>
Output a custom-format archive suitable for input into
pg_restore. Together with the directory output format, this
is the most flexible output format in that it allows <br>
manual selection and reordering of archived items during
restore. This format is also compressed by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">d, directory <br>
Output a directory-format archive suitable for input into
pg_restore. This will create a directory with one file for
each table and blob being dumped, plus a so-called <br>
Table of Contents file describing the dumped objects in a
machine-readable format that pg_restore can read. A
directory format archive can be manipulated with standard
<br>
Unix tools; for example, files in an uncompressed archive
can be compressed with the gzip tool. This format is
compressed by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">t, tar <br>
Output a tar-format archive suitable for input into
pg_restore. The tar format is compatible with the directory
format: extracting a tar-format archive produces a valid
<br>
directory-format archive. However, the tar format does not
support compression. Also, when using tar format the
relative order of table data items cannot be changed <br>
during restore.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i, --ignore-version <br>
A deprecated option that is now ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n schema, --schema=schema <br>
Dump only schemas matching schema; this selects both the
schema itself, and all its contained objects. When this
option is not specified, all non-system schemas in the
target <br>
database will be dumped. Multiple schemas can be selected by
writing multiple -n switches. Also, the schema parameter is
interpreted as a pattern according to the same rules <br>
used by psql&rsquo;s commands (see Patterns), so multiple
schemas can also be selected by writing wildcard characters
in the pattern. When using wildcards, be careful to quote
<br>
the pattern if needed to prevent the shell from expanding
the wildcards; see EXAMPLES.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note <br>
When -n is specified, pg_dump makes no attempt to dump any
other database objects that the selected schema(s) might
depend upon. Therefore, there is no guarantee that the <br>
results of a specific-schema dump can be successfully
restored by themselves into a clean database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note <br>
Non-schema objects such as blobs are not dumped when -n is
specified. You can add blobs back to the dump with the
--blobs switch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N schema,
--exclude-schema=schema <br>
Do not dump any schemas matching the schema pattern. The
pattern is interpreted according to the same rules as for
-n. -N can be given more than once to exclude schemas <br>
matching any of several patterns.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When both -n and -N are given,
the behavior is to dump just the schemas that match at least
one -n switch but no -N switches. If -N appears without -n,
then schemas matching <br>
-N are excluded from what is otherwise a normal dump.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o, --oids <br>
Dump object identifiers (OIDs) as part of the data for every
table. Use this option if your application references the
OID columns in some way (e.g., in a foreign key <br>
constraint). Otherwise, this option should not be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O, --no-owner <br>
Do not output commands to set ownership of objects to match
the original database. By default, pg_dump issues ALTER
OWNER or SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION statements to set <br>
ownership of created database objects. These statements will
fail when the script is run unless it is started by a
superuser (or the same user that owns all of the objects in
<br>
the script). To make a script that can be restored by any
user, but will give that user ownership of all the objects,
specify -O.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is only meaningful
for the plain-text format. For the archive formats, you can
specify the option when you call pg_restore.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R, --no-reconnect <br>
This option is obsolete but still accepted for backwards
compatibility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --schema-only <br>
Dump only the object definitions (schema), not data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is the inverse of
--data-only. It is similar to, but for historical reasons
not identical to, specifying --section=pre-data
--section=post-data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(Do not confuse this with the
--schema option, which uses the word &acirc;schema&acirc; in
a different meaning.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To exclude table data for only a
subset of tables in the database, see
--exclude-table-data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S username,
--superuser=username <br>
Specify the superuser user name to use when disabling
triggers. This is only relevant if --disable-triggers is
used. (Usually, it&rsquo;s better to leave this out, and
instead <br>
start the resulting script as superuser.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t table, --table=table <br>
Dump only tables (or views or sequences or foreign tables)
matching table. Multiple tables can be selected by writing
multiple -t switches. Also, the table parameter is <br>
interpreted as a pattern according to the same rules used by
psql&rsquo;s commands (see Patterns), so multiple tables can
also be selected by writing wildcard characters in the <br>
pattern. When using wildcards, be careful to quote the
pattern if needed to prevent the shell from expanding the
wildcards; see EXAMPLES.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -n and -N switches have no
effect when -t is used, because tables selected by -t will
be dumped regardless of those switches, and non-table
objects will not be dumped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note <br>
When -t is specified, pg_dump makes no attempt to dump any
other database objects that the selected table(s) might
depend upon. Therefore, there is no guarantee that the <br>
results of a specific-table dump can be successfully
restored by themselves into a clean database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note <br>
The behavior of the -t switch is not entirely upward
compatible with pre-8.2 PostgreSQL versions. Formerly,
writing -t tab would dump all tables named tab, but now it
<br>
just dumps whichever one is visible in your default search
path. To get the old behavior you can write -t
&rsquo;*.tab&rsquo;. Also, you must write something like -t
sch.tab to <br>
select a table in a particular schema, rather than the old
locution of -n sch -t tab.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T table, --exclude-table=table
<br>
Do not dump any tables matching the table pattern. The
pattern is interpreted according to the same rules as for
-t. -T can be given more than once to exclude tables <br>
matching any of several patterns.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When both -t and -T are given,
the behavior is to dump just the tables that match at least
one -t switch but no -T switches. If -T appears without -t,
then tables matching -T <br>
are excluded from what is otherwise a normal dump.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
Specifies verbose mode. This will cause pg_dump to output
detailed object comments and start/stop times to the dump
file, and progress messages to standard error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
Print the pg_dump version and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x, --no-privileges, --no-acl
<br>
Prevent dumping of access privileges (grant/revoke
commands).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Z 0..9, --compress=0..9 <br>
Specify the compression level to use. Zero means no
compression. For the custom archive format, this specifies
compression of individual table-data segments, and the
default <br>
is to compress at a moderate level. For plain text output,
setting a nonzero compression level causes the entire output
file to be compressed, as though it had been fed <br>
through gzip; but the default is not to compress. The tar
archive format currently does not support compression at
all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--binary-upgrade <br>
This option is for use by in-place upgrade utilities. Its
use for other purposes is not recommended or supported. The
behavior of the option may change in future releases <br>
without notice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--column-inserts,
--attribute-inserts <br>
Dump data as INSERT commands with explicit column names
(INSERT INTO table (column, ...) VALUES ...). This will make
restoration very slow; it is mainly useful for making <br>
dumps that can be loaded into non-PostgreSQL databases.
However, since this option generates a separate command for
each row, an error in reloading a row causes only that row
<br>
to be lost rather than the entire table contents.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--disable-dollar-quoting <br>
This option disables the use of dollar quoting for function
bodies, and forces them to be quoted using SQL standard
string syntax.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--disable-triggers <br>
This option is only relevant when creating a data-only dump.
It instructs pg_dump to include commands to temporarily
disable triggers on the target tables while the data is <br>
reloaded. Use this if you have referential integrity checks
or other triggers on the tables that you do not want to
invoke during data reload.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Presently, the commands emitted
for --disable-triggers must be done as superuser. So, you
should also specify a superuser name with -S, or preferably
be careful to start the <br>
resulting script as a superuser.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is only meaningful
for the plain-text format. For the archive formats, you can
specify the option when you call pg_restore.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--exclude-table-data=table <br>
Do not dump data for any tables matching the table pattern.
The pattern is interpreted according to the same rules as
for -t. --exclude-table-data can be given more than <br>
once to exclude tables matching any of several patterns.
This option is useful when you need the definition of a
particular table even though you do not need the data in
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To exclude data for all tables
in the database, see --schema-only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--inserts <br>
Dump data as INSERT commands (rather than COPY). This will
make restoration very slow; it is mainly useful for making
dumps that can be loaded into non-PostgreSQL databases. <br>
However, since this option generates a separate command for
each row, an error in reloading a row causes only that row
to be lost rather than the entire table contents. Note <br>
that the restore might fail altogether if you have
rearranged column order. The --column-inserts option is safe
against column order changes, though even slower.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--lock-wait-timeout=timeout <br>
Do not wait forever to acquire shared table locks at the
beginning of the dump. Instead fail if unable to lock a
table within the specified timeout. The timeout may be <br>
specified in any of the formats accepted by SET
statement_timeout. (Allowed values vary depending on the
server version you are dumping from, but an integer number
of <br>
milliseconds is accepted by all versions since 7.3. This
option is ignored when dumping from a pre-7.3 server.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-security-labels <br>
Do not dump security labels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-tablespaces <br>
Do not output commands to select tablespaces. With this
option, all objects will be created in whichever tablespace
is the default during restore.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is only meaningful
for the plain-text format. For the archive formats, you can
specify the option when you call pg_restore.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-unlogged-table-data <br>
Do not dump the contents of unlogged tables. This option has
no effect on whether or not the table definitions (schema)
are dumped; it only suppresses dumping the table data. <br>
Data in unlogged tables is always excluded when dumping from
a standby server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--quote-all-identifiers <br>
Force quoting of all identifiers. This option is recommended
when dumping a database from a server whose PostgreSQL major
version is different from pg_dump&rsquo;s, or when the <br>
output is intended to be loaded into a server of a different
major version. By default, pg_dump quotes only identifiers
that are reserved words in its own major version. This <br>
sometimes results in compatibility issues when dealing with
servers of other versions that may have slightly different
sets of reserved words. Using --quote-all-identifiers <br>
prevents such issues, at the price of a harder-to-read dump
script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--section=sectionname <br>
Only dump the named section. The section name can be
pre-data, data, or post-data. This option can be specified
more than once to select multiple sections. The default is
to <br>
dump all sections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The data section contains actual
table data, large-object contents, and sequence values.
Post-data items include definitions of indexes, triggers,
rules, and constraints <br>
other than validated check constraints. Pre-data items
include all other data definition items.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--serializable-deferrable <br>
Use a serializable transaction for the dump, to ensure that
the snapshot used is consistent with later database states;
but do this by waiting for a point in the transaction <br>
stream at which no anomalies can be present, so that there
isn&rsquo;t a risk of the dump failing or causing other
transactions to roll back with a serialization_failure. See
<br>
Chapter 13, Concurrency Control, in the documentation for
more information about transaction isolation and concurrency
control.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is not beneficial
for a dump which is intended only for disaster recovery. It
could be useful for a dump used to load a copy of the
database for reporting or <br>
other read-only load sharing while the original database
continues to be updated. Without it the dump may reflect a
state which is not consistent with any serial execution of
<br>
the transactions eventually committed. For example, if batch
processing techniques are used, a batch may show as closed
in the dump without all of the items which are in the <br>
batch appearing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option will make no
difference if there are no read-write transactions active
when pg_dump is started. If read-write transactions are
active, the start of the dump may <br>
be delayed for an indeterminate length of time. Once
running, performance with or without the switch is the
same.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--use-set-session-authorization
<br>
Output SQL-standard SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION commands
instead of ALTER OWNER commands to determine object
ownership. This makes the dump more standards-compatible,
but <br>
depending on the history of the objects in the dump, might
not restore properly. Also, a dump using SET SESSION
AUTHORIZATION will certainly require superuser privileges to
<br>
restore correctly, whereas ALTER OWNER requires lesser
privileges.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-?, --help <br>
Show help about pg_dump command line arguments, and
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following command-line
options control the database connection parameters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h host, --host=host <br>
Specifies the host name of the machine on which the server
is running. If the value begins with a slash, it is used as
the directory for the Unix domain socket. The default <br>
is taken from the PGHOST environment variable, if set, else
a Unix domain socket connection is attempted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p port, --port=port <br>
Specifies the TCP port or local Unix domain socket file
extension on which the server is listening for connections.
Defaults to the PGPORT environment variable, if set, or a
<br>
compiled-in default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U username, --username=username
<br>
User name to connect as.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w, --no-password <br>
Never issue a password prompt. If the server requires
password authentication and a password is not available by
other means such as a .pgpass file, the connection attempt
<br>
will fail. This option can be useful in batch jobs and
scripts where no user is present to enter a password.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-W, --password <br>
Force pg_dump to prompt for a password before connecting to
a database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is never essential,
since pg_dump will automatically prompt for a password if
the server demands password authentication. However, pg_dump
will waste a connection <br>
attempt finding out that the server wants a password. In
some cases it is worth typing -W to avoid the extra
connection attempt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--role=rolename <br>
Specifies a role name to be used to create the dump. This
option causes pg_dump to issue a SET ROLErolename command
after connecting to the database. It is useful when the <br>
authenticated user (specified by -U) lacks privileges needed
by pg_dump, but can switch to a role with the required
rights. Some installations have a policy against logging
<br>
in directly as a superuser, and use of this option allows
dumps to be made without violating the policy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
PGDATABASE, PGHOST, PGOPTIONS, PGPORT, PGUSER <br>
Default connection parameters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This utility, like most other
PostgreSQL utilities, also uses the environment variables
supported by libpq (see Section 31.14, &acirc;Environment
Variables&acirc;, in the documentation).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
pg_dump internally executes SELECT statements. If you have
problems running pg_dump, make sure you are able to select
information from the database using, for example, psql(1).
<br>
Also, any default connection settings and environment
variables used by the libpq front-end library will
apply.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The database activity of pg_dump
is normally collected by the statistics collector. If this
is undesirable, you can set parameter track_counts to false
via PGOPTIONS or the ALTER <br>
USER command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
If your database cluster has any local additions to the
template1 database, be careful to restore the output of
pg_dump into a truly empty database; otherwise you are
likely to <br>
get errors due to duplicate definitions of the added
objects. To make an empty database without any local
additions, copy from template0 not template1, for
example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CREATE DATABASE foo WITH
TEMPLATE template0;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a data-only dump is chosen
and the option --disable-triggers is used, pg_dump emits
commands to disable triggers on user tables before inserting
the data, and then commands <br>
to re-enable them after the data has been inserted. If the
restore is stopped in the middle, the system catalogs might
be left in the wrong state.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The dump file produced by
pg_dump does not contain the statistics used by the
optimizer to make query planning decisions. Therefore, it is
wise to run ANALYZE after restoring <br>
from a dump file to ensure optimal performance; see Section
23.1.3, &acirc;Updating Planner Statistics&acirc;, in the
documentation and Section 23.1.6, &acirc;The Autovacuum
Daemon&acirc;, in the <br>
documentation for more information. The dump file also does
not contain any ALTER DATABASE ... SET commands; these
settings are dumped by pg_dumpall(1), along with database
users <br>
and other installation-wide settings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Because pg_dump is used to
transfer data to newer versions of PostgreSQL, the output of
pg_dump can be expected to load into PostgreSQL server
versions newer than pg_dump&rsquo;s <br>
version. pg_dump can also dump from PostgreSQL servers older
than its own version. (Currently, servers back to version
7.0 are supported.) However, pg_dump cannot dump from <br>
PostgreSQL servers newer than its own major version; it will
refuse to even try, rather than risk making an invalid dump.
Also, it is not guaranteed that pg_dump&rsquo;s output can
be <br>
loaded into a server of an older major version &acirc; not
even if the dump was taken from a server of that version.
Loading a dump file into an older server may require manual
editing <br>
of the dump file to remove syntax not understood by the
older server. Use of the --quote-all-identifiers option is
recommended in cross-version cases, as it can prevent
problems <br>
arising from varying reserved-word lists in different
PostgreSQL versions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
To dump a database called mydb into a SQL-script file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ pg_dump mydb &gt; db.sql</p>

start with east or west and end in gsm, excluding any
schemas whose names contain the word test:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ pg_dump -n
&rsquo;east*gsm&rsquo; -n &rsquo;west*gsm&rsquo; -N
&rsquo;*test*&rsquo; mydb &gt; db.sql</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The same, using regular
expression notation to consolidate the switches:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ pg_dump -n
&rsquo;(east|west)*gsm&rsquo; -N &rsquo;*test*&rsquo; mydb
&gt; db.sql</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To dump all database objects
except for tables whose names begin with ts_:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ pg_dump -T &rsquo;ts_*&rsquo;
mydb &gt; db.sql</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To specify an upper-case or
mixed-case name in -t and related switches, you need to
double-quote the name; else it will be folded to lower case
(see Patterns). But double quotes <br>
are special to the shell, so in turn they must be quoted.
Thus, to dump a single table with a mixed-case name, you
need something like</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ pg_dump -t
&rsquo;&quot;MixedCaseName&quot;&rsquo; mydb &gt;
mytab.sql</p>
