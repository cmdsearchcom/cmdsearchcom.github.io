systemd-bootchart - Boot performance graphing tool
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>systemd-bootchart</b> is a tool, usually run at system startup, that collects
  the CPU load, disk load, memory usage, as well as per-process information from
  a running system. Collected results are output as an SVG graph. Normally,
  systemd-bootchart is invoked by the kernel by passing
  <b>init=</b><b>/usr/lib/systemd/systemd-bootchart</b> on the kernel command
  line. systemd-bootchart will then fork the real init off to resume normal
  system startup, while monitoring and logging startup information in the
  background.
<div class="Pp"></div>
After collecting a certain amount of data (usually 15-30 seconds, default 20 s)
  the logging stops and a graph is generated from the logged information. This
  graph contains vital clues as to which resources are being used, in which
  order, and where possible problems exist in the startup sequence of the
  system. It is essentially a more detailed version of the <b>systemd-analyze
  plot</b> function.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Of course, bootchart can also be used at any moment in time to collect and graph
  some data for an amount of time. It is recommended to use the <b>--rel</b>
  switch in this case.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Bootchart does not require root privileges, and will happily run as a normal
  user.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Bootchart graphs are by default written time-stamped in /run/log and saved to
  the journal with <i>MESSAGE_ID=9f26aa562cf440c2b16c773d0479b518</i>. Journal
  field <i>BOOTCHART=</i> contains the bootchart in SVG format.

<b>systemd-bootchart</b> can be invoked in several different ways:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Kernel invocation</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">The kernel can invoke <b>systemd-bootchart</b>
  instead of the init process. In turn, <b>systemd-bootchart</b> will invoke
  <b>/usr/lib/systemd/systemd</b>.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Started as a standalone program</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">One can execute <b>systemd-bootchart</b> as
  normal application from the command line. In this mode it is highly
  recommended to pass the <b>-r</b> flag in order to not graph the time elapsed
  since boot and before systemd-bootchart was started, as it may result in
  extremely large graphs. The time elapsed since boot might also include any
  time that the system was suspended.</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
These options can also be set in the /etc/systemd/bootchart.conf file. See
  <b>bootchart.conf</b>(5).
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Print a short help text and exit.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-n</b>, <b>--sample </b><b></b><i>N</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Specify the number of samples, <i>N</i>, to
  record. Samples will be recorded at intervals defined with
  <b>--freq</b>.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-f</b>, <b>--freq </b><b></b><i>f</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Specify the sample log frequency, a positive
  real <i>f</i>, in Hz. Most systems can cope with values up to 25-50 without
  creating too much overhead.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-r</b>, <b>--rel</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Use relative times instead of absolute times.
  This is useful for using bootchart at post-boot time to profile an already
  booted system. Without this option the graph would become extremely large. If
  set, the horizontal axis starts at the first recorded sample instead of time
  0.0.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-F</b>, <b>--no-filter</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Disable filtering of tasks that did not
  contribute significantly to the boot. Processes that are too short-lived (only
  seen in one sample) or that do not consume any significant CPU time (less than
  0.001 s) will not be displayed in the output graph.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-C</b>, <b>--cmdline</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Display the full command line with arguments
  of processes, instead of only the process name.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-g</b>, <b>--control-group</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Display process control group</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-o</b>, <b>--output </b><b></b><i>path</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Specify the output directory for the graphs.
  By default, bootchart writes the graphs to /run/log.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-i</b>, <b>--init </b><b></b><i>path</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Use this init binary. Defaults to
  <b>/usr/lib/systemd/systemd</b>.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-p</b>, <b>--pss</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Enable logging and graphing of processes' PSS
  (Proportional Set Size) memory consumption. See filesystems/proc.txt in the
  kernel documentation for an explanation of this field.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-e</b>, <b>--entropy</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Enable logging and graphing of the kernel
  random entropy pool size.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-x</b>, <b>--scale-x </b><b></b><i>N</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Horizontal scaling factor for all variable
  graph components.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-y</b>, <b>--scale-y </b><b></b><i>N</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Vertical scaling factor for all variable graph
  components.</div>

<b>systemd-bootchart</b> generates SVG graphs. In order to render those on a
  graphical display any SVG capable viewer can be used. It should be noted that
  the SVG render engines in most browsers (including Chrome and Firefox) are
  many times faster than dedicated graphical applications like Gimp and
  Inkscape. Just point your browser at <b>file:///run/log/</b>!
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="HISTORY"><a class="selflink" href="#HISTORY">HISTORY</a></h1>
This version of bootchart was implemented from scratch, but is inspired by
  former bootchart incantations:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Original bash</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">The original bash/shell code implemented
  bootchart. This version created a compressed tarball for processing with
  external applications. This version did not graph anything, only generated
  data.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Ubuntu C Implementation</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">This version replaced the shell version with a
  fast and efficient data logger, but also did not graph the data.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Java bootchart</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">This was the original graphing application for
  charting the data, written in java.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>pybootchartgui.py</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">pybootchart created a graph from the data
  collected by either the bash or C version.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The version of bootchart you are using now combines both the data collection and
  the charting into a single application, making it more efficient and simpler.
  There are no longer any timing issues with the data collector and the grapher,
  as the graphing cannot be run until the data has been collected. Also, the
  data kept in memory is reduced to the absolute minimum needed.

systemd-bootchart does not get the model information for the hard drive unless
  the root device is specified with root=/dev/sdxY. Using UUIDs or PARTUUIDs
  will boot fine, but the hard drive model will not be added to the chart.
