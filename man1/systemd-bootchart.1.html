<p>SYSTEMD-BOOTCHART(1) systemd-bootchart
SYSTEMD-BOOTCHART(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
systemd-bootchart - Boot performance graphing tool</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
systemd-bootchart is a tool, usually run at system startup,
that collects the CPU load, disk load, memory usage, as well
as per-process information from a running system. <br>
Collected results are output as an SVG graph. Normally,
systemd-bootchart is invoked by the kernel by passing
init=/usr/lib/systemd/systemd-bootchart on the kernel
command line. <br>
systemd-bootchart will then fork the real init off to resume
normal system startup, while monitoring and logging startup
information in the background.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After collecting a certain
amount of data (usually 15-30 seconds, default 20 s) the
logging stops and a graph is generated from the logged
information. This graph contains vital <br>
clues as to which resources are being used, in which order,
and where possible problems exist in the startup sequence of
the system. It is essentially a more detailed version of
<br>
the systemd-analyze plot function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Of course, bootchart can also be
used at any moment in time to collect and graph some data
for an amount of time. It is recommended to use the --rel
switch in this case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bootchart does not require root
privileges, and will happily run as a normal user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bootchart graphs are by default
written time-stamped in /run/log and saved to the journal
with MESSAGE_ID=9f26aa562cf440c2b16c773d0479b518. Journal
field BOOTCHART= contains the <br>
bootchart in SVG format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INVOCATION <br>
systemd-bootchart can be invoked in several different
ways:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Kernel invocation <br>
The kernel can invoke systemd-bootchart instead of the init
process. In turn, systemd-bootchart will invoke
/usr/lib/systemd/systemd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Started as a standalone program
<br>
One can execute systemd-bootchart as normal application from
the command line. In this mode it is highly recommended to
pass the -r flag in order to not graph the time <br>
elapsed since boot and before systemd-bootchart was started,
as it may result in extremely large graphs. The time elapsed
since boot might also include any time that the <br>
system was suspended.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
These options can also be set in the
/etc/systemd/bootchart.conf file. See bootchart.conf(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Print a short help text and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --sample N <br>
Specify the number of samples, N, to record. Samples will be
recorded at intervals defined with --freq.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, --freq f <br>
Specify the sample log frequency, a positive real f, in Hz.
Most systems can cope with values up to 25-50 without
creating too much overhead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, --rel <br>
Use relative times instead of absolute times. This is useful
for using bootchart at post-boot time to profile an already
booted system. Without this option the graph would <br>
become extremely large. If set, the horizontal axis starts
at the first recorded sample instead of time 0.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F, --no-filter <br>
Disable filtering of tasks that did not contribute
significantly to the boot. Processes that are too
short-lived (only seen in one sample) or that do not consume
any <br>
significant CPU time (less than 0.001 s) will not be
displayed in the output graph.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C, --cmdline <br>
Display the full command line with arguments of processes,
instead of only the process name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g, --control-group <br>
Display process control group</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o, --output path <br>
Specify the output directory for the graphs. By default,
bootchart writes the graphs to /run/log.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i, --init path <br>
Use this init binary. Defaults to
/usr/lib/systemd/systemd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, --pss <br>
Enable logging and graphing of processes&rsquo; PSS
(Proportional Set Size) memory consumption. See
filesystems/proc.txt in the kernel documentation for an
explanation of this <br>
field.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e, --entropy <br>
Enable logging and graphing of the kernel random entropy
pool size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x, --scale-x N <br>
Horizontal scaling factor for all variable graph
components.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-y, --scale-y N <br>
Vertical scaling factor for all variable graph
components.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT <br>
systemd-bootchart generates SVG graphs. In order to render
those on a graphical display any SVG capable viewer can be
used. It should be noted that the SVG render engines in most
<br>
browsers (including Chrome and Firefox) are many times
faster than dedicated graphical applications like Gimp and
Inkscape. Just point your browser at file:///run/log/!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY <br>
This version of bootchart was implemented from scratch, but
is inspired by former bootchart incantations:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Original bash <br>
The original bash/shell code implemented bootchart. This
version created a compressed tarball for processing with
external applications. This version did not graph anything,
<br>
only generated data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ubuntu C Implementation <br>
This version replaced the shell version with a fast and
efficient data logger, but also did not graph the data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Java bootchart <br>
This was the original graphing application for charting the
data, written in java.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pybootchartgui.py <br>
pybootchart created a graph from the data collected by
either the bash or C version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The version of bootchart you are
using now combines both the data collection and the charting
into a single application, making it more efficient and
simpler. There are no longer <br>
any timing issues with the data collector and the grapher,
as the graphing cannot be run until the data has been
collected. Also, the data kept in memory is reduced to the
<br>
absolute minimum needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
bootchart.conf(5)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
systemd-bootchart does not get the model information for the
hard drive unless the root device is specified with
root=/dev/sdxY. Using UUIDs or PARTUUIDs will boot fine, but
the <br>
hard drive model will not be added to the chart.</p>
