<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
purge - magnifying glass into your squid cache</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
purge [-a] [-c cf] [-d l] [-(f|F) fn | -(e|E) re] [-p h[:p]]
[-P #] [-s] [-v] [-C dir [-H]] [-n]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
purge is used to have a look at what URLs are stored in
which file within your cache. The purge tool can also be
used to release objects which URLs match user specified
regular <br>
expressions. A more troublesome feature is the ability to
remove files squid does not seem to know about any
longer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is a tool for expert usage
only, use it under your own responsibility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-a a kind of &quot;i am alive&quot; flag. It can only be
activated, if your stdout is a tty. If active, it will
display a little rotating line to indicate that there is
actually <br>
something happening. You should not use this switch if you
capture your stdout in a file or if your expression list
produces many matches. The -a flag is also incom&acirc; <br>
patible with the (default) multi cache_dir mode. <br>
default: off See also: -n</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c cd this option lets you
specify the location of the squid.conf file. Purge
understands about more than one cache_dir, and does so by
parsing squid.conf. It knows about <br>
both ways of Squid-2 cache_dir specifications, and will
automatically try to use the correct one. <br>
default: /usr/local/squid/etc/squid.conf</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C cf if you want to rescue
files from your cache, you need to specify the directory
into which the files will be copied. Please note that purge
will try to establish the <br>
original server directory structure. This switch also
activates copy-out mode. Please do not use copy-out mode
with any purge mode (-P) other than 0. <br>
For instance, if you specified &quot;-C /tmp&quot;, purge
will try to recreate /tmp/www.server.1/url/path/file, and so
forth. <br>
default: off See also: -H, -P</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d l lets you specify a debug
level. Different bits are reserved for different output.
<br>
default: 0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e|-E re Specify one regular
expression to be searched for in the cache. This is useful
if there is only a handful of objects you want to check.
Please remember to escape the <br>
shell meta characters used in your regular expression. The
use of single quotes around your expression is recommended.
The capital letter version works case sensi&acirc; <br>
tive, the lower caps version does not. <br>
default: (no default)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f|-F fn if you have more than a
handful of expressions, or want to check the same set at
regular intervals, the file option might be more useful to
you. Each line in the text <br>
file will be regarded as one regular expression. Again, the
capital letter version works case sensitive, the lower caps
version does not. <br>
default: (no default)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H if in copy-out mode (see:
-C), you can specify to keep the HTTP Header in the
recreated file. <br>
default: off See also: -C</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n tell purge to process one
cache_dir after another, instead of doing things in
parallel. If you have more than one cache_dir in your
configuration purge will fork off <br>
a worker process for each cache_dir to do the checks for
optimum speed, assuming a decently designed cache. Since
parallel execution will put quite some load on the <br>
system and its controllers, it is sometimes preferred to use
less resources, though it will take longer. <br>
default: parallel mode for more than one cache_dir</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p h[:p] Some cache admins use a
different port than 3128. The purge tool will need to
connect to your cache in order to send the PURGE request
(see -P). This option lets you <br>
specify the host and port to connect to. The port is
optional. The port can be a name (check your /etc/services)
or number. It is separated from the host name portion <br>
by a single colon, no spaces allowed. <br>
default: localhost:3128</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P # If you want to do more than
just print your cache content, you will need to specify this
option. Each bit is reserved for a different action. Only
the use of the LSB <br>
is recommended, the rest should be considered
experimental.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">no bit set: just print <br>
bit#0 set: send PURGE for matches <br>
bit#1 set: unlink object file for 404 not found PURGEs <br>
bit#2 set: unlink weird object files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you use a value other than 0
or 1, you will need to slow rebuild your cache content. A
warning message will remind you of that. If you use bit#1,
all unsuccessful PURGEs will <br>
result in the object file in your cache directory to be
removed, because squid does not seem to know about it any
longer. Beware that the asyncio might try to remove it after
the <br>
purge tool, and thus complains bitterly. Bit#1 only makes
sense, if Bit#0 is also set, otherwise it has no effect
(since the HTTP status 404 is never returned).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bit#2 is reserved for strange
files which do not even contain a URL. Beware that these
files may indicate a new object squid currently intends to
swap onto disk. If the file sud&acirc; <br>
denly went away, or is removed when squid tries to fetch the
object, it will complain bitterly. You must slow rebuild
your cache, if you use this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is recommended that if you
dare to use bit#1 or bit#2, you should only grant the purge
tool access to your squid, e.g. move the HTTP and ICP
listening port of squid to a dif&acirc; <br>
ferent non-standard location during the purge. <br>
default: 0 (just print)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s If you specify this switch,
all commandline parameters will be shown after they were
parsed. <br>
default: off</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v be verbose in the things
reported about the file. See the output section below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION <br>
In order to use purge to affect a running proxy with PURGE
method, you will have to enable this feature in squid.conf.
By default, PURGE is disabled. You should watch closely for
<br>
whom you enable the PURGE ability, otherwise a total
stranger just might wipe your cache content. Lines similar
to the following will need to be added to your
squid.conf:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">acl purge method PURGE <br>
http_access allow localhost purge <br>
http_access deny purge</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Reconfigure or restart
(preferred) your squid after changing the configuration
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT <br>
In regular mode, the output of purge consists of four
columns. If the URL contains not encoded whitespaces, it may
look as if there are more columns, but the last one is the
URI. <br>
# name meaning <br>
= ======
===========================================================
<br>
1 file name of cache file eximed which matches the regular
expression. <br>
2 status return result of purge request, &quot; 0&quot; in
print mode. <br>
3 size object size including stored headers, not file size.
<br>
4 uri perceived uri</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example for non-verbose output
in print-mode:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/cache3/00/00/0000004A 0 5682
http://graphics.userfriendly.org/images/slovenia.gif</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In verbose mode, additional
columns are inserted before the uri. Time stamps are
reported using hexadecimal notation, and Squid&rsquo;s
standard for reporting &quot;no such timestamp&quot; == <br>
-1, and &quot;unparsable timestamp&quot; == -2. <br>
# name meaning <br>
= ======
===========================================================
<br>
1 file name of cache file eximed which matches the re. <br>
2 status return result of purge request, &quot; 0&quot; in
print mode &quot;-P 0&quot;. <br>
3 size object size including stored headers, not file size.
<br>
4 md5 MD5 of URI from file, or
&quot;(no_md5_data_available)&quot; string. <br>
5 ts UTC of Value of Date: header in hex notation <br>
6 lr UTC of last time the object was referenced <br>
7 ex UTC of Expires: header <br>
8 lr UTC of Last-Modified: header <br>
9 flags Value of objects flags field in hex, see:
Programmers Guide 10 refcnt number of times the object was
referenced. 11 uri STORE_META_URL uri or
&quot;strange_file&quot; Example <br>
for verbose output in print-mode: /cache1/00/00/000000B7 0

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KNOWN ISSUES <br>
Purge does not slow rebuild the cache for you.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is still relatively slow,
especially if your machine is low on memory and/or unable to
hold all OS directory cache entries in main memory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Should never be used on
&quot;busy&quot; caches with purge modes higher than 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TODO <br>
1) use the stat() result on weird files to have a look at
their ctime and mtime. If they are younger than, lets say 30
seconds, they were just created by squid and should not be
<br>
removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2) Add a query before purging
objects or removing files, and add another option to remove
nagging for the experienced user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3) The reported object size may
be off by one.</p>
