<b>purge</b> is used to have a look at what URLs are stored in which file within
  your cache. The <b>purge</b> tool can also be used to release objects which
  URLs match user specified regular expressions. A more troublesome feature is
  the ability to remove files <b>squid</b> does not seem to know about any
  longer.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This is a tool for expert usage only, use it under your own responsibility.

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-a</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">a kind of &quot;i am alive&quot; flag. It can only be
      activated, if your stdout is a tty. If active, it will display a little
      rotating line to indicate that there is actually something happening. You
      should not use this switch if you capture your stdout in a file or if your
      expression list produces many matches. The -a flag is also incompatible
      with the (default) multi cache_dir mode.
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    default: off		See also: -n</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-c cd</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">this option lets you specify the location of the squid.conf
      file. Purge understands about more than one cache_dir, and does so by
      parsing squid.conf. It knows about both ways of Squid-2 cache_dir
      specifications, and will automatically try to use the correct one.
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    default: /usr/local/squid/etc/squid.conf</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-C cf</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">if you want to rescue files from your cache, you need to
      specify the directory into which the files will be copied. Please note
      that purge will try to establish the original server directory structure.
      This switch also activates copy-out mode. Please do not use copy-out mode
      with any purge mode (-P) other than 0.
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    For instance, if you specified &quot;-C /tmp&quot;, purge will try to
      recreate /tmp/www.server.1/url/path/file, and so forth.

      recommended. The capital letter version works case sensitive, the lower

  <dd class="It-tag">tell purge to process one cache_dir after another, instead
      of doing things in parallel. If you have more than one cache_dir in your
      configuration purge will fork off a worker process for each cache_dir to
      do the checks for optimum speed, assuming a decently designed cache. Since
      parallel execution will put quite some load on the system and its
      controllers, it is sometimes preferred to use less resources,	though it
      will take longer.

<dl class="Bl-tag">

  <dd class="It-tag">Some cache admins use a different port than 3128. The purge
      tool will need to connect to your cache in order to send the PURGE request
      (see -P). This option lets you specify the host and port to connect to.
      The port is optional. The port can be a name (check your /etc/services) or
      number. It is separated from the host name portion by a single colon, no
      spaces allowed.
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    default: localhost:3128</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">

  <dd class="It-tag">If you want to do more than just print your cache content,
      you will need to specify this option. Each bit is reserved for a different
      action. Only the use of the LSB is recommended, the rest should be
      considered experimental.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"><b>no bit set:	just print</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>

<b>bit#1 set:	unlink object file for 404 not found PURGEs</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>bit#2 set:	unlink weird object files</b></div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you use a value other than 0 or 1, you will need to slow rebuild your cache
  content. A warning message will remind you of that. If you use bit#1, all
  unsuccessful PURGEs will result in the object file in your cache directory to
  be removed, because squid does not seem to know about it any longer. Beware
  that the asyncio might try to remove it after the purge tool, and thus
  complains bitterly. Bit#1 only makes sense, if Bit#0 is also set, otherwise it
  has no effect (since the HTTP status 404 is never returned).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Bit#2 is reserved for strange files which do not even contain a URL. Beware that
  these files may indicate a new object squid currently intends to swap onto
  disk. If the file suddenly went away, or is removed when squid tries to fetch
  the object, it will complain bitterly. You must slow rebuild your cache, if
  you use this option.
<div class="Pp"></div>
It is recommended that if you dare to use bit#1 or bit#2, you should only grant
  the purge tool access to your squid, e.g. move the HTTP and ICP listening port
  of squid to a different non-standard location during the purge.

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CONFIGURATION"><a class="selflink" href="#CONFIGURATION">CONFIGURATION</a></h1>
In order to use <b>purge</b> to affect a running proxy with PURGE method, you
  will have to enable this feature in squid.conf. By default, PURGE is disabled.
  You should watch closely for whom you enable the PURGE ability, otherwise a
  total stranger just might wipe your cache content. Lines similar to the
  following will need to be added to your squid.conf:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>acl purge method PURGE</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>http_access allow localhost purge</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>http_access deny purge</b></div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Reconfigure or restart (preferred) your squid after changing the configuration
  file.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OUTPUT"><a class="selflink" href="#OUTPUT">OUTPUT</a></h1>
In regular mode, the output of purge consists of four columns. If the URL
  contains not encoded whitespaces, it may look as if there are more columns,
  but the last one is the URI.
<br/>
 # name meaning
<br/>
 = ====== ===========================================================
<br/>
 1 file name of cache file eximed which matches the regular expression.
<br/>
 2 status return result of purge request, &quot; 0&quot; in print mode.
<br/>
 3 size object size including stored headers, not file size.
<br/>
 4 uri perceived uri
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Example for non-verbose output in print-mode:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
/cache3/00/00/0000004A 0 5682
  http://graphics.userfriendly.org/images/slovenia.gif
<div class="Pp"></div>
In verbose mode, additional columns are inserted before the uri. Time stamps are
  reported using hexadecimal notation, and Squid's standard for reporting
  &quot;no such timestamp&quot; == -1, and &quot;unparsable timestamp&quot; ==
  -2.
<br/>
 # name meaning

Purge does not slow rebuild the cache for you.
<div class="Pp"></div>
It is still relatively slow, especially if your machine is low on memory and/or
  unable to hold all OS directory cache entries in main memory.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Should never be used on &quot;busy&quot; caches with purge modes higher than 1.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="TODO"><a class="selflink" href="#TODO">TODO</a></h1>
1) use the stat() result on weird files to have a look at their ctime and mtime.
  If they are younger than, lets say 30 seconds, they were just created by
  <b>squid</b> and should not be removed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
2) Add a query before purging objects or removing files, and add another option
  to remove nagging for the experienced user.
<div class="Pp"></div>
3) The reported object size may be off by one.
