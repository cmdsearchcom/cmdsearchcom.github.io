This program is part of <b>Netpbm</b>(1)
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>pamfixtrunc</b> reads as much as it can of a Netpbm image that may be
  truncated (i.e. the file may not contain the last part of the image) and
  writes out a valid Netpbm image that is just missing the bottom rows of the
  original (pre-truncation) image.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The header of a Netpbm image implies how large the image must be (how many bytes
  the file must contain). If the file is actually smaller than that, a Netpbm
  program that tries to read the image fails, with an error message telling you
  that it couldn't read the whole file. The data in the file is arranged in row
  order, from top to bottom, and the most common reason for the file being
  smaller than its header says it should be is because the bottommost rows are
  simply missing. So <b>pamfixtrunc</b> assumes that is the case and generates a
  new image with just the rows that are readable. (technically, that means the
  output's header indicates a smaller number of rows and omits any partial last
  row).
<div class="Pp"></div>
The most common way for a Netpbm file to be small is that something interrupted
  the program that generated it before it was finished writing the file. For
  example, the program ran out of its own input or encountered a bug or ran out
  of space in which to write the output.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Another problem <b>pamfixtrunc</b> deals with is where the file isn't actually
  too small, but due to a system error, a byte in the middle of it cannot be
  read (think of a disk storage failure). <b>pamfixtrunc</b> reads the input
  sequentially until it can't read any further, for any reason. So it treats
  such an image as a truncated one, ignoring all data after the unreadable byte.
<div class="Pp"></div>
But be aware that an image file is sometimes too small because of a bug in the
  program that generated it, and in that case it is not simply a matter of the
  bottom of the image missing, so <b>pamfixtrunc</b> simply creates a valid
  Netpbm image containing a garbage picture.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>pamfixtrunc</b> looks at only on the first image in a multi-image stream.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you want to test an image file to see if it is corrupted by being too small,
  use <b>pamfile --allimages</b> . It fails with an error message if the file is
  too small.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you want to cut the bottom off a valid Netpbm image, use <b>pamcut</b>.
