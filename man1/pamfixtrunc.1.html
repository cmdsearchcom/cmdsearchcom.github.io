<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pamfixtrunc - repair a Netpbm image whose file is
truncated</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pamfixtrunc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[-verbose]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[netpbmfile]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This program is part of Netpbm(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pamfixtrunc reads as much as it
can of a Netpbm image that may be truncated (i.e. the file
may not contain the last part of the image) and writes out a
valid Netpbm image that is <br>
just missing the bottom rows of the original
(pre-truncation) image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The header of a Netpbm image
implies how large the image must be (how many bytes the file
must contain). If the file is actually smaller than that, a
Netpbm program that tries <br>
to read the image fails, with an error message telling you
that it couldn&rsquo;t read the whole file. The data in the
file is arranged in row order, from top to bottom, and the
most <br>
common reason for the file being smaller than its header
says it should be is because the bottommost rows are simply
missing. So pamfixtrunc assumes that is the case and
gener&acirc; <br>
ates a new image with just the rows that are readable.
(technically, that means the output&rsquo;s header indicates
a smaller number of rows and omits any partial last
row).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The most common way for a Netpbm
file to be small is that something interrupted the program
that generated it before it was finished writing the file.
For example, the program <br>
ran out of its own input or encountered a bug or ran out of
space in which to write the output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another problem pamfixtrunc
deals with is where the file isn&rsquo;t actually too small,
but due to a system error, a byte in the middle of it cannot
be read (think of a disk storage <br>
failure). pamfixtrunc reads the input sequentially until it
can&rsquo;t read any further, for any reason. So it treats
such an image as a truncated one, ignoring all data after
the <br>
unreadable byte.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">But be aware that an image file
is sometimes too small because of a bug in the program that
generated it, and in that case it is not simply a matter of
the bottom of the image <br>
missing, so pamfixtrunc simply creates a valid Netpbm image
containing a garbage picture.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pamfixtrunc looks at only on the
first image in a multi-image stream.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to test an image
file to see if it is corrupted by being too small, use
pamfile --allimages . It fails with an error message if the
file is too small.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to cut the bottom
off a valid Netpbm image, use pamcut.</p>
