This page, part of the <b>Netpbm</b>user's<b>guide</b>(1) , describes FAX
  formats in relation to Netpbm facilities.

The ITU (formerly CCITT) publishes standards for operation of fax machines (the
  idea is to provide a way to be sure that a fax machine is able to receive a
  fax sent by another). These standards incidentally specify graphics file
  formats -- a protocol for representing a visual image in sequences of bits.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The two relevant standards are called Group 3 (G3) and Group 4 (G4) (Groups 1
  and 2 are analog standards no longer in use). Virtually every fax machine in
  existence conforms at least generally to at least one of these standards.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The standard for Group 3 fax is defined in ITU Recommendation T.4. In the U.S.,
  that is implemented by EIA standards EIA-465 and EIA-466. These standards
  cover more than the file format as well, including how to transmit bits over a
  telephone line and procedures for handling document transmissions.
<div class="Pp"></div>
G3 faxes are 204 dots per inch (dpi) horizontally and 98 dpi (196 dpi
  optionally, in fine-detail mode) vertically.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The standards specify three file formats (also called coding methods and
  compression schemes -- remember the standard doesn't mention computer files;
  it talks about the format of a stream of bits travelling over a telephone
  line):
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">MH</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This compresses in one dimension: it compresses individual
      raster lines but makes no attempt to compress redundancy between lines.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    One dimensional compression is traditionally the best a fax machine could
      handle because G3 neither assumes error free transmission not retransmits
      when errors occur, and receiving fax machines traditionally could not
      afford to buffer much of a page. It's important that when there is an
      error in a raster line, its impact not spread to many lines after it.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    All Group 3 and Group 4 fax machines must be able to send and receive MH.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    MH is sometimes called 'G3,' but that is a poor name because while the Group
      3 standard does specify MH, it has always specified other formats too.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    MH is sometimes called 'T4' based on the name of the document that specifies
      it, ITU T.4. But this is a poor name because T.4 also specifies MR.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
  </dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">MR</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This compresses in two dimensions, horizontally and
      vertically.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    MR has always been part of the Group 3 standard, but is optional (a Group 3
      fax machine may or may not be able to send and receive it).
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
  </dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">MMR</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This is a more advanced format than the others. It is even
      more two-dimensional than MR. It is optional in the Group 3 standard, and
      didn't even exist in earlier versions of it. It was developed specifically
      for the Group 4 standard, but then added to an extended Group 3 standard
      as well.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    MMR is sometimes called Group 4, but that is a poor name because of the fact
      that it is also part of the current Group 3 standard.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    MMR is sometimes called 'T6' based on the name of the document
    <br/>
     that specifies it, ITU T.6.

<b>g3topbm</b> converts the MH format to PBM. <b>pbmtog3</b> converts PBM to MH.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There is no Netpbm program to convert to or from other fax formats.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="TIFF"><a class="selflink" href="#TIFF">TIFF</a></h1>
The TIFF format is flexible enough to allow lots of different coding methods,
  within it. There are TIFF subformats for MH, MR, and MMR, among others. These
  are particularly useful when you receive a fax as a TIFF file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>tifftopnm</b> recognizes and can convert from any of these.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>pamtotiff</b> can convert to any of these; you use command options to choose
  which.</div>
