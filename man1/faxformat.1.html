Formats(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
This page, part of the Netpbmuser&rsquo;sguide(1) ,
describes FAX formats in relation to Netpbm facilities.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The ITU (formerly CCITT) publishes standards for operation
of fax machines (the idea is to provide a way to be sure
that a fax machine is able to receive a fax sent by
another). <br>
These standards incidentally specify graphics file formats
-- a protocol for representing a visual image in sequences
of bits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The two relevant standards are
called Group 3 (G3) and Group 4 (G4) (Groups 1 and 2 are
analog standards no longer in use). Virtually every fax
machine in existence conforms at <br>
least generally to at least one of these standards.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The standard for Group 3 fax is
defined in ITU Recommendation T.4. In the U.S., that is
implemented by EIA standards EIA-465 and EIA-466. These
standards cover more than the <br>
file format as well, including how to transmit bits over a
telephone line and procedures for handling document
transmissions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">G3 faxes are 204 dots per inch
(dpi) horizontally and 98 dpi (196 dpi optionally, in
fine-detail mode) vertically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The standards specify three file
formats (also called coding methods and compression schemes
-- remember the standard doesn&rsquo;t mention computer
files; it talks about the format of <br>
a stream of bits travelling over a telephone line):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MH This compresses in one
dimension: it compresses individual raster lines but makes
no attempt to compress redundancy between lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One dimensional compression is
traditionally the best a fax machine could handle because G3
neither assumes error free transmission not retransmits when
errors occur, and <br>
receiving fax machines traditionally could not afford to
buffer much of a page. It&rsquo;s important that when there
is an error in a raster line, its impact not spread to many
<br>
lines after it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All Group 3 and Group 4 fax
machines must be able to send and receive MH.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MH is sometimes called
&rsquo;G3,&rsquo; but that is a poor name because while the
Group 3 standard does specify MH, it has always specified
other formats too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MH is sometimes called
&rsquo;T4&rsquo; based on the name of the document that
specifies it, ITU T.4. But this is a poor name because T.4
also specifies MR.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MR This compresses in two
dimensions, horizontally and vertically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MR has always been part of the
Group 3 standard, but is optional (a Group 3 fax machine may
or may not be able to send and receive it).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MMR This is a more advanced
format than the others. It is even more two-dimensional than
MR. It is optional in the Group 3 standard, and didn&rsquo;t
even exist in earlier ver&acirc; <br>
sions of it. It was developed specifically for the Group 4
standard, but then added to an extended Group 3 standard as
well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MMR is sometimes called Group 4,
but that is a poor name because of the fact that it is also
part of the current Group 3 standard.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MMR is sometimes called
&rsquo;T6&rsquo; based on the name of the document <br>
that specifies it, ITU T.6.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">g3topbm converts the MH format
to PBM. pbmtog3 converts PBM to MH.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is no Netpbm program to
convert to or from other fax formats.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TIFF <br>
The TIFF format is flexible enough to allow lots of
different coding methods, within it. There are TIFF
subformats for MH, MR, and MMR, among others. These are
particularly <br>
useful when you receive a fax as a TIFF file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tifftopnm recognizes and can
convert from any of these.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pamtotiff can convert to any of
these; you use command options to choose which.</p>
