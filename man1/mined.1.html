<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;NEW&acirc; Note: Mined
suppresses backup file names from the command line file list
if they appear after their base version name as generated by
command line auto-completion, in order <br>
to prevent their accidental editing; thus after file name
&quot;x&quot; the following would be excluded from the file
list (where N is a number): &quot;x~&quot;, &quot;x;N&quot;,
&quot;x.~N~&quot;, so that, e.g., mined <br>
x* edits x and x1 but not x~.</p>

&rsquo;n&rsquo; to navigate to the next choice (like
cursor-right), <br>
&rsquo;r&rsquo; to navigate to the next row (like
cursor-down), <br>
&rsquo;s&rsquo; to select the current choice (like
Enter).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-K=im-im (input method
selection) <br>
Select input method and/or standby input method (for quick
switching with Alt-k). The syntax is the same as for the
optional environment variable MINEDKEYMAP (see below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Terminal mode <br>
-U (terminal mode) <br>
Toggles UTF-8 screen handling assumption, i.e. selects UTF-8
screen handling unless UTF-8 keyboard input is already
selected (by another -U option or environment setting). <br>
In the latter case, -U deselects UTF-8 terminal operation.
This option should normally not be used as the mode should
be configured in the environment (see Locale config&acirc;
<br>
uration).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+U (terminal mode) <br>
Selects UTF-8 screen handling. Note that none of the options
-U or +U needs to be used if the environment is correctly
configured to indicate UTF-8 as it should (see Uni&acirc;
<br>
code handling / Terminal environment). <br>
Also, mined performs auto-detection of UTF-8 terminal
encoding and UTF-8 terminal features (different width data
versions, handling of double-width, combining and joining
<br>
characters), so even if the environment is not correctly
configured, mined should work without this explicit terminal
mode parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+UU (terminal mode) <br>
Selects bidirectional terminal support. This mode implies
UTF-8 and also assumes that Arabic ligature joining (of
LAM/ALEF combinations) is applied; it will be handled by
<br>
mined accordingly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+UU-U (terminal mode) <br>
Selects bidirectional terminal support without Arabic
ligature joining (like mintty).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-cc (terminal mode) <br>
Assumes that the terminal does not support combining
characters. By default - unless otherwise detected - mined
assumes that combining characters work on UTF-8 terminals
<br>
and do not work in CJK terminals.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+c (terminal mode) <br>
Assumes that the terminal supports combining characters.
This is enabled by default for UTF-8 terminals, and disabled
by default for CJK terminals, unless otherwise <br>
detected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+EX (terminal mode) <br>
Where X is one of B/G/C/J/X/S/x/K/H: Assumes a CJK encoded
terminal in one of the supported CJK character encodings.
For details, see CJK encoding support.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+EX (terminal mode) <br>
Where X is one of g/c/j: Assumes a CJK encoded terminal in
one of the CJK character encodings like G/C/J and also
assumes that the terminal cannot display GB18030 4-byte <br>
encodings, CNS 4-byte encodings, EUC-JP 3-byte encodings,
respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+EX (terminal mode) <br>
Where X is one of U/L or another 1-letter character encoding
tag: Assumes a Unicode/UTF-8 or Latin-1 encoded terminal,
respectively, or an 8-bit terminal running one of <br>
the other supported character encodings. For details on
supported encodings, see the Quick Options (Mode indication)
flags listing. For details on terminal encoding sup&acirc;
<br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+E=charmap (terminal mode) <br>
Where charmap is a character encoding name (as reported by

the respective encoding. For details on locale- <br>
related character encoding configuration, see Locale
configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+E.suffix (terminal mode) <br>
Where suffix is a character encoding suffix
(&quot;codeset&quot;) as used in locale names: Assumes the
terminal to have the respective encoding. For details on
locale-related char&acirc; <br>
acter encoding configuration, see Locale configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+E:flag (terminal mode) <br>
Where flag is a 2-letter indication used by mined to
indicate the respective encoding as text encoding in the

<br>
encoding. For details on supported encodings and their
flags, see the Quick Options (Mode indication) flags
listing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+E? (terminal mode) <br>
Determine the terminal encoding and further terminal
encoding features and properties by auto-detection, print
out the information and quit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C (character set and terminal
mode) <br>
(Deprecated.) Turns a subsequent -E option (with a
single-letter CJK tag) effectively into a combined -E and +E
option. So mined assumes the given CJK encoding for both
<br>
terminal encoding (unless overridden by UTF-8 terminal
auto-detection) and text encoding. Can be used for quick
indication of CJK terminals (e.g. cxterm, kterm, hanterm)
<br>
if locale environment is not properly set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+C (terminal mode) <br>
Displays unknown characters on CJK terminal: Assumes a CJK
encoded terminal (e.g. cxterm, kterm, hanterm; more specific
encoding specification is advisable), and charac&acirc; <br>
ters encoded in a CJK encoding format are displayed
transparently even if they do not map to a valid Unicode
character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+CC (terminal mode) <br>
Displays invalid characters on CJK terminal: Implies +C, but
even character codes that do not match the encoding scheme
(e.g. wrt. to specified byte ranges) are written <br>
transparently to the terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+CCC (terminal mode) <br>
Displays extended characters on CJK terminal: Implies +CC
and overrides auto-detection of the terminal capability to
display CJK 3-byte / 4-byte codes which would by <br>
default suppress their display if the terminal does not
support them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+D (keyboard assignment) <br>
Setup xterm (by sending dynamic configuration codes) to
apply two useful keyboard handling modes: Del key on small
keypad sends DEL character rather than an escape <br>
sequence and can thus be distinguished from the Del key on
the big (numeric) keypad. Prepend ESC to character if
pressed with the Alt or Meta key in order to enable Alt-
<br>
commands (e.g. Alt-f to open the file menu, Alt-Shift-H to
enter HTML markers etc). (Unfortunately this cannot be done
by default as it cannot be undone because the pre&acirc;
<br>
vious state cannot be detected.) (This xterm setting should
rather be configured permanently as suggested in the sample
file Xdefaults.mined in the Mined runtime support <br>
library.)</p>

<br>
Switch the Home and End key functions of the two keypads
(small keypad, numeric keypad), i.e. exchange the two
keypads with respect to these keys. This assigns the more
<br>
usual functions &quot;goto line beginning&quot;, &quot;goto
line end&quot; to the Home and End keys of the right keypad.
The (assumedly more useful) mined default is to assign the
frequently <br>
used paste buffer functions (mark, copy) to these keys. <br>
In turn, the assigned functions of the Home and End keys of
the small keypad (&quot;editing keypad&quot;) are exchanged
to provide the other function than on the right keypad, <br>
respectively - provided the terminal and its configuration
support this distinction. <br>
Also Alt-Home/End are assigned the respective other
functions on each keypad so the most useful keypad functions
should always be quite easily available. <br>
Regardless of this switching, mined tries to map fixed
functions to modified Home and End keys: Ctrl-Home/End for
line begin/end movement (both keypads), Shift-Home/End <br>
for the paste buffer copy functions (small keypad) -
provided the terminal, its mode and configuration support

Mined is always in insert mode. Commands are single control
characters, double key commands starting with ESCAPE, and a
collection of function keys (for various types of key&acirc;
<br>
boards and terminals). As a specialty, note the prefixing
&rsquo;HOP KEY&rsquo; which amplifies or expands the effect
of certain commands &quot;just as you would expect&quot;;
this provides for more <br>
command flexibility without having to remember too many
keys. It is described in a separate section below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Keypad layout <br>
Control key layout for basic movement functions is
topographic on the left-hand side of the keyboard (an idea
originating from early editors, when keyboards didn&rsquo;t
have cursor <br>
keypads). (Although using a cursor block is more
comfortable, a simple set of control key assignments is
useful as a fallback on terminals or remote connections with
reduced <br>
functionality.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The right-hand cursor block of
typical keyboards is assigned the most important movement
and paste buffer functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Keypad assignment features:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Mined optimizes
keypad usage for most frequently used functions, especially
paste buffer functions in addition to navigation functions,
by making them easily acces&acirc; <br>
sible on the keypad.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; For this
purpose, mined distinguished between Home/End keys on the
numeric keypad and on the small keypad (whenever possible
with the terminal) in order to <br>
avoid the waste of resources by the usually redundant
mapping of these two keypad blocks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Note: this means
that on the big (&quot;numeric&quot;) keypad the mined
keypad function assignment for Home/End deviates from their
more usual meanings. This is <br>
deliberately designed to enhance support of quick copy/paste
with these easily reachable keys, while line movement can
also easily be achieved with HOP cur&acirc; <br>
sor-left or HOP cursor-right, respectively. <br>
This keypad function assignment gives you the best benefit
of keypad usage and is thus considered much more useful than
the &quot;standard assignment&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The Del and
Backarrow keys perform their usual dual-mode function; if a
visual selection is active, they delete the selection (with
a Cut to the paste buf&acirc; <br>
fer), if there is no visual selection, they delete the next
or previous character, respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">small (&quot;editing&quot;)

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See The HOP function below for
alternative keys to trigger it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Mined offers
additional function mappings for modified keypad keys, both
for providing unambiguous mappings in any case and to handle
the deviation of its benefit- <br>
optimized Home/End keypad mapping from frequent
expectations, and an option to customize Home/End:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Alt-Home/End are
mapped to the Home/End functions of the other keypad,
respectively. So by default, on the numeric keypad they
invoke the line navigation <br>
functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The -k option
exchanges Home/End functions of the small and numeric
keypads with each other, and switches Alt-Home/End to also
invoke the &quot;other&quot; function, <br>
respectively: keypad function assignments:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; (cf Windows
keypad mode below) Ctrl-Del is always mapped to character
deletion, while Shift-Del is mapped to the paste buffer Cut
function, regardless of the <br>
visual selection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; (cf Windows
keypad mode below) Ctrl-Home/End are always mapped to line
navigation, while Shift-Home/End are mapped to the paste
buffer functions Mark/Copy, <br>
regardless of the -k option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Alt-Del is
mapped to the respective &quot;other&quot; function,
depending on visual selection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Note: Keypad
function assignments as described depend on terminal support
to distinguish all involved keys and modifiers which is
unfortunately not always <br>
the case. <br>
Terminal support for proper distinction of different keypads
and modified keys may be enhanced by appropriate terminal
configuration, see the section on Key&acirc; <br>
pad configuration. <br>
&acirc;NEW&acirc; With xterm since 280, all desired
distinctions between different keypads as well as modified
keypad keys are achieved (by using the modifyKeyboard <br>
resource mode in combination with VT220 Keyboard and
Application Keypad modes).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Two Keypad modes
(see below) change the function assignment of the
keypads.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; In Shift-select
mode (option -kS), Shift-modified keypad keys activate or
extend a visual text selection; also Shift-5 (on keypad)
performs Copy to paste <br>
buffer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; In Windows
keypad mode (option -kw), additionally non-shifted keypad
keys are changed to perform the more common functions, at
the price of losing the easy <br>
Home/End assignment to invoke Mark/Copy to paste buffer
(which can however be overridden with options -kc and -kC).
See Keypad modes below for an overview.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The HOP function <br>
This function, triggered by any of the HOP keys, amplifies
or expands functions as listed below. To achieve the
combined function, first press any key that is assigned the
HOP <br>
function, then any key assigned the base function from the
table below. <br>
Note: To enable using the HOP function also on keyboards
that do not support the keypad &quot;5&quot; or
&quot;*&quot; keys (e.g. small notebooks without numeric
keypad), a few alternative HOP keys <br>
are provided: Control-Q, Shift-TAB, the Menu or Windows keys
(if running Linux), or (providing a dual-mode function) the
Control-G and ESC keys.</p>

is open, any HOP key or the Space key or the middle mouse
button toggles the HOP amplifier/expander for a function
subsequently invoked in the <br>
menu; the menu redisplays with function names changed where
applicable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Character-oriented navigation
and editing <br>
From the traditional restriction of Unix tools to the line
as a unit of operation, other editors are stuck in a
line-oriented movement and insertion paradigm which implies
some <br>
weird and counter-intuitive behaviour. <br>
Mined handles the end-of-line position like any ordinary
character during movement and editing operations. Also
search and replacement strings can contain line ends.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mouse control and menus <br>
All versions of mined (Unix, DOS/Windows) support mouse
operation. <br>
Mouse control operates on pull-down and pop-up menus, flags,
the text area, the bottom line, and the scroll bar, in order
to provide the most useful functions and menu- <br>
driven command selection at hand.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Summary of mouse functions:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In text area:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Menus <br>
Mined provides three kinds of menus, all can be opened with
either mouse clicks or commands. The menus offer the most
important editing functions (apart from simple movement).
<br>
Some menus have their items grouped into sections, some of
which have subtitles. <br>
The HOP flag can be toggled while a menu is open with any of
the HOP key, ^G, Space, or the middle mouse button. When a
pull-down menu is opened with the middle mouse button, <br>
the HOP variation is initially triggered, offering the HOP
variations of the menu items. <br>
The three menu groups are used as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A pull-down menu
is opened by clicking the mouse on the menu header (in the
left part of the top screen line) or scrolling the mouse
wheel on this header. <br>
Shortcut: Each pull-down menu can also be opened with ESC or
Alt and the small initial letter of the menu header (Alt-f
or ESC f for the file menu etc.).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A flag menu is
opened by clicking the right mouse button on a flag
indication in the flags area (right part of the top screen
line) or scrolling the mouse wheel on <br>
it. The flag menus have optional markers in front of each
item showing which items are currently active. <br>
Shortcut: The Info menu, Input Method (Keyboard Mapping)
menu, Smart Quotes menu, Encoding menu can also be opened
with Alt-F10, Alt-I, Alt-K, Alt-Q, or Alt-E, <br>
respectively (or use an ESC prefix instead of an Alt-
modifier respectively).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The pop-up menu
is placed above the text area and can be opened with a
right-click or Alt-Space (ESC Space).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Menu navigation <br>
When a menu is open, the cursor-left or cursor-right keys
cycle through the pull-down and flag menus. Alt-cursor-left
and Alt-cursor-right navigate quickly between the two sets
<br>
of menus (pull-down or flag menus). <br>
When a submenu is open, cursor-left goes back to the parent
menu, cursor-right opens its next menu to the right.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are three methods to
navigate within a menu:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; With the
keyboard: open menu as described above, navigate with cursor
keys or by typing the first letter of the desired menu item
(which cycles through all items <br>
starting with that letter, or containing a word starting
with that letter); activate menu item with Enter key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; With mouse
clicks: open menu with click (and release) mouse button,
switch to other menu with another click, click on item to
activate it. The mouse wheel may be <br>
used to navigate menu items.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; With mouse
dragging: open menu with mouse button (left or right),
browse menus and items with button held down, activate
selected item with releasing mouse button. <br>
Methods may be mixed, e.g. open a menu with either mouse
click or keyboard, navigate with mouse wheel, then select
with Enter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When selecting a menu item, in
most cases the associated function is carried out and the
menu closed afterwards. In some cases, an option is toggled
and the menu stays open <br>
(esp. in Info menu: Han info pronunciation selection,
character information &quot;with&quot; attributes
selection).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Scrollable menus: In a
low-height terminal (e.g. 24 lines), longer menus
(especially the Encoding menu and the Input Method menu) may
not fit on the terminal. All menus are <br>
scrollable with cursor keys, including Page Down/Up, Home,
End keys. <br>
When the window size is changed, open menus are closed in
order to prevent resizing and repositioning problems; this
is planned to be enhanced in a future version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hints <br>
Note: Your mouse driver or Windows system may be configured
to generate multiple (e.g. 3) mouse wheel events on one
mouse wheel movement (e.g. with Windows). An option -L1 <br>
could compensate for that scaling (as mined applies a mouse
wheel factor by itself which is 3 by default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Layout configuration: See Menu
display below for configuration of menu appearance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Configuration hint: On Unix, in
order to make Alt work as a modifier, set the xterm resource
metaSendsEscape to true and the rxvt resource meta8 to false
as suggested in the <br>
example file Xdefaults.mined in the Mined runtime support
library. (With older versions of xterm, setting
eightBitInput to false may be required instead; this xterm
option <br>
doesn&rsquo;t actually disable 8 bit input as its name might
suggest.) With xterm, this setting can also be enforced
dynamically with the +D option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Interoperable and multiple paste
buffers <br>
System paste buffer / Clipboard <br>
&acirc;NEW&acirc; In the Windows/cygwin version, Shift-Ins
inserts the Windows clipboard rather than the mined paste
buffer. Copy to paste buffer always fills paste buffer and
the clipboard, <br>
too. &acirc;NEW&acirc; In this case, the lineend type is not
copied from the clipboard (i.e. typically CRLF) but adapted
to the current line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Inter-window paste buffer <br>
Mined can perform copy/paste operations within different
editing sessions (parallel or subsequent invocations of
mined): The command HOP Ins (e.g. ^G ^P) will insert the
most <br>
recent paste buffer copied or cut in any of the user&rsquo;s
mined sessions. This can also work remotely in a network; to
configure this features, see Common paste buffer
configura&acirc; <br>
tion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Multiple paste buffers <br>
Mined provides emacs-style multiple paste buffers that are
organised as a buffer ring. Every buffer cut or copy
operation (that places the text between the marked and the
current <br>
position to the buffer) creates a new buffer and stacks it
to the list of buffers. If the feature &quot;deleted
word/line appends to buffer&quot; is enabled (+VV) the
commands delete-end- <br>
of-line (^K), delete-word (^T) and delete-end-of-sentence
(currently emacs mode only) append to the top buffer
(disabled with the option -VV). <br>
To paste a non-top-most buffer, paste the most recent buffer
first as usual, then use the buffer-ring command (Alt-Ins or
Ctrl-F4, or M-y in emacs mode) to exchange the pasted <br>
text with the previous buffer. This can be repeated, going
down the stack of buffers, and at its bottom, starting over
from the top again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Keypad modes and Visual
selection <br>
Mined highlights text selection visually, with both mouse
selection and keyboard selection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Keypad modes <br>
&Acirc;&middot; In Shift-select mode (enabled with option
-kS), Shift-modified keypad keys start or extend visual text
selection; otherwise the keypad functions are not modified,
<br>
so that e.g. the useful quick Mark/Copy selection with
Home/End keys can still be used. <br>
Note: terminal support to report Shift-modified cursor keys
is required to enable this feature. <br>
The option adjusts some other interactive responses as well
to match common selection practice:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; auto-copy (after
click-and-drag) is disabled</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
Shift-mouse-left-click extends the selection (if supported
by terminal)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
mouse-right-click does not extend the selection before
opening the menu</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; in addition,
Shift-HOP is mapped to the Copy function <br>
Shift selection keypad functions are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Shift-Left <br>
select character left</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Shift-Right <br>
select character right</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Shift-Control-Left <br>
select word left</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Shift-Control-Right <br>
select word right</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Shift-Up <br>
select line up</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Shift-Down <br>
select line down</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Shift-Control-Up <br>
select to previous beginning of paragraph</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Shift-Control-Down <br>
select to next beginning of paragraph</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Shift-Home <br>
select to beginning of line</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Shift-End <br>
select to end of line</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Shift-Control-Home <br>
select to beginning of text</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Shift-Control-End <br>
select to end of text</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Shift-PgUp <br>
select to previous page</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Shift-PgDn <br>
select to next page</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Shift-5 (on keypad) <br>
copy selected text to paste buffer</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; In Windows
keypad mode (enabled with option -kw, also implied by
Windows emulation option +ew), additionally non-shifted
keypad keys are changed to perform the more <br>
common functions, at the price of losing the easy Home/End
assignment to invoke Mark/Copy to paste buffer (which can
however be overridden with options -kc for the <br>
small (&quot;editing&quot;) keypad and -kC for the big
(&quot;numeric&quot;) keypad). Also, some Control-modified
keys change their function assignment to match more common
usage. <br>
Keypad functions include the Shift selection functions above
and add the following functions:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Home move cursor to previous
beginning of line</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">End move cursor to next end of
line</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Control-Left <br>
move cursor to previous beginning of word</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Control-Right <br>
move cursor to next end of word</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Control-Up <br>
move cursor to previous beginning of paragraph</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Control-Down <br>
move cursor to next beginning of paragraph</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Control-Home <br>
move cursor to beginning of text</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Control-End <br>
move cursor to end of text</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Control-Backarrow <br>
delete word left</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Control-Del <br>
delete word right</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOP Control-Backarrow <br>
delete to beginning of line</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOP Control-Del <br>
delete to end of line</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Shift-select mode (-kS) may

Selection behaviour can be tuned with a few options in the
Paste buffer menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: The actual behaviour of
the paste buffer functions acting on the text selection
(Copy, Cut) are not affected by the visual selection; they
work alike even if the selection <br>
is hidden. <br>
The Delete key is the only function that is actually
modified by visual selection, following a dual-mode
behaviour consistent with most contemporary text editors: if
a non-empty <br>
visual selection is active, it deletes the selected area
(Cut to paste buffer), otherwise, it deletes the next
character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Rectangular copy/paste <br>
Rectangular copy/paste area mode can be toggled on the Paste
buffer flag (see also description of Quick Options (Mode
indication) flags), in the Paste buffer menu, with HOP Mark
<br>
while already on marked position, or preselected with the
option +[. <br>
&acirc;NEW&acirc; Rectangular selection can also be toggled
temporarily by using Alt with the left mouse button while
moving the mouse for drag-selection. Note, however, that a
subsequent <br>
paste will apply the untoggled mode. <br>
Note: Rectangular area is a property of the copy/paste
function, not of the paste buffer. <br>
Note: The result of rectangular paste may not be quite as
expected in these cases:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The paste buffer
contains lines of different length.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The border of
the paste area (in either the text or the paste buffer)
contains characters of different width, like TAB,
double-width, or isolated combining charac&acirc; <br>
ters, or even incomplete character codes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Text position markers <br>
A default marker for quick use and additional
&acirc;NEW&acirc; 16 numbered text markers are available.
<br>
Marker 0 has a special function: 1. it is set when opening a
file at the memorized position, 2. whenever a new current
marker is set, the previous one is pushed to marker 0. <br>
For keyboard commands to set and move to markers, see Text
marker navigation in the Command reference below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Text position marker stack <br>
In addition to the explicit text markers, mined implicitly
maintains a marker stack to support navigation and
orientation when browsing files. Whenever a command moves
the posi&acirc; <br>
tion by a far distance (Go to marker, Go to line, Go to file
beginning/end, Go to next/previous file, Search functions
including Search identifier definition across files, <br>
Replace with confirm), the current position is first pushed
to this stack. Later, in order to return to the previous
position, use the command ESC Enter (Alt-Enter) to move <br>
along the positions in the marker stack. The command HOP ESC
Enter (HOP Alt-Enter) moves again forward along the
stack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Paragraph justification / word
wrap <br>
Manual paragraph line/word wrap is invoked with the justify
command (ESC j or ESC J); it justifies the current paragraph
(wraps its lines/words) according to the effective
mar&acirc; <br>
gins and paragraph termination mode. <br>
Clever justification: With ESC j, mined automatically
determines left margins depending on the current paragraph
and line contents. Heuristic detection of numbered items
will <br>
trigger automatic indentation. <br>
Normal justification: With ESC J, mined justifies strictly
according to the margin values currently configured. <br>
See commands listing below &quot;ESC j&quot; for margin
setting commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Paragraph termination modes: Two
different definitions of paragraph end are available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The primary mode
is to add a space at the end of each line when the paragraph
continues and to end the line without space where the
paragraph ends. This seems an <br>
intuitive way and as a big advantage over other approaches,
it is transparent with respect to visual formatting, i.e. no
text property is required that would affect <br>
visual layout of the text. <br>
Note: Additional visual support of paragraph end detection
is available with the mined option -p that distinguishes
paragraph/line end display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The other
word-wrap mode is to add an empty (blank-only) line after
each paragraph. Obviously this imposes more additional
requirements on text formatting disci&acirc; <br>
pline and reduces freedom of text layout. <br>
The mode in effect is indicated in the Quick Options (Mode
indication) flags display; see description of Quick Options
(Mode indication) flags.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Auto indentation <br>
By default, mined acts in auto-indent mode: When you enter a
newline, the following line will be filled with the same
prefix of space characters (Space or Tab) as the current
<br>
one. This option can be toggled from the Options menu. A new
line without auto indentation can be entered with the ^O
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Auto indentation is
automatically suppressed if text is entered very fast (by
heuristic detection of input speed) in order to allow
unmodified copy and paste using terminal <br>
mouse functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;NEW&acirc; <br>
Advanced list support (bullet and numbered lists) A new
paragraph (according to the currently selected paragraph end
mode, or considering Unicode paragraph separators) after a
<br>
bullet or numbered item will clone the bullet or
auto-increment the numbering. The undent function (smart
Backspace) considers list bullets or numberings, removing
the last <br>
level. <br>
Note: An item paragraph is considered to start at a bullet
or numbering even if the previous line does not terminate a
paragraph.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Structure input commands <br>
A pair of parentheses with matched indentation can be
entered by prefixing a parenthesis character with HOP. For
example, HOP &quot;{&quot; would enter a pair of
&quot;{&quot; &quot;}&quot;, both auto- <br>
indented on their respective new line. Other pairs are
&quot;(&quot; &quot;)&quot;, &quot;[&quot; &quot;]&quot;,
&quot;&lt;&quot; &quot;&gt;&quot;. <br>
HOP &quot;/&quot; enters an indented Javadoc comment
frame.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Back-Tab (Undent function /
reverse indent) <br>
Smart backspacing: A Backarrow key from a position that is
only preceded by white space on the line and on the line
above will revert the input position to the previous
matching <br>
indentation level. To avoid auto-undentation (&quot;Delete
single&quot;), use Ctrl-Backarrow or F5 Backarrow to delete
only one character left, or toggle auto-indentation off from
the <br>
Options menu. <br>
Note: In xterm, Ctrl-Backarrow only works if configured in
your X configuration, see the example configuration file
Xdefaults.mined in the Mined runtime support library. <br>
Note:&acirc;NEW&acirc; Configuration option plain_BS
(command line option +Bp) switches the Backarrow key from
smart backspacing to plain backspacing, i.e. no auto-undent
and only delete one <br>
combining character of a combined character. Use
Shift-Control-Backarrow to perform smart backspacing
then.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tab expansion <br>
With one of the options -+8, -+4, -+2, a Tab key input will
be expanded to an appropriate number of Space characters
instead of inserting a Tab character. You can still insert a
<br>
literal Tab character with Ctrl-V Tab.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Search and replace multiple
lines <br>
Mined has overcome the typical Unix tool limitation of line
orientation in search operations. Search and replacement
patterns can contain embedded newlines. Enter a newline <br>
(linefeed character) in the search string with ^V^J or (orto
match CRLF newlines). (In some cases there are still display
problems; then update the screen with the ESC <br>
&quot;.&quot; command.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Header line underlining <br>
The command HOP &quot;-&quot; (e.g. Ctrl-G -) underlines the
header line before the cursor position with as many
&quot;-&quot; characters as needed; it applies to the
current line unless the cursor <br>
is at a line beginning in which case it applies to the
previous line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Automatic backspace mode
adaptation <br>
There is much confusion about what character codes are
delivered by the Backarrow and Del keyboard keys in
different operating environments and configurations. For
proper opera&acirc; <br>
tion, the &quot;stty erase CHAR&quot; configuration should
generally be set correctly to reflect the actual code
emitted by the terminal. Mined detects this setting and
adjusts its han&acirc; <br>
dling accordingly, so that the &quot;Backarrow&quot; key
should normally work as expected (delete a character
left).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Overview: input support features
<br>
Character input <br>
Mined provides several methods to support input of special
characters that may not be easily available on the
keyboard.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Accented and
mnemonic input support defines Accent prefix keys to compose
accent combinations with subsequently entered
characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; It also provides
Character input mnemonics for easily memorisable input of a
wide range of characters, including most composed Unicode
characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Input support
commands include a quick shortcut for two-character
mnemonics.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Input support
commands also provide for character input by hexadecimal /
octal / decimal character code or Unicode value, including
support for subsequent entry of <br>
multiple numeric characters according to ISO 14755.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Keyboard mapping
switching the keyboard to support another script. This
feature also provides CJK input methods.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Structured input <br>
&Acirc;&middot; HTML tag input (starting/closing or
embedding marked text).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Auto indentation
and Back-Tab.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Structure input
commands: Input of indented matching parentheses and Javadoc
frames.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Paragraph
justification (line/word wrap).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Header line
underlining</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Special features <br>
&Acirc;&middot; Smart quotes automatic transformation of
entered straight quote marks into typographic quotation
marks (style can be selected in flags area) or apostrophe,
separate <br>
accents as appropriate typographic symbols, as well as smart
dashes and other smart text replacements.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Right-to-left
script input support.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Handling files with mined <br>
Tags file support / Identifier and file lookup <br>
The ESC t command moves to the definition of an identifier
(on which the cursor should be placed) using the tags file
(generated by the ctags command). HOP ESC t prompts for an
<br>
identifier. (Also available from search or popup menu.) If a
new file is opened for this purpose, the current file is
saved automatically. <br>
As a special function, if ESC t is typed on an include
statement (line beginning with &quot;#include&quot; or
&quot;include&quot;), the included file will be opened. <br>
Note: Like with a number of positioning commands, ESC t
places the current position on the position marker stack
before going to the location of the identifier definition.
The <br>
command ESC Enter (Alt-Enter) moves back to that position,
also saving the current file if needed first.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;NEW&acirc; <br>
Encrypted files Mined edits encrypted files transparently.
<br>
For reading or writing an encrypted file, a respective
filter is used as configured in the runtime configuration
file $HOME/.minedrc. See the sample configuration file in
the <br>
Mined runtime support library for details. It contains
pre-configured entries for using GnuPG (for files ending
with &quot;.gpg&quot; or &quot;.pgp&quot;) or openssl (for
files ending with &quot;.ssl&quot;). <br>
Mined does not currently provide handling for passwords or
passphrases for file encryption. Therefore, any passwords or
passphrases needed for encrypted file access will either
<br>
have to be entered on every access, or password or
passphrase files may be used as offered by the respective
decryption and encryption commands of GnuPG and openssl. See
the sam&acirc; <br>
ple configuration file for examples. <br>
Note: If manual password input is used with openssl, be
careful to remember the password which is newly assigned
every time the file is written. <br>
Note: When editing an encrypted file, the backup file will
be encrypted, too. Decrypted content is exchanged with the
filters using pipes, so no intermediate decrypted version is
<br>
stored on the file system. Copy/paste text blocks are not
encrypted, though, but they are readable for the current
user only anyway (on any nontrivial file system). The same
<br>
applies for a recovery file that mined writes in emergency
cases to save the edited text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Data safety and security <br>
Mined has a robust and defensive concept of handling edited
text and file contents in case of any kind of program or
system errors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Backup files <br>
With command line option(s) +b, mined saves a backup copy of
any file being overwritten (like saving the file being
edited, saving to a different file, copying the paste buffer
<br>
to a file). It supports three backup file name conventions
and a few combined modes to select among them:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+b- no backup files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+bs simple backup files:
filename~</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+be emacs style numbered backup
files: filename.~N~ where N are increasing version
numbers</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+bv VMS style numbered backup
files: filename;N (using the original notation of the VMS
operating system) where N are increasing version numbers</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+bn numbered backup files,
either emacs or VMS syntax, whichever already exists (with a
higher version number)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+ba automatic backup files,
either numbered if numbered backups (either style) already
exist, or simple</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: In order to preserve
possibly existing hard links to the file being edited, it is
actually copied, not just renamed for the backup version
(like with joe, vim, or emacs <br>
with option backup-by-copying). Note: In mined 2011.19, +ba
(automatic simple/numbered backup) is the default, and +b is
a shortcut for +ba. This is subject to change in a <br>
future version, however. Note: To select your preference,
use the runtime configuration file $HOME/.minedrc, or
include the respective option in the environment variable
MINE&acirc; <br>
DOPT, or set the environment variable VERSION_CONTROL
(compatible with usage by emacs and cp), with the following
mapping:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VERSION_CONTROL <br>
$HOME/.minedrc command line option</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">none or off <br>
backup_mode - +b- - no backups</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">numbered or t <br>
backup_mode e +be - emacs style numbered backups</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">existing or nil <br>
backup_mode a +ba - automatic backup mode</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">simple or never <br>
backup_mode s +bs - simple backups</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">backup_mode n <br>
+bn - numbered backups (automatic style)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">backup_mode v <br>
+bv - VMS style numbered backups</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: To place backup files in a
different directory than the original file, use the
environment variable BACKUP_DIRECTORY or BACKUPDIR. It can
be either an absolute pathname <br>
(e.g. $HOME/.backups) or a relative pathname (e.g. .~) in
which case backup files are stored relative to the
respective working directory of mined. Note: On VMS, backup
options <br>
are ignored as VMS handles backup files natively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File locking <br>
Mined checks and maintains interoperable lock files, which
are symbolic links mentioning the user and machine currently
editing the file (not on MSDOS and VMS). If the user <br>
tries to modify the text of a file locked by somebody else,
mined informs the user and changes editing mode to
view-only. The lock can be overridden (removed or ignored)
from <br>
the File menu. <br>
Mined implements workarounds for network file systems that
do not support handling lock files or symbolic links
properly: cygwin symbolic links that appear as plain text
files on <br>
Samba/CIFS mounted file shares, &acirc;NEW&acirc; and lock
files that could be created but cannot be deleted due to
weird permission configuration of a network file share.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Edited text / Recovery files
<br>
Every care has been taken to prevent loss of the edited text
in case of save errors or accidental quit commands etc;
mined always prompts before discarding any modified text,
<br>
even when editing without an associated filename (in which
case other popular editors ignore loss of edited text). <br>
There are three cases, however, in which edited text would
be lost:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; if the user
explicitly discards edited text (e.g. ESQ q and not
answering the &quot;Save?&quot; question with
&quot;y&quot;)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; if mined is sent
an external terminating signal (e.g. on terminal I/O error);
two exceptions are the SIGKILL signal (which cannot be
caught by a program) and <br>
SIGTERM (see below)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; in the rare case
that mined should fail with an internal signal (e.g. if out
of memory) <br>
In these cases, mined can save the edited text in a recovery
file dir/#name# (when editing file dir/name); in the
explicit case, this is only done if the answer to the
&quot;Save?&quot; <br>
question is &quot;r&quot; (to &quot;recover later&quot;). If
the edited file is later opened, and a recovery file still
exists (which is newer than the file being opened), mined
will display a <br>
notice. In the File menu, there is the option to recover the
text from the recovery file. Note: The recovery file is
interoperable with emacs (as are the use cases); however,
<br>
mined is superior here because emacs mangles non-ASCII
characters in recovery files. Mind, though, that
interoperability with respect to recognising recovery files
depends on <br>
consistent configuration of their location; see the
directory configuration option below. Note: If mined is sent
an explicit SIGTERM signal it tries to terminate normally
<br>
instead, writing modified text to the file being edited,
including interactive handling if needed. Note: After
catching a signal, mined also tries an emergency save of the
<br>
edited text into a &quot;panic file&quot; in one of the
directories $TMPDIR, $TMP, $TEMP, /usr/tmp, or /tmp
(whichever variable is defined first and directory is
writable in this order; or <br>
similar directories under VMS or MSDOS). The file contains
the edited text, identical to the recovery file. It is
written first, before the recovery file, to provide a quick
<br>
save attempt e.g. if the system is crashing and the file
system of the edited file is no longer available. Note: If
possible, mined also tries to continue normally after panic
<br>
handling (unless multiple external signals are nested).
Note: To place recovery files in a different directory than
the original file, use the environment variable <br>
AUTO_SAVE_DIRECTORY or AUTOSAVEDIR or BACKUP_DIRECTORY or
BACKUPDIR as described for backup files above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Overwriting files and
&acirc;NEW&acirc; <br>
Change monitoring If any command is issued to write to a
file not previously read in (after change of file name or
working directory, or with a Copy to file command), mined
<br>
prompts for confirmation. <br>
&acirc;NEW&acirc; Also, if mined detects that the file being
edited has been changed, it displays a notice and asks for
confirmation before saving. To this aim, mined checks the
modifica&acirc; <br>
tion time, &acirc;NEW&acirc; file size, device and inode (in
case the file got replaced by rename/move/mount operations).
This is checked if mined is notified of refocussing the
window (if <br>
supported by the terminal), and after shell commands (ESC !,
ESC c, ESC z).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File access permissions <br>
When creating a new file, its access permissions are set
according to the default behaviour set in the user
environment (umask setting in Unix). However, when cloning a
file <br>
(with Save As / Set Name / ESC n / ESC d), file access
permissions of the originally opened file are preserved and
cloned. <br>
The +x command line option adds executable permission to
newly created files but only to those users that are also
given read permission by the rules above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Special file types <br>
Character or block device files <br>
&acirc;NEW&acirc; Mined rejects reading from or writing to a
device file in order to prevent being blocked. Exception:
/dev/clipboard on cygwin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FIFO files <br>
Mined can edit a FIFO file (named pipe) like any other file.
Before mined can finish loading from the pipe, another
process needs to have written to it and then close it. <br>
Before mined can finish saving to the pipe, another process
needs to have opened it for reading.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pipe input <br>
When invoked within a pipe, redirecting input, mined loads
its text buffer from standard input. &acirc;NEW&acirc; Mined
does not manipulate the screen mode before data is available
from the <br>
pipe, so to some extent it can interwork even with screen
programs providing its input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pipe output <br>
In the &quot;Editing for standard output&quot; mode (i.e.
when invoked within a pipe, redirecting output), only one
&quot;file save&quot; operation can be performed writing to
standard output. If <br>
more than one such operations are issued (e.g. using the ESC
w / F2 , F3, or suspend command) only the first one will
write the text buffer to standard output; any subsequent one
<br>
is treated as usual (with empty file name).
&acirc;NEW&acirc; If mined exits after writing to a pipe, it
does not manipulate the screen mode after beginning to
write, so to some extent it <br>
can interwork even with screen programs taking its
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Line end modes and
binary-transparent editing <br>
Mined is binary transparent. It can handle all types of line
ends (Unix (LF), DOS (CRLF), Mac (CR, with option +R),
&acirc;NEW&acirc; ISO 8859/EBCDIC Next Line (NL, not after
auto-detection <br>
of text encoding), and Unicode separators (LS, PS))
simultaneously in the same editing session. They are
indicated by different visible line end indications. Files
without trail&acirc; <br>
ing line end can be edited and created (using the delete
character right function on the last line end). NUL
characters are handled as virtual line ends. Lines too long
for <br>
internal handling are split transparently (with a
&quot;none&quot; virtual line end). <br>
Character codes that are illegal in the currently selected
text encoding are maintained transparently and are clearly
indicated (e.g. illegal UTF-8 sequences in Unicode <br>
text). <br>
Files with mixed encoding (e.g. UTF-8 / 8 bit sections) can
be edited comfortably. <br>
Input: To enter a NUL character, use ^V # 0 or ^V &lt; NUL
or Ctrl-Space &gt; (if the keyboard supports
Ctrl-Space).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File info: Memory of file
position and editing style parameters <br>
On every file saving command, mined remembers the last text
position, paragraph justification margins (only if automatic
paragraph justification is active), selected Smart Quotes
<br>
style and Input Method (Keyboard Mapping), and TAB display
width. File info memory is relative to the working
directory, using a hidden file info file (.@mined - mined
also han&acirc; <br>
dles its DOS short name @MINED~1 where it occurs, to provide
some interoperability with the DOS version of mined);
previously used file marker files (@mined.mar) will be
migrated <br>
and cleared from duplicate entries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: File information is stored
every time the user invokes a command to save the file (even
if no write is performed because the text has not been
edited). When editing <br>
that file again (from the same working directory), mined
will automatically move to that position (and set text
marker 0 to it).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File info grooming <br>
Mined checks and removes duplicate entries (from previous
versions) in the file info file. With option +@, mined also
checks whether file info entries correspond to actual files
<br>
that exist and are visible to the user; it will otherwise
remove such entries. Mined can be called with this option
alone and will then exit after file info grooming. Mind,
how&acirc; <br>
ever, that files may be invisible only temporarily (e.g. due
to unmounted file systems, or unplugged USB drives), and
will get their info entries removed then, too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File chooser <br>
To select a filename for a file operation (e.g. open, save,
insert, write buffer), mined opens an interactive file
chooser that presents a listing of files and directories in
the <br>
current directory (for the change directory command, only
directories are shown). The list can be navigated and
manipulated in these ways:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; cursor keys
(including page down/up, end/begin)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; mouse movement
and scroll</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; entering a
filename prefix which navigates to the first file matching
it</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; TAB will usually
copy the current filename into the editing field (if it was
partially matching a file name, it is thus completed,
similar to file completion on the <br>
command line but case-insensitively)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; TAB on a
directory will navigate the file chooser into it</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; TAB or HOP while
the filename editing field is containing wildcards
interprets the entered file name as a pattern and switches
to a filtered file listing (recognis&acirc; <br>
ing &quot;*&quot;, &quot;?&quot;, &quot;[abc-x]&quot;,
&quot;[^abc-x]&quot; wildcard expressions, no escapes)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Enter on a
directory will navigate the file chooser into it (unless for
the ESC d command in which case it is selected)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Enter on a
selected (or entered) filename will choose the name <br>
Also, a filename can be typed in directly (being interpreted
as a filename prefix interactively). The filename or prefix
is displayed in the title bar of the popup file chooser <br>
menu. When entering file or directory names, the leading ~
notation to refer to one&rsquo;s home directory is accepted.
Note: The full path name of the currently displayed
directory <br>
is shown as the first entry in the file chooser menu. Note:
A few sorting options are offered in the &quot;Options&quot;
- &quot;File sort options...&quot; submenu. They can also be
preselected <br>
with the command line option +zX. See the file chooser
options for details. Note: In the file chooser, filenames
are interpreted in Unicode (UTF-8 encoding) while file name
<br>
parameters given on the command line are interpreted in the
terminal encoding. This may lead to inconsistent handling of
non-ASCII filenames. Use the ESC ? command to display the
<br>
file name using native encoding. Note: On some file systems,
retrieving directory information can be slow.
&acirc;NEW&acirc; Mined handles this and provides feedback
about delayed opera&acirc; <br>
tion, retrieves directory information lazy by page being
displayed, and flushes display of the file chooser by line
to provide visual feedback about the file information being
<br>
retrieved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;NEW&acirc; <br>
File tabs Mined provides virtual file tabs above the header
line, listing file names as opened via command line or file
chooser. By clicking a file name in the file tabs panel,
<br>
or hold-and-move the mouse over them, you can change the
file being edited. If the current file has been modified it
will be saved first.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File switcher <br>
The File switcher presents a list of active files to select
from, comprising files supplied on the command line, and
files opened or saved later. Invoke the File switcher with
<br>
Alt-# or ESC #, or Alt-F3 or ESC F3, or from the File menu.
The Close file command (from the File menu) closes the
current file and removes its name from the list. The list
can <br>
be navigated and manipulated in these ways:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; cursor keys
(including page down/up, end/begin)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; mouse movement
and scroll</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; entering a
filename prefix which navigates to the first file matching
it</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Enter on a
selected (or entered) filename will choose the name <br>
To reload the current file and stay (approximately) at the
current position, use ESC Enter (Alt-Enter) after
reloading.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Page length <br>
The command ESC P sets the number of lines that mined
assumes to be on a page. So the status line can contain the
page number to make finding the current position in a
print-out <br>
easy. Also the Goto Line/% command (^G etc.) accepts a final
<br>
&rsquo;p&rsquo; or &rsquo;P&rsquo; in which cases it
positions to the top of the given page. This information
will be associated and stored with the file name if file
position memory is enabled; see <br>
File info: Memory of file position and editing style
parameters above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Restricted mode (tool mode) <br>
Restricted mode is triggered with <br>
&lt;code&gt;mined -- [ filenames ... ] <br>
or (if installed) <br>
&lt;code&gt;rmined [ filenames ... ] <br>
In restricted mode, only the file opened when mined was
started can be edited, no commands changing file name
reference, involving other files (copy/paste), or escaping
to a <br>
shell command will be allowed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Version control integration <br>
From the File menu, checkout and checkin commands are
available that invoke &quot;co&quot; or &quot;ci&quot;
scripts, respectively (which must reside in the user&rsquo;s
command search path). This offers <br>
a gateway to ClearCase or other version control systems;
mined applies automatic save or screen update as
appropriate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Printing <br>
From the File menu, a print command is available that prints
the text currently being edited. If the script uprint is
installed and configured properly, printing works in any
<br>
selected character encoding. See Printing configuration for
further details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In Windows, mined uses notepad
/p for printing. <br>
Note: The font size interactively configured in notepad also
affects the print size; with a fixed-width font, a font size
of not more than 10pt gives you at least 80 characters <br>
per line; if 72 characters per line are enough, you can use
11pt font size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Working with mined <br>
Quick Options (Mode indication) flags <br>
The right side of the top menu bar displays a number of
one-letter or two-letter indications for certain modes; the
associated flag menus can be opened from here with a mouse

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Scrollbar <br>
By default, mined displays a scrollbar at the right side. It
may be used for position indication within the text and for
relative or absolute positioning with the three mouse <br>
buttons. <br>
In a UTF-8 terminal, mined uses Unicode character cell
vertical eighths characters U+2581..U+2587 for a
fine-grained scrollbar display. If your Unicode font
doesn&rsquo;t include those <br>
block characters, you may switch to the cell-grained
scrollbar with the -o1 option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Text position marker stack <br>
On commands that jump away from the current position (HOP
Mark, File Begin/End, Search, Search identifier definition,
Search current character, Goto Line/%, Goto Next/Previous
<br>
File), the current position is remembered in a position
stack. The command ESC Enter goes backward, HOP ESC Enter
forward in this &quot;stack&quot;, even if this means
switching the file <br>
being edited.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Structured editing support <br>
HTML support: syntax highlighting and tag entry/matching
<br>
HTML tag entry: With the ESC H commands, opening and closing
HTML tags can be entered or (with HOP) a marked area can be
enclosed into HTML tags. <br>
Syntax highlighting: HTML tags and comments,
&acirc;NEW&acirc; attributes and values can be highlighted,
or dimmed to set them back from the actual text contents; if
mined detects a dark <br>
terminal background (works with xterm and mintty), it adds a
highlighting background to improve the contrast. Other
highlighting modes apply to HTML comments and JSP code. This
<br>
option is activated if the file name suffix is one of .html,
.htm, .xhtml, .shtml, .mhtml, .sgml, .xml, .xul, .xsd, .xsl,
.xslt, .wsdl, .dtd; it can be toggled from the Options <br>
menu. Additional highlighting of embedded server-side
scripting is activated if the file name suffix is one of
.jsp, .php, .asp, .aspx. <br>
HTML/XML syntax highlighting can be enabled with option +H
or using Preference configuration per file-type. <br>
HTML tag matching: With the ESC ( or ESC ) command, mined
searches for the opening / closing HTML tag corresponding to
the current one. <br>
Note: While you edit within a line and change its HTML
ending status (by entering or deleting &rsquo;&lt;&rsquo; or
&rsquo;&gt;&rsquo;), the display status of subsequent lines
is not changed. (You may refresh <br>
the display with ESC &quot;.&quot;) <br>
Configuration hint: The colour used for displaying HTML tags
can be configured with the environment variable MINEDHTML
using an ANSI sequence, e.g. MINEDHTML=34 (the default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Search structure match <br>
With the ESC ( or ESC ) commands, mined searches for a
matching end of various structures, like opening/closing
HTML/XML tags (see above), matching parentheses or brackets,
<br>
matching comments (/* */), matching conditional macros
(#if...), mail messages (in a mailbox file), MIME
attachments. See the ESC ( command in the command reference
for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Structure input <br>
A structure template with opening and closing ends can be
inserted with the structured input feature. HOP followed by
one of { , ( , [ , &lt; enters a corresponding bracket pair,
<br>
HOP / enters a Javadoc comment frame. HOP - enters an
underlining line matching the previous line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Visual structure input is
supported by Auto indentation</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Password hiding <br>
With the option -P, mined hides one word (separated by white
space) behind the string &quot;assword&quot; in a line (to
accommodate for &quot;password&quot; or
&quot;Password&quot;) and displays reverse &quot;*&quot;
<br>
instead. Password hiding can be disabled with +P. <br>
By default (without any P option), password hiding is
activated when editing a file whose file name starts with
&quot;.&quot; (Unix &quot;hidden&quot; file convention).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Virtual bold/underline stropping
<br>
With the option +ZZ, mined displays all-capital words in
bold lower-case and supports their input using only a first
capital letter, then small letters to input a word in all-
<br>
upper-case. This is to support editing computer programs in
Algol-like languages in their typical publication look. Use
+Z_ for underline stropping, disable with -ZZ. Enabled <br>
by default if the filename ends with &quot;.a68&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Long line splitting <br>
Mined has an internal line length limit (&gt; ca. 1024
characters). When opening a file, longer lines are split.
This is handled transparently as virtual &quot;none&quot;
line ends are used <br>
and indicated. When saving the file, lines will be joined
again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Visible indication of line
contents and display <br>
Various options are available to indicate line control
characters (Tab and line-feed) as well as shifted line
display (of lines longer than the screen width). (So you can
see <br>
how many dummy blank spaces there are before the line ends
or how many superfluous blank spaces precede a Tab
character.) <br>
Environment variables can be used to modify these
indications. See Display layout for details. <br>
Default indications and according configuration
variables:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&laquo; / &acirc; LF
(Unix-type line end) <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Configuration: Display colour of
the indications is by default red or a dimmed foreground
colour; this can be changed with the environment variable
MINEDDIM, display colour for <br>
Unicode line end indications and other special (esp.
invalid) character indications with &lt;span
class=env&gt;MINEDSPECIAL. Their values should be the
numeric part of an ANSI terminal <br>
control sequence, e.g. 31 for red, &quot;33;44&quot; for
yellow text on blue background. MINEDDIM can also be set to
an integer percentage value (e.g. MINEDIM=&quot;50%&quot;)
to have mined apply <br>
dim colour to the indications; the colour value is computed
from the current foreground and background colours (if the
terminal supports their detection). <br>
For more details and recommended settings see the example
script file profile.mined in the Mined runtime support
library. Default values are compiled in and can be
overridden by <br>
setting the variables to empty values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Function key help bars <br>
For quick reference of functions attached to function keys,
modified function keys, and other modified keys (as used for
accent prefix functions), a number of help bars can be <br>
displayed in the bottom line. <br>
F1 followed by another F1, optionally modified by a
combination of Control/Shift/Alt, displays a help line with
function attachments to the respectively modified function
keys; <br>
F1 followed by Ctrl-1/Alt-1/Alt-Ctrl-1 or Control with a
punctuation key (e.g. Ctrl-,) displays a help line for the
respective accent prefix functions attached. See the F1 help
<br>
bars command reference for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Menu display <br>
Menu borders are displayed using Unicode Box Drawing
characters in a UTF-8 terminal, using VT100-mode graphics
characters if they are detected to be available, or using
ASCII <br>
graphics otherwise. <br>
Configuration hint: The menu style option -Q is available to
configure your style preference; see also Terminal
interworking problems for configuration hints to deal
terminal- <br>
related graphics display trouble. Alternatively, the option
-f reduces font assumptions and adjusts usage of special
characters accordingly. <br>
In addition to round or rectangular corners, also fancy item
selection display style can be selected (-Q). <br>
With a non-UTF-8 terminal, if your system&rsquo;s
termcap/terminfo database does not indicate the VT100
graphics capability for the terminal you use but you know
(or want to try if) <br>
your terminal has that capability, use of graphical borders
can be enforced with the -Qv command line option. <br>
Configuration hint: The colour of menu borders can be
changed with the environment variable MINEDBORDER. The
marker of selected items in flag menus can be changed with
the envi&acirc; <br>
ronment variable MINEDMENUMARKER. <br>
&acirc;NEW&acirc; The apperance of the menu background and
borders can be configured in the runtime configuration file
$HOME/.minedrc.</p>

Mined supports a built-in input method for Greek. Select it
from the Input method menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Accented character input support
<br>
In combination with a Greek input method or keyboard, mined
provides accent prefix support for both monotonic Greek and
polytonic Greek. <br>
Monotonic Greek uses only one accent, the tonos which looks
like acute and can be entered with the F6 or Ctrl-&rsquo;
prefix function. <br>
Polytonic Greek uses - among many others - the oxia accent
which is nowadays considered identical and looks like the
monotonic tonos. However, for historic reasons, there are
two <br>
sets of Greek accented letters with this accent in Unicode,
one with tonos and one with oxia. While this may be
considered a design flaw of Unicode, in fact both kinds of
charac&acirc; <br>
ters exist and mined provides support for both accents. The
choice of usage is up to the user. Note, e.g. that</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">F6 &lt; alpha &gt; <br>
enters the Greek letter alpha with tonos</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ctrl-F6 &lt; alpha &gt; <br>
enters the Greek letter alpha with oxia</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Likewise, with mnemonic
input</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^V &rsquo; &lt; alpha &gt;
(using the apostrophe key) <br>
enters the Greek letter alpha with tonos</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^V &Acirc;&acute; &lt; alpha
&gt; (using the acute accent key)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In these examples, &lt; alpha
&gt; indicates the Greek letter alpha, which may e.g. be
entered by selecting the Greek input method and typing the a
key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Accent prefix functions for
Latin letters are reused for Greek accents, see the
following table:</p>

extension (extending CP950), GB18030 (extending CP936,
extending GKB, including EUC-CN), and CNS (EUC-TW)
multi-byte char&acirc; <br>
acter sets. To view and edit a file in one of these
encodings, select it from the Encoding menu (section
&quot;Chinese&quot;), or use the respective command line
parameter -EB or -EG or <br>
-EC. See Character encoding flags for details. <br>
Auto-detection: Big5 and GB18030 text encoding are also
auto-detected when opening a file (with a certain success
rate). Set the environment variable
MINEDDETECT=&quot;BG&quot; to con&acirc; <br>
strain auto-detection to Big5 and GB18030 encodings. See
Mined configuration for details. <br>
Terminal: Mined supports native CJK terminals; make sure to
indicate this properly with an environment variable (LC_* /
LANG). See Terminal encodings support for details on <br>
detection and handling of CJK terminal features.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Input method <br>
Mined provides the following built-in input methods for
Chinese: Pinyin, Cangjie, WuBi, 4Corner, Boshiamy, and
special support for a Radical/Stroke lookup input method.
Select <br>
the input method of your preference from the Input method
menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Han character information
display <br>
Mined provides special support for display of Han character
information according to the Unihan database. It comprises
semantic information and Mandarin, Cantonese, Hanyu Pinlu,
<br>
Hanyu Pinyin, XHC Hanyu pinyin, and Tang dynasty
pronunciation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Accented character input support
<br>
For Latin-based Pinyin transcription of Chinese, the usual
accent prefix functionality is available. &lt;!p&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Japanese <br>
Character sets <br>
In addition to Unicode, mined supports JIS character sets in
EUC-JP or Shift_JIS (CP932) multi-byte encoding
&acirc;NEW&acirc; and EUC-JIS-2004 (X 0213) or
Shift_JIS-2004 (X 0213) encoding. <br>
To view and edit a file in one of these encodings, select it
from the Encoding menu (section &quot;Japanese&quot;), or
use the respective command line parameter -EJ or -ES. See
Character <br>
encoding flags for details. <br>
Auto-detection: EUC-JP/-JIS and Shift_JIS text encodings are
also auto-detected when opening a file (with a certain
success rate). Set the environment variable
MINEDDETECT=&quot;JS&quot; <br>
to constrain auto-detection to EUC-JP and Shift_JIS
encodings, &acirc;NEW&acirc; or MINEDDETECT=&quot;Xx&quot;
to constrain auto-detection to EUC-JIS X 0213 and Shift_JIS
X 0213 encodings. See Mined <br>
configuration for details. <br>
Terminal: Mined supports native CJK terminals; make sure to
indicate this properly with an environment variable (LC_* /
LANG). See Terminal encodings support for details on <br>
detection and handling of CJK terminal features.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Input method <br>
Mined provides the following built-in input methods for
Japanese: Hiragana, Katakana, TUT roma, and special support
for a Radical/Stroke lookup input method. Select the input
<br>
method of your preference from the Input method menu. <br>
Mined does not implement, however, advanced Japanese input
methods that provide semantics-based Hanja input; for these,
you will have to set up or use an external input method <br>
with your operating environment, which is then handled by
the terminal which delivers ready-composed characters
transparently to the application.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Han character information
display <br>
Mined provides special support for display of Han character
information according to the Unihan database. It comprises
semantic information and Japanese and Sino-Japanese
pronun&acirc; <br>
ciation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Accented character input support
<br>
For Latin-based Romaji transcription of Japanese, the usual
accent prefix functionality is available. &lt;!p&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Korean <br>
Character sets <br>
In addition to Unicode, mined supports UHC (CP949, including
EUC-KR) and Johab multi-byte character sets. To view and
edit a file in one of these encodings, select it from the
<br>
Encoding menu (section &quot;Korean&quot;), or use the
respective command line parameter -EK or -EH. See Character
encoding flags for details. <br>
Auto-detection: UHC text encoding is also auto-detected when
opening a file (with a certain success rate). Set the
environment variable MINEDDETECT=&quot;K&quot; to constrain
auto-detec&acirc; <br>
tion to UHC encoding. See Mined configuration for details.
<br>
Terminal: Mined supports native CJK terminals; make sure to

<br>
&lt;!p&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Vietnamese <br>
Character sets <br>
In addition to Unicode, mined supports VISCII, TCVN and
&acirc;NEW&acirc; Windows Vietnamese (CP1258) character
sets. To view and edit a file in one of these encodings,
select it from the <br>
Encoding menu (section &quot;Vietnamese&quot;), or use the
respective command line parameter -EV or -EN. See Character
encoding flags for details. <br>
Auto-detection: VISCII text encoding is also auto-detected
when opening a file (with a certain success rate). Set the
environment variable MINEDDETECT=&quot;V&quot; to constrain
auto- <br>
detection to VISCII encoding. See Mined configuration for
details. <br>
Terminal: If your terminal runs this encoding, make sure to
indicate this properly with an environment variable (LC_* /
LANG). See Terminal environment for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Input method <br>
Mined provides the following built-in input methods for
Vietnamese: VNI and VIQR. Select the input method of your
preference from the Input method menu. <br>
It may be more convenient, however, to use the extensive
accented character input support provided by mined together
with a normal Latin-based keyboard (so without a keyboard-
<br>
mapping input method), see Character input support for
Vietnamese below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Character input support <br>
Mined provides input support for multiple accented
characters as used in Vietnamese, as well as convenient
accent prefix functions for combinations of two Vietnamese
accents. <br>
Modified Ctrl-/Alt-/Alt-Ctrl- digit keys are used for
Vietnamese accent prefix functions. Alternatively, mnemonic
character input can be used. See Accented and mnemonic input
<br>
support for details, and see below for some introducing
comments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An accent prefix can either be
applied to the plain Latin base letter, or to a precomposed
Vietnamese letter which already has one of the accents.
These are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">U+00C2 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A
WITH CIRCUMFLEX</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">U+00E2 LATIN SMALL LETTER A WITH
CIRCUMFLEX</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">U+00CA LATIN CAPITAL LETTER E
WITH CIRCUMFLEX</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">U+00EA LATIN SMALL LETTER E WITH
CIRCUMFLEX</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">U+00D4 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER O
WITH CIRCUMFLEX</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">U+00F4 LATIN SMALL LETTER O WITH
CIRCUMFLEX</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">U+0102 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A
WITH BREVE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">U+0103 LATIN SMALL LETTER A WITH
BREVE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">U+01A0 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER O
WITH HORN</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">U+01A1 LATIN SMALL LETTER O WITH
HORN</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">U+01AF LATIN CAPITAL LETTER U
WITH HORN</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">U+01B0 LATIN SMALL LETTER U WITH
HORN</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples: Suppose your keyboard
is mapped to have Vietnamese characters like A with
circumflex available. Then:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^V &Atilde; &rsquo; (Ctrl-V
A-circumflex apostrophe) <br>
enters the composite character U+1EA4 (A with circumflex and
acute)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^V ~ &Atilde; (Ctrl-V
O-circumflex tilde) <br>
enters the composite character U+1ED6 (O with circumflex and
tilde)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ctrl-6 A <br>
enters U+00C2 (A with circumflex)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alt-4 A <br>
enters U+1EAA (A with circumflex and tilde)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ctrl-Alt-3 A <br>
enters U+1EB2 (A with breve and hook above)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ctrl-Alt-3 O <br>
enters U+1EDE (O with horn and hook above)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: Using composite base
characters in mined character mnemonics or accent prefix
combinations as just described also works in non-UTF-8 text
encoding mode (e.g. in VISCII or <br>
TCVN encoding). &lt;!p&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Thai <br>
Character sets <br>
In addition to Unicode, mined supports the TIS-620 character
set (with CP874 extensions). To view and edit a file in this
encoding, select it from the Encoding menu (section <br>
&quot;Thai&quot;), or use the respective command line
parameter -ET. See Character encoding flags for details.
<br>
Terminal: If your terminal runs this encoding, make sure to
indicate this properly with an environment variable (LC_* /
LANG). See Terminal environment for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Input method <br>
Mined provides a built-in Thai input method. Select the
input method from the Input method menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Accented character input support
<br>
Not yet implemented. Tell me if you have a proposal or
preference for assignment of accent prefix functions to the
keyboard.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Character handling support <br>
This chapter describes mined features for character
manipulation and display of characters and character
properties. Unicode and CJK specific features are described
in the <br>
respective chapters. Character input support is described
separately in the subsequent chapter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Script highlighting <br>
It may be desirable to distinguish characters in different
script by displaying their glyphs in different colours.
(This especially allows to distinguish easier between
similar <br>
glyphs as they occur in Latin/Greek/Cyrillic scripts.) <br>
Script highlighting is currently pre-configured for Greek
and Cyrillic. It uses the terminal&rsquo;s 256-colour mode
if available. <br>
The scripts to highlight and the colour values to use can be
configured at compile-time. See Mined configuration
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Combining characters <br>
When editing text in Unicode or any encoding that contains
combining characters, mined supports display and editing of
combining and combined characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(Note: Terminal support for
combining characters is auto-detected; additional command
line options are available in case this fails.) <br>
If mined operates on a terminal that handles combining
characters, it offers two editing modes: combined or
separated. They can be toggled by clicking the Combining
display flag <br>
in the Quick Options (Mode indication) flags area (right
part of the top screen line), or by the menu entry
&quot;Options - Combined display&quot;; separated display
mode can also be <br>
selected by the command line option -c.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Combined display and editing
mode (Combining display flag &Atilde;&sect;) <br>
Combined characters are displayed as intended (i.e.,
combined).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Micro movement
into combined characters:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The cursor can
be moved into a combined character with Ctrl-cursor-left and
Ctrl-cursor-right, or ^V cursor-left and ^V
cursor-right.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; You can
determine the exact position of the cursor if permanent
character info is switched on (by HOP ESC u or with HOP
&quot;Toggle Char info&quot; in the Options menu).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Partially
editing combined characters:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If the cursor is
on a combined character, delete next character (e.g. Del on
small keypad) will delete the whole combined character, with
all combining accents.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If the cursor is
on a combined character, Ctrl-Del will delete only the base
character, leaving combining accents which may then be
combined with the previous char&acirc; <br>
acter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If the cursor is
within a combined character, delete next character will
delete the current combining accent only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Smart
backspacing: Ctrl-Backarrow or F5 Backarrow (&quot;Delete
single&quot;) behind or within a combined character will
only delete the rightmost combining accent (preceding <br>
the cursor position) while Backarrow would delete the whole
combined character. <br>
Note:&acirc;NEW&acirc; Configuration option plain_BS
(command line option +Bp) switches the Backarrow key from
smart backspacing to plain backspacing, i.e. no auto-undent
and <br>
only delete one combining character of a combined character.
Use Shift-Control-Backarrow to perform smart backspacing
then.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; You can also
position the cursor as described above and use
copy-and-paste operations. <br>
Note: Ctrl-cursor-left and Ctrl-cursor-right only work if
these keys are configured to emit distinguished escape
sequences with Control key held down. With xterm, this works
by <br>
default. With rxvt, use the small keypad cursor keys, or
enable Control on the right keypad with the sample
configuration file Xdefaults.mined in the Mined runtime
support <br>
library. With mlterm, enable this with the sample
configuration file mlterm/key in the Mined runtime support
library. Ctrl-Backarrow can also be configured to work with
xterm <br>
but doesn&rsquo;t appear to work with rxvt or mlterm, use F5
Backarrow instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Separated display and editing
mode (Combining display flag &lsquo;) <br>
Combined characters are separated into base character and
combining character(s) for display and editing. Combining
characters are indicated with coloured background.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; In separated
display mode, all cursor and text modification operations
work on the combining parts as displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Input support: For input of
Unicode combining characters, <br>
see Combining character input below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: Unicode combining
characters (according to the <br>
most recent version of Unicode known to mined) that are not
handled as combining characters by the terminal (which might
implement an older version of Unicode) are always <br>
displayed like in separated display mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: Isolated combining
characters, i.e. those <br>
appearing at a line beginning or after a TAB character, are
always displayed like in separated display mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Character information display
<br>
The command ESC u displays character encoding information in
the bottom status line (conforming to ISO 14755); it
displays the character code in the selected encoding (UTF-8
byte <br>
sequence in UTF-8 mode) and the ISO-10646 (Unicode) value of
the current character, as well as Unicode script range and
character category, width, and combining information. The
<br>
Unicode value is displayed with 4 hexadecimal digits if the
character is in the Unicode BMP (Basic Multilingual Plane,
16 bit), with 6 digits if it is a Unicode character outside
<br>
of the BMP, and 8 digits if it is an ISO-10646 character
outside of the Unicode range. The information displayed also
indicates all kinds of encoding irregularities. <br>
For the Unicode data version used for character properties
see the mined change log.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Permanent display of character
information is toggled with HOP ESC u or by selecting
&quot;Char info&quot; in the Info menu (or with HOP
&quot;Toggle Char info&quot; in the Options menu).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the Info menu, attributes
that are shown with the character information can be
selected: Unicode script name, Unicode character name,
&acirc;NEW&acirc; Unicode named sequence, Unicode <br>
character decomposition, list of input mnemonics. Note that
Unicode named sequence information only applies to a small
number of named sequences, otherwise normal character <br>
information is shown instead; also, it is only shown in
combined display mode, so normal information can be quickly
toggled by switching to separated display mode (middle-click
<br>
on &Atilde;&sect; flag).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Character information display
can be selected with the +?c command line parameter (see
parameter description for further options). To preselect
continuous character information <br>
display, append +?c to the environment variable MINEDOPT or
enable option &quot;display_charinfo&quot; in the runtime
configuration file $HOME/.minedrc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Han character information
display <br>
CJK-specific character information (semantic and
pronuciation hints) is described below in section Han
character information display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Character conversion features
<br>
Case conversion <br>
The case conversion functions (ESC C, HOP ESC C, F11, HOP
F11, Shift-F3) cover the full Unicode range. They also
handle special cases like Greek final sigma, optionally
Turkish <br>
&quot;i&quot;, case mapping to multiple characters, and
Lithuanian special conditions. Japanese characters are
toggled between Hiragana and Katakana by the same functions.
<br>
Shift-F3 cycles casing of a word between all small, title
case (beginning capital), and all capitals. It handles title
casing, using Unicode title case characters for the first
<br>
character when appropriate. For Japanese script, it toggles
the word between Hiragana and Katakana. <br>
The case mapping is based on the most recent Unicode version
compiled into mined (for the actual version see the mined
change log and the Options menu About command). It is <br>
applicable in all text encodings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Line end type conversion <br>
In the Options menu, a submenu &quot;Lineend type...&quot;
offers functions to convert the line end of the current line
to LF or CRLF, or to convert the line end type of all lines
that do <br>
not have a special line end to LF or CRLF.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Numeric conversion <br>
Commands are available to insert characters corresponding to
a hexadecimal character code or hexadecimal/octal/decimal
Unicode value contained in the text, to insert a respective
<br>
value corresponding to the current character, or to toggle
the preceding character and its hexadecimal Unicode value
(Alt-x). For details, see the section Code conversion in the
<br>
Command reference.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Numeric entity (HTML/URL)
conversion <br>
HTML numeric character entities (e.g. &amp;#x40; or
&amp;#64; for @) or URL escape notation (e.g. %20 for space,
%C3%86 for &Atilde;) can be converted into unescaped
characters. Use one of the <br>
Mnemonic character substitution commands (ESC _ or national
variants) described below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mnemonic conversion <br>
A character mnemonic at the cursor position can be replaced
with its associated character. Use one of the Mnemonic
character substitution commands (ESC _ or national variants)
<br>
described below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Encoding conversion support <br>
A special feature offers interactive conversion to or from
Unicode character encoding, see Encoding conversion support
in chapter Unicode support below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unicode Copy/Paste buffer <br>
The Copy/Paste buffer can be operated in Unicode mode in
which case it converts between text edited in different
character encodings. See Unicode Copy/Paste buffer
conversion <br>
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Smart quotes <br>
In Smart quotes mode, straight (double or single) quote
characters &Acirc;&laquo;&quot;&Acirc;&raquo; or
&Acirc;&laquo;&rsquo;&Acirc;&raquo; are automatically
substituted with an opening or closing typographic quotation
mark, depending on <br>
the text context, or an apostrophe where appropriate. Also,
an acute accent key enters a typographic apostrophe.
&acirc;NEW&acirc; Alt-&quot; or Alt-&rsquo; enter the
respective quotation marks of <br>
the previous or standby style (see below). <br>
Quote marks style selection:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Select the
quotation marks style to be applied from the Smart Quotes
selection menu (open with ESC Q or Alt-Q or right-click on
the smart quotes indication in the <br>
flags area in the top screen line).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; To toggle
between the current and the previous smart quotes style,
middle-click or double-click the smart quotes flag or select
&quot;standby&quot; from the menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&acirc;NEW&acirc; To select the smart quotes style suitable
for the current locale, select &quot;by locale&quot; from
the menu. This is also achieved with the configuration
option <br>
smart_quotes or the command line option -q. <br>
Quotation marks style can be preselected by either of the
mechanisms described below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The smart quotes left/right
selection algorithm considers both the text context and the
state (whether an open quote was inserted before) to
automatically support smart quotes <br>
also in CJK text, and to try to distinguish an apostrophe
from a quote mark. &acirc;NEW&acirc; At a line beginning,
always a left (opening) quotation mark is chosen, supporting
the habit in <br>
some languages to repeat opening quote marks for each new
paragraph inside a quotation. <br>
French quotation marks spacing is automatically applied
(using no-break space U+00A0) if French style has been
selected from the menu or by locale. <br>
A typographic apostrophe can also be inserted with HOP
&rsquo; (^G &rsquo;) or with HOP &Acirc;&acute; (acute
accent), regardless of smart quotes mode. In smart quotes
mode, a typographic apostrophe is <br>
also inserted on input of &Acirc;&acute; (acute accent).
<br>
Straight quotes or accent marks (&quot; &rsquo; &lsquo;
&Acirc;&acute;) can be inserted with mnemonic compose pairs
(^V ^ &quot; or ^V ^ &rsquo; or ^V ^ &lsquo; or ^V ^
&Acirc;&acute;, or ^V&quot;# or ^V&rsquo;# or ^V&lsquo;# or
^V&Acirc;&acute;# respectively). <br>
Smart quotes are applicable in all text encodings provided
the desired quote marks are contained in the selected
encoding.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a file is loaded, mined
tries to determine the applicable quotation marks style in
two ways: With file position memory (see File info: Memory
of file position and editing <br>
style parameters above), mined also remembers the last
selected smart quotes mode for the file. If that information
is not available, mined auto-detects existing quotation
marks <br>
in the file and adjusts its smart quotes mode accordingly.
The option -q overrides this detection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;NEW&acirc; With
command-line option -q alone, quotation marks style is
derived from locale information (environment variables
&acirc;NEW&acirc; LANGUAGE, TEXTLANG, LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE,
LANG), or <br>
from a locale value given with the option as -q=locale. For
some languages, two styles are predefined, using the primary
style as active smart quotes style, and the secondary or
<br>
alternate style as standby style, for quick toggling with a
middle mouse click on the Quotes flag (or using the standby
entry from the Quote marks menu). The active quote marks
<br>
style can also be derived explicitly from the locale with
the Quotes menu option &quot;by locale&quot;. <br>
Option +q exchanges primary and alternate quotation marks
style, setting the alternate style active. <br>
Without an option -q, the primary locale-derived quote marks
style is always set as standby style to be quickly
available. <br>
Note: Language-dependent quotations marks styles are
determined using the compile-time configuration file
quotes.cfg. See Quotation Marks Styles on the mined web site
for a <br>
listing. <br>
Note: Smart quotes style can also be preselected giving the
desired quotation marks directly, either as command line
option like -q=&quot;&Acirc;&laquo;&Acirc;&raquo;&quot; or
with the environment variable <br>
MINEDQUOTES (see under Environment configuration hints
below); this overrides both auto-detection and the
preference saved with the cursor position.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Smart text replacements:
apostrophe, smart dashes, arrows and glottal stop <br>
If smart quotes are active, some other smart input text
replacements are applied to respective characters being
entered. (Replacement of subsequent character input
sequences is <br>
suppressed during a repeat command entering multiple
characters.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-- if preceded by a Space
character: en dash (U+2013) <br>
otherwise: em dash (U+2014)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- or -TAB <br>
&acirc;NEW&acirc; if leading a line (only white space
before): en dash (U+2013)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- &acirc;NEW&acirc; if embedded
in spaces: minus sign (U+2212)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- if an adjacent character is in
the Hebrew script range: Hebrew hyphen mark Maqaf
(U+05BE)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;- leftwards arrow
(U+2190)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-&gt; rightwards arrow
(U+2192)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;&gt; left right arrow
(U+2194)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&acute; apostrophe
(U+2019 right single quotation mark)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo; glottal stop (U+02BB
modifier letter turned comma)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: &acirc;NEW&acirc; Mined
smartly avoids inappropriate placement of smart replacements
as well as double spaces by redundant combination of smart
spaces and explicitly entered spaces, so <br>
you can seamlessly type either &quot;bonjour&quot; or &quot;
bonjour &quot; to enter &Acirc;&laquo; bonjour
&Acirc;&raquo; with French quotes, or a -- b to enter an en
dash although a space is initially inserted after it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Character input support <br>
Some character input support features support international
scripts (especially with Keyboard Mapping and Input
Methods), others mainly address composite characters. For
the <br>
latter, it is useful to explain a few notions:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Combining character: <br>
A character (usually in Unicode) that is defined to combine
with the previous character into a combined character, to be
displayed as a single glyph (visual unit).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Combined character: <br>
The glyph combination of a Unicode character (base
character) with one or more Unicode combining
characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Composed character (or composite
character): <br>
A character that has one or more accents composed into it,
or is otherwise composed of components, like the ae
ligature, to be displayed as a single glyph. It can be a
<br>
single Unicode character or a Unicode combined character
consisting of a Unicode base character and one or two
Unicode combining characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Accented character (or diacritic
character): <br>
A special case of a composite character where a letter is
composed with one or more accents.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Compose key: <br>
A number of system and keyboard vendors have equipped their
keyboards with a &quot;Compose&quot; or &quot;Combine&quot;
key. This key - when configured and interpreted properly by
the operat&acirc; <br>
ing environment - produces a composed character which is
then provided as input to the application.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Accented and mnemonic input
support <br>
Function keys or character mnemonics can be used to enter
accented or other composite characters. (This is also known
as digraph function with some editors.) <br>
These character composition functions also work on the
prompt line. <br>
(Any composite character configured on your keyboard can of
course also be entered directly or using the Compose/Combine
key of your keyboard.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that mnemonic input and
accent prefix keys can be <br>
combined in flexible ways, e.g.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^V &rsquo; Ctrl-F6 e <br>
or</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">F6 ^V e ^ <br>
which both enter U+1EBF (e with circumflex and acute)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mnemonic input can be applied
recursively to compose a character <br>
for further composition, e.g.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^V &rsquo; ^V a e <br>
enters U+01FD (&Atilde;&brvbar; with acute)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Accent prefix keys can use an
already precomposed base <br>
character for further composition; if this does not match an
explicitly known mnemonic, the base character is decomposed
first to find a match, e.g.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">F6 &Atilde;&frac14; or</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">F5 &Atilde;&ordm; which both
enter U+01D8 (u with diaeresis and acute)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Up to three accent prefix keys
can be combined by entering <br>
them in sequence in order to compose characters with
multiple accents, e.g.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">F5 F6 u <br>
enters U+01D8 (u with diaeresis and acute)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ctrl-2 Ctrl-7 a <br>
enters U+1EB1 (a with grave and breve)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ctrl-- Ctrl-: u <br>
enters U+1E7B (u with macron and diaeresis)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ctrl-, Ctrl-( e <br>
enters U+1E1D (e with cedilla and breve)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alt-7 Ctrl-, &lt; alpha &gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alt-F6 Shift-F6 Ctrl-, &lt;
alpha &gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ctrl-&lt; Ctrl-&lsquo; Ctrl-,
&lt; alpha &gt; <br>
all enter U+1F82 (alpha with psili and varia and
ypogegrammeni) where &lt; alpha &gt; indicates the Greek
letter alpha, which may e.g. be entered by selecting the
Greek input <br>
method and typing the &quot;a&quot; key</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Accent prefix keys <br>
General notes on using keys with Control, Shift, Alt
modifiers: <br>
Especially for accented character input, mined makes use of
key combinations modified with Control, Shift, Alt, or a
combination of them. Some of these key combinations <br>
may be limited by local environment, especially the window
system, or may need extra configuration to be enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Hint on input of
Alt/Ctrl-modified function keys: These are often intercepted
by window systems for special functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Alt:
Alternatively to using the Alt key, the ESC key can be used
as a prefix to a function key to achieve the same modified
function, e.g. ESC F6 instead of <br>
Alt-F6. Note, however, that there is an ESCAPE delay
(default 450 ms) during which the subsequent function key
should be pressed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Control:
Alternatively to using the Control key, Ctrl-V can be used
as a prefix to a function key to achieve the same modified
function, e.g. Ctrl-V F6 <br>
instead of Ctrl-F6. <br>
Specific advice:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Window system <br>
suppresses <br>
remedy</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KDE Ctrl-Fn, Ctrl-Shift-Fn,
Alt-Fn <br>
press the &quot;Window key&quot; additionally at the same
time, e.g. Window-Alt-F6 or use ESC or Ctrl-V prefixes, e.g.
ESC F6 (be fast!), Ctrl-V Shift-F5</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gnome-wm <br>
Alt-F5 <br>
Window-Alt-F5 or ESC F5 (be fast!)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fvwm2 Alt-Fn <br>

or: configure (&quot;Tools - Configuration... - Keyboard

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Modified digit
keys (e.g. Alt-2) as well as Ctrl-modified punctuation keys
(e.g. Ctrl-;) are used as extended and intuitive accent
prefix keys. To enable them, <br>
either use a recent version of xterm (216) or configure them
with your terminal. <br>
Configuration instructions for older versions of xterm and
for rxvt can be found in the sample file Xdefaults.mined in
the Mined runtime support library.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Note: In rxvt,
Ctrl-modified and shifted punctuation keys (if enabled by
configuration following the hint above) interfere with ISO
14755 input mode of rxvt; if the <br>
following key is entered twice, that mode is aborted and the
modified punctuation key becomes effective as an accent
prefix in mined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Warning: The
Alt-F4 key combination should not accidently be hit as many
window managers use it to kill the terminal window!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: If your keyboard
assignment provides its own accent prefix keys (&quot;dead

corresponding spacing character which can then be <br>
used for the extended accent prefix functionality of mined;
e.g. hold Control, then press &Acirc;&acute; (acute key)
twice, to invoke the acute/oxia prefix function of
mined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: For combining multiple
accents, in most <br>
cases their order does not matter. As an exception, to
combine dot above and macron, enter prefix keys in this
order, as s macron and dot above will be interpreted as dot

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dot macron <br>
e.g. Ctrl-. Ctrl-- dot above and macron (on A or O)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">macron dot <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: For the sake of accepting
Ctrl-- <br>
intuitively both as an accent prefix for macron as well as
an accent modifier to place an accent below a letter, the
macron accent prefix combined with another accent pre&acirc;
<br>
fix key is also interpreted as applying that accent below.
As a workaround to ambiguous cases, it has to be applied
twice with diaeris for diaeresis below (U), and three <br>
times for line below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: Some accent prefix keys,

(extended to provide generic accent mnemonics for Unicode
<br>
characters), mnemonics known from HTML and TeX,
&acirc;NEW&acirc; groff glyphs (roff special characters),
and useful supplementary mnemonics. See Character Mnemos
reference on the mined web <br>

Supplementary character mnemonics are consistent with
generic RFC1345 mnemonics; scripts covered are Latin, Greek,
Cyrillic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Keyboard Mapping and Input
Methods <br>
Mined supports optional keyboard mapping which is especially
useful for Unicode or CJK editing. When a keyboard mapping
is selected, input characters or sequences are trans&acirc;
<br>
formed to other characters or sequences, typically of a
certain Unicode script range. <br>
Keyboard mappings for Greek, Cyrillic, Hebrew, Arabic, and
major CJK input methods are preconfigured (they have been
ordered in the Input Method menu according to the order of
<br>
their respective basic ranges in the Unicode character set,
or to the order of the letters of the usual abbreviation
CJKV for East Asian text processing - Chinese, Japanese,
<br>
Korean, Vietnamese). The Radical/Stroke input method
provides additional functionality as a special case. <br>
Mined provides compile-time configuration of additional
input methods; for this aim, further mappings can be
generated using the mkkbmap script (from tables in various
formats as <br>
used by other editors or supplied by the m17n
multilingualization package) and then compiled into mined.
See Mined configuration below for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Keyboard mapping works as
follows: You enter a key sequence that is mapped to a
character sequence in the selected keyboard mapping table.
The transformed character sequence is <br>
used as input. <br>
As some typical keyboard mappings contain ambigous key
sequences where one may be a prefix of another, a short
delay is applied in these cases to allow recognition of any
such <br>
sequence to be mapped. After a timeout, the shorter sequence
already matching will be used; the timeout can be cut short
by typing a Space key, the Space character itself will <br>
then be discarded. (The timeout value is 900 ms by default
and can be configured with the environment variable
MAPDELAY.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pick lists <br>
Some keyboard mappings, especially for CJK input methods,
contain multiple choice mappings. In these cases, a
selection menu is displayed that offers a &quot;pick
list&quot; to select a <br>
character from. A character can be picked with a mouse
click, or by navigation to the desired choice with the
cursor keys (down/up, right/left, page down/up) or the
&rsquo;&lt;&rsquo;/&rsquo;&gt;&rsquo; keys <br>
, or by just selecting the menu row first (cursor-up/down),
then typing a digit 1-9 or 0 to select the numbered
character. <br>
The Space key can be configured to either navigate to the
next choice, the next row, or to select the current choice;
see option -K. If the pick list is too large to fit on the
<br>
screen, the menu will be scrollable or pageable (using
cursor keys).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">While navigating through the
pick list, the line and the selected item in the line are
highlighted accordingly; if the current item is a CJK
character, also its character infor&acirc; <br>
mation (description and optionally pronunciations as
configured with the Han info option of the &rsquo;?&rsquo;
information flag menu) is displayed on the status line. If
the item is a word <br>
comprising multiple CJK characters, the information for only
the first of them is shown. The available information is
derived from the Unihan database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Keyboard mapping data are based
on Unicode. So in CJK text mode, the selection menu (the
pick list) may contain symbols that are not mapped to the
active CJK text encoding. In a <br>
UTF-8 terminal, these will still be displayed but cannot be
inserted. In a CJK terminal, some characters may not be
displayed; an empty entry is shown instead. (In a
non-Unicode, <br>
when editing text in a different encoding, there may even be
characters that cannot be displayed in the selection menu
but can be inserted.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Input method selection <br>
An active and a standby input method (keyboard mapping) are
maintained. They can be toggled quickly for text input, also
on the prompt line. <br>
The current mapping is indicated as the Input Method flag by
its two-letter script tag in the flags area, showing
&quot;--&quot; if no mapping is active.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The active mapping can be
selected in the following ways:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ESC k or Alt-k or Ctrl-Alt-F12
or left click on Input Method flag <br>
toggles between current (active) and previously selected
(standby) input method (keyboard mapping) <br>
(Alt- toggle functions also work on prompt line)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOP ESC k (or HOP Alt-k) <br>
clears input method, i.e. resets keyboard mapping to none
(unmapped input)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ESC I or Alt-I or ESC K or Alt-K
or Ctrl-F12 <br>
opens the Input Method (Keyboard Mapping) selection menu
<br>
(Alt-I or Alt-K or Ctrl-F12 also work on prompt line)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">right click on Input Method flag
<br>
opens the Input Method selection menu</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOP ESC K or HOP Alt-K <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If file position memory is
enabled (see File info: Memory of file position and editing

selected input method for the <br>
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: For preselecting the
active or standby input method by environment configuration,
see about usage of the environment variable MINEDKEYMAP
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: Keyboard mapping is
implicitly suppressed temporarily where it is not useful:

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Character encoding support <br>
A character encoding for interpretation and handling of text
is selected in one of the following ways:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Interactively
from the Encoding Menu (one of the flag menus), the encoding
interpretation can be changed while editing; to open it,
click with the right mouse but&acirc; <br>

auto-detection can be configured with the MINED&acirc; <br>
DETECT environment variable. Set it to the desired list of
single-letter encoding indications to disable auto-detection
of other encodings. Recognised encoding <br>
indications are mentioned in the list of auto-detected
encodings below (they are the same as used with the -E
parameter); UTF-8 auto-detection cannot be disabled <br>
this way.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; By either

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CJK and mapped 8 bit encoding
support <br>
Mined supports major CJK encodings as well as mapped 8 bit
encodings (&quot;character sets&quot;). Mined has built-in
support for a large number of 8 bit encodings which appear
to be in <br>
use or unique for a region. The Encoding menu has been
structured with submenus to provide a concise menu selection
feature.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;NEW&acirc; <br>
EBCDIC support Mined supports EBCDIC encoded files
(transparently transforming them for internal handling) in
the &quot;bracket&quot; codepage CP1047 as used by the UNIX
System Services <br>
(USS) on IBM z/OS. CP1047 is selected with command line
option -E=cp1047 or -E.EBCDIC or -E:47. The character
encoding flag indicates EBCDIC with &quot;47&quot;. <br>
New files in EBCDIC encoding will by default use Next Line
as line separators; add option -r to prefer LF. <br>
New lines can be added selecting LF or NL lineend type
explicitly with Ctrl-Enter or Shift-Enter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Combining characters <br>
In all character encodings handled by mined that contain
combining characters, mined handles them and provides
partial editing and an optional separated display mode as
described <br>
above in section Combining characters. (CJK encodings
EUC-JIS-2004, Shift_JIS-2004 and GB18030, Vietnamese TCVN
and Windows Vietnamese (CP1258), Thai TIS-620, ISO Arabic,
Mac <br>
Arabic, DOS Arabic, ISO Hebrew, Windows Hebrew). Handling of
combining text characters is properly coordinated with the
set of combining characters supported by the terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For Japanese X 0213 encodings,
the character codes that map to two Unicode characters are
supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Character code related commands
<br>
The command ESC u displays character encoding information in
the bottom status line (conforming to ISO 14755); this
includes the character code, the mapped Unicode character
<br>
value, and optionally script and character category
information, character and named sequence name, combining
and Unicode decomposition information, and mined mnemonic
input <br>
information, as configured in the Info menu. For CJK
characters, also Han pronunciation and description
information is available. See Character information display
for details. <br>
With HOP ESC u, permanent display is toggled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other commands insert the code
of the current character, insert a character taking its
character code or Unicode value from the text, or toggle the
preceding character and its <br>
hexadecimal Unicode value (Alt-x). For details, see Code
conversion in the Command reference.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Terminal environment for CJK
encoding support <br>
Mined supports handling of CJK text encoding in any terminal
(see Terminal encoding support below). However, proper
display of a wide range of CJK characters can obviously only
<br>
work in either a Unicode terminal (recommended) or in a
native CJK terminal that runs the same encoding as the
selected text encoding.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CJK terminals: For terminals
that support native CJK encodings (e.g. cxterm, kterm,
hanterm), the terminal encoding assumed by mined can be
specified with a command line option <br>
or by proper locale indication in one of the environment
variables LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE or LANG. For available encodings,
see Quick Options (Mode indication) flags. For usage of <br>
the +E options, see the description of the Terminal encoding
options above. For usage of the locale environment
variables, see Locale configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: In native CJK terminals,
it is often troublesome to find a working encoding
configuration and font setup, and the locale environment is
not automatically set by the termi&acirc; <br>
nals. A collection of wrapper scripts is available (
http://towo.net/mined/terminals.tar.gz) to help with this
setup problem and demonstrate the invocation of a number of
dif&acirc; <br>
ferent CJK and 8 bit encoded terminal windows, along with
selection of suitable fonts and proper locale environment
setting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: Native CJK terminals have
a different assumption of the range of character codes
supported in an encoding family, e.g. Big5 / Big5 with
HKSCS, GB2312 / GBK / GB18030, EUC- <br>
KR / UHC, EUC-JP without/with 3 byte codes. For compact
handling, mined always assumes the largest superset of these
encoding families. It does, however, have some features to
<br>
prevent display garbage in most cases when a terminal
supports a smaller character set: By default, mined does not
display the following CJK character codes in a native CJK
ter&acirc; <br>
minal, i.e. it displays a substitute indication for them
(see CJK character display above):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Unknown
characters: CJK characters that have no defined mapping to a
valid Unicode character. Use the +C option to override this
display suppression and enforce <br>
transparent display of unknown characters in a CJK
terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Invalid
characters: CJK characters that do not match the encoding
scheme (e.g. wrt. to specified byte ranges) of the selected
encoding. Use the +CC option to over&acirc; <br>
ride this display suppression and enforce transparent
display of invalid character codes in a CJK terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Extended
characters: CJK characters encoded with 3 or 4 bytes. Use
the +CCC option to override this display suppression and
enforce transparent display of extended <br>
character codes in a CJK terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Regardless of all these features
and options, it may not always be possible to prevent
display garbage, especially if the font used by the terminal
does not cover the needed <br>
character range. To avoid these problems in general, it is
recommended to use a Unicode terminal for editing CJK
encoded files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See also Terminal interworking
problems for special hints about certain terminals.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VT100 special graphics character
set display support <br>
&acirc;NEW&acirc; Mined can display and edit files
containing codes for VT100 line drawing graphics characters,
showing corresponding small letters as their respective
graphic symbol. This <br>
option can be toggled from the Options menu and will be
cleared also on an explicit screen redraw command (ESC
.).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unicode support <br>
Introduction: handling Unicode encodings <br>
Mined interprets UTF-8 which is a multi-byte character
encoding of the ISO-10646 character set, part of which is
also known as Unicode. When reading a file, it detects UTF-8
<br>
encoding automatically (unless overridden by explicitly
selecting a text encoding with a command line option -u or
-l or -E...). It can also edit UTF-16 encoded Unicode files
<br>
(UTF-16 can represent the complete 21 bit Unicode subset of
ISO-10646). UTF-16 big or little endian with or without BOM
(byte order mark U+FEFF) is auto-detected or can be <br>
selected with a command-line option (see notes under Locale
configuration below). <br>
UTF-16 is maintained transparently, i.e. a UTF-16 encoded
file is written back in UTF-16, and if it was beginning with
a BOM this is maintained. No explicit UTF-16 entry exists,
<br>
however, in the Encoding menu since the text is internally
handled in UTF-8. However, the character encoding flag
indicates UTF-16 file encoding with either &quot;16&quot;
(big endian) or <br>
&quot;61&quot; (little endian).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UTF-8 internal representation,
transparent handling of other text <br>
Mined handles UTF-8 representation internally and also edits
and keeps illegal UTF-8 sequences. This way, if you happen
to open a Latin-1 or CJK or any other encoded file in <br>
UTF-8 mode, or switch encoding while editing, or edit a file
with mixed encoding, the text contents can still be edited
and you will not loose any file contents information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Character encoding indication
<br>
The upper-right flags area has a character encoding
indication which shows &quot;U8&quot; if UTF-8 text
interpretation is selected. For Latin-1 text interpretation
&quot;L1&quot; is shown, for oth&acirc; <br>
ers see Quick Options (Mode indication) flags. You may click
on the indication flag to toggle between the current and the
previous selected encoding.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Character information display
<br>
The Character information display command ESC u is described
above; character information display can also be preselected
by environment configuration. In UTF-8 mode, informa&acirc;
<br>
tion shown includes the UTF-8 encoding byte sequence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Character input support <br>
With ^V, mined&rsquo;s special character input support is
invoked (both while editing text and entering text on the
prompt line, e.g. as a search expression). With this
feature, (in <br>
addition to plain control characters) a composite character
can be entered by its accent combination or other mnemonic
character description; a more-than-two letter character <br>
mnemonics would be embedded in space characters after the
^V. In addition, numeric character codes or values can be
entered with leading ^V#, octal/decimal with ^V##/^V#=,
Uni&acirc; <br>
code with optional u/U/+. (For examples, see description of
the ^V function below.) With numeric character input, mined
supports successive multiple character entry according <br>
to ISO 14755; if the numeric code is terminated by a Space
key, another numeric character can be entered subsequently;
an Enter key terminates numeric character input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See also the generic section
Character input support above for input support for accented
characters and keyboard mapping.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Encoding conversion support <br>
Two functions support interactive character encoding
conversion (Latin-1 to UTF-8 or UTF-8 to current encoding)
to partially fix files with mixed encoding. In either text
encod&acirc; <br>
ing mode, the search function looks for characters encoded
in UTF-8 (when not editing in UTF-8 mode) or not (when
editing in UTF-8 mode); the command is HOP ESC ( or Alt-F11
. <br>
Then, convert the character with ESC _ or its national
variant (see mnemonic character substitution commands in the
Command reference). <br>
For repeated interactive conversion, both functions can be
combined into Alt-Shift-F11 (convert current character, then
search next).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unicode Copy/Paste buffer
conversion <br>
For the Copy/Paste buffer, Unicode mode can be selected
which maintains its contents always in Unicode, so that
Copy/Paste of text works between differently encoded files
(or <br>
sections of a file, if encoding is switched while editing)
with automatic character code conversion. This mode is only
effective while editing with non-Unicode encoded text <br>
interpretation. <br>
Select this mode with the command line option -Eu or in the
Paste buffer menu (righ-click on the Buffer mode flag
&quot;=&quot; or &quot;+&quot;) and select
&quot;Unicode&quot;. <br>
Unicode buffer mode is indicated by cyan background of the
Paste buffer flag (then &quot;=&quot; or &quot;+&quot;),
except in Unicode text mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Smart quotes and dashes <br>
If smart quotes mode is enabled (see the Quotes style menu
under the Quotes flag left to the Encoding flag and menu),
quote mark keys will enter typographic smart quotes instead.
<br>
Smart dashes also apply. See Smart quotes above for more
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bidirectional terminal support
<br>
A bidirectional terminal (such as mlterm) will probably also
apply Arabic LAM/ALEF ligature joining. Mined auto-detects
this feature and enables bidi terminal handling
automati&acirc; <br>
cally. Otherwise, bidi terminal handling can be configured
with the option +UU. <br>
In this mode, when displaying a menu, underlying text lines
that contain right-to-left characters are cleared first in
order to prevent display confusion between the
terminal&rsquo;s <br>
bidi algorithm and the menu position. <br>
Also, with bidi terminal handling enabled, mined assumes
that the terminal applies Arabic LAM/ALEF ligature joining
and properly accounts for this feature in display position
<br>
handling. <br>
In separated display mode, the joining part of the ligature
is indicated similar to the handling of combining
characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Input support for right-to-left
scripts (&quot;poor man&rsquo;s bidi&quot; mode) <br>
This support feature for input of right-to-left text pieces
is enabled by default unless the terminal is detected to be
in bidi mode itself (e.g. mlterm). <br>
&quot;Poor man&rsquo;s bidi&quot; mode is suitable to insert
small pieces of right-to-left text (words, phrases) within
left-to-right text, it stores right-to-left text in visual
order (see <br>
below) and works as follows: <br>
After entering a right-to-left Unicode character, the cursor
position is moved left of it, so subsequent characters will
be appended left and the text shifted right. Characters <br>
are stored in visual order while input support is implicit,
based on the characters being typed. Entering a
left-to-right character will automatically skip behind the
previously <br>
entered right-to-left text on the line and switch to
left-to-right direction; this behaviour optimizes inserting
small pieces of right-to-left text into basically
left-to-right <br>
text; this priority is justified by the assumption that this
mode (with visual storing order) is only useful for
inserting small right-to-left quotations into left-to-right
text <br>
and not for editing right-to-left documents (which should be
stored in logical order). <br>
Newline, Space, Tab, and combining characters attempt to
behave well according to what was entered before; however,
intermediate cursor movement is not considered. <br>
Note: For proper support of right-to-left text editing
stored in logical order, please use mined in a right-to-left
terminal (mintty, mlterm). Adding a feature for advanced
bidi <br>
support in all terminals is being considered. <br>
Note: Poor man&rsquo;s bidi mode also works in non-Unicode
text encodings. <br>
Note: Poor man&rsquo;s bidi mode is similar to the
&quot;revins&quot; (reverse insert) option of vim.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unicode line ends <br>
Mined detects and handles Unicode line separators and
paragraph separators (unless disabled with +u-u). They are
displayed as shown above. Interpretation of these characters
as <br>
line ends is disabled if a file is explicitly opened in
non-Unicode encoding (but not if non-Unicode encoding is
just auto-detected). <br>
If editing Unicode text, HOP Enter will insert a Unicode
paragraph separator, Enter in a line that already has a
Unicode line end will insert a Unicode line separator. Also,
the <br>
keys Shift-Enter or Ctrl-Enter insert a paragraph separator
or line separator respectively. <br>
Configuration: In order to enable shift and control with the
Enter keys, xterm or rxvt must be configured as shown in the
example configuration file Xdefaults.mined in the Mined <br>
runtime support library.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unicode display <br>
In UTF-8 terminal mode, mined displays all Unicode
characters if they are contained in the font used by the
terminal. Fonts usually have a substitute glyph to indicate
charac&acirc; <br>
ters not contained in the font. Wide characters
(double-width glyphs) are displayed in a double-width
character cell of the terminal. Combining characters are
displayed either <br>
combined or separated (see Combining characters below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Illegal UTF-8 sequences are
displayed with highlighted background, using the following
indications. Furthermore, control characters encoded as a
UTF-8 sequence and control char&acirc; <br>
acters in the &quot;C1&quot; range (values 0x80..0x9F) will
be displayed similar to normal control characters but with
coloured highlighting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">8 for an unexpected UTF-8
continuation byte (range 80-BF)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4 for a 0xFE (254) byte</p>

(00..7F)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&raquo; for a too short
UTF-8 sequence if followed by a multi-byte character
(C0..FF)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Illegal or non-Unicode
characters are indicated with the following
replacements:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&iuml;&iquest;&frac12; (or ? or

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 ..9 , <br>
A ..Z etc a corresponding fullwidth ASCII character</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Configuration: Display colour of
special or illegal UTF-8 indications can be changed with the
environment variable MINEDUNI, the value should be the
numeric part of an ANSI ter&acirc; <br>
minal control sequence; optionally, the value can be
preceded by a character to be used for Unicode character
indication in non-Unicode terminal mode. <br>
(The default configuration value is &quot;&Acirc;&curren;
46&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Combining and joining characters
<br>
Mined supports handling of combining characters, featuring
optional separate display and partial editing, as described
above in section Combining characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Joining characters <br>
If mined assumes that the terminal applies LAM/ALEF ligature
joining (either configured with the +UU right-to-left
display option or auto-detected; correct native support is
<br>
known of mlterm), the joined character width will be handled
correctly in cooperation with the terminal. In all other
terminals mined will apply LAM/ALEF joining itself. <br>
Mined supports ligature joining in both combining character
display modes:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; In combined
display mode, the screen position is accounted properly.
Also, when deleting a character, a joined ligature is
deleted together with the base charac&acirc; <br>
ter, just like combining characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; In separated
display mode, the joining part of the ligature is indicated
using the appropriate isolated form, highlighted with
Unicode special indication background <br>
colour (similar to the handling of combining
characters).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Search expression limitations
<br>
Unicode search ranges can not be very large as all included
characters are listed in an internal buffer which is limited
to ca. 1 KB.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UTF-8 preservation and
byte-transparent editing <br>
When splitting lines that are too long for internal
handling, consistency of UTF-8 sequences is preserved (they
are not split); combining characters may get split off their
base <br>
characters, however, they will join seemlessly as lines are
joined again (e.g. when saving the file). Note that isolated
combining characters, e.g. at the beginning of a line, <br>
are always displayed as if in separated display mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Terminal environment <br>
Unicode text can be edited in any terminal encoding (UTF-8,
8 bit, CJK), however, a UTF-8 terminal is preferable. UTF-8
terminal operation can be configured in either of these <br>
ways:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Auto-detection:
If the terminal emits cursor position reports, mined can
uniquely recognise UTF-8 terminal encoding and further UTF-8
features (see Terminal encod&acirc; <br>
ing support below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Environment: By
proper environment variable settings. For more details, see
Locale configuration. <br>
Note: In general, it is advisable to start a terminal window
using a wrapper script that sets a suitable locale
environment at the same time, in order to support <br>
all kinds of applications that are more dependent on proper
environment setting than mined is. The mined installation
also provides the script uterm for this pur&acirc; <br>
pose, with its own manual page. (In case uterm is not
installed, it is also included in the Mined runtime support
library.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Parameter: +EU

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See also Terminal interworking
<br>
problems for special hints about certain terminals.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CJK support
(Chinese/Japanese/Korean Han character features) <br>
Mined provides CJK support features uniformly in Unicode and
in major CJK encodings. For information relating to CJK
character encoding see Character encoding support below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CJK input method support <br>
Input methods for CJK characters are supported with the
keyboard mapping feature. A number of popular input methods
for CJK text input are pre-configured, others can be added
at <br>
compile-time with the mkkbmap script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Radical/Stroke input method <br>
Mined provides a Radical/Stroke input method for CJK
characters with specific functionality in addition to
keyboard mapping; it works at two-levels, selecting a
radical first, <br>
then a character from a list sorted by stroke count. If this
input method is active, a selection menu for the 214 CJK
radicals is displayed (without prior keyboard input). The
<br>
menu displays all variations of each radical. After
selecting a radical from this menu, a second-level menu is
displayed, showing all CJK characters based on the selected
radi&acirc; <br>
cal, sorted by the number of strokes. Many of these menus
will not fit on the screen and can be scrolled. Pressing
Escape here would return to the radical menu; pressing
Escape <br>
there would disable the input method. To enter a non-mapped
character (e.g. a line end), you need to disable
Radical/Stroke input method temporarily; just toggle it back
on with <br>
Alt-k (or Esc k) or Ctrl-Alt-F12 and the radical menu will
be displayed again for continued input. <br>
For the Unicode version used as the character data source,
see the Options - About information or the mined change
log.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CJK character display <br>
Combining characters (in both JIS X 0213 encodings and
GB18030) are handled and the combined characters are
displayed properly in either combined or separated display
mode in a <br>
UTF-8 terminal (like for UTF-8 encoded text). The following
special CJK character indications apply:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&curren; or
&Acirc;&curren; CJK character that cannot be displayed in
the terminal</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% or % (if the terminal cannot
display &Acirc;&curren;) CJK character that cannot be
displayed in the terminal</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo; or &lsquo; CJK combining

(to enforce display on CJK terminal use option +CC)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># CJK character in extended code

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt; incomplete or otherwise

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Han character information
display <br>
When the cursor is on a Han character and either descriptive
or pronunciation information about this character is
available in the Unihan database (from unicode.org), mined
can <br>
optionally display this information, with a selection of
display details which may include semantic information and
various pronunciations. <br>
To enable Han info, select it in the Info menu. To open the
Info menu, type Alt-F10 or right-click the &quot;?&quot;
flag. The information can optionally be shown on the status
line <br>
(where it may be truncated if too long) or in a pop-up menu
next to the character. <br>
Pronunciation information to be displayed can be selected in
the Info menu. While selecting multiple pronunciation
options, the menu stays open.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The same information is always
shown while you are browsing an input method pick list (then
on the status line).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Han character information
display can be selected with the +?h command line parameter
(or +?x for short display on the status line). To preselect
continuous Han character infor&acirc; <br>
mation display, append this parameter to the environment
variable MINEDOPT.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The information includes the
character code (in CJK encoding, both CJK code and
corresponding Unicode value are shown). The amount of
descriptive information (from the Unihan <br>
database) to be shown can also be preconfigured with the
environment variable MINEDHANINFO; see Han info
configuration below. <br>
(For the Unicode version used for the Unihan data source,
see the Options - About information or the mined change
log.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Terminal encoding support <br>
Mined supports UTF-8 terminals, CJK terminals, Latin-1 and
other 8-bit encoded terminals.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Terminal feature detection <br>
Mined performs auto-detection of a number of terminal
features:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; For UTF-8
terminals, mined performs auto-detection of terminal
features (detection of UTF-8 terminal, different width data
and combining data versions, handling of <br>
double-width, combining and joining characters).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; For CJK
terminals, mined performs some auto-detection of specific
CJK terminal features (handling of non-EUC code points,
handling of extended code range, GB18030, <br>
3-byte and 4-byte encodings, detection of kterm JIS
encoding, detection of rxvt emulating CJK encoded terminal,
special CJK width properties, and terminal support <br>
of combining characters).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; For mapped 8-bit
terminals, mined performs auto-detection of terminal support
of combining characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; For the Unicode
version used for width and combining character properties,
see the Options - About information or the mined change
log.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; CJK terminals
cannot always be distinguished from 8-bit terminals by
auto-detection. Neither can the encoding of either CJK or
8-bit terminals be auto-detected. It <br>
is thus advisable to setup proper settings of locale
environment variables (LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE, LANG).
Alternatively, the effective terminal encoding can be
indi&acirc; <br>
cated to mined with a command line option (+EX). For
configuration details, see Locale configuration below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specific terminal properties
<br>
For more specific configuration hints (especially for
PC-based terminals), see the Terminal environment
configuration hints below. <br>

listing of Terminal interworking problems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mined Command reference (command
and key function assignments) <br>
General note on using keys with Control, Shift, Alt
modifiers: Mined makes use of many key combinations modified
with Control, Shift, Alt, or a combination of them, as a
<br>
resource for invoking a larger number of specific functions,
providing modified functionality as well as accented
character input support. Some of these key combinations <br>
may be limited by local environment, especially the window
system, or may need extra configuration to be enabled. <br>
Especially modified function keys are often intercepted by
window systems for special functions. <br>
In general, mined interprets an ESC prefix as an alternative
for an Alt-key combination. For further advice and window
system specific hints on further remedies, as well <br>
as configuration hints, to enable modified key input see the
hint box under Accent prefix keys above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Generic command modifiers (esp.
HOP key) <br>
^Q or ^G or &quot;5&quot; (on keypad) or Menu (in Linux) or
* (on keypad) or Shift-TAB <br>
HOP key (except ^G followed by a digit). <br>
In order to enable the &quot;5&quot; key to invoke the HOP
function, or assign the HOP function to another key (e.g. on
laptops which lack the numeric keypad), some configuration
<br>
may be necessary; see Keypad configuration below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ESC Prefix for subsequent
&quot;letter commands&quot;. <br>

Note on the Home and End keys <br>
Sometimes people expect the &quot;Home&quot; and
&quot;End&quot; keys to move the cursor to the beginning or
end of line, respectively. In the keyboard usage approach of
mined, these func&acirc; <br>
tions can easily and quite intuitively be invoked with
&quot;HOP left&quot; and &quot;HOP right&quot;, i.e. by
pressing the keypad keys &quot;5 4&quot; or &quot;5 6&quot;
in sequence. So there is enough room <br>
left for mapping the most frequent paste-buffer functions to
the keypad as described above which is considered much more
useful. Use Ctrl-Home and Ctrl-End for the line <br>
positioning functions, depending on terminal support and
configuration; or use the -k option if preferred to switch
keypad key function assignments for the Home and End <br>
keys. See Keypad layout above for a motivating overview of
the mined keypad assignment features and options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Backarrow or ^H <br>
Dual-mode function: <br>
If a visual selection is active: Cut selected area to paste
buffer. <br>
Otherwise: Delete character left. <br>
Smart backspacing: If there is only blank space before the
current position in the current line and the line above and
auto-indentation is enabled, the auto-undent func&acirc;
<br>
tion (Back-Tab) is performed instead, deleting multiple
spaces back to the previous level of indentation. Note:
Mined tries to map this function to the Backarrow key on
<br>
the keyboard whether it is assigned to the Backspace or DEL
control characters, by inspecting the setting of the
terminal interface, see Automatic backspace mode
adapta&acirc; <br>
tion. Note:&acirc;NEW&acirc; Configuration option plain_BS
(command line option +Bp) switches the Backarrow key from
smart backspacing to plain backspacing, i.e. no auto-undent
and <br>
only delete one combining character of a combined character.
Use Shift-Control-Backarrow to perform smart backspacing
then.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ctrl-Backarrow (if key properly
configured) or F5 Backarrow <br>
&quot;Delete single&quot;: Delete only right-most combining

Dual-mode function: <br>
If a visual selection is active: Cut selected area to paste
buffer. <br>
Otherwise: Delete next character right, including any
combining characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ctrl-Del (on keypads, if key
properly configured) <br>
Delete character right, excluding any combining

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Shift-F3 <br>
Cycle casing of a word between all small, title case, and
all capitals (title case means the first letter is either
capital or actually a Unicode title case, the following <br>
letters are small). For Japanese script, it toggles the word
between Hiragana and Katakana.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mnemonic and special conversion
<br>
ESC _ or Ctrl-F11 <br>
Mnemonic character substitution replaces the two characters
at the cursor position with a suitable composite character
(e.g. accented character) if possible. With Ctrl- <br>
F11, transformations are the same as with the ^V two-letter
character input mnemonics. With ESC _, language-dependent
preferences may take precedence (see variations <br>
below) according to the current locale environment. <br>
Example: ae &acirc; &Atilde;&brvbar;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Special conversion features <br>
&Acirc;&middot; If the text at the cursor position contains
an HTML character tag (starting with &quot;&amp;&quot; and
optionally ending with &quot;;&quot;), it is replaced with
the actual character it <br>
represents. <br>
Example: &amp;not; &acirc; &Acirc;&not;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If the text at
the cursor position contains an HTML numeric character
entity (starting with &quot;&amp;#&quot; and optionally
ending with &quot;;&quot;), it is replaced with the
respective <br>
character it denotes. <br>
Example: &amp;#x40; &acirc; @ <br>
&amp;#64; &acirc; @</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If the text at
the cursor position contains a URL numeric escape notation
(starting with &quot;%&quot;) it is replaced with the actual
character it represents. <br>
Example: %40 &acirc; @ <br>
%C3%86 &acirc; &Atilde; (while in UTF-8 text encoding)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The command also
transforms between Latin-1 and UTF-8 encoded characters if
an accordingly encoded character is found at the current
position; the current character <br>
encoding mode is used to determine the target character set.
<br>
Example: &Atilde;&brvbar; (Latin-1 encoding) &acirc;
&Atilde;&brvbar; (current UTF-8 encoding) or <br>
&Atilde;&brvbar; (UTF-8 encoding) &acirc; &Atilde;&brvbar;
(current encoding)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As variations of ESC _, there
are some commands ESC LETTER using national letters that
occur on respective national keyboards. They apply basically
the same transformations but <br>
with some national preferences taking precedence:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ESC &Atilde;&curren; or ESC
&Atilde;&para; or ESC &Atilde;&frac14; or ESC &Atilde; <br>

&Atilde;&cedil;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;NEW&acirc; ESC
&Atilde;&not; or ESC &Atilde;&sup2; <br>
Similar to ESC _, but with Italian accent preferences
(&Atilde;&uml; rather than &Atilde;&copy;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;NEW&acirc; ESC &lt;
accented letter typical on East European keyboard &gt; <br>
(like l with stroke, u with ring, o with double acute, s
with caron, etc) Similar to ESC _, but with East European

(like n with tilde, g with breve, dotless i) Like ESC _.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Encoding conversion <br>
HOP ESC ( or Alt-F11 <br>
Search for a character encoded in the &quot;wrong

mode, or a Latin-1 character in UTF-8 text mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ESC _ or ESC &Atilde;&para; etc.
<br>
If invoked on a non-ASCII character, UTF-8 / non-UTF-8
character encoding conversion is applied: If the character
is not encoded in the current text encoding it is con&acirc;
<br>
verted into the current text encoding (from UTF-8 or from
Latin-1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alt-Shift-F11 <br>
Convert Latin-1 / UTF-8, then search for the next
&quot;wrong encoded&quot; character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Paragraph formatting <br>
ESC j (&quot;Clever Justify&quot;) Format paragraph by
word-wrapping according to the currently set right margin
value; left margins are derived from the contents of the
paragraph and <br>
line. Heuristic detection of numbered items automatically
triggers appropriate indentation. <br>
End-of-paragraph is a line without trailing blank space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">... with HOP: <br>
Same, but end-of-paragraph is considered to be a blank
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ESC J (&quot;Normal

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HTML support <br>
ESC H (every first time) <br>
Enter HTML tag (and remember for subsequent ESC H). (Note
that Alt-Shift-H will do the same thing if your terminal is
configured appropriately - see the example configu&acirc;

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ESC t or Alt-t or HOP Shift-F8
<br>
Search for and move to the location of the definition of
identifier at the current cursor position. This command uses
the tags file that can be generated with the ctags <br>
command (Unix). It opens another file if necessary and
automatically saves the current file then. <br>
On an include statement (line beginning with
&quot;include&quot; or &quot;#include&quot;), the command
opens the included file. <br>
Like with a number of positioning commands, ESC t places the
current position on the position marker stack before going
to the location of the identifier definition. The <br>
command ESC Enter (Alt-Enter) can move back to that
position, even if edited files were changed with the

The mined distribution provides a collection of runtime
support files (in subdirectory usrshare); if mined is
installed into standard locations, they are copied to one of
the <br>
directories /usr/share/mined, /usr/share/lib/mined,
/usr/local/share/mined, /opt/mined/share,
$HOME/opt/mined/share (depending on operating system and

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PC versions <br>
For Windows with a cygwin system (http://cygwin.com/), mined
is available as a cygwin package. <br>
Two other versions are available for DOS/Windows
systems:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Stand-alone
Windows version, compiled with cygwin. It runs in a Windows
console, Windows terminal (e.g. mintty), or X terminal. It
is packaged together with <br>
mintty. Its installation registers its invocation (in
mintty) from the Windows context menu for text files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; DOS version,
compiled with djgpp. It runs on plain DOS (with some special
support of FreeDOS codepage configuration) or in a Windows
console window (DOS command <br>
window) but not in a typical terminal application like
mintty or xterm. It supports long file names in Windows
98/2000/XP/... (not NT4.0). <br>
See the mined web site http://towo.net/mined/ for
download.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For hints on PC-specific
terminal configuration issues, see PC terminals below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VMS version <br>
Mined runs on OpenVMS, with a number of specific adaptations
especially in file handling.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Options
containing capital letters need to be quoted, e.g. MINED
&quot;-Qa&quot; [-]*.com. Mined options can also be passed
in the symbol MINED$OPT.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Filename
wildcard expansion is applied, accepting both Unix-like and
VMS-native subdirectory notations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; File versions
can optionally be specified and are handled properly; for
example, an explicit version opened for editing can be saved
and will be the most recent <br>
version as expected. <br>
Note: To combine wildcards with version specifications, use
VMS-native pathname notation (and do not use a final
&quot;;&quot; without version specification), e.g.: []x*;*
to <br>
edit all versions of all files x* [.cmd]x*;1 to edit version
1 of all files cmd/x*</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The file chooser
accepts Unix-like or VMS-style directory notations for
navigation. Switching to the current directory (TAB or
Enter) which is the first entry of <br>
the file chooser list, displayed in VMS style, turns the
file list into VMS-style listing of all file versions. <br>
Logical names can be used for direct navigation if a final
&quot;:&quot; is included (like SYS$LOGIN:).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Note that
opening the file chooser may be slow on large
directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If the terminal
window is resized while mined is running, mined will notice
and adjust after an explicit refresh (ESC .). The system,
however, is not notified of <br>
the changed window size in this case. Please resize (again)
when back on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The capability
to accept terminal copy-paste is limited by the VMS 80
character input buffer (not limited on emulated VMS, e.g. on
&quot;Personal Alpha&quot;). For some <br>
remote terminals (mintty, rxvt), full Unicode data version
detection is disabled to reduce start-up delay.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The file info
memory files are called .$mined instead of .@mined, recovery
files are called $name$ instead of #name#.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; In the VAX
version, CJK character encodings, Han character information,
and Unicode character information tables are not included by
default. Alpha and IA64 ver&acirc; <br>
sions include all Unicode and character encoding
features.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; For hints
related to the DECterm window, see below. <br>
See the template script MINED-VMS.COM in the conf_user
subdirectory of the Mined runtime support library or the
file README.vms (MINED.README in the VMS binary package) for
<br>
installation hints.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Android version <br>
There are a number of deviations from typical Linux systems;
mined provides workarounds where necessary. Mined runs on
Android with these Apps installed:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; C4droid (needed
as container for gcc)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; GCC for C4droid
(to compile mined)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Better Terminal
(recommended, for shell and terminal)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; UniversalAndroot
(to access gcc from terminal shell) for Android &lt; 4</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Terminal environment <br>
For terminal-specific hints, see Terminal interworking
problems below</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On Unix, the terminal type is
determined from the environment variable TERM. The
termcap/terminfo mechanism is used to derive the actual
properties of the terminal; for some ter&acirc; <br>
minals (cygwin, xterm, rxvt, vt*), this information is also
built-in as a fallback in case terminal information is not
available on a system (this is especially useful for the
<br>
cygwin stand-alone version).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Recognition of some special
terminal features or restrictions is associated with the
setting of TERM (xterm, linux, vt100, sun*, cygwin, rxvt,
*ansi*, 9780*, hp*, xterm-hp, <br>
superbee*, sb*, microb*, scoansi*, xterm-sco, cons*,
att605-pc, ti_ansi, mgterm). Non-trivial screen features
(like scroll reverse, add/delete line, erase multiple
characters) <br>
are used if their support is indicated in the
termcap/terminfo description of the terminal unless other
information is available (e.g. after terminal version
detection, an older <br>
xterm is supposed not to support erase characters). Since
colour support is often not configured within terminfo but
modern terminals do support it, mined always tries to apply
<br>
colour attributes (if the terminal at least supports ANSI
control sequences). A number of other &quot;best
practice&quot; approaches are taken to optimize the usage of
terminal capabili&acirc; <br>
ties, esp. covering different methods of graphics display
support (for menu borders).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For detection of function keys
and cursor keys, the escape sequences being used by
terminals are often not known to an operating system
environment because they are poorly and <br>
incompletely configured. Because this does usually not work
as expected (see this bug report just for an example), mined
does not rely on the termcap/terminfo configuration of <br>
function key codes alone (which it considers however since
mined 2000.14); rather it always accepts a wide variety of
typical codes. A few ambiguous codes are resolved according
<br>
to the TERM variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In an xterm, window headline and
icon text are set to the current filename and
&quot;(*)&quot; is added if the text has been modified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Locale configuration <br>
The locale mechanism as implemented on modern systems has a
number of design problems, one being that there is no
explicit distinction between text encoding and terminal
encoding <br>
although this is obviously a very different thing and mixed
combinations of both may occur and are actually supported by
mined. <br>
For this reason, mined extends the locale environment
variable mechanism with the variable TEXTLANG which is only
considered for assumed text encoding (with precedence over
the <br>
standard locale variables), &acirc;NEW&acirc; and also
considers LANGUAGE with precedence. <br>
&acirc;NEW&acirc; If one of these additional locale
variables (LANGUAGE or TEXTLANG) is used, mined also
implicitly enables smart quotes. <br>
Also mined provides command line parameters to explicit
override either text or terminal encoding (UTF-8 terminal
encoding, however, is always auto-detected if the terminal
pro&acirc; <br>
vides the information).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; For text
encoding, mined checks the variables &acirc;NEW&acirc;
LANGUAGE, TEXTLANG, LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE, LANG in this
order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; For terminal
encoding, mined checks the variables LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE, LANG
in this order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Explicit command
line parameters are available to specify either terminal
encoding (+E) or text encoding (-E). They override
environment variable settings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; UTF-8 terminal
auto-detection overrides other terminal encoding
settings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Text encoding
auto-detection overrides environment settings but not
command line settings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Assumed text
encoding can be switched while editing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For encoding recognition from
locale environment variables, mined recognises locale
specifications typically found in system installations,
including those which do not include <br>
an explicit encoding suffix. Known character encoding
suffixes (&quot;codeset&quot; component of locale name,
starting with &quot;.&quot;) are recognised regardless of
whether the given locale is <br>
installed or not. Other encodings are recognised by region
suffix (starting with &quot;_&quot;) or full locale name or
alias. <br>
In addition to hard-coded locale recognition (especially for
CJK), locale values and associated encodings are configured
in the compile-time configuration file locales.cfg which
<br>
especially lists locale names that do not have an explicit
encoding suffix. You can use these settings (known locale
name or generic locale name suffix) even on legacy systems
<br>
without locale support to indicate the terminal environment
properly to mined. For encoding recognition from
command-line parameters, mined provides the following
options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; -EX or +EX with
a single-letter encoding tag as listed with the description
of the -E options; further encoding tags are configured in
the compile-time configura&acirc; <br>
tion file charmaps.cfg.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; -E=charmap or
+E=charmap with a character encoding name (as reported by
the locale charmap command).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; -E.suffix or
+E.suffix with a character encoding suffix
(&quot;codeset&quot; of locale name).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; -E:flag or
+E:flag with a 2-letter indication used by mined to indicate
the respective text encoding in the Encoding flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&acirc;NEW&acirc; -E- or -E disables text encoding
auto-detection which is then derived from the locale
environment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In these options, -E specifies
<br>
text encoding while +E would specify terminal encoding to be
assumed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following table lists
encodings and major codepages that are recognised by a
generic locale suffix or country code; in addition (as
mentioned above), a large number of locale <br>
names without encoding suffix as found on various systems is
known to mined and will cause it to assume the corresponding
terminal encoding.</p>

login may help but may not always work (e.g. pcansi is not a
known terminal on SunOS). Explicitly setting locale
vari&acirc; <br>
ables, e.g. LC_CTYPE, may indicate the encoding to mined but
may cause trouble otherwise; some systems like SunOS are
dogmatic about interpreting locale variables and strictly
<br>
ask corresponding locale data to be installed or they will
flood you with bogus error messages. Also not all encodings,
esp. PC &quot;codepages&quot;, are known as a &quot;locale
charmap&quot; on <br>
other systems. <br>
In these cases, you can use the explicit +E option to force
mined to assume a specific terminal encoding; see the option
values listed above for the main DOS encodings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: The encoding emulated by
cygwin (as configured, or by default typically CP1252 for
cygwin 1.5, UTF-8 for cygwin 1.7) is not the encoding
natively applied by the Windows <br>
console window (by default typically the DOS codepage
CP850). This means that the effective encoding may be
different if you invoke the cygwin-compiled mined version
and the <br>
djgpp-compiled mined version alternatingly; you may notice
this by a different range of characters that can be
displayed when opening the same file with the two mined
versions. <br>
Some Windows Latin characters are poorly displayed by the
Windows console in default configuration; cygwin 1.7 can
display all characters properly if the Windows console font
is <br>
configured to &quot;Lucida Console&quot; rather than
&quot;Raster Fonts&quot;. <br>
In a cygwin console on a non-cygwin system (after remote
login), mined assumes ASCII as the terminal encoding by
default unless properly indicated by environment
variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: The following DOS
codepages are supported; they are mainly provided as
terminal codepages, they do not appear in the Encoding menu.
However, if you need, you can ask mined <br>
to use them as either the assumed terminal encoding (e.g.
+E=CP1250 or +E:WE) or even text encoding (e.g. -E=CP1250 or
-E:WE) using the names or shortcuts from the list:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: For the djgpp version of
mined, even the font chosen for the Windows console window
may affect the effective display encoding. Configure
&quot;Raster Fonts&quot; (except of size &quot;10 <br>
x 20&quot;!), not &quot;Lucida Console&quot; in order to
make sure the effective visual codepage is the same as the
one selected with the respective DOS tools (e.g. chcp) and
assumed by mined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: Mined (djgpp) tries to
determine the DOS/Windows codepage using the DOS API; this
can only work if the codepage was properly configured with
DOS means (e.g. with CP858 <br>
using CHCP 858 or MODE CON CP SELECT=858, maybe enabled by
DEVICE=... is switched to a differently encoded one, there
is no way to detect this - in this case you can still use
environment setting or the +E option as described above to
indicate the <br>
terminal encoding.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: To enable mouse operation
in a Windows console window, deactivate &quot;QuickEdit
mode&quot; in the properties menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: If the DOS screen size is
changed by a TSR (e.g. VGAMAX using a hotkey), mined does
not notice this immediately; in that case, mined adjusts its
screen display only after <br>
the next key is typed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: Running mined (djgpp) in a
dosemu session (DOS emulator on Linux) works fine, even in
an xterm-embedded session although not perfectly in that
case: ^S and ^Q are inter&acirc; <br>
preted for flow control (thus ^S will hold all output until
^Q is entered), and the mined option -Qa should be used to
tune menu borders right.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Terminal setup and configuration
<br>
The Mined runtime support library includes a number of
configuration files providing settings that should be
applied to various terminals for proper operation of several
features <br>
as described throughout this manual:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Xdefaults.mined
for major X Windows terminals: xterm, rxvt, some CJK xterm
derivates (cxterm, kterm). The script xinitrc.mined (and
optionally kp5) can be used to <br>
establish the suggested settings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
konsole/xterm-modified.keytab for KDE konsole keyboard
definitions</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; mlterm/key and
mlterm/main for mlterm keyboard definitions</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
terminator/options for terminator keyboard definitions</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In some terminals, the cursor
may not be well visible or not visible at all if the cursor
is on a character with reverse background (control
character, occurs e.g. in xterm) or <br>
highlighted background (invalid character code, occurs e.g.
in xterm and rxvt). See the X resource parameters for
&quot;cursorColor&quot; in the example configuration file
Xde&acirc; <br>
faults.mined for remedy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If mouse wheel movement moves
more than expected, especially if it cannot move by single
items in a menu, this is probably a configuration issue with
your mouse driver. You are <br>
probably running a Windows-based X server which is (often by
default) configured to generate multiple mouse wheel events
on each actual mouse wheel movement. Often not even in <br>
the Control Panel mouse section, but only in a configuration
menu of mouse-specific setup software (e.g. &quot;Browser
Mouse Settings&quot;), configure the scroll unit to 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Terminal interworking problems
<br>
With some terminals, problems are known due to missing
terminal features or terminal bugs:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">any terminal: menu border
display</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If the borders
of mined menus appear as letters rather than graphic
borders, the terminal can unexpectedly not handle VT100
graphics. Use the option -Qa to switch to <br>
ASCII borders, or -fff to limit font assumptions. <br>
In a UTF-8 terminal, mined uses Unicode Box Drawing
characters by default. If they don&rsquo;t display they are
missing in the font used by the terminal. Use the option -Qv
to <br>
switch to VT100 graphics or -Qa to switch to ASCII graphics.
If borders are visible but without corners, use -Qs to
switch to simple rectangular borders.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">any terminal: slow terminal
feature auto-detection</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; On a slow remote
terminal connection, escape sequences from the terminal
(sent for function keys or requested terminal responses) may
get delayed and split up. Mined <br>
tries to handle delayed parts of escape sequences graciously
(&acirc;NEW&acirc; improved again); however, this is limited
as the explicit ESC key shall also be recognised. <br>
If messages like &quot;Late screen mode response - ...&quot;
(after startup), &quot;...awaiting slow terminal
response&quot; (esp. after startup), &quot;...awaiting slow
key code sequence&quot; or <br>
&quot;...absorbing delayed terminal...&quot; occur, escape
sequence detection may be adjusted by setting the
environment variable ESCDELAY to a value of 2000 or 3000.
(Delay during <br>
startup may apparently also be caused by on-demand font
loading of rxvt or mlterm, however, mined applies special
handling for this case.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If proper
terminal detection fails for delay reasons, mined may
especially not be aware of the terminal encoding (and
display line markers as blocks). In this case, exit&acirc;
<br>
ing and restarting mined should resolve the issue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xterm</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; To enable proper
Alt-letter command input (for opening and navigating menus),
set the xterm resource metaSendsEscape to true (or with
older versions of xterm, set eight&acirc; <br>
BitInput to false) in your X configuration (usually
$HOME/.Xdefaults or $HOME/.Xresources) as suggested in the
example file Xdefaults.mined in the Mined runtime support
<br>
library.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Although it is a
waste of keyboard resources to have two indistinguishable
sets of keypad keys, most terminals provide no means of
distinguish them towards the applica&acirc; <br>
tions, at least not by default. Especially for a text
editor, it is highly desirable to distinguish them in order
to have a rich intuitive function key mapping at
disposi&acirc; <br>
tion which mined tries to achieve. <br>
One approach to improve mapping of useful key functions
would be actual keyboard remapping (applicable on some
terminals); this is a delicate approach, though, because it
<br>
may create incompatibilities with other programs that rely
strictly on installed terminfo information. Mined provides
remapping recommendations for shifted keypad keys <br>
(with Shift, Control, Alt and combinations of them) in the
configuration sample files Xdefaults.mined (for xterm),
konsole/xterm-modified.keytab (for KDE konsole), <br>
mlterm/key (for mlterm), in the Mined runtime support
library. <br>
Due to the compatibility limitations mentioned above,
however, the two Ins keys remain indistinguishable, and the
two Del keys are only distinguishable if the xterm
con&acirc; <br>
figuration resource *VT100*deleteIsDEL is set. Also, keypad
and function key modification with the Alt is ensured with
the xterm resource *VT100*metaSendsEscape. Both <br>
resources are set to true in the configuration sample file
just mentioned. <br>
These two resources can also be set dynamically with xterm.
Mined can be told to do so with the command line option +D.
(Unfortunately this handling cannot be enabled by <br>
default as it cannot be undone because the previous state
cannot be detected.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Mined determines
the xterm version in order to apply certain workarounds
conditionally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If you run xterm
in VT220 keyboard mode (using xterm option -kt vt220 or
setting the configuration resource *keyboardType: vt220) you
should make sure to also set the <br>
environment variable TERM=vt220 (e.g. using the xterm option
-tn vt220 or setting the configuration resource *termName:
vt220) so mined can properly set up the keypad <br>
functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If you run xterm
with the resource modifyCursorKeys or modifyFunctionKeys set
to value 1, mined will recognise the according keyboard
sequences with the environment vari&acirc; <br>
able setting TERM=xterm-sco.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xterm on cygwin</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; On cygwin, as on
other systems, the script uterm is recommended to invoke an
xterm that is properly configured to run UTF-8, and also to
use a best choice of fonts for <br>
optimal Unicode coverage. See README.cygwin for more
detailed advice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xterm legacy CJK width mode</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Mined
auto-detects and supports xterm legacy CJK width
compatibility mode (xterm -cjk_width); character width and
menu border layout are properly adjusted, stylish menu <br>
borders (-QQ) and fine-grained scroll bar display are
disabled by default. (Note: In this mode, combining
characters could unexpectedly change the width of a
character by <br>
being substituted with its wide precomposed form (e.g.
&rsquo;a&rsquo; combined with U+0300) - which an application
can hardly handle; this bug was fixed in xterm 224 with a
patch <br>
contributed by the mined author.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rxvt</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; When starting
mined in a fresh rxvt terminal, and maybe even after
starting your X server, some display (font?) initialization
may take extremely long. If this results in <br>
an error message, restart mined to ensure proper terminal
properties auto-detection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Rxvt does not
distinguish between Shift-F1 and F11 / Shift-F2 and F12 /
Ctrl-Shift-F1 and Ctrl-F11 / Ctrl-Shift-F2 and Ctrl-F12, so
that the F1 and F2 keys modified with <br>
Shift cannot be recognised in rxvt by default. They can
however be enabled with the keysym definitions in the file
Xdefaults.mined in the Mined runtime support library.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; In rxvt, the two
keypad Del keys (small keypad, numeric keypad) are
automatically distinguished from each other and invoke the
Delete character (small keypad) and Cut <br>
(numeric keypad) functions, respectively (Ctrl-/Shift-/Alt-
alternatives are supported as described in this manual).
This works, however, only if mined can recognise <br>
rxvt; it is generally a bad idea to set TERM=xterm in rxvt,
see also hint below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Also in rxvt,
the two keypad Ins keys (small keypad left, numeric keypad
right) are distinguished. The left Ins key positions the
cursor left of the pasted region, the <br>
right Ins key positions it right.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; By setting rxvt
in the mode that enables distinction between the two
keypads, it can unfortunately not distinguish the right
keypad modified with Ctrl- anymore, so Ctrl- <br>
Home/End/Del cannot work as desired.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Ctrl-modified
punctuation keys can be enabled by following the
configuration samples of the file Xdefaults.mined in the
Mined runtime support library. <br>
Note: Ctrl-modified and shifted punctuation keys interfere
with ISO 14755 input mode of rxvt; if the following key is
entered twice, that mode is aborted and the modified <br>
punctuation key becomes effective as an accent prefix in
mined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; To enable proper
Alt-letter command input (for opening and navigating menus),
set the rxvt resource meta8 to false in your X configuration
(usually $HOME/.Xdefaults or <br>
$HOME/.Xresources) as suggested in the example file
Xdefaults.mined in the Mined runtime support library.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Later
rxvt-unicode provides a CJK terminal emulation. CJK display
is buggy for characters that rxvt thinks cannot be
displayed, especially for GB18030 <br>
(LC_CTYPE=zh_CN.gb18030 rxvt) but also e.g. for EUC-JP
(LC_CTYPE=ja_JP.eucjp rxvt); single bytes are then
interpreted instead which amounts to an unpredictable screen
<br>
width and cannot be correctly handled. (This applies mainly
to character codes that are not mapped to Unicode but also
to many that are mapped.) <br>
Moreover, CJK width handling is inconsistent for many
characters in rxvt CJK mode (rxvt claims to adhere to the
locale mechanism in this respect but that&rsquo;s not the
case <br>
here - character widths are inconsistent with the locale,
too). <br>
Remedy: Don&rsquo;t use rxvt in CJK-encoded mode; mined CJK
terminal support is tailored to native CJK terminals (such
as cxterm, kterm, hanterm) where it works fine - if you <br>
use a UTF-8-capable terminal, use it in UTF-8 mode! Mined
can edit CJK-encoded files well in a UTF-8-encoded
terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; In rxvt, Unicode
characters that are Not Assigned are always displayed as a
single-width replacement character. This is not consistent
with xterm behaviour which would <br>
display them as a double-width replacement if they are
located within a double-width Unicode range (which sounds
reasonable). This would cause display positioning
incon&acirc; <br>
sistencies. Mined has a workaround for some of these cases
(assuming that rxvt runs the most recent Unicode width data
version available; or actually the same as mined <br>
assumes - handling of multiple auto-detected terminal
Unicode versions does not cover this special case).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If the X windows
servers has duplicate fonts installed under a common name
(e.g. if it comes with a 10x20 non-Unicode font and you
install a 10x20 Unicode font in addi&acirc; <br>
tion), rxvt seems to use the wrong (i.e., non-Unicode)
version of the font and does not find special characters
like the default marker used in the flags menus (this was
<br>
observed since rxvt 7.5, rxvt 5.8 was finding the proper
font). Use the mined option -F to adapt mined to limited
font usage, or fix the X server installation. Or use the
<br>
script uterm to start rxvt-unicode. To start rxvt-unicode
from an xterm, use uterm -rx.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Due to the
scrollbar display workaround for hanterm (see above), the
scrollbar position may be shown as blank space instead of
coloured (only in rxvt CJK mode with Korean <br>
encoding and if you explicitly set TERM=xterm which you
shouldn&rsquo;t anyway in rxvt). In this case, coloured
scrollbar foreground can be enabled with the environment
vari&acirc; <br>
able MINEDSCROLLFG=&quot;44;36&quot; or
MINEDSCROLLFG=&quot;38;5;45&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; As a workaround
for an xterm bug on cygwin, mined applies terminal size
re-adjustment. This may confuse rxvt (being resized to an
unexpectedly large window) if it pretends <br>
to be xterm. <br>
Remedy: in rxvt, make sure that the environment variable
TERM=rxvt (or rxvt-unicode); the according X resource
(Rxvt.termName: rxvt) is also listed in the file Xde&acirc;
<br>
faults.mined in the Mined runtime support library.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Mined determines
the rxvt version in order to use certain features
conditionally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; CJK-mode rxvt:
rxvt has some character width bugs when running in CJK
encoding; e.g. when running rxvt in Big5 terminal encoding
(locale zh_TW), U+FA18 is displayed with <br>
wrong screen width while in older version U+FFED was display
with wrong screen width; when running rxvt in Shift_JIS
terminal encoding, a number of character width bugs <br>
occur. Mined does not implement workarounds for those; in
general UTF-8 terminal encoding is advisable to be on the
safe side.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">urxvt</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; This is
rxvt-unicode as packaged for cygwin. Invoke it with a proper
locale environment variable set to enable UTF-8. See also
README.cygwin for more detailed hints.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mlterm</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Bidirectional
display handling of mlterm is based on the final display,
not regarding any context (such as positioning control,
that&rsquo;s why mined implements a workaround <br>
for menu display on mlterm). Since version 3.0.7, mlterm
supports logical order mouse positioning over right-to-left
lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; For Shift
selection, use the small keypad.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Recent mlterm
before version 3.1.3 has a problem with colour control that
may render text unreadable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; In recent mlterm
versions, Control-function keys cannot be used in mined
since they are captured as mlterm hotkeys. Use a Control-V
prefix as a workaround.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; (Not essential
anymore with recent mlterm versions) The Mined runtime
support library includes a configuration file mlterm/key
which defines enhanced escape sequences for <br>
function keys and other modified keys in order to enable the
functionality described in this manual. (It also enables the
keypad on systems lacking its configuration for <br>
mlterm.) It is essential to use this configuration
especially for the HOP key (keypad &quot;5&quot;) which is
oppressed by mlterm by default, and also for
Control-punctuation <br>
accent prefix functions, and some others.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; In old versions
of mlterm, mouse wheel scroll navigation in menus did not
work seamlessly due to incorrect escape sequences.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Do not use
mlterm option -n ! It may produce display garbage on unknown
and other characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cxterm</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Proper
configuration is needed to ensure cxterm uses a non-CJK font
of appropriate size to avoid ragged display: parameter -fn
&quot;-misc-fixed-medium-r-nor&acirc; <br>
mal--18-*-*-*-*-*-*-*&quot; or X resource cxterm*font:
-misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--18-*-*-*-*-*-*-*.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; EUC-JP
half-width characters (8EA1-8EDF) are not properly displayed
by cxterm in EUC-JP mode (cxterm -JIS, not available in
&quot;classic&quot; cxterm).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Due to the
scrollbar display workaround for hanterm (see above), the
scrollbar position may be shown as blank space instead of
coloured (only in Korean encoding mode which <br>
is probably rarely used with cxterm anyway). In this case,
coloured scrollbar foreground can be enabled with the
environment variable MINEDSCROLLFG=&quot;44;36&quot; or
MINED&acirc; <br>
SCROLLFG=&quot;38;5;45&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Note: The
configuration sample file Xefaults.mined in the Mined
runtime support library includes a section to fix some
missing keypad assignments, especially the HOP key <br>
(keypad &quot;5&quot;) which is ignored by cxterm by
default, and the Home and End keys of the numeric
keypad.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kterm</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Auto-detection
of kterm as a CJK terminal works if the environment variable
TERM indicates &quot;kterm&quot;; otherwise mined has to be
told that it runs in a CJK terminal and which <br>
encoding to use: <br>
For kterm -km sjis, set LC_CTYPE=ja_JP.sjis (or invoke mined
+ES). <br>
For kterm -km euc, set LC_CTYPE=ja_JP.eucjp (or invoke mined
+EJ).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Note:The
configuration sample file Xefaults.mined in the Mined
runtime support library includes a section to fix some
missing keypad assignments, especially the HOP key <br>
(keypad &quot;5&quot;) which is ignored by kterm by default,
and the Home and End keys of both keypads.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Note: Mouse
wheel scroll navigation in menus does not work seamlessly in
kterm because kterm sends incorrect escape sequences on
mouse wheel scrolling.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Note: By default
(i.e., without explicit -km option or corresponding
*vt100.kanjiMode resource configured), kterm runs in ISO
2022 mode (yes, it does indeed) which is not <br>
supported by mined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hanterm</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; CJK display is
buggy at the line beginning or after a Tab, often only the
second byte of the character code is displayed as an ASCII
character instead of displaying the <br>
complete CJK character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Character
attributes in hanterm used to be all mapped to reverse, so
there was a workaround to enable a visible position in the
scrollbar which is displayed as blank <br>
space. The criteria for this workaround to apply are: CJK
terminal (detected or configured), TERM=xterm, Korean
encoding (UHC or Johab) configured with parameter or <br>
locale. Replaced to enable nicer colours in scrollbar. To
reactivate workaround for older hanterm, set environment
variable MINEDSCROLLFG=&quot;0&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KDE konsole</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Due to the lack
of decent Unicode font support in the default configuration
of the KDE konsole terminal, menu appearance options -QQ and
-Qr should not be used; rounded <br>
borders are disabled by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The Mined
runtime support library includes a configuration file
konsole/xterm-modified.keytab which defines enhanced escape
sequences for function keys and other modified <br>
keys in order to enable the functionality described in this
manual. Unfortunately, the qt framework used by konsole
inhibits the use of some keys and many key combina&acirc;
<br>
tions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; It is especially
irritating that konsole disregards the middle keypad key
(&quot;5&quot; in application mode) completely; so the mined
HOP function has to be invoked by alternative <br>
means. <br>
As a remedy, the HOP function is also assigned to the
&quot;Menu&quot; key (next to the &quot;Windows&quot; key on
PC keyboards) by the configuration sample file
konsole/xterm-modi&acirc; <br>
fied.keytab; follow the installation instruction in that
file and select the keyboard type it defines (&quot;xterm
with key modifiers&quot;) in konsole, &quot;Settings&quot; -
&quot;Keyboard&quot; <br>
menu. <br>
Another remedy is to reassign the middle keypad key to the X
key symbol Menu (using xmodmap); the script kp5 in the Mined
runtime support library does this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gnome-terminal</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The
gnome-terminal uses right mouse click for its own terminal
menu. To open a mined menu, use Ctrl-right-mouse-click.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The
gnome-terminal does not support modified keys (e.g. shifted
keypad keys).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The
gnome-terminal captures a number of Alt-letter key
combinations for its own menu access (which can however also
be controlled with the mouse). To disable this <br>
unpleasant capturing, so e.g. mined can open its own menus
with Alt-letter, configure gnome-terminal as follows: <br>
Open menu &quot;Edit&quot; - &quot;Keyboard
Shortcuts...&quot; and check &quot;Disable all menu access
keys&quot;. Even then, however, F1 and Ctrl-F1 are
suppressed by this quirky terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Mined implicitly
assumes its -f option (for limited font usage with respect
to graphic characters) when detecting gnome-terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mac OS X Terminal and others</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The Mac OS X
Terminal app does not support mouse escape sequences.
Preferably, use xterm or iTerm 2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; In iTerm 2,
enable mouse reporting in the settings menu Preferences -
Profile - Terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If any Mac
terminal (Terminal, xterm, iTerm 2) does not respond to the
ESC key, it is likely to be captured by Speech Recognition.
Disable Speech Recognition or try Ctrl- <br>
ESC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Linux console</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Mined detects
F11, F12, Shift-F1...Shift-F8 properly (handling the shift
of 2 applied by the Linux console to shifted function key
codes compared with other terminals); <br>
further modified function keys are apparently not supported
in the Linux console.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">screen</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Screen, like luit (see below),
is a middle layer between the <br>
actual terminal and the user terminal environment. <br>
Running screen in a cygwin console produces initial garbage
input in mined. <br>
[Applies to older screen before version 4: Unfortunately,
screen does not pass character width handling of its host
terminal transparently to the application but appar&acirc;
<br>
ently it maintains cursor position information with
reference to the system-installed locale data. Which,
however, does not always reflect the terminal properties!
Yet <br>
mined detects the proper width properties of the host
terminal (by using pass-through escape sequences of
&quot;screen&quot;) but only if the environment variable is
set to &quot;screen&quot; <br>
(the default of &quot;screen&quot;).] <br>
Worse, however, screen apparently transforms cursor
positioning commands from the application into relative
cursor positioning towards the host terminal, which results
in <br>
grossly incorrect display positionining if e.g. screen runs
in a UTF-8 terminal but assumes an 8 bit terminal. Also, it
interprets certain UTF-8 continuation bytes as con&acirc;
<br>
trol characters, so even using a workaround it is not
possible to fix display for all cases. Mined applies a
workaround to fix text positioning and menu display problems
<br>
with screen. Another workaround fixes many cases of UTF-8
character display but cannot fix all (since screen captures
the output of the 0x9C byte). It is recommended to <br>
invoke screen only with properly configured locale
environment variables to match the actual terminal
encoding.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mintty (&quot;Cygwin
Terminal&quot;)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mintty is a Windows-based
(non-X) terminal running with cygwin. <br>
Mined auto-detects mintty and adjusts certain properties and
features accordingly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Mined detects
font changes that change the CJK ambiguous character width
properties of the terminal when notified by mintty if
running in UTF-8 mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; For good
coverage of Unicode characters, recommended fonts for use
with mintty are DejaVu Sans Mono, Lucida Console, Courier
New, Andale Mono, Everson Mono, SimSun. Dis&acirc; <br>
couraged are Lucida Sans Typewriter, Letter Gothic, Courier,
Monaco, and older MS CJK fonts, at least for their lack of
(proper) graphic characters (for menu borders). <br>
Mined uses the glyph detection feature of mintty (since
0.9.9) to configure a nice set of useful line markers and
menu graphics.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If break
interruption (Control-&nbsp;key) does not work on
international keyboards (if AltGr is involved), use the
special Control-Break keyboard function instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Note: For
right-to-left text editing, the bidi feature of mintty
interferes with the scrollbar of mined; you may disable the
scrollbar with -o to reduce visual confusion. <br>
(Context-dependent scrollbar display is planned for a later
version.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Note: With the
command scripts wined or wined.bat, mined is invoked in a
separate Windows terminal session, using mintty if
available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Note: On some
systems, mouse wheel scrolling does not work in mintty if
the mintty scrollbar is enabled. It can be disabled in the
mintty &quot;Options...&quot; menu, section &quot;Win&acirc;
<br>
dow&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Note: Mined
temporarily disables mintty shortcut keys for Windows
functions (like Alt-function keys, Alt-space, Alt-Enter) in
order to use them itself. To toggle mintty <br>
full-screen mode, open the mintty menu with Shift-right
mouse button, item &quot;Fullscreen&quot;. <br>
(With mintty versions before 0.5.1, for proper usage of
Unix-like keyboards functions, the following settings are
recommended: In Options - Keys, disable the Shortcuts <br>
&quot;Window commands&quot; and &quot;Copy and paste&quot;.
In Options - Text, disable &quot;Show bold as
bright&quot;.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cygwin console</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The cygwin
console terminal emulation does not support Shift-F1,
Shift-F2 (which cannot be distinguished from F11, F12),
Shift-F11, Shift-F12; Control or Alt modified <br>
function keys are supported beginning cygwin 1.7.2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Mined detects
UTF-8 mode of cygwin 1.7 console (by LC_*/LANG setting or
for cygwin 1.7 beta by CYGWIN containing
&quot;codepage:utf8&quot;). <br>
Note: After rlogin from this console, UTF-8 indication has
to be ensured explicitly, e.g. by environment setting, or by
mined option +U.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Note: Cygwin
console in UTF-8 mode provides extended Unicode font support
if you select &quot;Lucida Console&quot; or another TrueType
font from its Properties menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If the Windows
program chcp.com is used within cygwin, and the console
window is set up to use &quot;Raster Fonts&quot;, non-ASCII
characters may be mangled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Mouse
coordinates are not properly reported with wheel scrolling
in the cygwin console; for that reason, opening a menu with
mouse scrolling does not work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; See also
README.cygwin for more detailed hints on weird details about
the Windows console in different modes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Windows console window (DOS
command prompt)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The Windows
console window is normally configured to run in CP850
encoding or other legacy encodings (depending on localized
Windows configuration), it may also turn out <br>
to use CP437. Non-displayable characters are replaced as
usual. The configured font may also affect the effective
display character set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; However, if
running a cygwin application (like the cygwin version of
mined) from a Windows console, the cygwin emulated terminal
encoding applies instead, e.g. UTF-8.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Note: The
(djgpp-compiled) DOS version of mined automatically adjusts
to the selected console codepage (e.g. using the chcp
command), it is advisable to set up the console <br>
windows to use &quot;Raster Fonts&quot; if this is used.
With the cygwin-compiled version, on the other hand, using a
TrueType font is more stable with respect to character set
<br>
problems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; With the
djgpp-compiled version apparently there is a Ctrl-C problem
on older Windows versions. Every first Ctrl-C will display
^C on the screen at the current position <br>
without mined noticing it, while every second Ctrl-C will be
passed to mined. This problem does not occur on Windows XP.
It does occur on Windows ME in a Windows console <br>
window. It does not occur with the cygwin-compiled
version.</p>

Options - Save Options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; On a remote

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Work-around support to enable
8-bit character set on weird terminals <br>
There exist some exceptionally weird 7 bit terminals that
have an alternative character set containing composed
characters which can be displayed simultaneously with the
default <br>
character set. For those there is optional output
translation which embeds non-ASCII characters into the
respective code switching sequences. To enable output
character transfor&acirc; <br>
mation, set the environment variable MINEDOUT to contain the
upper half (with respect to an 8 bit character set) of the
translation table into the terminal&rsquo;s alternate
character <br>
set. (Character set switching will be done as specified in
the termcap (as/ae) or terminfo (smacs/rmacs) entry.) An
example setting of MINEDOUT is included in the environment
<br>
sample file profile.mined in the Mined runtime support
library for Siemens 9780x terminals.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Concerning some especially
stupid terminal drivers <br>
There used to be terminal drivers which make use of the soft
handshake mechanism by exchange of ^S and ^Q characters but
yet pass them through to application programs which is <br>
quite stupid. If it is necessary to ignore such hazardous ^S
and ^Q keys, the environment variable NoCtrlSQ or
NoControlSQ must be set. Mined will then not disable the tty
<br>
channel soft handshake setting either.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Keyboard mapping / Input method
preselection <br>
With the environment variable MINEDKEYMAP the active or
standby mapping or both can be preselected. The value is a
two-letter script tag to set the active mapping, or it is
<br>
prepended with &quot;-&quot; to set the standby mapping, or
a combination. <br>
Example: export MINEDKEYMAP=-gr will set Greek keyboard
mapping standby. export MINEDKEYMAP=py-rs will set Pinyin
input method active and Radical/Stroke input method standby.
<br>
The respective tags attached to the keyboard mappings can be
looked up in the Input Method flag menu; the HOP function
toggles between display of the full input method name and
<br>
its tag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Smart Quotes style configuration
<br>
Smart quotes style can also be preselected with the
environment variable MINEDQUOTES (in addition to command
line option -q=..., standard locale environment variables,
or addi&acirc; <br>
tional locale environment variables LANGUAGE or TEXTLANG
which also implicitly set smart quotes mode). <br>
The value of MINEDQUOTES should contain the opening/closing
quote pair (or just the opening quote mark, double or single
quotes) and must be UTF-8 encoded. It can optionally <br>
append a space and an inner quotation mark (as used for
nested quotations) for more specific selection. It can also
indicate French spacing as shown in the example. <br>
Examples (for values of -q parameter or MINEDQUOTES
variable): &Acirc;&raquo; sets
&Acirc;&raquo;Danish&Acirc;&laquo; quotes style and
corresponding single smart quotes.
&Acirc;&raquo;&Acirc;&raquo; sets
&Acirc;&raquo;Finnish&Acirc;&raquo; quotes style and
correspond&acirc; <br>
ing single smart quotes. &Acirc;&laquo;&Acirc;&raquo;
&rsquo;&rsquo; (where &rsquo;&rsquo; denotes a left double
quotation mark U+201C) sets
&Acirc;&laquo;Spanish&Acirc;&raquo; quotes style with
English style inner quotation marks. &Acirc;&laquo;

The paste buffers, used for cut/copy/paste operations, as
well as the inter-window paste buffer, are located in a

maintain the inter-window paste functionality even remotely,
mined uses the environement variables MINEDTMP and MINEDUSER
which, in combination, point to a user-defined temporary
<br>
directory and file name pattern to be used for buffer
files:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Set MINEDTMP to
refer to a common mounted network directory on all machines
which means that the value of $MINEDTMP may have to be
different to reflect different <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Printing configuration <br>
Mined uses the script uprint from the Mined runtime support
library to print the current contents of the text being
edited in any selected encoding (unless the environment
vari&acirc; <br>
able MINEDPRINT is set to direct mined to use a different
print command). <br>
If the support library is not installed in one of its
standard locations (system-dependent), it should be made
available in the usual command search path. <br>
The script offers a choice of configured printers to select
one (using either Windows registry or &acirc;NEW&acirc; CUPS
lpstat). <br>
The script uses either paps or uniprint for actual
formatting (print preprocessing). Under Windows
(cygwin/stand-alone/djgpp versions), mined also considers
printing with <br>
notepad /p. <br>
paps is available at http://paps.sourceforge.net/ and uses
the Pango layout engine for formatting. uniprint is part of
the yudit distribution; if you don&rsquo;t have it installed
on <br>
your system, there is another script makeprint in the
support library which can be used to download and build the
needed uniprint program. The mined print script (uprint)
<br>
prefers paps if it is available as it has more capabilities
for printing a wide range of Unicode characters, and it does
right-to-left formatting. <br>
The font to be used with uprint can be configured with the
environment variables FONT, FONTPATH, FONTSIZE. It is
recommended to put a sufficient font in the directories of
<br>
$FONTPATH, e.g. DroidSansMono, LucidaTypewriterRegular,
Bitstream Cyberbit. <br>
The preferred printer can be configured as usual with the
environment variable PRINTER. In addition, uprint checks an
environment variable LPR for an alternative for the system
<br>
printing command (lpr/lp) if that is needed. <br>
Note: If printing with uprint fails for some reason, mined
tries to print with either the print command configured in
the environment variable LPR as a fallback, or with lp/lpr
<br>
as a last resort. Working character encoding support cannot
be expected in this case, however. <br>
See Environment variables to configure Printing for further
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Display layout <br>
Some of the special indication characters (that substitute
non-displayable contents) and some of the colours used by
mined for special indications and interactive elements may
be <br>
configured to the user&rsquo;s preference. <br>
Note: For the configurable character indications, two
environment variables exist each, to configure an 8 bit
value (Latin-1 encoded) and to configure a Unicode value
(UTF-8 <br>
encoded). The UTF-8 encoded values (e.g. MINEDUTFRET) take
precedence in a UTF-8 terminal. In an 8 bit terminal, or if
the respective UTF-8 variable is not configured, the <br>
Latin-1 encoded value applies. See the example script
profile.mined in the Mined runtime support library for more
details and for a number of suggestions of suitable values.
<br>
Mined does not apply any default non-Latin-1 indications in
order to avoid display problems with fonts that do not
support them. Depending on your visual preference, there are
a <br>
number of suitable Unicode characters for use as indications
especially in the Unicode ranges of Arrows, Geometric Shapes
and Symbols (U+2190-U+2BFF). <br>
Note: For the Latin-1 encoded configured indication markers
(variables MINEDRET etc, not MINEDUTFRET etc), if the
configured character is in the small letters range (actually
<br>
&rsquo;&lsquo;&rsquo;...DEL) the alternate character set is
used for display. This works also in a UTF-8 terminal,
provided that the corresponding UTF-8-encoded indication
configuration variable <br>
is not set, e.g. MINEDRET=j MINEDUTFRET= (or not defined)
would indicate line-ends by displaying a graphic lower right
corner, MINEDTAB=&rsquo;&lsquo;&rsquo; MINEDUTFTAB= (or not
defined) would <br>
indicate Tab characters with VT100 graphics lozenge rhombs.
<br>
Note: For the UTF-8-encoded configured indication markers
(variables MINEDUTFRET etc), if the marker is a double-width
character, a replacement will be displayed instead. <br>
Note: Mined reduces its assumptions about available graphic
and special characters for display purposes with the options
-f or -F. The -F option also suppresses the
interpreta&acirc; <br>
tion of the MINEDUTF* environment variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Line ends <br>
Line ends are usually marked by a &quot;&Acirc;&laquo;&quot;
double left angle character. This visual indication can be
changed with the environment variable MINEDRET (8 bit
terminals) or MINEDUTFRET <br>
(UTF-8 terminals). The default or configured marker is used
as an indicator at the end of every text line on screen (so
you can see how many blank spaces there are). <br>
Multi-character markers: If a second character is
configured, it is used to fill the rest of the screen line,
a third configured character would terminate the indication
at the <br>
end of the screen line.
(&quot;&Acirc;&middot;&Acirc;&middot;&Acirc;&laquo;&quot; is
a nice setting for people who used to work at Siemens
terminals.) Pattern: <br>
&lt;span&gt;MINEDRET=123 # line end displays as 122222223
<br>
Suggestion for a nice line end on UTF-8 mode terminals
(check if character is included in your font, however!):
<br>
&lt;span&gt;MINEDUTFRET=&acirc; # U+23CE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The indication of DOS line ends
(CRLF) and Mac line ends (CR) may be configured with the
variables MINEDDOSRET or MINEDUTFDOSRET, and MINEDMACRET or
MINEDUTFMACRET, respectively. <br>
They are also distinguished by different colours.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Paragraph ends <br>
With the option -p, mined displays distinct indicators for
line ends and paragraph ends. A paragraph is defined to
continue while lines end with white space (space or Tab
char&acirc; <br>
acter). The default paragraph marker is
&quot;&Acirc;&para;&quot; and is also used to indicate a
line ending with a Unicode Paragraph Separator. It can be
changed with the environment variable MINED&acirc; <br>
PARA or MINEDUTFPARA.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tab characters <br>
Tab characters are usually indicated by a sequence of
&rsquo;&Acirc;&middot;&rsquo; (middle dot) characters. This
can be changed with the environment variable MINEDTAB (8 bit
terminal) or MINEDUTFTAB <br>
(UTF-8 terminals). <br>
Multi-character markers: If two characters are configured,
the second is used to mark the middle of the Tab span. If
three characters are configured, the first and last are used
<br>
to mark the beginning and end of the Tab span. Pattern: <br>
&lt;span&gt;MINEDTAB=123 # Tab displays as 12222223 <br>
&lt;span&gt;MINEDTAB=12 # Tab displays as 11112111</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Long lines <br>
Lines which are too long for the screen are usually
indicated by a &rsquo;&Acirc;&raquo;&rsquo; double right
angle (guillemot) character. If the current position is
behind the screen margin, the line is <br>
shifted out left which is indicated by a
&rsquo;&Acirc;&laquo;&rsquo; double left angle. These
markers can be changed with the environment variable
MINEDSHIFT or MINEDUTFSHIFT. The first character is <br>
used to indicate a line continued to the left of the screen,
the second character is used to indicate a line continued to
the right of the screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unicode characters <br>
For a description of special display indications in UTF-8
text editing mode see &quot;Unicode display&quot; above. The
indication and highlighting mode of a non-displayable
Unicode char&acirc; <br>
acter (typically a UTF-8 character in a Latin-1 terminal),
as well as the highlighting mode (colour) of the indication
of illegal UTF-8 sequences, can be configured with the <br>
variable MINEDUNI.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Display mode of indicators <br>
It is recommended to display these indicator characters in a
dim display mode to prevent distraction from the text
contents. The default is a red colour which is a moderate
dark <br>
red in xterm. The display mode can be used by placing the
code part of an ANSI display control sequence in the
environment variable MINEDDIM. E.g., MINEDDIM=31 would
select the <br>
default mode, red foreground; in xterm only,
MINEDDIM=&quot;38;5;83;38;5;245&quot; gives a moderate gray
in either 88 or 256 color mode; in rxvt only,
MINEDDIM=&quot;38;5;83&quot; gives a moderate <br>
gray. <br>
MINEDDIM can also be set to an integer percentage value
(e.g. MINEDIM=&quot;50%&quot;) to have mined apply dim
colour to the indications; the colour value is computed from
the current <br>
foreground and background colours (works in xterm, or mintty
from version 404). The ANSI colour 7 (white) is temporarily
redefined for this purpose and restored when mined
exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Display mode of menu borders
<br>
The display colour of menu borders and menu headers can be
configured with the environment variable MINEDBORDER.
Suitable values are &quot;35&quot; (magenta), &quot;34&quot;
(blue) and &quot;31&quot; <br>
(default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Status line highlighting <br>
Highlighted parts of status line messages (e.g. initial
letters for help selection after F1) can be configured with
the environment variable MINEDEMPH, using foreground ANSI
<br>
modes. The default is &quot;31&quot; (effectively red
background).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Scrollbar colour <br>
The foreground and background colours of the scrollbar can
be configured with MINEDSCROLLFG and MINEDSCROLLBG,
respectively, using ANSI modes; if only the background is
config&acirc; <br>
ured, the foreground is the reverse of it. In general, to
support fine-grained scrollbar display in UTF-8 terminals,
the foreground and background colour settings should be the
<br>
reverse of each other. The default for the background is
&quot;46;34;48;5;45&quot; if use of 256 colour mode is
enabled, or &quot;46;34&quot; if it is disabled. The default
for the foreground is <br>
&quot;&quot;, meaning that the reverse background is used,
with a workaround for hanterm (see above).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Menu colour and border style
<br>
The highlighting background colour of the selected menu item
can be configured with MINEDSEL, using reverse ANSI modes
(i.e. using foreground parameters for the background) and
<br>
MINEDSELFG for the foreground, using reverse ANSI modes. The
default values are MINEDSELFG=&quot;43&quot; and
MINEDSEL=&quot;34&quot;, giving yellow on blue. If selected
menu items appear too dark <br>
(which mined tries to avoid, depending on the terminal), try
one of the workarounds MINEDSEL=&quot;34;1&quot; or
MINEDSELFG=&quot;43;1&quot;. <br>
Menu border styles can be selected with the option -Q. For a
nice selection bar that extends from left to right menu
border, the setting -QQ is recommended (this is the default
<br>
unless the terminal is assumed not to provide sufficient
font configuration for this option; it depends on certain
graphic Unicode characters being included in the terminal
font <br>
and can be disabled with -Qq).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Combining character display <br>
The highlighting background colour of combining characters
displayed in separated mode can be configured with
MINEDCOMBINING, using ANSI background modes. The default
value is <br>
MINEDCOMBINING=46, to change colour e.g. to yellow
background, use MINEDCOMBINING=43.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Interactive Help access <br>
Mined looks for its help file in a number of typical
directories for installation of the Mined runtime support
library. If it is placed in a non-standard location, the
environ&acirc; <br>
ment variable MINEDDIR should point to the directory. (Mined
also tries to find the help file in the directory where it
was started from; this is especially useful for the <br>
DOS/Windows version.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mined compile-time configuration
<br>
Script highlighting <br>
The the mined distribution contains a file src/colours.cfg;
it contains entries with the script name (as listed in the
Unicode data file Scripts.txt), blank space, and a colour
<br>
index into the xterm 256-colour mode. (To make good use of
256 colour mode, the terminal program should be compiled
with 256 colour support enabled. Configure xterm with
config&acirc; <br>
ure --enable-256-color .) <br>
Edit colours.cfg before building mined to adapt coloured
script display to your preferences.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Encodings and Encoding menu <br>
The mined distribution contains a file src/charmaps.cfg
which defines the character encodings that mined knows and
how they are presented in the Encoding menu, together with
<br>
flags for indication in the Encoding flag and tags for use
with the -E and +E options (and the MINEDDETECT environment
variable). <br>
The configuration file allows the definition of submenus in
the Encoding menu. <br>
Each character encoding entry charmap-name must correspond
to an existing character mapping file
charmaps/charmap-name.map. Additional character mappings can
be generated with <br>
the script mkchrmap.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Encodings recognised by locale
names <br>
The mined distribution contains a file src/locales.cfg which
maps locale names to associated character encodings. While
this list contains mainly locale names without explicit <br>
encoding suffix, mined also checks generic locale name
suffix values and assumes the corresponding terminal
encoding. Thus the given names or suffixes can be used even
on legacy <br>
systems without locale support to indicate the terminal
environment and preferred text encoding properly to
mined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Keyboard mapping (Input method)
<br>
The mined distribution contains a file src/keymaps.cfg and a
script mkkbmap; go into the src directory and use the script
to generate additional keyboard mappings: The parameter <br>
to the mkkbmap script can be one of</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">path.../name.mim <br>
a keyboard mapping file of the m17n-db multilingualization
package</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">path.../name.kmap <br>
a keyboard mapping file of the yudit text editor</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">path.../name.vim <br>
a keyboard mapping file of the vim text editor</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">path.../name.cit <br>
an input method mapping file of the cxterm terminal, binary
form; only works if the cxterm binary/text conversion
utility cit2tit is accessible</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">path.../name.tit <br>
an input method mapping file of the cxterm terminal, text
form; only works if the character set conversion utility
iconv is accessible and works on the mapping file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">path.../name.utf <br>
an input method mapping file of the cxterm terminal, already
converted to UTF-8 encoding (e.g. with iconv)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cangjie [ &lt; HKSCS Changjie
table file name &gt; ] <br>
with this tag, a keyboard mapping for the Cangjie input
method will be generated, taking information from the Unihan
database (unicode.org); <br>
with a second parameter, a Big5-encoded table of HKSCS
Changjie input codes will be merged in, the parameter is
either the file name or a + sign which is implicitly <br>
expanded to the relative path name
etc/charmaps/hkscs/hkscs-2004-cj.txt; the HKSCS input codes
file should be taken from

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MainlandTelegraph ,
TaiwanTelegraph <br>
with one of these tags, a keyboard mapping will be generated
using one of these telegraph codes as an input method,
taking information from the Unihan database <br>
(unicode.org)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cantonese , HanyuPinlu ,
Mandarin , Tang <br>
with one of these tags, a keyboard mapping will be generated
using the according Chinese pronunciation as an input

<p style="margin-top: 1em">JapaneseKun , JapaneseOn <br>
with one of these tags, a keyboard mapping will be generated
using Japanese or Sino-Japanese pronunciation as an input
method, taking information from the Unihan <br>
database (unicode.org)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Korean , Vietnamese <br>
with one of these tags, a keyboard mapping will be generated
using Korean or Vietnamese pronunciation as an input method,
taking information from the Unihan data&acirc; <br>
base (unicode.org)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VIQR , VNI , Vtelex <br>
with one of these tags, a keyboard mapping will be generated
for the respective Vietnamese input methods, taking
character information from the Unicode database <br>
(unicode.org)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">script tag <br>
for many scripts listed in the UnicodeData.txt database,
character names listed there can build a useful keyboard
mapping; mkkbmap will then generate an according <br>
keyboard mapping file, e.g. for Bopomofo <br>
Each successful generation of a mapping table adds an entry
to the configuration file keymaps.cfg; the entry is however
initially disabled as it usually needs manual adjustment:
<br>
edit the configuration file; enable the new entry by
removing the leading &rsquo;#&rsquo; character, check the
first element which will be the name of the mapping to
appear in the Input <br>
Method menu, check the last element of the entry which is a
two-letter shortcut and must be unique for all mappings,
then move the entry to the position where you want it to
<br>
appear in the menu. You can also group mappings by adding
&quot;-&quot; lines in this configuration file. <br>
For the Unicode data version used for included keyboard
mappings, see the mined change log. <br>
For the keyboard mappings generated from Unihan data,
characters are sorted according to the priorities of their
Unicode ranges (assigning lower priority to
&quot;Supplement&quot; and <br>
&quot;Extension&quot; and &quot;Compatibility&quot; ranges).
So for some input mnemos, the &quot;pick list&quot; for the
Cangjie input method is displayed more in order of
relevance. <br>
For keyboard mappings for CJK encodings, mkkbmap will add
appropriate punctuation mapping entries for Chinese,
Japanese, Korean, respectively, in addition to the entries
derived <br>
from the respective data source.</p>
