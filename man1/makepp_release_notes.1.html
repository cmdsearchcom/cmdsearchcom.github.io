MAKEPP_RELEASE_NOTES(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
makepp_release_notes -- Major changes in each version of
makepp</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Version 2.1 (under development) <br>
&Acirc;&middot; Builtin &amp;template mini-language
documentation rewritten. It now has an
&quot;@include(filename)@&quot; macro.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; C Scanner now
takes into account compiler specific path variables like
&quot;C_INCLUDE_PATH&quot; or &quot;LIB&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Parens now nest
as in GNU make or Shell: &quot;$(name ...()...)&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; New environment
variable &quot;MAKEPP_DEBUG&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Installation
defaults for html-doc and man have changed slightly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The new option
&quot;--loop&quot; is the successor to
&quot;--stop-after-loading&quot;, which it enhances to get
the head start for every edit compile cycle in an endless
loop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The
&quot;include&quot; statements and the functions
&quot;find-first-upwards&quot; and &quot;find-upwards&quot;
will no longer search higher than a RootMakeppfile, if one
is present.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The gmake style
of putting the rule to make an include file after the
include statement is not recommended, but now supported.
Thus the option &quot;--defer-include&quot; has been <br>
removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; All pre-2.0
features which issued deprecated-warnings are eliminated, as
are $Mpp::Makefile::legacy_functions and
$MAKEPP_INSTALL_OLD_MODULES.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; You can use the
new makeppinfo, mppi option &quot;--unremembered&quot; to
spot no longer needed files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; You can use the
new makeppreplay, mppr option &quot;--sed&quot; to replay a
command differently, e.g. to stop after preprocessing or to
add debugging options to the linker.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; There was an
undocumented (and slightly buggy) feature whereby making
.makepp/log unwritable would suppress logging. Now instead
it falls back to &quot;--verbose&quot;, so you must <br>
pass &quot;--no-log&quot; if you want that. This option and
a few others were also already available for makeppreplay,
mppr, but not documented.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; At least Perl
5.8 is required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Version 2.0 (March 2012) <br>
The items are roughly ordered by increasing age, so you need
to read only the first parts if you&rsquo;ve been using
snapshots newer than 1.40.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The signature
statement no longer overrides the method found by command
parsers -- now you must provide the &quot;override&quot;
keyword if you want that. There are new signature <br>
methods &quot;xml&quot; and &quot;xml-space&quot;. The
&quot;c_compilation_md5&quot; signature can now also be
invoked as &quot;C&quot; (because signatures pertain to
files, not actions). It (and its subclasses) <br>
can now easily be extended to other suffixes as in
&quot;C.ipp,tpp&quot; meaning that besides the built in
suffixes it will also apply to files ending in .ipp or .tpp.
Thanks to this <br>
makeppreplay and embedded SQL/C now works more reliably.
Beware: this is not understood by older versions. So
don&rsquo;t call an older mpp on things built with this
version, <br>
which includes from a repository you built in.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The keyword
&quot;global&quot; can precede the &quot;build_cache&quot;,
&quot;build_check&quot; and &quot;signature&quot; statements
and the &quot;define&quot; statement which now also allows
&quot;export&quot;. Therefore s_ subs now <br>
get a 4th parameter, a hash reference with the encountered
keywords as keys.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Makefiles are
now parsed with the same priority as in gmake. Hence
&quot;include :&quot; or &quot;include =&quot; are now
statements (no space: still rule or assignment.) This means
that &quot;perl <br>
{ qualified::name }&quot; no longer mysteriously disapears
(it used to be a useless rule.) Now variable names may
contain whitespace. This means that &quot;&amp;preprocess
--assignment&quot; <br>
will treat just about any equal sign as an assignment
(replace them with $E from the funny assignment
&quot;E==&quot;.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If you have a
federated build cache over several disks, and some of them
are preferred, you must edit their build_cache_options.pl
and change PREFERRED to xPREFERRED. (This <br>
reflects a general change in names where we now prefix by
&rsquo;x&rsquo; all xATTRIBUTES which are are true iff they
exist).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The
&quot;VPATH&quot; variable and &quot;vpath&quot; statement
are now emulated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Makefile
functions (&quot;sub f_...&quot;) may now get their 1st
parameter as a string reference. In that case you are
responsible for expanding your arguments. Use the accessor
<br>
functions &amp;arg or &quot;args&quot; described in makepp
extensions. Until you get round to updating your functions,
you can turn this off by setting
&quot;$Mpp::Makefile::legacy_functions = <br>
1&quot; either in your makefile (one per build system is
enough, as it&rsquo;s a Perl variable) or patch it into your
new makepp installation. If you want your updated functions
to <br>
work with both your old and this new makepp, use &quot;ref
$_[0] ? &amp;arg : $_[0]&quot; or &quot;ref $_[0] ?
args(...) : $_[0]&quot; in the transition phase.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Within &quot;$(call)&quot;, the
special variables &quot;$0, $1, ..., $(11), ...&quot; are
now expanded like any other make variable. This causes
slight differences to the previous work around. <br>
The result is closer to gmake, at least if
&quot;makepp_simple_concatenation=1&quot; is set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; CMake generated
makefiles no longer lead to deep recursion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; New scanner
&quot;esql_compilation&quot; for embedded SQL C, now covers
all databases. You must supply the rules, however.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; New option
--hybrid-recursive-make (follow each option link, to see
shorter forms) as a smarter alternative to
--traditional-recursive-make.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">New option --stop-after-loading
gives makepp a headstart while you&rsquo;re still
editing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">New options --rm-stale,
--sandbox and --dont-read, for sandbox control when running
multiple concurrent (possibly distributed) makepp
commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Makepp will now also look for
options in files called .makepprc. The option --args-file is
now consistently available on all commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The environment variable
MAKEPP_CASE_SENSITIVE_FILENAMES supercedes the options
--case-sensitive-filenames and
--no-case-sensitive-filenames.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Removed
&quot;--keep-repository-links&quot; option, the behaviour of
which is now the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All utilities now also query an
environment variable for presetting options. Each one is
called like the utility in upper case, with FLAGS added,
e.g. $MAKEPPCLEANFLAGS or <br>
$MAKEPPLOGFLAGS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Short command line options may
now be grouped in the Unix way, so &quot;-k -j 4&quot; may
be given as &quot;-kj4&quot;. In all long options the dash
between words may now consistently be <br>
omitted or replaced with an underscore, so that
&quot;--no-log&quot; can be &quot;--nolog&quot; or
&quot;--no_log&quot;. Unknown options now cause an
error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Originally
&quot;makeppclean&quot; &quot;-l&quot; meant
&quot;--leave-src-info&quot;, but now the options have been
extended and this one changed to
&quot;-k|--keep-src-info&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Scanning
terminology has been cleaned up (and the page rewritten) to
finally match a redesign that happened a few years ago.
There are now 3 separate terms, the lexer (which <br>
users don&rsquo;t need to worry about), the (command)
parsers and the (file) scanners.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For advanced users: The new
interface consists of the &quot;register_parser&quot; or
&quot;register_command_parser&quot; statements, the
&quot;:parser&quot; rule option and the &quot;p_*&quot;
parser factory <br>
functions which get aliased to their parser class as
&quot;factory&quot;. The misnamed
&quot;register_scanner&quot; statement, &quot;:scanner&quot;
rule option and &quot;:scanner_*&quot; or
&quot;:parser_*&quot; functions <br>
are deprecated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; New variable
MAKEPP_VERSION.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; All internal
classes have been moved to the new package &quot;Mpp::&quot;
so as to abide by CPAN rules, and to avoid potential
collision with any module you might load into your <br>
makefiles. This is transparent to casual users of
makepp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In case you did Perl programming
for your makefiles, and you made use of some internals this
would break your build. Therefore there is a temporary
backward compatibility <br>
feature, to be removed in the future, which you can activate
during installation. The new environment variable
$MAKEPP_INSTALL_OLD_MODULES is checked for a list of old
<br>
modules you want created as wrappers around the new ones.
Additionally if you have makefiles you can&rsquo;t quickly
change, which rely on these things being available without a
<br>
&quot;use&quot; statement, you must prefix those modules
with a &quot;+&quot;, to get them preloaded:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">MAKEPP_INSTALL_OLD_MODULES=&rsquo;+Glob
Rule +MakeEvent&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; New
makeppreplay, mppr utility to repeat some of makepp&rsquo;s
actions very fast. New makepplog, mppl utility to see the
log data readably, needed due to a changed file format. <br>
New makeppgraph, mppg utility to graphically analyze
dependencies, includes and partially the reasons for a
rebuild. New makeppinfo, mppi utility to see somewhat
cryptically <br>
what makepp knows about some file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Ported to IBM
z/OS Unix System Services. Only smart recursive make
doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Makepp has
become noticeably faster.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Abolish the
undocumented fancy renaming of only &rsquo;.&rsquo; to
&rsquo;_dot_&rsquo; in variable and function names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; New variable $/
for portable directory separator. Lots of Windows fixes,
including &quot;-j&quot; (parallel builds) for Cygwin and
MinGW and smart recursive builds on Cygwin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Also install
abbreviations consisting of &rsquo;mpp&rsquo; plus the first
letter of every following word, e.g. &rsquo;mppc&rsquo; for
makeppclean.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; New
&lsquo;:build_check only_action&rsquo; for commands that
don&rsquo;t depend on the contents of their dependencies,
like symlink creation, where it is used automatically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Removed
&quot;--norc-substitution&quot; and
&quot;--percent-subdirs&quot; and
&quot;$(rc_substitution)&quot; and
&quot;percent_subdirs&quot;. They are now to be given
anywhere from target specific assignment to <br>
command line or environment vars
&quot;makepp_simple_concatenation&quot; and
&quot;makepp_percent_subdirs&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; New action
syntax &quot;&amp;perl_function &rsquo;arg 1&rsquo; arg2
...&quot; and &quot;&amp;external-perl-script &rsquo;arg
1&rsquo; arg2 ...&quot; New Perl function
&quot;run&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are the following builtin
commands: &amp;chmod, &amp;cp, &amp;cut, &amp;echo,
&amp;expr, &amp;grep, &amp;install, &amp;ln, &amp;mkdir,
&amp;mv, &amp;perl, &amp;preprocess, &amp;printf, &amp;rm,
&amp;sed, &amp;sort, &amp;template, <br>
&amp;touch, &amp;uninstall, &amp;uniq and &amp;yes, which
can replace Unix commands of the same name, and more or less
also the following: &quot;awk&quot;, &quot;chgrp&quot;,
&quot;chown&quot;, &quot;head&quot;, &quot;m4&quot;,
&quot;rmdir&quot;, <br>
&quot;tail&quot; and &quot;tr&quot;. They are also available
stand-alone from the Shell. They can also be used as
functions, e.g. &quot;$(&amp;cat file)&quot;, or as
statements, or standalone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that, unlike earlier CVS
versions, &quot;&amp;cut -f&quot;, &quot;&amp;grep -v&quot;
and &quot;&amp;sort -r&quot; now behave as in Unix. Note
that in earlier CVS versions of &amp;template &quot;@@&quot;
was processed before <br>
&quot;@&quot;, but now lines are consistently handled front
to back.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Added a
&quot;global&quot; statement for sharing variables across
makefiles. The assignment variant of &quot;export&quot; now
works like a normal assignment, so you may have to change to
&quot;:=&quot;. <br>
Added the &quot;override&quot; modifier to assignments. The
&quot;define var :=&quot; statement now optionally allows
specifying the kind of assignment. And the forms with
immediate evaluation <br>
retain the newlines in &quot;$(shell ...)&quot; or
&quot;$(&amp;command)&quot;. There are new assignment
operators &quot;&amp;=&quot; for prepending, and
&quot;;=&quot; which is a &quot;=&quot; when set, but
automatically turns <br>
into a &quot;:=&quot; when first used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A makefile is
now also found if it is called
&quot;Makeppfile.mk&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; There are two
new possible filenames for makefiles:
&quot;RootMakeppfile&quot; or equivalently
&quot;RootMakeppfile.mk&quot;. The presence of either of
these gives your build tree a formal <br>
root, accessible through the new variable
&quot;$(ROOT)&quot;. The advantage is that this file is
always loaded first, if present, allowing you to more easily
create a build system <br>
where makepp can be called from anywhere, without telling it
which makefile to start at.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The root of the file system is
then automatically marked for &quot;--dont-build&quot;, so
that makepp doesn&rsquo;t go messing into other directories
you include or use libs from, just <br>
because they happen to have a Makefile or sources.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Usually this means that the root
of your build system gets marked for &quot;--do-build&quot;.
If, however, you say &quot;--do-build&quot; for something
under your build system root, which <br>
doesn&rsquo;t inherit &quot;--dont-build&quot;, then instead
your build system root gets marked for
&quot;--dont-build&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Removed command
&quot;makeppclient&quot; since we never managed to let
builds start significantly faster. The option
&quot;--stop-after-loading&quot; is more beneficial.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Interface
definition files for SWIG (.i files) are now scanned for
includes. Makepp now understands swig invocations. (SWIG
stands for Simplified Wrapper and Interface <br>
Generator. It automatically generates all the wrapper
functions to link your C or C++ code to a variety of other
languages such as Perl, Python, Tcl, Ruby, OCaml, C#, etc.
<br>
See http://www.swig.org/.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; GNU Emacs 22 now
has a standard makefile-makepp-mode, which is the default
when visiting Makeppfile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; $[VARIABLE] or
$[function ...] is evaluated when reading a makefile line,
so the variable may contain makepp syntax.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; $( ...) is now
always a list in rc-style substitution, so that &quot;-I$(
$(DIRLIST))&quot; will leave no lonely option when DIRLIST
is empty.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; You can now
double-paren functions and multi-line lists, allowing things
like &quot;$((perl if( $a &lt; 5 ) { ... }))&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; New
&quot;c_compilation_md5&quot; signature, which also allows
adding whitespace where there was none and inversely. It
also ignores whitespace and comments after the last token.
<br>
This is useful for preventing a useless rebuild if your VC
adds lines at a &quot;$&quot;&quot;Log$&quot; tag when
checking in.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Implement $?
exactly as GNU make does. New long name
&quot;$(changed_inputs)&quot; for it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Implement
&quot;$(error ...)&quot; and &quot;$(warning ...)&quot; as
in GNU make.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; New method
&quot;: build_check ignore_action&quot; to ignore changes to
the action string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; New statements
&quot;ifperl&quot;, &quot;ifmakeperl&quot;,
&quot;iftrue&quot;, &quot;ifntrue&quot;, &quot;ifsys&quot;
and &quot;ifnsys&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Conditionals
&quot;ifxxx&quot; may now be grouped with &quot;and&quot;
and &quot;or&quot;. When written on the same line after
&quot;else&quot;, they create a branch of the same
statement, rather than requiring <br>
nesting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Added support
for dependencies on environment variables, using the
&quot;:env&quot; rule option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Various signal
handling fixes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; New command
&quot;makeppclean&quot; that efficiently removes generated
files without loading makefiles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Ported to
MinGW.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; New build
caches, to cache files that are identical. This means that
if you change a file and revert, then you can have makepp
drop back to the immediately preceding .o file <br>
without rebuilding. Or you can share builds of identical
files between separate source trees. Newly added grouping of
build caches for big setups, possibly spanning several <br>
machines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; At least Perl
5.6 is required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Version 1.40 (December 2004)
<br>
Thanks to Anders Johnson and Daniel Pfeiffer for major
contributions of code to this release.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Too many bug
fixes to list individually. Probably the most salient fixes
are to make it work significantly more reliably on Cygwin,
but there were also fixes to variable <br>
expansion, scanning, repositories, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Rewritten
command parser and file scanner architecture so that it is
more easily extensible. Makepp now supports Verilog (a
language used for chip design) in addition to C++ <br>
and Fortran. It should be relatively straightforward to
support additional languages. (Anders Johnson)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; New command
&quot;makeppclient&quot; that lets builds start faster.
(Daniel Pfeiffer)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If you have Perl
5.6.0 or higher, HTML documentation now comes with the new
working camel logo and syntax highlighting in the examples.
(Daniel Pfeiffer)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Numerous
corrections and improvements to the documentation. (Mostly
Anders Johnson)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Support for GNU
make&rsquo;s &quot;define&quot; statement to define
multi-line variable values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; $(PWD) and
$(CURDIR) now work as in GNU make.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; New
&quot;--keep-repository-links&quot; option to prevent makepp
from deleting all the soft links it creates when making
repositories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; New
&quot;--assume-old&quot;, &quot;--assume-new&quot;, and
&quot;--dont-build&quot; options, and support for the
&quot;-n&quot; option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Support for
double colon rules has slightly improved, so that we can
handle makefiles produced by MakeMaker without much
trouble.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Added syntax for
performing Perl code as a statement and in rules &quot;perl
{ ... }&quot; or &quot;makeperl { ... }&quot;. Added
functions for evaluating Perl statements &quot;$(perl ...
)&quot; or <br>
&quot;$(makeperl ... )&quot;. Added statement &quot;makesub
{ ... }&quot;. (Daniel Pfeiffer)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Short options
can now be directly followed by argument as in -j4.
Documented options --jobs, --keep-going, --makefile,
--what-if, --assume-new, --new-file, --assume-old &amp; <br>
--old-file are now really accepted. (Daniel Pfeiffer)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Version 1.19 (July 2003) <br>
Special thanks to Matthew Lovell and Chris van Engelen for
lots of suggestions and tracking down problems in the
code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Documentation
was reorganized so that man pages as well as HTML pages can
be produced, and a cookbook/FAQ was added (see
makepp_cookbook).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A
&quot;configure&quot; script was added so installation is
more like other software products from the user point of
view.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The
&quot;$(origin )&quot; function from GNU make is now
supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Target-specific
variables are now supported as in GNU make, except that they
do not propagate their values to dependencies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; New functions
&quot;$(find_upwards )&quot; and &quot;$(relative_filename
)&quot; (contributed by Matthew Lovell) and
&quot;$(relative_to )&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; In compilation
commands, &quot;-I dir&quot; and &quot;-L dir&quot; are now
supported and work just like &quot;-Idir&quot; and
&quot;-Ldir&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Recompilation of
C files will now occur if a multi-line comment was inserted,
or if the line numbering changed in any way. Previously it
ignored newlines in computing the <br>
checksum, which meant that a change that affected debugger
info might not force a recompilation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A bug in
&quot;$(shell )&quot; which caused it to return a null
string occasionally (especially when the system was heavily
loaded) was fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Unreadable files
or directories suppress importing from repositories but are
not matched by wildcards.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A few other
minor bugs were fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Version 1.18 (January 2002) <br>
The most important change was support for the Cygwin build
environment. You can now run makepp with the Cygwin version
of Perl; I do not think it will work properly with the <br>
native Windows version of Perl yet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A few other bug fixes went into
this release.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Version 1.10 (February 2001)
<br>
The most important change in this version is that makepp can
accept a vastly larger number of makefiles without any
command line options because of some changes to the <br>
implementation of recursive make. There are a few minor
improvements in the GNU make compatibility, and a slight
improvement in memory usage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are several user visible
changes:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;c_compilation_md5&quot; is now the default signature
method. This means that by default, makepp won&rsquo;t
recompile C/C++ modules if only whitespace or comments have
changed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A new signature
method &quot;md5&quot; has been added, which runs an MD5
checksum on the file&rsquo;s contents. This is not enabled
by default; makepp still uses its original method <br>
(&quot;exact_match&quot;) for any files other than C/C++
source files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Because of these changes, makepp
will recompile everything the first time you run it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Version 1.05 <br>
In addition to bug-fixes, this version has one user-visible
change. The &quot;--norc-substitution&quot; command line
option was introduced to allow compatible handling of
whitespace in <br>
makefiles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Version 0.99 (January 2001) <br>
In addition to numerous bug fixes, this version has several
user-visible changes:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Multiple targets
for a rule are now treated in a way which is more compatible
with old makefiles. Makepp has a heuristic algorithm for
guessing whether the rule is supposed <br>
to build all targets at once or whether the rule needs to be
invoked multiple times. I do not think this will break any
existing makefiles, but it should allow makepp to <br>
work with many more makefiles designed for Unix make.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The
&quot;--traditional-recursive-make&quot; option can be used
for legacy makefiles which use recursive invocations of make
in a way that didn&rsquo;t work with makepp&rsquo;s default
<br>
implementation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Repositories now
work with libtool.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Variable
settings are now allowed with the &quot;load_makefile&quot;
statement and with recursive make.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Version 0.95 <br>
This version has several user-visible changes:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A tutorial on
writing makefiles for makepp has been added.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; GNU make style
conditionals (ifeq/ifneq/ifdef/ifndef) are now supported, as
is the &quot;$(if )&quot; function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; By default, the
&quot;%&quot; wildcard now matches only files within a
directory; &quot;%.c&quot; is now equivalent to
&quot;*.c&quot;, not &quot;**/*.c&quot;. The reason for this
change was that rules almost <br>
never need to use the more complicated wildcard, and it
often caused unnecessary directories to be searched. You can
get the old behavior by specifying
&quot;--percent-subdirs&quot; <br>
on the command line. (I&rsquo;m curious how people feel
about this change. Please let me know if you have good
reasons for it being one way or the other.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; By default,
makefiles from any directory that contains a dependency, or
that is searched by a wildcard, are loaded automatically.
Usually this means you don&rsquo;t need any <br>
&quot;load_makefile&quot; statements at all. If this causes
you problems, you can turn off implicit loading of makefiles
by adding &quot;--no-implicit-load&quot; to the command
line. (I&rsquo;m <br>
curious whether people like or dislike implicit loading of
makefiles.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A target may now
be declared phony on the same line that defines the target
by using the new &quot;$(phony )&quot; function, like
this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$(phony all): program_1
program_2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;$(phony )&quot;
function simply returns its arguments, but marks them as
phony targets. You can still use the older syntax that looks
like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">all: program_1 program_2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">.PHONY: all</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;$(phony )&quot;
function is an attempt to improve the readability of
makefiles. I&rsquo;d welcome other suggestions, as I&rsquo;m
still not entirely happy with the syntax.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Version 0.90 <br>
In order to support features like parallel make, most of the
internals had to be reorganized or rewritten. The result is
much cleaner and hopefully more reliable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bugs too numerous to mention
have been fixed. In order to help ensure reliability, a test
suite has been developed. It doesn&rsquo;t test absolutely
everything yet, but it does test <br>
most things, and I hope to make it more extensive in the
future. You can run it by typing &quot;makepp test&quot; in
the makepp distribution directory. If an unmodified makepp
fails the <br>
test suite, please let me know so I can fix it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are many new features:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Repositories are
now supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; It is now
possible to specify different methods for calculating and
comparing file signatures. For example, you can use an MD5
checksum ignoring comments and whitespace, or <br>
you can require merely that the target be newer than the
dependencies (the method that the traditional make
uses).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Makefiles are
only rebuilt if they are older than their dependencies; a
different signature method is used in this special case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Parallel builds
are now supported, though this is still an experimental
feature. See the &quot;-j&quot; option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; It is now
possible to write your own functions. See the
&quot;sub&quot; statement and makepp_extending for
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Filenames with
characters like colon or space are now supported with a new
quoting syntax.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Synonymous, less
cryptic names for automatic variables have been introduced
to encourage more readable makefiles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Makepp now
remembers the architecture of the machine you built on, and
rebuilds if the architecture is different.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Directories can
now be targets or dependencies; a previous restriction that
all directories had to exist before the start of the build
has been lifted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Makepp now
writes a log file called &quot;.makepp_log&quot; explaining
why it rebuilt everything. This is extremely useful for
debugging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The usual
&quot;-k&quot; option for continuing to build even when an
error occurs is now supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The
documentation has been reorganized and extended.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are also (unfortunately) a
few incompatibilities with previous versions:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The file format
for storing information about the last build has changed.
Thus makepp will insist on rebuilding everything the first
time you run the new version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; load_makefile no
longer supports targets or variable settings. It now
supports loading a list of makefiles rather than just one,
so the &quot;-F&quot; switch is now unnecessary (and <br>
no longer documented).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Recursive make
now ignores variable settings on the command line. This is
necessary to load makefiles in a consistent way.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;$(INFERRED_OBJS)&quot; is no longer supported (since
it was not a well-designed interface anyway). Use the newer
&quot;$(infer_objects)&quot; function instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; $_ is no longer
supported. Use &quot;$(foreach)&quot; instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A few seldom
used GNU make options such as &quot;-s&quot;,
&quot;-n&quot;, and &quot;-q&quot; are no longer supported
due to internal architecture changes. &quot;-n&quot; will
probably be supported again in future <br>
releases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A man page is no
longer provided since the documentation is no longer written
in the Perl pod format. Use the HTML documentation
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The automatic
clean target is no longer supported. A better way to do it
is with &quot;$(only_targets)&quot;.</p>
