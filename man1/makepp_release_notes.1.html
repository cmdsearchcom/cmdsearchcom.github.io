      responsible for expanding your arguments. Use the accessor functions
      &amp;arg or &quot;args&quot; described in makepp extensions. Until you get
      round to updating your functions, you can turn this off by setting
      &quot;$Mpp::Makefile::legacy_functions = 1&quot; either in your makefile
      (one per build system is enough, as it's a Perl variable) or patch it into
      your new makepp installation. If you want your updated functions to work
      with both your old and this new makepp, use &quot;ref $_[0] ? &amp;arg :

    In case you did Perl programming for your makefiles, and you made use of
      some internals this would break your build. Therefore there is a temporary
      backward compatibility feature, to be removed in the future, which you can
      activate during installation. The new environment variable
      $MAKEPP_INSTALL_OLD_MODULES is checked for a list of old modules you want
      created as wrappers around the new ones. Additionally if you have
      makefiles you can't quickly change, which rely on these things being
      available without a &quot;use&quot; statement, you must prefix those

  <dd class="It-tag">There are two new possible filenames for makefiles:

      The presence of either of these gives your build tree a formal root,
      accessible through the new variable &quot;$(ROOT)&quot;. The advantage is
      that this file is always loaded first, if present, allowing you to more
      easily create a build system where makepp can be called from anywhere,
      without telling it which makefile to start at.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The root of the file system is then automatically marked for
      &quot;--dont-build&quot;, so that makepp doesn't go messing into other
      directories you include or use libs from, just because they happen to have
      a Makefile or sources.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Usually this means that the root of your build system gets marked for

  1.18 (January 2002)</a></h2>
The most important change was support for the Cygwin build environment. You can
  now run makepp with the Cygwin version of Perl; I do not think it will work
  properly with the native Windows version of Perl yet.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A few other bug fixes went into this release.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Version_1.10_(February_2001)"><a class="selflink" href="#Version_1.10_(February_2001)">Version
  1.10 (February 2001)</a></h2>
The most important change in this version is that makepp can accept a vastly
  larger number of makefiles without any command line options because of some
  changes to the implementation of recursive make. There are a few minor
  improvements in the GNU make compatibility, and a slight improvement in memory
  usage.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There are several user visible changes:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">&quot;c_compilation_md5&quot; is now the default signature
      method. This means that by default, makepp won't recompile C/C++ modules
      if only whitespace or comments have changed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">A new signature method &quot;md5&quot; has been added,
      which runs an MD5 checksum on the file's contents. This is not enabled by
      default; makepp still uses its original method (&quot;exact_match&quot;)
      for any files other than C/C++ source files.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Because of these changes, makepp will recompile everything the first time you
  run it.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Version_1.05"><a class="selflink" href="#Version_1.05">Version
  1.05</a></h2>
In addition to bug-fixes, this version has one user-visible change. The
  &quot;--norc-substitution&quot; command line option was introduced to allow
  compatible handling of whitespace in makefiles.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Version_0.99_(January_2001)"><a class="selflink" href="#Version_0.99_(January_2001)">Version
  0.99 (January 2001)</a></h2>
In addition to numerous bug fixes, this version has several user-visible
  changes:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Multiple targets for a rule are now treated in a way which
      is more compatible with old makefiles. Makepp has a heuristic algorithm
      for guessing whether the rule is supposed to build all targets at once or
      whether the rule needs to be invoked multiple times. I do not think this
      will break any existing makefiles, but it should allow makepp to work with
      many more makefiles designed for Unix make.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The &quot;--traditional-recursive-make&quot; option can be

</dl>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Version_0.95"><a class="selflink" href="#Version_0.95">Version

This version has several user-visible changes:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">A tutorial on writing makefiles for makepp has been
    added.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">By default, the &quot;%&quot; wildcard now matches only
      files within a directory; &quot;%.c&quot; is now equivalent to
      &quot;*.c&quot;, not &quot;**/*.c&quot;. The reason for this change was
      that rules almost never need to use the more complicated wildcard, and it
      often caused unnecessary directories to be searched. You can get the old
      behavior by specifying &quot;--percent-subdirs&quot; on the command line.
      (I'm curious how people feel about this change. Please let me know if you
      have good reasons for it being one way or the other.)</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">By default, makefiles from any directory that contains a
      dependency, or that is searched by a wildcard, are loaded automatically.
      Usually this means you don't need any &quot;load_makefile&quot; statements
      at all. If this causes you problems, you can turn off implicit loading of
      makefiles by adding &quot;--no-implicit-load&quot; to the command line.
      (I'm curious whether people like or dislike implicit loading of
      makefiles.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">A target may now be declared phony on the same line that
      defines the target by using the new &quot;$(phony&#x00A0;)&quot; function,
      like this:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    $(phony all): program_1 program_2
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The &quot;$(phony&#x00A0;)&quot; function simply returns its arguments, but
      marks them as phony targets. You can still use the older syntax that looks
      like this:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    all: program_1 program_2
    .PHONY: all
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The &quot;$(phony&#x00A0;)&quot; function is an attempt to improve the
      readability of makefiles. I'd welcome other suggestions, as I'm still not
      entirely happy with the syntax.</dd>
</dl>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Version_0.90"><a class="selflink" href="#Version_0.90">Version
  0.90</a></h2>
In order to support features like parallel make, most of the internals had to be
  reorganized or rewritten. The result is much cleaner and hopefully more
  reliable.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Bugs too numerous to mention have been fixed. In order to help ensure
  reliability, a test suite has been developed. It doesn't test absolutely
  everything yet, but it does test most things, and I hope to make it more
  extensive in the future. You can run it by typing &quot;makepp test&quot; in
  the makepp distribution directory. If an unmodified makepp fails the test
  suite, please let me know so I can fix it.
