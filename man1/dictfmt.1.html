<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
dictfmt - formats a DICT protocol dictionary database</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
dictfmt -c5|-t|-e|-f|-h|-j|-p [options] basename <br>
dictfmt -i|-I [options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
dictfmt takes a file, FILE, on stdin, and creates a
dictionary database named basename.dict, that conforms to
the DICT protocol. It also creates an index file named
base&acirc; <br>
name.index. By default, the index is sorted according to the
C locale, and only alphanumeric characters and spaces are
used in sorting, however this may be changed with the <br>
--locale and --allchars options. ( basename is commonly
chosen to correspond to the basename of FILE , but this is
not mandatory.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unless the database is extremely
small, it is highly recommended that basename.dict be
compressed with /usr/bin/dictzip to create basename.dict.dz.
(dictzip is included in the <br>
dictd source package.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILE may be in any of the
several formats described by the format options -c5, -t, -e,
-f, -h, -j, -p, -i or -I. Exactly one of these options must
be given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dictfmt prepends several headers
are to the .dict file. The 00-database-url header gives the
value of the -u option as the URL of the site from which the
original database was <br>
obtained. The 00-database-short header gives the value of
the -s option as the short name of the dictionary. (This
&quot;short name&quot; is the identifying name given by the
&quot;dict- D&quot; <br>
option.) If the -u and/or -s options are omitted, these
values will be shown as &quot;unknown&quot;, which is
undesirable for a publicly distributed database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The date of conversion
(formatting) is given in the 00-database-info header. All
text in the input file prior to the first headword (as
defined by the appropriate formatting <br>
option) is appended to this header. All text in the input
file following a headword, up to the next headword, is
copied unchanged to the .dict file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FORMATTING OPTIONS <br>
-c5 FILE is formatted with headwords preceded by 5 or more
underscore characters (_) and a blank line. All text until
the next headword is considered the definition. Any <br>
leading &lsquo;@&rsquo; characters are stripped out, but the
file is otherwise unchanged. This option was written to
format the CIA WORLD FACTBOOK 1995.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t -c5, --without-info and
--without-headword options are implied. Use this option, if
an input database comes from dictunformat utility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e FILE is in html format, with
the headword tagged as bold. (&lt;B&gt;headword -
&lt;/B&gt;) <br>
This option was written to format EASTON&rsquo;S 1897 BIBLE
DICTIONARY. A typical entry from Easton is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;A
NAME=&quot;T0000005&quot;&gt; <br>
&lt;B&gt;Abagtha - &lt;/B&gt; <br>
one of the seven eunuchs in Ahasuerus&rsquo;s court (Esther
1:10; 2:21).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is converted to: <br>
Abagtha <br>
one of the seven eunuchs in Ahasuerus&rsquo;s court (Esther
1:10; 2:21).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The heading &quot;&lt;A
NAME=&quot;T0000005&quot;&gt; is omitted, and the headword
&lsquo;Abagtha&rsquo; is indexed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: This option should be used
with caution. It removes several html tags (enough to format
Easton properly), but not all. The Makefile that was
originally written to <br>
format dict-easton uses sed scripts to modify certain cross
reference tags. It may be necessary to pipe the input file
through a sed script, or hack the source of dictfmt <br>
in order to properly format other html databases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f FILE is formatted with the
headwords starting in column 0, with the definition indented
at least one space (or tab character) on subsequent lines.
The third line starting <br>
in column 0 is taken as the first headword , and the first
two lines starting in column 0 are treated as part of the
00-database-info header. This option was written to <br>
format the F.O.L.D.O.C.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h FILE is formatted with the
headwords starting in column 0, followed by a comma, with
the definition continuing on the same line. All text before
the first single charac&acirc; <br>
ter line is included in 00-database-info header, and lines
with only one character are omitted from the .dict file. The
first headword is on the line following the first <br>
single character line. The headword is indexed; the text of
the file is not changed. This option was written to format
HITCHCOCK&rsquo;S BIBLE NAMES DICTIONARY.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-j FILE is formatted with
headwords starting in col 0, enclosed in colons, followed by
the definition. The colons surrounding the headword are
removed, and the headword is <br>
indexed. Lines beginning with &rsquo;*&rsquo;,
&rsquo;=&rsquo;, or &rsquo;-&rsquo; are also removed. All
text before the first headword is included in the headers.
This option was written to format the <br>
JARGON FILE. <br>
NOTE: Some recent versions of the JARGON FILE had three
blanks inserted before the first colon at each headword.
These must be removed before processing with dictfmt. <br>
(sed scripts have been used for this purpose. ed, awk, or
perl scripts are also possible.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p FILE is formatted with
&lsquo;%h&rsquo; in column 0, followed by a blank, followed
by the headword, optionally followed by a line containing
&lsquo;%d&rsquo; in column 0. The definition starts <br>
on the following line. The first line beginning
&Acirc;&acute;%h&Acirc;&acute; and any lines beginning
&rsquo;%d&rsquo; are stripped from the .dict file, and
&rsquo;%h &rsquo; is stripped from in front of the headword.
<br>
All text before the first headword is included in the
headers. The second line beginning &rsquo;%h&rsquo; is taken
as the first headword. <br>
This option was written to format Jay Kominek&rsquo;s
elements database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i -I These two options are
different from all other formatting options. They are
intended to resort (according to dictd requirement) an
.index file given on stdin. That is <br>
.dict file is not generated at all. Only resorting is made.
Three- or four-column .index like input is expected. -i
expects decimal offset and length, while -I expects <br>
them in base64 format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-u url Specifies the URL of the site from which the raw
database was obtained. If this option is specified,
00-database-url headword and appropriate definition will be
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s name <br>
Specifies the name and, optionally, the version and date, of
the database. (If this contains spaces, it must be quoted.)
If this option is specified, 00-database-short <br>
headword and appropriate definition will be ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L display license and copyright
information</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V display version
information</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D output debugging
information</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help display a help
message</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--locale locale <br>
Specifies the locale used for sorting. If no locale is
specified, the &quot;C&quot; locale is used. For using UTF-8
mode, --utf8 is needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--8bit generates database in
8-bit mode, see --locale option also. <br>
Note: This option is deprecated. Use it for creating 8-bit
(non-UTF8) dictionaries only. In order to create UTF-8
dictionary, use --utf8 option instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--utf8 If specified, UTF-8
database is created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--allchars <br>
Specifies that all characters should be used for the search,
by default only alphabetic, numeric characters and spaces
are put to .index file and therefore are used in <br>
search. Creates the special entry 00-database-allchars.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--case-sensitive <br>
makes the search case sensitive. Creates the special entry
00-database-case-sensitive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--headword-separator sep <br>
sets the headword separator, which allows several words to
have the same definition. For example, if
&Acirc;&acute;--headword-separator %%%&rsquo; is given, and
the input file contains <br>
&Acirc;&acute;autumn%%%fall&rsquo;, both
&rsquo;autumn&rsquo; and &rsquo;fall&rsquo; will be indexed
as headwords, with the same definition.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--index-data-separator sep <br>
sets the index/data separator, which allows one to set the
first and fourth columns of .index file independently. That
is the first column can be treated as an index col&acirc;
<br>
umn (where the MATCH command searches) and the fourth column
as a result column (where the MATCH gets things to be
returned), and they (1-st and 4-th columns) are com&acirc;
<br>
pletely independent of each other. The default value for
this separator is ASCII symbol &quot; 34&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--break-headwords <br>
multiple headwords will be written on separate lines in the
.dict file. For use with &rsquo;--headword-separator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--index-keep-orig <br>
When --utf-8 is specified headwords are lowercased and
non-alphanumeric characters are removed from it before
saving to .index file in order to simplify the search. When
<br>
--index-keep-orig option is used fourth column is created
(if necessary) in .index file, and contains an original
headword which is returned by MATCH command. This option
<br>
may be useful to prevent converting &quot; AT&amp;T&quot; to
&quot; ATT&quot; or to keep proper nouns with uppercased
first letter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--without-headword <br>
headwords will not be included in .dict file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--without-header <br>
header will not be copied to DB info entry</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--without-url <br>
URL will not be copied to DB info entry</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--without-time <br>
time of creation will not be copied to DB info entry</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--without-ver <br>
By default dictfmt creates a special entry
00-database-dictfmt-X.Y.Z that contains (in .dict file)
dictfmt version in format dictfmt-X.Y.Z. This option
suppresses this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--without-info <br>
DB info entry will not be created. This may be useful if
00-database-info headword is expected from stdin
(dictunformat outputs it).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--columns columns <br>
By default dictfmt wraps strings read from stdin to 72
columns. This option changes this default. If it is set to
zero or negative value, wrapping is off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--default-strategy strategy <br>
Sets the default search strategy for the database. It will
be used instead of strategy &rsquo;.&rsquo;. Special entry
00-database-default-strategy is created for this purpose.
This <br>
option may be useful, for example, for dictionaries
containing mainly phrases but the single words. In any case,
use this option if you are absolutely sure what you are <br>
doing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--mime-header mime_header <br>
When client sends OPTION MIME command to the dictd ,
definitions found in this database are prepended by the
specified MIME header. Creates the special entry
00-data&acirc; <br>
base-mime-header.</p>
