<p>PERL583DELTA(1) Perl Programmers Reference Guide
PERL583DELTA(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
perl583delta - what is new for perl v5.8.3</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This document describes differences between the 5.8.2
release and the 5.8.3 release.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are upgrading from an
earlier release such as 5.6.1, first read the perl58delta,
which describes differences between 5.6.0 and 5.8.0, and the
perl581delta and <br>
perl582delta, which describe differences between 5.8.0,
5.8.1 and 5.8.2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Incompatible Changes <br>
There are no changes incompatible with 5.8.2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Core Enhancements <br>
A &quot;SCALAR&quot; method is now available for tied
hashes. This is called when a tied hash is used in scalar
context, such as</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if (%tied_hash) { <br>
... <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The old behaviour was that
%tied_hash would return whatever would have been returned
for that hash before the hash was tied (so usually 0). The
new behaviour in the absence of a <br>
SCALAR method is to return TRUE if in the middle of an
&quot;each&quot; iteration, and otherwise call FIRSTKEY to
check if the hash is empty (making sure that a subsequent
&quot;each&quot; will also <br>
begin by calling FIRSTKEY). Please see &quot;SCALAR&quot; in
perltie for the full details and caveats.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Modules and Pragmata <br>
CGI <br>
Cwd <br>
Digest <br>
Digest::MD5 <br>
Encode <br>
File::Spec <br>
FindBin <br>
A function &quot;again&quot; is provided to resolve problems
where modules in different directories wish to use
FindBin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">List::Util <br>
You can now weaken references to read only values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Math::BigInt <br>
PodParser <br>
Pod::Perldoc <br>
POSIX <br>
Unicode::Collate <br>
Unicode::Normalize <br>
Test::Harness <br>
threads::shared <br>
&quot;cond_wait&quot; has a new two argument form.
&quot;cond_timedwait&quot; has been added.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Utility Changes <br>
&quot;find2perl&quot; now assumes &quot;-print&quot; as a
default action. Previously, it needed to be specified
explicitly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A new utility,
&quot;prove&quot;, makes it easy to run an individual
regression test at the command line. &quot;prove&quot; is
part of Test::Harness, which users of earlier Perl versions
can install <br>
from CPAN.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">New Documentation <br>
The documentation has been revised in places to produce more
standard manpages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The documentation for the
special code blocks (BEGIN, CHECK, INIT, END) has been
improved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Installation and Configuration
Improvements <br>
Perl now builds on OpenVMS I64</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Selected Bug Fixes <br>
Using substr() on a UTF8 string could cause subsequent
accesses on that string to return garbage. This was due to
incorrect UTF8 offsets being cached, and is now fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">join() could return garbage when
the same join() statement was used to process 8 bit data
having earlier processed UTF8 data, due to the flags on that
statement&rsquo;s temporary <br>
workspace not being reset correctly. This is now fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;$a .. $b&quot; will now
work as expected when either $a or $b is
&quot;undef&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using Unicode keys with tied
hashes should now work correctly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Reading $^E now preserves $!.
Previously, the C code implementing $^E did not preserve
&quot;errno&quot;, so reading $^E could cause
&quot;errno&quot; and therefore $! to change
unexpectedly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Reentrant functions will (once
more) work with C++. 5.8.2 introduced a bugfix which
accidentally broke the compilation of Perl extensions
written in C++</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">New or Changed Diagnostics <br>
The fatal error &quot;DESTROY created new reference to dead
object&quot; is now documented in perldiag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Changed Internals <br>
The hash code has been refactored to reduce source
duplication. The external interface is unchanged, and aside
from the bug fixes described above, there should be no
change in <br>
behaviour.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;hv_clear_placeholders&quot;
is now part of the perl API</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some C macros have been tidied.
In particular macros which create temporary local variables
now name these variables more defensively, which should
avoid bugs where names clash.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;signal.h&gt; is now always
included.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Configuration and Building <br>
&quot;Configure&quot; now invokes callbacks regardless of
the value of the variable they are called for. Previously
callbacks were only invoked in the &quot;case $variable
$define)&quot; branch. <br>
This change should only affect platform maintainers writing
configuration hints files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Platform Specific Problems <br>
The regression test ext/threads/shared/t/wait.t fails on
early RedHat 9 and HP-UX 10.20 due to bugs in their
threading implementations. RedHat users should see <br>
https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2003-136.html and
consider upgrading their glibc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Known Problems <br>
Detached threads aren&rsquo;t supported on Windows yet, as
they may lead to memory access violation problems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is a known race condition
opening scripts in &quot;suidperl&quot;.
&quot;suidperl&quot; is neither built nor installed by
default, and has been deprecated since perl 5.8.0. You are
advised to <br>
replace use of suidperl with tools such as sudo (
http://www.courtesan.com/sudo/ )</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">We have a backlog of unresolved
bugs. Dealing with bugs and bug reports is unglamorous work;
not something ideally suited to volunteer labour, but that
is all that we have.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The perl5 development team are
implementing changes to help address this problem, which
should go live in early 2004.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Future Directions <br>
Code freeze for the next maintenance release (5.8.4) is on
March 31st 2004, with release expected by mid April.
Similarly 5.8.5&rsquo;s freeze will be at the end of June,
with release <br>
by mid July.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Obituary <br>
Iain &rsquo;Spoon&rsquo; Truskett, Perl hacker, author of
perlreref and contributor to CPAN, died suddenly on 29th
December 2003, aged 24. He will be missed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Reporting Bugs <br>
If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the
articles recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc
newsgroup and the perl bug database at http://bugs.perl.org.
There <br>
may also be information at http://www.perl.org, the Perl
Home Page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you believe you have an
unreported bug, please run the perlbug program included with
your release. Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case. Your bug <br>
report, along with the output of &quot;perl -V&quot;, will
be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl
porting team. You can browse and search the Perl 5 bugs at
<br>
http://bugs.perl.org/</p>
