perl583delta - what is new for perl v5.8.3
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
This document describes differences between the 5.8.2 release and the 5.8.3
  release.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.6.1, first read the
  perl58delta, which describes differences between 5.6.0 and 5.8.0, and the
  perl581delta and perl582delta, which describe differences between 5.8.0, 5.8.1
  and 5.8.2
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Incompatible_Changes"><a class="selflink" href="#Incompatible_Changes">Incompatible
  Changes</a></h1>
There are no changes incompatible with 5.8.2.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Core_Enhancements"><a class="selflink" href="#Core_Enhancements">Core
  Enhancements</a></h1>
A &quot;SCALAR&quot; method is now available for tied hashes. This is called
  when a tied hash is used in scalar context, such as
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    if (%tied_hash) {
        ...
    }
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The old behaviour was that %tied_hash would return whatever would have been
  returned for that hash before the hash was tied (so usually 0). The new
  behaviour in the absence of a SCALAR method is to return TRUE if in the middle
  of an &quot;each&quot; iteration, and otherwise call FIRSTKEY to check if the
  hash is empty (making sure that a subsequent &quot;each&quot; will also begin
  by calling FIRSTKEY). Please see &quot;SCALAR&quot; in perltie for the full
  details and caveats.

&quot;find2perl&quot; now assumes &quot;-print&quot; as a default action.
  Previously, it needed to be specified explicitly.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A new utility, &quot;prove&quot;, makes it easy to run an individual regression
  test at the command line. &quot;prove&quot; is part of Test::Harness, which
  users of earlier Perl versions can install from CPAN.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="New_Documentation"><a class="selflink" href="#New_Documentation">New
  Documentation</a></h1>
The documentation has been revised in places to produce more standard manpages.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The documentation for the special code blocks (BEGIN, CHECK, INIT, END) has been
  improved.

Perl now builds on OpenVMS I64
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Selected_Bug_Fixes"><a class="selflink" href="#Selected_Bug_Fixes">Selected
  Bug Fixes</a></h1>
Using <i>substr()</i> on a UTF8 string could cause subsequent accesses on that
  string to return garbage. This was due to incorrect UTF8 offsets being cached,
  and is now fixed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>join()</i> could return garbage when the same <i>join()</i> statement was
  used to process 8 bit data having earlier processed UTF8 data, due to the
  flags on that statement's temporary workspace not being reset correctly. This
  is now fixed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;$a .. $b&quot; will now work as expected when either $a or $b is
  &quot;undef&quot;
<div class="Pp"></div>
Using Unicode keys with tied hashes should now work correctly.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Reading $^E now preserves $!. Previously, the C code implementing $^E did not
  preserve &quot;errno&quot;, so reading $^E could cause &quot;errno&quot; and
  therefore $! to change unexpectedly.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Reentrant functions will (once more) work with C++. 5.8.2 introduced a bugfix
  which accidentally broke the compilation of Perl extensions written in C++
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="New_or_Changed_Diagnostics"><a class="selflink" href="#New_or_Changed_Diagnostics">New
  or Changed Diagnostics</a></h1>
The fatal error &quot;DESTROY created new reference to dead object&quot; is now
  documented in perldiag.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Changed_Internals"><a class="selflink" href="#Changed_Internals">Changed
  Internals</a></h1>
The hash code has been refactored to reduce source duplication. The external
  interface is unchanged, and aside from the bug fixes described above, there
  should be no change in behaviour.
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;hv_clear_placeholders&quot; is now part of the perl API
<div class="Pp"></div>
Some C macros have been tidied. In particular macros which create temporary
  local variables now name these variables more defensively, which should avoid
  bugs where names clash.
<div class="Pp"></div>
&lt;signal.h&gt; is now always included.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Configuration_and_Building"><a class="selflink" href="#Configuration_and_Building">Configuration
  and Building</a></h1>
&quot;Configure&quot; now invokes callbacks regardless of the value of the
  variable they are called for. Previously callbacks were only invoked in the
  &quot;case $variable $define)&quot; branch. This change should only affect
  platform maintainers writing configuration hints files.

The regression test ext/threads/shared/t/wait.t fails on early RedHat 9 and
  HP-UX 10.20 due to bugs in their threading implementations. RedHat users
  should see https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2003-136.html and consider
  upgrading their glibc.

Detached threads aren't supported on Windows yet, as they may lead to memory
  access violation problems.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There is a known race condition opening scripts in &quot;suidperl&quot;.
  &quot;suidperl&quot; is neither built nor installed by default, and has been
  deprecated since perl 5.8.0. You are advised to replace use of suidperl with
  tools such as sudo ( http://www.courtesan.com/sudo/ )
<div class="Pp"></div>
We have a backlog of unresolved bugs. Dealing with bugs and bug reports is
  unglamorous work; not something ideally suited to volunteer labour, but that
  is all that we have.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The perl5 development team are implementing changes to help address this
  problem, which should go live in early 2004.

Code freeze for the next maintenance release (5.8.4) is on March 31st 2004, with
  release expected by mid April. Similarly 5.8.5's freeze will be at the end of
  June, with release by mid July.

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently
  posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at
  http://bugs.perl.org. There may also be information at http://www.perl.org,
  the Perl Home Page.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the <b>perlbug</b> program
  included with your release. Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
  sufficient test case. Your bug report, along with the output of &quot;perl
  -V&quot;, will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl
  porting team. You can browse and search the Perl 5 bugs at
  http://bugs.perl.org/
