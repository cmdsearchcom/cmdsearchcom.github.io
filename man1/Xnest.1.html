<p>Xnest(1) General Commands Manual Xnest(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
Xnest - a nested X server</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
Xnest [ options ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Xnest is both an X client and an X server. Xnest is a client
of the real server which manages windows and graphics
requests on its behalf. Xnest is a server to its own
clients. <br>
Xnest manages windows and graphics requests on their behalf.
To these clients, Xnest appears to be a conventional
server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Xnest supports all standard options of the sample server
implementation. For more details, please see Xserver(1). The
following additional arguments are supported as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-display string <br>
This option specifies the display name of the real server
that Xnest should try to connect to. If it is not provided
on the command line, Xnest will read the DISPLAY <br>
environment variable in order to find out this
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sync This option tells Xnest to
synchronize its window and graphics operations with the real
server. This is a useful option for debugging, but it will
slow down Xnest&rsquo;s per&acirc; <br>
formance considerably. It should not be used unless
absolutely necessary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-full This option tells Xnest to
utilize full regeneration of real server objects and reopen
a new connection to the real server each time the nested
server regenerates. The <br>
sample server implementation regenerates all objects in the
server when the last client of this server terminates. When
this happens, Xnest by default maintains the same <br>
top-level window and the same real server connection in each
new generation. If the user selects full regeneration, even
the top-level window and the connection to the <br>
real server will be regenerated for each server
generation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-class string <br>
This option specifies the default visual class of the nested
server. It is similar to the -cc option from the set of
standard options except that it will accept a string <br>
rather than a number for the visual class specification. The
string must be one of the following six values: StaticGray,
GrayScale, StaticColor, PseudoColor, TrueColor, <br>
or DirectColor. If both the -class and -cc options are
specified, the last instance of either option takes
precedence. The class of the default visual of the nested
<br>
server need not be the same as the class of the default
visual of the real server, but it must be supported by the
real server. Use xdpyinfo(1) to obtain a list of sup&acirc;
<br>
ported visual classes on the real server before starting
Xnest. If the user chooses a static class, all the colors in
the default color map will be preallocated. If the <br>
user chooses a dynamic class, colors in the default color
map will be available to individual clients for
allocation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-depth int <br>
This option specifies the default visual depth of the nested
server. The depth of the default visual of the nested server
need not be the same as the depth of the default <br>
visual of the real server, but it must be supported by the
real server. Use xdpyinfo(1) to obtain a list of supported
visual depths on the real server before starting <br>
Xnest.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sss This option tells Xnest to
use the software screen saver. By default, Xnest will use
the screen saver that corresponds to the hardware screen
saver in the real server. <br>
Of course, even this screen saver is software-generated
since Xnest does not control any actual hardware. However,
it is treated as a hardware screen saver within the <br>
sample server code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-geometry WxH+X+Y <br>
This option specifies the geometry parameters for the
top-level Xnest window. See &acirc;GEOMETRY
SPECIFICATIONS&acirc; in X(7) for a discusson of this
option&rsquo;s syntax. This window <br>
corresponds to the root window of the nested server. The
width W and height H specified with this option will be the
maximum width and height of each top-level Xnest win&acirc;
<br>
dow. Xnest will allow the user to make any top-level window
smaller, but it will not actually change the size of the
nested server root window. Xnest does not yet sup&acirc;
<br>
port the RANDR extension for resizing, rotation, and
reflection of the root window. If this option is not
specified, Xnest will choose W and H to be 3/4ths the
dimensions <br>
of the root window of the real server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-bw int <br>
This option specifies the border width of the top-level
Xnest window. The integer parameter int must be positive.
The default border width is 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-name string <br>
This option specifies the name of the top-level Xnest window
as string. The default value is the program name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-scrns int <br>
This option specifies the number of screens to create in the
nested server. For each screen, Xnest will create a separate
top-level window. Each screen is referenced by <br>
the number after the dot in the client display name
specification. For example, xterm -display :1.1 will open an
xterm(1) client in the nested server with the display <br>
number :1 on the second screen. The number of screens is
limited by the hard-coded constant in the server sample
code, which is usually 3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-install <br>
This option tells Xnest to do its own color map installation
by bypassing the real window manager. For it to work
properly, the user will probably have to temporarily <br>
quit the real window manager. By default, Xnest will keep
the nested client window whose color map should be installed
in the real server in the WM_COLORMAP_WINDOWS prop&acirc;
<br>
erty of the top-level Xnest window. If this color map is of
the same visual type as the root window of the nested
server, Xnest will associate this color map with the <br>
top-level Xnest window as well. Since this does not have to
be the case, window managers should look primarily at the
WM_COLORMAP_WINDOWS property rather than the color <br>
map associated with the top-level Xnest window.
Unfortunately, window managers are not very good at doing
that yet so this option might come in handy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-parent window_id <br>
This option tells Xnest to use window_id as the root window
instead of creating a window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTENDED DESCRIPTION <br>
Starting up Xnest is just as simple as starting up xclock(1)
from a terminal emulator. If a user wishes to run Xnest on
the same workstation as the real server, it is important
<br>
that the nested server is given its own listening socket
address. Therefore, if there is a server already running on
the user&rsquo;s workstation, Xnest will have to be started
up <br>
with a new display number. Since there is usually no more
than one server running on a workstation, specifying
&acirc;Xnest :1&acirc; on the command line will be
sufficient for most users. <br>
For each server running on the workstation, the display
number needs to be incremented by one. Thus, if you wish to
start another Xnest, you will need to type &acirc;Xnest
:2&acirc; on the <br>
command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To run clients in the nested
server, each client needs to be given the same display
number as the nested server. For example, &acirc;xterm
-display :1&acirc; will start up an xterm process <br>
in the first nested server and &acirc;xterm -display
:2&acirc; will start an xterm in the second nested server
from the example above. Additional clients can be started
from these xterms in <br>
each nested server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Xnest as a client <br>
Xnest behaves and looks to the real server and other real
clients as another real client. It is a rather demanding
client, however, since almost any window or graphics request
<br>
from a nested client will result in a window or graphics
request from Xnest to the real server. Therefore, it is
desirable that Xnest and the real server are on a local
network, <br>
or even better, on the same machine. Xnest assumes that the
real server supports the SHAPE extension. There is no way to
turn off this assumption dynamically. Xnest can be <br>
compiled without the SHAPE extension built in, in which case
the real server need not support it. Dynamic SHAPE extension
selection support may be considered in further
develop&acirc; <br>
ment of Xnest.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since Xnest need not use the
same default visual as the the real server, the top-level
window of the Xnest client always has its own color map.
This implies that other windows&rsquo; <br>
colors will not be displayed properly while the keyboard or
pointer focus is in the Xnest window, unless the real server
has support for more than one installed color map at any
<br>
time. The color map associated with the top window of the
Xnest client need not be the appropriate color map that the
nested server wants installed in the real server. In the
<br>
case that a nested client attempts to install a color map of
a different visual from the default visual of the nested
server, Xnest will put the top window of this nested client
<br>
and all other top windows of the nested clients that use the
same color map into the WM_COLORMAP_WINDOWS property of the
top-level Xnest window on the real server. Thus, it is <br>
important that the real window manager that manages the
Xnest top-level window looks at the WM_COLORMAP_WINDOWS
property rather than the color map associated with the
top-level <br>
Xnest window. Since most window managers don&rsquo;t yet
appear to implement this convention properly, Xnest can
optionally do direct installation of color maps into the
real server <br>
bypassing the real window manager. If the user chooses this
option, it is usually necessary to temporarily disable the
real window manager since it will interfere with the Xnest
<br>
scheme of color map installation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Keyboard and pointer control
procedures of the nested server change the keyboard and
pointer control parameters of the real server. Therefore,
after Xnest is started up, it will <br>
change the keyboard and pointer controls of the real server
to its own internal defaults.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Xnest as a server <br>
Xnest as a server looks exactly like a real server to its
own clients. For the clients, there is no way of telling if
they are running on a real or a nested server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As already mentioned, Xnest is a
very user-friendly server when it comes to customization.
Xnest will pick up a number of command-line arguments that
can configure its default <br>
visual class and depth, number of screens, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The only apparent intricacy from
the users&rsquo; perspective about using Xnest as a server
is the selection of fonts. Xnest manages fonts by loading
them locally and then passing the <br>
font name to the real server and asking it to load that font
remotely. This approach avoids the overload of sending the
glyph bits across the network for every text operation, <br>
although it is really a bug. The consequence of this
approach is that the user will have to worry about two
different font paths &acirc; a local one for the nested
server and a remote <br>
one for the real server &acirc; since Xnest does not
propagate its font path to the real server. The reason for
this is because real and nested servers need not run on the
same file <br>
system which makes the two font paths mutually incompatible.
Thus, if there is a font in the local font path of the
nested server, there is no guarantee that this font exists
in <br>
the remote font path of the real server. The xlsfonts(1)
client, if run on the nested server, will list fonts in the
local font path and, if run on the real server, will list
<br>
fonts in the remote font path. Before a font can be
successfully opened by the nested server, it has to exist in
local and remote font paths. It is the users&rsquo;
responsibility to <br>
make sure that this is the case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FUTURE DIRECTIONS <br>
Make dynamic the requirement for the SHAPE extension in the
real server, rather than having to recompile Xnest to turn
this requirement on and off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perhaps there should be a
command-line option to tell Xnest to inherit the keyboard
and pointer control parameters from the real server rather
than imposing its own.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Xnest should read a
customization input file to provide even greater freedom and
simplicity in selecting the desired layout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is no support for backing
store and save unders, but this should also be
considered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The proper implementation of
fonts should be moved into the os layer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Doesn&rsquo;t run well on servers supporting different
visual depths.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Still crashes randomly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Probably has some memory
leaks.</p>
