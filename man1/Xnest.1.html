Xnest - a nested X server
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<b>Xnest</b> [ <i>options</i> ]
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>Xnest</b> is both an X client and an X server. <b>Xnest</b> is a client of
  the real server which manages windows and graphics requests on its behalf.
  <b>Xnest</b> is a server to its own clients. <b>Xnest</b> manages windows and
  graphics requests on their behalf. To these clients, <b>Xnest</b> appears to
  be a conventional server.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
<b>Xnest</b> supports all standard options of the sample server implementation.
  For more details, please see <b>Xserver</b>(1). The following additional
  arguments are supported as well.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-display </b><i>string</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This option specifies the display name of the real server
      that <b>Xnest</b> should try to connect to. If it is not provided on the
      command line, <b>Xnest</b> will read the <i>DISPLAY</i> environment
      variable in order to find out this information.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-sync</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This option tells <b>Xnest</b> to synchronize its window
      and graphics operations with the real server. This is a useful option for
      debugging, but it will slow down <b>Xnest</b>'s performance considerably.
      It should not be used unless absolutely necessary.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-full</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This option tells <b>Xnest</b> to utilize full regeneration
      of real server objects and reopen a new connection to the real server each
      time the nested server regenerates. The sample server implementation
      regenerates all objects in the server when the last client of this server
      terminates. When this happens, <b>Xnest</b> by default maintains the same
      top-level window and the same real server connection in each new
      generation. If the user selects full regeneration, even the top-level
      window and the connection to the real server will be regenerated for each
      server generation.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-class </b><i>string</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This option specifies the default visual class of the
      nested server. It is similar to the <b>-cc</b> option from the set of
      standard options except that it will accept a string rather than a number
      for the visual class specification. The <i>string</i> must be one of the
      following six values: <b>StaticGray</b>, <b>GrayScale</b>,
      <b>StaticColor</b>, <b>PseudoColor</b>, <b>TrueColor</b>, or
      <b>DirectColor</b>. If both the <b>-class</b> and <b>-cc</b> options are
      specified, the last instance of either option takes precedence. The class
      of the default visual of the nested server need not be the same as the
      class of the default visual of the real server, but it must be supported
      by the real server. Use <b>xdpyinfo</b>(1) to obtain a list of supported
      visual classes on the real server before starting <b>Xnest</b>. If the
      user chooses a static class, all the colors in the default color map will
      be preallocated. If the user chooses a dynamic class, colors in the
      default color map will be available to individual clients for
    allocation.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-depth </b><i>int</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This option specifies the default visual depth of the
      nested server. The depth of the default visual of the nested server need
      not be the same as the depth of the default visual of the real server, but
      it must be supported by the real server. Use <b>xdpyinfo</b>(1) to obtain
      a list of supported visual depths on the real server before starting
      <b>Xnest</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-sss</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This option tells <b>Xnest</b> to use the software screen
      saver. By default, <b>Xnest</b> will use the screen saver that corresponds
      to the hardware screen saver in the real server. Of course, even this
      screen saver is software-generated since <b>Xnest</b> does not control any
      actual hardware. However, it is treated as a hardware screen saver within
      the sample server code.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-geometry
    <i>W</i><b>x</b><i>H</i><b>+</b><i>X</i><b>+</b> <i>Y</i><b></b></b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This option specifies the geometry parameters for the
      top-level <b>Xnest</b> window. See &#x201C;GEOMETRY SPECIFICATIONS&#x201D;
      in <b>X</b>(7) for a discusson of this option's syntax. This window
      corresponds to the root window of the nested server. The width <i>W</i>
      and height <i>H</i> specified with this option will be the maximum width
      and height of each top-level <b>Xnest</b> window. <b>Xnest</b> will allow
      the user to make any top-level window smaller, but it will not actually
      change the size of the nested server root window. <b>Xnest</b> does not
      yet support the RANDR extension for resizing, rotation, and reflection of
      the root window. If this option is not specified, <b>Xnest</b> will choose
      <i>W</i> and <i>H</i> to be 3/4ths the dimensions of the root window of
      the real server.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-bw </b><i>int</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This option specifies the border width of the top-level
      <b>Xnest</b> window. The integer parameter <i>int</i> must be positive.
      The default border width is 1.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-name </b><i>string</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This option specifies the name of the top-level
      <b>Xnest</b> window as <i>string</i>. The default value is the program
      name.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-scrns </b><i>int</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This option specifies the number of screens to create in
      the nested server. For each screen, <b>Xnest</b> will create a separate
      top-level window. Each screen is referenced by the number after the dot in
      the client display name specification. For example, <b>xterm -display
      :1.1</b> will open an <b>xterm</b>(1) client in the nested server with the
      display number <b>:1</b> on the second screen. The number of screens is
      limited by the hard-coded constant in the server sample code, which is
      usually 3.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-install</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This option tells <b>Xnest</b> to do its own color map
      installation by bypassing the real window manager. For it to work
      properly, the user will probably have to temporarily quit the real window
      manager. By default, <b>Xnest</b> will keep the nested client window whose
      color map should be installed in the real server in the
      <i>WM_COLORMAP_WINDOWS</i> property of the top-level <b>Xnest</b> window.
      If this color map is of the same visual type as the root window of the
      nested server, <b>Xnest</b> will associate this color map with the
      top-level <b>Xnest</b> window as well. Since this does not have to be the
      case, window managers should look primarily at the
      <i>WM_COLORMAP_WINDOWS</i> property rather than the color map associated
      with the top-level <b>Xnest</b> window. Unfortunately, window managers are
      not very good at doing that yet so this option might come in handy.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-parent </b><i>window_id</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This option tells <b>Xnest</b> to use <i>window_id</i> as

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="EXTENDED_DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#EXTENDED_DESCRIPTION">EXTENDED
  DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
Starting up <b>Xnest</b> is just as simple as starting up <b>xclock</b>(1) from
  a terminal emulator. If a user wishes to run <b>Xnest</b> on the same
  workstation as the real server, it is important that the nested server is
  given its own listening socket address. Therefore, if there is a server
  already running on the user's workstation, <b>Xnest</b> will have to be
  started up with a new display number. Since there is usually no more than one
  server running on a workstation, specifying &#x2018;<b>Xnest :1</b>&#x2019; on
  the command line will be sufficient for most users. For each server running on
  the workstation, the display number needs to be incremented by one. Thus, if
  you wish to start another <b>Xnest</b>, you will need to type &#x2018;<b>Xnest
  :2</b>&#x2019; on the command line.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To run clients in the nested server, each client needs to be given the same
  display number as the nested server. For example, &#x2018;<b>xterm -display
  :1</b>&#x2019; will start up an <b>xterm</b> process in the first nested
  server and &#x2018;<b>xterm -display :2</b>&#x2019; will start an <b>xterm</b>
  in the second nested server from the example above. Additional clients can be
  started from these <b>xterm</b>s in each nested server.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Xnest_as_a_client"><a class="selflink" href="#Xnest_as_a_client">Xnest
  as a client</a></h2>
<b>Xnest</b> behaves and looks to the real server and other real clients as
  another real client. It is a rather demanding client, however, since almost
  any window or graphics request from a nested client will result in a window or
  graphics request from <b>Xnest</b> to the real server. Therefore, it is
  desirable that <b>Xnest</b> and the real server are on a local network, or
  even better, on the same machine. <b>Xnest</b> assumes that the real server
  supports the SHAPE extension. There is no way to turn off this assumption
  dynamically. <b>Xnest</b> can be compiled without the SHAPE extension built
  in, in which case the real server need not support it. Dynamic SHAPE extension
  selection support may be considered in further development of <b>Xnest</b>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Since <b>Xnest</b> need not use the same default visual as the the real server,
  the top-level window of the <b>Xnest</b> client always has its own color map.
  This implies that other windows' colors will not be displayed properly while
  the keyboard or pointer focus is in the <b>Xnest</b> window, unless the real
  server has support for more than one installed color map at any time. The
  color map associated with the top window of the <b>Xnest</b> client need not
  be the appropriate color map that the nested server wants installed in the
  real server. In the case that a nested client attempts to install a color map
  of a different visual from the default visual of the nested server,
  <b>Xnest</b> will put the top window of this nested client and all other top
  windows of the nested clients that use the same color map into the
  <i>WM_COLORMAP_WINDOWS</i> property of the top-level <b>Xnest</b> window on
  the real server. Thus, it is important that the real window manager that
  manages the <b>Xnest</b> top-level window looks at the
  <i>WM_COLORMAP_WINDOWS</i> property rather than the color map associated with
  the top-level <b>Xnest</b> window. Since most window managers don't yet appear
  to implement this convention properly, <b>Xnest</b> can optionally do direct
  installation of color maps into the real server bypassing the real window
  manager. If the user chooses this option, it is usually necessary to
  temporarily disable the real window manager since it will interfere with the
  <b>Xnest</b> scheme of color map installation.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Keyboard and pointer control procedures of the nested server change the keyboard
  and pointer control parameters of the real server. Therefore, after
  <b>Xnest</b> is started up, it will change the keyboard and pointer controls
  of the real server to its own internal defaults.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Xnest_as_a_server"><a class="selflink" href="#Xnest_as_a_server">Xnest
  as a server</a></h2>
<b>Xnest</b> as a server looks exactly like a real server to its own clients.
  For the clients, there is no way of telling if they are running on a real or a
  nested server.
<div class="Pp"></div>
As already mentioned, <b>Xnest</b> is a very user-friendly server when it comes
  to customization. <b>Xnest</b> will pick up a number of command-line arguments
  that can configure its default visual class and depth, number of screens, etc.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The only apparent intricacy from the users' perspective about using <b>Xnest</b>
  as a server is the selection of fonts. <b>Xnest</b> manages fonts by loading
  them locally and then passing the font name to the real server and asking it
  to load that font remotely. This approach avoids the overload of sending the
  glyph bits across the network for every text operation, although it is really
  a bug. The consequence of this approach is that the user will have to worry
  about two different font paths &#x2014; a local one for the nested server and
  a remote one for the real server &#x2014; since <b>Xnest</b> does not
  propagate its font path to the real server. The reason for this is because
  real and nested servers need not run on the same file system which makes the
  two font paths mutually incompatible. Thus, if there is a font in the local
  font path of the nested server, there is no guarantee that this font exists in
  the remote font path of the real server. The <b>xlsfonts</b>(1) client, if run
  on the nested server, will list fonts in the local font path and, if run on
  the real server, will list fonts in the remote font path. Before a font can be
  successfully opened by the nested server, it has to exist in local and remote
  font paths. It is the users' responsibility to make sure that this is the
  case.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="FUTURE_DIRECTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#FUTURE_DIRECTIONS">FUTURE
  DIRECTIONS</a></h1>
Make dynamic the requirement for the SHAPE extension in the real server, rather
  than having to recompile <b>Xnest</b> to turn this requirement on and off.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Perhaps there should be a command-line option to tell <b>Xnest</b> to inherit
  the keyboard and pointer control parameters from the real server rather than
  imposing its own.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Xnest</b> should read a customization input file to provide even greater
  freedom and simplicity in selecting the desired layout.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There is no support for backing store and save unders, but this should also be
  considered.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The proper implementation of fonts should be moved into the <i>os</i> layer.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="BUGS"><a class="selflink" href="#BUGS">BUGS</a></h1>
Doesn't run well on servers supporting different visual depths.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Still crashes randomly.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Probably has some memory leaks.
