<p>HTPASSWD(1) htpasswd HTPASSWD(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
htpasswd - Manage user files for basic authentication</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
htpasswd [ -c ] [ -i ] [ -m | -B | -d | -s | -p ] [ -C cost
] [ -D ] [ -v ] passwdfile username</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">htpasswd -b [ -c ] [ -m | -B |
-d | -s | -p ] [ -C cost ] [ -D ] [ -v ] passwdfile username
password</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">htpasswd -n [ -i ] [ -m | -B |
-d | -s | -p ] [ -C cost ] username</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">htpasswd -nb [ -m | -B | -d | -s
| -p ] [ -C cost ] username password</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SUMMARY <br>
htpasswd is used to create and update the flat-files used to
store usernames and password for basic authentication of
HTTP users. If htpasswd cannot access a file, such as not
<br>
being able to write to the output file or not being able to
read the file in order to update it, it returns an error
status and makes no changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Resources available from the
Apache HTTP server can be restricted to just the users
listed in the files created by htpasswd. This program can
only manage usernames and passwords <br>
stored in a flat-file. It can encrypt and display password
information for use in other types of data stores, though.
To use a DBM database see dbmmanage or htdbm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">htpasswd encrypts passwords
using either bcrypt, a version of MD5 modified for Apache,
SHA1, or the system&rsquo;s crypt() routine. Files managed
by htpasswd may contain a mixture of <br>
different encoding types of passwords; some user records may
have bcrypt or MD5-encrypted passwords while others in the
same file may have passwords encrypted with crypt().</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This manual page only lists the
command line arguments. For details of the directives
necessary to configure user authentication in httpd see the
Apache manual, which is part of <br>
the Apache distribution or can be found at
http://httpd.apache.org/.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-b Use batch mode; i.e., get the password from the command
line rather than prompting for it. This option should be
used with extreme care, since the password is clearly
vis&acirc; <br>
ible on the command line. For script use see the -i
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i Read the password from stdin
without verification (for script usage).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Create the passwdfile. If
passwdfile already exists, it is rewritten and truncated.
This option cannot be combined with the -n option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Display the results on
standard output rather than updating a file. This is useful
for generating password records acceptable to Apache for
inclusion in non-text data <br>
stores. This option changes the syntax of the command line,
since the passwdfile argument (usually the first one) is
omitted. It cannot be combined with the -c option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m Use MD5 encryption for
passwords. This is the default (since version 2.2.18).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B Use bcrypt encryption for
passwords. This is currently considered to be very
secure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C This flag is only allowed in
combination with -B (bcrypt encryption). It sets the
computing time used for the bcrypt algorithm (higher is more
secure but slower, default: <br>
5, valid: 4 to 31).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Use crypt() encryption for
passwords. This is not supported by the httpd server on
Windows and Netware. This algorithm limits the password
length to 8 characters. This <br>
algorithm is insecure by today&rsquo;s standards. It used to
be the default algorithm until version 2.2.17.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Use SHA encryption for
passwords. Facilitates migration from/to Netscape servers
using the LDAP Directory Interchange Format (ldif). This
algorithm is insecure by today&rsquo;s <br>
standards.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p Use plaintext passwords.
Though htpasswd will support creation on all platforms, the
httpd daemon will only accept plain text passwords on
Windows and Netware.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D Delete user. If the username
exists in the specified htpasswd file, it will be
deleted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Verify password. Verify that
the given password matches the password of the user stored
in the specified htpasswd file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">passwdfile <br>
Name of the file to contain the user name and password. If
-c is given, this file is created if it does not already
exist, or rewritten and truncated if it does exist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">username <br>
The username to create or update in passwdfile. If username
does not exist in this file, an entry is added. If it does
exist, the password is changed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">password <br>
The plaintext password to be encrypted and stored in the
file. Only used with the -b flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
htpasswd returns a zero status (&quot;true&quot;) if the
username and password have been successfully added or
updated in the passwdfile. htpasswd returns 1 if it
encounters some problem <br>
accessing files, 2 if there was a syntax problem with the
command line, 3 if the password was entered interactively
and the verification entry didn&rsquo;t match, 4 if its
operation <br>
was interrupted, 5 if a value is too long (username,
filename, password, or final computed record), 6 if the
username contains illegal characters (see the Restrictions
section), <br>
and 7 if the file is not a valid password file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
htpasswd /usr/local/etc/apache/.htpasswd-users jsmith</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Adds or modifies the password
for user jsmith. The user is prompted for the password. The
password will be encrypted using the modified Apache MD5
algorithm. If the file does not <br>
exist, htpasswd will do nothing except return an error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">htpasswd -c
/home/doe/public_html/.htpasswd jane</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Creates a new file and stores a
record in it for user jane. The user is prompted for the
password. If the file exists and cannot be read, or cannot
be written, it is not altered <br>
and htpasswd will display a message and return an error
status.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">htpasswd -db
/usr/web/.htpasswd-all jones Pwd4Steve</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Encrypts the password from the
command line (Pwd4Steve) using the crypt() algorithm, and
stores it in the specified file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS <br>
Web password files such as those managed by htpasswd should
not be within the Web server&rsquo;s URI space -- that is,
they should not be fetchable with a browser.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This program is not safe as a
setuid executable. Do not make it setuid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The use of the -b option is
discouraged, since when it is used the unencrypted password
appears on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When using the crypt()
algorithm, note that only the first 8 characters of the
password are used to form the password. If the supplied
password is longer, the extra characters <br>
will be silently discarded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The SHA encryption format does
not use salting: for a given password, there is only one
encrypted representation. The crypt() and MD5 formats
permute the representation by <br>
prepending a random salt string, to make dictionary attacks
against the passwords more difficult.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The SHA and crypt() formats are
insecure by today&rsquo;s standards.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RESTRICTIONS <br>
On the Windows platform, passwords encrypted with htpasswd
are limited to no more than 255 characters in length. Longer
passwords will be truncated to 255 characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The MD5 algorithm used by
htpasswd is specific to the Apache software; passwords
encrypted using it will not be usable with other Web
servers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Usernames are limited to 255
bytes and may not include the character :.</p>
