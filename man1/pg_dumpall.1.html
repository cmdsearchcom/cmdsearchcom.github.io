<p>PG_DUMPALL(1) PostgreSQL 9.2.18 Documentation
PG_DUMPALL(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pg_dumpall - extract a PostgreSQL database cluster into a
script file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pg_dumpall [connection-option...] [option...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
pg_dumpall is a utility for writing out
(&acirc;dumping&acirc;) all PostgreSQL databases of a
cluster into one script file. The script file contains SQL
commands that can be used as input to <br>
psql(1) to restore the databases. It does this by calling
pg_dump(1) for each database in a cluster. pg_dumpall also
dumps global objects that are common to all databases. <br>
(pg_dump does not save these objects.) This currently
includes information about database users and groups,
tablespaces, and properties such as access permissions that
apply to <br>
databases as a whole.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since pg_dumpall reads tables
from all databases you will most likely have to connect as a
database superuser in order to produce a complete dump. Also
you will need superuser <br>
privileges to execute the saved script in order to be
allowed to add users and groups, and to create
databases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The SQL script will be written
to the standard output. Use the [-f|file] option or shell
operators to redirect it into a file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pg_dumpall needs to connect
several times to the PostgreSQL server (once per database).
If you use password authentication it will ask for a
password each time. It is convenient <br>
to have a ~/.pgpass file in such cases. See Section 31.15,
&acirc;The Password File&acirc;, in the documentation for
more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The following command-line options control the content and
format of the output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a, --data-only <br>
Dump only the data, not the schema (data definitions).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --clean <br>
Include SQL commands to clean (drop) databases before
recreating them. DROP commands for roles and tablespaces are
added as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f filename, --file=filename
<br>
Send output to the specified file. If this is omitted, the
standard output is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g, --globals-only <br>
Dump only global objects (roles and tablespaces), no
databases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i, --ignore-version <br>
A deprecated option that is now ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o, --oids <br>
Dump object identifiers (OIDs) as part of the data for every
table. Use this option if your application references the
OID columns in some way (e.g., in a foreign key <br>
constraint). Otherwise, this option should not be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O, --no-owner <br>
Do not output commands to set ownership of objects to match
the original database. By default, pg_dumpall issues ALTER
OWNER or SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION statements to set <br>
ownership of created schema elements. These statements will
fail when the script is run unless it is started by a
superuser (or the same user that owns all of the objects in
<br>
the script). To make a script that can be restored by any
user, but will give that user ownership of all the objects,
specify -O.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, --roles-only <br>
Dump only roles, no databases or tablespaces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --schema-only <br>
Dump only the object definitions (schema), not data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S username,
--superuser=username <br>
Specify the superuser user name to use when disabling
triggers. This is only relevant if --disable-triggers is
used. (Usually, it&rsquo;s better to leave this out, and
instead <br>
start the resulting script as superuser.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t, --tablespaces-only <br>
Dump only tablespaces, no databases or roles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
Specifies verbose mode. This will cause pg_dumpall to output
start/stop times to the dump file, and progress messages to
standard error. It will also enable verbose output in <br>
pg_dump.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
Print the pg_dumpall version and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x, --no-privileges, --no-acl
<br>
Prevent dumping of access privileges (grant/revoke
commands).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--binary-upgrade <br>
This option is for use by in-place upgrade utilities. Its
use for other purposes is not recommended or supported. The
behavior of the option may change in future releases <br>
without notice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--column-inserts,
--attribute-inserts <br>
Dump data as INSERT commands with explicit column names
(INSERT INTO table (column, ...) VALUES ...). This will make
restoration very slow; it is mainly useful for making <br>
dumps that can be loaded into non-PostgreSQL databases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--disable-dollar-quoting <br>
This option disables the use of dollar quoting for function
bodies, and forces them to be quoted using SQL standard
string syntax.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--disable-triggers <br>
This option is only relevant when creating a data-only dump.
It instructs pg_dumpall to include commands to temporarily
disable triggers on the target tables while the data <br>
is reloaded. Use this if you have referential integrity
checks or other triggers on the tables that you do not want
to invoke during data reload.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Presently, the commands emitted
for --disable-triggers must be done as superuser. So, you
should also specify a superuser name with -S, or preferably
be careful to start the <br>
resulting script as a superuser.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--inserts <br>
Dump data as INSERT commands (rather than COPY). This will
make restoration very slow; it is mainly useful for making
dumps that can be loaded into non-PostgreSQL databases. <br>
Note that the restore might fail altogether if you have
rearranged column order. The --column-inserts option is
safer, though even slower.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--lock-wait-timeout=timeout <br>
Do not wait forever to acquire shared table locks at the
beginning of the dump. Instead, fail if unable to lock a
table within the specified timeout. The timeout may be <br>
specified in any of the formats accepted by SET
statement_timeout. Allowed values vary depending on the
server version you are dumping from, but an integer number
of <br>
milliseconds is accepted by all versions since 7.3. This
option is ignored when dumping from a pre-7.3 server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-security-labels <br>
Do not dump security labels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-tablespaces <br>
Do not output commands to create tablespaces nor select
tablespaces for objects. With this option, all objects will
be created in whichever tablespace is the default during
<br>
restore.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-unlogged-table-data <br>
Do not dump the contents of unlogged tables. This option has
no effect on whether or not the table definitions (schema)
are dumped; it only suppresses dumping the table data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--quote-all-identifiers <br>
Force quoting of all identifiers. This option is recommended
when dumping a database from a server whose PostgreSQL major
version is different from pg_dumpall&rsquo;s, or when the
<br>
output is intended to be loaded into a server of a different
major version. By default, pg_dumpall quotes only
identifiers that are reserved words in its own major
version. <br>
This sometimes results in compatibility issues when dealing
with servers of other versions that may have slightly
different sets of reserved words. Using <br>
--quote-all-identifiers prevents such issues, at the price
of a harder-to-read dump script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--use-set-session-authorization
<br>
Output SQL-standard SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION commands
instead of ALTER OWNER commands to determine object
ownership. This makes the dump more standards compatible,
but <br>
depending on the history of the objects in the dump, might
not restore properly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-?, --help <br>
Show help about pg_dumpall command line arguments, and
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following command-line
options control the database connection parameters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h host, --host=host <br>
Specifies the host name of the machine on which the database
server is running. If the value begins with a slash, it is
used as the directory for the Unix domain socket. The <br>
default is taken from the PGHOST environment variable, if
set, else a Unix domain socket connection is attempted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l dbname, --database=dbname
<br>
Specifies the name of the database to connect to to dump
global objects and discover what other databases should be
dumped. If not specified, the postgres database will be <br>
used, and if that does not exist, template1 will be
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p port, --port=port <br>
Specifies the TCP port or local Unix domain socket file
extension on which the server is listening for connections.
Defaults to the PGPORT environment variable, if set, or a
<br>
compiled-in default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U username, --username=username
<br>
User name to connect as.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w, --no-password <br>
Never issue a password prompt. If the server requires
password authentication and a password is not available by
other means such as a .pgpass file, the connection attempt
<br>
will fail. This option can be useful in batch jobs and
scripts where no user is present to enter a password.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-W, --password <br>
Force pg_dumpall to prompt for a password before connecting
to a database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is never essential,
since pg_dumpall will automatically prompt for a password if
the server demands password authentication. However,
pg_dumpall will waste a <br>
connection attempt finding out that the server wants a
password. In some cases it is worth typing -W to avoid the
extra connection attempt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the password prompt
will occur again for each database to be dumped. Usually,
it&rsquo;s better to set up a ~/.pgpass file than to rely on
manual password entry.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--role=rolename <br>
Specifies a role name to be used to create the dump. This
option causes pg_dumpall to issue a SET ROLErolename command
after connecting to the database. It is useful when the <br>
authenticated user (specified by -U) lacks privileges needed
by pg_dumpall, but can switch to a role with the required
rights. Some installations have a policy against <br>
logging in directly as a superuser, and use of this option
allows dumps to be made without violating the policy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
PGHOST, PGOPTIONS, PGPORT, PGUSER <br>
Default connection parameters</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This utility, like most other
PostgreSQL utilities, also uses the environment variables
supported by libpq (see Section 31.14, &acirc;Environment
Variables&acirc;, in the documentation).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
Since pg_dumpall calls pg_dump internally, some diagnostic
messages will refer to pg_dump.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once restored, it is wise to run
ANALYZE on each database so the optimizer has useful
statistics. You can also run vacuumdb -a -z to analyze all
databases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pg_dumpall requires all needed
tablespace directories to exist before the restore;
otherwise, database creation will fail for databases in
non-default locations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
To dump all databases:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ pg_dumpall &gt; db.out</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To reload database(s) from this
file, you can use:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ psql -f db.out postgres</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(It is not important to which
database you connect here since the script file created by
pg_dumpall will contain the appropriate commands to create
and connect to the saved <br>
databases.)</p>

conditions.</p>
