external DVD player and make sure they match up.</p>

black-and-white movie to avoid chrominance artifacts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TOGGLE_COLOR_INVERT /

company Optus who want to avoid using the decryption boxes
and <br>
tune using their capture card directly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TOGGLE_DEINTERLACER <br>
This toggles between the available deinterlacing
methods.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TOGGLE_FULLSCREEN <br>

and bottom of the input picture to help fit the window to
the image content.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TOGGLE_MIRROR <br>

This is useful for using tvtime with mirroring projectors,
although I don&rsquo;t think it will actually work as <br>
intended yet since we don&rsquo;t mirror the OSD output. :)
Comments appreciated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TOGGLE_MUTE <br>
Toggles the mute state in the capture card (and not in your
soundcard).</p>

channels between the PAL-BG and PAL-DK audio norms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TOGGLE_PAL_SECAM <br>
Toggles between PAL and SECAM on the current channel. This
feature is useful for regions which receive both PAL and
SECAM channels, such that tvtime can be configured on <br>
a per-channel basis for the correct norm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TOGGLE_PAUSE <br>

single set of frames with various deinterlacers.</p>

for NTSC input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TOGGLE_QUIET_SCREENSHOTS <br>

themselves on the OSD. This is useful if you intend to take
a lot of screenshots, and don&rsquo;t want the text to <br>
interrupt your TV watching or appear in other
screenshots.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TOGGLE_SIGNAL_DETECTION <br>
Toggles on and off tvtime&rsquo;s signal detection code.
Signal detection enables features like channel scanning and
increases responsiveness on channels with poor reception,
<br>
but may make it impossible to watch stations where the
reception is too bad for the card to detect it reliably.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TOGGLE_XDS <br>
Toggles on and off tvtime&rsquo;s XDS decoding code. XDS is
used to send information about the channel including the
network name and call letters, and sometimes information

about the current show. This information is then shown on
the OSD and saved to the stationlist.xml file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TOGGLE_XMLTV_LANGUAGE <br>
Toggles which language to show by default from the XMLTV
file from the ones available in the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UP This command provides the
dual functionality of channel up or menu arrow up, depending
on whether the menu is currently active. This command is to
be used together with <br>
the LEFT, RIGHT and DOWN commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">QUIT Asks the running tvtime
process to exit.</p>
