<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
mgp is an X11 based presentation tool. It is designed to
make simple presentations easy while to make complicated
presentations possible. Its presentation file (whose suffix
is <br>
typically .mgp) is just text so that you can create
presentation files quickly with your favorite editor (such
as Emacs).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The .mgp file consists of text
and control commands (such as pagebreak, centering, and/or
inline image). Control commands are specified on the
beginning of lines started with one <br>
% sign. You can include numerous kinds of image format files
onto the presentation file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mgp uses Japanese/English fonts
in various sizes. mgp uses X11 scalable fonts provided by
X11 servers. mgp can also utilize the Japanese outline font
library, &quot;VFlib&quot;, if config&acirc; <br>
ured to do so at compilation time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options are
available:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b bgcolor <br>
Set background color to bgcolor. (The default value is
black)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c vfcap <br>
Specify a VFlib configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d [interval] <br>
Demonstration mode. Browse all page automatically, spending
interval secounds on each page and terminate. If interval is
not specified, it will be set to 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f vfont <br>
Specify the font name to be used by VFlib. (The default
value is minsl)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g geometry <br>
Set the size and location of the window. Please note that -g
implies -o. mgp will not override the window manager if you
specify the geometry.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Display the usage and exit
without performing a presentation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l There are two kind of fonts
available by VFlib; They are outline font and bitmap font.
By specifying -l, you can disable the use of outline
fonts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n mgp accepts any key inputs
from invoked terminal as KEY OPERATION described below. -n
disables this feature. (This option may be removed in the
future release)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o Do not override window
manager. (By default, mgp overrides window manager and
occupies the whole display)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p page <br>
Start presentation from page, rather than the first
page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Do not beep on errors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t timeslot <br>
Specify the timeslot assigned to the presentation in minute.
The timer is invoked when the second page is displayed and
the remaining presentation time is indicated by the <br>
length of bar shown at the bottom of the display. The
timebar is updated when some X11 event is raised, for
instance some keypress. Timebar will be green if you have
more <br>
than 50% of the timeslot, yellow while you have more than
30% of the timeslot, and red for the other cases. When the
assigned timeslot is expired, exceeding time is also <br>
shown as a timebar growing from left to right. Current page
is indicated by the position of a small vertical bar; the
vertical bar is drawn at the leftend when the first <br>
page is displayed while the bar is drawn at the rightend
when the last page is displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--title name <br>
Set the title of the window to name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Display the MagicPoint
version and exit without performing a presentation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w wdir <br>
specifies the working directory used for store embedded
images if any. To generate an embedded MGP file, use
mgpembed(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x engine <br>
Do not use rendering engine, specified by engine. engine can
be VFlib or FreeType.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B Omit background image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C Use private colormap.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D htmldir <br>
Generate html pages of the presentation into htmldir. You
will need xwintoppm(1) (included in mgp kit), and
pnmscale(1), cjpeg(1), and djpeg(1) (included in netpbm and
<br>
Independent Jpeg Group jpeg package).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E htmlimage <br>
Specifies html image type. Now &quot;jpg&quot; and
&quot;png&quot; are supported. default value is
&quot;jpg&quot;. It works when -D option is set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F mode,effect,value <br>
Specifies forward page cache options. Mode, effect and value
are numbers. Mode specifies caching mode. Mode 0 means
caching is executed after 2 seconds idle. Mode 1 <br>
means caching is executed immediately. Effect specifies
&rsquo;special effect&rsquo; for the forward page cache.
Currently, two special effects are supported. Effect 1 means
that the <br>
next page will come in from the left side. Effect 2 means
that the current page will go out to the left side. Effect 0
means no special effect. Value specifies speed of <br>
special effect. Value 1 means the highest speed. A higher
value for value decreases effect speed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-G Specifies to turn on page
guide function. At the bottom of the screen, the titles of
next page and previous page are displayed to assist the
presentation. Page guide can <br>
be turned on and off by keyboard too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O Obey to the window manager,
but with less decoration around the window. The behavior of
this option is affected by how the window manager is
implemented; this option may <br>
have no effect on some of the window managers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Q quality <br>
Set background image quality(0-100).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R mgp will usually reload the
presentation file if it gets updated, based on the file
modification time taken by stat(2). -R disables this
auto-reloading feature.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S Be secure. Skip directives
that fork/exec the child process. It is suggested to use
this option if you got some presentation file from others.
This is enabled by <br>
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U Be unsecure. Enable
directives that fork/exec the child process. Allow to use
non-ASCII filename.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T timestampfile <br>
If the option is specified, mgp will modify the content of
timestampfile every time it updates the presentation window.
This option is useful for external process to <br>
understand when mgp modifies the window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Be verbose. Generate
debugging output to standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X gsdevice <br>
mgp sometimes invokes ghostscript(1) to render postscript
images. -X enables you to specify the device to be used by
ghostscript(1). If you specify gsdevice with a trail&acirc;
<br>
ing &rsquo;+&rsquo;, pnmscale(1) and pnmdepth(1) will be
invoked for anti-aliasing. The default gsdevice is
&quot;pnmraw+&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KEY OPERATION <br>
The keyboard/mouse commands are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mouse button 1 (leftmost button)
<br>
Go forward a page. Space key, downward cursor key, scroll
down key, &quot;f&quot; key, &quot;j&quot; key, and
&quot;n&quot; key have the same effect. If &lt;number&gt; is
specified, go forward &lt;number&gt; <br>
pages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mouse button 3 (rightmost
button) <br>
Go to the previous page. &quot;b&quot; key, &quot;k&quot;
key, &quot;p&quot; key, backspace key, scroll up key and
upward cursor key have the same effect. If &lt;number&gt; is
specified, go back &lt;number&gt; <br>
pages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 - 9 (number buttons) <br>
Set prefix number in decimal. i.e. &lt;number&gt; =
&lt;number&gt; * 10 + &lt;keyN&gt; - &lt;key0&gt;. For
example, by typing in &quot;10g&quot; you can jump to page
10.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">g Go to the &lt;number&gt; page.
If number of 0 is specified, go to the last page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">control key <br>
Display the page listing menu. See below for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">G Enable/disable page guide. See
description for option -G for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">x Enable/disable rakugaki
(jotting) mode. You can make an annotation (by mouse) on the
presentation. Mouse button 2 (middle) has the same
effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">X Change the pen color for
rakugaki (jotting) mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">t Enable/disable the timebar if
-t timeslot option is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c Enable/disable forward page
cache.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">w Toggle full screen mode with
EWMH. (You need a EWMH-aware window manager and need to run
mgp with -o or -g option)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">control-L <br>
Repaint the current page. Use this if you messed up the page
by jotting too much.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">control-R <br>
Reload the current presentation file. If the current page
becomes unavailable, page pointer will be moved back to
1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">escape key <br>
Quit the currently running mgp. &quot;q&quot; key also has
the same effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">During the presentation, you can
see the page list at the bottom of the window when you press
a Control Key. Choosing a page with the mouse and clicking
it with the leftmost mouse <br>
button, you can go to corresponding page directly. Releasing
the Control Key, the page list disappears and you can
continue with the current page. This function is useful
during <br>
the Q-and-A period after your presentation completes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION FILES <br>
mgp will look at a file named ~/.mgprc in your home
directory. The path to this file can be overriden with the
environment variable MGPRC. The content of the file must be
a lim&acirc; <br>
ited set of magicpoint directives, one directive per line,
without % sign. Lines start with #, or empty lines, will be
silently ignored. See SYNTAX for eligible directives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mgp imports various image draw
functions from xloadimage(1). This means that the location
of image files can be specified by ~/.xloadimagerc file. If
you specify the presentation <br>
file with its directory, that directory is searched first
and then the path specified in the ~/.xloadimagerc is
searched.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
MGPRC Full path of the configuration file. When unset,
~/.mgprc is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SECURITY ISSUES <br>
The presentation file can include directives to call the
external process, just like shell process. Therefore, the
presentation file should be treated just like shell script
or <br>
perl script. This is STRONGLY recommended to review the
content of the presentation file before invoking mgp, if you
got the file from others. By adding the -S option to the
com&acirc; <br>
mand line argument, directives that call external processes
will be skipped.</p>
