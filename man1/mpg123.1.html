<p>mpg123(1) General Commands Manual mpg123(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
mpg123 - play audio MPEG 1.0/2.0/2.5 stream (layers 1, 2 and
3)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
mpg123 [ options ] file-or-URL...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
mpg123 reads one or more files (or standard input if
&lsquo;&lsquo;-&rsquo;&rsquo; is specified) or URLs and
plays them on the audio device (default) or outputs them to
stdout. file/URL is assumed to <br>
be an MPEG audio bit stream.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERANDS <br>
The following operands are supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file(s) The path name(s) of one
or more input files. They must be valid MPEG-1.0/2.0/2.5
audio layer 1, 2 or 3 bit streams. If a dash
&lsquo;&lsquo;-&rsquo;&rsquo; is specified, MPEG data will
be read <br>
from the standard input. Furthermore, any name starting with
&lsquo;&lsquo;http://&rsquo;&rsquo; is recognized as URL
(see next section).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
mpg123 options may be either the traditional POSIX one
letter options, or the GNU style long options. POSIX style
options start with a single &lsquo;&lsquo;-&rsquo;&rsquo;,
while GNU long options start <br>
with &lsquo;&lsquo;--&rsquo;&rsquo;. Option arguments (if
needed) follow separated by whitespace (not
&lsquo;&lsquo;=&rsquo;&rsquo;). Note that some options can
be absent from your installation when disabled in the build
<br>
process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUT OPTIONS <br>
-k num, --skip num <br>
Skip first num frames. By default the decoding starts at the
first frame.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n num, --frames num <br>
Decode only num frames. By default the complete stream is
decoded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--fuzzy <br>
Enable fuzzy seeks (guessing byte offsets or using
approximate seek points from Xing TOC). Without that, seeks
need a first scan through the file before they can jump at
<br>
positions. You can decide here: sample-accurate operation
with gapless features or faster (fuzzy) seeking.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-y, --no-resync <br>
Do NOT try to resync and continue decoding if an error
occurs in the input file. Normally, mpg123 tries to keep the
playback alive at all costs, including skipping invalid <br>
material and searching new header when something goes wrong.
With this switch you can make it bail out on data errors
(and perhaps spare your ears a bad time). Note that <br>
this switch has been renamed from --resync. The old name
still works, but is not advertised or recommened to use
(subject to removal in future).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--resync-limit bytes <br>
Set number of bytes to search for valid MPEG data once lost
in stream; &lt;0 means search whole stream. If you know
there are huge chunks of invalid data in your files... <br>
here is your hammer. Note: Only since version 1.14 this also
increases the amount of junk skipped on beginning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p URL | none, --proxy URL |
none <br>
The specified proxy will be used for HTTP requests. It
should be specified as full URL
(&lsquo;&lsquo;http://host.domain:port/&rsquo;&rsquo;), but
the &lsquo;&lsquo;http://&rsquo;&rsquo; prefix, the port
number and the <br>
trailing slash are optional (the default port is 80).
Specifying none means not to use any proxy, and to retrieve
files directly from the respective servers. See also <br>
the &lsquo;&lsquo;HTTP SUPPORT&rsquo;&rsquo; section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u auth, --auth auth <br>
HTTP authentication to use when recieving files via HTTP.
The format used is user:password.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ignore-mime <br>
Ignore MIME types given by HTTP server. If you know better
and want mpg123 to decode something the server thinks is
image/png, then just do it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-seekbuffer <br>
Disable the default micro-buffering of non-seekable streams
that gives the parser a safer footing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-@ file, --list file <br>
Read filenames and/or URLs of MPEG audio streams from the
specified file in addition to the ones specified on the
command line (if any). Note that file can be either an <br>
ordinary file, a dash &lsquo;&lsquo;-&rsquo;&rsquo; to
indicate that a list of filenames/URLs is to be read from
the standard input, or an URL pointing to a an appropriate
list file. Note: only <br>
one -@ option can be used (if more than one is specified,
only the last one will be recognized).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l n, --listentry n <br>
Of the playlist, play specified entry only. n is the number
of entry starting at 1. A value of 0 is the default and
means playling the whole list, a negative value means <br>
showing of the list of titles with their numbers...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--continue <br>
Enable playlist continuation mode. This changes frame
skipping to apply only to the first track and also continues
to play following tracks in playlist after the selected <br>
one. Also, the option to play a number of frames only
applies to the whole playlist. Basically, this tries to
treat the playlist more like one big stream (like, an audio
<br>
book). The current track number in list (1-based) and frame
number (0-based) are printed at exit (useful if you
interrupted playback and want to continue later). Note <br>
that the continuation info is printed to standard output
unless the switch for piping audio data to standard out is
used. Also, it really makes sense to work with actual <br>
playlist files instead of lists of file names as arguments,
to keep track positions consistent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--loop times <br>
for looping track(s) a certain number of times, &lt; 0 means
infinite loop (not with --random!).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--keep-open <br>
For remote control mode: Keep loaded file open after
reaching end.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--timeout seconds <br>
Timeout in (integer) seconds before declaring a stream dead
(if &lt;= 0, wait forever).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z, --shuffle <br>
Shuffle play. Randomly shuffles the order of files specified
on the command line, or in the list file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Z, --random <br>
Continuous random play. Keeps picking a random file from the
command line or the play list. Unlike shuffle play above,
random play never ends, and plays individual songs <br>
more than once.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-icy-meta <br>
Do not accept ICY meta data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i, --index <br>
Index / scan through the track before playback. This fills
the index table for seeking (if enabled in libmpg123) and
may make the operating system cache the file contents <br>
for smoother operating on playback.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--index-size size <br>
Set the number of entries in the seek frame index table.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--preframes num <br>
Set the number of frames to be read as lead-in before a
seeked-to position. This serves to fill the layer 3 bit
reservoir, which is needed to faithfully reproduce a
cer&acirc; <br>
tain sample at a certain position. Note that for layer 3, a
minimum of 1 is enforced (because of frame overlap), and for
layer 1 and 2, this is limited to 2 (no bit <br>
reservoir in that case, but engine spin-up anyway).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT and PROCESSING OPTIONS
<br>
-o module, --output module <br>
Select audio output module. You can provide a
comma-separated list to use the first one that works.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--list-modules <br>
List the available modules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a dev, --audiodevice dev <br>
Specify the audio device to use. The default is
system-dependent (usually /dev/audio or /dev/dsp). Use this
option if you have multiple audio devices and the default is
<br>
not what you want.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --stdout <br>
The decoded audio samples are written to standard output,
instead of playing them through the audio device. This
option must be used if your audio hardware is not sup&acirc;
<br>
ported by mpg123. The output format per default is raw
(headerless) linear PCM audio data, 16 bit, stereo, host
byte order (you can force mono or 8bit).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O file, --outfile <br>
Write raw output into a file (instead of simply redirecting
standard output to a file with the shell).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w file, --wav <br>
Write output as WAV file. This will cause the MPEG stream to
be decoded and saved as file file , or standard output if -
is used as file name. You can also use --au and <br>
--cdr for AU and CDR format, respectively. Note that WAV/AU
writing to non-seekable files, or redirected stdout, needs
some thought. Since 1.16.0, the logic changed to <br>
writing the header with the first actual data. This avoids
spurious WAV headers in a pipe, for example. The result of
decoding nothing to WAV/AU is a file consisting just <br>
of the header when it is seekable and really nothing when
not (not even a header). Correctly writing data with
prophetic headers to stdout is no easy business.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--au file <br>
Does not play the MPEG file but writes it to file in SUN
audio format. If - is used as the filename, the AU file is
written to stdout. See paragraph about WAV writing for <br>
header fun with non-seekable streams.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--cdr file <br>
Does not play the MPEG file but writes it to file as a CDR
file. If - is used as the filename, the CDR file is written
to stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--reopen <br>
Forces reopen of the audiodevice after ever song</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--cpu decoder-type <br>
Selects a certain decoder (optimized for specific CPU), for
example i586 or MMX. The list of available decoders can
vary; depending on the build and what your CPU sup&acirc;
<br>
ports. This options is only availabe when the build actually
includes several optimized decoders.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--test-cpu <br>
Tests your CPU and prints a list of possible choices for
--cpu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--list-cpu <br>
Lists all available decoder choices, regardless of support
by your CPU.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g gain, --gain gain <br>
[DEPRECATED] Set audio hardware output gain (default:
don&rsquo;t change). The unit of the gain value is hardware
and output module dependent. (This parameter is only
provided <br>
for backwards compatibility and may be removed in the future
without prior notice. Use the audio player for playing and a
mixer app for mixing, UNIX style!)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f factor, --scale factor <br>
Change scale factor (default: 32768).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--rva-mix, --rva-radio <br>
Enable RVA (relative volume adjustment) using the values
stored for ReplayGain radio mode / mix mode with all tracks
roughly equal loudness. The first valid information <br>
found in ID3V2 Tags (Comment named RVA or the RVA2 frame) or
ReplayGain header in Lame/Info Tag is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--rva-album, --rva-audiophile
<br>
Enable RVA (relative volume adjustment) using the values
stored for ReplayGain audiophile mode / album mode with
usually the effect of adjusting album loudness but keeping
<br>
relative loudness inside album. The first valid information
found in ID3V2 Tags (Comment named RVA_ALBUM or the RVA2
frame) or ReplayGain header in Lame/Info Tag is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-0, --single0; -1, --single1
<br>
Decode only channel 0 (left) or channel 1 (right),
respectively. These options are available for stereo MPEG
streams only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m, --mono, --mix, --singlemix
<br>
Mix both channels / decode mono. It takes less CPU time than
full stereo decoding.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--stereo <br>
Force stereo output</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r rate, --rate rate <br>
Set sample rate (default: automatic). You may want to change
this if you need a constant bitrate independent of the mpeg
stream rate. mpg123 automagically converts the <br>
rate. You should then combine this with --stereo or
--mono.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-2, --2to1; -4, --4to1 <br>
Performs a downsampling of ratio 2:1 (22 kHz) or 4:1 (11
kHz) on the output stream, respectively. Saves some CPU
cycles, but at least the 4:1 ratio sounds ugly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--pitch value <br>
Set hardware pitch (speedup/down, 0 is neutral; 0.05 is 5%).
This changes the output sampling rate, so it only works in
the range your audio system/hardware supports.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--8bit Forces 8bit output</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--float <br>
Forces f32 encoding</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e enc, --encoding enc <br>
Choose output sample encoding. Possible values look like f32
(32-bit floating point), s32 (32-bit signed integer), u32
(32-bit unsigned integer) and the variants with dif&acirc;
<br>
ferent numbers of bits (s24, u24, s16, u16, s8, u8) and also
special variants like ulaw and alaw 8-bit. See the output of
mpg123&rsquo;s longhelp for actually available encod&acirc;
<br>
ings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d n, --doublespeed n <br>
Only play every n&rsquo;th frame. This will cause the MPEG
stream to be played n times faster, which can be used for
special effects. Can also be combined with the --halfspeed
<br>
option to play 3 out of 4 frames etc. Don&rsquo;t expect
great sound quality when using this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h n, --halfspeed n <br>
Play each frame n times. This will cause the MPEG stream to
be played at 1/n&rsquo;th speed (n times slower), which can
be used for special effects. Can also be combined with <br>
the --doublespeed option to double every third frame or
things like that. Don&rsquo;t expect great sound quality
when using this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E file, --equalizer <br>
Enables equalization, taken from file. The file needs to
contain 32 lines of data, additional comment lines may be
prefixed with #. Each data line consists of two float&acirc;
<br>
ing-point entries, separated by whitespace. They specify the
multipliers for left and right channel of a certain
frequency band, respectively. The first line corresponds
<br>
to the lowest, the 32nd to the highest frequency band. Note
that you can control the equalizer interactively with the
generic control interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--gapless <br>
Enable code that cuts (junk) samples at beginning and end of
tracks, enabling gapless transitions between MPEG files when
encoder padding and codec delays would prevent <br>
it. This is enabled per default beginning with mpg123
version 1.0.0 .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-gapless <br>
Disable the gapless code. That gives you MP3 decodings that
include encoder delay and padding plus mpg123&rsquo;s
decoder delay.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-infoframe <br>
Do not parse the Xing/Lame/VBR/Info frame, decode it instead
just like a stupid old MP3 hardware player. This implies
disabling of gapless playback as the necessary <br>
information is in said metadata frame.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D n, --delay n <br>
Insert a delay of n seconds before each track.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o h, --headphones <br>
Direct audio output to the headphone connector (some
hardware only; AIX, HP, SUN).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o s, --speaker <br>
Direct audio output to the speaker (some hardware only; AIX,
HP, SUN).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o l, --lineout <br>
Direct audio output to the line-out connector (some hardware
only; AIX, HP, SUN).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b size, --buffer size <br>
Use an audio output buffer of size Kbytes. This is useful to
bypass short periods of heavy system activity, which would
normally cause the audio output to be interrupted. <br>
You should specify a buffer size of at least 1024 (i.e. 1
Mb, which equals about 6 seconds of audio data) or more;
less than about 300 does not make much sense. The <br>
default is 0, which turns buffering off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--preload fraction <br>
Wait for the buffer to be filled to fraction before starting
playback (fraction between 0 and 1). You can tune this
prebuffering to either get faster sound to your ears or <br>
safer uninterrupted web radio. Default is 0.2 (wait for 20 %
of buffer to be full, changed from 1 in version 1.23).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--devbuffer seconds <br>
Set device buffer in seconds; &lt;= 0 means default value.
This is the small buffer between the application and the
audio backend, possibly directly related to hardware
buf&acirc; <br>
fers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--smooth <br>
Keep buffer over track boundaries -- meaning, do not empty
the buffer between tracks for possibly some added
smoothness.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MISC OPTIONS <br>
-t, --test <br>
Test mode. The audio stream is decoded, but no output
occurs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --check <br>
Check for filter range violations (clipping), and report
them for each frame if any occur.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
Increase the verbosity level. For example, displays the
frame numbers during decoding.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q, --quiet <br>
Quiet. Suppress diagnostic messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C, --control <br>
Enable terminal control keys. This is enabled automatically
if a terminal is detected. By default use &rsquo;s&rsquo; or
the space bar to stop/restart (pause, unpause) playback,
&rsquo;f&rsquo; <br>
to jump forward to the next song, &rsquo;b&rsquo; to jump
back to the beginning of the song, &rsquo;,&rsquo; to
rewind, &rsquo;.&rsquo; to fast forward, and &rsquo;q&rsquo;
to quit. Type &rsquo;h&rsquo; for a full list of
avail&acirc; <br>
able controls.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-control <br>
Disable terminal control even if terminal is detected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--title <br>
In an xterm, rxvt, screen, iris-ansi (compatible, TERM
environment variable is examined), change the window&rsquo;s
title to the name of song currently playing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--name name <br>
Set the name of this instance, possibly used in various
places. This sets the client name for JACK output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--long-tag <br>
Display ID3 tag info always in long format with one line per
item (artist, title, ...)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--utf8 Regardless of
environment, print metadata in UTF-8 (otherwise, when not
using UTF-8 locale, you&rsquo;ll get ASCII stripdown).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R, --remote <br>
Activate generic control interface. mpg123 will then read
and execute commands from stdin. Basic usage is
&lsquo;&lsquo;load &lt;filename&gt; &rsquo;&rsquo; to play
some file and the obvious <br>
&lsquo;&lsquo;pause&rsquo;&rsquo;, &lsquo;&lsquo;command.
&lsquo;&lsquo;jump &lt;frame&gt;&rsquo;&rsquo; will
jump/seek to a given point (MPEG frame number). Issue
&lsquo;&lsquo;help&rsquo;&rsquo; to get a full list of
commands and syntax.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--remote-err <br>
Print responses for generic control mode to standard error,
not standard out. This is automatically triggered when using
-s N.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--fifo path <br>
Create a fifo / named pipe on the given path and use that
for reading commands instead of standard input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--aggressive <br>
Tries to get higher priority</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T, --realtime <br>
Tries to gain realtime priority. This option usually
requires root privileges to have any effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-?, --help <br>
Shows short usage instructions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--longhelp <br>
Shows long usage instructions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Print the version string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HTTP SUPPORT <br>
In addition to reading MPEG audio streams from ordinary
files and from the standard input, mpg123 supports retrieval
of MPEG audio files or playlists via the HTTP protocol,
which <br>
is used in the World Wide Web (WWW). Such files are
specified using a so-called URL, which starts with
&lsquo;&lsquo;http://&rsquo;&rsquo;. When a file with that
prefix is encountered, mpg123 attempts <br>
to open an HTTP connection to the server in order to
retrieve that file to decode and play it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is often useful to retrieve
files through a WWW cache or so-called proxy. To accomplish
this, mpg123 examines the environment for variables named
MP3_HTTP_PROXY, http_proxy <br>
and HTTP_PROXY, in this order. The value of the first one
that is set will be used as proxy specification. To override
this, you can use the -p command line option (see the <br>
&lsquo;&lsquo;OPTIONS&rsquo;&rsquo; section). Specifying -p
none will enforce contacting the server directly without
using any proxy, even if one of the above environment
variables is set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that, in order to play MPEG
audio files from a WWW server, it is necessary that the
connection to that server is fast enough. For example, a 128
kbit/s MPEG file requires <br>
the network connection to be at least 128 kbit/s (16
kbyte/s) plus protocol overhead. If you suffer from short
network outages, you should try the -b option (buffer) to
bypass <br>
such outages. If your network connection is generally not
fast enough to retrieve MPEG audio files in realtime, you
can first download the files to your local harddisk (e.g.
<br>
using wget(1)) and then play them from there.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If authentication is needed to
access the file it can be specified with the -u
user:pass.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INTERRUPT <br>
When in terminal control mode, you can quit via pressing the
q key, while any time you can abort mpg123 by pressing
Ctrl-C. If not in terminal control mode, this will skip to
the <br>
next file (if any). If you want to abort playing immediately
in that case, press Ctrl-C twice in short succession (within
about one second).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the result of quitting
mpg123 pressing Ctrl-C might not be audible immediately, due
to audio data buffering in the audio device. This delay is
system dependent, but it <br>
is usually not more than one or two seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PLAYBACK STATUS LINE <br>
In verbose mode, mpg123 updates a line with various
information centering around the current playback position.
On any decent terminal, the line also works as a progress
bar in <br>
the current file by reversing video for a fraction of the
line according to the current position. An example for a
full line is this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt; 0291+0955 00:01.68+00:28.22
[00:05.30] mix 100=085 192 kb/s 576 B acc 18 clip
p+0.014</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The information consists of, in
order:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt; single-character playback
state (&lsquo;&lsquo;&gt;&rsquo;&rsquo; for playing,
&lsquo;&lsquo;=&rsquo;&rsquo; for pausing/looping,
&lsquo;&lsquo;_&rsquo;&rsquo; for stopped)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0291+0955 <br>
current frame offset and number of remaining frames after
the plus sign</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">00:01.68+00:28.22 <br>
current position from and remaining time in human terms
(hours, minutes, seconds)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[00:05.30] <br>
fill of the output buffer in terms of playback time, if the
buffer is enabled</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mix selected RVA mode (possible
values: mix, alb (album), and --- (neutral, off))</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">100=085 <br>
set volume and the RVA-modified effective volume after the
equal sign</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">192 kb/s <br>
current bitrate</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">576 B size of current frame in
bytes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">acc if positions are accurate,
possible values are &lsquo;&lsquo;acc&rsquo;&rsquo; for
accurate positions or &lsquo;&lsquo;fuz&rsquo;&rsquo; for
fuzzy (with guessed byte offsets using mean frame size)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">18 clip <br>
amount of clipped samples, non-zero only if decoder reports
that (generic does, some optimized ones not)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">p+0.014 <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
MPEG audio decoding requires a good deal of CPU performance,
especially layer-3. To decode it in realtime, you should
have at least an i486DX4, Pentium, Alpha, SuperSparc or <br>
equivalent processor. You can also use the -m option to
decode mono only, which reduces the CPU load somewhat for
layer-3 streams. See also the -2 and -4 options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If everything else fails, have
mpg123 decode to a file and then use an appropriate utility
to play that file with less CPU load. Most probably you can
configure mpg123 to pro&acirc; <br>
duce a format suitable for your audio device (see above
about encodings and sampling rates).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If your system is generally fast
enough to decode in realtime, but there are sometimes
periods of heavy system load (such as cronjobs, users
logging in remotely, starting of <br>
&lsquo;&lsquo;big&rsquo;&rsquo; programs etc.) causing the
audio output to be interrupted, then you should use the -b
option to use a buffer of reasonable size (at least 1000
Kbytes).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Mostly MPEG-1 layer 2 and 3 are tested in real life. Please
report any issues and provide test files to help fixing
them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">No CRC error checking is
performed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some platforms lack audio
hardware support; you may be able to use the -s switch to
feed the decoded data to a program that can play it on your
audio device.</p>
