The make-redir program runs &quot;make&quot; in a way that redirects file
  installations to descend from the $DESTDIR directory, even if the provided
  makefile doesn't natively support $DESTDIR. In most cases, simply replace
  &quot;make install&quot; with &quot;make-redir DESTDIR= <i>directory</i>
  install&quot; (adding options as necessary).
<div class="Pp"></div>
The make-redir program attempts to solve a common problem for packagers of
  software and for users who directly install source code: Inadequate DESTDIR
  support. Software is typically installed on Unix/Linux from a source code
  package by typing &quot;make install&quot;. Historically, this script would
  write directly to privileged directories to perform the installation (e.g.,
  /usr/bin), or at least to a directory that merged all installed files (e.g.,
  $HOME/bin). However, packagers of software using most modern packaging systems
  (such as .rpm and .deb) instead require that files be written to some
  intermediate directory, even though they will be run from a different
  filesystem location. Similarly, users who directly install source code often
  use programs such as GNU stow, encap, or toast. These programs install each
  package in its own separate directory, but work best if the installed programs
  are invoked through a different directory (which merges the contents of
  multiple packages, simplifying the PATH and supporting plug-ins). Thus, for
  both many packagers of software and for many users who directly install source
  code, a program should be installed in one directory, yet actually be run from
  a different directory. This is easy to do if the installation script supports
  the &quot;DESTDIR convention&quot;; simply run &quot;make DESTDIR=
  <i>something</i> install&quot;, which would install the files descending from
  DESTDIR, even though the files are configured to run without the DESTDIR
  prefix. Unfortunately, many source packages don't support the DESTDIR
  convention.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The auto-destdir tools &quot;make-redir&quot; and &quot;run-redir&quot; will
  automatically redirect file reads/writes to follow the DESTDIR convention,
  without requiring any changes to the build files (e.g., a makefile). Attempts
  to write to directories that are normally root-privileged (such as /usr/bin)
  will instead be redirected to descend from a designated destination directory.
  This destination directory is specified by the environment variable
  REDIR_DESTDIR or DESTDIR, with REDIR_DESTDIR taking precedence.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You should use make-redir (not run-redir) if you are redirecting
  &quot;make&quot;, because make-redir performs additional helpful actions. If
  you pass DESTDIR=something as a parameter, it automatically sets the DESTDIR
  environment variable. The make-redir command also sets the overrides
  INSTALL=&quot;install&#x00A0;-p&quot; CP=&quot;cp&#x00A0;-p&quot;
  MKDIR=&quot;mkdir&quot; MKDIR_P=&quot;mkdir&#x00A0;-p&quot;
  mkdir_p=&quot;mkdir&#x00A0;-p&quot; LN=&quot;ln&quot;, so that makefiles with
  absolute pathnames of common commands will work correctly and preserve
  timestamps. (Add overrides on the command line if these are not acceptable.)
  By default make-redir also sets special SHELL and MAKESHELL values, so that
  even invocations with a full path name (like /bin/cp) will be redirected if
  they begin a line in a makefile.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Internally, make-redir runs &quot;make&quot; using run-redir; run-redir does the
  actual file redirection. Use run-redir if you need to redirect file writes
  without first running &quot;make&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The auto-destdir tools are designed to &quot;just work&quot; given the
  limitations described below (in particular, only &quot;wrapped&quot; commands
  should read/write files that must be redirected). Filenames will not be
  redirected twice, so it's safe to use run-redir and make-redir even with
  makefiles that do support DESTDIR. If a write is redirected, all parent
  directories are first automatically created if they exist in the unredirected
  filesystem. This means that an attempt to &quot;cp&quot; some file to
  /usr/bin/xyz will create the directory &quot;$DESTDIR/usr/bin&quot; if
  /usr/bin already exists, then copy the file to
  &quot;$DESTDIR/usr/bin/xyz&quot;. If a file is being read, a file written
  inside $DESTDIR will have precedence over a file that isn't; this nicely
  simulates the overwriting of an old file with a new one. Since make-redir and
  run-redir set the PATH, they will work even if there are many levels of
  indirection, and even if they use tools other than make (as long as they end
  up eventually invoking the usual commands such as cp and install).
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the &quot;make install&quot; works except that it uses a few
  &quot;unwrapped&quot; commands, consider using the &quot;-k&quot;
  (&quot;--keep-going&quot;) option, so that make-redir will keep going instead
  of failing on an error. Then, re-perform the actions that would have failed.
  Alternatively, you may be able to perform one or two actions &quot;by
  hand&quot; first, and then invoke make-redir to do the rest.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The programs make-redir and run-redir can be run as root, but in most cases, you
  should not run them as root. The installation program itself may require root
  to run (e.g., to set ownership), even if files are written to DESTDIR. If you
  just want to record permissions (e.g., chown, chmod), consider also using
  &quot;fakeroot&quot; to record the intended permissions instead of running as
  root. When creating an rpm package, the permission-setting is typically
  irrelevant, since in most cases it is the rpm spec file that will ultimately
  set the permissions. If the permission-setting is irrelevant, you may want to
  run make-redir as non-root and pass it the &quot;-k&quot;
  (&quot;--keep-going&quot;) option so that make will keep going instead of
  failing on an error.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A file/directory is not redirected if its full pathname begins as a typical user
  directory (specifically /home/ or /Users/) or temporary directory (/tmp/,
  /usr/tmp/, /var/tmp/, or /opt/tmp/). A file/directory is redirected if its
  full pathname begins with a directory name that is normally privileged: /usr/,
  /etc/, /boot/, /bin*/, /dev/, /lib*/, /opt/, /sbin*/, /selinux/, /srv/, /sys/,
  and /var/. If neither case applies, it is not redirected.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can override some values, though few will need to do so. By default,
  make-redir invokes &quot;make&quot;; this can be changed by setting the
  environment variable REALMAKE to whatever &quot;make&quot; program should be
  invoked instead. By default, make-redir sets a special SHELL value (so it can
  override commands that give full pathnames); this special value does some
  processing and then invokes /bin/bash. Set the environment variable
  REALMAKESHELL to the name of the shell to use after doing this filtering if
  you do not want it to use /bin/bash. You can disable this filtering entirely
  by setting the make variables SHELL and MAKESHELL on the command line to the
  name of the shell program to use (e.g., make-redir SHELL=/bin/sh
  MAKESHELL=/bin/sh); if make can be called recursively, also set the
  environment variables with the same name. If you do not want any makefile
  variable overrides, set the environment variable DESTDIR and use
  &quot;run-redir make ...&quot; instead.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="EXAMPLES"><a class="selflink" href="#EXAMPLES">EXAMPLES</a></h1>
The following configures, builds, and then &quot;installs&quot; a program. The
  &quot;installed&quot; files will descend from /tmp/stuff, e.g., directory
  /tmp/stuff/usr/bin will contain files that were intended to be installed in
  /usr/bin:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<pre>
 ./configure --prefix=/usr
 make
 make-redir DESTDIR=/tmp/stuff install
</pre>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
For example, if &quot;cp&#x00A0;myprogram&#x00A0;/usr/bin&quot; is one of the
  instructions in the makefile for the &quot;install&quot; target, then
  (presuming /usr/bin exists) it will actually perform the equivalent of:
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<pre>
 /bin/mkdir -p /tmp/stuff/usr/bin
 /bin/cp myprogram /tmp/stuff/usr/bin
</pre>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can use make-redir inside an RPM .spec file. Be sure to
  &quot;BuildRequires&quot; auto-destdir, and set the DESTDIR to be the RPM
  build root, as follows in the spec file:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<pre>
 ...
 BuildRequires: auto-destdir
 ...
 %install
 rm -rf &quot;$RPM_BUILD_ROOT&quot;
 make-redir DESTDIR=&quot;$RPM_BUILD_ROOT&quot; install
</pre>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Some RPM spec authors may prefer to use %{buildroot} instead of $RPM_BUILD_ROOT.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="IMPLEMENTATION_APPROACH"><a class="selflink" href="#IMPLEMENTATION_APPROACH">IMPLEMENTATION
  APPROACH</a></h1>
The auto-destdir tools (including run-redir and make-redir) work by modifying
  the PATH environment variable and providing a few &quot;wrappers&quot; that
  override typical installation commands like &quot;cp&quot; and
  &quot;install&quot;. These commands with wrappers, called &quot;wrapped
  commands&quot;, use the values of $REDIR_DESTDIR or $DESTDIR (with
  REDIR_DESTDIR taking precedence), and will redirect reads and writes of files
  under certain conditions. The &quot;redirection&quot; comes by simply changing
  the name of the file source or destination, and then calling the
  &quot;real&quot; program being wrapped. The internal function redir_name takes
  the original filename, and how it will be used (e.g., for reading or writing),
  and determines if it should be renamed (and if so, to what). In addition,
  make-redir redirects all shell commands (using SHELL and a special wrapper for
  shell commands); any command that begins with the prefix /usr/ or /usr/bin/,
  followed by a wrapped command's name, will have that prefix removed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This may seem to be an odd implementation approach, but it has many advantages.
  The &quot;obvious&quot; way to implement redirection is to manipulate
  LD_PRELOAD and wrap the open() and creat() calls. But as the fakeroot(1)
  documentation notes, this approach creates &quot;problems, as demonstrated by
  the libtricks package. This package wrapped many more functions, and tried to
  do a lot more than fakeroot. It turned out that a minor upgrade of libc (from
  one where the stat() function didn't use open() to one with a stat() function
  that did (in some cases) use open()), would cause unexplainable segfaults
  (that is, the libc6 stat() called the wrapped open(), which would then call
  the libc6 stat(), etc). Fixing them wasn't all that easy, but once fixed, it
  was just a matter of time before another function started to use
  open()...&quot;. LD_PRELOAD-based approaches fail on commands that are
  statically linked, and the commands usually used for installation (e.g., cp)
  are often statically linked. Others tools (like fakeroot) also use LD_PRELOAD,
  so using LD_PRELOAD means that these other tools cannot be used
  simultaneously. Other &quot;obvious&quot; approaches are to use ptrace(), or
  redirect file writes using the kernel (e.g. with chroot), but these turn out
  to have many problems too, as discussed in
  &lt;http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/automating-destdir.html&gt;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In contrast, since run-redir and make-redir don't manipulate LD_PRELOAD to
  manipulate open() or creat(), they are immune to deadlocks caused by changes
  in the C library, work with statically-linked commands, and work with tools
  like fakeroot. No special privileges are needed to run these programs, nor do
  they require setuid installation, eliminating many security concerns (compared
  to a chroot, setuid, or kernel-based approach). No kernel driver is used, nor
  is ptrace() used, so these tools should be fairly portable to any POSIX-based
  system with bash. All work happens very quickly, since nearly all commands
  simply run as usual, and even the wrapped commands merely run a short shell
  script before running as usual. The implementation is entirely a set of small
  bash scripts with trivial dependencies, so the auto-destdir tools can be
  easily included in a package's build process without slowing the build process
  down (even if the build process requires re-installing dependencies on each
  run).
<div class="Pp"></div>
In practice, this approach is sufficient to automate DESTDIR for typical
  installation scripts. Typical &quot;make install&quot; programs, even if they
  are deeply recursive, only use a very few commands to actually write files to
  their final locations in trusted directories, and usually invoke commands
  without using the full pathnames of the commands (e.g., &quot;install -p
  myprog /usr/bin&quot;). As a result, typical installation scripts are easily
  redirected by this program.
<div class="Pp"></div>
More information about various implementation alternatives, their pros, and
  their cons, is here: http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/automating-destdir.html
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="LIMITATIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#LIMITATIONS">LIMITATIONS</a></h1>
Only wrapped programs will be redirected to the new destination directory; any
  other program will not be redirected. Currently, the &quot;wrapped&quot;
  commands are (alphabetically):
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"><i>chmod</i>, <i>cp</i>, <i>install</i>,
  <i>ln</i>, <i>mkdir</i>, <i>mv</i>, and <i>touch</i>.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the makefile invokes wrapped programs using absolute pathnames (e.g., calling
  &quot;/bin/cp&quot; instead of &quot;cp&quot;), then the command will be
  redirected anyway if it is the absolutely first command at the beginning of a
  line in a makefile and is invoked directly or via makefile variable expansions
  like $(CP). Absolute pathnames at the <i>beginning</i> of a line are handled
  because make-redir sets SHELL to a special shell wrapper that handles this
  particular case. However, absolute pathnames for wrapped programs are not
  handled in any other place (doing so would require the shell wrapper to
  re-implement shell parsing); e.g., program names stored in shell variable
  expansions will not be intercepted. Thus, makefile lines like &quot;cd X;
  /usr/bin/install myprogram /usr/bin&quot; will not be redirected. In these
  cases, you should change absolute pathname invocations like
  <i>/usr/bin/install</i> to unnamed-path invocations like <i>install</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Capabilities built into the shell are not redirected, including I/O redirection
  such as &quot;&lt;&quot;, &quot;&gt;&quot;, and &quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;. This
  means that &quot;cat x &gt; /usr/bin/program&quot; will not be redirected; use
  &quot;cp x /usr/bin/program&quot; or similar instead. Similarly,
  &quot;test&quot; and &quot;[&quot; (which are normally shell built-ins) aren't
  redirected. Changing this would require auto-destdir to re-implement a full
  shell.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The wrappers presume GNU command line options, and will not understand other
  options even if the underlying tool would. In practice, this is almost always
  irrelevant; &quot;make install&quot; typically only uses highly-portable
  commands to copy files and make directories, and does not use unusual options.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The &quot;rm&quot; and &quot;rmdir&quot; commands are not redirected simply
  because these are unlikely commands during a &quot;make install&quot;.
  Similarly, there are no &quot;whiteout&quot; files to record when a file is
  removed from $DESTDIR, because this does not seem useful for &quot;make
  install&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In cases where this wrapper is not sufficient, you may need to modify the
  installation script. If significant modifications to the installation script
  are required, you may as well add DESTDIR support directly to the installation
  script. The auto-destdir tools are designed to handle common cases, so that
  people can focus their time on the cases that need special handling.

      &quot;install&quot; or &quot;cp&quot; to install the result.</dd>

Supporting DESTDIR is still a good idea.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="BUGS"><a class="selflink" href="#BUGS">BUGS</a></h1>
As noted above, only &quot;wrapped&quot; commands are redirected. Some commands
  that aren't wrapped, and perhaps should be, include: install-info, ldconfig,
  rm, rmdir, chown, chgrp, and libtool. For permissions-related commands (like
  chmod, chown, and chgrp), consider also using fakeroot or make's
  &quot;-k&quot; option.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Options with optional arguments cannot accept arguments that begin with
  &quot;-&quot;, due to limitations of getopt(1).
<div class="Pp"></div>
cp's --parents argument is supported, but it won't work if the original files
  are being copied from a redirected location.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When running make-redir, the makefile's SHELL value is ignored. If you need to
  use the SHELL value provided by the makefile, run make-redir and provide
  &quot;SHELL=...&quot; with the correct shell value. If you do this, wrapped
  commands must never be invoked using their full pathname.
