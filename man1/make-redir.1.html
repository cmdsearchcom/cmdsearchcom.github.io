<p>MAKE-REDIR(1) User Commands MAKE-REDIR(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
make-redir - run &quot;make&quot; but automatically redirect
its results to DESTDIR</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
make-redir [MAKE_ARGUMENT*]...[install]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* DESTDIR=directory and
-k/--keep-going are especially common.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The make-redir program runs &quot;make&quot; in a way that
redirects file installations to descend from the $DESTDIR
directory, even if the provided makefile doesn&rsquo;t
natively support <br>
$DESTDIR. In most cases, simply replace &quot;make
install&quot; with &quot;make-redir DESTDIR=directory
install&quot; (adding options as necessary).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The make-redir program attempts
to solve a common problem for packagers of software and for
users who directly install source code: Inadequate DESTDIR
support. Software is typi&acirc; <br>
cally installed on Unix/Linux from a source code package by
typing &quot;make install&quot;. Historically, this script
would write directly to privileged directories to perform
the <br>
installation (e.g., /usr/bin), or at least to a directory
that merged all installed files (e.g., $HOME/bin). However,
packagers of software using most modern packaging systems
<br>
(such as .rpm and .deb) instead require that files be
written to some intermediate directory, even though they
will be run from a different filesystem location. Similarly,
users <br>
who directly install source code often use programs such as
GNU stow, encap, or toast. These programs install each
package in its own separate directory, but work best if the
<br>
installed programs are invoked through a different directory
(which merges the contents of multiple packages, simplifying
the PATH and supporting plug-ins). Thus, for both many <br>
packagers of software and for many users who directly
install source code, a program should be installed in one
directory, yet actually be run from a different directory.
This <br>
is easy to do if the installation script supports the
&quot;DESTDIR convention&quot;; simply run &quot;make
DESTDIR=something install&quot;, which would install the
files descending from DESTDIR, <br>
even though the files are configured to run without the
DESTDIR prefix. Unfortunately, many source packages
don&rsquo;t support the DESTDIR convention.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The auto-destdir tools
&quot;make-redir&quot; and &quot;run-redir&quot; will
automatically redirect file reads/writes to follow the
DESTDIR convention, without requiring any changes to the
build <br>
files (e.g., a makefile). Attempts to write to directories
that are normally root-privileged (such as /usr/bin) will
instead be redirected to descend from a designated
destina&acirc; <br>
tion directory. This destination directory is specified by
the environment variable REDIR_DESTDIR or DESTDIR, with
REDIR_DESTDIR taking precedence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You should use make-redir (not
run-redir) if you are redirecting &quot;make&quot;, because
make-redir performs additional helpful actions. If you pass
DESTDIR=something as a parameter, it <br>
automatically sets the DESTDIR environment variable. The
make-redir command also sets the overrides
INSTALL=&quot;install -p&quot; CP=&quot;cp -p&quot;
MKDIR=&quot;mkdir&quot; MKDIR_P=&quot;mkdir -p&quot; <br>
mkdir_p=&quot;mkdir -p&quot; LN=&quot;ln&quot;, so that
makefiles with absolute pathnames of common commands will
work correctly and preserve timestamps. (Add overrides on
the command line if these <br>
are not acceptable.) By default make-redir also sets special
SHELL and MAKESHELL values, so that even invocations with a
full path name (like /bin/cp) will be redirected if they
<br>
begin a line in a makefile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Internally, make-redir runs
&quot;make&quot; using run-redir; run-redir does the actual
file redirection. Use run-redir if you need to redirect file
writes without first running &quot;make&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The auto-destdir tools are
designed to &quot;just work&quot; given the limitations
described below (in particular, only &quot;wrapped&quot;
commands should read/write files that must be redirected).
<br>
Filenames will not be redirected twice, so it&rsquo;s safe
to use run-redir and make-redir even with makefiles that do
support DESTDIR. If a write is redirected, all parent
directo&acirc; <br>
ries are first automatically created if they exist in the
unredirected filesystem. This means that an attempt to
&quot;cp&quot; some file to /usr/bin/xyz will create the
directory &quot;$DEST&acirc; <br>
DIR/usr/bin&quot; if /usr/bin already exists, then copy the
file to &quot;$DESTDIR/usr/bin/xyz&quot;. If a file is being
read, a file written inside $DESTDIR will have precedence
over a file <br>
that isn&rsquo;t; this nicely simulates the overwriting of
an old file with a new one. Since make-redir and run-redir
set the PATH, they will work even if there are many levels
of <br>
indirection, and even if they use tools other than make (as
long as they end up eventually invoking the usual commands
such as cp and install).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the &quot;make install&quot;
works except that it uses a few &quot;unwrapped&quot;
commands, consider using the &quot;-k&quot;
(&quot;--keep-going&quot;) option, so that make-redir will
keep going instead of failing <br>
on an error. Then, re-perform the actions that would have
failed. Alternatively, you may be able to perform one or two
actions &quot;by hand&quot; first, and then invoke
make-redir to do <br>
the rest.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The programs make-redir and
run-redir can be run as root, but in most cases, you should
not run them as root. The installation program itself may
require root to run (e.g., to <br>
set ownership), even if files are written to DESTDIR. If you
just want to record permissions (e.g., chown, chmod),
consider also using &quot;fakeroot&quot; to record the
intended permis&acirc; <br>
sions instead of running as root. When creating an rpm
package, the permission-setting is typically irrelevant,
since in most cases it is the rpm spec file that will
ultimately <br>
set the permissions. If the permission-setting is
irrelevant, you may want to run make-redir as non-root and
pass it the &quot;-k&quot; (&quot;--keep-going&quot;) option
so that make will keep <br>
going instead of failing on an error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A file/directory is not
redirected if its full pathname begins as a typical user
directory (specifically /home/ or /Users/) or temporary
directory (/tmp/, /usr/tmp/, /var/tmp/, <br>
or /opt/tmp/). A file/directory is redirected if its full
pathname begins with a directory name that is normally
privileged: /usr/, /etc/, /boot/, /bin*/, /dev/, /lib*/,
/opt/, <br>
/sbin*/, /selinux/, /srv/, /sys/, and /var/. If neither case
applies, it is not redirected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can override some values,
though few will need to do so. By default, make-redir
invokes &quot;make&quot;; this can be changed by setting the
environment variable REALMAKE to whatever <br>
&quot;make&quot; program should be invoked instead. By
default, make-redir sets a special SHELL value (so it can
override commands that give full pathnames); this special
value does some <br>
processing and then invokes /bin/bash. Set the environment
variable REALMAKESHELL to the name of the shell to use after
doing this filtering if you do not want it to use <br>
/bin/bash. You can disable this filtering entirely by
setting the make variables SHELL and MAKESHELL on the
command line to the name of the shell program to use (e.g.,
make- <br>
redir SHELL=/bin/sh MAKESHELL=/bin/sh); if make can be
called recursively, also set the environment variables with
the same name. If you do not want any makefile variable
over&acirc; <br>
rides, set the environment variable DESTDIR and use
&quot;run-redir make ...&quot; instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
The following configures, builds, and then
&quot;installs&quot; a program. The &quot;installed&quot;
files will descend from /tmp/stuff, e.g., directory
/tmp/stuff/usr/bin will contain files that <br>
were intended to be installed in /usr/bin:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">./configure --prefix=/usr <br>
make <br>
make-redir DESTDIR=/tmp/stuff install</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, if &quot;cp
myprogram /usr/bin&quot; is one of the instructions in the
makefile for the &quot;install&quot; target, then (presuming
/usr/bin exists) it will actually perform the equiva&acirc;
<br>
lent of: <br>
/bin/mkdir -p /tmp/stuff/usr/bin <br>
/bin/cp myprogram /tmp/stuff/usr/bin</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can use make-redir inside an
RPM .spec file. Be sure to &quot;BuildRequires&quot;
auto-destdir, and set the DESTDIR to be the RPM build root,
as follows in the spec file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">... <br>
BuildRequires: auto-destdir <br>
... <br>
%install <br>
rm -rf &quot;$RPM_BUILD_ROOT&quot; <br>
make-redir DESTDIR=&quot;$RPM_BUILD_ROOT&quot; install</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some RPM spec authors may prefer
to use %{buildroot} instead of $RPM_BUILD_ROOT.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH <br>
The auto-destdir tools (including run-redir and make-redir)
work by modifying the PATH environment variable and
providing a few &quot;wrappers&quot; that override typical
installation com&acirc; <br>
mands like &quot;cp&quot; and &quot;install&quot;. These
commands with wrappers, called &quot;wrapped commands&quot;,
use the values of $REDIR_DESTDIR or $DESTDIR (with
REDIR_DESTDIR taking precedence), and <br>
will redirect reads and writes of files under certain
conditions. The &quot;redirection&quot; comes by simply
changing the name of the file source or destination, and
then calling the <br>
&quot;real&quot; program being wrapped. The internal
function redir_name takes the original filename, and how it
will be used (e.g., for reading or writing), and determines
if it should <br>
be renamed (and if so, to what). In addition, make-redir
redirects all shell commands (using SHELL and a special
wrapper for shell commands); any command that begins with
the <br>
prefix /usr/ or /usr/bin/, followed by a wrapped
command&rsquo;s name, will have that prefix removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This may seem to be an odd
implementation approach, but it has many advantages. The
&quot;obvious&quot; way to implement redirection is to
manipulate LD_PRELOAD and wrap the open() and <br>
creat() calls. But as the fakeroot(1) documentation notes,
this approach creates &quot;problems, as demonstrated by the
libtricks package. This package wrapped many more functions,
<br>
and tried to do a lot more than fakeroot. It turned out that
a minor upgrade of libc (from one where the stat() function
didn&rsquo;t use open() to one with a stat() function that
did <br>
(in some cases) use open()), would cause unexplainable
segfaults (that is, the libc6 stat() called the wrapped
open(), which would then call the libc6 stat(), etc). Fixing
them <br>
wasn&rsquo;t all that easy, but once fixed, it was just a
matter of time before another function started to use
open()...&quot;. LD_PRELOAD-based approaches fail on
commands that are stat&acirc; <br>
ically linked, and the commands usually used for
installation (e.g., cp) are often statically linked. Others
tools (like fakeroot) also use LD_PRELOAD, so using
LD_PRELOAD means <br>
that these other tools cannot be used simultaneously. Other
&quot;obvious&quot; approaches are to use ptrace(), or
redirect file writes using the kernel (e.g. with chroot),
but these turn <br>
out to have many problems too, as discussed in
&lt;http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/automating-destdir.html&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In contrast, since run-redir and
make-redir don&rsquo;t manipulate LD_PRELOAD to manipulate
open() or creat(), they are immune to deadlocks caused by
changes in the C library, work <br>
with statically-linked commands, and work with tools like
fakeroot. No special privileges are needed to run these
programs, nor do they require setuid installation,
eliminating <br>
many security concerns (compared to a chroot, setuid, or
kernel-based approach). No kernel driver is used, nor is
ptrace() used, so these tools should be fairly portable to
any <br>
POSIX-based system with bash. All work happens very quickly,
since nearly all commands simply run as usual, and even the
wrapped commands merely run a short shell script before <br>
running as usual. The implementation is entirely a set of
small bash scripts with trivial dependencies, so the
auto-destdir tools can be easily included in a
package&rsquo;s build <br>
process without slowing the build process down (even if the
build process requires re-installing dependencies on each
run).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In practice, this approach is
sufficient to automate DESTDIR for typical installation
scripts. Typical &quot;make install&quot; programs, even if
they are deeply recursive, only use a <br>
very few commands to actually write files to their final
locations in trusted directories, and usually invoke
commands without using the full pathnames of the commands
(e.g., <br>
&quot;install -p myprog /usr/bin&quot;). As a result,
typical installation scripts are easily redirected by this
program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">More information about various
implementation alternatives, their pros, and their cons, is
here:
http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/automating-destdir.html</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LIMITATIONS <br>
Only wrapped programs will be redirected to the new
destination directory; any other program will not be
redirected. Currently, the &quot;wrapped&quot; commands are
(alphabetically):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">chmod, cp, install, ln, mkdir,
mv, and touch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the makefile invokes wrapped
programs using absolute pathnames (e.g., calling
&quot;/bin/cp&quot; instead of &quot;cp&quot;), then the
command will be redirected anyway if it is the absolutely
<br>
first command at the beginning of a line in a makefile and
is invoked directly or via makefile variable expansions like
$(CP). Absolute pathnames at the beginning of a line are
<br>
handled because make-redir sets SHELL to a special shell
wrapper that handles this particular case. However, absolute
pathnames for wrapped programs are not handled in any other
<br>
place (doing so would require the shell wrapper to
re-implement shell parsing); e.g., program names stored in
shell variable expansions will not be intercepted. Thus,
makefile <br>
lines like &quot;cd X; /usr/bin/install myprogram
/usr/bin&quot; will not be redirected. In these cases, you
should change absolute pathname invocations like
/usr/bin/install to unnamed- <br>
path invocations like install.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Capabilities built into the
shell are not redirected, including I/O redirection such as
&quot;&lt;&quot;, &quot;&gt;&quot;, and
&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;. This means that &quot;cat x &gt;
/usr/bin/program&quot; will not be redirected; <br>
use &quot;cp x /usr/bin/program&quot; or similar instead.
Similarly, &quot;test&quot; and &quot;[&quot; (which are
normally shell built-ins) aren&rsquo;t redirected. Changing
this would require auto-destdir to <br>
re-implement a full shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The wrappers presume GNU command
line options, and will not understand other options even if
the underlying tool would. In practice, this is almost
always irrelevant; &quot;make <br>
install&quot; typically only uses highly-portable commands
to copy files and make directories, and does not use unusual
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;rm&quot; and
&quot;rmdir&quot; commands are not redirected simply because
these are unlikely commands during a &quot;make
install&quot;. Similarly, there are no &quot;whiteout&quot;
files to record when a <br>
file is removed from $DESTDIR, because this does not seem
useful for &quot;make install&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In cases where this wrapper is
not sufficient, you may need to modify the installation
script. If significant modifications to the installation
script are required, you may as <br>
well add DESTDIR support directly to the installation
script. The auto-destdir tools are designed to handle common
cases, so that people can focus their time on the cases that
<br>
need special handling.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GUIDANCE FOR SOFTWARE CREATORS
<br>
When writing the commands for &quot;make install&quot;:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Only use the
wrapped commands to install files and directories in their
final positions (e.g., install, cp, ln, and mkdir).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Don&rsquo;t use
full pathnames of wrapped commands (e.g.,
&quot;/usr/bin/install&quot;); use their basename (e.g.,
&quot;install&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Don&rsquo;t use
redirection (e.g., &quot;&gt;&quot;) to write to files in
privileged directories; use redirection to write to a
&quot;local&quot; file (typically during the build process),
and then use <br>
&quot;install&quot; or &quot;cp&quot; to install the
result.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Supporting DESTDIR is still a
good idea.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
As noted above, only &quot;wrapped&quot; commands are
redirected. Some commands that aren&rsquo;t wrapped, and
perhaps should be, include: install-info, ldconfig, rm,
rmdir, chown, chgrp, and <br>
libtool. For permissions-related commands (like chmod,
chown, and chgrp), consider also using fakeroot or
make&rsquo;s &quot;-k&quot; option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options with optional arguments
cannot accept arguments that begin with &quot;-&quot;, due
to limitations of getopt(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cp&rsquo;s --parents argument is
supported, but it won&rsquo;t work if the original files are
being copied from a redirected location.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When running make-redir, the
makefile&rsquo;s SHELL value is ignored. If you need to use
the SHELL value provided by the makefile, run make-redir and
provide &quot;SHELL=...&quot; with the cor&acirc; <br>
rect shell value. If you do this, wrapped commands must
never be invoked using their full pathname.</p>
