<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pdfresurrect - tool for extracting versioning data from PDF
documents</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pdfresurrect file.pdf [-w][-q][-s][-i]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This manual page documents briefly the pdfresurrect
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pdfresurrect is a tool for
extracting versioning data from PDF documents.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
A summary of options is included below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w Write the PDF versions and
summary to disk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Display only the number of
versions contained in the PDF.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Scrub the previous history
data from the specified PDF.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i Display the creator
information from the specified PDF.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
The scrubbing feature (-s) should not be trusted for any
serious security uses. After using this feature, please
verify that it in fact zero&rsquo;d all of the objects that
were of <br>
concern.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This tool relies on the
application reading the pdfresurrect extracted versions to
treat the last xref(cross-reference) table as the most
recent in the document. This should <br>
typically be the case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The verbose output, which tries
to deduce the PDF object type (e.g. stream, page), is not
always accurate, and the object counts might not be 100%
accurate. However, this should <br>
not prevent the extraction of the versions. This output is
merely to provide a hint for the user as to what might be
different between the documents.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Object counts might appear off
in linearized PDF documents. That is not truly the case, the
reason for this is that each version of the PDF consists of
the objects that compose <br>
the linear portion of the PDF plus all of the objects that
compose the version in question. Suppose there is a
linearized PDF with 59 objects in its linear portion, and
suppose <br>
the PDF has a second version that consists of 21 objects.
The total number of objects in &quot;version 2&quot; would
be 59 + 21 or 80 objects.</p>
