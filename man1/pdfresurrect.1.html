<b>pdfresurrect</b> is a tool for extracting versioning data from PDF documents.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
A summary of options is included below.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-w</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Write the PDF versions and summary to disk.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-q</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Display only the number of versions contained in the
    PDF.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-s</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Scrub the previous history data from the specified
    PDF.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-i</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Display the creator information from the specified
    PDF.</dd>
</dl>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="NOTES"><a class="selflink" href="#NOTES">NOTES</a></h1>
The scrubbing feature (-s) should not be trusted for any serious security uses.
  After using this feature, please verify that it in fact zero'd all of the
  objects that were of concern.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This tool relies on the application reading the pdfresurrect extracted versions
  to treat the last xref(cross-reference) table as the most recent in the
  document. This should typically be the case.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The verbose output, which tries to deduce the PDF object type (e.g. stream,
  page), is not always accurate, and the object counts might not be 100%
  accurate. However, this should not prevent the extraction of the versions.
  This output is merely to provide a hint for the user as to what might be
  different between the documents.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Object counts might appear off in linearized PDF documents. That is not truly
  the case, the reason for this is that each version of the PDF consists of the
  objects that compose the linear portion of the PDF plus all of the objects
  that compose the version in question. Suppose there is a linearized PDF with
  59 objects in its linear portion, and suppose the PDF has a second version
  that consists of 21 objects. The total number of objects in &quot;version
  2&quot; would be 59 + 21 or 80 objects.
