pcretest - a program for testing Perl-compatible regular expressions.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<b>pcretest [options] [input file [output file]]</b>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>pcretest</b> was written as a test program for the PCRE regular expression
  library itself, but it can also be used for experimenting with regular
  expressions. This document describes the features of the test program; for
  details of the regular expressions themselves, see the <b>pcrepattern</b>
  documentation. For details of the PCRE library function calls and their
  options, see the <b>pcreapi</b> , <b>pcre16</b> and <b>pcre32</b>
  documentation.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The input for <b>pcretest</b> is a sequence of regular expression patterns and
  strings to be matched, as described below. The output shows the result of each
  match. Options on the command line and the patterns control PCRE options and
  exactly what is output.
<div class="Pp"></div>
As PCRE has evolved, it has acquired many different features, and as a result,
  <b>pcretest</b> now has rather a lot of obscure options for testing every
  possible feature. Some of these options are specifically designed for use in
  conjunction with the test script and data files that are distributed as part
  of PCRE, and are unlikely to be of use otherwise. They are all documented
  here, but without much justification.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="PCRE's_8-BIT,_16-BIT_AND_32-BIT_LIBRARIES"><a class="selflink" href="#PCRE's_8-BIT,_16-BIT_AND_32-BIT_LIBRARIES">PCRE's
  8-BIT, 16-BIT AND 32-BIT LIBRARIES</a></h1>
From release 8.30, two separate PCRE libraries can be built. The original one
  supports 8-bit character strings, whereas the newer 16-bit library supports
  character strings encoded in 16-bit units. From release 8.32, a third library
  can be built, supporting character strings encoded in 32-bit units. The
  <b>pcretest</b> program can be used to test all three libraries. However, it
  is itself still an 8-bit program, reading 8-bit input and writing 8-bit
  output. When testing the 16-bit or 32-bit library, the patterns and data
  strings are converted to 16- or 32-bit format before being passed to the PCRE
  library functions. Results are converted to 8-bit for output.

      the JIT compile options are passed to <b>pcre[16|32]_study()</b>, causing
      just-in-time optimization to be set up if it is available, for both full
      and partial matching. Specific JIT compile options can be selected by
      following <b>-s+</b> with a digit in the range 1 to 7, which selects the
      JIT compile modes as follows:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>

     1 normal match only

    If <b>-s++</b> is used instead of <b>-s+</b> (with or without a following
      digit), the text &quot;(JIT)&quot; is added to the first output line after
      a match or no match when JIT-compiled code was actually used.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Note that there are pattern options that can override <b>-s</b>, either
      specifying no studying at all, or suppressing JIT compilation.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If the <b>/I</b> or <b>/D</b> option is present on a pattern (requesting
      output about the compiled pattern), information about the result of
      studying is not included when studying is caused only by <b>-s</b> and
      neither <b>-i</b> nor <b>-d</b> is present on the command line. This
      behaviour means that the output from tests that are run with and without
      <b>-s</b> should be identical, except when options that output information
      about the actual running of a match are set.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The <b>-M</b>, <b>-t</b>, and <b>-tm</b> options, which give information
      about resources used, are likely to produce different output with and
      without <b>-s</b>. Output may also differ if the <b>/C</b> option is
      present on an individual pattern. This uses callouts to trace the the
      matching process, and this may be different between studied and
      non-studied patterns. If the pattern contains (*MARK) items there may also
      be differences, for the same reason. The <b>-s</b> command line option can
      be overridden for specific patterns that should never be studied (see the
      <b>/S</b> pattern modifier below).</dd>

      set <b>-m</b> with <b>-t</b>, because you will then get the size output a
      zillion times, and the timing will be distorted. You can control the
      number of iterations that are used for timing by following <b>-t</b> with
      a number (as a separate item on the command line). For example, &quot;-t
      1000&quot; would iterate 1000 times. The default is to iterate 500000

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
If <b>pcretest</b> is given two filename arguments, it reads from the first and
  writes to the second. If it is given only one filename argument, it reads from
  that file and writes to stdout. Otherwise, it reads from stdin and writes to
  stdout, and prompts for each line of input, using &quot;re&gt;&quot; to prompt
  for regular expressions, and &quot;data&gt;&quot; to prompt for data lines.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When <b>pcretest</b> is built, a configuration option can specify that it should
  be linked with the <b>libreadline</b> library. When this is done, if the input
  is from a terminal, it is read using the <b>readline()</b> function. This
  provides line-editing and history facilities. The output from the <b>-help</b>
  option states whether or not <b>readline()</b> will be used.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The program handles any number of sets of input on a single input file. Each set
  starts with a regular expression, and continues with any number of data lines
  to be matched against the pattern.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Each data line is matched separately and independently. If you want to do
  multi-line matches, you have to use the \n escape sequence (or \r or \r\n,
  etc., depending on the newline setting) in a single line of input to encode
  the newline sequences. There is no limit on the length of data lines; the
  input buffer is automatically extended if it is too small.
<div class="Pp"></div>
An empty line signals the end of the data lines, at which point a new regular
  expression is read. The regular expressions are given enclosed in any
  non-alphanumeric delimiters other than backslash, for example:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 /(a|bc)x+yz/
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
White space before the initial delimiter is ignored. A regular expression may be
  continued over several input lines, in which case the newline characters are
  included within it. It is possible to include the delimiter within the pattern
  by escaping it, for example
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 /abc\/def/
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If you do so, the escape and the delimiter form part of the pattern, but since
  delimiters are always non-alphanumeric, this does not affect its
  interpretation. If the terminating delimiter is immediately followed by a
  backslash, for example,
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 /abc/\
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
then a backslash is added to the end of the pattern. This is done to provide a
  way of testing the error condition that arises if a pattern finishes with a
  backslash, because
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 /abc\/
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
is interpreted as the first line of a pattern that starts with &quot;abc/&quot;,
  causing pcretest to read the next line as a continuation of the regular
  expression.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="PATTERN_MODIFIERS"><a class="selflink" href="#PATTERN_MODIFIERS">PATTERN
  MODIFIERS</a></h1>
A pattern may be followed by any number of modifiers, which are mostly single
  characters, though some of these can be qualified by further characters.
  Following Perl usage, these are referred to below as, for example, &quot;the
  <b>/i</b> modifier&quot;, even though the delimiter of the pattern need not
  always be a slash, and no slash is used when writing modifiers. White space
  may appear between the final pattern delimiter and the first modifier, and
  between the modifiers themselves. For reference, here is a complete list of
  modifiers. They fall into several groups that are described in detail in the
  following sections.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>

The <b>/i</b>, <b>/m</b>, <b>/s</b>, and <b>/x</b> modifiers set the

  respectively, when <b>pcre[16|32]_compile()</b> is called. These four modifier
  letters have the same effect as they do in Perl. For example:

The modifiers that are enclosed in angle brackets are literal strings as shown,
  including the angle brackets, but the letters within can be in either case.
  This example sets multiline matching with CRLF as the line ending sequence:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 /^abc/m&lt;CRLF&gt;
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
As well as turning on the PCRE_UTF8/16/32 option, the <b>/8</b> modifier causes
  all non-printing characters in output strings to be printed using the
  \x{hh...} notation. Otherwise, those less than 0x100 are output in hex without
  the curly brackets.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Full details of the PCRE options are given in the <b>pcreapi</b> documentation.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Finding_all_matches_in_a_string"><a class="selflink" href="#Finding_all_matches_in_a_string">Finding
  all matches in a string</a></h2>
Searching for all possible matches within each subject string can be requested
  by the <b>/g</b> or <b>/G</b> modifier. After finding a match, PCRE is called
  again to search the remainder of the subject string. The difference between
  <b>/g</b> and <b>/G</b> is that the former uses the <i>startoffset</i>
  argument to <b>pcre[16|32]_exec()</b> to start searching at a new point within
  the entire string (which is in effect what Perl does), whereas the latter
  passes over a shortened substring. This makes a difference to the matching
  process if the pattern begins with a lookbehind assertion (including \b or
  \B).
<div class="Pp"></div>
If any call to <b>pcre[16|32]_exec()</b> in a <b>/g</b> or <b>/G</b> sequence
  matches an empty string, the next call is done with the PCRE_NOTEMPTY_ATSTART
  and PCRE_ANCHORED flags set in order to search for another, non-empty, match
  at the same point. If this second match fails, the start offset is advanced,
  and the normal match is retried. This imitates the way Perl handles such cases
  when using the <b>/g</b> modifier or the <b>split()</b> function. Normally,
  the start offset is advanced by one character, but if the newline convention
  recognizes CRLF as a newline, and the current character is CR followed by LF,
  an advance of two is used.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Other_modifiers"><a class="selflink" href="#Other_modifiers">Other
  modifiers</a></h2>
There are yet more modifiers for controlling the way <b>pcretest</b> operates.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>/+</b> modifier requests that as well as outputting the substring that
  matched the entire pattern, <b>pcretest</b> should in addition output the
  remainder of the subject string. This is useful for tests where the subject
  contains multiple copies of the same substring. If the <b>+</b> modifier
  appears twice, the same action is taken for captured substrings. In each case
  the remainder is output on the following line with a plus character following
  the capture number. Note that this modifier must not immediately follow the /S
  modifier because /S+ and /S++ have other meanings.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>/=</b> modifier requests that the values of all potential captured
  parentheses be output after a match. By default, only those up to the highest
  one actually used in the match are output (corresponding to the return code
  from <b>pcre[16|32]_exec()</b>). Values in the offsets vector corresponding to
  higher numbers should be set to -1, and these are output as
  &quot;&lt;unset&gt;&quot;. This modifier gives a way of checking that this is
  happening.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>/B</b> modifier is a debugging feature. It requests that <b>pcretest</b>
  output a representation of the compiled code after compilation. Normally this
  information contains length and offset values; however, if <b>/Z</b> is also
  present, this data is replaced by spaces. This is a special feature for use in
  the automatic test scripts; it ensures that the same output is generated for
  different internal link sizes.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>/D</b> modifier is a PCRE debugging feature, and is equivalent to
  <b>/BI</b>, that is, both the <b>/B</b> and the <b>/I</b> modifiers.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>/F</b> modifier causes <b>pcretest</b> to flip the byte order of the
  2-byte and 4-byte fields in the compiled pattern. This facility is for testing
  the feature in PCRE that allows it to execute patterns that were compiled on a
  host with a different endianness. This feature is not available when the POSIX
  interface to PCRE is being used, that is, when the <b>/P</b> pattern modifier
  is specified. See also the section about saving and reloading compiled
  patterns below.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>/I</b> modifier requests that <b>pcretest</b> output information about
  the compiled pattern (whether it is anchored, has a fixed first character, and
  so on). It does this by calling <b>pcre[16|32]_fullinfo()</b> after compiling
  a pattern. If the pattern is studied, the results of that are also output.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>/K</b> modifier requests <b>pcretest</b> to show names from backtracking
  control verbs that are returned from calls to <b>pcre[16|32]_exec()</b>. It
  causes <b>pcretest</b> to create a <b>pcre[16|32]_extra</b> block if one has
  not already been created by a call to <b>pcre[16|32]_study()</b>, and to set
  the PCRE_EXTRA_MARK flag and the <b>mark</b> field within it, every time that
  <b>pcre[16|32]_exec()</b> is called. If the variable that the <b>mark</b>
  field points to is non-NULL for a match, non-match, or partial match,
  <b>pcretest</b> prints the string to which it points. For a match, this is
  shown on a line by itself, tagged with &quot;MK:&quot;. For a non-match it is
  added to the message.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>/L</b> modifier must be followed directly by the name of a locale, for
  example,
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 /pattern/Lfr_FR
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
For this reason, it must be the last modifier. The given locale is set,
  <b>pcre[16|32]_maketables()</b> is called to build a set of character tables
  for the locale, and this is then passed to <b>pcre[16|32]_compile()</b> when
  compiling the regular expression. Without an <b>/L</b> (or <b>/T</b>)
  modifier, NULL is passed as the tables pointer; that is, <b>/L</b> applies
  only to the expression on which it appears.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>/M</b> modifier causes the size in bytes of the memory block used to hold
  the compiled pattern to be output. This does not include the size of the
  <b>pcre[16|32]</b> block; it is just the actual compiled data. If the pattern
  is successfully studied with the PCRE_STUDY_JIT_COMPILE option, the size of
  the JIT compiled code is also output.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>/S</b> modifier causes <b>pcre[16|32]_study()</b> to be called after the
  expression has been compiled, and the results used when the expression is
  matched. There are a number of qualifying characters that may follow
  <b>/S</b>. They may appear in any order.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If <b>S</b> is followed by an exclamation mark, <b>pcre[16|32]_study()</b> is
  called with the PCRE_STUDY_EXTRA_NEEDED option, causing it always to return a
  <b>pcre_extra</b> block, even when studying discovers no useful information.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If <b>/S</b> is followed by a second S character, it suppresses studying, even
  if it was requested externally by the <b>-s</b> command line option. This
  makes it possible to specify that certain patterns are always studied, and
  others are never studied, independently of <b>-s</b>. This feature is used in
  the test files in a few cases where the output is different when the pattern
  is studied.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the <b>/S</b> modifier is followed by a + character, the call to
  <b>pcre[16|32]_study()</b> is made with all the JIT study options, requesting
  just-in-time optimization support if it is available, for both normal and
  partial matching. If you want to restrict the JIT compiling modes, you can
  follow <b>/S+</b> with a digit in the range 1 to 7:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 1 normal match only
<br/>
 2 soft partial match only
<br/>
 3 normal match and soft partial match
<br/>
 4 hard partial match only
<br/>
 6 soft and hard partial match
<br/>
 7 all three modes (default)
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If <b>/S++</b> is used instead of <b>/S+</b> (with or without a following
  digit), the text &quot;(JIT)&quot; is added to the first output line after a
  match or no match when JIT-compiled code was actually used.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that there is also an independent <b>/+</b> modifier; it must not be given
  immediately after <b>/S</b> or <b>/S+</b> because this will be misinterpreted.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If JIT studying is successful, the compiled JIT code will automatically be used
  when <b>pcre[16|32]_exec()</b> is run, except when incompatible run-time
  options are specified. For more details, see the <b>pcrejit</b> documentation.
  See also the <b>\J</b> escape sequence below for a way of setting the size of
  the JIT stack.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Finally, if <b>/S</b> is followed by a minus character, JIT compilation is
  suppressed, even if it was requested externally by the <b>-s</b> command line
  option. This makes it possible to specify that JIT is never to be used for
  certain patterns.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>/T</b> modifier must be followed by a single digit. It causes a specific
  set of built-in character tables to be passed to <b>pcre[16|32]_compile()</b>.
  It is used in the standard PCRE tests to check behaviour with different
  character tables. The digit specifies the tables as follows:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 0 the default ASCII tables, as distributed in
<br/>
 pcre_chartables.c.dist
<br/>
 1 a set of tables defining ISO 8859 characters
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
In table 1, some characters whose codes are greater than 128 are identified as
  letters, digits, spaces, etc.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Using_the_POSIX_wrapper_API"><a class="selflink" href="#Using_the_POSIX_wrapper_API">Using
  the POSIX wrapper API</a></h2>
The <b>/P</b> modifier causes <b>pcretest</b> to call PCRE via the POSIX wrapper
  API rather than its native API. This supports only the 8-bit library. When
  <b>/P</b> is set, the following modifiers set options for the <b>regcomp()</b>
  function:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 /i REG_ICASE
<br/>
 /m REG_NEWLINE
<br/>
 /N REG_NOSUB
<br/>
 /s REG_DOTALL )
<br/>
 /U REG_UNGREEDY ) These options are not part of
<br/>
 /W REG_UCP ) the POSIX standard
<br/>
 /8 REG_UTF8 )
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The <b>/+</b> modifier works as described above. All other modifiers are
  ignored.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DATA_LINES"><a class="selflink" href="#DATA_LINES">DATA
  LINES</a></h1>
Before each data line is passed to <b>pcre[16|32]_exec()</b>, leading and
  trailing white space is removed, and it is then scanned for \ escapes. Some of
  these are pretty esoteric features, intended for checking out some of the more
  complicated features of PCRE. If you are just testing &quot;ordinary&quot;
  regular expressions, you probably don't need any of these. The following
  escapes are recognized:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 \a alarm (BEL, \x07)
<br/>
 \b backspace (\x08)

<br/>
 or <b>pcre[16|32]_dfa_exec()</b>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The use of \x{hh...} is not dependent on the use of the <b>/8</b> modifier on
  the pattern. It is recognized always. There may be any number of hexadecimal
  digits inside the braces; invalid values provoke error messages.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that \xhh specifies one byte rather than one character in UTF-8 mode; this
  makes it possible to construct invalid UTF-8 sequences for testing purposes.
  On the other hand, \x{hh} is interpreted as a UTF-8 character in UTF-8 mode,
  generating more than one byte if the value is greater than 127. When testing
  the 8-bit library not in UTF-8 mode, \x{hh} generates one byte for values less
  than 256, and causes an error for greater values.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In UTF-16 mode, all 4-digit \x{hhhh} values are accepted. This makes it possible
  to construct invalid UTF-16 sequences for testing purposes.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In UTF-32 mode, all 4- to 8-digit \x{...} values are accepted. This makes it
  possible to construct invalid UTF-32 sequences for testing purposes.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The escapes that specify line ending sequences are literal strings, exactly as
  shown. No more than one newline setting should be present in any data line.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A backslash followed by anything else just escapes the anything else. If the
  very last character is a backslash, it is ignored. This gives a way of passing
  an empty line as data, since a real empty line terminates the data input.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>\J</b> escape provides a way of setting the maximum stack size that is
  used by the just-in-time optimization code. It is ignored if JIT optimization
  is not being used. Providing a stack that is larger than the default 32K is
  necessary only for very complicated patterns.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If \M is present, <b>pcretest</b> calls <b>pcre[16|32]_exec()</b> several times,
  with different values in the <i>match_limit</i> and
  <i>match_limit_recursion</i> fields of the <b>pcre[16|32]_extra</b> data
  structure, until it finds the minimum numbers for each parameter that allow
  <b>pcre[16|32]_exec()</b> to complete without error. Because this is testing a
  specific feature of the normal interpretive <b>pcre[16|32]_exec()</b>
  execution, the use of any JIT optimization that might have been set up by the
  <b>/S+</b> qualifier of <b>-s+</b> option is disabled.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <i>match_limit</i> number is a measure of the amount of backtracking that
  takes place, and checking it out can be instructive. For most simple matches,
  the number is quite small, but for patterns with very large numbers of
  matching possibilities, it can become large very quickly with increasing
  length of subject string. The <i>match_limit_recursion</i> number is a measure
  of how much stack (or, if PCRE is compiled with NO_RECURSE, how much heap)
  memory is needed to complete the match attempt.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When \O is used, the value specified may be higher or lower than the size set by
  the <b>-O</b> command line option (or defaulted to 45); \O applies only to the
  call of <b>pcre[16|32]_exec()</b> for the line in which it appears.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the <b>/P</b> modifier was present on the pattern, causing the POSIX wrapper
  API to be used, the only option-setting sequences that have any effect are \B,
  \N, and \Z, causing REG_NOTBOL, REG_NOTEMPTY, and REG_NOTEOL, respectively, to
  be passed to <b>regexec()</b>.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="THE_ALTERNATIVE_MATCHING_FUNCTION"><a class="selflink" href="#THE_ALTERNATIVE_MATCHING_FUNCTION">THE
  ALTERNATIVE MATCHING FUNCTION</a></h1>
By default, <b>pcretest</b> uses the standard PCRE matching function,
  <b>pcre[16|32]_exec()</b> to match each data line. PCRE also supports an
  alternative matching function, <b>pcre[16|32]_dfa_test()</b>, which operates
  in a different way, and has some restrictions. The differences between the two
  functions are described in the <b>pcrematching</b> documentation.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If a data line contains the \D escape sequence, or if the command line contains
  the <b>-dfa</b> option, the alternative matching function is used. This
  function finds all possible matches at a given point. If, however, the \F
  escape sequence is present in the data line, it stops after the first match is
  found. This is always the shortest possible match.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DEFAULT_OUTPUT_FROM_PCRETEST"><a class="selflink" href="#DEFAULT_OUTPUT_FROM_PCRETEST">DEFAULT
  OUTPUT FROM PCRETEST</a></h1>
This section describes the output when the normal matching function,
  <b>pcre[16|32]_exec()</b>, is being used.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When a match succeeds, <b>pcretest</b> outputs the list of captured substrings
  that <b>pcre[16|32]_exec()</b> returns, starting with number 0 for the string
  that matched the whole pattern. Otherwise, it outputs &quot;No match&quot;
  when the return is PCRE_ERROR_NOMATCH, and &quot;Partial match:&quot; followed
  by the partially matching substring when <b>pcre[16|32]_exec()</b> returns
  PCRE_ERROR_PARTIAL. (Note that this is the entire substring that was inspected
  during the partial match; it may include characters before the actual match
  start if a lookbehind assertion, \K, \b, or \B was involved.) For any other
  return, <b>pcretest</b> outputs the PCRE negative error number and a short
  descriptive phrase. If the error is a failed UTF string check, the offset of
  the start of the failing character and the reason code are also output,
  provided that the size of the output vector is at least two. Here is an
  example of an interactive <b>pcretest</b> run.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 $ pcretest
<br/>
 PCRE version 8.13 2011-04-30
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 re&gt; /^abc(\d+)/
<br/>
 data&gt; abc123
<br/>

<br/>
 1: 123
<br/>
 data&gt; xyz
<br/>
 No match
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Unset capturing substrings that are not followed by one that is set are not
  returned by <b>pcre[16|32]_exec()</b>, and are not shown by <b>pcretest</b>.
  In the following example, there are two capturing substrings, but when the
  first data line is matched, the second, unset substring is not shown. An
  &quot;internal&quot; unset substring is shown as &quot;&lt;unset&gt;&quot;, as
  for the second data line.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 re&gt; /(a)|(b)/
<br/>
 data&gt; a
<br/>
 0: a
<br/>
 1: a
<br/>
 data&gt; b
<br/>
 0: b
<br/>
 1: &lt;unset&gt;
<br/>
 2: b
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If the strings contain any non-printing characters, they are output as \xhh
  escapes if the value is less than 256 and UTF mode is not set. Otherwise they
  are output as \x{hh...} escapes. See below for the definition of non-printing
  characters. If the pattern has the <b>/+</b> modifier, the output for
  substring 0 is followed by the the rest of the subject string, identified by
  &quot;0+&quot; like this:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 re&gt; /cat/+
<br/>
 data&gt; cataract
<br/>
 0: cat
<br/>
 0+ aract
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If the pattern has the <b>/g</b> or <b>/G</b> modifier, the results of
  successive matching attempts are output in sequence, like this:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 re&gt; /\Bi(\w\w)/g
<br/>
 data&gt; Mississippi
<br/>
 0: iss
<br/>
 1: ss
<br/>
 0: iss
<br/>
 1: ss
<br/>
 0: ipp
<br/>
 1: pp
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
&quot;No match&quot; is output only if the first match attempt fails. Here is an
  example of a failure message (the offset 4 that is specified by \&gt;4 is past
  the end of the subject string):
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 re&gt; /xyz/
<br/>
 data&gt; xyz\&gt;4
<br/>
 Error -24 (bad offset value)
<div class="Pp"></div>
If any of the sequences <b>\C</b>, <b>\G</b>, or <b>\L</b> are present in a data
  line that is successfully matched, the substrings extracted by the convenience
  functions are output with C, G, or L after the string number instead of a
  colon. This is in addition to the normal full list. The string length (that
  is, the return from the extraction function) is given in parentheses after
  each string for <b>\C</b> and <b>\G</b>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that whereas patterns can be continued over several lines (a plain
  &quot;&gt;&quot; prompt is used for continuations), data lines may not.
  However newlines can be included in data by means of the \n escape (or \r,
  \r\n, etc., depending on the newline sequence setting).
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OUTPUT_FROM_THE_ALTERNATIVE_MATCHING_FUNCTION"><a class="selflink" href="#OUTPUT_FROM_THE_ALTERNATIVE_MATCHING_FUNCTION">OUTPUT
  FROM THE ALTERNATIVE MATCHING FUNCTION</a></h1>
When the alternative matching function, <b>pcre[16|32]_dfa_exec()</b>, is used
  (by means of the \D escape sequence or the <b>-dfa</b> command line option),
  the output consists of a list of all the matches that start at the first point
  in the subject where there is at least one match. For example:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 re&gt; /(tang|tangerine|tan)/
<br/>
 data&gt; yellow tangerine\D
<br/>
 0: tangerine
<br/>
 1: tang
<br/>
 2: tan
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
(Using the normal matching function on this data finds only &quot;tang&quot;.)
  The longest matching string is always given first (and numbered zero). After a
  PCRE_ERROR_PARTIAL return, the output is &quot;Partial match:&quot;, followed
  by the partially matching substring. (Note that this is the entire substring
  that was inspected during the partial match; it may include characters before
  the actual match start if a lookbehind assertion, \K, \b, or \B was involved.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
If <b>/g</b> is present on the pattern, the search for further matches resumes
  at the end of the longest match. For example:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 re&gt; /(tang|tangerine|tan)/g
<br/>
 data&gt; yellow tangerine and tangy sultana\D
<br/>
 0: tangerine
<br/>
 1: tang
<br/>
 2: tan
<br/>
 0: tang
<br/>
 1: tan

Since the matching function does not support substring capture, the escape
  sequences that are concerned with captured substrings are not relevant.

  AFTER A PARTIAL MATCH</a></h1>
When the alternative matching function has given the PCRE_ERROR_PARTIAL return,
  indicating that the subject partially matched the pattern, you can restart the
  match with additional subject data by means of the \R escape sequence. For
  example:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 re&gt; /^\d?\d(jan|feb|mar|apr|may|jun|jul|aug|sep|oct|nov|dec)\d\d$/
<br/>
 data&gt; 23ja\P\D
<br/>
 Partial match: 23ja
<br/>
 data&gt; n05\R\D
<br/>
 0: n05
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
For further information about partial matching, see the <b>pcrepartial</b>
  documentation.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CALLOUTS"><a class="selflink" href="#CALLOUTS">CALLOUTS</a></h1>
If the pattern contains any callout requests, <b>pcretest</b>'s callout function
  is called during matching. This works with both matching functions. By
  default, the called function displays the callout number, the start and
  current positions in the text at the callout time, and the next pattern item
  to be tested. For example:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 ---&gt;pqrabcdef
<br/>
 0 ^ ^ \d
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This output indicates that callout number 0 occurred for a match attempt
  starting at the fourth character of the subject string, when the pointer was
  at the seventh character of the data, and when the next pattern item was \d.
  Just one circumflex is output if the start and current positions are the same.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Callouts numbered 255 are assumed to be automatic callouts, inserted as a result
  of the <b>/C</b> pattern modifier. In this case, instead of showing the
  callout number, the offset in the pattern, preceded by a plus, is output. For
  example:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 re&gt; /\d?[A-E]\*/C
<br/>
 data&gt; E*
<br/>
 ---&gt;E*
<br/>
 +0 ^ \d?
<br/>
 +3 ^ [A-E]
<br/>
 +8 ^^ \*
<br/>
 +10 ^ ^
<br/>
 0: E*
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If a pattern contains (*MARK) items, an additional line is output whenever a
  change of latest mark is passed to the callout function. For example:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 re&gt; /a(*MARK:X)bc/C
<br/>
 data&gt; abc
<br/>
 ---&gt;abc
<br/>
 +0 ^ a
<br/>
 +1 ^^ (*MARK:X)
<br/>
 +10 ^^ b
<br/>
 Latest Mark: X
<br/>
 +11 ^ ^ c
<br/>
 +12 ^ ^
<br/>
 0: abc
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The mark changes between matching &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;, but stays the
  same for the rest of the match, so nothing more is output. If, as a result of
  backtracking, the mark reverts to being unset, the text
  &quot;&lt;unset&gt;&quot; is output.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The callout function in <b>pcretest</b> returns zero (carry on matching) by
  default, but you can use a \C item in a data line (as described above) to
  change this and other parameters of the callout.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Inserting callouts can be helpful when using <b>pcretest</b> to check
  complicated regular expressions. For further information about callouts, see
  the <b>pcrecallout</b> documentation.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="NON-PRINTING_CHARACTERS"><a class="selflink" href="#NON-PRINTING_CHARACTERS">NON-PRINTING
  CHARACTERS</a></h1>
When <b>pcretest</b> is outputting text in the compiled version of a pattern,
  bytes other than 32-126 are always treated as non-printing characters are are
  therefore shown as hex escapes.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When <b>pcretest</b> is outputting text that is a matched part of a subject
  string, it behaves in the same way, unless a different locale has been set for
  the pattern (using the <b>/L</b> modifier). In this case, the <b>isprint()</b>
  function to distinguish printing and non-printing characters.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SAVING_AND_RELOADING_COMPILED_PATTERNS"><a class="selflink" href="#SAVING_AND_RELOADING_COMPILED_PATTERNS">SAVING
  AND RELOADING COMPILED PATTERNS</a></h1>
The facilities described in this section are not available when the POSIX
  interface to PCRE is being used, that is, when the <b>/P</b> pattern modifier
  is specified.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When the POSIX interface is not in use, you can cause <b>pcretest</b> to write a
  compiled pattern to a file, by following the modifiers with &gt; and a file
  name. For example:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 /pattern/im &gt;/some/file
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
See the <b>pcreprecompile</b> documentation for a discussion about saving and
  re-using compiled patterns. Note that if the pattern was successfully studied
  with JIT optimization, the JIT data cannot be saved.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The data that is written is binary. The first eight bytes are the length of the
  compiled pattern data followed by the length of the optional study data, each
  written as four bytes in big-endian order (most significant byte first). If
  there is no study data (either the pattern was not studied, or studying did
  not return any data), the second length is zero. The lengths are followed by
  an exact copy of the compiled pattern. If there is additional study data, this
  (excluding any JIT data) follows immediately after the compiled pattern. After
  writing the file, <b>pcretest</b> expects to read a new pattern.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A saved pattern can be reloaded into <b>pcretest</b> by specifying &lt; and a
  file name instead of a pattern. The name of the file must not contain a &lt;
  character, as otherwise <b>pcretest</b> will interpret the line as a pattern
  delimited by &lt; characters. For example:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 re&gt; &lt;/some/file
<br/>
 Compiled pattern loaded from /some/file
<br/>
 No study data
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If the pattern was previously studied with the JIT optimization, the JIT
  information cannot be saved and restored, and so is lost. When the pattern has
  been loaded, <b>pcretest</b> proceeds to read data lines in the usual way.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can copy a file written by <b>pcretest</b> to a different host and reload it
  there, even if the new host has opposite endianness to the one on which the
  pattern was compiled. For example, you can compile on an i86 machine and run
  on a SPARC machine. When a pattern is reloaded on a host with different
  endianness, the confirmation message is changed to:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 Compiled pattern (byte-inverted) loaded from /some/file
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The test suite contains some saved pre-compiled patterns with different
  endianness. These are reloaded using &quot;&lt;!&quot; instead of just
  &quot;&lt;&quot;. This suppresses the &quot;(byte-inverted)&quot; text so that
  the output is the same on all hosts. It also forces debugging output once the
  pattern has been reloaded.
<div class="Pp"></div>
File names for saving and reloading can be absolute or relative, but note that
  the shell facility of expanding a file name that starts with a tilde (~) is
  not available.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The ability to save and reload files in <b>pcretest</b> is intended for testing
  and experimentation. It is not intended for production use because only a
  single pattern can be written to a file. Furthermore, there is no facility for
  supplying custom character tables for use with a reloaded pattern. If the
  original pattern was compiled with custom tables, an attempt to match a
  subject string using a reloaded pattern is likely to cause <b>pcretest</b> to
  crash. Finally, if you attempt to load a file that is not in the correct
  format, the result is undefined.
