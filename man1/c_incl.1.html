<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
c_incl - determine dependencies</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
c_incl [ option... ] filename <br>
c_incl -Help <br>
c_incl -VERSion</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The c_incl program is used to traverse source files looking
for include dependencies suitable for [collect]ion or
#include-cooked-ing by cook.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The filename
&lsquo;&lsquo;-&rsquo;&rsquo; is understood to mean the
standard input. When you use this file name, caching is
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Several input languages are
supported, see the options list for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The following options are understood.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C The source file is a C source
file. It is assumed that it will have the dependencies
resolved by the cpp(1) command. The same include semantics
as the cpp(1) command <br>
will be employed. This is the default. This is short-hand
for &lsquo;&lsquo;--language=c&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--Language=name <br>
This option may be used to specify the language of the
source file. Know names include
&lsquo;&lsquo;C&rsquo;&rsquo;,
&lsquo;&lsquo;M4&rsquo;&rsquo;,
&lsquo;&lsquo;optimistic&rsquo;&rsquo; and
&lsquo;&lsquo;roff&rsquo;&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The
&lsquo;&lsquo;optimistic&rsquo;&rsquo; language will take on
almost anything. It accepts an include keyword in any case,
including mixed, with leading white space, but at most one
leading <br>
punctuation character. It assumes that the filename follows
the include keyword and does not contain white space, and
does not start or end with punctuation characters <br>
(it strips off any it may find). The rest of the line is
ignored. The drawback is that it will sometimes recognise
commands and other text as unintended include direc&acirc;
<br>
tives, hence the name. This is often used to recognise
include directives in a wide variety of assembler input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Roff The source file is a *roff
source file. It is assumed that it will have the
dependencies resolved by the roffpp(1) command. The same
include semantics as the roffpp(1) <br>
command will be employed. This is short-hand for
&lsquo;&lsquo;--language=roff&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Verbose <br>
Tell what is happening.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Ipath <br>
Specify include path, a la cc(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I- <br>
Any directories you specify with -I options before the -I-
option are searched only for the case of #include
&quot;file&quot;; they are not searched for #include
&lt;file&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If additional directories are
specified with -I options after the -I-, these directories
are searched for all #include directives. (Ordinarily all -I
directories are <br>
used this way.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition, the -I- option
inhibits the use of the current directory (where the current
input file came from) as the first search directory for
#include &quot;file&quot;. There <br>
is no way to override this effect of -I-. With -I. you can
specify searching the directory which was current when
c_incl was invoked. That is not exactly the same as <br>
what the preprocessor does by default, but it is often
satisfactory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -I- option does not inhibit
the use of the standard system directories for header files.
Thus, -I- and -No_System are independent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Absolute_Paths <br>
This option may be used to allow absolute paths in the
output. This is usually the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-No_Absolute_Paths <br>
This option may be used to exclude absolute paths from the
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Absent_Local_Ignore <br>
For files included using a #include
&rsquo;&rsquo;filename.h&rsquo;&rsquo; directive, ignore the
file if it cannot be found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Absent_Local_Mention <br>
For files included using a #include
&rsquo;&rsquo;filename.h&rsquo;&rsquo; directive, print the
file name even if the file cannot be found. This is the
default (it probably needs to be built).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Absent_Local_Error <br>
For files included using a #include
&rsquo;&rsquo;filename.h&rsquo;&rsquo; directive, print a
fatal error if the file cannot be found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Absent_System_Ignore <br>
For files included with a #include &lt;filename.h&gt;
directive, ignore the file if it cannot be found. This is
the default (it was probably ifdef&rsquo;ed out).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Absent_System_Mention <br>
For files included with a #include &lt;filename.h&gt;
directive, print the file name even if the file cannot be
found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Absent_System_Error <br>
For files included with a #include &lt;filename.h&gt;
directive, print a fatal error if the file cannot be
found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Absent_Program_Ignore <br>
If the file named on the command line cannot be found,
behave as if the file were found, but was empty.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Absent_Program_Error <br>
If the file named on the command line cannot be found, print
a fatal error message. This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Escape_Newlines <br>
This option may be used to request that newlines in the
output are escaped with backslash
(&lsquo;&lsquo;&acute;&rsquo;) characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Help <br>
Give information on how to use c_incl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-EXclude filename <br>
This option may be used to nominate include file names which
are not to be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-VERSion <br>
Tell what version of c_incl is being run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Interior_Files filename... <br>
This option may be used to tell c_incl about include files
which don&rsquo;t exist yet. This is because they are
interior to the dependency graph, but cook(1) hasn&rsquo;t
finished <br>
walking it yet. Often used with Cook&rsquo;s
[interior-files] function. (Note: the filename list has an
arbitrary number of files; it ends at the next option or
end-of-line, <br>
so you need to be careful where you put the input
filename.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-No_System <br>
Do not search the /usr/include directory. By default this is
searched last. This option implies the -No_Absolute_Paths
option, unless explicitly contradicted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-CAche <br>
This option may be used to turn caching on. This is the
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-No_Cache <br>
This option may be used to turn caching off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-PREfix string <br>
This option may be used to print a string before any of the
filenames are printed. It will not be printed if no file
names are printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Quote_FileNames <br>
This option may be used to have c_incl quote filenames. This
permits filenames to contain characters which are special to
Cook, including spaces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-SUFfix string <br>
This option may be used to print a string after all of the
filenames are printed. It will not be printed if no file
names are printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Output filename <br>
This option may be used to specify the output file. Defaults
to the standard output if not set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-No_Source_Relative_Includes
<br>
This option will give a fatal error if a #include
&rsquo;&rsquo;filename.h&rsquo;&rsquo; directive is used.
This is necessary when you are using Cook&rsquo;s
search_list functionality to stitch <br>
together a baseline and a private work area.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-RECursion <br>
This option may be used to specify that nested include files
are to be scanned, so that their includes may also be
discovered. This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-No_RECursion <br>
This option may be use to specify that nested include files
are not to be scanned. This option is recommended for use
with the Cook cascade-for recipes. This option <br>
implies -No_Cache, unless a -Cache option is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Remove_Leading_Path path <br>
This option may be used to remove path prefixes from the
included filenames. May be used more than once. This is
necessary when you are using Cook&rsquo;s search_list
func&acirc; <br>
tionality to stitch together a baseline and a private work
area; usually as &lsquo;&lsquo;[prepost &quot;-rlp=&quot;
&quot;&quot; [search_list]]&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-STripdot <br>
This option may be used to specify that leading redundant
dot directories are to be removed from paths before
processing. This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-No_STripdot <br>
This option may be used to specify that leading redundant
dot directories need not be removed from paths before
processing. (Some path flattening may still occur.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Substitute_Leading_Path from to
<br>
This option may be used to modify path prefixes from the
included filenames. May be used more than once. This is
necessary when you are performing heterogeneous builds <br>
in the same directory tree. By using an
&lsquo;&lsquo;arch&rsquo;&rsquo; variable to hold the
architecture, and placing each architecture&rsquo;s objects
in a separate directory tree, this option may <br>
be used as &lsquo;&lsquo;-slp [arch]
&quot;&rsquo;[arch]&rsquo;&quot;&rsquo;&rsquo; (The outer
quotes protect from Cook, the inner quotes protect from the
shell.) If you need more intricate editing, used sed(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any other options will generate
an error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CACHING <br>
The caching mechanism use by the c_incl program caches the
results of searching files for include files (in a file
called .c_inclrc in the current directory). The cache is
only <br>
refreshed when a file changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The use of this cache has been
shown to dramatically increase the performance of the c_incl
program. Typically, only a small proportions files in a
project change between <br>
builds, resulting in a very high cache hit rate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When using caching, always use
the same command line options, otherwise weird and wonderful
things will happen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The .c_inclrc file is a binary
file. If you wish to rebuild the cache, simply delete this
file with the rm(1) command. Being a binary file, the
.c_inclrc file is not portable <br>
across machines or operating systems, so you will need to
delete it when you move your sources. It is a binary file
for performance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Accesses to the .c_inclrc file
use file locking, so recipies using c_incl need not use the
single-thread clause.</p>
