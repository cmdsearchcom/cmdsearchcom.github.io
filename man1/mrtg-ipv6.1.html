mrtg-ipv6 - IPv6 support in MRTG
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OVERVIEW"><a class="selflink" href="#OVERVIEW">OVERVIEW</a></h1>
MRTG and cfgmaker support SNMP over IPv6. IPv6 targets can be specified by
  hostname or IPv6 address, and if the required libraries are present (see
  below), queries will use IPv6.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="USAGE"><a class="selflink" href="#USAGE">USAGE</a></h1>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Enabling_IPv6"><a class="selflink" href="#Enabling_IPv6">Enabling
  IPv6</a></h2>
IPv6 is currently disabled by default and must be explicitly enabled. In MRTG
  this is done by turning on the <b>EnableIPv6</b> global option in the
  configuration file. In cfgmaker, it is enabled with the <b>--enable-ipv6</b>
  command-line option.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If IPv6 is disabled, MRTG and cfgmaker should behave in exactly the same way as
  previous versions. So the addition of IPv6 support should have no effect on
  existing MRTG setups unless IPv6 is enabled.
<div class="Pp"></div>
IPv6 support requires the Socket6 and INET6 libraries (see below). If MRTG can't
  find them, IPv6 is disabled.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Specifying_IPv6_targets"><a class="selflink" href="#Specifying_IPv6_targets">Specifying
  IPv6 targets</a></h2>
IPv6 targets may be specified by name or IPv6 address. Numeric IPv6 addresses
  may be used with both cfgmaker and MRTG, but they must be enclosed in square
  brackets.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For example, a target could be specified as:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 public@[2001:760:4::]:161
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Hostnames work as expected: first an IPv6 name lookup is tried, then an IPv4
  lookup.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Targets_that_do_not_support_SNMP_over_IPv6"><a class="selflink" href="#Targets_that_do_not_support_SNMP_over_IPv6">Targets
  that do not support SNMP over IPv6</a></h2>
Many targets (this currently includes all Cisco routers) do not yet support SNMP
  over IPv6 and must be monitored over IPv4. This can cause problems if you
  specify a target through its DNS name and the name maps to both the IPv6
  address and the IPv4 address of the target: MRTG will only try IPv6, and will
  fail.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To query these targets, use the <b>IPv4Only</b> per-target option, which tells
  MRTG not to use SNMP over IPv6 for the target.
<div class="Pp"></div>
MRTG does not fall back to IPv4 for performance and correctness reasons. If
  there are many routers to query, a timeout for every router would make MRTG
  take too long to query them all. And if, for some reason, IPv6 connectivity to
  the target is lost, MRTG's error messages can help figure out what is wrong.
<div class="Pp"></div>
cfgmaker does fall back from IPv6 to IPv4. If IPv6 is enabled and cfgmaker is
  given a hostname that resolves to both an IPv6 and an IPv4 address, it first
  tries to query the target over IPv6. If it receives no answer, it tries again
  using IPv4. If the target answers, cfgmaker sets the IPv4Only option in the
  generated config file.

  LIBRARIES</a></h1>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Libraries_required"><a class="selflink" href="#Libraries_required">Libraries

IPv6 support requires the <b>Socket6</b> and <b>INET6</b> Perl modules. Both can
  be downloaded from CPAN:
<div class="Pp"></div>
http://search.cpan.org/author/UMEMOTO/Socket6/
<div class="Pp"></div>
http://search.cpan.org/author/MONDEJAR/INET6/
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you use Debian, you will need the packages <b>libsocket6-perl</b> and
  <b>libio-socket-inet6-perl</b>, which are (or should soon be) in unstable.
<div class="Pp"></div>
So far, IPv6 support has been tested on Linux only, and only with Socket6
  version 0.12. Also note that IPv6 won't work at all if you don't have INET6.pm
  version 2.00 or newer.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Installing_the_libraries"><a class="selflink" href="#Installing_the_libraries">Installing
  the libraries</a></h2>
Building and installing Socket6 and INET6 is very simple. For each module, just
  unpack the archive and then do:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 perl Makefile.PL
 make
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
and then:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 su
 make install
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you have installed the libraries successfully, cfgmaker and mrtg should
  automatically detect them and allow IPv6 support to be enabled.
