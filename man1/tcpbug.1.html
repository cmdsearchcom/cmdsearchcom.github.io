<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
tcpbug - TCP/IP connection bugging device</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
tcpbug [-cx] [-btT] local-port remote-host remote-port</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
tcpbug forwards a TCP/IP connection to port local-port on
the local machine to the port remote-port on remote-host
while spying on the connection and writing all data passing
<br>
through to standard output. All data coming from the client
is printed with a greater than sign (&gt;) first on each
line, and all data coming from the server is printed with a
<br>
less than sign (&lt;) first on each line. Any byte offsets
and time-stamps are printed before the greater than or less
than sign, and are separated from each other by a colon
(:).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-b Print the offset of the first byte in the stream for each
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Display bytes as individual
characters. Printable characters are displayed directly,
some control characters appear, et.c), while others as
C-language escapes (0 <br>
appear as 3-digit octal numbers. This should be similar to
the -c switch of od(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Print the time at which the
data was received for each line. The time is the number of
seconds and microseconds, separated by a decimal point (.),
since 00:00 UTC, Janu&acirc; <br>
ary 1, 1970, as reported by gettimeofday().</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T Print the time at which the
data was received for each line. The time is the number of
seconds and microseconds, separated by a decimal point (.),
since the connections <br>
were established.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x Display each byte as a two
digit hexadecimal number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
tcpconnect(1), tcplisten(1), od(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
The names of the options are not yet finalized, and may
change at a future release.</p>
