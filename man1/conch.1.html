<p>CONCH(1) BSD General Commands Manual CONCH(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
conch &acirc; Conch SSH client</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
conch [-AaCfINnrsTtVvx] [-c cipher_spec] [-e escape_char]
[-i identity_file] [-K connection_spec] [-L
port:host:hostport] [-l user] [-m mac_spec] [-o
openssh_option] [-p port] <br>
[-R port:host:hostport] [user@] hostname [command]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
conch is a SSHv2 client for logging into a remote machine
and executing commands. It provides encrypted and secure
communications across a possibly insecure network. Arbitrary
<br>
TCP/IP ports can also be forwarded over the secure
connection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">conch connects and logs into
hostname (as user or the current username). The user must
prove her/his identity through a public-key or a password.
Alternatively, if a connection <br>
is already open to a server, a new shell can be opened over
the connection without having to reauthenticate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If command is specified, command
is executed instead of a shell. If the -s option is given,
command is treated as an SSHv2 subsystem name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Authentication <br>
Conch supports the public-key, keyboard-interactive, and
password authentications.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The public-key method allows the
RSA or DSA algorithm to be used. The client uses his/her
private key, $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa or $HOME/.ssh/id_dsa to sign
the session identifier, known <br>
only by the client and server. The server checks that the
matching public key is valid for the user, and that the
signature is correct.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If public-key authentication
fails, conch can authenticate by sending an encrypted
password over the connection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Connection sharing <br>
conch has the ability to multiplex multiple shells, commands
and TCP/IP ports over the same secure connection. To disable
multiplexing for a connection, use the -I flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -K option determines how the
client connects to the remote host. It is a comma-separated
list of the methods to use, in order of preference. The two
connection methods are <br>
&acirc;unix&acirc; (for connecting over a multiplexed
connection) and &acirc;direct&acirc; (to connect directly).
To disable connecting over a multiplexed connection, do not
include &acirc;unix&acirc; in the prefer&acirc; <br>
ence list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As an example of how connection
sharing works, to speed up CVS over SSH:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">conch --noshell --fork -l
cvs_user cvs_host <br>
set CVS_RSH=conch</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Now, when CVS connects to
cvs_host as cvs_user, instead of making a new connection to
the server, conch will add a new channel to the existing
connection. This saves the cost of <br>
repeatedly negotiating the cryptography and
authentication.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The options are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A Enables authentication agent
forwarding.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a Disables authentication agent
forwarding (default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C Enable compression.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c cipher_spec <br>
Selects encryption algorithms to be used for this
connection, as a comma-separated list of ciphers in order of
preference. The list that conch supports is (in order of
<br>
default preference): aes256-ctr, aes256-cbc, aes192-ctr,
aes192-cbc, aes128-ctr, aes128-cbc, cast128-ctr,
cast128-cbc, blowfish-ctr, blowfish, idea-ctr, idea-cbc,
3des-ctr, <br>
3des-cbc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e ch | ^ch | none <br>
Sets the escape character for sessions with a PTY (default:
&acirc;~&acirc;). The escape character is only recognized at
the beginning of a line (after a newline). The escape
charac&acirc; <br>
ter followed by a dot (&acirc;.&acirc;) closes the
connection; followed by ^Z suspends the connection; and
followed by the escape character sends the escape character
once. Setting <br>
the character to &acirc;none&acirc; disables any
escapes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Fork to background after
authentication.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I Do not allow connection
sharing over this connection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i identity_spec <br>
The file from which the identity (private key) for RSA or
DSA authentication is read. The defaults are
$HOME/.ssh/id_rsa and $HOME/.ssh/id_dsa. It is possible to
use this <br>
option more than once to use more than one private key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-K connection_spec <br>
Selects methods for connection to the server, as a
comma-separated list of methods in order of preference. See
Connection sharing for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L port:host:hostport <br>
Specifies that the given port on the client host is to be
forwarded to the given host and port on the remote side.
This allocates a socket to listen to port on the local <br>
side, and when connections are made to that socket, they are
forwarded over the secure channel and a connection is made
to host port hostport from the remote machine. Only <br>
root can forward privieged ports.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l user <br>
Log in using this username.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m mac_spec <br>
Selects MAC (message authentication code) algorithms, as a
comma-separated list in order of preference. The list that
conch supports is (in order of preference): hmac- <br>
sha2-512, hmac-sha2-256, hmac-sha1, hmac-md5.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N Do not execute a shell or
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Redirect input from
/dev/null.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o openssh_option <br>
Ignored OpenSSH options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p port <br>
The port to connect to on the server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R port:host:hostport <br>
Specifies that the given port on the remote host is to be
forwarded to the given host and port on the local side. This
allocates a socket to listen to port on the remote <br>
side, and when connections are made to that socket, they are
forwarded over the secure channel and a connection is made
to host port hostport from the client host. Only <br>
root can forward privieged ports.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Reconnect to the server if
the connection is lost.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Invoke command (mandatory) as
a SSHv2 subsystem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T Do not allocate a TTY.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Allocate a TTY even if
command is given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Display version number
only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Log to stderr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x Disable X11 connection
forwarding (default).</p>
