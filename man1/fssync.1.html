<p>FSSYNC(1) FSSYNC(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
fssync - File system synchronization tool (1-way, over
SSH)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
fssync -d db -r root [option...] host</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
fssync is a 1-way file-synchronization tool that tracks
inodes and maintains a local database of files that are on
the remote side, making it able to:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; handle
efficiently a huge number of dirs/files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; detect
renames/moves and hard-links</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It aims at minimizing network
traffic and synchronizing every detail of a file system:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; all types of
inode: file, dir, block/character/fifo, socket, symlink</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; preserve hard
links</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; modification
time, ownership/permission/ACL, extended attributes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; sparse files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other features:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; it can be
configured to exclude files from synchronization</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; fssync can be
interrupted and resumed at any time, making it tolerant to
random failures (e.g. network error)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; algorithm to
synchronize file content is designed to handle big files
like VM images efficiently, by updating fixed-size modified
blocks in-place</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Main usage of fssync is to
prevent data loss in case of hardware failure, where RAID1
is not possible (e.g. in laptops).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On Btrfs [1] file systems,
fssync is an useful alternative to btrfs send (and receive)
commands, thanks to filtering capabilities. This can be
combined with Btrfs snapshotting at <br>
destination side for a full backup solution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USAGE <br>
Use fssync --help to get the complete list of options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The most important thing to
remember is that the local database must match exactly
what&rsquo;s on the destination host:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Files that are
copied on the destination host must not be modified. And
nothing should be manually created inside destination
directories. If you still want to access data on <br>
remote host, you should do it through a read-only bind
mounts (requires Linux &gt;= 2.6.26).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; You must have 1
database per destination, if you plan to have several copies
of the same source directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Look at -c option if you wonder
whether your database matches the destination directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">First run of fssync:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The easiest way
is to let fssync do everything. Specify a non-existing file
path to -d option and a empty or non-existing destination
directory (see -R option). fssync will <br>
automatically creates the database and copy all dirs/files
to remote host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A faster way may
be to do the initial copy by other means, like a raw copy of
a partition. If you&rsquo;re absolutely sure the source and
destination are exactly the same, you can <br>
initialize the database by specifying - as host. If inode
numbers are the same on both sides, which is the case if
data were copied at block level, you can modify the source
<br>
partition while you are initializing the DB on the
destination one, and get back the DB locally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An example of wrapper around
fssync, with a filter, can be found at
examples/fssync_home</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fssync does never descend
directories on other filesystems. Inodes masked by mount
points are also skipped, so they should be unmounted
temporarily if you want them to be syn&acirc; <br>
chronized. The same result can be achieved by synchronizing
from a bind mount.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See also the NONE cipher
switching [3] patch if you don&rsquo;t need encryption and
you want to speed up your SSH connection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOW IT WORKS <br>
fssync maintains a single SQLite table of all dirs/files
that are on the remote side. Each row matches a path, with
its inode (on local side), other metadata (on remote side)
and <br>
a checked flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When running, fssync iterates
recursively through all local dirs/files and for each path
that is not ignored (see -f option), it queries the DB to
decide what to do. If already <br>
checked, path is skipped immediately. When a path is
synchronized, it is marked as checked. At the end, all rows
that are not checked corresponds to paths that don&rsquo;t
exist any&acirc; <br>
more. Once they are deleted on the remote side, all checked
flags are reset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Failure tolerance <br>
In fact, fssync doesn&rsquo;t require that the database
matches perfectly the destination. It tolerates some
differences in order to recover any interrupted
synchronization caused by a <br>
network failure, a file operation error, or anything other
than an operating system crash of the local host (or
something similar like a power failure).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In most cases, this is done by
the remote host, which automatically create (or overwrite)
an inode of the expected type if necessary. The only
exception is that the remote will <br>
never delete a non-empty directory on its own. For most
complex cases, fssync journalizes the operation in the
database: in case of failure, fssync will be able to recover
on <br>
next sync.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Race conditions <br>
A race condition means that other processes on the local
host are modifying inodes that fssync is synchronizing.
fssync handles any kind of race condition. In fact, fssync
has <br>
nothing to do for most cases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a race condition happens,
fssync does not guarantee that the remote data is in a
consistent state. Each sync always fixes existing
inconsistencies but may introduces others, <br>
so fssync is not suitable for hot backuping of
databases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With Btrfs, you can get
consistency by snapshotting at source side.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIMILAR PROJECTS <br>
The idea of maintaining a local database actually comes from
csync2 [4]. I was about to adopt it when I realized that I
really needed a tool that always detects renames/moves of
<br>
big files. That&rsquo;s why I see fssync as a partial
rewrite of csync2, with inode tracking and without
bidirectional synchronization. The local database really
makes fssync &amp; csync2 <br>
faster than the well-known rsync [5].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
sqlite3(1), ssh(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS/LIMITATIONS/TODO <br>
1. For performance reasons, the SQLite database is never
flushed to disk while fssync is running. Which means that if
the operating system crashes, the DB might become corrupted,
<br>
and even if it isn&rsquo;t, it may not reflect anymore the
status of the remote host and later runs may fail (for
example, fssync refuses to replace a non-empty folder it
doesn&rsquo;t <br>
know by a non-folder). So in any case, it is advised to
rebuild the DB.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the DB is not corrupted and
you don&rsquo;t want to rebuild it, you can try to update it
by running fssync again as soon as possible, so that the
same changes are replayed. <br>
fssync should be able to detect that all remote operations
are already performed. See also -c and -F options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. fssync should not trash the
page cache by using posix_fadvise(2). Unfortunately, Linux
does not implement POSIX_FADV_NOREUSE yet (see
https://lkml.org/lkml/2011/6/24/136 for <br>
more information). We could do like Bup [2], which uses
information returned by mincore(2) in order to eject pages
after save more selectively [6].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. fssync process on remote side
might leave parent directories with wrong permissions or
modification times if it is terminated during specific
operation like recovery (at the <br>
very beginning), cleanup (at the end), rename (if a
directory is moved). That is, all operations that need to
temporarily alter a directory that is not being checked.
&quot;Wont&acirc; <br>
fix&quot; for now, because it is unlikely to happen and any
solution would be quite heavy, for little benefit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. What is not synchronized:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; access &amp;
change times: I won&rsquo;t implement it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; inode flags (see
chattr(1) and lsattr(1)): some flags like C or c are
important on Btrfs so this could be a nice improvement, at
least if it was implemented partially.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; file-system
specific properties ?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5. Add 2 options to map specific
users or groups. You may want this if you get permission
errors and this is certainly a better solution than an
option not to preserve ownership. <br>
Currently, on destination host, you must either run fssync
as root, or configure security so that it is allowed to
change ownership with same uid/gid than on source (or with
<br>
same user/group names if --map-users option is given).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6. Don&rsquo;t rely on
permissions settings to prevent access to inodes on
destination side. This is because metadata are synchronized
after data (in the case of a directory, it means <br>
all inodes under this directory is synchronized before its
metadata) and in some cases, an attacker could access to
sensitive data while fssync is running. Access should be
<br>
denied on a parent directory of your destination tree (or at
the root of this tree if you&rsquo;re careful enough to keep
it secure on source side).</p>
