fssync is a 1-way file-synchronization tool that tracks inodes and maintains a
  local database of files that are on the remote side, making it able to:

Main usage of fssync is to prevent data loss in case of hardware failure, where
  RAID1 is not possible (e.g. in laptops).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
On <i>Btrfs</i> [1] file systems, fssync is an useful alternative to <i>btrfs
  send</i> (and <i>receive</i>) commands, thanks to filtering capabilities. This
  can be combined with Btrfs snapshotting at destination side for a full backup
  solution.

<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The most important thing to remember is that the local database must match
  exactly what's on the destination host:
<div style="margin-left: 0.00ex;">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Files that are copied on the destination host must not be
      modified. And nothing should be manually created inside destination
      directories. If you still want to access data on remote host, you should
      do it through a read-only bind mounts (requires Linux &gt;= 2.6.26).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">You must have 1 database per destination, if you plan to
      have several copies of the same source directory.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Look at <b>-c</b> option if you wonder whether your database matches the
  destination directory.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
First run of fssync:
<div style="margin-left: 0.00ex;">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The easiest way is to let fssync do everything. Specify a
      non-existing file path to <b>-d</b> option and a empty or non-existing
      destination directory (see <b>-R</b> option). fssync will automatically
      creates the database and copy all dirs/files to remote host.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">A faster way may be to do the initial copy by other means,
      like a raw copy of a partition. If you're absolutely sure the source and
      destination are exactly the same, you can initialize the database by
      specifying <b>-</b> as host. If inode numbers are the same on both sides,
      which is the case if data were copied at block level, you can modify the
      source partition while you are initializing the DB on the destination one,
      and get back the DB locally.</dd>
</dl>

An example of wrapper around fssync, with a filter, can be found at
  <i>examples/fssync_home</i>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
fssync does never descend directories on other filesystems. Inodes masked by
  mount points are also skipped, so they should be unmounted temporarily if you
  want them to be synchronized. The same result can be achieved by synchronizing
  from a bind mount.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
See also the <i>NONE cipher switching</i> [3] patch if you don't need encryption
  and you want to speed up your SSH connection.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="HOW_IT_WORKS"><a class="selflink" href="#HOW_IT_WORKS">HOW
  IT WORKS</a></h1>
fssync maintains a single SQLite table of all dirs/files that are on the remote
  side. Each row matches a path, with its inode (on local side), other metadata
  (on remote side) and a <i>checked</i> flag.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
When running, fssync iterates recursively through all local dirs/files and for
  each path that is not ignored (see <b>-f</b> option), it queries the DB to
  decide what to do. If already <i>checked</i>, path is skipped immediately.
  When a path is synchronized, it is marked as <i>checked</i>. At the end, all
  rows that are not <i>checked</i> corresponds to paths that don't exist
  anymore. Once they are deleted on the remote side, all <i>checked</i> flags
  are reset.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Failure_tolerance"><a class="selflink" href="#Failure_tolerance">Failure
  tolerance</a></h2>
In fact, fssync doesn't require that the database matches perfectly the
  destination. It tolerates some differences in order to recover any interrupted
  synchronization caused by a network failure, a file operation error, or
  anything other than an operating system crash of the local host (or something
  similar like a power failure).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
In most cases, this is done by the remote host, which automatically create (or
  overwrite) an inode of the expected type if necessary. The only exception is
  that the remote will never delete a non-empty directory on its own. For most
  complex cases, fssync journalizes the operation in the database: in case of
  failure, fssync will be able to recover on next sync.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Race_conditions"><a class="selflink" href="#Race_conditions">Race
  conditions</a></h2>
A race condition means that other processes on the local host are modifying
  inodes that fssync is synchronizing. fssync handles any kind of race
  condition. In fact, fssync has nothing to do for most cases.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
When a race condition happens, fssync does not guarantee that the remote data is
  in a consistent state. Each sync always fixes existing inconsistencies but may
  introduces others, so fssync is not suitable for hot backuping of databases.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
With Btrfs, you can get consistency by snapshotting at source side.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SIMILAR_PROJECTS"><a class="selflink" href="#SIMILAR_PROJECTS">SIMILAR
  PROJECTS</a></h1>
The idea of maintaining a local database actually comes from <i>csync2</i> [4].
  I was about to adopt it when I realized that I really needed a tool that
  always detects renames/moves of big files. That's why I see fssync as a
  partial rewrite of csync2, with inode tracking and without bidirectional
  synchronization. The local database really makes fssync &amp; csync2 faster
  than the well-known <i>rsync</i> [5].

<dl class="Bl-tag">

  <dd class="It-tag">For performance reasons, the SQLite database is never
      flushed to disk while fssync is running. Which means that if the operating
      system crashes, the DB might become corrupted, and even if it isn't, it
      may not reflect anymore the status of the remote host and later runs may
      fail (for example, fssync refuses to replace a non-empty folder it doesn't
      know by a non-folder). So in any case, it is advised to rebuild the DB.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If the DB is not corrupted and you don't want to rebuild it, you can try to
      update it by running fssync again as soon as possible, so that the same
      changes are replayed. fssync should be able to detect that all remote
      operations are already performed. See also <b>-c</b> and <b>-F</b>
      options.</dd>
