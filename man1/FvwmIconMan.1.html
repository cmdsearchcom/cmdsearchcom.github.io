<p>FvwmIconMan(1) Fvwm Modules FvwmIconMan(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
FvwmIconMan - an fvwm icon manager</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
FvwmIconMan is spawned by fvwm, so no command line
invocation will work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
FvwmIconMan is an icon manager modeled after the TWM icon
manager. The user may have multiple icon managers, each of
which armed with a list of window types which it manages.
<br>
For example, the user may have one manager which lists only
emacs windows, and another which lists everything else. You
may also specify what resolution each icon manager uses,
<br>
for example, one icon manager may manage windows on all
desks, and another may manage only those on the current
desk, page or screen. FvwmIconMan can display the miniature
icons <br>
provided by fvwm for its managed windows. The managers may
have a maximum number of columns (and so grows vertically),
a maximum number of rows (and then grows horizontally), or
<br>
stay at a fixed size, and adjust the size of the window
buttons to fit (think win95&rsquo;s Taskbar). And when
support is compiled in for the X Shape extension, then the
manager win&acirc; <br>
dows may be shaped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can specify actions to be
run when mouse, or key events are received. For example, you
could bind the first mouse button to iconify the selected
window, and make bindings for <br>
the arrow keys to navigate the manager window without the
mouse.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FvwmIconMan can be set to
display which window currently has the keyboard focus, and
by binding the select event (see below) to the fvwm Focus
function, you can emulate the TWM <br>
icon manager&rsquo;s behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INITIALIZATION <br>
During initialization, FvwmIconMan searches though the fvwm
configuration file for the options which are described
below. It is highly recommended that you make FvwmIconMan be
a <br>
sticky window. And if you want to make use of the
followfocus option, and/or binding an action to Focus, then
you should make FvwmIconMan clicktofocus. Also, when using
the Shape <br>
option, it&rsquo;s recommended that the FvwmIconMan window
not be decorated at all by fvwm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INVOCATION <br>
FvwmIconMan can be invoked by inserting the line
&rsquo;Module FvwmIconMan&rsquo; in the .fvwm2rc file. If
FvwmIconMan is to be spawned during fvwm&rsquo;s
initialization, then this line should <br>
be placed in the StartFunction declarations, or it can be
bound to a menu, mouse button, or keystroke to invoke it
later.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you wish to run FvwmIconMan
in a transient mode, such as with the built in window list,
then pass &quot;-Transient&quot; as an argument. The
invocation &quot;Module FvwmIconMan -Transient&quot; <br>
will do nicely. In this mode, FvwmIconMan will pop up one
manager window directly under the cursor. When the mouse
button is released, it will execute the appropriate action,
and <br>
then exit. Things are somewhat complicated by the fact that
you can specify that FvwmIconMan creates multiple manager
windows, behavior which is unsuitable when running
tran&acirc; <br>
siently. So, when running transiently, FvwmIconMan will only
create one manager window. Use the manager id
&rsquo;transient&rsquo; to specify options for this manager
window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FvwmIconMan may accept an alias
name as an argument. For example, &quot;Module FvwmIconMan
FvwmIconMan-Variant2&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION OPTIONS REFERENCE
CHART <br>
FvwmIconMan has acquired quite a few options. I assume
others share my dislike of paging though a long man page, so
here is a terse reference chart describing the available
<br>
options. They are described in more detail in the next
section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION OPTIONS <br>
With the exception of the nummanagers option, all of the
options may be defined on a per-manager basis. So, for
example, the user may have his emacs manager with a red
fore&acirc; <br>
ground, and his xterm manager with a blue one. A
configuration line may therefore have one of two forms:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmIconMan: OptionName
OptionValue <br>
To specify that the OptionName takes the value OptionValue
for all managers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmIconMan: ManagerId
OptionName OptionValue <br>
To specify that the option OptionName takes the value
OptionValue for manager ManagerId. ManagerId may either be a
positive integer, or the string &quot;transient&quot;. An
integer <br>
id refers to managers which FvwmIconMan creates when running
normally, and an id of &quot;transient&quot; refers to the
single manager which FvwmIconMan creates when running
tran&acirc; <br>
siently.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The old syntax, that uses an
asterisk instead of white spaces before ManagerId and
OptionName, is supported too, but it is obsolete now.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options may be
specified:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmIconMan: NumManagers num
<br>
num is a positive integer specifying the total number of
icon managers. Since FvwmIconMan would like to know how many
managers there are before handling any manager spe&acirc;
<br>
cific options, this should come first. The default is 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmIconMan: [id] Action type
binding <br>
Binds an FvwmIconMan command to an event. Type may be one of
the values: Key, Mouse, or Select. Actions are described in
the following section ACTIONS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmIconMan: [id] Background
background <br>
Specifies the default background color.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmIconMan: [id]
ButtonGeometry geometry <br>
Specifies the initial geometry of an individual button in
pixels. If the specified height is 0, then the button height
is determined from the font size. X and Y coordi&acirc; <br>
nates are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmIconMan: [id] Colorset
colorset <br>
The default colorset used. Overrides background and
foreground.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmIconMan: [id] DrawIcons
value <br>
If your version of fvwm is capable of using mini icons, then
this option determines if FvwmIconMan displays the mini
icons. Otherwise, it generates an error message. <br>
&quot;true&quot; means that mini icons are shown for
iconified windows, &quot;false&quot; that mini icons are
never shown, and &quot;always&quot; that mini icons are
shown for all windows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmIconMan: [id]
FocusAndSelectButton style [forecolor backcolor] <br>
Same as the plainbutton option, but specifies the look of
buttons which are both selected, and have the keyboard
focus.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmIconMan: [id]
FocusAndSelectColorset colorset <br>
Works like focusandselectbutton but uses colorsets instead.
The style setting can still only be applied with
focusandselectbutton.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmIconMan: [id] FocusButton
style [forecolor backcolor] <br>
Same as the plainbutton option, but specifies the look of
buttons whose windows have the keyboard focus.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmIconMan: [id] FocusColorset
colorset <br>
Works like focusbutton but uses colorsets instead. The style
setting can still only be applied with focusbutton.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmIconMan: [id] FollowFocus
boolean <br>
If true, then the button appearance reflects which window
currently has focus. Default is false.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmIconMan: [id] Font font
<br>
Specifies the font to be used for labeling the buttons. The
default is 8x13.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmIconMan: [id] Foreground
foreground <br>
Specifies the default foreground color.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmIconMan: [id] Format
formatstring <br>
A printf like format string which describes the string to be
printed in the manager window for each managed window.
Possible flags are: %t, %i, %c, and %r for the
window&rsquo;s <br>
title, icon title, class, or resource name, respectively.
The default is &quot;%c: %i&quot;. Warning: m4 reserves the
word format, so if you use m4, take appropriate action.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmIconMan: [id] IconName
iconstring <br>
Specifies the window icon name for that manager window.
Iconstring may either be a single word, or a string enclosed
in quotes. The default is &quot;FvwmIconMan&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmIconMan: [id]
IconAndSelectButton style [forecolor backcolor] <br>
Same as the plainbutton option, but specifies the look of
buttons whose windows are iconified and the button is
selected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmIconMan: [id] IconButton
style [forecolor backcolor] <br>
Same as the plainbutton option, but specifies the look of
buttons whose windows are iconified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmIconMan: [id]
IconAndSelectColorset colorset <br>
Works like IconAndSelectButton but uses colorsets instead.
The style setting can still only be applied with
iconbutton.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmIconMan: [id] IconColorset
colorset <br>
Works like iconbutton but uses colorsets instead. The style
setting can still only be applied with iconbutton.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmIconMan: [id]
ManagerGeometry geometry <br>
Specifies the initial geometry of the manager, in units of
buttons. If height is 0, then the manager will use width
columns, and will grow vertically once it has more than <br>
width windows. Likewise, if width is 0, it will use height
rows, and grow horizontally. If both are nonzero, then the
manager window will be exactly that size, and stay <br>
that way. As columns are created, the buttons will narrow to
accommodate. If the geometry is specified with a negative y
coordinate, then the window manager will grow <br>
upwards. Otherwise, it will grow downwards.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmIconMan: [id]
MaxButtonWidth width <br>
Defines a maximum for the width of a button (in pixels). By
default there is no maximum. A value of 0 resets the
default. The maximum is only used with a non growing
man&acirc; <br>
ager (the ManagerGeometry option specifies non zero width
and height).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmIconMan: [id]
MaxButtonWidthByColumns col <br>
This is another way to set the button width. col is the
number of columns of icons. The button width is determined
by dividing the total width of FvwmIconMan by the num&acirc;
<br>
ber of columns. For example if the width of FvwmIconMan
manager is 1024, MaxButtonWidthByColumns is 4 then
MaxButtonWidth is 256. This is useful when you do not know,
at <br>
config time, the width of the manager, for example, for a
swallowed FvwmIconMan.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmIconMan: [id] NoIconAction
action <br>
Tells FvwmIconMan to do action when a NoIcon style window is
iconified or de-iconified. Relevant coordinates are appended
to action so that the icon can be traced to an <br>
FvwmIconMan button. An example action is
&quot;*FvwwmIconMan: NoIconAction SendToModule FvwmAnimate
animate&quot;. A blank or null action turns this feature
off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmIconMan: [id] PlainButton
style [forecolor backcolor] <br>
Specifies how normal buttons look. style may be one of flat,
up, down, raisededge, or sunkedge, and describes how the
button is drawn. The color options are both optional, <br>
and if not set, then the default colors are used. If on a
monochrome screen, then the style option is ignored, but
must still be set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmIconMan: [id] PlainColorset
colorset <br>
Works like plainbutton but uses colorsets instead. The style
setting can still only be applied with plainbutton.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmIconMan: [id]
ReliefThickness num <br>
num is an integer specifying the number of pixels thick that
the relief at the edge of non-flat buttons should be.
Setting this to 0 will produce flat buttons, as if the <br>
values for FocusAndSelectButton, FocusButton,
IconAndSelectButton, IconButton, PlainButton, SelectButton,
and TitleButton were all set to flat. If num is negative,
the <br>
button will be inverted as if you had used Reverse for all
classes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmIconMan: [id] Resolution
resolution <br>
Specifies when the manager will display an entry for a
certain window. resolution may take one of the following
values: global, desk, page, screen, !desk, !page, or <br>
!screen. If global, then all windows of the appropriate type
(see the show and dontshow options below) will be shown. If
desk, then only those windows on the current desk <br>
are shown. If page, then only those windows on the current
page are shown. If screen, then only those windows on the
current Xinerama screen are shown. !desk reverses the <br>
sense of desk, displaying only those windows not on the
current desk. Likewise, !page shows only those windows not
on the current page and !screen shows only those windows
<br>
not on the current Xinerama screen. The default is page. If
Xinerama is not active or only a single screen is used, page
and screen are equivalent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This configuration line is
respected when FvwmIconMan is running as well, the
resolution is changed dynamically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmIconMan: [id] Reverse class
<br>
Causes certain classes of buttons to have their relief lines
reversed so that up and down styles are reversed. This has
no affect on flat buttons. The class can be icon, <br>
normal or none. The default is none.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmIconMan: [id] SelectButton
style [forecolor backcolor] <br>
Same as the plainbutton option, but specifies the look of
buttons when the mouse is over them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmIconMan: [id]
SelectColorset colorset <br>
Works like selectbutton but uses colorsets instead. The
style setting can still only be applied with
selectbutton.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmIconMan: [id] Shape boolean
<br>
If True, then use make the window shaped. Probably only
useful if you have multiple columns or rows. If FvwmIconMan
wasn&rsquo;t compiled to support the Shape extension, this
<br>
generates an error message. When using shaped windows,
it&rsquo;s recommended that a fvwm style is made for
FvwmIconMan that has no borders. Otherwise, fvwm will get
confused.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmIconMan: [id] Sort value
<br>
If name, then the manager list is sorted by name. If
namewithcase, then it is sorted by name sensitive to case.
If id, then the manager list is sorted by the window id,
<br>
which never changes after the window is created. If
weighted, then the manager list is sorted by weight (see the
description of sortweight below). Or it can be set to <br>
none, which results in no sorting. Default is name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmIconMan: [id] SortWeight
weight pattern-list <br>
Assigns the specified weight to windows that match
pattern-list. The list is made up of patterns of the form
type=pattern, where type is one of class, resource, title,
or <br>
icon, and pattern is an expression of the same format used
in the fvwm style command (minimalistic shell pattern
matching). Multiple sort weights can be given. Each
win&acirc; <br>
dow is matched against the list of sort weights, in order,
and is given the weight from the first match. Lower-weighted
windows are placed first in the manager list. For <br>
example: <br>
*FvwmIconMan: Sort weighted <br>
*FvwmIconMan: SortWeight 1 class=XTerm title=special* <br>
*FvwmIconMan: SortWeight 10 class=XTerm <br>
*FvwmIconMan: SortWeight 5 <br>
In this example, xterm windows whose titles start with
&quot;special&quot; (weight 1) are listed first, followed by
everything but other xterms (weight 5), and the other xterms
<br>
(weight 10) are listed last. If no default weight (empty
pattern list) is given, the default weight is 0. Only
relevant if the sort type is set to weighted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmIconMan: [id] Title
title-string <br>
Specifies the window title string for that manager window.
Titlestring may either be a single word, or a string
enclosed in quotes. The default is &quot;FvwmIconMan&quot;.
This will <br>
be drawn in the title bar of the manager window, if any, and
in the title button, which is the button drawn when the
manager is empty.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmIconMan: [id] TitleButton
style [forecolor backcolor] <br>
Same as the plainbutton option, but specifies the look of
the title button (the button drawn when the manager is
empty). The manager&rsquo;s title is drawn in the title
button.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmIconMan: [id] UseWinList
boolean <br>
If true, then honor the WinListSkip style flag. Otherwise,
all windows are subject to possible management according to
the show and dontshow lists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The two following options
control which windows get handled by which managers. A
manager can get two lists, one of windows to show, and one
of windows to ignore. If only the show <br>
list is given, then that manager will show only the windows
in the list. If only the DontShow list is given, then the
manager will show all windows except those in the list. If
<br>
both lists are given, then a window will be shown if it is
not in the DontShow list, and in the Show list. And finally,
if neither list is given, then the manager will handle all
<br>
windows. Each list is made up of patterns of the form
type=pattern, where type is one of class, resource, title,
or icon, and pattern is an expression of the same format
used in <br>
the fvwm style command (minimalistic shell pattern
matching). Quotes around the pattern will be taken as part
of the expression. If a window could be handled by more than
one <br>
manager, then the manager with the lowest id gets it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmIconMan: [id] Show pattern
list <br>
If a window matches one of the patterns in the list, then it
may be handled by this manager.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmIconMan: [id] DontShow
pattern list <br>
If a window matches one of the patterns in the list, then it
may not be handled by this manager.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmIconMan: [id] ShowTransient
boolean <br>
Show transient windows in the list (default false).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmIconMan: [id] ShowOnlyIcons
boolean <br>
Only iconified windows are shown if boolean is true.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmIconMan: [id] ShowNoIcons
boolean <br>
Only windows that are not iconified are shown if boolean is
true.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmIconMan: [id]
ShowOnlyFocused boolean <br>
Only window with the focus is shown if boolean is true.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following two options
control tips.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmIconMan: [id] Tips value
<br>
where value can be always, needed or false. Default is
false, no tips are displayed. With always, tips are enabled.
With needed, a tip is displayed only if either the
but&acirc; <br>
ton string is truncated or the tip string is not equal to
the button string. This configuration line is respected when
FvwmIconMan is running as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmIconMan: [id] TipsDelays
delay [mappeddelay] <br>
where delay and mappeddelay are time out values in
milliseconds. If no mappeddelay is given delay is assumed.
Default is 1000 300. When the cursor is on a button,
FvwmI&acirc; <br>
conMan wait delay milliseconds before displaying the tip. In
the case where a tip is already mapped and the cursor goes
to another button, FvwmIconMan waits mappeddelay <br>
milliseconds before displaying the new tip.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmIconMan: [id] TipsFont
fontname <br>
Specifies the font to be used for tips. Default is the
default fvwm font.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmIconMan: [id] TipsColorset
colorset <br>
Specifies the colors for tips window. Default is colorset
0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmIconMan: [id] TipsFormat
formatstring <br>
Similar to the Format option but for the tips window. The
default is the format string from the Format option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmIconMan: [id]
TipsBorderWidth pixels <br>
Specifies the border width (in pixels) of the tips window.
Default is 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmIconMan: [id] TipsPlacement
value <br>
where value can be up, down, right, left, updown or
leftright. This value specifies the position of the tips
window relative to its button. Default is updown where
but&acirc; <br>
tons on the top half of the screen get tips below the
button, otherwise the tips are above the button.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmIconMan: [id]
TipsJustification value <br>
where value can be leftup, rightdown or center. Specifies
the justification (direction) of the tips window relative to
its button after the tips window has been placed. <br>
Default is leftup which means that if a tip is placed above
or below its button, then the left border of the tip and of
the button are aligned. If the tip is placed on <br>
the left or on the right of its button, leftup aligns the
top borders. rightdown and center work like leftup but in
different directions. The alignment is adjusted by the <br>
TipsOffset option. See next option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmIconMan: [id] TipsOffsets
placementoffset justoffset <br>
where placementoffset and justoffset are offsets in pixels
for the TipsPlacement and TipsJustification configuration
option. Default is 3 2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ACTIONS <br>
Actions are commands which may be bound to an event of the
type: a key press, a mouse click, or the mouse entering a
window manager button - denoted by the action types Key,
<br>
Mouse, and Select.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normally, actions bound to a
mouse click are executed when the button is pressed. In
transient mode, the action is executed when the button is
released, since it is assumed that <br>
FvwmIconMan was bound to some mouse event. A tip/warning:
FvwmIconMan still keeps track of the mouse button and any
modifier keys in this case, so if you bind FvwmIconMan to
say, <br>
meta-button3, then it would be wise to ensure that the
action you want to execute will be executed when the
meta-button3 event occurs (which would be the button
release, assuming <br>
you kept your finger on the meta key).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The syntax for actions are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Key actions: Key Keysym
Modifiers FunctionList <br>
Keysym and Modifiers are exactly the same as for the fvwm
Key command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mouse actions: Mouse Button
Modifiers FunctionList <br>
Button and Modifiers are exactly the same as for the fvwm
Mouse command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Select actions: Select
FunctionList</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A FunctionList is a sequence of
commands separated by commas. They are executed in left to
right order, in one shared context - which currently only
contains a pointer to the <br>
&quot;current&quot; button. If a button is selected
(typically by the mouse pointer sitting on it) when the
action is executed, then the current button is initialized
to that button. Oth&acirc; <br>
erwise, it points to nothing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most of the available commands
then modify this &quot;current&quot; button, either by
moving it around, making it become the selected button, or
sending commands to fvwm acting on the win&acirc; <br>
dow represented by that button. Note that while this current
button is initialized to be the selected button, the
selected button does not implicitly follow it around. This
way, <br>
the user can send commands to various windows, without
changing which button is selected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Commands take five types of
arguments: Integer, Manager, Window, Button, and String. A
String is a string specified exactly as for fvwm - either in
quotes or as a single word not <br>
in quotes. Again, you may bind a sequence of commands to an
event, by listing them separated by commas.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Window and Button types look
exactly the same in the .fvwm2rc file, but are interpreted
as either specifying a managed window, or a FvwmIconMan
button representing a window. They <br>
can either be an integer (which is interpreted module N
where N is the number of buttons - so 0 is the first and -1
is the last), or one of the strings: Select, Focus, Up,
Down, <br>
Right, Left, Next, Prev. Select and Focus refer to the
currently selected or focused button or window. Up, Down,
Right, and Left refer to the button or window above, below,
to <br>
the right of, or to the left of the current button in the
manager window, allowing navigation around the manager
window. Next and Prev designates the window, button, or
manager <br>
after or before the current button, allowing navigation of
the one dimensional list of windows which is drawn in the
manager window. If the manager is sorted, Next and Prev move
<br>
through the windows in the sorted order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Manager type can either be
an integer, Next, or Prev. The meaning is analogous to that
of the Button type, but in terms of the integral index of
the managers, restricted to <br>
managers which are nonempty.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following functions are
currently defined:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bif Button Integer/String <br>
A relative branch instruction. If Button is Select or Focus,
then take the branch if there is a selected button or a
focused button. If Button is an integer, then branch <br>
if nonzero. If it is one of Up, Down, Right, Left, Next,
Prev, then the branch is taken when the current button can
move in that direction. If the branch is taken, then <br>
Integer commands are skipped. No backwards branches are
allowed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bifn Button Integer/String <br>
The complement of bif. The branch is taken if Button
evaluates to false, by the criteria listed for bif.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gotobutton Button <br>
Sets current button to Button. If Button is an integer, then
the current button is set to Button modulo the number of
buttons, in the whichever manager contains the <br>
selected button, if any.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gotomanager Manager <br>
Sets button to button 0 of Manager. This will only go to a
visible, nonempty manager. So an integral argument is taken
modulo the number of such managers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">jmp Integer/String <br>
Executes a relative jump of Integer instructions. Backwards
jumps are not allowed. The jump is computed relative to the
instruction following the jmp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">label String <br>
Provides a label that previous instructions can jump to. It
will not be visible to subsequent jump instructions, and the
same label can be used multiple times in the same <br>
instruction list (though it would be perverse to do so.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print String <br>
Prints String to the console. Useful for debugging
actions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">printdebug <br>
Prints defined actions to the console. Should only be used
by developers. To enable this command, set CONFIG and
FUNCTIONS variables to &rsquo;1&rsquo; in the
modules/FvwmIcon&acirc; <br>
Man/debug.h and recompile this module.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">quit Quits FvwmIconMan.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">refresh <br>
Causes all manager windows to redraw themselves.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ret Stop executing the entire
action.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">searchback String <br>
Sets button to button before the current one whose printed
string in the manager window matches specified String, which
may contain wildcards.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">searchforward String <br>
Sets button to button after the current one whose printed
string in the manager window matches specified String, which
may contain wildcards.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">select Selects the current
button, if any. If a select action has been specified, it
will then be run. Therefore, it is considered unwise to set
the select button in the select <br>
action.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sendcommand Command <br>
Sends the fvwm command Command to the window represented by
the current button, if any.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">warp Warps cursor to current
button, if any.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples: <br>
gotobutton select, gotobutton Down, select <br>
Selects the button below the currently selected button.
Since the current button is already initialized to the
selected button, this may be shortened to &quot;gotobutton
Down, <br>
select&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gotobutton Up, select <br>
Selects the button above the currently selected button.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gotobutton 0, select <br>
Selects the first button of the current manager. If there is
no current manager, which is the case when no button is
selected, then this does nothing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gotobutton -1, select <br>
Selects the last button of the current manager.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gotobutton focus, select <br>
Selects the button corresponding to the focused window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gotobutton focus, Iconify <br>
Sends the fvwm command Iconify to the focused window. Note
that this does not change the selected button.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bif Next 3, gotobutton 0,
select, ret, gotobutton Next, select <br>
If a button is selected, and it&rsquo;s the last button, go
to button 0. If it&rsquo;s not the last button, go to the
next button. Otherwise, do nothing. Basically, this action
cycles <br>
through all buttons in the current manager.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bif select 7, bif focus 3,
gotomanager 0, select, ret, gotobutton focus, select, ret,
gotobutton down, select <br>
This is good for sending to FvwmIconMan with a SendToModule
command. If there is a selected button, it moves down.
Otherwise, if there is a focused button, it is selected.
Other&acirc; <br>
wise, button 0 of manager 0 gets selected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bif select Select, bif focus
Focus, gotomanager 0, select, ret, label Focus, gotobutton
focus, select, ret, label Select, gotobutton down, select
<br>
Same as previous, but using the label instruction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition to being bound to
keys and mice, actions can be sent from fvwm to FvwmIconMan
via the SendToModule command. Don&rsquo;t quote the command
when using SendToModule. Also, due <br>
to a bug in the current version of fvwm, don&rsquo;t quote
FvwmIconMan either.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SAMPLE CONFIGURATIONS <br>
This first example is of a the simplest invocation of
FvwmIconMan, which only has one manager, and handles all
windows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UNFINISHED BUSINESS <br>
There is one bug that I know of. A honest to goodness
solution to this would be appreciated. When an icon manager
is set to grow upwards or leftwards, on some machines it may
<br>
wander occasionally.</p>
