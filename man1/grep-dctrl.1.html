<p>GREP-DCTRL(1) Debian user&rsquo;s manual
GREP-DCTRL(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
grep-dctrl, grep-status, grep-available, grep-aptavail,
grep-debtags - grep Debian control files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
command --copying|-C | --help|-h | --version|-V</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">command [options] filter [
file... ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where command is one of
grep-dctrl, grep-status, grep-available, grep-aptavail and
grep-debtags.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The grep-dctrl program can answer such questions as What is
the Debian package foo?, Which version of the Debian package
bar is now current?, Which Debian packages does John Doe
<br>
maintain?, Which Debian packages are somehow related to the
Scheme programming language?, and with some help, Who
maintain the essential packages of a Debian system?, given a
<br>
useful input file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The programs grep-available,
grep-status, grep-aptavail and grep-debtags are aliases of
(actually, symbolic links to) grep-dctrl. These aliases use
as their default input the <br>
dpkg(1) available and status files, the apt-cache dumpavail
output and the debtags dumpavail output, respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">grep-dctrl is a specialised grep
program that is meant for processing any file which has the
general format of a Debian package control file, as
described in the Debian Policy. <br>
These include the dpkg available file, the dpkg status file,
and the Packages files on a distribution medium (such as a
Debian CD-ROM or an FTP site carrying Debian).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You must give a filter
expression on the command line. The filter defines which
kind of paragraphs (aka package records) are output. A
simple filter is a search pattern along <br>
with any options that modify it. Possible modifiers are
--eregex, --field, --ignore-case, --regex and --exact-match,
along with their single-letter equivalents. By default, the
<br>
search is a case-sensitive fixed substring match on each
paragraph (in other words, package record) in the input.
With suitable modifiers, this can be changed: the search can
be <br>
case-insensitive and the pattern can be seen as an extended
POSIX regular expression.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Filters can be combined to form
more complex filters using the connectives --and, --or and
--not. Parentheses (which usually need to be escaped for the
shell) can be used for <br>
grouping.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, the full matching
paragraphs are printed on the standard output; specific
fields can be selected for output with the -s option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After the filter expression
comes zero or more file names. The file name - is taken to
mean the standard input stream. The files are searched in
order but separately; they are <br>
not concatenated together. In other words, the end of a file
always implies the end of the current paragraph.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no file names are specified,
the program name is used to identify a default input file.
The program names are matched with the base form of the name
of the current program <br>
(the 0&rsquo;th command line argument, if you will).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Specifying the search pattern <br>
--pattern=pattern <br>
Specify a pattern to be searched. This switch is not
generally needed, as the pattern can be given by itself.
However, patterns that start with a dash (-) must be given
<br>
using this switch, so that they wouldn&rsquo;t be mistaken
for switches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Modifiers of simple filters <br>
-F field,field, ... | --field=field,field, ... <br>
Restrict pattern matching to the fields given. Multiple
field names in one -F option and multiple -F options in one
simple filter are allowed. The search named by the <br>
filter will be performed among all the fields named, and as
soon as any one of them matches, the whole simple filter is
considered matching.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A field specification can
contain a colon (:). In such a case, the part up to the
colon is taken as the name of the field to be searched in,
and the part after the colon <br>
is taken as the name of the field whose content is to be
used if the field to search in is empty.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P Shorthand for -FPackage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S Shorthand for
-FSource:Package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e, --eregex <br>
Regard the pattern of the current simple filter as an
extended POSIX regular expression</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, --regex <br>
Regard the pattern of the current simple filter as a
standard POSIX regular expression.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i, --ignore-case <br>
Ignore case when looking for a match in the current simple
filter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X, --exact-match <br>
Do an exact match (as opposed to a substring match) in the
current simple filter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w, --whole-pkg <br>
Do an extended regular expression match on whole package
names, assuming the syntax of inter-package relationship
fields such as Depends,Recommends, ... When this flag is
<br>
given you should not worry about sub-package names such as
&quot;libpcre3&quot; also matching &quot;libpcre3-dev&quot;.
This flag implies (and is incompatible with) -e.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--eq Do an equality comparison
under the Debian version number system. If the pattern or
the field to be searched in is not a valid Debian version
number, the paragraph is <br>
regarded as not matching. As a special case, this is capable
of comparing simple nonnegative integers for equality.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--lt Do an strictly-less-than
comparison under the Debian version number system. If the
pattern or the field to be searched in is not a valid Debian
version number, the para&acirc; <br>
graph is regarded as not matching. As a special case, this
is capable of comparing simple nonnegative integers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--le Do an less-than-or-equal
comparison under the Debian version number system. If the
pattern or the field to be searched in is not a valid Debian
version number, the para&acirc; <br>
graph is regarded as not matching. As a special case, this
is capable of comparing simple nonnegative integers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--gt Do an strictly-greater-than
comparison under the Debian version number system. If the
pattern or the field to be searched in is not a valid Debian
version number, the <br>
paragraph is regarded as not matching. As a special case,
this is capable of comparing simple nonnegative
integers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ge Do an greater-than-or-equal
comparison under the Debian version number system. If the
pattern or the field to be searched in is not a valid Debian
version number, the <br>
paragraph is regarded as not matching. As a special case,
this is capable of comparing simple nonnegative
integers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Combining filters <br>
-!, --not, ! <br>
Match if the following filter does not match.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o, --or <br>
Match if either one or both of the preceding and following
filters matches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a, --and <br>
Match if both the preceding and the following filter
match.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">( ... ) <br>
Parentheses can be used for grouping. Note that they need to
be escaped for most shells. Filter modifiers can be given
before the opening parentheses; they will be <br>
treated as if they had been repeated for each simple filter
inside the parentheses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Output format modifiers <br>
-l, --files-with-matches <br>
Output only the file names, each on its own line, of those
files that contain at least one matching paragraph. This is
incompatible with the -v and -L options, and all <br>
other output format modifiers will be ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L, --files-without-matches <br>
Output only the file names, each on its own line, of those
files that do not contain any matching paragraphs. This is
incompatible with the -v and -l options, and all <br>
other output format modifiers will be ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s field,field, ... |
--show-field=field,field, ... <br>
Show only the body of these fields from the matching
paragraphs. The field names must not include any colons or
commas. Commas are used to delimit field names in the <br>
argument to this option. The fields are shown in the order
given here. See also the option -I. Note that in the absence
of the --ensure--dctrl option, if only one field <br>
is selected, no paragraph separator is output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I, --invert-show <br>
Invert the meaning of option -s: show only the fields that
have not been named using a -s option. As an artefact of the
implementation, the order of the fields in the <br>
original paragraph is not preserved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A field specification can
contain a colon. In such a case, the part up to the colon is
taken as the name of the field to be shown, and the part
after the colon is taken as the <br>
name of the field whose content is to be used if the field
to be shown is empty.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Show only the first line of
the Description field from the matching paragraphs. If no -s
option is specified, this option also effects -s
Description; if there is a -s <br>
option but it does not include the Description field name,
one is appended to the option. Thus the Description
field&rsquo;s location in the output is determined by the -s
<br>
option, if any, the last field being the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --no-field-names <br>
Suppress field names when showing specified fields, only
their bodies are shown. Each field is printed in its
original form without the field name, the colon after it and
<br>
any whitespace preceding the start of the body.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --invert-match <br>
Instead of showing all the paragraphs that match, show those
paragraphs that do not match.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --count <br>
Instead of showing the paragraphs that match (or, with -v,
that don&rsquo;t match), show the count of those
paragraphs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q, --quiet, --silent <br>
Output nothing to the standard output stream. Instead, exit
immediately after finding the first match.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Miscellaneous <br>
--ensure-dctrl <br>
Ensure that the output is in dctrl format, specifically that
there always is an empty line separating paragraphs. This
option is not honored if the -n option has been <br>
selected, as that option deliberately requests a non-dctrl
format for the output. In a future version, this option may
be made the default behaviour.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--compat <br>
Override any --ensure-dctrl option given earlier on the
command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ignore-parse-errors <br>
Ignore errors in parsing input. A paragraph which cannot be
parsed is ignored in its entirety, and the next paragraph is
assumed to start after the first newline since <br>
the location of the error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--debug-optparse <br>
Show how the current command line has been parsed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--errorlevel=level <br>
Set log level to level. level is one of fatal, important,
informational and debug, but the last may not be available,
depending on the compile-time options. These cate&acirc;
<br>
gories are given here in order; every message that is
emitted when fatal is in effect, will be emitted in the
important error level, and so on. The default is
important.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
Print out version information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C, --copying <br>
Print out the copyright license. This produces much output;
be sure to redirect or pipe it somewhere (such as your
favourite pager).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Print out a help summary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
The almost simplest use of this program is to print out the
status or available record of a package. In this respect,
grep-dctrl is like dpkg -s or dpkg --print-avail. To print
<br>
out the status record of the package &quot;mixal&quot;, do
<br>
% grep-status -PX mixal <br>
and to get its available record, use <br>
% grep-available -PX mixal <br>
In fact, you can ask for the record of the &quot;mixal&quot;
package from any Debian control file. Say, you have the
Debian 6.0 CD-ROM&rsquo;s Packages file in the current
directory; now you <br>
can do a <br>
% grep-dctrl -PX mixal Packages</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">But grep-dctrl can do more than
just emulate dpkg. It can more-or-less emulate apt-cache!
That program has a search feature that searches package
descriptions. But we can do <br>
that too: <br>
% grep-available -F Description foo <br>
searches for the string &quot;foo&quot; case-sensitively in
the descriptions of all available packages. If you want
case-insensitivity, use <br>
% grep-available -F Description -i foo <br>
Truth to be told, apt-cache searches package names, too. We
can separately search in the names; to do so, do <br>
% grep-available -F Package foo <br>
or <br>
% grep-available -P foo <br>
which is pretty much the same thing. We can also search in
both descriptions and names; if match is found in either,
the package record is printed: <br>
% grep-available -P -F Description foo <br>
or <br>
% grep-available -F Package -F Description foo <br>
This kind of search is the exactly same that apt-cache
does.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here&rsquo;s one thing neither
dpkg nor apt-cache do. Search for a string in the whole
status or available file (or any Debian control file, for
that matter) and print out all package <br>
records where we have a match. Try <br>
% grep-available dpkg <br>
sometime and watch how thoroughly dpkg has infiltrated
Debian.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All the above queries were based
on simple substring searches. But grep-dctrl can handle
regular expressions in the search pattern. For example, to
see the status records of <br>
all packages with either &quot;apt&quot; or &quot;dpkg&quot;
in their names, use <br>
% grep-status -P -e &rsquo;apt|dpkg&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Now that we have seen all these
fine and dandy queries, you might begin to wonder whether it
is necessary to always see the whole paragraph. You may be,
for example, interest <br>
only in the dependency information of the packages involved.
Fine. To show the depends lines of all packages maintained
by me, do a <br>
% grep-available -F Maintainer -s Depends
&rsquo;ajk@debian.org&rsquo; <br>
If you want to see the packages&rsquo; names, too, use <br>
% grep-available -F Maintainer -s Package,Depends
&rsquo;ajk@debian.org&rsquo; <br>
Note that there must be no spaces in the argument to the -s
switch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">More complex queries are also
possible. For example, to see the list of packages
maintained by me and depending on libc6, do <br>
% grep-available -F Maintainer &rsquo;ajk@debian.org&rsquo;
-a -F Depends libc6 -s Package,Depends <br>
Remember that you can use other UNIX filters to help you,
too. Ever wondered, who&rsquo;s the most active Debian
developer based on the number of source packages being
maintained? <br>
Easy. You just need to have a copy of the most recent
Sources file from any Debian mirror. <br>
% grep-dctrl -n -s Maintainer &rsquo;&rsquo; Sources | sort
| uniq -c | sort -nr <br>
This example shows a neat trick: if you want to selectively
show only some field of all packages, just supply an empty
pattern.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The term &quot;bogopackage&quot;
means the count of the packages that a Debian developer
maintains. To get the bogopackage count for the maintainer
of dctrl-tools, say <br>
% grep-available -c -FMaintainer &quot;&lsquo;grep-available
-sMaintainer -n -PX dctrl-tools&lsquo;&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sometimes it is useful to output
the data of several fields on the same line. For example,
the following command outputs the list of installed
packages, sorted by their <br>
Installed-Size. <br>
% grep-status -FStatus -sInstalled-Size,Package -n
&quot;install ok installed&quot; -a -FInstalled-Size --gt 0
| paste -sd &quot; 0 | sort -n <br>
Note that there should be exactly 2 spaces in the &quot; 0
string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another usual use-case is
looking for packages that have another one as build
dependency: <br>
% grep-dctrl -s Package -F Build-Depends,Build-Depends-Indep
quilt /var/lib/apt/lists/*Sources</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These examples cover a lot of
typical uses of this utility, but not all possible uses. Use
your imagination! The building blocks are there, and if
something&rsquo;s missing, let me <br>
know.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
In the absence of errors, the exit code 0 is used if at
least one match was found, and the exit code 1 is used if no
matches were found. If there were errors, the exit code is
<br>
2, with one exception. If the -q, --quiet or --silent
options are used, the exit code 0 is used when a match is
found regardless of whether there have been non-fatal
errors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These messages are emitted in
log levels fatal and important. Additional messages may be
provided by the system libraries. This list is
incomplete.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A pattern is mandatory <br>
You must specify a pattern to be searched for.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">malformed filter <br>
No filter was specified, but one is required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cannot find enough memory <br>
More memory was needed than was available. This error may be
transient, that is, if you try again, all may go well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cannot suppress field names when
showing whole paragraphs <br>
When you do not use the -s switch, grep-dctrl just passes
the matching paragraphs through, not touching them any way.
This means, for example, that you can only use -n <br>
when you use -s.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">inconsistent modifiers of simple
filters <br>
Conflicting modifiers of simple filters were used; for
example, perhaps both -X and -e were specified for the same
simple filter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">missing &rsquo;)&rsquo; in
command line <br>
There were more opening than closing parentheses in the
given filter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">no such log level <br>
The argument to --errorlevel was invalid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">too many file names <br>
The number of file names specified in the command line
exceeded a compile-time limit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">too many output fields <br>
The argument to -s had too many field names in it. This
number is limited to 256.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unexpected &rsquo;)&rsquo; in
command line <br>
There was no opening parenthesis that would match some
closing parenthesis in the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/var/lib/dpkg/available <br>
The default input file of grep-available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/var/lib/dpkg/status <br>
The default input file of grep-status.</p>
