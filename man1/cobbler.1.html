cobbler - a provisioning and update server
<div class="Pp"></div>
cobbler is a provisioning (installation) and update server. It supports
  deployments via PXE (network booting), virtualization (Xen, QEMU/KVM, or
  VMware), and re-installs of existing Linux systems. The latter two features
  are enabled by usage of 'koan' on the remote system. Update server features
  include yum mirroring and integration of those mirrors with kickstart. Cobbler
  has a command line interface, Web UI, and extensive Python and XMLRPC APIs for
  integration with external scripts and applications.

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
Cobbler manages provisioning using a tiered concept of Distributions, Profiles,
  Systems, and (optionally) Images and Repositories.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Distributions contain information about what kernel and initrd are used, plus
  metadata (required kernel parameters, etc).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Profiles associate a Distribution with a kickstart file and optionally customize
  the metadata further.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Systems associate a MAC, IP, and other networking details with a profile and
  optionally customize the metadata further.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Repositories contain yum mirror information. Using cobbler to mirror
  repositories is an optional feature, though provisioning and package
  management share a lot in common.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Images are a catch-all concept for things that do not play nicely in the
  &quot;distribution&quot; category. Most users will not need these records
  initially and these are described later in the document.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The main advantage of cobbler is that it glues together many disjoint
  technologies and concepts and abstracts the user from the need to understand
  them. It allows the systems administrator to concentrate on what he needs to
  do, and not how it is done.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This manpage will focus on the cobbler command line tool for use in configuring
  cobbler. There is also mention of the Cobbler WebUI which is usable for
  day-to-day operation of Cobbler once installed/configured. Docs on the API and
  XMLRPC components are available online at http://cobbler.github.io
<div class="Pp"></div>
Most users will be interested in the Web UI and should set it up, though the
  command line is needed for initial configuration -- in particular
  &quot;cobbler check&quot; and &quot;cobbler import&quot;, as well as the repo
  mirroring features. All of these are described later in the documentation.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SEE_ALSO"><a class="selflink" href="#SEE_ALSO">SEE
  ALSO</a></h1>
For help in building kickstarts, try using the
  &quot;system-config-kickstart&quot; tool, or install a new system and look at
  the /root/anaconda-ks.cfg file left over from the installer. General kickstart
  questions can also be asked at kickstart-list@redhat.com. Cobbler ships some
  kickstart templates in /etc/cobbler that may also prove helpful.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Also see the aforementioned webpages for additional documentation, user
  contributed tips, and so on.

  USAGE</a></h1>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="SETUP"><a class="selflink" href="#SETUP">SETUP</a></h2>
After installing, run &quot;cobbler check&quot; to verify that cobbler's
  ecosystem is configured correctly. Cobbler check will direct you on how to
  modify it's config files using a text editor.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Any problems detected should be corrected, with the potential exception of DHCP
  related warnings where you will need to use your judgement as to whether they
  apply to your environment. Run &quot;cobbler sync&quot; after making any
  changes to the configuration files to ensure those changes are applied to the
  environment.
<div class="Pp"></div>
It is especially important that the server name field be accurate in
  /etc/cobbler/settings, without this field being correct, kickstart trees will
  not be found, and automated installations will fail.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For PXE, if DHCP is to be run from the cobbler server, the dhcp configuration
  file should be changed as suggested by &quot;cobbler check&quot;. If DHCP is
  not run locally, the &quot;next-server&quot; field on the DHCP server should
  at minimum point to the cobbler server's IP and the filename should be set to
  &quot;pxelinux.0&quot;. Alternatively, cobbler can also generate your dhcp
  configuration file if you want to run dhcp locally -- this is covered in a
  later section. If you don't already have a DHCP setup managed by some other
  tool, allowing cobbler to manage your DHCP environment will prove to be useful
  as it can manage DHCP reservations and other data. If you already have a DHCP
  setup, moving an existing setup to be managed from within cobbler is
  relatively painless -- though usage of the DHCP management feature is entirely
  optional. If you are not interested in network booting via PXE and just want
  to use koan to install virtual systems or replace existing ones, DHCP
  configuration can be totally ignored. Koan also has a live CD (see koan's
  manpage) capability that can be used to simulate PXE environments.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="DISTRIBUTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#DISTRIBUTIONS">DISTRIBUTIONS</a></h2>
This first step towards configuring what you want to install is to add a
  distribution record to cobbler's configuration.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If there is an rsync mirror, DVD, NFS, or filesystem tree available that you
  would rather import instead, skip down to the documentation about the
  &quot;import&quot; command. It's really a lot easier to follow the import
  workflow -- it only requires waiting for the mirror content to be copied
  and/or scanned. Imported mirrors also save time during install since they
  don't have to hit external install sources.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you want to be explicit with distribution definition, however, here's how it
  works:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>cobbler distro add --name=string --kernel=path --initrd=path [--kopts=string]
  [--kopts-post=string] [--ksmeta=string] [--arch=x86|x86_64|ia64]

<dl class="Bl-tag">

<dl class="Bl-tag">

  <dd class="It-tag">Sets kernel command-line arguments that the distro, and
      profiles/systems depending on it, will use. To remove a kernel argument
      that may be added by a higher cobbler object (or in the global settings),
      you can prefix it with a &quot;!&quot;.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Example: --kopts=&quot;foo=bar baz=3 asdf !gulp&quot;
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This example passes the arguments &quot;foo=bar baz=3 asdf&quot; but will
      make sure &quot;gulp&quot; is not passed even if it was requested at a
      level higher up in the cobbler configuration.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">kopts-post</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This is just like --kopts, though it governs kernel options
      on the installed OS, as opposed to kernel options fed to the installer.
      The syntax is exactly the same. This requires some special snippets to be
      found in your kickstart template in order for this to work. Kickstart
      templating is described later on in this document.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Example: &quot;noapic&quot;</dd>

    The default setting ('standard') will use pxelinux. Set to 'ia64' to use
      elilo. 'ppc' and 'ppc64' use yaboot. 's390x' is not PXEable, but koan
      supports it for reinstalls.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    'x86' and 'x86_64' effectively do the same thing as standard.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If you perform a cobbler import, the arch field will be auto-assigned.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">ksmeta</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This is an advanced feature that sets kickstart variables
      to substitute, thus enabling kickstart files to be treated as templates.
      Templates are powered using Cheetah and are described further along in
      this manpage as well as on the Cobbler Wiki.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Example: --ksmeta=&quot;foo=bar baz=3 asdf&quot;

      CentOS as well. It means anything redhat based.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    There is limited experimental support for specifying &quot;debian&quot;,
      &quot;ubuntu&quot;, or &quot;suse&quot;, which treats the kickstart file
      as a different format and changes the kernel arguments appropriately.
      Support for other types of distributions is possible in the future. See
      the Wiki for the latest information about support for these distributions.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The file used for the answer file, regardless of the breed setting, is the
      value used for --kickstart when creating the profile. In other words, if
      another distro calls their answer file something other than a
      &quot;kickstart&quot;, the kickstart parameter still governs where that
      answer file is.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">os-version</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Generally this field can be ignored. It is intended to
      alter some hardware setup for virtualized instances when provisioning
      guests with koan. The valid options for --os-version vary depending on
      what is specified for --breed. If you specify an invalid option, the error
      message will contain a list of valid os versions that can be used. If you
      do not know the os version or it does not appear in the list, omitting
      this argument or using &quot;other&quot; should be perfectly fine. Largely
      this is needed to support older distributions in virtualized settings,
      such as &quot;rhel2.1&quot;, one of the OS choices if the breed is set to
      &quot;redhat&quot;. If you do not encounter any problems with virtualized
      instances, this option can be safely ignored.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">owners</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Users with small sites and a limited number of admins can
      probably ignore this option. All cobbler objects (distros, profiles,
      systems, and repos) can take a --owners parameter to specify what cobbler
      users can edit particular objects. This only applies to the Cobbler WebUI
      and XMLRPC interface, not the &quot;cobbler&quot; command line tool run
      from the shell. Furthermore, this is only respected by the
      &quot;authz_ownership&quot; module which must be enabled in
      /etc/cobbler/modules.conf. The value for --owners is a space separated
      list of users and groups as specified in /etc/cobbler/users.conf. For more
      information see the users.conf file as well as the Cobbler Wiki. In the
      default Cobbler configuration, this value is completely ignored, as is
      users.conf.</dd>

  <dd class="It-tag">This feature allows cobbler to be used as a configuration
      management system. The argument is a space delimited string of key=value
      pairs. Each key is the path to a template file, each value is the path to
      install the file on the system. This is described in further detail on the
      Cobbler Wiki and is implemented using special code in the post install.
      Koan also can retrieve these files from a cobbler server on demand,
      effectively allowing cobbler to function as a lightweight templated

<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="PROFILES"><a class="selflink" href="#PROFILES">PROFILES</a></h2>
A profile associates a distribution to additional specialized options, such as a
  kickstart automation file. Profiles are the core unit of provisioning and at
  least one profile must exist for every distribution to be provisioned. A
  profile might represent, for instance, a web server or desktop configuration.
  In this way, profiles define a role to be performed.

      a compatible installation type on the client system (&quot;auto&quot;).
      See the &quot;koan&quot; manpage for more documentation. The default
      virt-type can be configured in the cobbler settings file such that this

  <dd class="It-tag">(Virt-only) Where to store the virtual image on the host

    For multiple disks, separate the values with commas such as

  <dt class="It-tag">virt-bridge</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">(Virt-only) This specifies the default bridge to use for
      all systems defined under this profile. If not specified, it will assume
      the default value in the cobbler settings file, which as shipped in the
      RPM is 'xenbr0'. If using KVM, this is most likely not correct. You may
      want to override this setting in the system object. Bridge settings are
      important as they define how outside networking will reach the guest. For
      more information on bridge setup, see the Cobbler Wiki, where there is a

      --repos=&quot;fc6i386updates fc6i386extras&quot; if the profile wants to

<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="SYSTEMS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYSTEMS">SYSTEMS</a></h2>
System records map a piece of hardware (or a virtual machine) with the cobbler
  profile to be assigned to run on it. This may be thought of as choosing a role
  for a specific system.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that if provisioning via koan and PXE menus alone, it is not required to
  create system records in cobbler, though they are useful when system specific
  customizations are required. One such customization would be defining the MAC
  address. If there is a specific role intended for a given machine, system
  records should be created for it.
<div class="Pp"></div>
System commands have a wider variety of control offered over network details. In
  order to use these to the fullest possible extent, the kickstart template used
  by cobbler must contain certain kickstart snippets (sections of code
  specifically written for Cobbler to make these values become reality). Compare
  your kickstart templates with the stock ones in /var/lib/cobbler/kickstarts if
  you have upgraded, to make sure you can take advantage of all options to their
  fullest potential. If you are a new cobbler user, base your kickstarts off of
  these templates. Non-kickstart based distributions, while supported by
  Cobbler, may not be able to use all of these features.

    If the name looks like a MAC address or an IP, the name will implicitly be

    MAC addresses have the format AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF. It's highly recommended to
      register your MAC-addresses in Cobbler if you're using static addressing
      with multiple interfaces, or if you are using any of the advanced
      networking features like bonding, bridges or VLANs.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Cobbler does contain a feature (enabled in /etc/cobbler/settings) that can
      automatically add new system records when it finds profiles being
      provisioned on hardware it has seen before. This may help if you do not
      have a report of all the MAC addresses in your datacenter/lab
      configuration.</dd>

  <dd class="It-tag">If cobbler is configured to generate a DHCP configuration
      (see advanced section), use this setting to define a specific IP for this
      system in DHCP. Leaving off this parameter will result in no DHCP
      management for this particular system.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Example: --ip-address=192.168.1.50
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Note for Itanium users: this setting is always required for IA64 regardless

    Additional interfaces can be specified (for example: eth1, or any name you

      physical network interfaces to one single logical interface to reduce
      single points of failure in your network, or to create bridged interfaces
      for things like tunnels and virtual machine networks. Supported values for
      the --interface-type parameter are &quot;bond&quot;,
      &quot;bond_slave&quot;, &quot;bridge&quot;, &quot;bridge_slave&quot; and
      &quot;bonded_bridge_slave&quot;. If one of the &quot;_slave&quot; options
      is specified, you also need to define the master-interface for this bond
      using --interface-master=INTERFACE. Bonding and bridge options for the
      master-interface may be specified using --bonding-opts=&quot;foo=1
      bar=2&quot; or --bridge-opts=&quot;foo=1 bar=2&quot;, respectively.

Repository mirroring allows cobbler to mirror not only install trees
  (&quot;cobbler import&quot; does this for you) but also optional packages, 3rd
  party content, and even updates. Mirroring all of this content locally on your
  network will result in faster, more up-to-date installations and faster
  updates. If you are only provisioning a home setup, this will probably be
  overkill, though it can be very useful for larger setups (labs, datacenters,
  etc).

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The mirror address should specify an exact repository to mirror -- just one
      architecture and just one distribution. If you have a separate repo to
      mirror for a different arch, add that repo separately.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Here's an example of what looks like a good URL:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    rsync://yourmirror.example.com/fedora-linux-core/updates/6/i386 (for rsync

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Experimental support is also provided for mirroring RHN content when you
      need a fast local mirror. The mirror syntax for this is
      --mirror=rhn://channel-name and you must have entitlements for this to
      work. This requires the cobbler server to be installed on RHEL5 or later.

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This name corresponds with values given to the --repos parameter of
      &quot;cobbler profile add&quot;. If a profile has a --repos value that

      server as a mirror (unless &quot;yum_post_install_mirror&quot; is disabled

      mirror to systems it installs, which may not be desirable for laptop
      configurations, etc.

<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="REPLICATING"><a class="selflink" href="#REPLICATING">REPLICATING</a></h2>
Cobbler can replicate configurations from a master cobbler server. Each cobbler
  server is still expected to have a locally relevant /etc/cobbler/cobbler.conf
  and modules.conf, as these files are not synced.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This feature is intended for load-balancing, disaster-recovery, backup, or
  multiple geography support.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>cobbler replicate --master=cobbler.example.org [--distros=pattern]
  [--profiles=pattern] [--systems=pattern] [--repos-pattern] [--images=pattern]
  [--prune] [--omit-data]</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Cobbler can replicate data from a central server.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Objects that need to be replicated should be specified with a pattern, such as
  --profiles=&quot;webservers* dbservers*&quot; or
  --systems=&quot;*.example.org&quot;. All objects matched by the pattern, and
  all dependencies of those objects matched by the pattern (recursively) will be
  transferred from the remote server to the central server. This is to say if
  you intend to transfer &quot;*.example.org&quot; and the definition of the
  systems have not changed, but a profile above them has changed, the changes to
  that profile will also be transferred.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In the case where objects are more recent on the local server, those changes
  will not be overridden locally.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Common data locations will be rsync'ed from the master server unless --omit-data
  is specified.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To delete objects that are no longer present on the master server, use --prune.
  Warning: this will delete all object types not present on the remote server
  from the local server, and is recursive. If you use prune, it is best to
  manage cobbler centrally and not expect changes made on the slave servers to
  be preserved. It is not currently possible to just prune objects of a specific
  type.

<b>cobbler sync</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Cobbler sync is used to repair or rebuild the contents /tftpboot or
  /var/www/cobbler when something has changed behind the scenes. It brings the
  filesystem up to date with the configuration as understood by cobbler.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Sync should be run whenever files in /var/lib/cobbler are manually edited (which
  is not recommended except for the settings file) or when making changes to
  kickstart files. In practice, this should not happen often, though running
  sync too many times does not cause any adverse effects.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If using cobbler to manage a DHCP and/or DNS server (see the advanced section of
  this manpage), sync does need to be run after systems are added to regenerate
  and reload the DHCP/DNS configurations.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The sync process can also be kicked off from the web interface.

<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="IMPORT_WORKFLOW"><a class="selflink" href="#IMPORT_WORKFLOW">IMPORT
  WORKFLOW</a></h2>
Import is a very useful command that makes starting out with cobbler very quick
  and easy.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This example shows how to create a provisioning infrastructure from a
  distribution mirror or DVD ISO. Then a default PXE configuration is created,
  so that by default systems will PXE boot into a fully automated install
  process for that distribution.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can use a network rsync mirror, a mounted DVD location, or a tree you have
  available via a network filesystem.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Import knows how to autodetect the architecture of what is being imported,
  though to make sure things are named correctly, it's always a good idea to
  specify --arch. For instance, if you import a distribution named
  &quot;fedora8&quot; from an ISO, and it's an x86_64 ISO, specify --arch=x86_64
  and the distro will be named &quot;fedora8-x86_64&quot; automatically, and the
  right architecture field will also be set on the distribution object. If you
  are batch importing an entire mirror (containing multiple distributions and
  arches), you don't have to do this, as cobbler will set the names for things
  based on the paths it finds.

For Virt, be sure the distro uses the correct kernel (if paravirt) and follow
  similar steps as above, adding additional parameters as desired:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>cobbler distro add --name=fc7virt [options...]</b>

Specify reasonable values for the Virt image size (in GB) and RAM requirements

<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>cobbler profile add --name=virtwebservers --distro=fc7virt --kickstart=path
  --virt-file-size=10 --virt-ram=512 [...]</b>

<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="PXE_MENUS"><a class="selflink" href="#PXE_MENUS">PXE
  MENUS</a></h2>
Cobbler will automatically generate PXE menus for all profiles it has defined.
  Running &quot;cobbler sync&quot; is required to generate and update these
  menus.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To access the menus, type &quot;menu&quot; at the &quot;boot:&quot; prompt while
  a system is PXE booting. If nothing is typed, the network boot will default to
  a local boot. If &quot;menu&quot; is typed, the user can then choose and
  provision any cobbler profile the system knows about.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the association between a system (MAC address) and a profile is already
  known, it may be more useful to just use &quot;system add&quot; commands and
  declare that relationship in cobbler; however many use cases will prefer
  having a PXE system, especially when provisioning is done at the same time as
  installing new physical machines.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If this behavior is not desired, run &quot;cobbler system add --name=default
  --profile=plugh&quot; to default all PXE booting machines to get a new copy of
  the profile &quot;plugh&quot;. To go back to the menu system, run
  &quot;cobbler system remove --name=default&quot; and then &quot;cobbler
  sync&quot; to regenerate the menus.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When using PXE menu deployment exclusively, it is not necessary to make cobbler
  system records, although the two can easily be mixed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Additionally, note that all files generated for the pxe menu configurations are
  templatable, so if you wish to change the color scheme or equivalent, see the
  files in /etc/cobbler.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="KICKSTART_TEMPLATING"><a class="selflink" href="#KICKSTART_TEMPLATING">KICKSTART
  TEMPLATING</a></h2>
The --ksmeta options above require more explanation.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If and only if --kickstart options reference filesystem URIs, --ksmeta allows
  for templating of the kickstart files to achieve advanced functions. If the
  --ksmeta option for a profile read --ksmeta=&quot;foo=7 bar=llama&quot;,
  anywhere in the kickstart file where the string &quot;$bar&quot; appeared
  would be replaced with the string &quot;llama&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To apply these changes, &quot;cobbler sync&quot; must be run to generate custom
  kickstarts for each profile/system.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Templated kickstart files are processed by the templating program/package
  Cheetah, so anything you can do in a Cheetah template can be done to a
  kickstart template. Learn more at http://www.cheetahtemplate.org/learn.html
<div class="Pp"></div>
When working with Cheetah, be sure to escape any shell macros that look like
  &quot;$(this)&quot; with something like &quot;\$(this)&quot; or errors may
  show up during the sync process.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The Cobbler Wiki also contains numerous Cheetah examples that should prove
  useful in using this feature.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="KICKSTART_SNIPPETS"><a class="selflink" href="#KICKSTART_SNIPPETS">KICKSTART
  SNIPPETS</a></h2>
Anywhere a kickstart template mentions SNIPPET::snippet_name, the file named
  /var/lib/cobbler/snippets/snippet_name (if present) will be included
  automatically in the kickstart template. This serves as a way to recycle
  frequently used kickstart snippets without duplication. Snippets can contain
  templating variables, and the variables will be evaluated according to the
  profile and/or system as one would expect.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Snippets can also be overridden for specific profile names or system names. This
  is described on the Cobbler Wiki.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="KICKSTART_VALIDATION"><a class="selflink" href="#KICKSTART_VALIDATION">KICKSTART
  VALIDATION</a></h2>
To check for potential errors in kickstarts, prior to installation, use
  &quot;cobbler validateks&quot;. This function will check all profile and
  system kickstarts for detectable errors. Since pykickstart is not
  future-Anaconda-version aware, there may be some false positives. It should be
  noted that &quot;cobbler validateks&quot; runs on the rendered kickstart
  output, not kickstart templates themselves.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="DHCP_MANAGEMENT"><a class="selflink" href="#DHCP_MANAGEMENT">DHCP
  MANAGEMENT</a></h2>
Cobbler can optionally help you manage DHCP server. This feature is off by
  default.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Choose either &quot;management = isc_and_bind&quot; in
  /etc/cobbler/dhcp.template or &quot;management = &quot;dnsmasq&quot; in
  /etc/cobbler/modules.conf. Then set &quot;manage_dhcp&quot; to 1 in
  /etc/cobbler/settings.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This allows DHCP to be managed via &quot;cobbler system add&quot; commands, when
  you specify the mac address and IP address for systems you add into cobbler.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Depending on your choice, cobbler will use /etc/cobbler/dhcpd.template or
  /etc/cobbler/dnsmasq.template as a starting point. This file must be user
  edited for the user's particular networking environment. Read the file and
  understand how the particular app (ISC dhcpd or dnsmasq) work before
  proceeding.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you already have DHCP configuration data that you would like to preserve (say
  DHCP was manually configured earlier), insert the relevant portions of it into
  the template file, as running &quot;cobbler sync&quot; will overwrite your
  previous configuration.
<div class="Pp"></div>
NOTE: Itanium systems names also need to be assigned to a distro that was
  created with the &quot;--arch=ia64&quot; parameter. If you have Itanium
  systems, you must (for now) choose 'dhcp_isc' for /etc/cobbler/modules.conf
  and manage_dhcp in the /etc/cobbler/settings file, and are required to use
  --ip when creating the system object in order for those systems to PXE. This
  is due to an elilo limitation.
<div class="Pp"></div>
By default, the DHCP configuration file will be updated each time &quot;cobbler
  sync&quot; is run, and not until then, so it is important to remember to use
  &quot;cobbler sync&quot; when using this feature.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If omapi_enabled is set to 1 in /etc/cobbler/settings, the need to sync when
  adding new system records can be eliminated. However, the omapi feature is
  experimental and is not recommended for most users.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="DNS_CONFIGURATION_MANAGEMENT"><a class="selflink" href="#DNS_CONFIGURATION_MANAGEMENT">DNS
  CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT</a></h2>
Cobbler can optionally manage DNS configuration using BIND and dnsmasq.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Choose either &quot;management = isc_and_bind&quot; or &quot;management =
  dnsmasq&quot; in /etc/cobbler/modules.conf and then enable manage_dns in
  /etc/cobbler/settings.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This feature is off by default. If using BIND, you must define the zones to be
  managed with the options 'manage_forward_zones' and 'manage_reverse_zones'.
  (See the Wiki for more information on this).
<div class="Pp"></div>
If using BIND, Cobbler will use /etc/cobbler/named.template and
  /etc/cobbler/zone.template as a starting point for the named.conf and
  individual zone files, respectively. You may drop zone-specific template files
  in /etc/cobbler/zone_templates/name-of-zone which will override the default.
  These files must be user edited for the user's particular networking
  environment. Read the file and understand how BIND works before proceeding.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If using dnsmasq, the template is /etc/cobbler/dnsmasq.template. Read this file
  and understand how dnsmasq works before proceeding.
<div class="Pp"></div>
All managed files (whether zone files and named.conf for BIND, or dnsmasq.conf
  for dnsmasq) will be updated each time ``cobbler sync'' is run, and not until
  then, so it is important to remember to use ``cobbler sync'' when using this
  feature.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="SERVICE_DISCOVERY_(AVAHI)"><a class="selflink" href="#SERVICE_DISCOVERY_(AVAHI)">SERVICE
  DISCOVERY (AVAHI)</a></h2>
If the avahi-tools package is installed, cobblerd will broadcast it's presence
  on the network, allowing it to be discovered by koan with the koan
  --server=DISCOVER parameter.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="IMPORTING_TREES"><a class="selflink" href="#IMPORTING_TREES">IMPORTING
  TREES</a></h2>
Cobbler can auto-add distributions and profiles from remote sources, whether
  this is a filesystem path or an rsync mirror. This can save a lot of time when
  setting up a new provisioning environment. Import is a feature that many users
  will want to take advantage of, and is very simple to use.
<div class="Pp"></div>
After an import is run, cobbler will try to detect the distribution type and
  automatically assign kickstarts. By default, it will provision the system by
  erasing the hard drive, setting up eth0 for dhcp, and using a default password
  of &quot;cobbler&quot;. If this is undesirable, edit the kickstart files in
  /etc/cobbler to do something else or change the kickstart setting after
  cobbler creates the profile.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Mirrored content is saved automatically in /var/www/cobbler/ks_mirror.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Example: <b>cobbler import --path=rsync://mirrorserver.example.com/path/
  --name=fedora --arch=x86</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Example2: <b>cobbler import --path=root@192.168.1.10:/stuff --name=bar</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Example3: <b>cobbler import --path=/mnt/dvd --name=baz --arch=x86_64</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Example4: <b>cobbler import --path=/path/to/stuff --name=glorp</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Example5: <b>cobbler import --path=/path/where/filer/is/mounted --name=anyname
  --available-as=nfs://nfs.example.org:/where/mounted/</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Once imported, run a &quot;cobbler list&quot; or &quot;cobbler report&quot; to
  see what you've added.
<div class="Pp"></div>
By default, the rsync operations will exclude content of certain architectures,
  debug RPMs, and ISO images -- to change what is excluded during an import, see
  /etc/cobbler/rsync.exclude.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that all of the import commands will mirror install tree content into
  /var/www/cobbler unless a network accessible location is given with
  --available-as. --available-as will be primarily used when importing distros
  stored on an external NAS box, or potentially on another partition on the same
  machine that is already accessible via http:// or ftp://.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For import methods using rsync, additional flags can be passed to rsync with the
  option --rsync-flags.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Should you want to force the usage of a specific cobbler kickstart template for
  all profiles created by an import, you can feed the option --kickstart to
  import, to bypass the built-in kickstart auto-detection.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="DEFAULT_PXE_BOOT_BEHAVIOR"><a class="selflink" href="#DEFAULT_PXE_BOOT_BEHAVIOR">DEFAULT
  PXE BOOT BEHAVIOR</a></h2>
What happens when PXE booting a system when cobbler has no record of the system
  being booted?
<div class="Pp"></div>
By default, cobbler will configure PXE to boot to the contents of
  /etc/cobbler/default.pxe, which (if unmodified) will just fall through to the
  local boot process. Administrators can modify this file if they like to change
  that behavior.
<div class="Pp"></div>
An easy way to specify a default cobbler profile to PXE boot is to create a
  system named &quot;default&quot;. This will cause /etc/cobbler/default.pxe to
  be ignored. To restore the previous behavior do a &quot;cobbler system
  remove&quot; on the &quot;default&quot; system.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>cobbler system add --name=default --profile=boot_this</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>cobbler system remove --name=default</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
As mentioned in earlier sections, it is also possible to control the default
  behavior for a specific network:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>cobbler system add --name=network1 --ip-address=192.168.0.0/24
  --profile=boot_this</b>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="REPO_MANAGEMENT"><a class="selflink" href="#REPO_MANAGEMENT">REPO
  MANAGEMENT</a></h2>
This has already been covered a good bit in the command reference section.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Yum repository management is an optional feature, and is not required to
  provision through cobbler. However, if cobbler is configured to mirror certain
  repositories, it can then be used to associate profiles with those
  repositories. Systems installed under those profiles will then be
  autoconfigured to use these repository mirrors in /etc/yum.repos.d, and if
  supported (Fedora Core 6 and later) these repositories can be leveraged even
  within Anaconda. This can be useful if (A) you have a large install base, (B)
  you want fast installation and upgrades for your systems, or (C) have some
  extra software not in a standard repository but want provisioned systems to
  know about that repository.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Make sure there is plenty of space in cobbler's webdir, which defaults to
  /var/www/cobbler.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>cobbler reposync [--tries=N] [--no-fail]</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Cobbler reposync is the command to use to update repos as configured with
  &quot;cobbler repo add&quot;. Mirroring can take a long time, and usage of
  cobbler reposync prior to usage is needed to ensure provisioned systems have
  the files they need to actually use the mirrored repositories. If you just add
  repos and never run &quot;cobbler reposync&quot;, the repos will never be
  mirrored. This is probably a command you would want to put on a crontab,
  though the frequency of that crontab and where the output goes is left up to
  the systems administrator.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For those familiar with yum's reposync, cobbler's reposync is (in most uses) a
  wrapper around the yum command. Please use &quot;cobbler reposync&quot; to
  update cobbler mirrors, as yum's reposync does not perform all required steps.
  Also cobbler adds support for rsync and SSH locations, where as yum's reposync
  only supports what yum supports (http/ftp).
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you ever want to update a certain repository you can run:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>cobbler reposync --only=&quot;reponame1&quot; ...</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
When updating repos by name, a repo will be updated even if it is set to be not
  updated during a regular reposync operation (ex: cobbler repo edit
  --name=reponame1 --keep-updated=0).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that if a cobbler import provides enough information to use the boot server
  as a yum mirror for core packages, cobbler can set up kickstarts to use the
  cobbler server as a mirror instead of the outside world. If this feature is
  desirable, it can be turned on by setting yum_post_install_mirror to 1 in
  /etc/settings ((and running &quot;cobbler sync&quot;). You should not use this
  feature if machines are provisioned on a different VLAN/network than
  production, or if you are provisioning laptops that will want to acquire
  updates on multiple networks.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The flags --tries=N (for example, --tries=3) and --no-fail should likely be used
  when putting reposync on a crontab. They ensure network glitches in one repo
  can be retried and also that a failure to synchronize one repo does not stop
  other repositories from being synchronized.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="PXE_BOOT_LOOP_PREVENTION"><a class="selflink" href="#PXE_BOOT_LOOP_PREVENTION">PXE
  BOOT LOOP PREVENTION</a></h2>
If you have your machines set to PXE first in the boot order (ahead of hard
  drives), change the &quot;pxe_just_once&quot; flag in /etc/cobbler/settings to
  1. This will set the machines to not PXE on successive boots once they
  complete one install. To re-enable PXE for a specific system, run the
  following command:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>cobbler system edit --name=name --netboot-enabled=1</b>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="KICKSTART_TRACKING"><a class="selflink" href="#KICKSTART_TRACKING">KICKSTART
  TRACKING</a></h2>
Cobbler knows how to keep track of the status of kickstarting machines.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>cobbler status</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Using the status command will show when cobbler thinks a machine started
  kickstarting and when it finished, provided the proper snippets are found in
  the kickstart template. This is a good way to track machines that may have
  gone interactive (or stalled/crashed) during kickstarts.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="IMAGES"><a class="selflink" href="#IMAGES">IMAGES</a></h2>
Cobbler can help with booting images physically and virtually, though the usage
  of these commands varies substantially by the type of image. Non-image based
  deployments are generally easier to work with and lead to more sustaintable
  infrastructure. Some manual use of other commands beyond of what is typically
  required of cobbler may be needed to prepare images for use with this feature.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="TRIGGERS"><a class="selflink" href="#TRIGGERS">TRIGGERS</a></h2>
Triggers provide a way to integrate cobbler with arbitrary 3rd party software
  without modifying cobbler's code. When adding a distro, profile, system, or
  repo, all scripts in /var/lib/cobbler/triggers/add are executed for the
  particular object type. Each particular file must be executable and it is
  executed with the name of the item being added as a parameter. Deletions work
  similarly -- delete triggers live in /var/lib/cobbler/triggers/delete. Order
  of execution is arbitrary, and cobbler does not ship with any triggers by
  default. There are also other kinds of triggers -- these are described on the
  Cobbler Wiki. For larger configurations, triggers should be written in Python
  -- in which case they are installed differently. This is also documented on
  the Wiki.

Cobbler also makes itself available as an XMLRPC API for use by higher level
  management software. Learn more at http://cobbler.github.io

  USER INTERFACE</a></h2>
Most of the day-to-day actions in cobbler's command line can be performed in
  Cobbler's Web UI. To enable and access the WebUI, see the following
  documentation:

<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="BOOT_CD"><a class="selflink" href="#BOOT_CD">BOOT
  CD</a></h2>
Cobbler can build all of it's profiles into a bootable CD image using the
  &quot;cobbler buildiso&quot; command. This allows for PXE-menu like bringup of
  bare metal in environments where PXE is not possible. Another more advanced
  method is described in the koan manpage, though this method is easier and
  sufficient for most applications.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="POWER_MANAGEMENT"><a class="selflink" href="#POWER_MANAGEMENT">POWER
  MANAGEMENT</a></h2>
Cobbler contains a power management feature that allows the user to associate
  system records in cobbler with the power management configuration attached to
  them. This can ease installation by making it easy to reassign systems to new
  operating systems and then reboot those systems. Read more about this feature
  at https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/wiki/Power-management
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="CONFIG_MANAGEMENT_INTEGRATION"><a class="selflink" href="#CONFIG_MANAGEMENT_INTEGRATION">CONFIG
  MANAGEMENT INTEGRATION</a></h2>
Cobbler contains features for integrating an installation environment with a
  configuration management system, which handles the configuration of the system
  after it is installed by allowing changes to configuration files and settings.
  You can read more about this feature at
  https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/wiki/Built-in-configuration-management and
  https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/wiki/Using-cobbler-with-a-configuration-management-system.
  Both features may be considered experimental as of time of the 1.4 release.
