<p>DRIFTNET(1) General Commands Manual DRIFTNET(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
driftnet - capture images from network traffic and display
them in an X window; optionally, capture audio streams and
play them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
driftnet [options] [filter code]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Driftnet watches network traffic, and picks out and displays
JPEG and GIF images for display. It is an horrific invasion
of privacy and shouldn&rsquo;t be used by anyone anywhere.
It <br>
has been described as &lsquo;a graphical tcpdump(8)&rsquo;,
&lsquo;EtherPeg for Unix&rsquo;, and called all sorts of
nasty names by people on Freshmeat. It is also possible to
use driftnet to capture <br>
MPEG audio data from the network and play it through a
player such as mpg123(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Images may be saved by clicking
on them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-h Print a summary of usage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Print additional details of
packets captured to the terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b Beep when a new image is
displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i interface <br>
Listen to packets on interface. By default, driftnet will
try to pick up traffic on all interfaces, but this does not
work with all versions of pcap(3); on such systems, <br>
an interface must be specified. On some systems, driftnet
can only use promiscuous mode if an interface is
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f file <br>
Instead of listening on an interface, read captured packets
from a pcap(3); dump file; file can be a named pipe for use
with Kismet or similar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p Do not put the interface into
promiscuous mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a Operate in &lsquo;adjunct
mode&rsquo;, where driftnet gathers images for use by
another program, such as Jamie Zawinski&rsquo;s webcollage.
In this mode, no window is displayed; images are <br>
captured and saved in a temporary directory, and their names
written on standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m number <br>
In adjunct mode, silently drop images if there are more than
number in the temporary directory. It is assumed that
another process will delete images which it has pro&acirc;
<br>
cessed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x prefix <br>
The filename prefix to use when saving images, by default
&lsquo;driftnet-&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d directory <br>
Use directory to store temporary files. Driftnet will clear
this directory of its own temporary files on exit, but will
not delete the directory or any other files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Attempt to capture streamed
audio data from the network, and either play it or, in
adjunct mode, save it in files. At present this only works
with MPEG data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S Capture streamed audio data
only, ignoring images.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M command <br>
Use the named command to play MPEG audio data. The command,
which is executed using the shell, should accept MPEG frames
on standard input. The default is &lsquo;mpg123
-&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">filter code <br>
Additional filter code to restrict the packets captured, in
the libpcap syntax. User filter code is evaluated as
&lsquo;tcp and (filter code)&rsquo;.</p>
