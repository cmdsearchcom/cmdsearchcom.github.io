texfot - run TeX, filtering online transcript for interesting messages
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
texfot [ <i>option</i>]... <i>texcmd</i> [<i>texarg</i>...]
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
&quot;texfot&quot; invokes <i>texcmd</i> with the given <i>texarg</i> arguments,
  filtering the online output for ``interesting'' messages. Its exit value is
  that of <i>texcmd</i>. Examples:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  # Sample basic invocation:
  texfot pdflatex file.tex
  
  # Ordinarily all output is copied to /tmp/fot before filtering;
  # that can be omitted:
  texfot pdflatex --tee=/dev/null file.tex
  
  # Example of more complex engine invocation:
  texfot lualatex --recorder '\nonstopmode\input file'
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Aside from its own options, described below, &quot;texfot&quot; just runs the
  given command with the given arguments (same approach to command line syntax
  as &quot;env&quot;, &quot;nice&quot;, &quot;time&quot;, &quot;timeout&quot;,
  etc.). Thus, &quot;texfot&quot; works with any engine and any command line
  options.
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;texfot&quot; does not look at the log file or any other possible output
  file(s); it only looks at the standard output and standard error from the
  command. stdout is processed first, then stderr. Lines from stderr have an
  identifying prefix. &quot;texfot&quot; writes all accepted lines to its
  stdout.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The messages shown are intended to be those which likely need action by the
  author: error messages, overfull and underfull boxes, undefined citations,
  missing characters from fonts, etc.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="FLOW_OF_OPERATION"><a class="selflink" href="#FLOW_OF_OPERATION">FLOW
  OF OPERATION</a></h1>
Here is the order in which lines of output are checked:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">1.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If the ``next line'' needs to be printed (see below), print
      it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">2.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Otherwise, if the line matches the built-in list of regexps
      to ignore, or any user-supplied list of regexps to ignore (given with
      &quot;--ignore&quot;, see below), in that order, ignore it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">3.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Otherwise, if the line matches the list of regexps for
      which the next line (two lines in all) should be shown, show this line and
      set the ``next line'' flag for the next time around the loop. Examples are
      the common &quot;!&quot; and &quot;filename:lineno:&quot; error messages,
      which are generally followed by a line with specific detail about the
      error.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">4.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Otherwise, if the line matches the list of regexps to show,
      show it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">5.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Otherwise, the default: if the line came from stdout,
      ignore it; if the line came from stderr, print it (to stdout). (This
      distinction is made because TeX engines write relatively few messages to
      stderr, and it's not unlikely that any such should be considered.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    It would be easy to add more options to allow for user additions to the
      various regex lists, if that ever seems useful. Or email me (see
    end).</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Once a particular check matches, the program moves on to process the next line.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Don't hesitate to peruse the source to the script, which is essentially a
  straightforward loop matching against the different lists as above. You can
  see the exact regexps being matched in the different categories in the source.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Incidentally, although nothing in this basic operation is specific to TeX
  engines, all the regular expressions included in the program are specific to
  TeX. So in practice the program isn't useful except with TeX engines, although
  it would be easy enough to adapt it (if there was anything else as verbose as
  TeX to make that useful).
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
The following are the options to &quot;texfot&quot; itself (not the TeX engine
  being invoked; consult the TeX documentation or the engine's
  &quot;--help&quot; output for that).
<div class="Pp"></div>
The first non-option terminates &quot;texfot&quot;'s option parsing, and the
  remainder of the command line is invoked as the TeX command, without further
  parsing. For example, &quot;texfot --debug tex --debug&quot; will output
  debugging information from both &quot;texfot&quot; and &quot;tex&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Options may start with either - or --, and may be unambiguously abbreviated. It
  is best to use the full option name in scripts, though, to avoid possible
  collisions with new options in the future.

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="RATIONALE"><a class="selflink" href="#RATIONALE">RATIONALE</a></h1>
I wrote this because, in my work as a TUGboat editor
  (&lt;http://tug.org/TUGboat&gt;, journal submissions always welcome!), I end
  up running and rerunning many papers, many times each. It was too easy to lose
  warnings I needed to see in the mass of unvarying and uninteresting output
  from TeX, such as style files being read and fonts being used. I wanted to see
  all and only those messages which needed some action by me.
<div class="Pp"></div>
I found some other programs of a similar nature, the LaTeX package
  &quot;silence&quot;, and plenty of other (La)TeX wrappers, but it seemed none
  of them did what I wanted. Either they read the log file (I wanted the online
  output only), or they output more or less than I wanted, or they required
  invoking TeX differently (I wanted to keep my build process exactly the same,
  most critically the TeX invocation, which can get complicated). Hence I wrote
  this.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Here are some keywords if you want to explore other options: texloganalyser,
  pydflatex, logfilter, latexmk, rubber, arara, and searching for
  &quot;log&quot; at &lt;http://ctan.org/search&gt;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;texfot&quot; is written in Perl, and runs on Unix, and does not work on
  Windows. (If by some chance anyone wants to use this program on Windows,
  please make your own fork; I'm not interested in supporting that os.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
The name comes from the &quot;trip.fot&quot; and &quot;trap.fot&quot; files that
  are part of Knuth's trip and trap torture tests, which record the online
  output from the programs. I am not sure what &quot;fot&quot; stands for in
  trip and trap, but I can pretend that it stands for &quot;filter online
  transcript&quot; in the present case&#x00A0;:).
