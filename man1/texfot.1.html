<p>TEXFOT(1) Karl Berry TEXFOT(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
texfot - run TeX, filtering online transcript for
interesting messages</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
texfot [option]... texcmd [texarg...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
&quot;texfot&quot; invokes texcmd with the given texarg
arguments, filtering the online output for
&lsquo;&lsquo;interesting&rsquo;&rsquo; messages. Its exit
value is that of texcmd. Examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Sample basic invocation: <br>
texfot pdflatex file.tex</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Ordinarily all output is
copied to /tmp/fot before filtering; <br>
# that can be omitted: <br>
texfot pdflatex --tee=/dev/null file.tex</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Example of more complex engine
invocation: <br>
texfot lualatex --recorder &rsquo;0nstopmodeinput
file&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Aside from its own options,
described below, &quot;texfot&quot; just runs the given
command with the given arguments (same approach to command
line syntax as &quot;env&quot;, &quot;nice&quot;,
&quot;time&quot;, <br>
&quot;timeout&quot;, etc.). Thus, &quot;texfot&quot; works
with any engine and any command line options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;texfot&quot; does not look
at the log file or any other possible output file(s); it
only looks at the standard output and standard error from
the command. stdout is processed first, <br>
then stderr. Lines from stderr have an identifying prefix.
&quot;texfot&quot; writes all accepted lines to its
stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The messages shown are intended
to be those which likely need action by the author: error
messages, overfull and underfull boxes, undefined citations,
missing characters from <br>
fonts, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FLOW OF OPERATION <br>
Here is the order in which lines of output are checked:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. If the &lsquo;&lsquo;next
line&rsquo;&rsquo; needs to be printed (see below), print
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Otherwise, if the line
matches the built-in list of regexps to ignore, or any
user-supplied list of regexps to ignore (given with
&quot;--ignore&quot;, see below), in that order, <br>
ignore it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. Otherwise, if the line
matches the list of regexps for which the next line (two
lines in all) should be shown, show this line and set the
&lsquo;&lsquo;next line&rsquo;&rsquo; flag for the next time
<br>
around the loop. Examples are the common &quot;!&quot; and
&quot;filename:lineno:&quot; error messages, which are
generally followed by a line with specific detail about the
error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. Otherwise, if the line
matches the list of regexps to show, show it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5. Otherwise, the default: if
the line came from stdout, ignore it; if the line came from
stderr, print it (to stdout). (This distinction is made
because TeX engines write <br>
relatively few messages to stderr, and it&rsquo;s not
unlikely that any such should be considered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It would be easy to add more
options to allow for user additions to the various regex
lists, if that ever seems useful. Or email me (see end).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once a particular check matches,
the program moves on to process the next line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Don&rsquo;t hesitate to peruse
the source to the script, which is essentially a
straightforward loop matching against the different lists as
above. You can see the exact regexps being <br>
matched in the different categories in the source.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Incidentally, although nothing
in this basic operation is specific to TeX engines, all the
regular expressions included in the program are specific to
TeX. So in practice the <br>
program isn&rsquo;t useful except with TeX engines, although
it would be easy enough to adapt it (if there was anything
else as verbose as TeX to make that useful).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The following are the options to &quot;texfot&quot; itself
(not the TeX engine being invoked; consult the TeX
documentation or the engine&rsquo;s &quot;--help&quot;
output for that).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first non-option terminates
&quot;texfot&quot;&rsquo;s option parsing, and the remainder
of the command line is invoked as the TeX command, without
further parsing. For example, &quot;texfot <br>
--debug tex --debug&quot; will output debugging information
from both &quot;texfot&quot; and &quot;tex&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options may start with either -
or --, and may be unambiguously abbreviated. It is best to
use the full option name in scripts, though, to avoid
possible collisions with new <br>
options in the future.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;--debug&quot; <br>
&quot;--no-debug&quot; <br>
Output (or not) what is being done on standard error. Off by
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;--ignore&quot; regexp <br>
Ignore lines in the TeX output matching (Perl) regexp. Can
be repeated. Adds to the default set of ignore regexps
rather than replacing. These regexps are not <br>
automatically anchored (or otherwise altered), simply used
as-is.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;--interactive&quot; <br>
&quot;--no-interactive&quot; <br>
By default, standard input to the TeX process is closed so
that TeX&rsquo;s interactive mode (waiting for input upon
error, the &quot;*&quot; prompt, etc.) is never entered.
Giving <br>
&quot;--interactive&quot; allows interaction to happen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;--quiet&quot; <br>
&quot;--no-quiet&quot; <br>
By default, the TeX command being invoked is reported on
standard output. &quot;--quiet&quot; omits that
reporting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;--stderr&quot; <br>
&quot;--no-stderr&quot; <br>
The default is for &quot;texfot&quot; to report everything
written to stderr by the TeX command (on stdout).
&quot;--no-stderr&quot; omits that reporting. (Some
programs, &quot;dvisvgm&quot; is one, can <br>
be rather verbose on stderr.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;--tee&quot; file <br>
By default, the output being filtered is &quot;tee&quot;-ed,
before filtering, to &quot;$TMPDIR/fot&quot;
(&quot;/tmp/fot&quot; if &quot;TMPDIR&quot; is not set), to
make it easy to check the full output when the <br>
filtering seems suspect. This option allows specifying a
different file. Use &quot;--tee /dev/null&quot; if you
don&rsquo;t want the original output at all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;--version&quot; <br>
Output version information and exit successfully.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;--help&quot; <br>
Display this help and exit successfully.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RATIONALE <br>
I wrote this because, in my work as a TUGboat editor
(&lt;http://tug.org/TUGboat&gt;, journal submissions always
welcome!), I end up running and rerunning many papers, many
times each. <br>
It was too easy to lose warnings I needed to see in the mass
of unvarying and uninteresting output from TeX, such as
style files being read and fonts being used. I wanted to see
<br>
all and only those messages which needed some action by
me.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">I found some other programs of a
similar nature, the LaTeX package &quot;silence&quot;, and
plenty of other (La)TeX wrappers, but it seemed none of them
did what I wanted. Either they <br>
read the log file (I wanted the online output only), or they
output more or less than I wanted, or they required invoking
TeX differently (I wanted to keep my build process <br>
exactly the same, most critically the TeX invocation, which
can get complicated). Hence I wrote this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here are some keywords if you
want to explore other options: texloganalyser, pydflatex,
logfilter, latexmk, rubber, arara, and searching for
&quot;log&quot; at &lt;http://ctan.org/search&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;texfot&quot; is written in
Perl, and runs on Unix, and does not work on Windows. (If by
some chance anyone wants to use this program on Windows,
please make your own fork; I&rsquo;m not <br>
interested in supporting that os.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The name comes from the
&quot;trip.fot&quot; and &quot;trap.fot&quot; files that are
part of Knuth&rsquo;s trip and trap torture tests, which
record the online output from the programs. I am not sure
<br>
what &quot;fot&quot; stands for in trip and trap, but I can
pretend that it stands for &quot;filter online
transcript&quot; in the present case :).</p>
