<p>CDV(1) General Commands Manual CDV(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
cdv - codeville command line client tool</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
cdv command [options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
cdv is a client for codeville, a distributed version control
system. It aims to perform the same job as SVN, CVS, RCS,
arch, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMAND OVERVIEW <br>
add &lt;files&gt; <br>
Add new files to the repository. All files must be added
before they will be part of the version control system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">commit [-b] [-m
&quot;&lt;comment&gt;&quot;] [-n] <br>
Commits all changes made to the repository since the last
commit. A comment is required for every commit. It may
either be supplied via the -m option for simple comments
<br>
or if the -m option is omitted, whatever editor is specified
in the EDITOR environment variable will be launched. If no
editor is specified, vi is the default in all unixy <br>
environments (including OS X and cygwin) and Notepad is the
default in Windows. In the editor, a comment may be added at
the top, and file changes which the user does not <br>
wish to have in a given changeset can be removed by deleting
them from the &quot;### files&quot; list at the bottom
(although merging cannot be avoided through deleting things
from <br>
the &quot;### merge files&quot; list). Every commit creates
a changeset. If there are changes since the last update,
files will be merged. In the event of unresolved conflicts,
the <br>
user will be prompted to resolve them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n used to commit changes
off-line. Changes committed off-line can still be used with
all commands, but are not visible to other users until an
on-line commit is done.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b forces commit to not make a
new changeset. This will commit changes which have already
been committed locally via -n (or as a result of having
multiple repositories <br>
involved), but will not create a new changeset for existing
file modifications. This is especially needed for committing
to back-up servers (servers started with -b) as it <br>
is the only way to commit changes to a back-up server. This
is not the recommended way to commit changes to normal
servers. In general, if one wishes to commit changes <br>
committed offline without committing new changes, one should
commit and changeset with all the files in the
&quot;&quot;### files&quot;&quot; list removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">construct &lt;changeset&gt; <br>
Recreates the repository at the given changeset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">create &lt;repository name&gt;
<br>
Creates a new repository with the appropriate name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">describe [-x|-d] [-s]
&lt;changeset&gt; <br>
Gives the description of the changeset including the long
name of the change, the user who made the change, that date
it was made, the comment, the relation it has to <br>
other changesets, and what files were modified and in what
manner they were modified (i.e. added, modified, renamed, or
deleted).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s gives a short description</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d does a diff</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x displays an XML version of
the output. This is not compatible with displaying a diff.
This can only be used with parenthesized changesets from the
file history. It&rsquo;s <br>
sort of a hack right now, really.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">destroy &lt;repository&gt; <br>
Destroys a repository. The opposite of create.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">diff [-r &lt;changeset&gt; [-r
&lt;changeset&gt;] ] [&lt;files&gt;] <br>
Does a diff between different versions of each of given
files. If no files are specified, all relevant files are
shown. The first -r option indicates which changeset the
<br>
diff should be from, the second which it should be to. If no
changesets are specified, it shows the difference between
the last known state of the repository and the cur&acirc;
<br>
rent client state.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">edit &lt;files&gt; <br>
Enables editing a file. When not in edit-mode, this is
unnecessary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">heads Lists the root nodes in
the graph of changesets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">history [-h &lt;changeset&gt;]
[-n &lt;number&gt;] [-s &lt;skip count&gt;] [-v]
[&lt;files&gt;] <br>
Gives the history of the repository or of the files
specified. Specifically, it lists all relevant change sets
by short name, user, date, and comment in most recent first
<br>
order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n limits the number of changes
printed to the given number</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h causes it to print the
history starting at the given changeset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s skips the first &lt;skip
count&gt; changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v causes it to print the
changes verbosely which includes additional information
about each changeset which affected the files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">init Initialize a new client
with the current directory as the root. Specify a directory
other than current one by using the top level -p switch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">is_ancestor &lt;changeset1&gt;
&lt;changeset2&gt; <br>
Tells whether or not &lt;changeset1&gt; is an ancestor of
&lt;changeset2&gt;. Note that it is possible for neither
changeset to be an ancestor of the other.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">last-modified &lt;file&gt; <br>
Returns the last changeset which modified a given file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list-repos <br>
Lists all the repositories on the same server as the
repository you are in.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">password <br>
Change your password.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print_dag [-h &lt;changeset&gt;]
[-h &lt;changeset&gt;] [...] &lt;file&gt; <br>
Prints the directed acyclic graph which shows the changesets
which have been applied to a file and their
relationships.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Changesets specified with -h are
treated as head nodes for the graph (i.e. later changesets
are excluded).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print_history
[&lt;changeset&gt;] <br>
Prints the directed acylcic graph of the the entire history.
Starts at the given changeset, if provided.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rebuild <br>
Recreates all of the metadata from the static history. This
should generally only be done when instructed to by software
upgrade instructions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">remove &lt;files&gt; <br>
Deletes files from the repository.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rename &lt;file&gt;
&lt;newname&gt; <br>
Moves or renames files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">revert [-a] &lt;files&gt; <br>
Reverts any local changes to the file. At this time only
changes to the content of the file can be reverted. The
ability to revert adds, deletes, and renames will be
com&acirc; <br>
ing in the future.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is a subtle difference in
the definition of revert from what you might expect. It does
not guarantee that it will restore the file to some previous
state. For exam&acirc; <br>
ple, if you are in the middle of a merge and call revert on
a file, it will be regenerated by running the merge. If the
file were modified prior to running the merge <br>
update, the file contents will now be different from anytime
in the past.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Revert should be thought of as
throwing away uncommitted changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a indicates files should only
be reverted if they have not been modified. Basically
unmarks them as open for edit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set &lt;variable&gt;
&lt;value&gt; <br>
Sets a Codeville variable to a given value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">show-vars <br>
Show a list of all Codeville variables and what they are set
to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">status [-v] <br>
Shows changes not yet committed to the repository in
brief.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v gives more verbose status
which includes mention of files which are in the directory
space, but not in the repository and files missing from the
directory space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unset &lt;variable&gt; <br>
Removes a Codeville variable so that it no longer has any
setting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">update [-d] <br>
Gets all changes made to the repository since the last time
you did an update. Files will be merged as necessary. In the
event of unresolved conflicts, the user will be <br>
asked to resolve them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d pull in changesets but do not
merge them. Has no effect on the workspace state. This
allows a user to browse and diff changesets without having
to merge.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SPECIFYING FILES <br>
Files can be specified using bash-style wildcards on any
platform. In addition, &rsquo;...&rsquo; behaves like a find
command, expanding all files and directories within
subdirectories. <br>
General notes:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Flags are listed in no
particular order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All printed graphs are output in
a format intended to be run through graphviz tools&rsquo;
&quot;dot&quot; tool.</p>
