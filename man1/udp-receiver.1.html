<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
&quot;Udp-receiver&quot; is used to receive files sent by
&quot;udp-sender&quot; (for instance a disk image).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Basic options <br>
--file file <br>
Writes received data to file. If this parameter is not
supplied, received data is written to stdout instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--pipe command <br>
Sends data through pipe after receiving it. This is useful
for decompressing the data, or for filling in unused
filesystem blocks that may have been stripped out by udp-
<br>
sender. The command gets a direct handle on the output file
or device, and thus may seek inside it, if needed.
&quot;Udpcast&quot; itself also keeps a handle on the file,
which is used <br>
for an informational progress display. The command&rsquo;s
stdin is a pipe from udp-receiver. Example:
&quot;udp-receiver -p &quot;gzip -dc&quot;&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--log file <br>
Logs some stuff into file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--nosync <br>
Do not open target in synchronous mode. This is the default
when writing to a file or a pipe.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--sync <br>
Write to target in synchronous mode. This is the default
when writing to a device (character or block)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--nokbd <br>
Do not read start signal from keyboard, and do not display
any message telling the user to press any key to start.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--start-timeout sec <br>
receiver aborts at start if it doesn&rsquo;t see a sender
within this many seconds. Furthermore, the sender needs to
start transmission of data within this delay. Once
transmission <br>
is started, the timeout no longer applies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--receive-timeout sec <br>
receiver aborts during transmission if it doesn&rsquo;t see
a packet from the sender within this many seconds. This
timeout only applies once transmission has started.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Networking options <br>
--portbase portbase <br>
Default ports to use for udpcast. Two ports are used:
portbase and portbase+1 . Thus, Portbase must be even.
Default is 9000. The same portbase must be specified for
both <br>
&quot;udp-sender&quot; and &quot;udp-receiver&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--interface interface <br>
Network interface used to send out the data. Default is
&quot;eth0&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ttl ttl <br>
Time to live for connection request packet (by default
connection request is broadcast to the LAN&rsquo;s broadcast
address. If ttl is set, the connection request is multicast
<br>
instead to 224.0.0.1 with the given ttl, which should enable
udpcast to work between LANs. Not tested though.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--mcast-rdv-address address <br>
Uses a non-standard multicast address for the control
connection (which is used by the sender and receivers to
&quot;find&quot; each other). This is not the address that
is used to <br>
transfer the data. By default &quot;mcast-rdv-address&quot;
is the Ethernet broadcast address if &quot;ttl&quot; is 1,
and 224.0.0.1 otherwise. This setting should not be used
except in very <br>
special situations, such as when 224.0.0.1 cannot be used
for policy reasons.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--exit-wait milliseconds <br>
When transmission is over, receiver will wait for this time
after receiving the final REQACK. This is done in order to
guard against loss of the final ACK. Is 500 <br>
milliseconds by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ignore-lost-data <br>
Do not stop reception when data loss is detected, but
instead fill with random data. This is useful for multimedia
transmission where 100% integrity is not need.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Statistics options <br>
--stat-period seconds <br>
Every so much milliseconds, print some statistics to stderr:
how much bytes received so far log, position in uncompressed
file (if applicable), overall bitrate... By default, <br>
this is printed every half second.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--print-uncompressed-position
flag <br>
By default, udp-receiver only prints the position in
uncompressed file if the 2 following conditions are met:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Output is piped
via a compressor (&quot;-p &quot; option).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The final output
is seekable (file or device)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With the
&quot;--print-uncompressed-position&quot;, options, you can
change this behavior:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If flag is 0,
uncompressed position will never be printed, even if above
conditions are met</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If flag is 1,
uncompressed position will always be printed, even if above
conditions are not met</p>
