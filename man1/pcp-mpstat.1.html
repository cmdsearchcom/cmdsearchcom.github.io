<p>PCP-MPSTAT(1) General Commands Manual PCP-MPSTAT(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pcp-mpstat - Report CPU and Interrupt related
statistics.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pcp mpstat [ -A ] [ -u ] [ -V ] [ -I { SUM | CPU | SCPU |
ALL } ] [ -P { cpu1,cpu2 [,...] | ON | ALL } ] [ -t interval
] [ -s count ] [ -a pcp-archive ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The pcp mpstat command writes to standard output activities
for each available processor, processor 0 being the first
one. If no activity/option has been selected, then the <br>
default report is the CPU utilization [ -u ] report.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The interval parameter specifies
the amount of time in seconds between each report. Default
is one second. The value of count parameter determines the
number of samples to be <br>
displayed. Default is continous.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-A This option is equivalent to specifying -u -I ALL -P
ALL</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I { SUM | CPU | SCPU | ALL }
<br>
Report interrupts statistics.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With the SUM keyword, the pcp
mpstat command reports the total number of interrupts per
processor. The following values are displayed:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CPU <br>
Processor number. The keyword all indicates that statistics
are calculated as averages among all processors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">intr/s <br>
Show the total number of interrupts received per second by
the CPU or CPUs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With the CPU keyword, the number
of each individual interrupt received per second by the CPU
or CPUs is displayed. Interrupts are those under the
kernel.percpu.interrupts <br>
metric tree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With the SCPU keyword, the
number of each individual software interrupt received per
second by the CPU or CPUs is displayed. Software interrupts
are those under <br>
the kernel.percpu.softirqs tree</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ALL keyword is equivalent to
specifying all the keywords above and therefore all the
interrupts statistics are displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P { cpu1,cpu2[,...] | ON | ALL
} <br>
Indicate the processor number for which statistics are to be
reported. cpu1 and cpu2 are the processor numbers. A list of
required processor numbers can be provided. Note <br>
that processor 0 is the first processor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ON keyword indicates that
statistics are to be reported for every online processor,
whereas the ALL keyword indicates that statistics are to be
reported for all pro&acirc; <br>
cessors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u Report CPU utilization. The
following values are displayed:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CPU <br>
Processor number. The keyword ALL indicates that statistics
are calculated as averages among all processors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%usr <br>
Show the percentage of CPU utilization that occurred while
executing at the user level (application).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%nice <br>
Show the percentage of CPU utilization that occurred while
executing at the user level with nice priority.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%sys <br>
Show the percentage of CPU utilization that occurred while
executing at the system level (kernel). Note that this does
not include time spent servicing hardware and <br>
software interrupts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%iowait <br>
Show the percentage of time that the CPU or CPUs were idle
during which the system had an outstanding disk I/O
request.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%irq <br>
Show the percentage of time spent by the CPU or CPUs to
service hardware interrupts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%soft <br>
Show the percentage of time spent by the CPU or CPUs to
service software interrupts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%steal <br>
Show the percentage of time spent in involuntary wait by the
virtual CPU or CPUs while the hypervisor was servicing
another virtual processor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%guest <br>
Show the percentage of time spent by the CPU or CPUs to run
a virtual processor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%gnice <br>
Show the percentage of time spent by the CPU or CPUs to run
a niced guest.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%idle <br>
Show the percentage of time that the CPU or CPUs were idle
and the system did not have an outstanding disk I/O
request.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: On SMP machines a
processor that does not have any activity at all is a
disabled (offline) processor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a FILE , --archive = FILE <br>
Causes pcp-mpstat to use the specified archive than
connecting to PMCD. The argument to -a is a comma-separated
list of names, each of which may be the base name of an
ar&acirc; <br>
chive or the name of a directory containing one or more
archives. Archives can be created using pmlogger(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s N , --samples = N <br>
Set the number of samples to be displayed. Since the first
sample is used for the rate conversion of some of the
metrics, the total number of samples reported are one less
<br>
that N. Default is continous.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t DELTA , --interval = DELTA
<br>
Set the interval between two samples. Default is one
second.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Print version number then
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
pcp mpstat -t 2 -s 5 <br>
Display four reports of global statistics among all
processors at two second intervals.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pcp mpstat -P ALL -t 2 -s 5 <br>
Display four reports of statistics for all processors at two
second intervals.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
pcp-mpstat is inspired by the mpstat(1) command and aims to
be command line and output compatible with it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
TZ and LC_TIME environment variables can be used to override
the default date display format for pcp-mpstat.</p>
