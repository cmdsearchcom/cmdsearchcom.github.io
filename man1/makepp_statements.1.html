<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
makepp_statements -- Various statements in a makefile</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
A: autoload, B: build_cache, <br>

&quot;sub&quot;, V: vpath</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A statement is any line
beginning with a word which does not have a &quot;:&quot; in
it. (A colon implies that the line is a rule.) For example,
these are statements:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">include extra_rules.mk <br>
load_makefile subdir</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Makepp has a number of builtin
statements which you may occasionally need to use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that wherever you see an
underscore, you may also use a dash, because makepp converts
dashes to underscores in statement names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Conditionals <br>
Conditionals are special statements, which control what
lines of the Makeppfile are actually seen. The simplest form
(where &quot;ifxxx&quot; stands for any of the conditional
statements <br>
documented below) is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ifxxx ... <br>
lines seen if the statement evaluates as true <br>
endif</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ifxxx ... <br>
lines seen if the statement evaluates as true <br>
else <br>
lines seen if the statement evaluates as false <br>
endif</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is also the possibility to
do complex combinations like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ifxxx ... <br>
and ifxxx ... <br>
and ifxxx ... <br>
or ifxxx ... <br>
and ifxxx ... <br>
lines seen if the combined statements evaluate as true <br>
else ifxxx ... <br>
or ifxxx ... <br>
and ifxxx ... <br>
lines seen if the first combination evaluates as false <br>
and these combined statements evaluate as true <br>
else <br>
lines seen if the statements above evaluate as false <br>
endif</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As is suggested by the
indentation, &quot;and&quot; has higher precedence than
&quot;or&quot;. In other words an &quot;or&quot; elects
between two groups of &quot;and&quot;&lsquo;s. There may be
any number of &quot;and <br>
ifxxx&quot;&lsquo;s, &quot;or ifxxx&quot;&lsquo;s and
&quot;else ifxxx&quot;&lsquo;s.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;ifxxx&quot;
conditional statements are unique in that they may occur in
the middle of rule actions, as in the above example, without
disrupting the rule.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ifeq string1, string2 <br>
ifneq string1, string2 <br>
ifeq ($(STR1),$(STR2)) <br>
makefile lines if true <br>
else <br>
makefile lines if false <br>
endif</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the two strings match exactly
(except for leading or trailing whitespace), then the first
set of lines is used; otherwise the second is used. The else
clause is optional.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are two other acceptable
syntaxes for the &quot;ifeq&quot; and &quot;ifneq&quot;
statements:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ifeq string1, string2 <br>
ifeq string1 string2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">which are equivalent. Of course
you can quote the strings as needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;ifeq&quot; and its friends
&quot;ifneq&quot;, &quot;ifdef&quot;, &quot;ifndef&quot;,
&quot;ifperl&quot;, &quot;ifmakeperl&quot;,
&quot;ifsys&quot; and &quot;iftrue&quot; are primarily
useful when you have to build a program under several
different <br>
conditions. For example,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUILD_TYPE := debug #
&quot;debug&quot; or &quot;production&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ifeq ($(BUILD_TYPE), debug) <br>
CFLAGS := -g <br>
else <br>
CFLAGS := -O2 <br>
endif</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">program : *.o <br>
$(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(inputs) -o $(output) $(LIBS) <br>
ifeq ($(BUILD_TYPE), production) <br>
strip $(output) <br>
endif</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%.o : %.c <br>
$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c $(input) -o $(output)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this is a production build,
all files are compiled with the &quot;-O2&quot; option
instead of the &quot;-g&quot; option. Furthermore, the
program &quot;strip&quot; is run on the resulting binary (in
<br>
case you happened to link with some libraries that were
compiled in debug mode).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sometimes it is easier to use
the &quot;$(if)&quot; function or &quot;$(perl)&quot;
function function instead of a &quot;ifeq&quot;
statement.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you just want to see whether
a symbol is blank or not, you only need to supply a single
argument, like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ifneq $(EXE_SUFFIX) <br>
# what to do if $(EXE_SUFFIX) is not blank <br>
endif</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ifdef VARIABLE ... <br>
ifndef VARIABLE ... <br>
These statements work analogously to the &quot;ifeq&quot;
and &quot;ifneq&quot; statements, except that they test
whether any of the variables is defined or not any is (i.e.
none is defined). A <br>
variable is defined if:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; It was given a
value with an assignment earlier in the makefile. See
makepp_variables for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; It was given a
value as a Perl variable in a &quot;perl_begin&quot;
block.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The variable is
present in the environment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The variable is
present on the command line, e.g., to invoke your makefile,
you typed</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">makepp CFLAGS=-O2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ifndef CFLAGS <br>
CFLAGS := -g <br>
endif</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In this case, &quot;CFLAGS&quot;
is set to &quot;-g&quot; only if it wasn&rsquo;t already
defined. Note that this statement could just as easily have
been written using the &quot;?=&quot; assignment, like <br>
this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CFLAGS ?= -g</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ifperl perlcode <br>
ifmakeperl perlcode <br>
These statements work analogously to the &quot;ifeq&quot;
and &quot;ifneq&quot; statements, except that the tests are
in Perl. The first variant is plain Perl code, while the
second variant <br>
first passes the statement through Make-style variable
expansion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VERSION := 3.0 <br>
# VERSION is automatically also a Perl variable: <br>
ifperl $VERSION &lt;= 2 <br>
CPPFLAGS := -DNEW <br>
endif <br>
# quotes necessary for CFLAGS, because Perl sees only the
value: <br>
ifmakeperl my $$x = &rsquo;$(CFLAGS)&rsquo;; $$x =~ /-g/
<br>
CFLAGS := -g -O2 <br>
endif</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ifsys wildcard ... <br>
ifnsys wildcard ... <br>
Tests if the current system makepp is running on matches any
of the wildcards or not any (i.e. none).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ifsys i[3-6]86 <br>
and ifsys Linux SunOS <br>
... # An Intel platform with Linux or Solaris <br>
else ifnsys sparc power* <br>
... # Nor Sparc or PowerPC <br>
endif</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are up to six different
strings you can match against. The actual strings are not
standardized. Three of them reflect what the Perl instance
was built for (not <br>
necessarily the same as where it is running), and the others
come from the system and all vary wildly in form. You can
find all of what the current platform matches by <br>
typing the following command at the Shell:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perl -MConfig -e&rsquo;print
&quot;$^O @Config{qw(archname myarchname)} &quot;&rsquo;;
uname -mps</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">iftrue expression <br>
ifntrue expression <br>
Tests if the expression evaluates to some value other than
zero or the empty string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other Multiline Statements <br>
Conditionals may control a whole multiline statement, but
they cannot be inside such a statement.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">define <br>
{export|global|override}* define <br>
define VARIABLE [assignment-operator] <br>
variable value line 1 <br>
variable value line 2 <br>
endef</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Defines $(VARIABLE)&rsquo;s
value to be all the lines between the &quot;define&quot;
statement and the &quot;endef&quot; statement. See multiline
variables. The keywords &quot;export&quot; and
&quot;global&quot; may <br>
not be given at the same time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perl_begin <br>
This is the same as &quot;perl&quot;, but using GNU make
style statement syntax. This statement introduces a block of
code which is interpreted verbatim by perl. It can be useful
for <br>
defining functions, but you can do this more concisely with
the &quot;sub&quot; statement. A block of Perl code in your
makefile can be useful to perform actions that are easier in
<br>
Perl than with makepp functions and rules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The remainder of the line
following the &quot;perl_begin&quot; statement is ignored.
All text up until a line that begins at the left margin with
&quot;perl_end&quot; is sent verbatim to the <br>
perl interpreter. There can be no spaces before
&quot;perl_end&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One example that I use this for
is to make directories that might not necessarily exist.
It&rsquo;s common in makefiles to put all the .o files in a
subdirectory (e.g., a <br>
directory with a name i386, or sparc, or something that
depends on the machine type). But what if the directory does
not exist yet? You can make each .o file depend on the <br>
subdirectory, and put a rule in to build the subdirectory.
But it&rsquo;s a lot easier just to do this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OBJDIR := $(ARCH) # Where we put
.o files. <br>
perl_begin <br>
-d $OBJDIR or mkdir $OBJDIR; # Make sure the directory
exists. <br>
perl_end</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This way, every time the
makefile is run, the subdirectory will be created if it does
not exist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some operations are better
expressed in terms of regular expressions than
makepp&rsquo;s text functions. For example,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perl_begin <br>
if ($ARCH =~ /^i[56]86/) { # You could do this with: ifsys
i[56]86 <br>
$CFLAGS = &rsquo;-O6 -malign-double&rsquo;; # On intel
machines &gt; 486, there <br>
# is a substantial speed penalty <br>
# for doubles that aren&rsquo;t quadword <br>
# aligned. <br>
} else { <br>
$CFLAGS = &rsquo;-O6&rsquo;; <br>
} <br>
perl_end</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%.o: %.c <br>
$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c $(input) -o $(output)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any make variable can be
accessed directly as a Perl scalar. In this case,
we&rsquo;ve set the value of &quot;CFLAGS&quot; differently
based on a regular expression match on the <br>
architecture flags.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As a final example, some pieces
of information are easier to access directly from Perl than
from makepp. For example, you can access all of the
configuration information <br>
that perl knows about your system, including how to build
shared libraries, etc. (Type &quot;perldoc Config&quot; if
you want to see what configuration information Perl has <br>
available.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perl_begin</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use Config;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ARCH =
$Config{&rsquo;archname&rsquo;}; # Use perl&rsquo;s
knowledge of the architecture. <br>
$CC = $Config{&rsquo;cc&rsquo;}; # Use the same C compiler
as Perl did. <br>
$SHARED_OBJ_CFLAGS = $Config{&rsquo;cccdlflags&rsquo;}; <br>
# Flags needed to compile objects which will <br>
# go into a shared library. <br>
$SHARED_OBJ_LDFLAGS = $Config{&rsquo;ccdlflags&rsquo;} .
&quot; &quot; . $Config{&rsquo;lddlflags&rsquo;}; <br>
# Linker flags to make a shared library. <br>
$SHARED_CC_LINK = $Config{&rsquo;ld&rsquo;}; # Command to
produce shared libraries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$SHARED_EXTENSION =
$Config{&rsquo;dlext&rsquo;}; # Extension of shared
libraries. <br>
perl_end</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%.o: %.c <br>
$(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(SHARED_OBJ_CFLAGS) -c $(input) -o
$(output)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">libmylib.$(DLEXT): *.o <br>
$(SHARED_CC_LINK) $(inputs) -o $(output)
$(SHARED_OBJ_LDFLAGS)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note how we define a bunch of
variables in the Perl block, and then we use them afterwards
in the rest of the makefile. You can use the full power of
the perl interpreter to <br>
set your variables in arbitrarily complicated ways. You can
run shell commands from your Perl code, access a database,
or whatever you want.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perl perlcode <br>
makeperl perlcode <br>
This is the same as &quot;perl_begin&quot;, but using
Perl-style braces. The first variant is plain Perl code,
while the second variant first passes the statement through
Make-style <br>
variable expansion. Note that the difficulty of parsing
Perl&rsquo;s braces has lead to the following simple
heuristic:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If a double
opening brace is found on the same or next line, a double
closing brace will terminate the block. It must be at the
beginning of a line, but may be preceded <br>
by whitespace.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Else, if the
closing brace is at the very end of the &quot;perl&quot;
line this is a one liner.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Otherwise the
closing brace must be at the very beginning of a following
line, i.e. no leading whitespace.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For an efficient way to call
Perl scripts, see &quot;run&quot;. Unlike the
&quot;$(perl)&quot; function, the return value of this block
is ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perl { print &quot;passed this
point in the makefile0 }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perl <br>
{ <br>
print &quot;and this one too0; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ifdef NOISY <br>
perl {{ <br>
print &quot;as well as this one0 <br>
}} <br>
endif</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can use the Perl debugger
for your embedded code, by running makepp itself in the
debugger, where ... are the arguments, if any, you normally
pass:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perl -d -S mpp ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is hard to set breakpoints in
Perl code that has not been loaded. You can work around this
by putting this line into your embedded Perl, just before
where you want to <br>
break:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$DB::single = 1;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Then you can type &quot;c&quot;
at the debugger&rsquo;s prompt, to continue till that
point.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sub <br>
makesub <br>
This statement provides a way to define a Perl subroutine
inside your makefile. The first variant is plain Perl code,
while the second variant first passes the statement <br>
through Make-style variable expansion. The syntax is
identical to that of the Perl sub statement, except that
prototypes are meaningless.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For the three possibilities of
putting the braces of the body, see the explanation at the
&quot;perl&quot; statement.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A Perl subroutine is invoked
whenever a statement is seen, or when an expression like
&quot;$(name words)&quot; is seen. For example, suppose that
for some reason you need to load the <br>
contents of a file into a make variable. (You could do this
by saying &quot;$(shell cat filename)&quot; but it&rsquo;s
possible to do it without ever invoking the shell.) This can
be done <br>
by placing the following into your makefile:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sub f_file_contents { <br>
my ($file) = @_; # Name the argument. <br>
open my $fh, $file or die &quot;$file: $!0; <br>
local $/ = undef; # Slurp file in one read. <br>
&lt;$fh&gt;; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ifdef NEWSUB <br>
makesub f_VAR2 <br>
{{ <br>
$(VAR) * 2; <br>
}} <br>
endif</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">makesub f_VAR1 { $(VAR) + 1
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Now, with this function defined,
you can write</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">X = $(file_contents filename) #
equivalent to builtin $(&amp;cat filename)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and the variable
&quot;$(X)&quot; will fetch the contents of the given file
every time it gets expanded. Use &quot;:=&quot; to do this
exactly once, or &quot;;=&quot; to do this at most once.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See makepp_extending for more
details and examples.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Simple Statements <br>
autoload filename ... <br>
Specifies one or more makefiles to load should an attempt to
find a rule for a file in this directory otherwise fail.
This is useful when the makefile has rules whose <br>
definitions depend (possibly indirectly) on a file in
another directory that depends (possibly indirectly) on
other files in this directory (built by rules that do not
depend <br>
on the file in the other directory).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, your Makeppfile
might look like this:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">rules-to-build-files-that-otherdir/x-depends-on</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">more_rules.makeppfile:
otherdir/x <br>
action-to-build-more_rules.makeppfile</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">autoload
more_rules.makeppfile</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that we cannot reliably
replace &quot;autoload&quot; with &quot;include&quot; here,
because if something other than the rule for
more_rules.makeppfile tries to build otherdir/x first, then
<br>
more_rules.makeppfile will probably fail because otherdir/x
won&rsquo;t exist yet, because there is already an attempt
to build it underway when Makeppfile is implicitly loaded on
<br>
its behalf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WARNING: Be very careful about
doing things in an autoloaded makefile that change the
behavior of rules in the directory&rsquo;s other
makefile(s), as this will cause that behavior <br>
to depend on whether or not some previously built target
caused makefiles to be autoloaded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">build_cache /path/to/build/cache
<br>
[global] build_cache /path/to/build/cache <br>
Specifies a path to a build cache. See makepp_build_cache
for details. The build cache must already exist; see
&quot;How to manage a build cache&quot; in
makepp_build_cache for how <br>
to make it in the first place. A &quot;build_cache&quot;
statement in a makefile overrides the
&quot;--build-cache&quot; command line option for rules in
the makefile, but it may be overridden <br>
by the &quot;:build_cache&quot; rule modifier on a per-rule
basis.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The keyword &quot;global&quot;
may precede this statement with the same effect as the
command line option, i.e. the build cache applies in every
makefile. This should best be given in <br>
a RootMakeppfile to be certain it is seen early enough.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specify &quot;none&quot; instead
of a path to a directory if you want to disable the build
cache for all rules in this makefile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">build_check build_check_method
<br>
[global] build_check build_check_method <br>
Specifies the default build check method for all rules in
this makefile. See makepp_build_check for details. The
&quot;build_check&quot; statement overrides the <br>
&quot;--build-check-method&quot; command line option for all
rules in the makefile, but may be overridden by the
&quot;:build_check&quot; modifier on a per-rule basis.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The keyword &quot;global&quot;
may precede this statement with the same effect as the
command line option, i.e. the build check method applies in
every makefile which does not specify <br>
its own. This should best be given in a RootMakeppfile to be
certain it is seen early enough.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specify &quot;build_check
default&quot; instead of a name if you want to return to the
default. With the keyword &quot;global&quot; this means the
&quot;exact_match&quot; method, else this reverts the <br>
current makefile to not having its own specific method.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">export VAR ... <br>
export assignment <br>
export PATH := $(PWD):$(PATH)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Marks the given variables for
export to subprocesses. See setting variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">global VAR ... <br>
global assignment <br>
global MYPROJECT.INFO = info to be seen in all makefiles</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Marks the given variables as
global to all makefiles. See setting variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">include makefile <br>
This inserts the contents of another makefile into the
current makefile. It can be useful if you have boilerplate
files with a number of rules or variables, and each <br>
directory only needs to make a few modifications. The
&quot;include&quot; statement also used to be commonly used
in traditional makes in conjunction with automatic include
file <br>
scanners, but this is no longer necessary with makepp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;include&quot; first
considers the current directory, then the parent of the
current directory, then its parent, etc. It stops
considering directories when it reaches the root of <br>
the file system or when the file system device ID changes.
(This means that it will not find files located in other NFS
mounts. This is to prevent problems with network <br>
file systems or automounters and dead servers.) If it does
not find a file of the given name by the time its search is
stopped, then it looks in the makepp data directory <br>
(/usr/local/share/makepp if you installed makepp in
/usr/local) for one of the include files that comes with
makepp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to include a
template file in every makefile in a whole directory
hierarchy, you can place your makefile template at the top
directory. The makefiles do not have <br>
to know exactly where they are in the hierarchy; each
makefile can contain a line like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">include
standard_definitions.mk</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">instead of something more
complicated, like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">include
../../../standard_definitions.mk # Is this the right number
of ..?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can specify as many files as
you want, and variables are allowed:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">include file1 file2 file3
$(other_include_files)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you&rsquo;re working on a
build that needs to work with both GNU make and makepp,
sometimes it&rsquo;s convenient to have exactly identical
makefiles but a different include file. <br>
For example, all of your makefiles may contain a line like
this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">include
$(TOPDIR)/standard_rules.mk</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and you want standard_rules.mk
to be different for GNU make and makepp. To facilitate this,
the &quot;include&quot; statement first looks for a file
with the suffix of .makepp before <br>
looking for the file you asked for. In this case, it would
first look for a file called standard_rules.mk.makepp, and
if that exists, it would load it instead of <br>
standard_rules.mk. This way, when you run the makefile with
GNU make, it loads standard_rules.mk, but with makepp, it
loads standard_rules.mk.makepp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Because many legacy files put
the rule to generate an include file after the include
statement, makepp will defer decisions about inexistant or
stale includes till the end of <br>
makefile loading. That is, unless it is invoked with
&quot;--rm-stale&quot;. For as many times as the situation
has improved by then (because a rule appeared) makepp will
reload the <br>
makefile, which may again make more such rules appear. This
is obviously an inefficient way to load makefiles, so try to
avoid that. Worse, if your makefile loading has <br>
side-effects (like appending to a global variable or a line
like &quot;do_it_now := $(shell cat a &gt;&gt;b)&quot; or
its makepp equivalent &quot;&amp;cat a -o&gt;&gt;b&quot;)
they will happen as many times as <br>
the makefile needs to be loaded, so, again, try to avoid
that!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">_include makefile <br>
-include makefile <br>
A minor variant on &quot;include&quot;, the
&quot;_include&quot; statement includes the file if it
exists but doesn&rsquo;t generate a fatal error if it does
not. The &quot;_include&quot; statement used to be <br>
important for include file scanning with GNU make, but is
less useful for makepp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">load_makefile
/some/directory/somewhere/Makefile <br>
load_makefile subdir <br>
load_makefile VAR1=value1 VAR2=value2 subdir <br>
This statement causes makepp to cd to the directory
containing the makefile and load its rules into
makepp&rsquo;s internal database. If you specify just a
directory instead of a <br>
makefile, &quot;load_makefile&quot; looks for
&quot;Makeppfile&quot;, &quot;makefile&quot;, or
&quot;Makefile&quot; in that directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any variables you specify with
the syntax &quot;VAR=value&quot; (or &quot;VAR=&quot;value1
value2&quot;&quot;) are passed to the loaded makefiles. They
override any settings in those makefiles, just as <br>
if you had typed them on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using &quot;load_makefile&quot;
is different from the command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">include dir/makefile</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">in two ways. First,
&quot;load_makefile&quot; does not transfer any variables
from the top-level makefile into the subordinate makefile;
each makefile exists in its own namespace. <br>
The subordinate makefile cannot influence the variables in
the top-level makefile in any way.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Second, each build command is
tagged with the directory of the makefile that it came from.
When makepp executes a rule from a different makefile, it
first cd&rsquo;s to the <br>
directory containing that makefile before executing the
command. Makefiles which are seen with the
&quot;include&quot; statement are actually treated as part
of the makefile that <br>
included them, and therefore their rules are not tagged with
a different directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You usually do not have to load
a makefile explicitly, unless it has an unusual name, or it
has targets which are not contained in the same directory as
the makefile itself, <br>
or you have disabled implicit makefile loading. By default,
if makepp is trying to build a file and doesn&rsquo;t have a
rule to build it, or if it is evaluating a wildcarded <br>
filename in a directory, it will automatically attempt to
load a makefile from that directory. See &quot;Tips for
multiple directories&quot; in makepp_cookbook for info on
building <br>
with multiple directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You cannot use
&quot;load_makefile&quot; to load several makefiles that
apply to the same directory. Use &quot;include&quot; for
several pieces of the makefile that apply to the same
directory, <br>
and &quot;load_makefile&quot; for makefiles that apply to
different directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">no_implicit_load <br>
This statement turns off implicit loading of makefiles from
a set of directories. This can be useful if you want to load
makefiles automatically from most directories, but <br>
there are some directories which for various reasons you do
not want makepp to attempt to update. (E.g., maybe the
directory has a makefile for some other version of make <br>
which makepp does not understand.) For example,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">no_implicit_load dir1 dir2/*</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The above statement will turn
off implicit loading for makefiles in &quot;dir1&quot; and
all of its subdirectories. It will also turn of implicit
makefile loading for all <br>
subdirectories of &quot;dir2&quot; (and all of their
subdirectories), but not for &quot;dir2&quot; itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may use wildcards in the
statement. Non-directory files that match the wildcard are
ignored. You can also use functions to further specify the
directories that you are <br>
interested in, e.g.,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">no_implicit_load $(filter-out
dir1 dir2, *)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will turn off implicit loading
for all subdirectories except dir1 and dir2 and their
subdirectories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">prebuild target <br>
make target <br>
The arguments (which undergo Make-style variable expansion)
are built immediately. This is useful when the list of
targets that the Makefile can build depends on a generated
<br>
file in another directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Currently, it will quietly fail
to build targets if there is a dependency loop among the
prebuilt targets and the Makefiles that must be loaded to
build them, but that ought <br>
to be treated as an error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">register_command_parser
command_word parser <br>
register_parser command_word parser <br>
When lexically analyzing rule actions, use parser for
command_word, which may be the full path or just the
basename. The basename is usually enough because the lexer
tries <br>
both.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The parser may either be a
classname with or without the leading
&quot;Mpp::CommandParser::&quot;. Such a class must have a
member function called &quot;factory&quot; that returns an
object of <br>
that class. If the classname contains colons, it must be
quoted, so as not make this line look like a rule.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Or, because that class is
usually not yet loaded, instead the factory function may
reside in the Makefile namespace. These functions have a
prefix of &quot;p_&quot; which must not be <br>
given. This is the case of the builtin parsers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The effect is comparable to the
&quot;:parser&quot; rule option. But for multi-command rules
this is the better way.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">register_input_suffix
command_word suffix ... <br>
Add &quot;suffix&quot; ... to the list of input file
suffixes recognized when an action beginning with
&quot;command_word&quot; is parsed. The parser would
normally pick this up via <br>
Mpp::CommandParser::input_filename_regexp, but it might
instead ignore this entirely.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Parsers don&rsquo;t normally
pick up all the arguments that aren&rsquo;t recognized as
options, because they might be arguments of unrecognized
options. (For example, i386v is not an <br>
input file of the command &quot;gcc -b i386v foo.c&quot;.)
Instead, they pick up only positional arguments that look
like input filenames.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is not unusual to use
standard tools with site-specific nonstandard suffixes in
order to signify that those files require special handling,
such as different command <br>
options and/or postprocessing steps. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">register_input_suffix cpp .vpp
<br>
%.v: %.vpp <br>
cpp $&lt; &gt; $@</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">repository directory <br>
repository destdir=srcdir <br>
Specifies one or more repository directories. The first
repository specified has precedence over the others if the
same file exists in multiple repositories and there is no
<br>
build command for it. See makepp_repositories for more
details about repositories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you specify just a directory
after &quot;repository&quot;, its contents are linked into
the current directory. You can link its contents into any
arbitrary place in the file system <br>
by specifying the location before an equals sign, e.g,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">repository
subdir1/subdir2=/users/joe/joes_nifty_library</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You should put the repository
statement near the top of your makefile, before any rules
that may need to use it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">runtime program,library <br>
Store &quot;library&quot; as a runtime dependency of
&quot;program&quot;. Both &quot;program&quot; and
&quot;library&quot; may contain multiple words, in which
case each word in &quot;library&quot; is stored as a runtime
<br>
dependency of each word in &quot;program&quot;. When
&quot;program&quot; is added automatically as the executable
dependency of a command by the
&quot;Mpp::CommandParser&quot; base class, its runtime <br>
dependencies (if any) are added as well. In order for this
to happen, &quot;program&quot; must be specified in the rule
with a directory component, and without any shell meta <br>
characters. The purpose of this statement is to capture
dependencies on libraries and other executables that are
often loaded by the program, without having to specify them
<br>
explicitly as dependencies of each rule that invokes
&quot;program&quot;, or to scan &quot;program&quot; to
determine those dependencies (which could be prohibitively
difficult.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Runtime dependencies are
traversed recursively, so if &quot;a&quot; has a runtime
dependency on &quot;b&quot; and &quot;b&quot; has a runtime
dependency on &quot;c&quot;, then any rule that uses
&quot;./a&quot; will have <br>
implicit dependencies on both &quot;b&quot; and
&quot;c&quot; (unless it uses a special
&quot;Mpp::CommandParser&quot; class that overrides this
behavior).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that missing dependencies
won&rsquo;t necessarily be added after you add this
statement to a makefile, unless the rule is re-scanned. Use
the &quot;--force-rescan&quot; command line <br>
option to ensure that this happens.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">signature name <br>
[global] [override] signature name <br>
signature md5 <br>
signature C <br>
signature c_compilation_md5 <br>
signature xml <br>
signature xml-space <br>
signature default</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sets the signature method for
all rules following the &quot;signature&quot; statement, for
which no command parser chooses a method. You can override
this for individual rules with <br>
the &quot;:signature&quot; rule modifier.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you add the keyword
&quot;override&quot;, then this method will override even
the the choice made by command parsers, but not those
specified with the &quot;:signature&quot; rule modifier.
<br>
If you add the keyword &quot;global&quot;, the effect
applies to all rules yet to be read, unless their makefile
also has its own &quot;signature&quot; statement. This is
equivalent to the <br>
&quot;--signature&quot; command line option if given before
any rule is read, e.g. in a RootMakeppfile to be certain it
is seen early enough. Likewise the keywords &quot;global
override&quot; <br>
for this statement are equivalent to the
&quot;--override-signature&quot; command line option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specify &quot;signature
default&quot; instead of a name if you want to return to the
default. With the keyword &quot;global&quot; this means the
simple modification time and file size method. <br>
Else this reverts the current makefile to not having its own
specific method, using a global method if one was set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For more information about
signature methods, see makepp_signatures.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vpath pattern directory ... <br>
Fetch all files matching pattern from each given directory.
Pattern may contain at most one &quot;%&quot; wildcard. This
uses the transparent repository mechanism (unlike gmake
which <br>
rewrites filenames), but it does not recurse into
subdirectories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Commands <br>
All builtin and self defined commands (see builtin commands
and extending makepp), as well as external cleanly
programmed Perl scripts can be used like statements. In this
case <br>
they differ from rule actions in that they run in the same
process as makepp and any input or output files are not
noted as dependencies or as having been built by makepp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As with all statements, they are
considered as such, if they are indented less than the
actions of the previous rule, if any.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This can be used for messages to
be output while reading the makefile:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&amp;echo The value of $$(VAR)
is $(VAR)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Or instead of making many rules
each depend on a directory creation rule, you can simply
create it on the fly. Note that commands which create files
are processed again every <br>
time the makefile is read., That&rsquo;s why we protect this
one with a test -- though in this special case that would
not be necessary, as this command would do no harm when
repeated:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ifperl !-d &rsquo;include&rsquo;
<br>
&amp;mkdir -p include # Create only if not present <br>
endif</p>
