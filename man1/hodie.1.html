<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
hodie - Print current date and time... in Latin</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
hodie [ OPTION ]...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
hodie prints out the current date using classic Latin, and
in addition also prints it out and time using Roman
numerals.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-h, --help <br>
Print short help message with syntax</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
Print months and days (pridie, Kalends, Nones, Ides) full
and not the respective abbreviations (standard mode of
operation)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Two occurrences of -v as well as
the use of -vv or --extremely-verbose will include the
numerals where applicable fully declined, as in &rsquo;ante
diem quintum Kalends Septem&acirc; <br>
bres&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --numerals <br>
Don&rsquo;t print anything in Latin - only the date and time
as Roman numerals.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x, --force-numerals <br>
Print both the verbose latin and the date and time as Roman
numerals.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --classic, --auc <br>
Print the year in the classic manner ab urbe condita instead
of the more modern anno domini .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a, --ante-diem <br>
Print the date expressing the number of days to the next
main day with the ante diem expression instead of ablative
case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --date <br>
Print out any date. This has a rather special syntax, with a
keyword following the -d flag choosing input format. See
section on DATE INPUT below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, --republican OFFSET <br>
Print out the date dated ab urbe tua condita with the offset
counted in years as compared to the modern european kalendar
(originating with the hypothetical birth of <br>
christ). hodie -r -753 would be equivalent with hodie -c</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Print out the version number of this release and exit. No
matter whether other options appear on the command line or
not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DATE INPUT <br>
Following the -d or the --date option flags, the first item
must be one of the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">verbose <br>
In this case, the year, month and day are given by following
the verbose keyword by the flags -y, --year, -m, --month,
-d, --day for year, month and date respectively</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ymd After this flag, the date
comes in the format YYYY-MM-DD , where the numbers may be
separated by any non-numeric character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dmy With this flag, the date is
given as DD-MM-YYYY</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mdy With this flag, the date is
given as MM-DD-YYYY Restrictions on the characters that may
replace the hyphen apply as above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY <br>
The story began on the 10. of August, 2000 (a.d. VI Id.
Iul., MM). Having finished most of my assignment for my
two-month summer job at Ericsson Eurolab Deutschland,
Nuremberg, I <br>
was idling around on the Internet, and stumbled over the
dotcomma-challenges &lt;http://www.dotcomma.org&gt; , where
especially the Roman numeral challenge started my mind.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Almost an hour hacking, and
there it was, another hour, and the language support was
there. Before the night was over, I had written this man
page and had the layout of a decent <br>
Makefile drawn out mentally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At the end of the next day, I
was so far that I actually had the workings of RPM worked
out, constructed a .rpm-package and a .src.rpm-package,
which was promptly released on my <br>
home-page, announced on freshmeat and uploaded to metalab
(apps/misc :-).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Response was quick and
plentiful. By now, I have compilation reports from Linux,
FreeBSD and SCO Unixware 7; there are a few compability
issues to put aside, but it works sur&acirc; <br>
prisingly well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RETURN VALUES <br>
hodie returns zero. Always. If it doesn&rsquo;t, then
something is really bad with the code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For some really unreadable code,
this means that hodie could be used as a strange replacement
for true</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
It doesn&rsquo;t sanity check the input... telling hodie to
display the roman form of the 99th of march gives a slightly
jumbled output, which most definitely does not make
sense.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Reports are more than welcome
(e-mail below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHOR <br>
Now, who would come up with such a thing? Well, I&rsquo;m
Mikael Johansson, a rather all-round geek from Stockholm.
I&rsquo;m gravely interested in languages, in computers and
in mathemat&acirc; <br>
ics; a combination more dangerous than you might think.</p>
