PDL::BadValues - Discussion of bad value support in PDL
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="What_are_bad_values_and_why_should_I_bother_with_them?"><a class="selflink" href="#What_are_bad_values_and_why_should_I_bother_with_them?">What
  are bad values and why should I bother with them?</a></h2>
Sometimes it's useful to be able to specify a certain value is 'bad' or
  'missing'; for example CCDs used in astronomy produce 2D images which are not
  perfect since certain areas contain invalid data due to imperfections in the
  detector. Whilst PDL's powerful index routines and all the complicated
  business with dataflow, slices, etc etc mean that these regions can be ignored
  in processing, it's awkward to do. It would be much easier to be able to say
  &quot;$c = $a + $b&quot; and leave all the hassle to the computer.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you're not interested in this, then you may (rightly) be concerned with how
  this affects the speed of PDL, since the overhead of checking for a bad value
  at each operation can be large. Because of this, the code has been written to
  be as fast as possible - particularly when operating on piddles which do not
  contain bad values. In fact, you should notice essentially no speed difference
  when working with piddles which do not contain bad values.
<div class="Pp"></div>
However, if you do not want bad values, then PDL's &quot;WITH_BADVAL&quot;
  configuration option comes to the rescue; if set to 0 or undef, the bad-value
  support is ignored. About the only time I think you'll need to use this - I
  admit, I'm biased ;) - is if you have limited disk or memory space, since the
  size of the code is increased (see below).
<div class="Pp"></div>
You may also ask 'well, my computer supports IEEE NaN, so I already have this'.
  Well, yes and no - many routines, such as &quot;y=sin(x)&quot;, will propagate
  NaN's without the user having to code differently, but routines such as
  &quot;qsort&quot;, or finding the median of an array, need to be re-coded to
  handle bad values. For floating-point datatypes, &quot;NaN&quot; and
  &quot;Inf&quot; are used to flag bad values <i>IF</i> the option
  &quot;BADVAL_USENAN&quot; is set to 1 in your config file. Otherwise special
  values are used (Default bad values). I do not have any benchmarks to see
  which option is faster.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There is an experimental feature &quot;BADVAL_PER_PDL&quot; which, if set,
  allows you to have different bad values for separate piddles of the same type.
  This currently does not work with the &quot;BADVAL_USENAN&quot; option; if
  both are set then PDL will ignore the &quot;BADVAL_USENAN&quot; value.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Code_increase_due_to_bad_values"><a class="selflink" href="#Code_increase_due_to_bad_values">Code
  increase due to bad values</a></h2>
The following comparison is out of date!
<div class="Pp"></div>
On an i386 machine running Linux and Perl 5.005_03, I measured the following
  sizes (the Slatec code was compiled in, but none of the other options: e.g.,
  FFTW, GSL, and TriD were):
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">WITH_BADVAL = 0</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Size of blib directory after a successful make = <b>4963
      kb</b>: blib/arch = 2485 kb and blib/lib = 1587 kb.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">WITH_BADVAL = 1</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Size of blib directory after a successful make = <b>5723
      kb</b>: blib/arch = 3178 kb and blib/lib = 1613 kb.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
So, the overall increase is <i>only</i> 15% - not much to pay for all the
  wonders that bad values provides ;)
<div class="Pp"></div>
The source code used for this test had the vast majority of the core routines
  (eg those in Basic/) converted to use bad values, whilst very few of the
  'external' routines (i.e. everything else in the PDL distribution) had been
  changed.

&quot;demo bad&quot; and &quot;demo bad2&quot; within perldl or pdl2 gives a
  demonstration of some of the things possible with bad values. These are also
  available on PDL's web-site, at <i>http://pdl.perl.org/demos/</i>. See
  PDL::Bad for useful routines for working with bad values and <i>t/bad.t</i> to
  see them in action.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The intention is to:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">not significantly affect PDL for users who don't need bad
      value support</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">be as fast as possible when bad value support is
    installed</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you never want bad value support, then you set &quot;WITH_BADVAL&quot; to 0
  in <i>perldl.conf</i>; PDL then has no bad value support compiled in, so will
  be as fast as it used to be.
<div class="Pp"></div>
However, in most cases, the bad value support has a negligible affect on speed,
  so you should set &quot;WITH_CONFIG&quot; to 1! One exception is if you are
  low on memory, since the amount of code produced is larger (but only by about
  15% - see &quot;Code increase due to bad values&quot;).
<div class="Pp"></div>
To find out if PDL has been compiled with bad value support, look at the values
  of either $PDL::Config{WITH_BADVAL} or $PDL::Bad::Status - if true then it has
  been.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To find out if a routine supports bad values, use the &quot;badinfo&quot;
  command in perldl or pdl2 or the &quot;-b&quot; option to pdldoc. This
  facility is currently a 'proof of concept' (or, more realistically, a quick
  hack) so expect it to be rough around the edges.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Each piddle contains a flag - accessible via &quot;$pdl-&gt;badflag&quot; - to
  say whether there's any bad data present:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If <b>false/0</b>, which means there's no bad data here,
      the code supplied by the &quot;Code&quot; option to &quot;pp_def()&quot;
      is executed. This means that the speed should be very close to that
      obtained with &quot;WITH_BADVAL=0&quot;, since the only overhead is
      several accesses to a bit in the piddles state variable.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If <b>true/1</b>, then this says there <i>MAY</i> be bad
      data in the piddle, so use the code in the &quot;BadCode&quot; option
      (assuming that the &quot;pp_def()&quot; for this routine has been updated
      to have a BadCode key). You get all the advantages of threading, as with
      the &quot;Code&quot; option, but it will run slower since you are going to
      have to handle the presence of bad values.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you create a piddle, it will have its bad-value flag set to 0. To change
  this, use &quot;$pdl-&gt;badflag($new_bad_status)&quot;, where $new_bad_status
  can be 0 or 1. When a routine creates a piddle, its bad-value flag will depend
  on the input piddles: unless over-ridden (see the
  &quot;CopyBadStatusCode&quot; option to &quot;pp_def&quot;), the bad-value
  flag will be set true if any of the input piddles contain bad values. To check
  that a piddle really contains bad data, use the &quot;check_badflag&quot;
  method.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>NOTE</i>: propagation of the badflag
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you change the badflag of a piddle, this change is propagated to all the
  <i>children</i> of a piddle, so
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   pdl&gt; $a = zeroes(20,30);
   pdl&gt; $b = $a-&gt;slice('0:10,0:10');
   pdl&gt; $c = $b-&gt;slice(',(2)');
   pdl&gt; print &quot;&gt;&gt;c: &quot;, $c-&gt;badflag, &quot;\n&quot;;
   &gt;&gt;c: 0
   pdl&gt; $a-&gt;badflag(1);
   pdl&gt; print &quot;&gt;&gt;c: &quot;, $c-&gt;badflag, &quot;\n&quot;;
   &gt;&gt;c: 1
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>No</i> change is made to the parents of a piddle, so
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   pdl&gt; print &quot;&gt;&gt;a: &quot;, $a-&gt;badflag, &quot;\n&quot;;
   &gt;&gt;a: 1
   pdl&gt; $c-&gt;badflag(0);
   pdl&gt; print &quot;&gt;&gt;a: &quot;, $a-&gt;badflag, &quot;\n&quot;;
   &gt;&gt;a: 1
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Thoughts:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">the badflag can ONLY be cleared IF a piddle has NO parents,
      and that this change will propagate to all the children of that piddle. I
      am not so keen on this anymore (too awkward to code, for one).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">&quot;$a-&gt;badflag(1)&quot; should propagate the badflag
      to BOTH parents and children.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This shouldn't be hard to implement (although an initial attempt failed!). Does
  it make sense though? There's also the issue of what happens if you change the
  badvalue of a piddle - should these propagate to children/parents (yes) or
  whether you should only be able to change the badvalue at the 'top' level -
  i.e. those piddles which do not have parents.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The &quot;orig_badvalue()&quot; method returns the compile-time value for a
  given datatype. It works on piddles, PDL::Type objects, and numbers - eg
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  $pdl-&gt;orig_badvalue(), byte-&gt;orig_badvalue(), and orig_badvalue(4).
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
It also has a horrible name...
<div class="Pp"></div>
To get the current bad value, use the &quot;badvalue()&quot; method - it has the
  same syntax as &quot;orig_badvalue()&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To change the current bad value, supply the new number to badvalue - eg
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  $pdl-&gt;badvalue(2.3), byte-&gt;badvalue(2), badvalue(5,-3e34).
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Note</i>: the value is silently converted to the correct C type, and returned
  - i.e. &quot;byte-&gt;badvalue(-26)&quot; returns 230 on my Linux machine. It
  is also a &quot;nop&quot; for floating-point types when
  &quot;BADVAL_USENAN&quot; is true.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that changes to the bad value are <i>NOT</i> propagated to
  previously-created piddles - they will still have the bad value set, but
  suddenly the elements that were bad will become 'good', but containing the old
  bad value. See discussion below. It's not a problem for floating-point types
  which use NaN, since you can not change their badvalue.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Bad_values_and_boolean_operators"><a class="selflink" href="#Bad_values_and_boolean_operators">Bad
  values and boolean operators</a></h2>
For those boolean operators in PDL::Ops, evaluation on a bad value returns the
  bad value. Whilst this means that
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 $mask = $img &gt; $thresh;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
correctly propagates bad values, it <i>will</i> cause problems for checks such
  as
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 do_something() if any( $img &gt; $thresh );
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
which need to be re-written as something like
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 do_something() if any( setbadtoval( ($img &gt; $thresh), 0 ) );
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
When using one of the 'projection' functions in PDL::Ufunc - such as orover -
  bad values are skipped over (see the documentation of these functions for the
  current (poor) handling of the case when all elements are bad).
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="A_bad_value_for_each_piddle,_and_related_issues"><a class="selflink" href="#A_bad_value_for_each_piddle,_and_related_issues">A
  bad value for each piddle, and related issues</a></h2>
An <b>experimental</b> option &quot;BADVAL_PER_PDL&quot; has been added to
  <i>perldl.conf</i> to allow per-piddle bad values. The documentation has not
  been updated to account for this change.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The following is relevant only for integer types, and for floating-point types
  if &quot;BADVAL_USENAN&quot; was not set when PDL was built.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Currently, there is one bad value for each datatype. The code is written so that
  we could have a separate bad value for each piddle (stored in the pdl
  structure) - this would then remove the current problem of:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 pdl&gt; $a = byte( 1, 2, byte-&gt;badvalue, 4, 5 );
 pdl&gt; p $a;
 [1 2 255 4 5]
 pdl&gt; $a-&gt;badflag(1)
 pdl&gt; p $a;
 [1 2 BAD 4 5]
 pdl&gt; byte-&gt;badvalue(0);
 pdl&gt; p $a;
 [1 2 255 4 5]
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
ie the bad value in $a has lost its <i>bad</i> status using the current
  implementation. It would almost certainly cause problems elsewhere though!
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="IMPLEMENTATION_DETAILS"><a class="selflink" href="#IMPLEMENTATION_DETAILS">IMPLEMENTATION
  DETAILS</a></h1>
PDL code just needs to access the %PDL::Config array (e.g.
  <i>Basic/Bad/bad.pd</i>) to find out whether bad-value support is required.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A new flag has been added to the state of a piddle - &quot;PDL_BADVAL&quot;. If
  unset, then the piddle does not contain bad values, and so all the support
  code can be ignored. If set, it does not guarantee that bad values are
  present, just that they should be checked for. Thanks to Christian,
  &quot;badflag()&quot; - which sets/clears this flag (see
  <i>Basic/Bad/bad.pd</i>) - will update <i>ALL</i> the
  children/grandchildren/etc of a piddle if its state changes (see
  &quot;badflag&quot; in <i>Basic/Bad/bad.pd</i> and
  &quot;propagate_badflag&quot; in <i>Basic/Core/Core.xs.PL</i>). It's not clear
  what to do with parents: I can see the reason for propagating a 'set badflag'
  request to parents, but I think a child should NOT be able to clear the
  badflag of a parent. There's also the issue of what happens when you change
  the bad value for a piddle.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The &quot;pdl_trans&quot; structure has been extended to include an integer
  value, &quot;bvalflag&quot;, which acts as a switch to tell the code whether
  to handle bad values or not. This value is set if any of the input piddles
  have their &quot;PDL_BADVAL&quot; flag set (although this code can be replaced
  by setting &quot;FindBadStateCode&quot; in pp_def). The logic of the check is
  going to get a tad more complicated if I allow routines to fall back to using
  the &quot;Code&quot; section for floating-point types (i.e. those routines
  with &quot;NoBadifNaN =&gt; 1&quot; when &quot;BADVAL_USENAN&quot; is true).
<div class="Pp"></div>
The bad values for the integer types are now stored in a structure within the
  Core PDL structure - &quot;PDL.bvals&quot; (eg
  <i>Basic/Core/pdlcore.h.PL</i>); see also &quot;typedef badvals&quot; in
  <i>Basic/Core/pdl.h.PL</i> and the BOOT code of <i>Basic/Core/Core.xs.PL</i>
  where the values are initialised to (hopefully) sensible values. See
  <i>PDL/Bad/bad.pd</i> for read/write routines to the values.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The addition of the &quot;BADVAL_PER_PDL&quot; option has resulted in additional
  changes to the internals of piddles. These changes are not documented yet.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Why_not_make_a_PDL_subclass?"><a class="selflink" href="#Why_not_make_a_PDL_subclass?">Why
  not make a PDL subclass?</a></h2>
The support for bad values could have been done as a PDL sub-class. The
  advantage of this approach would be that you only load in the code to handle
  bad values if you actually want to use them. The downside is that the code
  then gets separated: any bug fixes/improvements have to be done to the code in
  two different files. With the present approach the code is in the same
  &quot;pp_def&quot; function (although there is still the problem that both
  &quot;Code&quot; and &quot;BadCode&quot; sections need updating).
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Default_bad_values"><a class="selflink" href="#Default_bad_values">Default
  bad values</a></h2>
The default/original bad values are set to (taken from the Starlink
  distribution):
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  #include &lt;limits.h&gt;
  PDL_Byte    ==  UCHAR_MAX
  PDL_Short   ==   SHRT_MIN
  PDL_Ushort  ==  USHRT_MAX
  PDL_Long    ==    INT_MIN
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If &quot;BADVAL_USENAN == 0&quot;, then we also have
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  PDL_Float   ==   -FLT_MAX
  PDL_Double  ==   -DBL_MAX
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
otherwise all of &quot;NaN&quot;, &quot;+Inf&quot;, and &quot;-Inf&quot; are
  taken to be bad for floating-point types. In this case, the bad value can't be
  changed, unlike the integer types.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="How_do_I_change_a_routine_to_handle_bad_values?"><a class="selflink" href="#How_do_I_change_a_routine_to_handle_bad_values?">How
  do I change a routine to handle bad values?</a></h2>
Examples can be found in most of the <i>*.pd</i> files in <i>Basic/</i> (and
  hopefully many more places soon!). Some of the logic might appear a bit
  unclear - that's probably because it is! Comments appreciated.
<div class="Pp"></div>
All routines should automatically propagate the bad status flag to output
  piddles, unless you declare otherwise.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If a routine explicitly deals with bad values, you must provide this option to
  pp_def:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   HandleBad =&gt; 1
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This ensures that the correct variables are initialised for the $ISBAD etc
  macros. It is also used by the automatic document-creation routines to provide
  default information on the bad value support of a routine without the user
  having to type it themselves (this is in its early stages).
<div class="Pp"></div>
To flag a routine as NOT handling bad values, use
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   HandleBad =&gt; 0
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This <i>should</i> cause the routine to print a warning if it's sent any piddles
  with the bad flag set. Primitive's &quot;intover&quot; has had this set -
  since it would be awkward to convert - but I've not tried it out to see if it
  works.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you want to handle bad values but not set the state of all the output
  piddles, or if it's only one input piddle that's important, then look at the
  PP rules &quot;NewXSFindBadStatus&quot; and &quot;NewXSCopyBadStatus&quot; and
  the corresponding &quot;pp_def&quot; options:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">FindBadStatusCode</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">By default, &quot;FindBadStatusCode&quot; creates code
      which sets &quot;$PRIV(bvalflag)&quot; depending on the state of the bad
      flag of the input piddles: see &quot;findbadstatus&quot; in
      <i>Basic/Gen/PP.pm</i>. User-defined code should also store the value of
      &quot;bvalflag&quot; in the &quot;$BADFLAGCACHE()&quot; variable.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">CopyBadStatusCode</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The default code here is a bit simpler than for
      &quot;FindBadStatusCode&quot;: the bad flag of the output piddles are set
      if &quot;$BADFLAGCACHE()&quot; is true after the code has been evaluated.
      Sometimes &quot;CopyBadStatusCode&quot; is set to an empty string, with
      the responsibility of setting the badflag of the output piddle left to the
      &quot;BadCode&quot; section (e.g. the &quot;xxxover&quot; routines in
      <i>Basic/Primitive/primitive.pd</i>).
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Prior to PDL 2.4.3 we used &quot;$PRIV(bvalflag)&quot; instead of
      &quot;$BADFLAGCACHE()&quot;. This is dangerous since the
      &quot;$PRIV()&quot; structure is not guaranteed to be valid at this point
      in the code.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you have a routine that you want to be able to use as in-place, look at the
  routines in <i>bad.pd</i> (or <i>ops.pd</i>) which use the
  &quot;in-place&quot; option to see how the bad flag is propagated to children
  using the &quot;xxxBadStatusCode&quot; options. I decided not to automate this
  as rules would be a little complex, since not every in-place op will need to
  propagate the badflag (eg unary functions).
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the option
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   HandleBad =&gt; 1
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
is given, then many things happen. For integer types, the readdata code
  automatically creates a variable called &quot;&lt;pdl name&gt;_badval&quot;,
  which contains the bad value for that piddle (see
  &quot;get_xsdatapdecl()&quot; in <i>Basic/Gen/PP/PdlParObjs.pm</i>). However,
  do not hard code this name into your code! Instead use macros (thanks to
  Tuomas for the suggestion):
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  '$ISBAD(a(n=&gt;1))'  expands to '$a(n=&gt;1) == a_badval'
  '$ISGOOD(a())'                '$a()     != a_badval'
  '$SETBAD(bob())'              '$bob()    = bob_badval'
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
well, the &quot;$a(...)&quot; is expanded as well. Also, you can use a
  &quot;$&quot; before the pdl name, if you so wish, but it begins to look like
  line noise - eg &quot;$ISGOOD($a())&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you cache a piddle value in a variable -- eg &quot;index&quot; in
  <i>slices.pd</i> -- the following routines are useful:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   '$ISBADVAR(c_var,pdl)'       'c_var == pdl_badval'
   '$ISGOODVAR(c_var,pdl)'      'c_var != pdl_badval'
   '$SETBADVAR(c_var,pdl)'      'c_var  = pdl_badval'
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The following have been introduced, They may need playing around with to improve
  their use.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  '$PPISBAD(CHILD,[i])          'CHILD_physdatap[i] == CHILD_badval'
  '$PPISGOOD(CHILD,[i])         'CHILD_physdatap[i] != CHILD_badval'
  '$PPSETBAD(CHILD,[i])         'CHILD_physdatap[i]  = CHILD_badval'
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If &quot;BADVAL_USENAN&quot; is set, then it's a bit different for
  &quot;float&quot; and &quot;double&quot;, where we consider &quot;NaN&quot;,
  &quot;+Inf&quot;, and &quot;-Inf&quot; all to be bad. In this case:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  ISBAD   becomes   finite(piddle) == 0
  ISGOOD            finite(piddle) != 0
  SETBAD            piddle          = NaN
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
where the value for NaN is discussed below in Handling NaN values.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This all means that you can change
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   Code =&gt; '$a() = $b() + $c();'
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
to
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   BadCode =&gt; 'if ( $ISBAD(b()) || $ISBAD(c()) ) { 
                 $SETBAD(a()); 
               } else {
                 $a() = $b() + $c();
               }'
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
leaving Code as it is. PP::PDLCode will then create a loop something like
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   if ( __trans-&gt;bvalflag ) {
        threadloop over BadCode
   } else { 
        threadloop over Code
   }
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
(it's probably easier to just look at the <i>.xs</i> file to see what goes on).
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Going_beyond_the_Code_section"><a class="selflink" href="#Going_beyond_the_Code_section">Going
  beyond the Code section</a></h2>
Similar to &quot;BadCode&quot;, there's &quot;BadBackCode&quot;, and
  &quot;BadRedoDimsCode&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Handling &quot;EquivCPOffsCode&quot; is a bit different: under the assumption
  that the only access to data is via the &quot;$EQUIVCPOFFS(i,j)&quot; macro,
  then we can automatically create the 'bad' version of it; see the
  &quot;[EquivCPOffsCode]&quot; and &quot;[Code]&quot; rules in PDL::PP.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Macro_access_to_the_bad_flag_of_a_piddle"><a class="selflink" href="#Macro_access_to_the_bad_flag_of_a_piddle">Macro
  access to the bad flag of a piddle</a></h2>
Macros have been provided to provide access to the bad-flag status of a pdl:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  '$PDLSTATEISBAD(a)'    -&gt; '($PDL(a)-&gt;state &amp; PDL_BADVAL) &gt; 0'
  '$PDLSTATEISGOOD(a)'      '($PDL(a)-&gt;state &amp; PDL_BADVAL) == 0'
  '$PDLSTATESETBAD(a)'      '$PDL(a)-&gt;state |= PDL_BADVAL'
  '$PDLSTATESETGOOD(a)'     '$PDL(a)-&gt;state &amp;= ~PDL_BADVAL'
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
For use in &quot;xxxxBadStatusCode&quot; (+ other stuff that goes into the INIT:
  section) there are:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  '$SETPDLSTATEBAD(a)'       -&gt; 'a-&gt;state |= PDL_BADVAL'
  '$SETPDLSTATEGOOD(a)'      -&gt; 'a-&gt;state &amp;= ~PDL_BADVAL'
  '$ISPDLSTATEBAD(a)'        -&gt; '((a-&gt;state &amp; PDL_BADVAL) &gt; 0)'
  '$ISPDLSTATEGOOD(a)'       -&gt; '((a-&gt;state &amp; PDL_BADVAL) == 0)'
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
In PDL 2.4.3 the &quot;$BADFLAGCACHE()&quot; macro was introduced for use in
  &quot;FindBadStatusCode&quot; and &quot;CopyBadStatusCode&quot;.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Handling_NaN_values"><a class="selflink" href="#Handling_NaN_values">Handling
  NaN values</a></h2>
There are two issues:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">NaN as the bad value</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">which is done. To select, set &quot;BADVAL_USENAN&quot; to
      1 in perldl.conf; a value of 0 falls back to treating the floating-point
      types the same as the integers. I need to do some benchmarks to see which
      is faster, and whether it's dependent on machines (Linux seems to slow
      down much more than my Sparc machine in some very simple tests I
    did).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">Ignoring BadCode sections</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">which is <i>not</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
For <i>simple</i> routines processing floating-point numbers, we should let the
  computer process the bad values (i.e. &quot;NaN&quot; and &quot;Inf&quot;
  values) instead of using the code in the &quot;BadCode&quot; section. Many
  such routines have been labeled using &quot;NoBadifNaN =&gt; 1&quot;; however
  this is currently <i>ignored</i> by PDL::PP.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For these routines, we want to use the &quot;Code&quot; section if
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  the piddle does not have its bad flag set
  the datatype is a float or double
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
otherwise we use the &quot;BadCode&quot; section. This is <i>NOT
  IMPLEMENTED</i>, as it will require reasonable hacking of PP::PDLCode!
<div class="Pp"></div>
There's also the problem of how we handle 'exceptions' - since &quot;$a = pdl(2)
  / pdl(0)&quot; produces a bad value but doesn't update the badflag value of
  the piddle. Can we catch an exception, or do we have to trap for this (e.g.
  search for &quot;exception&quot; in <i>Basic/Ops/ops.pd</i>)?
<div class="Pp"></div>
Checking for &quot;Nan&quot;, and &quot;Inf&quot; is done by using the
  &quot;finite()&quot; system call. If you want to set a value to the
  &quot;NaN&quot; value, the following bit of code can be used (this can be
  found in both <i>Basic/Core/Core.xs.PL</i> and <i>Basic/Bad/bad.pd</i>):
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  /* for big-endian machines */
  static union { unsigned char __c[4]; float __d; } 
        __pdl_nan = { { 0x7f, 0xc0, 0, 0 } };
  /* for little-endian machines */
  static union { unsigned char __c[4]; float __d; } 
        __pdl_nan = { { 0, 0, 0xc0, 0x7f } };
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This approach should probably be replaced by library routines such as
  &quot;nan(&quot;&quot;)&quot; or &quot;atof(&quot;NaN&quot;)&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To find out whether a particular machine is big endian, use the routine
  &quot;PDL::Core::Dev::isbigendian()&quot;.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="WHAT_ABOUT_DOCUMENTATION?"><a class="selflink" href="#WHAT_ABOUT_DOCUMENTATION?">WHAT
  ABOUT DOCUMENTATION?</a></h1>
One of the strengths of PDL is its on-line documentation. The aim is to use this
  system to provide information on how/if a routine supports bad values: in many
  cases &quot;pp_def()&quot; contains all the information anyway, so the
  function-writer doesn't need to do anything at all! For the cases when this is
  not sufficient, there's the &quot;BadDoc&quot; option. For code written at the
  Perl level - i.e. in a .pm file - use the &quot;=for bad&quot; pod directive.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This information will be available via man/pod2man/html documentation. It's also
  accessible from the &quot;perldl&quot; or &quot;pdl2&quot; shells - using the
  &quot;badinfo&quot; command - and the &quot;pdldoc&quot; shell command - using
  the &quot;-b&quot; option.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This support is at a very early stage - i.e. not much thought has gone into it:
  comments are welcome; improvements to the code preferred ;) One awkward
  problem is for <i>*.pm</i> code: you have to write a <i>*.pm.PL</i> file which
  only inserts the &quot;=for bad&quot; directive (+ text) if bad value support
  is compiled in. In fact, this is a pain when handling bad values at the Perl,
  rather than PDL::PP, level: perhaps I should just scrap the
  &quot;WITH_BADVAL&quot; option...
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CURRENT_ISSUES"><a class="selflink" href="#CURRENT_ISSUES">CURRENT
  ISSUES</a></h1>
There are a number of areas that need work, user input, or both! They are
  mentioned elsewhere in this document, but this is just to make sure they don't
  get lost.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Trapping_invalid_mathematical_operations"><a class="selflink" href="#Trapping_invalid_mathematical_operations">Trapping
  invalid mathematical operations</a></h2>
Should we add exceptions to the functions in &quot;PDL::Ops&quot; to set the
  output bad for out-of-range input values?
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 pdl&gt; p log10(pdl(10,100,-1))
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
I would like the above to produce &quot;[1 2 BAD]&quot;, but this would slow
  down operations on <i>all</i> piddles. We could check for
  &quot;NaN&quot;/&quot;Inf&quot; values after the operation, but I doubt that
  would be any faster.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Integration_with_NaN"><a class="selflink" href="#Integration_with_NaN">Integration
  with NaN</a></h2>
When &quot;BADVAL_USENAN&quot; is true, the routines in &quot;PDL::Ops&quot;
  should just fall through to the &quot;Code&quot; section - i.e. don't use
  &quot;BadCode&quot; - for &quot;float&quot; and &quot;double&quot; data types.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Global_versus_per-piddle_bad_values"><a class="selflink" href="#Global_versus_per-piddle_bad_values">Global
  versus per-piddle bad values</a></h2>
I think all that's needed is to change the routines in
  &quot;Basic/Core/pdlconv.c.PL&quot;, although there's bound to be
  complications. It would also mean that the pdl structure would need to have a
  variable to store its bad value, which would mean binary incompatibility with
  previous versions of PDL with bad value support.
<div class="Pp"></div>
As of 17 March 2006, PDL contains the <b>experimental</b>
  &quot;BADVAL_PER_PDL&quot; configuration option which, if selected, adds
  per-piddle bad values.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Dataflow_of_the_badflag"><a class="selflink" href="#Dataflow_of_the_badflag">Dataflow
  of the badflag</a></h2>
Currently changes to the bad flag are propagated to the children of a piddle,
  but perhaps they should also be passed on to the parents as well. With the
  advent of per-piddle bad values we need to consider how to handle changes to
  the value used to represent bad items too.
