<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
hdf - Hierarchical Data Format library</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
HDF is a multi-object file format that facilitates the
transfer of various types of scientific data between
machines and operating systems. See http://www.hdf&acirc;
<br>
group.org/release4/platforms.html for a list of platforms
currently supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HDF allows self-definitions of
data content and easy extensibility for future enhancements
or compatibility with other standard formats. HDF includes
Fortran and C calling inter&acirc; <br>
faces, and utilities for manipulating, viewing, and
analyzing data in HDF files. The HDF library contains
interfaces for storing and retrieving compressed or
uncompressed 8-bit <br>
and 24-bit raster images with palettes, n-Dimensional
scientific datasets and binary tables. An interface is also
included that allows arbitrary grouping of other HDF
objects.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HDF Raster Images <br>
HDF supports the storing of both 8-bit and 24-bit raster
images. Beside storing information about the dimensions and
palette of a raster image, HDF supports raster image
com&acirc; <br>
pression. In previous versions of HDF (DF interfaces,)
Run-length encoding and Imcomp compression were both
supported. The currently supported compression methods
include sim&acirc; <br>
ple RLE, N-bit, Skipping huffman, Gzip, Szip, and JPEG.
Although no longer support Imcomp compression, the library
can read images with Imcomp compression.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HDF Scientific Data Sets <br>
Scientific Data Sets (SDSs) are useful for storing
n-Dimensional gridded data. The actual data in the dataset
can be of any of the &quot;standard&quot; number types: 8,
16 and 32bit <br>
signed and unsigned integers and 32 and 64bit floating point
values. In addition, a certain amount of meta-data can be
stored with an SDS including:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o The coordinate system to use
when interpreting or displaying the data. <br>
o Scales to be used for each dimension. <br>
o Labels for each dimension and the dataset as a whole. <br>
o Units for each dimension and the data. <br>
o The valid max and min values for the data. <br>
o Calibration information for the data. <br>
o Fill or missing value information. <br>
o Ability of having more than one file open at a time. <br>
o A more general framework for meta-data within the SDS
data-model <br>
(allowing &rsquo;name = value&rsquo; style meta-data.) <br>
o Support for an &quot;unlimited dimension&quot; in the SDS
data-model, making <br>
it possible to append planes to an array along one
dimension.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HDF Annotations <br>
Any object in an HDF file can have annotations associated
with it. There are a number of types of annotations:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Labels are assumed to be short
strings giving the &quot;name&quot; of a <br>
data object. <br>
o Descriptions are longer text segments that are useful for
giving <br>
more indepth information about a data object <br>
o File annotations are assumed to apply to all of the
objects in a <br>
single file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HDF Vset Interfaces <br>
The Vset module provides interfaces to two basic HDF
building blocks. Vgroups are generic grouping elements
allowing a user to associate related objects within an HDF
file. As <br>
Vgroups can contain other Vgroups, it is possible to build a
hierarchical file. Vdatas are data structures made up of
fields and records. Data is organized into
&quot;fields&quot; within <br>
each Vdata. Each field is identified by a unique
&quot;fieldname&quot;. The type of each field may be any of
the basic number types that HDF supports. Fields of
different types may <br>
exist within the same Vdata.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By combining Vdatas in Vgroups
it is possible to represent higher level data constructs:
mesh data, multi-variate datasets, sparse matrices,
finite-element data, spreadsheets, <br>
splines, non-Cartesian coordinate data, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HDF and netCDF <br>
Starting with HDF version 3.3, netCDF v.2.3.2 of Unidata is
supported with the SD multifile interface. SD and netCDF
interfaces can read both netCDF files and multi-dimensional
<br>
arrays (SDS) stored in the HDF4 files transparently. For
more information, see Chapter 3, &quot;Scientific Data
Sets&quot;, of the HDF User&rsquo;s Guide.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To disable netCDF interfaces in
the HDF library, configure the library using
--disable-netcdf flag and rebuild it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
All HDF routines require the header &quot;hdf.h&quot; to be
included in the C source file, unless if the SD routines are
used, then the header &quot;mfhdf.h&quot; should be included
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fortran programs should use
&quot;dffunc.inc&quot; for all interfaces,
&quot;mffunc.inc&quot; for the SD interfaces, and
&quot;hdf.inc&quot; for non-SD interfaces.</p>

HDF calls on most Unix platforms.</p>
