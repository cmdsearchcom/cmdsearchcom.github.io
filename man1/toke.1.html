<p>TOKE(1) General Commands Manual TOKE(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
toke - OpenBIOS tokenizer</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
toke [options] forth-file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
toke is an open-source FCode Tokenizer from the OpenBIOS
project.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-h, -? Print a brief help message and then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i, --ignore-errors <br>
Generate a Binary Output even if errors were reported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, --load-list <br>
Collect the names of floaded files into an FLoad-List file.
The names collected are in the same form as they were
presented in the fload statements. <br>
The name of the FLoad-List File is derived from the name of
the binary output file, by replacing its extension with .fl
, or, if the binary output file name had no exten&acirc;
<br>
sion, merely appending the extension .fl. <br>
The binary output file name used for this purpose is either
the one specified on the command line, or the one created by
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o, --output-name
OutputFileName, <br>
Direct the binary output (FCode result of Tokenization) to
the named file instead of to the default-named file. This
option is not valid when multiple input files are <br>
named.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P, --dependencies <br>
Collect the fully-resolved pathnames of floaded and ENCODEd
files into a dependency-list file. The names collected are
in the form that is presented to the host operating <br>
system: shell environment Variables and related expressions
will be fully expanded, and the directory within the
include-list in which the file was found will be attached.
<br>
The name of the dependency-list file will be the same as
that of the FLoad-list file, except that its extension will
be .P instead of .fl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
Print additional messages (including advisories) during
tokenization.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I, --Include directory <br>
This tokenizer supports the notion of an include-list. The
user creates the include-list by specifying a number of -I
directory pairs on the command-line. All file-reads, <br>
whether for an fload command or an encode-file directive,
will involve a search for the named file through the
directories of the include-list, in the order they were
sup&acirc; <br>
plied on the command-line. <br>
If no include-list is created, file-reads are relative to
the current working Directory. If an include-list is
created, file-reads are restricted to the directories within
<br>
it. For the current working directory to be included in the
file-search, it must be specified explicitly. -I. will
accomplish that quite effectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T, --Trace symbol <br>
This tokenizer supports the notion of a trace-list. The User
creates the trace-list by specifying a number of -T symbol
pairs on the command-line. <br>
When a name is defined, whether as an FCode, an alias, a
Macro or anything else, either in normal tokenization mode
or &quot;Tokenizer Escape&quot;&acirc;mode, if it matches a
symbol that <br>
has been added to the trace list, a trace note message will
be issued indicating that a definition of that name has been
created. Subsequent trace note Messages will be <br>
issued when the definition of that name is invoked. <br>
This trace-symbols feature can be helpful during maintenance
of legacy code, for instance, when multiple symbols carry
the same name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --define Symbol[=Value] <br>
Define a command-line symbol and optionally, assign a value
to it. If you wish the value to contain spaces or quotes,
you can accomplish that using the shell escape con&acirc;
<br>
ventions. This sequence may be repeated. Once a Symbol is
defined on the command-line, it stays in effect for the
duration of the entire batch of tokenizations (i.e., if <br>
there are multiple input files named on the command line).
Command-line Symbols can be tested for purposes of
conditional tokenization, or their assigned values can be
<br>
evaluated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, --flag [no]&lt;FlagName&gt;
<br>
The tokenizer recognizes a specific set of special-feature
flag-names; each is associated with a specific non-standard
variant behavior. Pass the flag-name as an argument <br>
to the -f switch to enable the behavior; to disable it,
precede the flag-name with the optional string no. <br>
The settings of the special-feature flags can also be
changed or displayed from within the source input file. <br>
The special-feature flags are all initially set to be
enabled, except where noted. <br>
The flag-names and their associated special-features are as
follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Local-Values <br>
Support IBM-style Local Values (&quot;LV&quot;s). Initially
disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LV-Legacy-Separator <br>
Allow Semicolon for Local Values Separator
(&quot;Legacy&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LV-Legacy-Message <br>
Display a Warning Message when Semicolon is used as the
Local Values Separator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ABORT-Quote <br>
Allow ABORT&quot; macro.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sun-ABORT-Quote <br>
ABORT&quot; with implicit IF ... THEN</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Abort-Quote-Throw <br>
Use -2 THROW, rather than ABORT, in an Abort&quot;
phrase</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">String-remark-escape <br>
Allow &quot;&nbsp;(Quote-Backslash) to interrupt string
parsing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hex-remark-escape <br>
Allow &nbsp;(Backslash) to interrupt hex-sequence parsing
within a string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C-Style-string-escape <br>
Allow the C-style String-Escape pairs and to be treated as
special characters in string parsing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Always-Headers <br>
Override occurrences of the standard directive headerless in
the source with -- effectively -- headers to make all
definitions have a header. Occurrences of the <br>
directive external will continue to behave in the standard
manner. Initially disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Always-External <br>
All definitions will be made as though under the external
directive; occurrences of either Standard directive
headerless or headers in the source will be overrid&acirc;
<br>
den. This special-feature flag will also override the
Always-Headers special-feature flag in the event that both
have been specified. Initially disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warn-if-Duplicate <br>
Display a WARNING message whenever a definition is made
whose name duplicates that of an existing definition.
Disabling this flag will suspend the duplicate-names <br>
test globally, until it is re-enabled. A Directive is
supported that will suspend the test for the duration of
only a single definition, without affecting global <br>
behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Obsolete-FCode-Warning <br>
Display a WARNING message whenever an FCode function is
invoked that the Standard identifies as obsolete.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Trace-Conditionals <br>
Issue advisory messages about the state of conditional
tokenization. (Remember that advisory messages are displayed
only if the verbose option -v is set.) Initially <br>
disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Upper-Case-Token-Names <br>
Lower-Case-Token-Names When outputting the names of headered
functions (token-names) to the binary output file, override
the character-case in which the names <br>
appeared in the source, and convert them to Upper- or Lower-
&acirc;Case, respectively. (These flags do not affect text
string sequences, whose character-case is always <br>
preserved.) Initially disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Big-End-PCI-Rev-Level <br>
Save the Revision Level of the Vendor&rsquo;s ROM field of
the PCI Header in big-endian byte-order, rather than
little-endian as per the general PCI Standard convention.
<br>
(This flag does not affect any other field <br>
of the PCI Header). Initially disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ret-Stk-Interp <br>
Allow return-stack operations during interpretation. While
the standard specifies that usage of the operators &gt;r,
r@, and r&gt; while interpreting is allowed, actual <br>
practice in the industry is inconsistent. Developers who
wish to take a more cautious approach to this question can
disable this flag so that any attempt to use <br>
the operators &gt;r, r@, and r&gt; in the interpreting state
will generate an ERROR Message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also, the pseudo-flag-name help
will cause a list of the flag-names and their associated
special-features to be printed.</p>
