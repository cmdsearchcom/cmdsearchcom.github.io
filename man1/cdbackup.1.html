<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
cdbackup - Streaming backup to CD-R(W)/DVR-R(W)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
cdbackup [-mvwCDRVX] [-d device] [-r scsi-dev] [-s speed]
<br>
[-i image] [-p num] [-l size] [-a label] <br>
[-c command] [-E cdrecord] [-- cdrecord-options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
cdbackup is a utility to make streaming backups to
CD-R(W)/DVD-R(W) disks. It&rsquo;s designed to work with any
backup tool which writes the backup to stdout (like
tar/cpio/afio).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: this program REQUIRES that
a recent version of cdrecord(1) (or cdrecord-ProDVD for DVD
support) is present in the PATH.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">While you can perfectly append
several sessions on CD-R(W) media, I didn&rsquo;t manage to
make this work on DVD-R(W) media. To allow multiple,
separate backups on these media, the <br>
concept of virtual images has been introduced. <br>
A virtual image is a plain file on your harddisk. You can
append several backups to an image and after completing your
backup session, the image is dumped to CDR/DVD media in one
<br>
burning session. You can dump the same image multiple times
too, if you want redundancy on the CDR/DVD media. <br>
Virtual image files are never deleted by cdbackup. After
dumping an image, you have to delete it by your self.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WARNING! When using this program
under Linux, be sure not to use dump on a mounted
filesystem. This has a high potential for creating corrupted
backups. As of kernel version <br>
2.4.19, this has not been fixed and it may not be fixed at
all. You can read Linus statement about this at <br>

&lt;http://search.alphanet.ch/cgi-bin/search.cgi?max_results=10&amp;type=long&amp;msgid=Pine.LNX.4.21.0104270953280.2067-100000@penguin.transmeta.com&amp;domain=ml-linux-kernel&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-d device <br>
The device name which is used for reading things like the
TOC from a (partly written) media. <br>
(default: /dev/burner)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r scsi-device <br>
The scsi device which is passed to cdrecord(1) (via
dev=scsi-device). Must be given as three, comma separated
numbers: scsibus,target,lun. <br>
(default: none or the contents of the environment variable
CDR_DEVICE)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s speed <br>
The writing speed which is passed to cdrecord(1) (via
speed=speed). <br>
(default: 4 or the contents of the environment variable
CDR_SPEED)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p num The number of sectors (of
2048 byte) to use for padding (see cdrecord(1) padsize).
<br>
(default: 15)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X Enables the use of CDROM XA2
mode in cdrecord(1). By default CDROM mode 1 is used. The
default is possibly causing problems during restore on
certain kernel version/CDROM <br>
hardware combinations at the end of the last session on a
media. Sony drives doesn&rsquo;t support CDROM XA 2 mode
(see cdrecord(1) -multi).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R Enables DVD writing mode.
Make sure that your cdrecord(1) version is able to burn DVD
media. <br>
Remember that you cannot write multiple sessions to DVD
media. Either you stick with one backup per media or you
have to use virtual images. <br>
In DVD mode the options -p and -X have no effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E cdrecord <br>
Set an alternate cdrecord executeable. <br>
(default: &quot;cdrecord&quot;)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i image <br>
Enables virtual image mode. The backup stream is written to
the given image file. The file is created if it
doesn&rsquo;t exist. It&rsquo;s mandatory to give an
explicit media size <br>
with -l. Take care that the created virtual image
isn&rsquo;t larger that the media size you want to dump it
to later. You can add up to 96 backups to an virtual image.
<br>
If the backup extends the specified media size and you have
enabled multi-disk mode, additional image files are created
(the filenames are derived from the initial image <br>
name by adding a dot and a decimal number). <br>
(default: none)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w Dump the virtual image
specified with -i to real media. Image dumps are written as
single sessions always. If you have enabled multi-disk mode
and additional images are <br>
found, you&rsquo;re prompted for media change, so that you
can dump all images in turn. <br>
Virtual images (even when dumped to media) are not
compatible with older cdbackup versions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l size <br>
For normal operation the media size is auto-detected from
the cdrecord ATIP information. If this fails or for virtual
image mode use this option to set the media size. <br>
This is used to calculate how much data can be stored on the
media. <br>
By default the given value is taken as megabytes. You can
append a single letter to the number to select: (k)ilobytes,
(m)egabytes, (g)igabytes or (s)ectors (e.g. 170k, <br>
4488m, 350000s). <br>
(default: auto-detect)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C Disables creation of the
datablock CRC checksum. There is no real reason to use this
option, unless you can&rsquo;t efford the extra 0,2% media
space that is used to store the <br>
checksum. <br>
Although the on-disk layout of checksummed backups is
different, they are fully backwards compatible with older
version of cdbackup, but obviously older versions
can&rsquo;t <br>
check the backup integrity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a label <br>
A text label to identify the backup set. The first 32
characters of this string are save with the backup. <br>
(default: &quot;CDBackup Track&quot;)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c command <br>
The command which is executed whenever cdbackup needs to
request a new media in multi-disk mode. This command (or
script) should prompt the user and return after the <br>
recording device is ready again. The command receives one
argument, which is the device name passed with -d. This can
be used to issue commands to the device like ejecting <br>
the media. <br>
(default: use internal diskchange prompt)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m Enables multi-disk mode. When
the current media is filled, a new media is requested (see
option -c) and the backup is continued. Backups can only be
continued to empty <br>
media, this means you cannot insert a partly filled media
for continuation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Enables verbose mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D Enables DEBUG output
(probably not useful for normal use).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Prints out version
information and exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-- cdrecord-options <br>
Pass following options to cdrecord(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
To create a tar archive of /home and output it to a 700 MB
CD-R(W) on /dev/scd0 (scsi device 2,0):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tar cvf - /home | cdbackup -d
/dev/scd0 -r 2,0 -l 700 -a &quot;Test Backup&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To create a tar archive of /usr
and output it to a series (multi-disk mode) of 650 MB
CD-R(W) on /dev/sr1 (scsi device 1,4,0) with writing speed
12 and verbose output:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tar cf - /usr | cdbackup -d
/dev/sr1 -r 1,4,0 -s 12 -m -v</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To create a backup on a virtual
image:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tar cf - /usr | cdbackup -i
/tmp/vimage -l 4488m</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Add another backup to the same
virtual image (with multi-disk mode):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tar cf - /home | cdbackup -i
/tmp/vimage -l 4488m</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Dump the virtual image to one
(or several) DVD media on /dev/cdrom (scsi-ide device
0,0,0), enabling BURNFREE:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cdbackup -i /tmp/vimage -w -R -d
/dev/cdrom -r 0,0,0 -s 4 -m -- driveropts=burnfree</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KNOWN PROBLEMS <br>
Certain combinations of CDROM drivers and kernel versions
are causing a problem when restoring data. The restore
process aborts with an read error close to the end of the
ses&acirc; <br>
sion, while the data on the media is perfectly good.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All CDR sessions written in
track-at-once mode (which is unavoidable for multisessions)
end in at least two unreadable runout sectors (for
additional information refer to the <br>
file README.copy from the cdrecord package). As the kernel
does some readahead on the device, it stumbles over these
unreadable sectors before reaching the actual end of
data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some drivers are reporting to
syslog but doesn&rsquo;t pass the error to the application,
while others make the application fail. From user feedback,
it seems that pure SCSI setups are <br>
mostly working fine, while ide-scsi setups are likely to
fail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The author isn&rsquo;t able to
provide a full solution, but some hints which may help:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. Update to a recent
kernel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Disable kernel readahead with
option -R when restoring.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. Increase the padsize with
option -p. Use values &gt;= 128.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. Use option -X if your writer
supports this (Sony drives doesn&rsquo;t supports this
mode).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please contact the author if you
can contribute additional information about the problem.</p>
