<p>CUT(1POSIX) POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s Manual
CUT(1POSIX)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROLOG <br>
This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s
Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of <br>
Linux behavior), or the interface may not be implemented on
Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
cut &acirc; cut out selected fields of each line of a
file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
cut &acirc;b list [&acirc;n] [file...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cut &acirc;c list [file...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cut &acirc;f list [&acirc;d
delim] [&acirc;s] [file...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The cut utility shall cut out bytes (&acirc;b option),
characters (&acirc;c option), or character-delimited fields
(&acirc;f option) from each line in one or more files,
concatenate them, and <br>
write them to standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The cut utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume
of POSIX.1&acirc;2008, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax
Guidelines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The application shall ensure
that the option-argument list (see options &acirc;b,
&acirc;c, and &acirc;f below) is a &lt;comma&gt;-separated
list or &lt;blank&gt;-separated list of positive numbers and
<br>
ranges. Ranges can be in three forms. The first is two
positive numbers separated by a &lt;hyphen&gt;
(low&acirc;high), which represents all fields from the first
number to the second num&acirc; <br>
ber. The second is a positive number preceded by a
&lt;hyphen&gt; (&acirc;high), which represents all fields
from field number 1 to that number. The third is a positive
number followed by a <br>
&lt;hyphen&gt; (low&acirc;), which represents that number to
the last field, inclusive. The elements in list can be
repeated, can overlap, and can be specified in any order,
but the bytes, <br>
characters, or fields selected shall be written in the order
of the input data. If an element appears in the selection
list more than once, it shall be written exactly once.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options shall be
supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;b list Cut based on a
list of bytes. Each selected byte shall be output unless the
&acirc;n option is also specified. It shall not be an error
to select bytes not present in the <br>
input line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;c list Cut based on a
list of characters. Each selected character shall be output.
It shall not be an error to select characters not present in
the input line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;d delim Set the field
delimiter to the character delim. The default is the
&lt;tab&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;f list Cut based on a
list of fields, assumed to be separated in the file by a
delimiter character (see &acirc;d). Each selected field
shall be output. Output fields shall be sepa&acirc; <br>
rated by a single occurrence of the field delimiter
character. Lines with no field delimiters shall be passed
through intact, unless &acirc;s is specified. It shall not
be an <br>
error to select fields not present in the input line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;n Do not split
characters. When specified with the &acirc;b option, each
element in list of the form low&acirc;high
(&lt;hyphen&gt;-separated numbers) shall be modified as
follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* If the byte selected by low is
not the first byte of a character, low shall be decremented
to select the first byte of the character originally
selected by low. If <br>
the byte selected by high is not the last byte of a
character, high shall be decremented to select the last byte
of the character prior to the character originally <br>
selected by high, or zero if there is no prior character. If
the resulting range element has high equal to zero or low
greater than high, the list element shall be <br>
dropped from list for that input line without causing an
error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each element in list of the form
low&acirc; shall be treated as above with high set to the
number of bytes in the current line, not including the
terminating &lt;newline&gt;. Each <br>
element in list of the form &acirc;high shall be treated as
above with low set to 1. Each element in list of the form
num (a single number) shall be treated as above with low
<br>
set to num and high set to num.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;s Suppress lines with no
delimiter characters, when used with the &acirc;f option.
Unless specified, lines with no delimiters shall be passed
through untouched.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERANDS <br>
The following operand shall be supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file A pathname of an input
file. If no file operands are specified, or if a file
operand is &rsquo;&acirc;&rsquo;, the standard input shall
be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDIN <br>
The standard input shall be used only if no file operands
are specified, or if a file operand is
&rsquo;&acirc;&rsquo;. See the INPUT FILES section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUT FILES <br>
The input files shall be text files, except that line
lengths shall be unlimited.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
The following environment variables shall affect the
execution of cut:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LANG Provide a default value for
the internationalization variables that are unset or null.
(See the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008,
Section 8.2, Internationaliza&acirc; <br>
tion Variables for the precedence of internationalization
variables used to determine the values of locale
categories.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_ALL If set to a non-empty
string value, override the values of all the other
internationalization variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_CTYPE Determine the locale
for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text data as
characters (for example, single-byte as opposed to
multi-byte characters in arguments <br>
and input files).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_MESSAGES <br>
Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
standard error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NLSPATH Determine the location
of message catalogs for the processing of LC_MESSAGES.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDOUT <br>
The cut utility output shall be a concatenation of the
selected bytes, characters, or fields (one of the
following):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;%s0, &lt;concatenation of
bytes&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;%s0, &lt;concatenation of
characters&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;%s0, &lt;concatenation of
fields and field delimiters&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDERR <br>
The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT FILES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTENDED DESCRIPTION <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The following exit values shall be returned:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 All input files were output
successfully.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following sections are
informative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">APPLICATION USAGE <br>
The cut and fold utilities can be used to create text files
out of files with arbitrary line lengths. The cut utility
should be used when the number of lines (or records) needs
<br>
to remain constant. The fold utility should be used when the
contents of long lines need to be kept contiguous.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Earlier versions of the cut
utility worked in an environment where bytes and characters
were considered equivalent (modulo &lt;backspace&gt; and
&lt;tab&gt; processing in some implementa&acirc; <br>
tions). In the extended world of multi-byte characters, the
new &acirc;b option has been added. The &acirc;n option
(used with &acirc;b) allows it to be used to act on bytes
rounded to character <br>
boundaries. The algorithm specified for &acirc;n guarantees
that:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cut &acirc;b 1&acirc;500
&acirc;n file &gt; file1 <br>
cut &acirc;b 501&acirc; &acirc;n file &gt; file2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ends up with all the characters
in file appearing exactly once in file1 or file2. (There is,
however, a &lt;newline&gt; in both file1 and file2 for each
&lt;newline&gt; in file.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Examples of the option qualifier list:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1,4,7 Select the first, fourth,
and seventh bytes, characters, or fields and field
delimiters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1&acirc;3,8 Equivalent to
1,2,3,8.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;5,10 Equivalent to
1,2,3,4,5,10.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3&acirc; Equivalent to third to
last, inclusive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The low&acirc;high forms are not
always equivalent when used with &acirc;b and &acirc;n and
multi-byte characters; see the description of &acirc;n.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cut &acirc;d : &acirc;f 1,6
/etc/passwd</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reads the System V password file
(user database) and produces lines of the form:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;user ID&gt;:&lt;home
directory&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most utilities in this volume of
POSIX.1&acirc;2008 work on text files. The cut utility can
be used to turn files with arbitrary line lengths into a set
of text files containing the <br>
same data. The paste utility can be used to create (or
recreate) files with arbitrary line lengths. For example, if
file contains long lines:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cut &acirc;b 1&acirc;500
&acirc;n file &gt; file1 <br>
cut &acirc;b 501&acirc; &acirc;n file &gt; file2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">creates file1 (a text file) with
lines no longer than 500 bytes (plus the &lt;newline&gt;)
and file2 that contains the remainder of the data from file.
(Note that file2 is not a text <br>
file if there are lines in file that are longer than 500 +
{LINE_MAX} bytes.) The original file can be recreated from
file1 and file2 using the command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">paste &acirc;d &quot; &quot;
file1 file2 &gt; file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RATIONALE <br>
Some historical implementations do not count
&lt;backspace&gt; characters in determining character counts
with the &acirc;c option. This may be useful for using cut
for processing nroff out&acirc; <br>
put. It was deliberately decided not to have the &acirc;c
option treat either &lt;backspace&gt; or &lt;tab&gt;
characters in any special fashion. The fold utility does
treat these characters spe&acirc; <br>
cially.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unlike other utilities, some
historical implementations of cut exit after not finding an
input file, rather than continuing to process the remaining
file operands. This behavior <br>
is prohibited by this volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008, where
only the exit status is affected by this problem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The behavior of cut when
provided with either mutually-exclusive options or options
that do not work logically together has been deliberately
left unspecified in favor of global <br>
wording in Section 1.4, Utility Description Defaults.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The OPTIONS section was changed
in response to IEEE PASC Interpretation 1003.2 #149. The
change represents historical practice on all known systems.
The original standard was <br>
ambiguous on the nature of the output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The list option-arguments are
historically used to select the portions of the line to be
written, but do not affect the order of the data. For
example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">echo abcdefghi | cut
&acirc;c6,2,4&acirc;7,1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">yields &quot;abdefg&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A proposal to enhance cut with
the following option:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;o Preserve the selected
field order. When this option is specified, each byte,
character, or field (or ranges of such) shall be written in
the order specified by the list <br>
option-argument, even if this requires multiple outputs of
the same bytes, characters, or fields.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">was rejected because this type
of enhancement is outside the scope of the IEEE P1003.2b
draft standard.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FUTURE DIRECTIONS <br>
None.</p>
