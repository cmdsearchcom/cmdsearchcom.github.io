<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
saxon8 - manual page for saxon8</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
saxon8 [options] source-document stylesheet [ params...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
saxon8 applies a given stylesheet to a given source XML
document.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
For a schema-aware transformation, specify the option -sa,
or (on the Java platform only) use the alternate entry point
com.saxonica.Transform. For more details see Schema-Aware
<br>
Transformations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The options must come first,
then the two file names, then the params. The stylesheet is
omitted if the -a option is present.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The options are as follows (in
any order):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a Use the xml-stylesheet
processing instruction in the source document to identify
the stylesheet to be used. The stylesheet argument should be
omitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Indicates that the stylesheet
argument identifies a compiled stylesheet rather than an XML
source stylesheet. The stylesheet must have been previously
compiled as <br>
described in Compiling a Stylesheet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-cr classname <br>
Use the specified CollectionURIResolver to process
collection URIs passed to the collection() function. The
CollectionURIResolver is a user-defined class that
implements <br>
the net.sf.saxon.CollectionURIResolver interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ds | -dt <br>
Selects the implementation of the internal tree model. -dt
selects the tiny tree model (the default). -ds selects the
linked tree model. See Choosing a tree model.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-im modename <br>
Selects the initial mode for the transformation. If this is
namespaced, it can be written as {uri}localname</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-it template <br>
Selects the initial named template to be executed. If this
is namespaced, it can be written as {uri}localname. When
this option is used, the source file should be omitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l Switches line numbering on
for the source document. Line numbers are accessible through
the extension function saxon:line-number(), or from a trace
listener.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m classname <br>
Use the specified Emitter to process the output from
xsl:message. The class must implement the
net.sf.saxon.output.Emitter class. This interface is similar
to a SAX Con&acirc; <br>
tentHandler, it takes a stream of events to generate output.
In general the content of a message is an XML fragment. By
default the standard XML emitter is used, config&acirc; <br>
ured to write to the standard error stream, and to include
no XML declaration. Each message is output as a new
document.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-noext Suppress calls on
extension functions, other than system-supplied Saxon and
EXSLT extension functions. This option is useful when
loading an untrusted stylesheet, perhaps <br>
from a remote site using an http:// URL; it ensures that the
stylesheet cannot call Java methods and thereby gain
privileged access to resources on your machine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-novw No version warnings. This
suppresses the warning message that is normally issued (as
required by the W3C specification) when running an XSLT 2.0
processor against a <br>
stylesheet that specifies version=1.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o filename <br>
Send output to named file. In the absence of this option,
the results go to standard output. If the source argument
identifies a directory, this option is mandatory and <br>
must also identify a directory; on completion it will
contain one output file for each file in the source
directory. If the stylesheet writes secondary output files
using <br>
the xsl:result-document instruction; this filename acts as
the base URI for the href attribute of this instruction. In
the absence of this option, secondary output files <br>
are written relative to the current working directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p Use the PTreeURIResolver.
This option is available in Saxon-SA only. It cannot be used
in conjunction with the -r option, and it automatically
switches on the -u and -sa <br>
options. The effect is twofold. Firstly, Saxon-specific file
extensions are recognized in URIs (including the URI of the
source document on the command line). Currently <br>
the only Saxon-specific file extension is .ptree, which
indicates that the source document is supplied in the form
of a Saxon PTree. This is a binary representation of an <br>
XML document, designed for speed of loading. Secondly,
Saxon-specific query parameters are recognized in a URI.
Currently the only query parameter that is recognized is
<br>
val. This may take the values strict, lax, or strip. For
example, source.xml?val=strict loads a document with strict
schema validation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r classname <br>
Use the specified URIResolver to process all URIs. The
URIResolver is a user-defined class, that extends the
net.sf.saxon.URIResolver class, whose function is to take a
<br>
URI supplied as a string, and return a SAX InputSource. It
is invoked to process URIs used in the document() function,
in the xsl:include and xsl:import elements, and (if <br>
-u is also specified) to process the URIs of the source file
and stylesheet file provided on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sa Invoke a schema-aware
transformation. Requires Saxon-SA to be installed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sall Strips all whitespace text
nodes from source documents before any further processing,
regardless of any xsl:strip-space declarations in the
stylesheet, or any xml:space <br>
attributes in the source document.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-signorable <br>
Strips all ignorable whitespace text nodes from source
documents before any further processing, regardless of any
xsl:strip-space declarations in the stylesheet, or any <br>
xml:space attributes in the source document. Whitespace text
nodes are ignorable if they appear in elements defined in
the DTD or schema as having element-only content.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-snone Strips no whitespace
before further processing. (However, whitespace will still
be stripped if this is specified in the stylesheet using
xsl:strip-space).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Display version and timing
information to the standard error output. The output also
traces the files that are read and writing, and extension
modules that are loaded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T Display stylesheet tracing
information to the standard error output. This traces
execution of each instruction in the stylesheet, so the
output can be quite voluminous. <br>
Also switches line numbering on for the source document.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-TJ Switches on tracing of the
binding of calls to external Java methods. This is useful
when analyzing why Saxon fails to find a Java method to
match an extension function <br>
call in the stylesheet, or why it chooses one method over
another when several are available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-TL classname <br>
Run the stylesheet using the specified TraceListener. The
classname names a user-defined class, which must implement
net.sf.saxon.trace.TraceListener</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-TP Run the stylesheet using the
TraceListener TimedTraceListener. This creates an output
file giving timings for each instruction executed. This
output file can subsequently <br>
be analyzed to give an execution time profile for the
stylesheet. See Performance Analysis.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u Indicates that the names of
the source document and the style document are URLs;
otherwise they are taken as filenames, unless they start
with http: or file:, in which <br>
case they are taken as URLs</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Requests DTD-based validation
of the source file and of any files read using the
document() function. Requires an XML parser that supports
validation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-val Requests schema-based
validation of the source file and of any files read using
the document() function. This option is available only with
Saxon-SA, and it automatically <br>
switches on the -sa option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-vlax This option is available
only with Saxon-SA, and it automatically switches on the -sa
option. It requests lax validation of source documents using
an XML Schema. That is, <br>
the document will be validated if a suitable schema is
available, and will not be validated otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-vw Indicates that validation
errors found when validating the result tree should be
treated as warnings only. This option is available only with
the Saxon-SA version of the <br>
command, com.saxonica.Transform.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w0, w1, or w2 <br>
Indicates the policy for handling recoverable errors in the
stylesheet: w0 means recover silently, w1 means recover
after writing a warning message to the system error <br>
output, w2 means signal the error and do not attempt
recovery. (Note, this does not currently apply to all errors
that the XSLT recommendation describes as recoverable). <br>
The default is w1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x classname <br>
Use specified SAX parser for source file and any files
loaded using the document() function. The parser must be the
fully-qualified class name of a Java class that imple&acirc;
<br>
ments the org.xml.sax.Parser or org.xml.sax.XMLReader
interface</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-y classname <br>
Use specified SAX parser for stylesheet file, including any
loaded using xsl:include or xsl:import. The parser must be
the fully-qualified class name of a Java class that <br>
implements the org.xml.sax.Parser or org.xml.sax.XMLReader
interface</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-1.1 Allow XML 1.1 and XML
Namespaces 1.1 constructs. This option must be set if source
documents using XML 1.1 are to be read, or if result
documents are to be serialized as <br>
XML 1.1. This option also enables use of XML 1.1 constructs
within the stylesheet itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-? Display command syntax</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">source-document <br>
Identifies the source file or directory. Mandatory. If this
is a directory, all the files in the directory will be
processed individually. In this case the -o option is <br>
mandatory, and must also identify a directory, to contain
the corresponding output files. A directory must be
specified as a filename, not as a URL. The source-document
<br>
can be specified as - to take the source from standard
input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">stylesheet <br>
Identifies the stylesheet. Mandatory unless the -a option is
used. If the -c option is used, this argument identifies a
compiled stylesheet. The stylesheet argument can be <br>
specified as - to read the stylesheet from standard
input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A param takes the form
name=value, name being the name of the parameter, and value
the value of the parameter. These parameters are accessible
within the stylesheet as <br>
normal variables, using the syntax, provided they are
declared using a top-level xsl:param element. If there is no
such declaration, the supplied parameter value is <br>
silently ignored. If the xsl:param element has an as
attribute indicating the required type, then the string
value supplied on the command line is cast to this type:
this <br>
may result in an error, for example if an integer is
required and the supplied value cannot be converted to an
integer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A param preceded by a leading
exclamation mark (!) is interpreted as an output parameter.
For example, !indent=yes requests indented output. This is
equivalent to specifying the <br>
attribute indent=yes on an xsl:output declaration in the
stylesheet. An output parameter specified on the command
line overrides one specified within the stylesheet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A param preceded by a leading
plus sign (+) is interpreted as a filename or directory. The
content of the file is parsed as XML, and the resulting
document node is passed to the <br>
stylesheet as the value of the parameter. If the parameter
value is a directory, then all the immediately contained
files are parsed as XML, and the resulting sequence of
docu&acirc; <br>
ment nodes is passed as the value of the parameter. For
example, +lookup=lookup.xml sets the value of the stylesheet
parameter lookup to the document node at the root of the
tree <br>
representing the parsed contents of the file lookup.xml.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Under Windows, and some other
operating systems, it is possible to supply a value
containing spaces by enclosing it in double quotes, for
example name=John Smith. This is a fea&acirc; <br>
ture of the operating system shell, not something Saxon
does, so it may not work the same way under every operating
system. (In the jEdit console plugin it has to be written as
<br>
name=John Smith)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the parameter name is in a
non-null namespace, the parameter can be given a value using
the syntax {uri}localname=value. Here uri is the namespace
URI of the parameter&rsquo;s name, <br>
and localname is the local part of the name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This applies also to output
parameters. For example, you can set the indentation level
to 4 by using the parameter
!{http://saxon.sf.net/}indent-spaces=4. See also Additional
<br>
attributes for xsl:output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -a option is used, the
name of the stylesheet is omitted. The source document must
contain a &lt;?xml-stylesheet?&gt; processing instruction
before the first element start tag; <br>
this processing instruction must have a pseudo-attribute
href that identifies the relative or absolute URL of the
stylsheet document, and a pseudo-attribute type whose value
is <br>
text/xml, application/xml, or text/xsl. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;?xml-stylesheet
type=text/xsl href=../style3.xsl ?&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is also possible to refer to
a stylesheet embedded within the source document, provided
it has an id attribute and the id attribute is declared in
the DTD as being of type ID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/etc/java/resolver/CatalogManager.properties <br>
The central catalog manager configuration file used by saxon
for resolving XML entities and URIs if xml-commons-resolver
is available.</p>
