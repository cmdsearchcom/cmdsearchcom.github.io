<p>debsig-verify(1) dpkg suite debsig-verify(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
debsig-verify - Verify signatures for a Debian format
package</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
debsig-verify [option...] deb</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This program is part of a security model that verifies the
source and validity of a Debian format package (commonly
referred to as a deb).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This program implements the
verification specs defined in the document, &quot;Package
Verification with dpkg: Implementation&quot;, which is a
more complete reference for the verification <br>
procedure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The program generally takes one
argument, the deb file to be verified. It will then check
the origin signature of the deb, find its Public Key ID
(long format), and use that as <br>
the name for a policy subdirectory. If this subdirectory
does not exist, then the verification fails immediately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In this subdirectory, the
program finds one or more files named with the .pol file
extension, which signifies an XML format policy definition.
This file contains three main <br>
parts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Origin Information about the
origin of this policy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Selection <br>
Rules used to decide if this policy is pertinent to this
deb&rsquo;s verification.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Verification <br>
Rules that are used to actually verify the deb.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The policy files will reference
keyrings by a filename. These keyrings will be looked for in
a subdirectory of the keyring directory. The subdirectory
has the same name as the <br>
policy subdirectory (previously determined by the
Origin&rsquo;s Public Key ID).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The program will, after first
parsing the entire file, check the Origin ID against the
Public Key ID of the origin signature in the deb. If these
match (which they should, else <br>
something is really wrong), then it will proceed to the
Selection rules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Selection rules decide
whether this policy is suitable for verifying this deb. If
these rules fail, then the program will proceed to the next
policy. If it passes, then the <br>
program commits to using this policy for verification, and
no other policies will be referenced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The last verification step
relies on the Verification rules. These are similar in
format to the Selection rules, but are usually more
constrained. If these rules fail, the pro&acirc; <br>
gram exits with a non-zero status. If they pass, then it
exits with a zero status.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-q, --quiet <br>
Causes the program to send no output, other than fatal
errors. This is useful when being called from another
program, where you rely on the exit value only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
Causes the program to send more output on execution, so as
to follow the steps it is taking while trying to verify the
deb.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --debug <br>
Outputs even more info than the -v option. This is mainly
for debugging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help Outputs the usage
information for the program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Outputs the version information for the program. This
includes the policy format version. This option does not
require any other arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--list-policies <br>
Outputs a list of the policies that passed the Selection
phase of the verification process. In other words, those
that could potentially verify the deb. The output is one
<br>
line showing the directory selected by the origin signature,
and then a single line for any policy files in that
directory that pass the Selection rules. This option will
<br>
NOT verify the deb.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--use-policy policy <br>
This option takes one argument, which is the name of the
policy file (as shown by the --list-policies option). Note,
this is just a file, and not a full path. You cannot <br>
specify arbitrary policies. This option is useful if more
than one policy applies to potentially verifying the deb.
The program will then use this policy, and only this <br>
policy, to try and verify the deb.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--policies-dir directory <br>
Use a different directory when looking up for policies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--keyrings-dir directory <br>
Use a different directory when looking up for keyrings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--root directory <br>
Use a different root directory when looking up for policies
and keyrings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
0 The requested operation completed successfully.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 General non-success exit
value. This occurs for non-verification operations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">10 Either no signatures are
contained in the deb or no origin signature was found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">11 An origin signature was
found, but it does not have a corresponding subdirectory in
the policies directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">12 The origin was found, and is
present. However, no policies were found that passed the
selection phase of the process. Thus, no verification was
performed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">13 The package failed the
verification phase of the process. More than likely, this
occurs due to a bad signature, or because not all criteria
of the verification block of <br>
the policy were passed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">14 An internal error occurred.
This is an unrecoverable error. Either the deb is corrupt,
gpg failed abnormally, or some other uncontrollable
failure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
DEBSIG_GNUPG_PROGRAM <br>
The name (or pathname) of the GnuPG program to use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/etc/debsig/policies/ <br>
Directory containing the policy (.pol) definitions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/debsig/policies/*/*.pol
<br>
XML format policy files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/usr/share/debsig/keyrings/ <br>
Directory containing the keyrings that coincide with the
policies.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">/usr/share/debsig/keyrings/*/*.gpg
<br>
GnuPG format keyrings for use by the policies.</p>
