<p>FAKETIME(1) wolfcw FAKETIME(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
faketime - manipulate the system time for a given
command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
faketime [options] timestamp program [arguments...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The given command will be tricked into believing that the
current system time is the one specified in the timestamp.
The wall clock will continue to run from this date and time
<br>
unless specified otherwise (see advanced options). Actually,
faketime is a simple wrapper for libfaketime, which uses the
LD_PRELOAD mechanism to load a small library which <br>
intercepts system calls to functions such as time(2) and
fstat(2). This wrapper exposes only a subset of
libfaketime&rsquo;s functionality; please refer to the
README file that came <br>
with faketime for more details and advanced options, or have
a look at http://github.com/wolfcw/libfaketime</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
--help show usage information and quit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
show version information and quit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m use the multi-threading
variant of libfaketime.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f use the advanced timestamp
specification format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
faketime &rsquo;last Friday 5 pm&rsquo; /bin/date <br>
faketime &rsquo;2008-12-24 08:15:42&rsquo; /bin/date <br>
faketime -f &rsquo;+2,5y x10,0&rsquo; /bin/bash -c
&rsquo;date; while true; do echo $SECONDS ; sleep 1 ;
done&rsquo; <br>
faketime -f &rsquo;+2,5y x0,50&rsquo; /bin/bash -c
&rsquo;date; while true; do echo $SECONDS ; sleep 1 ;
done&rsquo; <br>
faketime -f &rsquo;+2,5y i2,0&rsquo; /bin/bash -c
&rsquo;while true; do date ; sleep 1 ; done&rsquo; <br>
In this single case all spawned processes will use the same
global clock without restaring it at the start of each
process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(Please note that it depends on
your locale settings whether . or , has to be used for
fractional offsets)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ADVANCED TIMESTAMP FORMAT <br>
The simple timestamp format used by default applies the
/bin/date -d command to parse user-friendly specifications
such as &rsquo;last friday&rsquo;. When using the faketime
option -f, the <br>
timestamp specified on the command line is directly passed
to libfaketime, which enables a couple of additional
features such as speeding the clock up or slowing it down
for the <br>
target program. It is strongly recommended that you have a
look at the libfaketime documentation. Summary:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Freeze clock at absolute
timestamp: &quot;YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss&quot; <br>
If you want to specify an absolute point in time, exactly
this format must be used. Please note that freezing the
clock is usually not what you want and may break the <br>
application. Only use if you know what you&rsquo;re
doing!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Relative time offset:
&quot;[+/-]123[m/h/d/y], e.g. &quot;+60m&quot;,
&quot;+2y&quot; <br>
This is the most often used format and specifies the faked
time relatively to the current real time. The first
character of the format string must be a + or a -. The <br>
numeric value by default represents seconds, but the
modifiers m, h, d, and y can be used to specify minutes,
hours, days, or years, respectively. For example,
&quot;-2y&quot; means <br>
&quot;two years ago&quot;. Fractional time offsets can be
used, e.g. &quot;+2,5y&quot;, which means &quot;two and a
half years in the future&quot;. Please note that the
fraction delimiter depends on <br>
your locale settings, so if &quot;+2,5y&quot; does not work,
you might want to try &quot;+2.5y&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Start-at timestamps:
&quot;@YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss&quot; <br>
The wall clock will start counting at the given timestamp
for the program. This can be used for specifying absolute
timestamps without freezing the clock.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ADVANCED USAGE <br>
When using relative time offsets or start-at timestamps (see
ADVANCED TIMESTAMP FORMAT above and option -f), the clock
speed can be adjusted, i.e. time may run faster or slower
<br>
for the executed program. For example, &quot;+5y x10&quot;
will set the faked time 5 years into the future and make the
time pass 10 times as fast (one real second equals 10
seconds mea&acirc; <br>
sured by the program). Similarly, the flow of time can be
slowed, e.g. using &quot;-7d x0,2&quot;, which will set the
faked time 7 days in the past and set the clock speed to 20
percent, <br>
i.e. it takes five real world seconds for one second
measured by the program. Again, depending on your locale,
either &quot;x2.0&quot; or &quot;x2,0&quot; may be required
regarding the delimiter. <br>
You can also make faketime to advance the reported time by a
preset interval upon each time() call independently from the
system&rsquo;s time using &quot;-7d i2,0&quot;, where
&quot;i&quot; is followed by <br>
the increase interval in seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Faking times for multiple
programs or even system-wide can be simplified by using
~/.faketimerc files and /etc/faketimerc. Please refer to the
README that came with faketime for <br>
warnings and details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHOR <br>
Please see the README and NEWS files for contributers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Due to limitations of the LD_PRELOAD mechanism, faketime
will not work with suidroot and statically linked programs.
While timestamps and time offsets will work for child
pro&acirc; <br>
cesses, speeding the clock up or slowing it down might not
work for child processes spawned by the executed program as
expected; a new instance of libfaketime is used for each
<br>
child process, which means that the libfaketime start time,
which is used in speed adjustments, will also be
re-initialized. Some programs may dynamically load system
libraries, <br>
such as librt, at run-time and therefore bypass libfaketime.
You may report programs that do not work with libfaketime,
but only if they are available as open source.</p>
