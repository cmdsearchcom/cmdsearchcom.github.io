<b>faketime</b> <i>[options] timestamp program [arguments...]</i>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
The given command will be tricked into believing that the current system time is
  the one specified in the timestamp. The wall clock will continue to run from
  this date and time unless specified otherwise (see advanced options).
  Actually, faketime is a simple wrapper for libfaketime, which uses the
  LD_PRELOAD mechanism to load a small library which intercepts system calls to
  functions such as <i>time(2)</i> and <i>fstat(2)</i>. This wrapper exposes
  only a subset of libfaketime's functionality; please refer to the README file
  that came with faketime for more details and advanced options, or have a look
  at http://github.com/wolfcw/libfaketime

<pre>
faketime 'last Friday 5 pm' /bin/date
faketime '2008-12-24 08:15:42' /bin/date
faketime -f '+2,5y x10,0' /bin/bash -c 'date; while true; do echo $SECONDS ; sleep 1 ; done'
faketime -f '+2,5y x0,50' /bin/bash -c 'date; while true; do echo $SECONDS ; sleep 1 ; done'
faketime -f '+2,5y i2,0' /bin/bash -c 'while true; do date ; sleep 1 ; done'
In this single case all spawned processes will use the same global clock without restaring it at the start of each process.

(Please note that it depends on your locale settings whether . or , has to be used for fractional offsets)

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ADVANCED_TIMESTAMP_FORMAT"><a class="selflink" href="#ADVANCED_TIMESTAMP_FORMAT">ADVANCED
  TIMESTAMP FORMAT</a></h1>
The simple timestamp format used by default applies the <b>/bin/date -d</b>
  command to parse user-friendly specifications such as 'last friday'. When
  using the faketime option <b>-f</b>, the timestamp specified on the command
  line is directly passed to libfaketime, which enables a couple of additional
  features such as speeding the clock up or slowing it down for the target
  program. It is strongly recommended that you have a look at the libfaketime
  documentation. Summary:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">Freeze clock at absolute timestamp: <b>&quot;YYYY-MM-DD
    hh:mm:ss&quot;</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If you want to specify an absolute point in time, exactly
      this format must be used. Please note that freezing the clock is usually
      not what you want and may break the application. Only use if you know what
      you're doing!</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">Relative time offset: <b>&quot;[+/-]123[m/h/d/y]</b>, e.g.
    &quot;+60m&quot;, &quot;+2y&quot;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This is the most often used format and specifies the faked
      time relatively to the current real time. The first character of the
      format string <b>must</b> be a + or a -. The numeric value by default
      represents seconds, but the modifiers m, h, d, and y can be used to
      specify minutes, hours, days, or years, respectively. For example,
      &quot;-2y&quot; means &quot;two years ago&quot;. Fractional time offsets
      can be used, e.g. &quot;+2,5y&quot;, which means &quot;two and a half
      years in the future&quot;. Please note that the fraction delimiter depends
      on your locale settings, so if &quot;+2,5y&quot; does not work, you might
      want to try &quot;+2.5y&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">Start-at timestamps: <b>&quot;@YYYY-MM-DD
    hh:mm:ss&quot;</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The wall clock will start counting at the given timestamp
      for the program. This can be used for specifying absolute timestamps
      without freezing the clock.</dd>
</dl>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ADVANCED_USAGE"><a class="selflink" href="#ADVANCED_USAGE">ADVANCED
  USAGE</a></h1>
When using relative time offsets or start-at timestamps (see ADVANCED TIMESTAMP
  FORMAT above and option <b>-f</b>), the clock speed can be adjusted, i.e. time
  may run faster or slower for the executed program. For example, <b>&quot;+5y
  x10&quot;</b> will set the faked time 5 years into the future and make the
  time pass 10 times as fast (one real second equals 10 seconds measured by the
  program). Similarly, the flow of time can be slowed, e.g. using <b>&quot;-7d
  x0,2&quot;</b>, which will set the faked time 7 days in the past and set the
  clock speed to 20 percent, i.e. it takes five real world seconds for one
  second measured by the program. Again, depending on your locale, either
  &quot;x2.0&quot; or &quot;x2,0&quot; may be required regarding the delimiter.
  You can also make faketime to advance the reported time by a preset interval
  upon each time() call independently from the system's time using <b>&quot;-7d
  i2,0&quot;</b>, where <b>&quot;i&quot;</b> is followed by the increase
  interval in seconds.

Faking times for multiple programs or even system-wide can be simplified by
  using ~/.faketimerc files and /etc/faketimerc. Please refer to the README that
  came with faketime for warnings and details.

Due to limitations of the LD_PRELOAD mechanism, faketime will not work with
  suidroot and statically linked programs. While timestamps and time offsets
  will work for child processes, speeding the clock up or slowing it down might
  not work for child processes spawned by the executed program as expected; a
  new instance of libfaketime is used for each child process, which means that
  the libfaketime start time, which is used in speed adjustments, will also be
  re-initialized. Some programs may dynamically load system libraries, such as
  librt, at run-time and therefore bypass libfaketime. You may report programs
  that do not work with libfaketime, but only if they are available as open
  source.
