<p>DOTLOCKFILE(1) Cistron Utilities DOTLOCKFILE(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
dotlockfile - Utility to manage lockfiles</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
/usr/bin/dotlockfile [-p] [-c] [-m] [-l|-u|-t] [-r retries]
[lockfile]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Dotlockfile is a command line utility to safely create, test
and remove lockfiles. Lockfiles are created in an NFS-safe
way. Dotlockfile can can also be used to lock and unlock
<br>
mailboxes even if the mailspool directory is only writable
by group mail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The name dotlockfile comes from
the way mailboxes are locked for updates on a lot of UNIX
systems. A lockfile is created with the same filename as the
mailbox but with the string <br>
&quot;.lock&quot; appended.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The names dotlock and lockfile
were already taken - hence the name dotlockfile :).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-l Create a lockfile. This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u Remove a lockfile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Check for the existence of a
valid lockfile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Touch an existing lockfile
(update the timestamp).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p Write the process-id of the
calling process into the lockfile. Also when testing for an
existing lockfile, check the contents for a process-id to
find out if the lockfile <br>
is still valid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r retries <br>
The number of times dotlockfile retries to acquire the lock
if it failed the first time before giving up. The initial
sleep after failing to acquire the lock is 5 seconds. <br>
After each next try, a sleep of 5 seconds extra occurs up to
a maximum sleep of 60 seconds between tries. The default
number of retries is 5.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m Lock or unlock the current
users mailbox. The path to the mailbox is the default system
mailspool directory (usually /var/mail) with the username as
gotten from getpwuid() <br>
appended. If the environment variable $MAIL is set, that is
used instead. Then the string &quot;.lock&quot; is appended
to get the name of the actual lockfile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lockfile <br>
The lockfile to be created/removed, unless the -m option is
in effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RETURN VALUE <br>
Zero on success, and non-zero on failure. For the -c option,
sucess means that a valid lockfile is already present. When
locking (the default, or the -l option) dotlockfile <br>
returns the same values as the library function
lockfile_create(3). Unlocking a non-existant lockfile is not
an error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
The lockfile is created exactly as named on the command
line. The extension .lock is not automatically added.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This utility is a lot like the
lockfile(1) utility included with procmail, and the
mutt_dotlock(1) utility included with mutt. However the
command-line arguments differ, and so <br>
does the return status. It is believed that dotlockfile is
the most flexible implementation, since it automatically
detects when it needs to use priviliges to lock a mailbox,
and <br>
does it safely.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The above mentioned
lockfile_create(3) manpage is present in the liblockfile-dev
package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
None known.</p>
