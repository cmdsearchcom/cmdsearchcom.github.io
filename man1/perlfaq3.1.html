Have you looked at CPAN (see perlfaq2)? The chances are that someone has already
  written a module that can solve your problem. Have you read the appropriate

      a man-page but still useful, a collection of various essays on Perl
      techniques)</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
A crude table of contents for the Perl manpage set is found in perltoc.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="How_can_I_use_Perl_interactively?"><a class="selflink" href="#How_can_I_use_Perl_interactively?">How
  can I use Perl interactively?</a></h2>
The typical approach uses the Perl debugger, described in the
  <i>perldebug</i>(1) manpage, on an &quot;empty&quot; program, like this:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    perl -de 42
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Now just type in any legal Perl code, and it will be immediately evaluated. You
  can also examine the symbol table, get stack backtraces, check variable
  values, set breakpoints, and other operations typically found in symbolic
  debuggers.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can also use Devel::REPL which is an interactive shell for Perl, commonly
  known as a REPL - Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop. It provides various handy
  features.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="How_do_I_find_which_modules_are_installed_on_my_system?"><a class="selflink" href="#How_do_I_find_which_modules_are_installed_on_my_system?">How
  do I find which modules are installed on my system?</a></h2>
From the command line, you can use the &quot;cpan&quot; command's &quot;-l&quot;
  switch:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    $ cpan -l
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can also use &quot;cpan&quot;'s &quot;-a&quot; switch to create an
  autobundle file that &quot;CPAN.pm&quot; understands and can use to re-install
  every module:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    $ cpan -a
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Inside a Perl program, you can use the ExtUtils::Installed module to show all
  installed distributions, although it can take awhile to do its magic. The
  standard library which comes with Perl just shows up as &quot;Perl&quot;
  (although you can get those with Module::CoreList).
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    use ExtUtils::Installed;
    my $inst    = ExtUtils::Installed-&gt;new();
    my @modules = $inst-&gt;modules();
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you want a list of all of the Perl module filenames, you can use
  File::Find::Rule:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    use File::Find::Rule;
    my @files = File::Find::Rule-&gt;
        extras({follow =&gt; 1})-&gt;
        file()-&gt;
        name( '*.pm' )-&gt;
        in( @INC )
        ;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you do not have that module, you can do the same thing with File::Find which
  is part of the standard library:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    use File::Find;
    my @files;
    find(
        {
        wanted =&gt; sub {
            push @files, $File::Find::fullname
            if -f $File::Find::fullname &amp;&amp; /\.pm$/
        },
        follow =&gt; 1,
        follow_skip =&gt; 2,
        },
        @INC
    );
    print join &quot;\n&quot;, @files;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you simply need to check quickly to see if a module is available, you can
  check for its documentation. If you can read the documentation the module is
  most likely installed. If you cannot read the documentation, the module might
  not have any (in rare cases):
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    $ perldoc Module::Name
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can also try to include the module in a one-liner to see if perl finds it:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    $ perl -MModule::Name -e1
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
(If you don't receive a &quot;Can't locate ... in @INC&quot; error message, then
  Perl found the module name you asked for.)

  do I debug my Perl programs?</a></h2>
(contributed by brian d foy)
<div class="Pp"></div>
Before you do anything else, you can help yourself by ensuring that you let Perl
  tell you about problem areas in your code. By turning on warnings and
  strictures, you can head off many problems before they get too big. You can
  find out more about these in strict and warnings.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    #!/usr/bin/perl
    use strict;
    use warnings;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Beyond that, the simplest debugger is the &quot;print&quot; function. Use it to
  look at values as you run your program:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    print STDERR &quot;The value is [$value]\n&quot;;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The Data::Dumper module can pretty-print Perl data structures:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    use Data::Dumper qw( Dumper );
    print STDERR &quot;The hash is &quot; . Dumper( \%hash ) . &quot;\n&quot;;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Perl comes with an interactive debugger, which you can start with the
  &quot;-d&quot; switch. It's fully explained in perldebug.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you'd like a graphical user interface and you have Tk, you can use
  &quot;ptkdb&quot;. It's on CPAN and available for free.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you need something much more sophisticated and controllable, Leon Brocard's
  Devel::ebug (which you can call with the &quot;-D&quot; switch as
  &quot;-Debug&quot;) gives you the programmatic hooks into everything you need
  to write your own (without too much pain and suffering).
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can also use a commercial debugger such as Affrus (Mac OS X), Komodo from
  Activestate (Windows and Mac OS X), or EPIC (most platforms).
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="How_do_I_profile_my_Perl_programs?"><a class="selflink" href="#How_do_I_profile_my_Perl_programs?">How
  do I profile my Perl programs?</a></h2>
(contributed by brian d foy, updated Fri Jul 25 12:22:26 PDT 2008)
<div class="Pp"></div>
The &quot;Devel&quot; namespace has several modules which you can use to profile
  your Perl programs.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The Devel::NYTProf (New York Times Profiler) does both statement and subroutine
  profiling. It's available from CPAN and you also invoke it with the
  &quot;-d&quot; switch:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    perl -d:NYTProf some_perl.pl
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
It creates a database of the profile information that you can turn into reports.
  The &quot;nytprofhtml&quot; command turns the data into an HTML report similar
  to the Devel::Cover report:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    nytprofhtml
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
You might also be interested in using the Benchmark to measure and compare code
  snippets.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can read more about profiling in <i>Programming Perl</i>, chapter 20, or
  <i>Mastering Perl</i>, chapter 5.
<div class="Pp"></div>
perldebguts documents creating a custom debugger if you need to create a special
  sort of profiler. brian d foy describes the process in <i>The Perl
  Journal</i>, &quot;Creating a Perl Debugger&quot;,
  &lt;http://www.ddj.com/184404522&gt; , and &quot;Profiling in Perl&quot;
  &lt;http://www.ddj.com/184404580&gt; .
<div class="Pp"></div>
Perl.com has two interesting articles on profiling: &quot;Profiling Perl&quot;,
  by Simon Cozens, &lt;http://www.perl.com/lpt/a/850&gt; and &quot;Debugging and
  Profiling mod_perl Applications&quot;, by Frank Wiles,
  &lt;http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2006/02/09/debug_mod_perl.html&gt; .
<div class="Pp"></div>
Randal L. Schwartz writes about profiling in &quot;Speeding up Your Perl
  Programs&quot; for <i>Unix Review</i>,
  &lt;http://www.stonehenge.com/merlyn/UnixReview/col49.html&gt; , and
  &quot;Profiling in Template Toolkit via Overriding&quot; for <i>Linux

Perl::Tidy comes with a perl script perltidy which indents and reformats Perl
  scripts to make them easier to read by trying to follow the rules of the
  perlstyle. If you write Perl, or spend much time reading Perl, you will
  probably find it useful.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Of course, if you simply follow the guidelines in perlstyle, you shouldn't need
  to reformat. The habit of formatting your code as you write it will help
  prevent bugs. Your editor can and should help you with this. The perl-mode or
  newer cperl-mode for emacs can provide remarkable amounts of help with most
  (but not all) code, and even less programmable editors can provide significant
  assistance. Tom Christiansen and many other VI users swear by the following
  settings in vi and its clones:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    set ai sw=4
    map! ^O {^M}^[O^T
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Put that in your <i>.exrc</i> file (replacing the caret characters with control
  characters) and away you go. In insert mode, ^T is for indenting, ^D is for
  undenting, and ^O is for blockdenting--as it were. A more complete example,
  with comments, can be found at
  &lt;http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/TOMC/scripts/toms.exrc.gz&gt;

Perl programs are just plain text, so any editor will do.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you're on Unix, you already have an IDE--Unix itself. The Unix philosophy is
  the philosophy of several small tools that each do one thing and do it well.
  It's like a carpenter's toolbox.

For editors: if you're on Unix you probably have vi or a vi clone already, and
  possibly an emacs too, so you may not need to download anything. In any emacs
  the cperl-mode (M-x cperl-mode) gives you perhaps the best available Perl
  editing mode in any editor.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you are using Windows, you can use any editor that lets you work with plain
  text, such as NotePad or WordPad. Word processors, such as Microsoft Word or
  WordPerfect, typically do not work since they insert all sorts of
  behind-the-scenes information, although some allow you to save files as
  &quot;Text Only&quot;. You can also download text editors designed
  specifically for programming, such as Textpad (
  &lt;http://www.textpad.com/&gt; ) and UltraEdit (
  &lt;http://www.ultraedit.com/&gt; ), among others.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you are using MacOS, the same concerns apply. MacPerl (for Classic
  environments) comes with a simple editor. Popular external editors are BBEdit
  ( &lt;http://www.bbedit.com/&gt; ) or Alpha (
  &lt;http://www.his.com/~jguyer/Alpha/Alpha8.html&gt; ). MacOS X users can use
  Unix editors as well.

There are a number of modules which let you write GUIs in Perl. Most GUI

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">Tk</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This works under Unix and Windows, and the current version
      doesn't look half as bad under Windows as it used to. Some of the gui

      need a simple gui. It hasn't been updated in a while.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">Wx</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This is a Perl binding for the cross-platform wxWidgets

      the C++ interface closely, but the documentation is a little sparse for
      someone who doesn't know the library, mostly just referring you to the C++
      documentation.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">Gtk and Gtk2</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">These are Perl bindings for the Gtk toolkit (

      versions 1 and 2 so they have separate Perl modules. It runs under Unix,
      Win32 and Mac OS X (currently it requires an X server on Mac OS, but a
      'native' port is underway), and the widgets look the same on every
      platform: i.e., they don't match the native widgets. As with Wx, the Perl
      bindings follow the C API closely, and the documentation requires you to
      read the C documentation to understand it.</dd>

  <dd class="It-tag">This provides access to most of the Win32 GUI widgets from

      Perl interface doesn't really follow the C interface: it's been made more

The best way to do this is to come up with a better algorithm. This can often
  make a dramatic difference. Jon Bentley's book <i>Programming Pearls</i>
  (that's not a misspelling!) has some good tips on optimization, too. Advice on
  benchmarking boils down to: benchmark and profile to make sure you're
  optimizing the right part, look for better algorithms instead of microtuning
  your code, and when all else fails consider just buying faster hardware. You
  will probably want to read the answer to the earlier question &quot;How do I
  profile my Perl programs?&quot; if you haven't done so already.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A different approach is to autoload seldom-used Perl code. See the AutoSplit and
  AutoLoader modules in the standard distribution for that. Or you could locate
  the bottleneck and think about writing just that part in C, the way we used to
  take bottlenecks in C code and write them in assembler. Similar to rewriting
  in C, modules that have critical sections can be written in C (for instance,
  the PDL module from CPAN).
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you're currently linking your perl executable to a shared <i>libc.so</i>, you
  can often gain a 10-25% performance benefit by rebuilding it to link with a
  static libc.a instead. This will make a bigger perl executable, but your Perl
  programs (and programmers) may thank you for it. See the <i>INSTALL</i> file
  in the source distribution for more information.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The undump program was an ancient attempt to speed up Perl program by storing
  the already-compiled form to disk. This is no longer a viable option, as it
  only worked on a few architectures, and wasn't a good solution anyway.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="How_can_I_make_my_Perl_program_take_less_memory?"><a class="selflink" href="#How_can_I_make_my_Perl_program_take_less_memory?">How
  can I make my Perl program take less memory?</a></h2>
When it comes to time-space tradeoffs, Perl nearly always prefers to throw
  memory at a problem. Scalars in Perl use more memory than strings in C, arrays
  take more than that, and hashes use even more. While there's still a lot to be
  done, recent releases have been addressing these issues. For example, as of
  5.004, duplicate hash keys are shared amongst all hashes using them, so
  require no reallocation.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In some cases, using <i>substr()</i> or <i>vec()</i> to simulate arrays can be
  highly beneficial. For example, an array of a thousand booleans will take at
  least 20,000 bytes of space, but it can be turned into one 125-byte bit
  vector--a considerable memory savings. The standard Tie::SubstrHash module can
  also help for certain types of data structure. If you're working with
  specialist data structures (matrices, for instance) modules that implement
  these in C may use less memory than equivalent Perl modules.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Another thing to try is learning whether your Perl was compiled with the system
  malloc or with Perl's builtin malloc. Whichever one it is, try using the other
  one and see whether this makes a difference. Information about malloc is in
  the <i>INSTALL</i> file in the source distribution. You can find out whether
  you are using perl's malloc by typing &quot;perl -V:usemymalloc&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Of course, the best way to save memory is to not do anything to waste it in the
  first place. Good programming practices can go a long way toward this:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">Don't slurp!</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Don't read an entire file into memory if you can process it
      line by line. Or more concretely, use a loop like this:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    #
    # Good Idea
    #
    while (my $line = &lt;$file_handle&gt;) {
       # ...
    }
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    instead of this:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    #
    # Bad Idea
    #
    my @data = &lt;$file_handle&gt;;
    foreach (@data) {
        # ...
    }
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    When the files you're processing are small, it doesn't much matter which way
      you do it, but it makes a huge difference when they start getting
    larger.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">Use map and grep selectively</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Remember that both map and grep expect a LIST argument, so
      doing this:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
        @wanted = grep {/pattern/} &lt;$file_handle&gt;;
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    will cause the entire file to be slurped. For large files, it's better to
      loop:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
        while (&lt;$file_handle&gt;) {
                push(@wanted, $_) if /pattern/;
        }
    </pre>
  </dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">Avoid unnecessary quotes and stringification</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Don't quote large strings unless absolutely necessary:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
        my $copy = &quot;$large_string&quot;;
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    makes 2 copies of $large_string (one for $copy and another for the quotes),
      whereas
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
        my $copy = $large_string;
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    only makes one copy.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Ditto for stringifying large arrays:

    {
    local $, = &quot;\n&quot;;
    print @big_array;
    }
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>

    </pre>

      This requires some judgement, however, because any changes will be
      propagated back to the original data. If you really want to mangle (er,

You usually can't. Memory allocated to lexicals (i.e. <i>my()</i> variables)
  cannot be reclaimed or reused even if they go out of scope. It is reserved in
  case the variables come back into scope. Memory allocated to global variables
  can be reused (within your program) by using <i>undef()</i> and/or
  <i>delete()</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
On most operating systems, memory allocated to a program can never be returned
  to the system. That's why long-running programs sometimes re- exec themselves.
  Some operating systems (notably, systems that use <i>mmap</i>(2) for
  allocating large chunks of memory) can reclaim memory that is no longer used,
  but on such systems, perl must be configured and compiled to use the OS's
  malloc, not perl's.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In general, memory allocation and de-allocation isn't something you can or
  should be worrying about much in Perl.

Beyond the normal measures described to make general Perl programs faster or
  smaller, a CGI program has additional issues. It may be run several times per
  second. Given that each time it runs it will need to be re-compiled and will
  often allocate a megabyte or more of system memory, this can be a killer.
  Compiling into C <b>isn't going to help</b> <b>you</b> because the process
  start-up overhead is where the bottleneck is.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There are three popular ways to avoid this overhead. One solution involves
  running the Apache HTTP server (available from &lt;http://www.apache.org/&gt;
  ) with either of the mod_perl or mod_fastcgi plugin modules.
<div class="Pp"></div>
With mod_perl and the Apache::Registry module (distributed with mod_perl), httpd
  will run with an embedded Perl interpreter which pre-compiles your script and
  then executes it within the same address space without forking. The Apache
  extension also gives Perl access to the internal server API, so modules
  written in Perl can do just about anything a module written in C can. For more
  on mod_perl, see &lt;http://perl.apache.org/&gt;
<div class="Pp"></div>
With the FCGI module (from CPAN) and the mod_fastcgi module (available from
  &lt;http://www.fastcgi.com/&gt; ) each of your Perl programs becomes a
  permanent CGI daemon process.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Finally, Plack is a Perl module and toolkit that contains PSGI middleware,
  helpers and adapters to web servers, allowing you to easily deploy scripts
  which can continue running, and provides flexibility with regards to which web
  server you use. It can allow existing CGI scripts to enjoy this flexibility
  and performance with minimal changes, or can be used along with modern Perl
  web frameworks to make writing and deploying web services with Perl a breeze.
<div class="Pp"></div>
These solutions can have far-reaching effects on your system and on the way you
  write your CGI programs, so investigate them with care.

  can I hide the source for my Perl program?</a></h2>
Delete it. :-) Seriously, there are a number of (mostly unsatisfactory)
  solutions with varying levels of &quot;security&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
First of all, however, you <i>can't</i> take away read permission, because the
  source code has to be readable in order to be compiled and interpreted. (That
  doesn't mean that a CGI script's source is readable by people on the web,
  though--only by people with access to the filesystem.) So you have to leave
  the permissions at the socially friendly 0755 level.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Some people regard this as a security problem. If your program does insecure
  things and relies on people not knowing how to exploit those insecurities, it
  is not secure. It is often possible for someone to determine the insecure
  things and exploit them without viewing the source. Security through
  obscurity, the name for hiding your bugs instead of fixing them, is little
  security indeed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can try using encryption via source filters (Starting from Perl 5.8 the
  Filter::Simple and Filter::Util::Call modules are included in the standard
  distribution), but any decent programmer will be able to decrypt it. You can
  try using the byte code compiler and interpreter described later in perlfaq3,
  but the curious might still be able to de-compile it. You can try using the
  native-code compiler described later, but crackers might be able to
  disassemble it. These pose varying degrees of difficulty to people wanting to
  get at your code, but none can definitively conceal it (true of every
  language, not just Perl).
<div class="Pp"></div>
It is very easy to recover the source of Perl programs. You simply feed the
  program to the perl interpreter and use the modules in the B:: hierarchy. The
  B::Deparse module should be able to defeat most attempts to hide source.
  Again, this is not unique to Perl.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you're concerned about people profiting from your code, then the bottom line
  is that nothing but a restrictive license will give you legal security.
  License your software and pepper it with threatening statements like
  &quot;This is unpublished proprietary software of XYZ Corp. Your access to it
  does not give you permission to use it blah blah blah.&quot; We are not
  lawyers, of course, so you should see a lawyer if you want to be sure your
  license's wording will stand up in court.

In general, you can't do this. There are some things that may work for your

  distribute their works without giving away the source code, and most solutions
  trade disk space for convenience. You probably won't see much of a speed
  increase either, since most solutions simply bundle a Perl interpreter in the
  final product (but see &quot;How can I make my Perl program run
  faster?&quot;).

The Perl Archive Toolkit ( &lt;http://par.perl.org/&gt; ) is Perl's analog to
  Java's JAR. It's freely available and on CPAN (
  &lt;http://search.cpan.org/dist/PAR/&gt; ).
<div class="Pp"></div>
There are also some commercial products that may work for you, although you have
  to buy a license for them.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The Perl Dev Kit ( &lt;http://www.activestate.com/Products/Perl_Dev_Kit/&gt; )
  from ActiveState can &quot;Turn your Perl programs into ready-to-run
  executables for HP-UX, Linux, Solaris and Windows.&quot;
<div class="Pp"></div>
Perl2Exe ( &lt;http://www.indigostar.com/perl2exe.htm&gt; ) is a command line
  program for converting perl scripts to executable files. It targets both
  Windows and Unix platforms.

For OS/2 just use
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    extproc perl -S -your_switches
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
as the first line in &quot;*.cmd&quot; file (&quot;-S&quot; due to a bug in
  cmd.exe's &quot;extproc&quot; handling). For DOS one should first invent a
  corresponding batch file and codify it in &quot;ALTERNATE_SHEBANG&quot; (see
  the <i>dosish.h</i> file in the source distribution for more information).
<div class="Pp"></div>
The Win95/NT installation, when using the ActiveState port of Perl, will modify
  the Registry to associate the &quot;.pl&quot; extension with the perl
  interpreter. If you install another port, perhaps even building your own
  Win95/NT Perl from the standard sources by using a Windows port of gcc (e.g.,
  with cygwin or mingw32), then you'll have to modify the Registry yourself. In
  addition to associating &quot;.pl&quot; with the interpreter, NT people can
  use: &quot;SET PATHEXT=%PATHEXT%;.PL&quot; to let them run the program
  &quot;install-linux.pl&quot; merely by typing &quot;install-linux&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Under &quot;Classic&quot; MacOS, a perl program will have the appropriate
  Creator and Type, so that double-clicking them will invoke the MacPerl
  application. Under Mac OS X, clickable apps can be made from any
  &quot;#!&quot; script using Wil Sanchez' DropScript utility:
  &lt;http://www.wsanchez.net/software/&gt; .
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>IMPORTANT!</i>: Whatever you do, PLEASE don't get frustrated, and just throw
  the perl interpreter into your cgi-bin directory, in order to get your
  programs working for a web server. This is an EXTREMELY big security risk.
  Take the time to figure out how to do it correctly.

Yes. Read perlrun for more information. Some examples follow. (These assume
  standard Unix shell quoting rules.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    # sum first and last fields
    perl -lane 'print $F[0] + $F[-1]' *
    # identify text files
    perl -le 'for(@ARGV) {print if -f &amp;&amp; -T _}' *
    # remove (most) comments from C program
    perl -0777 -pe 's{/\*.*?\*/}{}gs' foo.c
    # make file a month younger than today, defeating reaper daemons
    perl -e '$X=24*60*60; utime(time(),time() + 30 * $X,@ARGV)' *
    # find first unused uid
    perl -le '$i++ while getpwuid($i); print $i'
    # display reasonable manpath
    echo $PATH | perl -nl -072 -e '
    s![^/+]*$!man!&amp;&amp;-d&amp;&amp;!$s{$_}++&amp;&amp;push@m,$_;END{print&quot;@m&quot;}'

OK, the last one was actually an Obfuscated Perl Contest entry. :-)

  don't Perl one-liners work on my DOS/Mac/VMS system?</a></h2>
The problem is usually that the command interpreters on those systems have
  rather different ideas about quoting than the Unix shells under which the
  one-liners were created. On some systems, you may have to change single-quotes
  to double ones, which you must <i>NOT</i> do on Unix or Plan9 systems. You
  might also have to change a single % to a %%.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For example:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    # Unix (including Mac OS X)
    perl -e 'print &quot;Hello world\n&quot;'
    # DOS, etc.
    perl -e &quot;print \&quot;Hello world\n\&quot;&quot;
    # Mac Classic
    print &quot;Hello world\n&quot;
     (then Run &quot;Myscript&quot; or Shift-Command-R)
    # MPW
    perl -e 'print &quot;Hello world\n&quot;'
    # VMS
    perl -e &quot;print &quot;&quot;Hello world\n&quot;&quot;&quot;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The problem is that none of these examples are reliable: they depend on the
  command interpreter. Under Unix, the first two often work. Under DOS, it's
  entirely possible that neither works. If 4DOS was the command shell, you'd
  probably have better luck like this:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  perl -e &quot;print &lt;Ctrl-x&gt;&quot;Hello world\n&lt;Ctrl-x&gt;&quot;&quot;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Under the Mac, it depends which environment you are using. The MacPerl shell, or
  MPW, is much like Unix shells in its support for several quoting variants,
  except that it makes free use of the Mac's non-ASCII characters as control
  characters.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Using <i>qq()</i>, q(), and <i>qx()</i>, instead of &quot;double quotes&quot;,
  'single quotes', and `backticks`, may make one-liners easier to write.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There is no general solution to all of this. It is a mess.

For modules, get the CGI or LWP modules from CPAN. For textbooks, see the two
  especially dedicated to web stuff in the question on books. For problems and
  questions related to the web, like &quot;Why do I get 500 Errors&quot; or
  &quot;Why doesn't it run from the browser right when it runs fine on the
  command line&quot;, see the troubleshooting guides and references in perlfaq9
  or in the CGI MetaFAQ:

Looking in to Plack and modern Perl web frameworks is highly recommended,
  though; web programming in Perl has evolved a long way from the old days of
  simple CGI scripts.

A good place to start is perltoot, and you can use perlobj, perlboot, perltoot,
  perltooc, and perlbot for reference.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A good book on OO on Perl is the &quot;Object-Oriented Perl&quot; by Damian
  Conway from Manning Publications, or &quot;Intermediate Perl&quot; by Randal
  Schwartz, brian d foy, and Tom Phoenix from O'Reilly Media.

If you want to call C from Perl, start with perlxstut, moving on to perlxs,
  xsubpp, and perlguts. If you want to call Perl from C, then read perlembed,
  perlcall, and perlguts. Don't forget that you can learn a lot from looking at
  how the authors of existing extension modules wrote their code and solved
  their problems.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You might not need all the power of XS. The Inline::C module lets you put C code
  directly in your Perl source. It handles all the magic to make it work. You
  still have to learn at least some of the perl API but you won't have to deal
  with the complexity of the XS support files.

Download the ExtUtils::Embed kit from CPAN and run `make test'. If the tests
  pass, read the pods again and again and again. If they fail, see perlbug and
  send a bug report with the output of &quot;make test TEST_VERBOSE=1&quot;
  along with &quot;perl -V&quot;.

A complete list of Perl's error messages and warnings with explanatory text can
  be found in perldiag. You can also use the splain program (distributed with
  Perl) to explain the error messages:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    perl program 2&gt;diag.out
    splain [-v] [-p] diag.out
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
or change your program to explain the messages for you:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    use diagnostics;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
or
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    use diagnostics -verbose;

(contributed by brian d foy)
<div class="Pp"></div>
The ExtUtils::MakeMaker module, better known simply as &quot;MakeMaker&quot;,
  turns a Perl script, typically called &quot;Makefile.PL&quot;, into a
  Makefile. The Unix tool &quot;make&quot; uses this file to manage dependencies
  and actions to process and install a Perl distribution.
