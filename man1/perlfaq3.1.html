Various <br>
&lt;http://www.cpan.org/misc/olddoc/FMTEYEWTK.tgz&gt; (not a
man-page but still useful, a collection of various essays on
Perl techniques)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A crude table of contents for
the Perl manpage set is found in perltoc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">How can I use Perl
interactively? <br>
The typical approach uses the Perl debugger, described in
the perldebug(1) manpage, on an &quot;empty&quot; program,
like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perl -de 42</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Now just type in any legal Perl
code, and it will be immediately evaluated. You can also
examine the symbol table, get stack backtraces, check
variable values, set breakpoints, <br>
and other operations typically found in symbolic
debuggers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also use Devel::REPL
which is an interactive shell for Perl, commonly known as a
REPL - Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop. It provides various
handy features.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">How do I find which modules are
installed on my system? <br>
From the command line, you can use the &quot;cpan&quot;
command&rsquo;s &quot;-l&quot; switch:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ cpan -l</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also use
&quot;cpan&quot;&rsquo;s &quot;-a&quot; switch to create an
autobundle file that &quot;CPAN.pm&quot; understands and can
use to re-install every module:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ cpan -a</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Inside a Perl program, you can
use the ExtUtils::Installed module to show all installed
distributions, although it can take awhile to do its magic.
The standard library which <br>
comes with Perl just shows up as &quot;Perl&quot; (although
you can get those with Module::CoreList).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use ExtUtils::Installed;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">my $inst =
ExtUtils::Installed-&gt;new(); <br>
my @modules = $inst-&gt;modules();</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want a list of all of the
Perl module filenames, you can use File::Find::Rule:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use File::Find::Rule;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">my @files =
File::Find::Rule-&gt; <br>
extras({follow =&gt; 1})-&gt; <br>
file()-&gt; <br>
name( &rsquo;*.pm&rsquo; )-&gt; <br>
in( @INC ) <br>
;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you do not have that module,
you can do the same thing with File::Find which is part of
the standard library:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use File::Find; <br>
my @files;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">find( <br>
{ <br>
wanted =&gt; sub { <br>
push @files, $File::Find::fullname <br>
if -f $File::Find::fullname &amp;&amp; /.pm$/ <br>
}, <br>
follow =&gt; 1, <br>
follow_skip =&gt; 2, <br>
}, <br>
@INC <br>
);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print join &quot;0, @files;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you simply need to check
quickly to see if a module is available, you can check for
its documentation. If you can read the documentation the
module is most likely installed. <br>
If you cannot read the documentation, the module might not
have any (in rare cases):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ perldoc Module::Name</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also try to include the
module in a one-liner to see if perl finds it:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ perl -MModule::Name -e1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(If you don&rsquo;t receive a
&quot;Can&rsquo;t locate ... in @INC&quot; error message,
then Perl found the module name you asked for.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">How do I debug my Perl programs?
<br>
(contributed by brian d foy)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Before you do anything else, you
can help yourself by ensuring that you let Perl tell you
about problem areas in your code. By turning on warnings and
strictures, you can head <br>
off many problems before they get too big. You can find out
more about these in strict and warnings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#!/usr/bin/perl <br>
use strict; <br>
use warnings;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Beyond that, the simplest
debugger is the &quot;print&quot; function. Use it to look
at values as you run your program:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print STDERR &quot;The value is
[$value]0;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Data::Dumper module can
pretty-print Perl data structures:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use Data::Dumper qw( Dumper );
<br>
print STDERR &quot;The hash is &quot; . Dumper( hash ) .
&quot;0;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl comes with an interactive
debugger, which you can start with the &quot;-d&quot;
switch. It&rsquo;s fully explained in perldebug.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you&rsquo;d like a graphical
user interface and you have Tk, you can use
&quot;ptkdb&quot;. It&rsquo;s on CPAN and available for
free.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you need something much more
sophisticated and controllable, Leon Brocard&rsquo;s
Devel::ebug (which you can call with the &quot;-D&quot;
switch as &quot;-Debug&quot;) gives you the programmatic
hooks <br>
into everything you need to write your own (without too much
pain and suffering).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also use a commercial
debugger such as Affrus (Mac OS X), Komodo from Activestate
(Windows and Mac OS X), or EPIC (most platforms).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">How do I profile my Perl
programs? <br>
(contributed by brian d foy, updated Fri Jul 25 12:22:26 PDT
2008)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;Devel&quot; namespace
has several modules which you can use to profile your Perl
programs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Devel::NYTProf (New York
Times Profiler) does both statement and subroutine
profiling. It&rsquo;s available from CPAN and you also
invoke it with the &quot;-d&quot; switch:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perl -d:NYTProf some_perl.pl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It creates a database of the
profile information that you can turn into reports. The
&quot;nytprofhtml&quot; command turns the data into an HTML
report similar to the Devel::Cover report:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nytprofhtml</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You might also be interested in
using the Benchmark to measure and compare code
snippets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can read more about
profiling in Programming Perl, chapter 20, or Mastering
Perl, chapter 5.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perldebguts documents creating a
custom debugger if you need to create a special sort of
profiler. brian d foy describes the process in The Perl
Journal, &quot;Creating a Perl <br>
Debugger&quot;, &lt;http://www.ddj.com/184404522&gt; , and
&quot;Profiling in Perl&quot;
&lt;http://www.ddj.com/184404580&gt; .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl.com has two interesting
articles on profiling: &quot;Profiling Perl&quot;, by Simon
Cozens, &lt;http://www.perl.com/lpt/a/850&gt; and
&quot;Debugging and Profiling mod_perl Applications&quot;,
by <br>
Frank Wiles,
&lt;http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2006/02/09/debug_mod_perl.html&gt;
.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Randal L. Schwartz writes about
profiling in &quot;Speeding up Your Perl Programs&quot; for
Unix Review,
&lt;http://www.stonehenge.com/merlyn/UnixReview/col49.html&gt;
, and &quot;Profiling in <br>
Template Toolkit via Overriding&quot; for Linux Magazine,
&lt;http://www.stonehenge.com/merlyn/LinuxMag/col75.html&gt;
.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">How do I cross-reference my Perl
programs? <br>
The B::Xref module can be used to generate cross-reference
reports for Perl programs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perl -MO=Xref[,OPTIONS]
scriptname.plx</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Is there a pretty-printer
(formatter) for Perl? <br>
Perl::Tidy comes with a perl script perltidy which indents
and reformats Perl scripts to make them easier to read by
trying to follow the rules of the perlstyle. If you write
<br>
Perl, or spend much time reading Perl, you will probably
find it useful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Of course, if you simply follow
the guidelines in perlstyle, you shouldn&rsquo;t need to
reformat. The habit of formatting your code as you write it
will help prevent bugs. Your editor <br>
can and should help you with this. The perl-mode or newer
cperl-mode for emacs can provide remarkable amounts of help
with most (but not all) code, and even less programmable
<br>
editors can provide significant assistance. Tom Christiansen
and many other VI users swear by the following settings in
vi and its clones:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set ai sw=4 <br>
map! ^O {^M}^[O^T</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Put that in your .exrc file
(replacing the caret characters with control characters) and
away you go. In insert mode, ^T is for indenting, ^D is for
undenting, and ^O is for <br>
blockdenting--as it were. A more complete example, with
comments, can be found at
&lt;http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/TOMC/scripts/toms.exrc.gz&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Is there an IDE or Windows Perl
Editor? <br>
Perl programs are just plain text, so any editor will
do.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you&rsquo;re on Unix, you
already have an IDE--Unix itself. The Unix philosophy is the
philosophy of several small tools that each do one thing and
do it well. It&rsquo;s like a <br>
carpenter&rsquo;s toolbox.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want an IDE, check the
following (in alphabetical order, not order of
preference):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Eclipse <br>
http://e-p-i-c.sf.net/ &lt;http://e-p-i-c.sf.net/&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Eclipse Perl Integration
Project integrates Perl editing/debugging with Eclipse.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enginsite <br>
&lt;http://www.enginsite.com/&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl Editor by EngInSite is a
complete integrated development environment (IDE) for
creating, testing, and debugging Perl scripts; the tool runs
on Windows 9x/NT/2000/XP or <br>
later.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Komodo <br>
&lt;http://www.ActiveState.com/Products/Komodo/&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ActiveState&rsquo;s
cross-platform (as of October 2004, that&rsquo;s Windows,
Linux, and Solaris), multi-language IDE has Perl support,
including a regular expression debugger and remote <br>
debugging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Notepad++ <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OptiPerl is a Windows IDE with
simulated CGI environment, including debugger and
syntax-highlighting editor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Padre <br>
&lt;http://padre.perlide.org/&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Padre is cross-platform IDE for
Perl written in Perl using wxWidgets to provide a native
look and feel. It&rsquo;s open source under the Artistic
License. It is one of the newer <br>
Perl IDEs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PerlBuilder <br>
&lt;http://www.solutionsoft.com/perl.htm&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PerlBuilder is an integrated
development environment for Windows that supports Perl
development.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">visiPerl+ <br>
&lt;http://helpconsulting.net/visiperl/index.html&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">From Help Consulting, for
Windows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Visual Perl <br>

&lt;http://www.activestate.com/Products/Visual_Perl/&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Visual Perl is a Visual
Studio.NET plug-in from ActiveState.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Zeus <br>
&lt;http://www.zeusedit.com/lookmain.html&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Zeus for Window is another Win32
multi-language editor/IDE that comes with support for
Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For editors: if you&rsquo;re on
Unix you probably have vi or a vi clone already, and
possibly an emacs too, so you may not need to download
anything. In any emacs the cperl-mode (M-x <br>
cperl-mode) gives you perhaps the best available Perl
editing mode in any editor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are using Windows, you
can use any editor that lets you work with plain text, such
as NotePad or WordPad. Word processors, such as Microsoft
Word or WordPerfect, typically <br>
do not work since they insert all sorts of behind-the-scenes
information, although some allow you to save files as
&quot;Text Only&quot;. You can also download text editors
designed <br>
specifically for programming, such as Textpad (
&lt;http://www.textpad.com/&gt; ) and UltraEdit (
&lt;http://www.ultraedit.com/&gt; ), among others.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are using MacOS, the same
concerns apply. MacPerl (for Classic environments) comes
with a simple editor. Popular external editors are BBEdit (
&lt;http://www.bbedit.com/&gt; ) <br>
or Alpha (
&lt;http://www.his.com/~jguyer/Alpha/Alpha8.html&gt; ).
MacOS X users can use Unix editors as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GNU Emacs <br>

&lt;http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/windows/ntemacs.html&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MicroEMACS <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Vim
&lt;http://www.vim.org/&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Vile <br>
&lt;http://dickey.his.com/vile/vile.html&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following are Win32
multilanguage editor/IDEs that support Perl:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Codewright <br>
&lt;http://www.borland.com/codewright/&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MultiEdit <br>

&lt;http://www.slickedit.com/&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ConTEXT <br>
&lt;http://www.contexteditor.org/&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is also a toyedit Text
widget based editor written in Perl that is distributed with
the Tk module on CPAN. The ptkdb (
&lt;http://ptkdb.sourceforge.net/&gt; ) is a Perl/Tk-based
<br>
debugger that acts as a development environment of sorts.
Perl Composer ( &lt;http://perlcomposer.sourceforge.net/&gt;
) is an IDE for Perl/Tk GUI creation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition to an editor/IDE you
might be interested in a more powerful shell environment for
Win32. Your options include</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bash <br>
from the Cygwin package (
&lt;http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/&gt; )</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ksh from the MKS Toolkit (
&lt;http://www.mkssoftware.com/&gt; ), or the Bourne shell
of the U/WIN environment (
&lt;http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/uwin/&gt; )</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tcsh <br>
&lt;ftp://ftp.astron.com/pub/tcsh/&gt; , see also
http://www.primate.wisc.edu/software/csh-tcsh-book/
&lt;http://www.primate.wisc.edu/software/csh-tcsh-book/&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Zsh
&lt;http://www.zsh.org/&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MKS and U/WIN are commercial
(U/WIN is free for educational and research purposes),
Cygwin is covered by the GNU General Public License (but
that shouldn&rsquo;t matter for Perl use). <br>
The Cygwin, MKS, and U/WIN all contain (in addition to the
shells) a comprehensive set of standard Unix toolkit
utilities.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you&rsquo;re transferring
text files between Unix and Windows using FTP be sure to
transfer them in ASCII mode so the ends of lines are
appropriately converted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On Mac OS the MacPerl
Application comes with a simple 32k text editor that behaves
like a rudimentary IDE. In contrast to the MacPerl
Application the MPW Perl tool can make use <br>
of the MPW Shell itself as an editor (with no 32k
limit).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Affrus <br>
is a full Perl development environment with full debugger
support ( &lt;http://www.latenightsw.com&gt; ).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alpha <br>
is an editor, written and extensible in Tcl, that
nonetheless has built-in support for several popular markup
and programming languages, including Perl and HTML ( <br>
&lt;http://www.his.com/~jguyer/Alpha/Alpha8.html&gt; ).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BBEdit and BBEdit Lite <br>
are text editors for Mac OS that have a Perl sensitivity
mode ( &lt;http://web.barebones.com/&gt; ).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Where can I get Perl macros for
vi? <br>
For a complete version of Tom Christiansen&rsquo;s vi
configuration file, see
&lt;http://www.cpan.org/authors/Tom_Christiansen/scripts/toms.exrc.gz&gt;
, the standard benchmark file for vi <br>
emulators. The file runs best with nvi, the current version
of vi out of Berkeley, which incidentally can be built with
an embedded Perl interpreter--see <br>
&lt;http://www.cpan.org/src/misc/&gt; .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Where can I get perl-mode or
cperl-mode for emacs? <br>
Since Emacs version 19 patchlevel 22 or so, there have been
both a perl-mode.el and support for the Perl debugger built
in. These should come with the standard Emacs 19 <br>
distribution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the perl-mode of emacs
will have fits with &quot;main&rsquo;foo&quot; (single
quote), and mess up the indentation and highlighting. You
are probably using &quot;main::foo&quot; in new Perl code
<br>
anyway, so this shouldn&rsquo;t be an issue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For CPerlMode, see
http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/CPerlMode
&lt;http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/CPerlMode&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">How can I use curses with Perl?
<br>
The Curses module from CPAN provides a dynamically loadable
object module interface to a curses library. A small demo
can be found at the directory <br>

&lt;http://www.cpan.org/authors/Tom_Christiansen/scripts/rep.gz&gt;
; this program repeats a command and updates the screen as
needed, rendering rep ps axu similar to top.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">How can I write a GUI (X, Tk,
Gtk, etc.) in Perl? <br>
(contributed by Ben Morrow)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are a number of modules
which let you write GUIs in Perl. Most GUI toolkits have a
perl interface: an incomplete list follows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tk This works under Unix and
Windows, and the current version doesn&rsquo;t look half as
bad under Windows as it used to. Some of the gui elements
still don&rsquo;t &rsquo;feel&rsquo; quite right, <br>
though. The interface is very natural and
&rsquo;perlish&rsquo;, making it easy to use in small
scripts that just need a simple gui. It hasn&rsquo;t been
updated in a while.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Wx This is a Perl binding for
the cross-platform wxWidgets toolkit (
&lt;http://www.wxwidgets.org&gt; ). It works under Unix,
Win32 and Mac OS X, using native widgets (Gtk under <br>
Unix). The interface follows the C++ interface closely, but
the documentation is a little sparse for someone who
doesn&rsquo;t know the library, mostly just referring you to
the <br>
C++ documentation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Gtk and Gtk2 <br>
These are Perl bindings for the Gtk toolkit (
&lt;http://www.gtk.org&gt; ). The interface changed
significantly between versions 1 and 2 so they have separate
Perl modules. It runs <br>
under Unix, Win32 and Mac OS X (currently it requires an X
server on Mac OS, but a &rsquo;native&rsquo; port is
underway), and the widgets look the same on every platform:
i.e., they <br>
don&rsquo;t match the native widgets. As with Wx, the Perl
bindings follow the C API closely, and the documentation
requires you to read the C documentation to understand
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Win32::GUI <br>
This provides access to most of the Win32 GUI widgets from
Perl. Obviously, it only runs under Win32, and uses native
widgets. The Perl interface doesn&rsquo;t really follow the
C <br>
interface: it&rsquo;s been made more Perlish, and the
documentation is pretty good. More advanced stuff may
require familiarity with the C Win32 APIs, or reference to

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CamelBones <br>
CamelBones ( &lt;http://camelbones.sourceforge.net&gt; ) is
a Perl interface to Mac OS X&rsquo;s Cocoa GUI toolkit, and
as such can be used to produce native GUIs on Mac OS X.
It&rsquo;s not <br>
on CPAN, as it requires frameworks that CPAN.pm
doesn&rsquo;t know how to install, but installation is via
the standard OSX package installer. The Perl API is, again,
very close to <br>
the ObjC API it&rsquo;s wrapping, and the documentation just
tells you how to translate from one to the other.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Qt There is a Perl interface to
TrollTech&rsquo;s Qt toolkit, but it does not appear to be
maintained.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Athena <br>
Sx is an interface to the Athena widget set which comes with
X, but again it appears not to be much used nowadays.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">How can I make my Perl program
run faster? <br>
The best way to do this is to come up with a better
algorithm. This can often make a dramatic difference. Jon
Bentley&rsquo;s book Programming Pearls (that&rsquo;s not a
misspelling!) has <br>
some good tips on optimization, too. Advice on benchmarking
boils down to: benchmark and profile to make sure
you&rsquo;re optimizing the right part, look for better
algorithms instead <br>
of microtuning your code, and when all else fails consider
just buying faster hardware. You will probably want to read
the answer to the earlier question &quot;How do I profile my
<br>
Perl programs?&quot; if you haven&rsquo;t done so
already.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A different approach is to
autoload seldom-used Perl code. See the AutoSplit and
AutoLoader modules in the standard distribution for that. Or
you could locate the bottleneck and <br>
think about writing just that part in C, the way we used to
take bottlenecks in C code and write them in assembler.
Similar to rewriting in C, modules that have critical
sections <br>
can be written in C (for instance, the PDL module from
CPAN).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you&rsquo;re currently
linking your perl executable to a shared libc.so, you can
often gain a 10-25% performance benefit by rebuilding it to
link with a static libc.a instead. This <br>
will make a bigger perl executable, but your Perl programs
(and programmers) may thank you for it. See the INSTALL file
in the source distribution for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The undump program was an
ancient attempt to speed up Perl program by storing the
already-compiled form to disk. This is no longer a viable
option, as it only worked on a few <br>
architectures, and wasn&rsquo;t a good solution anyway.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">How can I make my Perl program
take less memory? <br>
When it comes to time-space tradeoffs, Perl nearly always
prefers to throw memory at a problem. Scalars in Perl use
more memory than strings in C, arrays take more than that,
and <br>
hashes use even more. While there&rsquo;s still a lot to be
done, recent releases have been addressing these issues. For
example, as of 5.004, duplicate hash keys are shared amongst
<br>
all hashes using them, so require no reallocation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In some cases, using substr() or
vec() to simulate arrays can be highly beneficial. For
example, an array of a thousand booleans will take at least
20,000 bytes of space, but it <br>
can be turned into one 125-byte bit vector--a considerable
memory savings. The standard Tie::SubstrHash module can also
help for certain types of data structure. If you&rsquo;re
<br>
working with specialist data structures (matrices, for
instance) modules that implement these in C may use less
memory than equivalent Perl modules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another thing to try is learning
whether your Perl was compiled with the system malloc or
with Perl&rsquo;s builtin malloc. Whichever one it is, try
using the other one and see whether <br>
this makes a difference. Information about malloc is in the
INSTALL file in the source distribution. You can find out
whether you are using perl&rsquo;s malloc by typing
&quot;perl <br>
-V:usemymalloc&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Of course, the best way to save
memory is to not do anything to waste it in the first place.
Good programming practices can go a long way toward
this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Don&rsquo;t slurp! <br>
Don&rsquo;t read an entire file into memory if you can
process it line by line. Or more concretely, use a loop like
this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># <br>
# Good Idea <br>
# <br>
while (my $line = &lt;$file_handle&gt;) { <br>
# ... <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">instead of this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># <br>
# Bad Idea <br>
# <br>
my @data = &lt;$file_handle&gt;; <br>
foreach (@data) { <br>
# ... <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the files you&rsquo;re
processing are small, it doesn&rsquo;t much matter which way
you do it, but it makes a huge difference when they start
getting larger.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use map and grep selectively
<br>
Remember that both map and grep expect a LIST argument, so
doing this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@wanted = grep {/pattern/}
&lt;$file_handle&gt;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will cause the entire file to be
slurped. For large files, it&rsquo;s better to loop:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">while (&lt;$file_handle&gt;) {
<br>
push(@wanted, $_) if /pattern/; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Avoid unnecessary quotes and
stringification <br>
Don&rsquo;t quote large strings unless absolutely
necessary:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">my $copy =
&quot;$large_string&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">makes 2 copies of $large_string
(one for $copy and another for the quotes), whereas</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">my $copy = $large_string;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">only makes one copy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ditto for stringifying large
arrays:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">{ <br>
local $, = &quot;0; <br>
print @big_array; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">is much more memory-efficient
than either</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print join &quot;0,
@big_array;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">{ <br>
local $&quot; = &quot;0; <br>
print &quot;@big_array&quot;; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pass by reference <br>
Pass arrays and hashes by reference, not by value. For one
thing, it&rsquo;s the only way to pass multiple lists or
hashes (or both) in a single call/return. It also avoids
<br>
creating a copy of all the contents. This requires some
judgement, however, because any changes will be propagated
back to the original data. If you really want to mangle <br>
(er, modify) a copy, you&rsquo;ll have to sacrifice the
memory needed to make one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tie large variables to disk <br>
For &quot;big&quot; data stores (i.e. ones that exceed
available memory) consider using one of the DB modules to
store it on disk instead of in RAM. This will incur a
penalty in access <br>
time, but that&rsquo;s probably better than causing your
hard disk to thrash due to massive swapping.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Is it safe to return a reference
to local or lexical data? <br>
Yes. Perl&rsquo;s garbage collection system takes care of
this so everything works out right.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sub makeone { <br>
my @a = ( 1 .. 10 ); <br>
return @a; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">for ( 1 .. 10 ) { <br>
push @many, makeone(); <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print $many[4][5], &quot;0;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print &quot;@many0;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">How can I free an array or hash
so my program shrinks? <br>
(contributed by Michael Carman)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You usually can&rsquo;t. Memory
allocated to lexicals (i.e. my() variables) cannot be
reclaimed or reused even if they go out of scope. It is
reserved in case the variables come back <br>
into scope. Memory allocated to global variables can be
reused (within your program) by using undef() and/or
delete().</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On most operating systems,
memory allocated to a program can never be returned to the
system. That&rsquo;s why long-running programs sometimes re-
exec themselves. Some operating <br>
systems (notably, systems that use mmap(2) for allocating
large chunks of memory) can reclaim memory that is no longer
used, but on such systems, perl must be configured and <br>
compiled to use the OS&rsquo;s malloc, not perl&rsquo;s.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In general, memory allocation
and de-allocation isn&rsquo;t something you can or should be
worrying about much in Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See also &quot;How can I make my
Perl program take less memory?&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">How can I make my CGI script
more efficient? <br>
Beyond the normal measures described to make general Perl
programs faster or smaller, a CGI program has additional
issues. It may be run several times per second. Given that
each <br>
time it runs it will need to be re-compiled and will often
allocate a megabyte or more of system memory, this can be a
killer. Compiling into C isn&rsquo;t going to help you
because <br>
the process start-up overhead is where the bottleneck
is.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are three popular ways to
avoid this overhead. One solution involves running the
Apache HTTP server (available from
&lt;http://www.apache.org/&gt; ) with either of the mod_perl
<br>
or mod_fastcgi plugin modules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With mod_perl and the
Apache::Registry module (distributed with mod_perl), httpd
will run with an embedded Perl interpreter which
pre-compiles your script and then executes it <br>
within the same address space without forking. The Apache
extension also gives Perl access to the internal server API,
so modules written in Perl can do just about anything a <br>
module written in C can. For more on mod_perl, see
&lt;http://perl.apache.org/&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With the FCGI module (from CPAN)
and the mod_fastcgi module (available from
&lt;http://www.fastcgi.com/&gt; ) each of your Perl programs
becomes a permanent CGI daemon process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, Plack is a Perl module
and toolkit that contains PSGI middleware, helpers and
adapters to web servers, allowing you to easily deploy
scripts which can continue running, <br>
and provides flexibility with regards to which web server
you use. It can allow existing CGI scripts to enjoy this
flexibility and performance with minimal changes, or can be
<br>
used along with modern Perl web frameworks to make writing
and deploying web services with Perl a breeze.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These solutions can have
far-reaching effects on your system and on the way you write
your CGI programs, so investigate them with care.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">How can I hide the source for my
Perl program? <br>
Delete it. :-) Seriously, there are a number of (mostly
unsatisfactory) solutions with varying levels of
&quot;security&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">First of all, however, you
can&rsquo;t take away read permission, because the source
code has to be readable in order to be compiled and
interpreted. (That doesn&rsquo;t mean that a CGI <br>
script&rsquo;s source is readable by people on the web,
though--only by people with access to the filesystem.) So
you have to leave the permissions at the socially friendly
0755 <br>
level.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some people regard this as a
security problem. If your program does insecure things and
relies on people not knowing how to exploit those
insecurities, it is not secure. It is <br>
often possible for someone to determine the insecure things
and exploit them without viewing the source. Security
through obscurity, the name for hiding your bugs instead of
<br>
fixing them, is little security indeed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can try using encryption via
source filters (Starting from Perl 5.8 the Filter::Simple
and Filter::Util::Call modules are included in the standard
distribution), but any <br>
decent programmer will be able to decrypt it. You can try
using the byte code compiler and interpreter described later
in perlfaq3, but the curious might still be able to de- <br>
compile it. You can try using the native-code compiler
described later, but crackers might be able to disassemble
it. These pose varying degrees of difficulty to people
wanting <br>
to get at your code, but none can definitively conceal it
(true of every language, not just Perl).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is very easy to recover the
source of Perl programs. You simply feed the program to the
perl interpreter and use the modules in the B:: hierarchy.
The B::Deparse module should <br>
be able to defeat most attempts to hide source. Again, this
is not unique to Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you&rsquo;re concerned about
people profiting from your code, then the bottom line is
that nothing but a restrictive license will give you legal
security. License your software and <br>
pepper it with threatening statements like &quot;This is
unpublished proprietary software of XYZ Corp. Your access to
it does not give you permission to use it blah blah
blah.&quot; We <br>
are not lawyers, of course, so you should see a lawyer if
you want to be sure your license&rsquo;s wording will stand
up in court.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">How can I compile my Perl
program into byte code or C? <br>
(contributed by brian d foy)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In general, you can&rsquo;t do
this. There are some things that may work for your situation
though. People usually ask this question because they want
to distribute their works without <br>
giving away the source code, and most solutions trade disk
space for convenience. You probably won&rsquo;t see much of
a speed increase either, since most solutions simply bundle
a <br>
Perl interpreter in the final product (but see &quot;How can
I make my Perl program run faster?&quot;).</p>

interpreter. If you install another <br>
port, perhaps even building your own Win95/NT Perl from the
standard sources by using a Windows port of gcc (e.g., with
cygwin or mingw32), then you&rsquo;ll have to modify the
<br>
Registry yourself. In addition to associating
&quot;.pl&quot; with the interpreter, NT people can use:
&quot;SET PATHEXT=%PATHEXT%;.PL&quot; to let them run the

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Why don&rsquo;t Perl one-liners
work on my DOS/Mac/VMS system? <br>
The problem is usually that the command interpreters on
those systems have rather different ideas about quoting than
the Unix shells under which the one-liners were created. On
<br>
some systems, you may have to change single-quotes to double
ones, which you must NOT do on Unix or Plan9 systems. You
might also have to change a single % to a %%.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Unix (including Mac OS X) <br>
perl -e &rsquo;print &quot;Hello world0&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># DOS, etc. <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Mac Classic <br>
print &quot;Hello world0 <br>
(then Run &quot;Myscript&quot; or Shift-Command-R)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># MPW <br>
perl -e &rsquo;print &quot;Hello world0&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># VMS <br>
perl -e &quot;print &quot;&quot;Hello world0&quot;&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The problem is that none of
these examples are reliable: they depend on the command
interpreter. Under Unix, the first two often work. Under
DOS, it&rsquo;s entirely possible that <br>
neither works. If 4DOS was the command shell, you&rsquo;d
probably have better luck like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perl -e &quot;print
&lt;Ctrl-x&gt;&quot;Hello world0Ctrl-x&gt;&quot;&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Under the Mac, it depends which
environment you are using. The MacPerl shell, or MPW, is
much like Unix shells in its support for several quoting
variants, except that it makes <br>
free use of the Mac&rsquo;s non-ASCII characters as control
characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using qq(), q(), and qx(),
instead of &quot;double quotes&quot;, &rsquo;single
quotes&rsquo;, and &lsquo;backticks&lsquo;, may make
one-liners easier to write.</p>

the web, like &quot;Why do I get 500 Errors&quot; or

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Looking in to Plack and modern
Perl web frameworks is highly recommended, though; web
programming in Perl has evolved a long way from the old days
of simple CGI scripts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Where can I learn about
object-oriented Perl programming? <br>
A good place to start is perltoot, and you can use perlobj,
perlboot, perltoot, perltooc, and perlbot for reference.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A good book on OO on Perl is the
&quot;Object-Oriented Perl&quot; by Damian Conway from

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Where can I learn about linking
C with Perl? <br>
If you want to call C from Perl, start with perlxstut,
moving on to perlxs, xsubpp, and perlguts. If you want to
call Perl from C, then read perlembed, perlcall, and
perlguts. <br>
Don&rsquo;t forget that you can learn a lot from looking at
how the authors of existing extension modules wrote their
code and solved their problems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You might not need all the power
of XS. The Inline::C module lets you put C code directly in
your Perl source. It handles all the magic to make it work.
You still have to learn <br>
at least some of the perl API but you won&rsquo;t have to
deal with the complexity of the XS support files.</p>

perlguts, etc., but I can&rsquo;t embed perl in my C

again and again and again. If they fail, see perlbug and
send a bug report with <br>
the output of &quot;make test TEST_VERBOSE=1&quot; along
