<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This program is part of Netpbm(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ppmcie creates a PPM file
containing a plot of the CIE &rsquo;tongue&rsquo; color
chart -- to the extent possible in a PPM image.
Alternatively, creates a pseudo-PPM image of the color <br>
tongue using RGB values from a color system of your
choice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The CIE color tongue is an image
of all the hues that can be described by CIE X-Y
chromaticity coordinates. They are arranged on a two
dimensional coordinate plane with the X <br>
chromaticity on the horizontal axis and the Y chromaticity
on the vertical scale. (You can choose alternatively to use
CIE u&rsquo;-v&rsquo; chromaticity coordinates, but the
general idea <br>
of the color tongue is the same).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the PPM format
specifies that the RGB values in the file are from the ITU-R
Recommendation BT.709 color system, gamma-corrected. And
positive. See ppm(1) <br>
for details. If you use one of the color system options on
ppmcie, what you get is not a true PPM image, but is very
similar. If you display such ppmcie output using a device
<br>
that expects PPM input (which includes just about any
computer graphics display program), it will display the
wrong colors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, you may have a device
that expects one of these variations on PPM.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In every RGB color system you
can specify, including the default (which produces a true
PPM image) there are hues in the color tongue that
can&rsquo;t be represented. For example, <br>
monochromatic blue-green with a wavelength of 500nm cannot
be represented in a PPM image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For these hues, ppmcie
substitutes a similar hue as follows: They are desaturated
and rendered as the shade where the edge of the Maxwell
triangle intersects a line drawn from <br>
the requested shade to the white point defined by the color
system&rsquo;s white point. Furthermore, unless you specify
the -full option, ppmcie reduces their intensity by 25%
com&acirc; <br>
pared to the true hues in the image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ppmcie draws and labels the CIE
X-Y coordinate axes unless you choose otherwise with
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ppmcie draws the Maxwell
triangle for the color system in use on the color tongue.
The Maxwell triangle is the triangle whose vertices are the
primary illuminant hues for the <br>
color system. The hues inside the triangle show the color
gamut for the color system. They are also the only ones that
are correct for the CIE X-Y chromaticity coordinates <br>
shown. (See explanation above). ppmcie denotes the Maxwell
triangle by rendering it at full brightness, while rendering
the rest of the color tongue as 3/4 brightness. You can <br>
turn this off with options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ppmcie also places a black cross
at the color system&rsquo;s white point (with the center of
the cross open so you can actually see the white color) and
displays in text the CIE X-Y <br>
chromaticities of the primary illuminants and white point
for the color system. You can turn this off with options,
though.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ppmcie annotates the periphery
of the color tongue with the wavelength, in nanometers of
the monochromatic hues which appear there.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ppmcie displays the black body
chromaticity curve for Planckian radiators from 1000 to
30000 kelvins on the image. This curve traces the colors of
black bodies as various tem&acirc; <br>
peratures.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can choose from several
standard color systems, or specify one of your own
numerically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CIE charts, by their very
nature, contain a very large number of colors. If
you&rsquo;re encoding the chart for a color mapped device or
file format, you&rsquo;ll need to use pnmquant or <br>
ppmdither to reduce the number of colors in the image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
You may abbreviate any option to its shortest unique
prefix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-rec709</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-cie</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ebu</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-hdtv</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ntsc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-smpte Select a standard color
system whose gamut to plot. The default is -rec709, which
chooses ITU-R Recommendation BT.709, gamma-corrected. This
is the only color system for <br>
which ppmcie&rsquo;s output is a true PPM image. See
explanation above. -ebu chooses the primaries used in the
PAL and SECAM broadcasting standards. -ntsc chooses the
pri&acirc; <br>
maries specified by the NTSC broadcasting system (few modern
monitors actually cover this range). -smpte selects the
primaries recommended by the Society of Motion Pic&acirc;
<br>
ture and Television Engineers (SMPTE) in standards RP-37 and
RP-145, and -hdtv uses the much broader HDTV ideal
primaries. -cie chooses a color system that has the <br>
largest possible gamut within the spectrum of the chart.
This is the same color system as you get with the -cie
option to John Walker&rsquo;s cietoppm program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-xy plot CIE 1931 x y
chromaticities. This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-upvp plot u&rsquo; v&rsquo;
1976 chromaticities rather than CIE 1931 x y chromaticities.
The advantage of u&rsquo; v&rsquo; coordinates is that equal
intervals of distance on the u&rsquo; v&rsquo; plane
corre&acirc; <br>
spond roughly to the eye&rsquo;s ability to discriminate
colors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-red rx ry <br>
specifies the CIE x and y co-ordinates of the red illuminant
of a custom color system and selects the custom system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-green gx gy <br>
specifies the CIE x and y co-ordinates of the green
illuminant of the color system and selects the custom
system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-blue bx by <br>
specifies the CIE x and y co-ordinates of the blue
illuminant of the color system and selects the custom
system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-white wx wy <br>
specifies the CIE x and y co-ordinates of the white point of
the color system and selects the custom system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-size edge <br>
Create an image of edge by edge pixels. The default is
512x512.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-xsize|-width width <br>
Sets the width of the generated image to width pixels. The
default width is 512 pixels. If the height and width of the
image are not the same, the CIE diagram will be <br>
stretched in the longer dimension.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ysize|-height height <br>
Sets the height of the generated image to height pixels. The
default height is 512 pixels. If the height and width of the
image are not the same, the CIE diagram will be <br>
stretched in the longer dimension.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-noblack <br>
Don&rsquo;t plot the black body chromaticity curve.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nowpoint <br>
Don&rsquo;t plot the color system&rsquo;s white point.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nolabel <br>
Omit the label.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-noaxes <br>
Don&rsquo;t plot axes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-full Plot the entire CIE tongue
in full brightness; don&rsquo;t dim the part which is
outside the gamut of the specified color system (i.e.
outside the Maxwell triangle).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INTERPRETATION OF COLOR CHART
<br>
A color spectrum is a linear combination of one or more
monochromatic colors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A color is a set of color
spectra that all look the same to the human eye (and brain).
Actually, for the purposes of the definition, we assume the
eye has infinite precision, so <br>
we can call two color spectra different colors even though
they&rsquo;re so close a person couldn&rsquo;t possibly tell
them apart.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The eye contains 3 kinds of
color receptors (cones). Each has a different response to
the various monochromatic colors. One kind responds most
strongly to blue, another red, <br>
another green. Because there are only three, many different
color spectra will excite the cones at exactly the same
level, so the eye cannot tell them apart. All such spectra
<br>
that excite the cones in the same way are a single
color.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each point in the color tongue
represents a unique color. But there are an infinite number
of color spectra in the set that is that color; i.e. an
infinite number of color spec&acirc; <br>
tra that would look to you like this point. A machine could
tell them apart, but you could not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Remember that the colors outside
the highlighted triangle are approximations of the real
colors because the PPM format cannot represent them (and
your display device probably <br>
cannot display them). That is, unless you&rsquo;re using a
variation of PPM and a special display device, as discussed
earlier in this manual.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A color is always relative to
some given maximum brightness. A particular beam of light
looks lime green if in a dim field, but pea green if in a
bright field. An image on a <br>
movie screen may look pitch black because the projector is
not shining any light on it, but when you turn off the
projector and look at the same spot in room light, the
screen <br>
looks quite white. The same light from that spot hit your
eye with the project on as with it off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The chart shows two dimensions
of color. The third is intensity. All the colors in the
chart have the same intensity. To get all possible colors in
the gamut, Make copies of <br>
the whole chart at every intensity between zero and the
maximum.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The edge of the tongue consists
of all the monochromatic colors. A monochromatic color is
one with a single wavelength. I.e. a color that is in a
rainbow. The numbers you see <br>
are the wavelengths in nanometers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any straight line segment within
the tongue contains colors which are linear combinations of
two colors -- the colors at either end of the line
segment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any color in the chart can be
created from two other colors (actually, from any of an
infinite number of pairs of other colors).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All the colors within a triangle
inside the tongue can be created from a linear combination
of the colors at the vertices of that triangle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any color in the tongue can be
created from at most 3 monochromatic colors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The highlighted triangle shows
the colors that can be expressed in the tristimulus color
system you chose. (ITU-R BT.709 by default). The corners of
the triangle are the 3 pri&acirc; <br>
mary illuminants in that system (a certain red, green, and
blue for BT.709). The edges of the triangle, then, represent
the colors you can represent with two of the primary <br>
illuminants (saturated colors), and the interior colors
require all three primary illuminants (are not
saturated).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the ITU-R BT.709 color system
(the default), the white point is defined as D65, which is
(and is named after) the color of a black body at 6502
kelvins. Therefore, you should <br>
see the temperature curve on the image pass through the
white part of the image, and the cross that marks the white
point, at 6502 kelvins.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">D65 white is supposed to be the
color of the sun. If you have a perfect BT.709 display
device, you should see the color of the sun at the white
point cross. That&rsquo;s an important <br>
color, because when you look at an object in sunlight, the
color that reflects of the object is based on the color of
sunlight. Note that the sun produces a particular color <br>
spectrum, but many other color spectra are the same color,
and display devices never use the actual color spectrum of
the sun.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The colors at the corners of the
triangle have the chromaticities phosphors in a monitor that
uses the selected color system. Note that in BT.709 they are
very close to <br>
monochromatic red, green, and blue, but not quite.
That&rsquo;s why you can&rsquo;t display even one true color
of the rainbow on a video monitor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Remember that the chart shows
colors of constant intensity, therefore the corners of the
triangles are not the full colors of the primary
illuminants, but only their chromatici&acirc; <br>
ties. In fact, the illuminants typically have different
intensities. In BT.709, the blue primary illuminant is far
more intense than the green, which is more intense than the
<br>
red. Designers did this in order to make an equal
combination of red, green, and blue generate gray. I.e. a
combination of full strength red, full strength green, and
full <br>
strength blue BT.709 primary illuminants is D65 white.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The tongue has a sharp straight
edge at the bottom because that&rsquo;s the limit of human
vision. There are colors below that line, but they involve
infrared and ultraviolet light, <br>
so you can&rsquo;t see them. This line is called the
&rsquo;line of purples.&rsquo;</p>
