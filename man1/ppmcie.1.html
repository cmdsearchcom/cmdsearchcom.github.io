This program is part of <b>Netpbm</b>(1)
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>ppmcie</b> creates a PPM file containing a plot of the CIE 'tongue' color
  chart -- to the extent possible in a PPM image. Alternatively, creates a
  pseudo-PPM image of the color tongue using RGB values from a color system of
  your choice.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The CIE color tongue is an image of all the hues that can be described by CIE
  X-Y chromaticity coordinates. They are arranged on a two dimensional
  coordinate plane with the X chromaticity on the horizontal axis and the Y
  chromaticity on the vertical scale. (You can choose alternatively to use CIE
  u'-v' chromaticity coordinates, but the general idea of the color tongue is
  the same).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that the PPM format specifies that the RGB values in the file are from the
  ITU-R Recommendation BT.709 color system, gamma-corrected. And positive. See
  <b>ppm</b>(1)
<br/>
 for details. If you use one of the color system options on <b>ppmcie</b>, what
  you get is not a true PPM image, but is very similar. If you display such
  <b>ppmcie</b> output using a device that expects PPM input (which includes
  just about any computer graphics display program), it will display the wrong
  colors.
<div class="Pp"></div>
However, you may have a device that expects one of these variations on PPM.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In every RGB color system you can specify, including the default (which produces
  a true PPM image) there are hues in the color tongue that can't be
  represented. For example, monochromatic blue-green with a wavelength of 500nm
  cannot be represented in a PPM image.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For these hues, <b>ppmcie</b> substitutes a similar hue as follows: They are
  desaturated and rendered as the shade where the edge of the Maxwell triangle
  intersects a line drawn from the requested shade to the white point defined by
  the color system's white point. Furthermore, unless you specify the
  <b>-full</b> option, <b>ppmcie</b> reduces their intensity by 25% compared to
  the true hues in the image.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>ppmcie</b> draws and labels the CIE X-Y coordinate axes unless you choose
  otherwise with options.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>ppmcie</b> draws the Maxwell triangle for the color system in use on the
  color tongue. The Maxwell triangle is the triangle whose vertices are the
  primary illuminant hues for the color system. The hues inside the triangle
  show the color gamut for the color system. They are also the only ones that
  are correct for the CIE X-Y chromaticity coordinates shown. (See explanation
  above). <b>ppmcie</b> denotes the Maxwell triangle by rendering it at full
  brightness, while rendering the rest of the color tongue as 3/4 brightness.
  You can turn this off with options.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>ppmcie</b> also places a black cross at the color system's white point (with
  the center of the cross open so you can actually see the white color) and
  displays in text the CIE X-Y chromaticities of the primary illuminants and
  white point for the color system. You can turn this off with options, though.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>ppmcie</b> annotates the periphery of the color tongue with the wavelength,
  in nanometers of the monochromatic hues which appear there.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>ppmcie</b> displays the black body chromaticity curve for Planckian radiators
  from 1000 to 30000 kelvins on the image. This curve traces the colors of black
  bodies as various temperatures.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can choose from several standard color systems, or specify one of your own
  numerically.
<div class="Pp"></div>
CIE charts, by their very nature, contain a very large number of colors. If
  you're encoding the chart for a color mapped device or file format, you'll
  need to use <b>pnmquant</b> or <b>ppmdither</b> to reduce the number of colors
  in the image.

  OF COLOR CHART</a></h1>
A color spectrum is a linear combination of one or more monochromatic colors.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A color is a set of color spectra that all look the same to the human eye (and
  brain). Actually, for the purposes of the definition, we assume the eye has
  infinite precision, so we can call two color spectra different colors even
  though they're so close a person couldn't possibly tell them apart.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The eye contains 3 kinds of color receptors (cones). Each has a different
  response to the various monochromatic colors. One kind responds most strongly
  to blue, another red, another green. Because there are only three, many
  different color spectra will excite the cones at exactly the same level, so
  the eye cannot tell them apart. All such spectra that excite the cones in the
  same way are a single color.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Each point in the color tongue represents a unique color. But there are an
  infinite number of color spectra in the set that is that color; i.e. an
  infinite number of color spectra that would look to you like this point. A
  machine could tell them apart, but you could not.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Remember that the colors outside the highlighted triangle are approximations of
  the real colors because the PPM format cannot represent them (and your display
  device probably cannot display them). That is, unless you're using a variation
  of PPM and a special display device, as discussed earlier in this manual.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A color is always relative to some given maximum brightness. A particular beam
  of light looks lime green if in a dim field, but pea green if in a bright
  field. An image on a movie screen may look pitch black because the projector
  is not shining any light on it, but when you turn off the projector and look
  at the same spot in room light, the screen looks quite white. The same light
  from that spot hit your eye with the project on as with it off.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The chart shows two dimensions of color. The third is intensity. All the colors
  in the chart have the same intensity. To get all possible colors in the gamut,
  Make copies of the whole chart at every intensity between zero and the
  maximum.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The edge of the tongue consists of all the monochromatic colors. A monochromatic
  color is one with a single wavelength. I.e. a color that is in a rainbow. The
  numbers you see are the wavelengths in nanometers.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Any straight line segment within the tongue contains colors which are linear
  combinations of two colors -- the colors at either end of the line segment.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Any color in the chart can be created from two other colors (actually, from any
  of an infinite number of pairs of other colors).
<div class="Pp"></div>
All the colors within a triangle inside the tongue can be created from a linear
  combination of the colors at the vertices of that triangle.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Any color in the tongue can be created from at most 3 monochromatic colors.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The highlighted triangle shows the colors that can be expressed in the
  tristimulus color system you chose. (ITU-R BT.709 by default). The corners of
  the triangle are the 3 primary illuminants in that system (a certain red,
  green, and blue for BT.709). The edges of the triangle, then, represent the
  colors you can represent with two of the primary illuminants (saturated
  colors), and the interior colors require all three primary illuminants (are
  not saturated).
<div class="Pp"></div>
In the ITU-R BT.709 color system (the default), the white point is defined as
  D65, which is (and is named after) the color of a black body at 6502 kelvins.
  Therefore, you should see the temperature curve on the image pass through the
  white part of the image, and the cross that marks the white point, at 6502
  kelvins.
<div class="Pp"></div>
D65 white is supposed to be the color of the sun. If you have a perfect BT.709
  display device, you should see the color of the sun at the white point cross.
  That's an important color, because when you look at an object in sunlight, the
  color that reflects of the object is based on the color of sunlight. Note that
  the sun produces a particular color spectrum, but many other color spectra are
  the same color, and display devices never use the actual color spectrum of the
  sun.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The colors at the corners of the triangle have the chromaticities phosphors in a
  monitor that uses the selected color system. Note that in BT.709 they are very
  close to monochromatic red, green, and blue, but not quite. That's why you
  can't display even one true color of the rainbow on a video monitor.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Remember that the chart shows colors of constant intensity, therefore the
  corners of the triangles are not the full colors of the primary illuminants,
  but only their chromaticities. In fact, the illuminants typically have
  different intensities. In BT.709, the blue primary illuminant is far more
  intense than the green, which is more intense than the red. Designers did this
  in order to make an equal combination of red, green, and blue generate gray.
  I.e. a combination of full strength red, full strength green, and full
  strength blue BT.709 primary illuminants is D65 white.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The tongue has a sharp straight edge at the bottom because that's the limit of
  human vision. There are colors below that line, but they involve infrared and
  ultraviolet light, so you can't see them. This line is called the 'line of
  purples.'
