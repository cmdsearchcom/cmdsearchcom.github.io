<p>THINKFAN(1) thinkfan THINKFAN(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
thinkfan - A simple fan control program</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
thinkfan [-hnqzDd] [-b BIAS] [-c CONFIG] [-s SECONDS] [-p
[DELAY]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Thinkfan sets the fan speed according to temperature limits
preconfigured in /etc/thinkfan.conf. It can read
temperatures from three possible sources:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/proc/acpi/ibm/thermal <br>
Which is provided by the thinkpad_acpi kernel module,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/sys/class/hwmon/*/temp*_input
<br>
Which may be provided by any hwmon drivers, and</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">S.M.A.R.T. (since 0.9) <br>
Which reads the temperature directly from the hard disk
using libatasmart.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that since 0.9 you can use
any sensors of these three types at the same time. To allow
that, the configuration keywords have been changed. The
sensor keyword has been depre&acirc; <br>
cated in favor of the new keywords tp_thermal, hwmon and
atasmart which mark the following path as a legacy
thinkpad_acpi thermal file, sysfs hwmon file, or a hard disk
device <br>
file, respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The fan can be
/proc/acpi/ibm/fan or some PWM file in /sys/class/hwmon.
Note that the fan config keyword is deprecated as well.
Instead, you should use tp_fan for a legacy <br>
thinkpad_acpi fan file or pwm_fan for a sysfs PWM file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See the README file and the
example configurations for details on these changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WARNING: This program does only
very basic sanity checking on the configuration. That means
that you can set your temperature limits as insane as you
like.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are two general modes of
operation:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMPLEX MODE <br>
In complex mode, temperature limits are defined for each
sensor thinkfan knows about. Setting suitable limits for
each sensor in your system will probably require a bit of
exper&acirc; <br>
imentation and good knowledge about your hardware, but
it&rsquo;s the safest way of keeping each component within
its specified temperature range. See <br>
http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Thermal_Sensors for details on
which sensor measures what temperature in a Thinkpad. On
other systems you&rsquo;ll have to find out on your own. See
the <br>
example configs to learn about the syntax.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIMPLE MODE <br>
In simple mode, Thinkfan uses only the highest temperature
found in the system. That may be dangerous, e.g. for hard
disks. That&rsquo;s why you should provide a correction
value <br>
(i.e. add 10-15 &deg;C) for the sensor that has the
temperature of your hard disk (or battery...). See the
example config files for details about that.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION <br>
Some example configurations are provided with the source
package. For detailed explanations please read the README
file. If you installed thinkfan from a distribution package,
<br>
you may find them under /usr/share/doc or wherever your
package manager puts documentation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-h Show a short help message</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s SECONDS <br>
Maximum seconds between temperature updates (default: 5)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b BIAS <br>
Floating point number (-10 to 30) to control rising
temperature exaggeration. If the temperature increases by
more than 2 &Acirc;&deg;C during one cycle, this number is
used to cal&acirc; <br>
culate a bias, which is added to the current highest
temperature seen in the system:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">current_tmax = current_tmax +
delta_t * BIAS / 10</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This means that negative numbers
can be used to even out short and sudden temperature spikes
like those seen on some on-DIE sensors. Use DANGEROUS mode
to remove the -10 <br>
to +30 limit. Note that you can&rsquo;t have a space between
-b and a negative argument, because otherwise getopt will
interpret things like -10 as an option and fail (i.e. <br>
write &quot;-b-10&quot; instead of &quot;-b -10&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default is 15.0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c FILE <br>
Load a different configuration file (default:
/etc/thinkfan.conf)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Do not become a daemon and
log to terminal instead of syslog</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Be quiet (no status info on
terminal)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z Assume we don&rsquo;t have to
worry about resuming from standby when using the sysfs
interface (see README!)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p [SECONDS] <br>
Use the pulsing-fan workaround (for older Thinkpads). Takes
an optional floating-point argument (0-10s) as depulsing
duration. Default 0.5s.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Do not read temperature from
sleeping disks. Instead, 0 &Acirc;&deg;C is used as that
disk&rsquo;s temperature. This is needed if reading the
temperature causes your disk to wake up unnec&acirc; <br>
essarily. Note: This option is only available if thinkfan
was built with -D USE_ATASMART.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D DANGEROUS mode: Disable all
sanity checks. May damage your hardware!!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGNALS <br>
SIGINT and SIGTERM simply interrupt operation and should
cause thinkfan to terminate cleanly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGHUP makes thinkfan reload its
config. If there&rsquo;s any problem with the new config, we
keep the old one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGUSR1 causes thinkfan to dump
all currently known temperatures either to syslog, or to the
console (if running with the -n option).</p>
