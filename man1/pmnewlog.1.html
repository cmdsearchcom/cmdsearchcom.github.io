<p>PMNEWLOG(1) General Commands Manual PMNEWLOG(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pmnewlog - stop and restart archive logging for PCP
performance metrics</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
$PCP_BINADM_DIR/pmnewlog [-a accessfile] [-C saveconfig] [-c
configfile] [-N] [-n pmnsfile] [-P] [-p pid] [-s] [-V]
[other pmlogger options] archive</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
pmnewlog may be used to stop and restart a running instance
of pmlogger(1). This is most useful for managing multiple
sets of Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) archive logs. These
ar&acirc; <br>
chive logs record the history of performance metric values
that may be &lsquo;&lsquo;played back&rsquo;&rsquo; by other
PCP tools, and they form the basis of the VCR paradigm and
retrospective perfor&acirc; <br>
mance analysis services common to the PCP toolkit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In normal usage, pmnewlog would
be executed by cron(1) in the wee hours to terminate one PCP
archive log and start another, i.e. to perform log
rotation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Even more common, would be the
execution of pmnewlog from the PCP archive management script
pmlogger_daily(1). In this case, direct end-user execution
of pmnewlog is most <br>
unlikely.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The mandatory argument archive
is the base name for the physical files that will constitute
the new archive log.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The pmlogger instance to be
stopped and restarted must be running on the same system as
pmnewlog and is either the primary logger (the default) or
the logger with pid as speci&acirc; <br>
fied by the -p option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -n option is specified,
then pmnewlog will use the namespace in the pmnsfile, rather
than the default Performance Metrics Name Space (PMNS).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no -c option is specified,
pmnewlog will use pmlc(1) to connect to the running
pmlogger(1) and so determine all those metrics and instances
that are subject to mandatory log&acirc; <br>
ging or advisory on logging, and the associated logging
frequencies. This information is used to synthesize a new
pmlogger(1) configuration file. If the -n option is
specified, <br>
it will also be used for these interactions with
pmlc(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -c option is specified,
pmlogger(1) will be restarted with configfile as the
configuration file. Normally configfile would be the same
configuration file used to start <br>
pmlogger(1) in the first place, however note that since
pmlogger(1) is restarted, any changes to the logging status
made using pmlc(1) will be lost, unless these have also been
<br>
reflected in changes to configfile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If configfile does not exist,
then a search is made in the directory
$PCP_VAR_DIR/config/pmlogger for a file of the same name,
and if found that file is used, e.g. if config.mum&acirc;
<br>
ble does not exist in the current directory and the file
$PCP_VAR_DIR/config/pmlogger/config.mumble does exist, then
-c config.mumble and -c
$PCP_VAR_DIR/config/pmlogger/con&acirc; <br>
fig.mumble are equivalent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Access controls specifications
for the new pmlogger(1) instance may optionally be provided
via the -a option. The contents of accessfile should start
with the literal token <br>
[access] and conform to the syntax of the access controls
section as described for pmlogger(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -C option may be used to
save the configuration file that pmnewlog passes to the
newly launched pmlogger(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the pmlogger(1) instance
needs to be started under the control of pmsocks(1) to
connect to a pmcd through a firewall, the -s option may be
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -V option enables verbose
reporting of the activity. By default no output is generated
unless some error or warning condition is encountered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -N option enables a
&lsquo;&lsquo;show me&rsquo;&rsquo; mode, where the actions
are echoed, but not executed, in the style of
&lsquo;&lsquo;make -n&rsquo;&rsquo;. Using -N in conjunction
with -V maximizes the diagnostic <br>
capabilities for debugging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The other pmlogger options are
as described for pmlogger(1). Note that pmnewlog does not
support the following options of pmlogger(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h host <br>
pmnewlog determines the host to which the new pmlogger(1)
should connect based upon the current host connection for
the old pmlogger(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s samples <br>
The new pmlogger(1) is expected to be long running, and the
-s option of pmnewlog takes precedence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T runtime <br>
The new pmlogger(1) is expected to be long running</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V version <br>
The new pmlogger will always create the latest version PCP
archive format, and the -V option of pmnewlog takes
precedence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x fd The launched pmlogger
cannot be controlled by pmRecordControl(3).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLE <br>
The following sh(1) script could be executed by root via
cron(1) to start a new set of archive logs for the primary
logger each evening. A more complete version of this script
<br>
may be found in $PCP_BINADM_DIR/pmlogger_daily, and is
documented in the manual page for pmlogger_daily(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#!/bin/sh <br>
# start new logs for PCP primary logger on this host</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># standard place for logs <br>
LOGDIR=$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmlogger/&lsquo;hostname&lsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># each new log is named
yymmdd.hh.mm <br>
LOGNAME=&lsquo;date &quot;+%Y%m%d.%H.%M&quot;&lsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># do it <br>
[ ! -d $LOGDIR ] &amp;&amp; mkdir -p $LOGDIR <br>
cd $LOGDIR <br>
$PCP_BINADM_DIR/pmnewlog -l $LOGDIR/pmlogger.log $LOGDIR</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
archive.meta <br>
metadata (metric descriptions, instance domains, etc.) for
the archive log <br>
archive.0 initial volume of metrics values (subsequent
volumes have suffixes 1, 2, ...) <br>
archive.index <br>
temporal index to support rapid random access to the other
files in the archive log <br>
$PCP_BINADM_DIR/pmlogger_daily <br>
sample script to rotate archives for a number of loggers</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PCP ENVIRONMENT <br>
Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP. On
each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local
<br>
values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF variable may be
used to specify an alternative configuration file, as
described in pcp.conf(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
PCPIntro(1), pmcd(1), pmdumplog(1), pmlc(1), pmlogger(1),
pmlogger_daily(1), pmsocks(1), pcp.conf(5) and
pcp.env(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
Due to the precious nature of the archive logs, pmnewlog is
rather paranoid in its checking and validation, and will try
very hard to ensure that an appropriately configured <br>
pmlogger(1) can be restarted, before terminating the
existing pmlogger(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As a consequence of this
checking, pmnewlog tends to generate rather verbose error
and warning messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CAVEATS <br>
If no configfile is specified, the method for synthesizing a
configuration file using a pmlc(1) connection to the
existing pmlogger(1) is, of necessity, incomplete. In
particu&acirc; <br>
lar, for metrics with dynamic underlying instance domains,
it is not possible to identify a configuration that logs all
instances of a metric all of the time, so rather the
syn&acirc; <br>
thesized configuration file requests the continued logging
of the set of instances that exist at the time pmlogger(1)
is interrogated by pmnewlog.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this situation is a concern,
a fixed configuration file should be used, and passed to
pmnewlog via the -c option.</p>
