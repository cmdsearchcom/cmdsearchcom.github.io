<p>GIT-RESET(1) Git Manual GIT-RESET(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
git-reset - Reset current HEAD to the specified state</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
git reset [-q] [&lt;tree-ish&gt;] [--] &lt;paths&gt;... <br>
git reset (--patch | -p) [&lt;tree-sh&gt;] [--]
[&lt;paths&gt;...] <br>
git reset [--soft | --mixed | --hard | --merge | --keep]
[-q] [&lt;commit&gt;]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
In the first and second form, copy entries from
&lt;tree-ish&gt; to the index. In the third form, set the
current branch head (HEAD) to &lt;commit&gt;, optionally
modifying index and working <br>
tree to match. The &lt;tree-ish&gt;/&lt;commit&gt; defaults
to HEAD in all forms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">git reset [-q]
[&lt;tree-ish&gt;] [--] &lt;paths&gt;... <br>
This form resets the index entries for all &lt;paths&gt; to
their state at &lt;tree-ish&gt;. (It does not affect the
working tree, nor the current branch.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This means that git reset
&lt;paths&gt; is the opposite of git add &lt;paths&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After running git reset
&lt;paths&gt; to update the index entry, you can use
git-checkout(1) to check the contents out of the index to
the working tree. Alternatively, using git- <br>
checkout(1) and specifying a commit, you can copy the
contents of a path out of a commit to the index and to the
working tree in one go.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">git reset (--patch | -p)
[&lt;tree-ish&gt;] [--] [&lt;paths&gt;...] <br>
Interactively select hunks in the difference between the
index and &lt;tree-ish&gt; (defaults to HEAD). The chosen
hunks are applied in reverse to the index.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This means that git reset -p is
the opposite of git add -p, i.e. you can use it to
selectively reset hunks. See the &acirc;Interactive
Mode&acirc; section of git-add(1) to learn how to <br>
operate the --patch mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">git reset [&lt;mode&gt;]
[&lt;commit&gt;] <br>
This form resets the current branch head to &lt;commit&gt;
and possibly updates the index (resetting it to the tree of
&lt;commit&gt;) and the working tree depending on
&lt;mode&gt;. If &lt;mode&gt; <br>
is omitted, defaults to &quot;--mixed&quot;. The
&lt;mode&gt; must be one of the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--soft <br>
Does not touch the index file nor the working tree at all
(but resets the head to &lt;commit&gt;, just like all modes
do). This leaves all your changed files &quot;Changes to be
<br>
committed&quot;, as git status would put it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--mixed <br>
Resets the index but not the working tree (i.e., the changed
files are preserved but not marked for commit) and reports
what has not been updated. This is the default <br>
action.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--hard <br>
Resets the index and working tree. Any changes to tracked
files in the working tree since &lt;commit&gt; are
discarded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--merge <br>
Resets the index and updates the files in the working tree
that are different between &lt;commit&gt; and HEAD, but
keeps those which are different between the index and
working <br>
tree (i.e. which have changes which have not been added). If
a file that is different between &lt;commit&gt; and the
index has unstaged changes, reset is aborted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In other words, --merge does
something like a git read-tree -u -m &lt;commit&gt;, but
carries forward unmerged index entries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--keep <br>
Resets index entries and updates files in the working tree
that are different between &lt;commit&gt; and HEAD. If a
file that is different between &lt;commit&gt; and HEAD has
local <br>
changes, reset is aborted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to undo a commit
other than the latest on a branch, git-revert(1) is your
friend.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-q, --quiet <br>
Be quiet, only report errors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Undo add</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ edit (1) <br>
$ git add frotz.c filfre.c <br>
$ mailx (2) <br>
$ git reset (3) <br>
$ git pull git://info.example.com/ nitfol (4)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. You are happily working on
something, and find the changes in these files are in good
order. You do not want to see them when you run &quot;git
diff&quot;, because you plan to work <br>
on other files and changes with these files are distracting.
<br>
2. Somebody asks you to pull, and the changes sounds worthy
of merging. <br>
3. However, you already dirtied the index (i.e. your index
does not match the HEAD commit). But you know the pull you
are going to make does not affect frotz.c nor filfre.c, <br>
so you revert the index changes for these two files. Your
changes in working tree remain there. <br>
4. Then you can pull and merge, leaving frotz.c and filfre.c
changes still in the working tree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Undo a commit and redo</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git commit ... <br>
$ git reset --soft HEAD^ (1) <br>
$ edit (2) <br>
$ git commit -a -c ORIG_HEAD (3)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. This is most often done when
you remembered what you just committed is incomplete, or you
misspelled your commit message, or both. Leaves working tree
as it was before <br>
&quot;reset&quot;. <br>
2. Make corrections to working tree files. <br>
3. &quot;reset&quot; copies the old head to .git/ORIG_HEAD;
redo the commit by starting with its log message. If you do
not need to edit the message further, you can give -C option
<br>
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See also the --amend option to
git-commit(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Undo a commit, making it a topic
branch</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git branch topic/wip (1) <br>
$ git reset --hard HEAD~3 (2) <br>
$ git checkout topic/wip (3)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. You have made some commits,
but realize they were premature to be in the
&quot;master&quot; branch. You want to continue polishing
them in a topic branch, so create &quot;topic/wip&quot; <br>
branch off of the current HEAD. <br>
2. Rewind the master branch to get rid of those three
commits. <br>
3. Switch to &quot;topic/wip&quot; branch and keep
working.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Undo commits permanently</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git commit ... <br>
$ git reset --hard HEAD~3 (1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. The last three commits (HEAD,
HEAD^, and HEAD~2) were bad and you do not want to ever see
them again. Do not do this if you have already given these
commits to somebody <br>
else. (See the &quot;RECOVERING FROM UPSTREAM REBASE&quot;
section in git-rebase(1) for the implications of doing
so.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Undo a merge or pull</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git pull (1) <br>
Auto-merging nitfol <br>
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in nitfol <br>
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the
result. <br>
$ git reset --hard (2) <br>
$ git pull . topic/branch (3) <br>
Updating from 41223... to 13134... <br>
Fast-forward <br>
$ git reset --hard ORIG_HEAD (4)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. Try to update from the
upstream resulted in a lot of conflicts; you were not ready
to spend a lot of time merging right now, so you decide to
do that later. <br>
2. &quot;pull&quot; has not made merge commit, so &quot;git
reset --hard&quot; which is a synonym for &quot;git reset
--hard HEAD&quot; clears the mess from the index file and
the working tree. <br>
3. Merge a topic branch into the current branch, which
resulted in a fast-forward. <br>
4. But you decided that the topic branch is not ready for
public consumption yet. &quot;pull&quot; or
&quot;merge&quot; always leaves the original tip of the
current branch in ORIG_HEAD, so <br>
resetting hard to it brings your index file and the working
tree back to that state, and resets the tip of the branch to
that commit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Undo a merge or pull inside a
dirty working tree</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git pull (1) <br>
Auto-merging nitfol <br>
Merge made by recursive. <br>
nitfol | 20 +++++---- <br>
... <br>
$ git reset --merge ORIG_HEAD (2)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. Even if you may have local
modifications in your working tree, you can safely say
&quot;git pull&quot; when you know that the change in the
other branch does not overlap with them. <br>
2. After inspecting the result of the merge, you may find
that the change in the other branch is unsatisfactory.
Running &quot;git reset --hard ORIG_HEAD&quot; will let you
go back to <br>
where you were, but it will discard your local changes,
which you do not want. &quot;git reset --merge&quot; keeps
your local changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Interrupted workflow <br>
Suppose you are interrupted by an urgent fix request while
you are in the middle of a large change. The files in your
working tree are not in any shape to be committed yet, <br>
but you need to get to the other branch for a quick
bugfix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git checkout feature ;# you
were working in &quot;feature&quot; branch and <br>
$ work work work ;# got interrupted <br>
$ git commit -a -m &quot;snapshot WIP&quot; (1) <br>
$ git checkout master <br>
$ fix fix fix <br>
$ git commit ;# commit with real log <br>
$ git checkout feature <br>
$ git reset --soft HEAD^ ;# go back to WIP state (2) <br>
$ git reset (3)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. This commit will get blown
away so a throw-away log message is OK. <br>
2. This removes the WIP commit from the commit history, and
sets your working tree to the state just before you made
that snapshot. <br>
3. At this point the index file still has all the WIP
changes you committed as snapshot WIP. This updates the
index to show your WIP files as uncommitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See also git-stash(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Reset a single file in the index
<br>
Suppose you have added a file to your index, but later
decide you do not want to add it to your commit. You can
remove the file from the index while keeping your changes
with <br>
git reset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git reset -- frotz.c (1) <br>
$ git commit -m &quot;Commit files in index&quot; (2) <br>
$ git add frotz.c (3)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. This removes the file from
the index while keeping it in the working directory. <br>
2. This commits all other changes in the index. <br>
3. Adds the file to the index again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Keep changes in working tree
while discarding some previous commits <br>
Suppose you are working on something and you commit it, and
then you continue working a bit more, but now you think that
what you have in your working tree should be in <br>
another branch that has nothing to do with what you
committed previously. You can start a new branch and reset
it while keeping the changes in your working tree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git tag start <br>
$ git checkout -b branch1 <br>
$ edit <br>
$ git commit ... (1) <br>
$ edit <br>
$ git checkout -b branch2 (2) <br>
$ git reset --keep start (3)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. This commits your first edits
in branch1. <br>
2. In the ideal world, you could have realized that the
earlier commit did not belong to the new topic when you
created and switched to branch2 (i.e. &quot;git checkout -b
branch2 <br>
start&quot;), but nobody is perfect. <br>
3. But you can use &quot;reset --keep&quot; to remove the
unwanted commit after you switched to
&quot;branch2&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DISCUSSION <br>
The tables below show what happens when running:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">git reset --option target</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">to reset the HEAD to another
commit (target) with the different reset options depending
on the state of the files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In these tables, A, B, C and D
are some different states of a file. For example, the first
line of the first table means that if a file is in state A
in the working tree, in <br>
state B in the index, in state C in HEAD and in state D in
the target, then &quot;git reset --soft target&quot; will
leave the file in the working tree in state A and in the
index in state <br>
B. It resets (i.e. moves) the HEAD (i.e. the tip of the
current branch, if you are on one) to &quot;target&quot;
(which has the file in state D).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">working index HEAD target

--merge B C C <br>
--keep B C C</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;reset --merge&quot; is
meant to be used when resetting out of a conflicted merge.
Any mergy operation guarantees that the working tree file
that is involved in the merge does not <br>
have local change wrt the index before it starts, and that
it writes the result out to the working tree. So if we see
some difference between the index and the target and also
<br>
between the index and the working tree, then it means that
we are not resetting out from a state that a mergy operation
left after failing with a conflict. That is why we <br>
disallow --merge option in this case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;reset --keep&quot; is
meant to be used when removing some of the last commits in
the current branch while keeping changes in the working
tree. If there could be conflicts between the <br>
changes in the commit we want to remove and the changes in
the working tree we want to keep, the reset is disallowed.
That&acirc;s why it is disallowed if there are both changes
<br>
between the working tree and HEAD, and between HEAD and the
target. To be safe, it is also disallowed when there are
unmerged entries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following tables show what
happens when there are unmerged entries:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">working index HEAD target
working index HEAD <br>
---------------------------------------------------- <br>
X U A B --soft (disallowed) <br>
--mixed X B B <br>
--hard B B B <br>
--merge B B B <br>
--keep (disallowed)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">working index HEAD target

---------------------------------------------------- <br>
X U A A --soft (disallowed) <br>
--mixed X A A <br>
--hard A A A <br>
--merge A A A <br>
--keep (disallowed)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">X means any state and U means an
unmerged index.</p>
