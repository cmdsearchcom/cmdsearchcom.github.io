<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This program builds a VRT (Virtual Dataset) that is a mosaic
of the list of input GDAL datasets. The list of input GDAL
datasets can be specified at the end of the command line,
<br>
or put in a text file (one filename per line) for very long
lists, or it can be a MapServer tileindex (see gdaltindex
utility). In the later case, all entries in the tile index
<br>
will be added to the VRT.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With -separate, each files goes
into a separate band in the VRT band. Otherwise, the files
are considered as tiles of a larger mosaic and the VRT file
has as many bands as one of <br>
the input files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If one GDAL dataset is made of
several subdatasets and has 0 raster bands, all the
subdatasets will be added to the VRT rather than the dataset
itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gdalbuildvrt does some amount of
checks to assure that all files that will be put in the
resulting VRT have similar characteristics : number of
bands, projection, color <br>
interpretation... If not, files that do not match the common
characteristics will be skipped. (This is only true in the
default mode, and not when using the -separate option)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If there is some amount of
spatial overlapping between files, the order of files
appearing in the list of source matter: files that are
listed at the end are the ones from which <br>
the content will be fetched. Note that nodata will be taken
into account to potentially fetch data from less prioritary
datasets, but currently, alpha channel is not taken into
<br>
account to do alpha compositing (so a source with alpha=0
appearing on top of another source will override is
content). This might be changed in later versions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This utility is somehow
equivalent to the gdal_vrtmerge.py utility and is build by
default in GDAL 1.6.1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-tileindex: <br>
Use the specified value as the tile index field, instead of
the default value with is &rsquo;location&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-resolution
{highest|lowest|average|user}: <br>
In case the resolution of all input files is not the same,
the -resolution flag enables the user to control the way the
output resolution is computed. &rsquo;average&rsquo; is the
<br>
default. &rsquo;highest&rsquo; will pick the smallest values
of pixel dimensions within the set of source rasters.
&rsquo;lowest&rsquo; will pick the largest values of pixel
dimensions within the <br>
set of source rasters. &rsquo;average&rsquo; will compute an
average of pixel dimensions within the set of source
rasters. &rsquo;user&rsquo; is new in GDAL 1.7.0 and must be
used in combination <br>
with the -tr option to specify the target resolution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-tr xres yres : <br>
(starting with GDAL 1.7.0) set target resolution. The values
must be expressed in georeferenced units. Both must be
positive values. Specifying those values is of course <br>
incompatible with highest|lowest|average values for
-resolution option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-tap: <br>
(GDAL &gt;= 1.8.0) (target aligned pixels) align the
coordinates of the extent of the output file to the values
of the -tr, such that the aligned extent includes the
minimum <br>
extent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-te xmin ymin xmax ymax : <br>
(starting with GDAL 1.7.0) set georeferenced extents of VRT
file. The values must be expressed in georeferenced units.
If not specified, the extent of the VRT is the minimum <br>
bounding box of the set of source rasters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-addalpha: <br>
(starting with GDAL 1.7.0) Adds an alpha mask band to the
VRT when the source raster have none. Mainly useful for RGB
sources (or grey-level sources). The alpha band is <br>
filled on-the-fly with the value 0 in areas without any
source raster, and with value 255 in areas with source
raster. The effect is that a RGBA viewer will render the
areas <br>
without source rasters as transparent and areas with source
rasters as opaque. This option is not compatible with
-separate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-hidenodata: <br>
(starting with GDAL 1.7.0) Even if any band contains nodata
value, giving this option makes the VRT band not report the
NoData. Useful when you want to control the background <br>
color of the dataset. By using along with the -addalpha
option, you can prepare a dataset which doesn&rsquo;t report
nodata value but is transparent in areas with no data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-srcnodata value [value...]:
<br>
(starting with GDAL 1.7.0) Set nodata values for input bands
(different values can be supplied for each band). If more
than one value is supplied all values should be quoted <br>
to keep them together as a single operating system argument.
If the option is not specified, the intrinsic nodata
settings on the source datasets will be used (if they <br>
exist). The value set by this option is written in the
NODATA element of each ComplexSource element. Use a value of
None to ignore intrinsic nodata settings on the source <br>
datasets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b band: <br>
(GDAL &gt;= 1.10.0) Select an input band to be processed.
Bands are numbered from 1. If input bands not set all bands
will be added to vrt. Multiple -b switches may be used to
<br>
select a set of input bands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sd subdataset <br>
(GDAL &gt;= 1.10.0) If the input dataset contains several
subdatasets use a subdataset with the specified number
(starting from 1). This is an alternative of giving the full
<br>
subdataset name as an input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-vrtnodata value [value...]:
<br>
(starting with GDAL 1.7.0) Set nodata values at the VRT band
level (different values can be supplied for each band). If
more than one value is supplied all values should be <br>
quoted to keep them together as a single operating system
argument. If the option is not specified, intrinsic nodata
settings on the first dataset will be used (if they <br>
exist). The value set by this option is written in the
NoDataValue element of each VRTRasterBand element. Use a
value of None to ignore intrinsic nodata settings on the
<br>
source datasets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-separate: <br>
(starting with GDAL 1.7.0) Place each input file into a
separate band. In that case, only the first band of each
dataset will be placed into a new band. Contrary to the <br>
default mode, it is not required that all bands have the
same datatype.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-allow_projection_difference:
<br>
(starting with GDAL 1.7.0) When this option is specified,
the utility will accept to make a VRT even if the input
datasets have not the same projection. Note: this does not
<br>
mean that they will be reprojected. Their projection will
just be ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a_srs srs_def: <br>
(starting with GDAL 1.10) Override the projection for the
output file. The srs_def may be any of the usual GDAL/OGR
forms, complete WKT, PROJ.4, EPSG:n or a file containing
<br>
the WKT.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r {nearest
(default),bilinear,cubic,cubicspline,lanczos,average,mode}:
<br>
(GDAL &gt;= 2.0) Select a resampling algorithm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-input_file_list: <br>
To specify a text file with an input filename on each
line</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q: <br>
(starting with GDAL 1.7.0) To disable the progress bar on
the console</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-overwrite: <br>
Overwrite the VRT if it already exists.</p>
