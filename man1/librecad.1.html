LIBRECAD - A professional CAD System.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
LibreCAD is a professional CAD System. With LibreCAD you can easily construct
  and change drawings with ISO-texts and many other features and save them as
  DXF-files. These DXF-files are the interface to many CAD-systems such as
  AutoCAD(R) and many others.

LibreCAD has no special invocation parameters.

We are very sorry but could not include the manual because of License issues
  with the manual from the original QCad CE edition. However, we are working to
  create a new manual specially for LibreCAD.
