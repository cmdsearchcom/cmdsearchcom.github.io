This program is part of <b>Netpbm</b>(1)
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>pnmnlfilt</b> produces an output image where the pixels are a summary of
  multiple pixels near the corresponding location in an input image.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This program works on multi-image streams.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This is something of a swiss army knife filter. It has 3 distinct operating
  modes. In all of the modes <b>pnmnlfilt</b> examines each pixel in the image
  and processes it according to the values of it and its surrounding pixels.
  Rather than using a square block of surrounding pixels (e.g. the subject pixel
  and its 8 immediate neighbors, in a 3x3 square), <b>pnmnlfilt</b> uses 7
  hexagonal areas. You choose the size of the hexagons with the radius
  parameter. A radius value of 1/3 means that the 7 hexagons essentially fit
  into the subject pixel (ie. there will be no filtering effect). A radius value
  of 1.0 means that the 7 hexagons essentially cover the 3x3 immediate neighbor
  square.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Your choice of 'alpha' parameter selects among the three modes.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Alpha_trimmed_mean_filter_(0.0_&lt;=_alpha_&lt;=_0.5)"><a class="selflink" href="#Alpha_trimmed_mean_filter_(0.0_&lt;=_alpha_&lt;=_0.5)">Alpha
  trimmed mean filter (0.0 &lt;= alpha &lt;= 0.5)</a></h2>
The value of the center pixel will be replaced by the mean of the 7 hexagon
  values, but the 7 values are sorted by size and the top and bottom alpha
  portion of the 7 are excluded from the mean. This implies that an alpha value
  of 0.0 gives the same sort of output as a normal convolution (ie. averaging or
  smoothing filter), where radius will determine the 'strength' of the filter. A
  good value to start from for subtle filtering is alpha = 0.0, radius = 0.55
  For a more blatant effect, try alpha 0.0 and radius 1.0
<div class="Pp"></div>
An alpha value of 0.5 will cause the median value of the 7 hexagons to be used
  to replace the center pixel value. This sort of filter is good for eliminating
  'pop' or single pixel noise from an image without spreading the noise out or
  smudging features on the image. Judicious use of the radius parameter will
  fine tune the filtering. Intermediate values of alpha give effects somewhere
  between smoothing and 'pop' noise reduction. For subtle filtering try starting
  with values of alpha = 0.4, radius = 0.6 For a more blatant effect try alpha =
  0.5, radius = 1.0

<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Optimal_estimation_smoothing._(1.0_&lt;=_alpha_&lt;=_2.0)"><a class="selflink" href="#Optimal_estimation_smoothing._(1.0_&lt;=_alpha_&lt;=_2.0)">Optimal
  estimation smoothing. (1.0 &lt;= alpha &lt;= 2.0)</a></h2>
This type of filter applies a smoothing filter adaptively over the image. For
  each pixel the variance of the surrounding hexagon values is calculated, and
  the amount of smoothing is made inversely proportional to it. The idea is that
  if the variance is small then it is due to noise in the image, while if the
  variance is large, it is because of 'wanted' image features. As usual the
  radius parameter controls the effective radius, but it probably advisable to
  leave the radius between 0.8 and 1.0 for the variance calculation to be
  meaningful. The alpha parameter sets the noise threshold, over which less
  smoothing will be done. This means that small values of alpha will give the
  most subtle filtering effect, while large values will tend to smooth all parts
  of the image. You could start with values like alpha = 1.2, radius = 1.0 and
  try increasing or decreasing the alpha parameter to get the desired effect.
  This type of filter is best for filtering out dithering noise in both bitmap
  and color images.

  enhancement. (-0.1 &gt;= alpha &gt;= -0.9)</a></h2>
This is the opposite type of filter to the smoothing filter. It enhances edges.
  The alpha parameter controls the amount of edge enhancement, from subtle
  (-0.1) to blatant (-0.9). The radius parameter controls the effective radius
  as usual, but useful values are between 0.5 and 0.9. Try starting with values
  of alpha = 0.3, radius = 0.8

  use.</a></h2>
The various modes of <b>pnmnlfilt</b> can be used one after the other to get the
  desired result. For instance to turn a monochrome dithered image into a
  grayscale image you could try one or two passes of the smoothing filter,
  followed by a pass of the optimal estimation filter, then some subtle edge
  enhancement. Note that using edge enhancement is only likely to be useful
  after one of the non-linear filters (alpha trimmed mean or optimal estimation
  filter), as edge enhancement is the direct opposite of smoothing.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For reducing color quantization noise in images (ie. turning .gif files back
  into 24 bit files) you could try a pass of the optimal estimation filter
  (alpha 1.2, radius 1.0), a pass of the median filter (alpha 0.5, radius 0.55),
  and possibly a pass of the edge enhancement filter. Several passes of the
  optimal estimation filter with declining alpha values are more effective than
  a single pass with a large alpha value. As usual, there is a tradeoff between
  filtering effectiveness and losing detail. Experimentation is encouraged.

The alpha-trimmed mean filter is based on the description in IEEE CG&amp;A May
  1990 Page 23 by Mark E. Lee and Richard A. Redner, and has been enhanced to
  allow continuous alpha adjustment.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The optimal estimation filter is taken from an article 'Converting Dithered
  Images Back to Gray Scale' by Allen Stenger, Dr Dobb's Journal, November 1992,
  and this article references 'Digital Image Enhancement and Noise Filtering by
  Use of Local Statistics', Jong-Sen Lee, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis
  and Machine Intelligence, March 1980.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The edge enhancement details are from <b>pgmenhance</b>(1) , which is taken from
  Philip R. Thompson's 'xim' program, which in turn took it from section 6 of
  'Digital Halftones by Dot Diffusion', D. E. Knuth, ACM Transaction on Graphics
  Vol. 6, No. 4, October 1987, which in turn got it from two 1976 papers by J.
  F. Jarvis et. al.
