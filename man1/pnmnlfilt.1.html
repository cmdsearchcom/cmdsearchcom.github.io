<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pnmnlfilt - non-linear filters: smooth, alpha trim mean,
optimal estimation smoothing, edge enhancement.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pnmnlfilt alpha radius [pnmfile]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This program is part of Netpbm(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pnmnlfilt produces an output
image where the pixels are a summary of multiple pixels near
the corresponding location in an input image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This program works on
multi-image streams.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is something of a swiss
army knife filter. It has 3 distinct operating modes. In all
of the modes pnmnlfilt examines each pixel in the image and
processes it according to <br>
the values of it and its surrounding pixels. Rather than
using a square block of surrounding pixels (e.g. the subject
pixel and its 8 immediate neighbors, in a 3x3 square), <br>
pnmnlfilt uses 7 hexagonal areas. You choose the size of the
hexagons with the radius parameter. A radius value of 1/3
means that the 7 hexagons essentially fit into the
sub&acirc; <br>
ject pixel (ie. there will be no filtering effect). A radius
value of 1.0 means that the 7 hexagons essentially cover the
3x3 immediate neighbor square.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Your choice of
&rsquo;alpha&rsquo; parameter selects among the three
modes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alpha trimmed mean filter (0.0
&lt;= alpha &lt;= 0.5) <br>
The value of the center pixel will be replaced by the mean
of the 7 hexagon values, but the 7 values are sorted by size
and the top and bottom alpha portion of the 7 are excluded
<br>
from the mean. This implies that an alpha value of 0.0 gives
the same sort of output as a normal convolution (ie.
averaging or smoothing filter), where radius will determine
the <br>
&rsquo;strength&rsquo; of the filter. A good value to start
from for subtle filtering is alpha = 0.0, radius = 0.55 For
a more blatant effect, try alpha 0.0 and radius 1.0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An alpha value of 0.5 will cause
the median value of the 7 hexagons to be used to replace the
center pixel value. This sort of filter is good for
eliminating &rsquo;pop&rsquo; or single <br>
pixel noise from an image without spreading the noise out or
smudging features on the image. Judicious use of the radius
parameter will fine tune the filtering. Intermediate
val&acirc; <br>
ues of alpha give effects somewhere between smoothing and
&rsquo;pop&rsquo; noise reduction. For subtle filtering try
starting with values of alpha = 0.4, radius = 0.6 For a more
blatant <br>
effect try alpha = 0.5, radius = 1.0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Optimal estimation smoothing.
(1.0 &lt;= alpha &lt;= 2.0) <br>
This type of filter applies a smoothing filter adaptively
over the image. For each pixel the variance of the
surrounding hexagon values is calculated, and the amount of
smooth&acirc; <br>
ing is made inversely proportional to it. The idea is that
if the variance is small then it is due to noise in the
image, while if the variance is large, it is because of <br>
&rsquo;wanted&rsquo; image features. As usual the radius
parameter controls the effective radius, but it probably
advisable to leave the radius between 0.8 and 1.0 for the
variance calcula&acirc; <br>
tion to be meaningful. The alpha parameter sets the noise
threshold, over which less smoothing will be done. This
means that small values of alpha will give the most subtle
<br>
filtering effect, while large values will tend to smooth all
parts of the image. You could start with values like alpha =
1.2, radius = 1.0 and try increasing or decreasing the <br>
alpha parameter to get the desired effect. This type of
filter is best for filtering out dithering noise in both
bitmap and color images.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Edge enhancement. (-0.1 &gt;=
alpha &gt;= -0.9) <br>
This is the opposite type of filter to the smoothing filter.
It enhances edges. The alpha parameter controls the amount
of edge enhancement, from subtle (-0.1) to blatant (-0.9).
<br>
The radius parameter controls the effective radius as usual,
but useful values are between 0.5 and 0.9. Try starting with
values of alpha = 0.3, radius = 0.8</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Combination use. <br>
The various modes of pnmnlfilt can be used one after the
other to get the desired result. For instance to turn a
monochrome dithered image into a grayscale image you could
try <br>
one or two passes of the smoothing filter, followed by a
pass of the optimal estimation filter, then some subtle edge
enhancement. Note that using edge enhancement is only likely
<br>
to be useful after one of the non-linear filters (alpha
trimmed mean or optimal estimation filter), as edge
enhancement is the direct opposite of smoothing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For reducing color quantization
noise in images (ie. turning .gif files back into 24 bit
files) you could try a pass of the optimal estimation filter
(alpha 1.2, radius 1.0), a <br>
pass of the median filter (alpha 0.5, radius 0.55), and
possibly a pass of the edge enhancement filter. Several
passes of the optimal estimation filter with declining alpha
val&acirc; <br>
ues are more effective than a single pass with a large alpha
value. As usual, there is a tradeoff between filtering
effectiveness and losing detail. Experimentation is
encour&acirc; <br>
aged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">References: <br>
The alpha-trimmed mean filter is based on the description in
IEEE CG&amp;A May 1990 Page 23 by Mark E. Lee and Richard A.
Redner, and has been enhanced to allow continuous alpha <br>
adjustment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The optimal estimation filter is
taken from an article &rsquo;Converting Dithered Images Back
to Gray Scale&rsquo; by Allen Stenger, Dr Dobb&rsquo;s
Journal, November 1992, and this article refer&acirc; <br>

Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence,

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The edge enhancement details are
from pgmenhance(1) , which is taken from Philip R.
Thompson&rsquo;s &rsquo;xim&rsquo; program, which in turn
took it from section 6 of &rsquo;Digital Halftones by Dot

Diffusion&rsquo;, D. E. Knuth, ACM Transaction on Graphics
Vol. 6, No. 4, October 1987, which in turn got it from two
1976 papers by J. F. Jarvis et. al.</p>
