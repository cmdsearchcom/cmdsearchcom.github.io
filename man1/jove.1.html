<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
jove - an interactive display-oriented text editor</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
jove [ -d directory ] [ -l libdir ] [ -s sharedir ] [ -ls
bothdir ] [ -J ] [ -j ] [ -wn ] [ -t tag ] [ +n file ] [
+/pattern file ] [ -p file ] [ file... ] <br>
jove -r</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
JOVE is Jonathan&rsquo;s Own Version of Emacs. It is based
on the original EMACS editor written at MIT by Richard
Stallman. Although JOVE is meant to be compatible with
EMACS, there <br>
are some major differences between the two editors and you
shouldn&rsquo;t rely on their behaving identically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">JOVE works on any reasonable
display terminal that is described in the termcap file (see
TERMCAP(5) for more details). When you start up JOVE, it
checks to see whether you have <br>
your TERM environment variable set. On most systems that
will automatically be set up for you, but if it&rsquo;s not
JOVE will ask you what kind of terminal you are using. To
avoid <br>
having to type this every time you run JOVE you can set your
TERM environment variable yourself. How you do this depends
on which shell you are running. If you are running the <br>
C Shell, as most of you are, you type</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% setenv TERM type</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and with the Bourne Shell, you
type</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ TERM= type ; export TERM</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where type is the name of the
kind of terminal you are using (e.g., vt100). If neither of
these works get somebody to help you.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INVOKING JOVE <br>
If you run JOVE with no arguments you will be placed in an
empty buffer, called Main. Otherwise, any arguments you
supply are considered file names and each is
&lsquo;&lsquo;given&rsquo;&rsquo; its own <br>
buffer. Only the first file is actually read in &acirc;
reading other files is deferred until you actually try to
use the buffers they are attached to. This is for
efficiency&rsquo;s sake: <br>
most of the time, when you run JOVE on a big list of files,
you end up editing only a few of them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The names of all of the files
specified on the command line are saved in a buffer, called
*minibuf*. The mini-buffer is a special JOVE buffer that is
used when JOVE is prompting <br>
for some input to many commands (for example, when JOVE is
prompting for a file name). When you are being prompted for
a file name, you can type ^N (that&rsquo;s Control-N) and ^P
to <br>
cycle through the list of files that were specified on the
command line. The file name will be inserted where you are
typing and then you can edit it as if you typed it in <br>
yourself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">JOVE recognizes the following
switches:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d dirname <br>
dirname is taken to be the name of the current directory.
This is for systems that don&rsquo;t have a version of C
shell that automatically maintains the CWD environment <br>
variable. If -d is not specified on a system without a
modified C shell, JOVE will have to figure out the current
directory itself, and that can be slow. You can <br>
simulate the modified C shell by putting the following lines
in your C shell initialization file (.cshrc):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">alias cd &rsquo;cd *; setenv CWD
$cwd&rsquo; <br>
alias popd &rsquo;popd *; setenv CWD $cwd&rsquo; <br>
alias pushd &rsquo;pushd *; setenv CWD $cwd&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l libdir <br>
Allows the user to specify the directory in which binary
files required by JOVE can be found (default
/usr/lib/jove).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s sharedir <br>
Allows the user to specify the directory in which
initialization files required by JOVE can be found (default
/usr/lib/jove).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ls bothdir <br>
Allows the user to specify the directory in which binary
files and initialization files required by JOVE can be
found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-J Inhibits reading of the
system-wide initialization file (/usr/lib/jove/jove.rc).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-j Inhibits reading of the
user&rsquo;s initialization file (~/.joverc).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+n Reads the file designated by
the following argument, and positions point at the
n&rsquo;th line instead of the (default) first line. This
can be specified more than once but it <br>
doesn&rsquo;t make sense to use it twice on the same file;
in that case the second one wins. If no numeric argument is
given after the +, the point is positioned at the end of
<br>
the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+/pattern <br>
Reads the file designated by the following argument, and
positions point at the first match of the pattern.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p file <br>
Parses the error messages in file. The error messages are
assumed to be in a format similar to the C compiler, LINT,
or GREP output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t tag Runs the find-tag command
on tag (see ctags(1)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-wn Divides the window into n
windows (if n is omitted, it is taken to be 2). Subsequent
files in the list are read in and displayed in succeeding
windows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RECOVERING BUFFERS AFTER A CRASH
<br>
The -r option of jove runs the JOVE recover program. Use
this when the system crashes, or JOVE crashes, or you
accidently get logged out while in JOVE. If there are any
buffers <br>
to be recovered, this will find them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Recover looks for JOVE buffers
that are left around and are owned by you. (You cannot
recover other peoples&rsquo; buffers, obviously.) If there
were no buffers that were modified at <br>
the time of the crash or there were but recover can&rsquo;t
get its hands on them, you will be informed with the
message, &lsquo;&lsquo;There is nothing to
recover.&rsquo;&rsquo; Otherwise, recover prints <br>
the date and time of the version of the buffers it has, and
then waits for you type a command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To get a list of the buffers
recover knows about, use the list command. This will list
all the buffers and the files and the number of lines
associated with them. Next to each <br>
buffer is a number. When you want to recover a buffer, use
the get command. The syntax is get buffer filename where
buffer is either the buffer&rsquo;s name or the number at
the <br>
beginning of the line. If you don&rsquo;t type the buffer
name or the filename, recover will prompt you for them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If there are a lot of buffers
and you want to recover all of them, use the recover
command. This will recover each buffer to the name of the
buffer with &lsquo;&lsquo;.#&rsquo;&rsquo; prepended to the
<br>
name (so that the original isn&rsquo;t over-written). It
asks for each file and if you want to restore that buffer to
that name you type &lsquo;&lsquo;yes&rsquo;&rsquo;. If you
want to recover the file but <br>
to a different name, just type the new name in. If you type
&lsquo;&lsquo;no&rsquo;&rsquo; recover will skip that file
and go on to the next one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to look at a buffer
before deciding to recover it, use the print command. The
syntax for this is print buffer where buffer again is either
its name or the number. <br>
You can type ^C if you want to abort printing the file to
the terminal, and recover will respond with an appropriate
message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When you&rsquo;re done and have
all the buffers you want, type the quit command to leave.
You will then be asked whether it&rsquo;s okay to delete the
tmp files. Most of the time that&rsquo;s <br>
okay and you should type &lsquo;&lsquo;yes&rsquo;&rsquo;.
When you say that, JOVE removes all traces of those buffers
and you won&rsquo;t be able to look at them again. (If you
recovered some buffers they <br>
will still be around, so don&rsquo;t worry.) So, if
you&rsquo;re not sure whether you&rsquo;ve gotten all the
buffers, you should answer &lsquo;&lsquo;no&rsquo;&rsquo; so
that you&rsquo;ll be able to run recover again at a <br>
later time (presumably after you&rsquo;ve figured out which
ones you want to save). If there were more than one crashed
JOVE session, quit will move you on to dealing with the next
<br>
one instead of exiting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you type ^C at any time other
than when you&rsquo;re printing a file to the terminal,
recover will exit without a word. If you do this but wish
you hadn&rsquo;t, just type &lsquo;&lsquo;jove
-r&rsquo;&rsquo; to <br>
the shell again, and you will be put back with no loss.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GETTING HELP <br>
Once in JOVE, there are several commands available to get
help. To execute any JOVE command, you type
&lsquo;&lsquo;&lt;ESC&gt; X command-name&rsquo;&rsquo;
followed by &lt;Return&gt;. To get a list of all the <br>
JOVE commands you type &lsquo;&lsquo;&lt;ESC&gt;
X&rsquo;&rsquo; followed by &lsquo;&lsquo;?&rsquo;&rsquo;.
The describe-bindings command can be used to get a list
containing each key, and its associated command (that is,
the <br>
command that gets executed when you type that key). If you
want to save the list of bindings, you can set the jove
variable send-typeout-to-buffer to ON (using the set
command), <br>
and then execute the describe-bindings command. This will
create a buffer and put in it the bindings list it normally
would have printed on the screen. Then you can save that
<br>
buffer to a file and print it to use as a quick reference
card. (See VARIABLES below.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once you know the name of a
command, you can find out what it does with the
describe-command command, which you can invoke quickly by
typing &lsquo;&lsquo;ESC ?&rsquo;&rsquo;. The apropos
command will <br>
give you a list of all the command with a specific string in
their names. For example, if you want to know the names of
all the commands that are concerned with windows, you can
<br>
run &lsquo;&lsquo;apropos&rsquo;&rsquo; with the keyword
window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the initialization file has
provided specific keybindings for your terminal, it should
also be possible to view the keyboard layout with the
keychart macro.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you&rsquo;re not familiar
with the EMACS command set, it would be worth your while to
use run TEACHJOVE. Do do that, just type
&lsquo;&lsquo;teachjove&rsquo;&rsquo; to your shell and you
will be placed in <br>
JOVE in a file which contains directions. I highly recommend
this for beginners; you may save yourself a lot of time and
headaches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KEY BINDINGS and VARIABLES <br>
You can alter the key bindings in JOVE to fit your personal
tastes. That is, you can change what a key does every time
you strike it. For example, by default the ^N key is <br>
bound to the command next-line and so when you type it you
move down a line. If you want to change a binding or add a
new one, you use the bind-to-key command. The syntax is <br>
&lsquo;&lsquo;bind-to-key &lt;command&gt;
key&rsquo;&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also change the way JOVE
behaves in little ways by changing the value of some
variables with the set command. The syntax is
&lsquo;&lsquo;set &lt;variable&gt; value&rsquo;&rsquo;,
where value is a <br>
number or a string, or &lsquo;&lsquo;on&rsquo;&rsquo; or
&lsquo;&lsquo;off&rsquo;&rsquo;, depending on the context.
For example, if you want JOVE to make backup files, you set
the &lsquo;&lsquo;make-backup-files&rsquo;&rsquo; variable
to &lsquo;&lsquo;on&rsquo;&rsquo;. To <br>
see the value of a variable, use the &lsquo;&lsquo;print
&lt;variable&gt;&rsquo;&rsquo; command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INITIALIZATION <br>
JOVE first reads the system-wide initialization file
(/usr/lib/jove/jove.rc) which provides reasonable defaults
for your installation and loads standard macros. It will
normally <br>
observe your TERM environment variable in order to provide
terminal-specific key bindings and a map of your keyboard
(see the standard &lsquo;&lsquo;keychart&rsquo;&rsquo;
macro).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">JOVE then automatically reads
further commands from the initialization file called
&lsquo;&lsquo;.joverc&rsquo;&rsquo;
(&lsquo;&lsquo;jove.rc&rsquo;&rsquo; under MSDOS) in your
HOME directory. In this file you can place <br>
commands that you would normally type in JOVE. If you like
to rearrange the key bindings and set some variables every
time you get into JOVE, you should put them in your <br>
initialization file. Here are a few lines from mine: <br>
set match-regular-expressions on <br>
1 auto-execute-command auto-fill /tmp/Re.*drft <br>
bind-to-key i-search-forward ^ bind-to-key i-search-reverse
^R <br>
bind-to-key find-tag-at-point ^[^T <br>
bind-to-key scroll-down ^C <br>
bind-to-key grow-window ^Xg <br>
bind-to-key shrink-window ^Xs <br>
(Note that the Control Characters can be either two
character sequences (e.g. ^ and C together as ^C) or the
actual control character. If you want to use an ^ by itself
you must <br>
BackSlash it (e.g., bind-to-key grow-window ^X binds
grow-window to &lsquo;&lsquo;^X^&rsquo;&rsquo;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
If the variable LC_CTYPE (see environ(5)) is not set in the
environment, the operational behavior of JOVE for the
LC_CTYPE locale category is determined by the value of the
LANG <br>
environment variable. If LC_ALL is set, its contents are
used to override both the LANG and the LC_CTYPE variable. If
none of the above variables is set in the environment, the
<br>
&quot;C&quot; (U.S. style) locale determines how JOVE
behaves.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_CTYPE <br>
Determines how JOVE handles characters. When LC_CTYPE is set
to a valid value, JOVE can display and handle text and
filenames containing valid characters for that locale. <br>
In particular, characters will be correctly recognised as
upper or lower case and displayed if printable. However JOVE
cannot display or handle Extended Unix Code (EUC) <br>
characters which are more than 1 byte wide. In the
&quot;C&quot; locale, only characters from 7-bit ASCII are
valid (all characters with the eighth bit set being
displayed in <br>
octal). In the &quot;iso_8859_1&quot; locale (if supported
by the OS), the full Latin-1 alphabet is available. The JOVE
variable &lsquo;&lsquo;lc-ctype&rsquo;&rsquo; can be used to
change the locale while <br>
JOVE is running.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SOME MINOR DETAILS <br>
You should type ^&nbsp;instead of ^S in many instances. For
example, the way to search for a string is documented as
being &lsquo;&lsquo;^S&rsquo;&rsquo; but in reality you
should type &lsquo;&lsquo;^&acute;&rsquo;. This is <br>
because ^S is the XOFF character (what gets sent when you
type the NO SCROLL key), and clearly that won&rsquo;t work.
The XON character is &lsquo;&lsquo;^Q&rsquo;&rsquo; (what
gets sent when you type NO <br>
SCROLL again) which is documented as the way to do a
quoted-insert. The alternate key for this is
&lsquo;&lsquo;^^&rsquo;&rsquo; (typed as
&lsquo;&lsquo;^&lsquo;&rsquo;&rsquo; on vt100&rsquo;s and
its look-alikes). If you want to enable <br>
^S and ^Q and you know what you are doing, you can put the
line: <br>
set allow-^S-and-^Q on <br>
in your initialization file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If your terminal has a metakey
and you turn on the &lsquo;&lsquo;meta-key&rsquo;&rsquo;
variable, JOVE will use it to generate commands which would
otherwise start with an ESC. JOVE will automatically <br>
turn on &lsquo;&lsquo;meta-key&rsquo;&rsquo; if the METAKEY
environment variable exists. This is useful for if you have
different terminals (e.g., one at home and one at work) and
one has a metakey and <br>
the other doesn&rsquo;t. However, if a locale which
recognises 8-bit characters is in force, a metakey may be
better used to generate the extra characters (so leave the
&lsquo;&lsquo;meta-key&rsquo;&rsquo; <br>
variable off).</p>
