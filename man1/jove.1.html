JOVE is Jonathan's Own Version of Emacs. It is based on the original EMACS
  editor written at MIT by Richard Stallman. Although JOVE is meant to be
  compatible with EMACS, there are some major differences between the two
  editors and you shouldn't rely on their behaving identically.
<div class="Pp"></div>
JOVE works on any reasonable display terminal that is described in the
  <i>termcap</i> file (see TERMCAP(5) for more details). When you start up JOVE,
  it checks to see whether you have your <i>TERM</i> environment variable set.
  On most systems that will automatically be set up for you, but if it's not
  JOVE will ask you what kind of terminal you are using. To avoid having to type
  this every time you run JOVE you can set your <i>TERM</i> environment variable
  yourself. How you do this depends on which shell you are running. If you are
  running the C Shell, as most of you are, you type
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 % setenv TERM <i>type</i>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
and with the Bourne Shell, you type
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 $ TERM= <i>type</i> ; export TERM
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
where <i>type</i> is the name of the kind of terminal you are using (e.g.,
  vt100). If neither of these works get somebody to help you.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="INVOKING_JOVE"><a class="selflink" href="#INVOKING_JOVE">INVOKING
  JOVE</a></h1>
If you run JOVE with no arguments you will be placed in an empty buffer, called
  <i>Main.</i> Otherwise, any arguments you supply are considered file names and
  each is ``given'' its own buffer. Only the first file is actually read in
  &#x2014; reading other files is deferred until you actually try to use the
  buffers they are attached to. This is for efficiency's sake: most of the time,
  when you run JOVE on a big list of files, you end up editing only a few of
  them.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The names of all of the files specified on the command line are saved in a
  buffer, called <i>*minibuf*.</i> The mini-buffer is a special JOVE buffer that
  is used when JOVE is prompting for some input to many commands (for example,
  when JOVE is prompting for a file name). When you are being prompted for a
  file name, you can type ^N (that's Control-N) and ^P to cycle through the list
  of files that were specified on the command line. The file name will be
  inserted where you are typing and then you can edit it as if you typed it in
  yourself.
<div class="Pp"></div>
JOVE recognizes the following switches:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-d</b><i>&#x00A0;dirname</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><i>dirname</i> is taken to be the name of the current
      directory. This is for systems that don't have a version of C shell that
      automatically maintains the <i>CWD</i> environment variable. If <b>-d</b>
      is not specified on a system without a modified C shell, JOVE will have to
      figure out the current directory itself, and that can be slow. You can
      simulate the modified C shell by putting the following lines in your C
      shell initialization file (.cshrc):
    <pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
	alias cd        'cd \!*; setenv CWD $cwd'
	alias popd      'popd \!*; setenv CWD $cwd'

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="RECOVERING_BUFFERS_AFTER_A_CRASH"><a class="selflink" href="#RECOVERING_BUFFERS_AFTER_A_CRASH">RECOVERING
  BUFFERS AFTER A CRASH</a></h1>
The <b>-r</b> option of jove runs the JOVE recover program. Use this when the
  system crashes, or JOVE crashes, or you accidently get logged out while in
  JOVE. If there are any buffers to be recovered, this will find them.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Recover looks for JOVE buffers that are left around and are owned by you. (You
  cannot recover other peoples' buffers, obviously.) If there were no buffers
  that were modified at the time of the crash or there were but recover can't
  get its hands on them, you will be informed with the message, ``There is
  nothing to recover.'' Otherwise, recover prints the date and time of the
  version of the buffers it has, and then waits for you type a command.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To get a list of the buffers recover knows about, use the <i>list</i> command.
  This will list all the buffers and the files and the number of lines
  associated with them. Next to each buffer is a number. When you want to
  recover a buffer, use the <i>get</i> command. The syntax is <i>get buffer
  filename</i> where <i>buffer</i> is either the buffer's name or the number at
  the beginning of the line. If you don't type the buffer name or the filename,
  recover will prompt you for them.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If there are a lot of buffers and you want to recover all of them, use the
  <i>recover</i> command. This will recover each buffer to the name of the
  buffer with ``.#'' prepended to the name (so that the original isn't
  over-written). It asks for each file and if you want to restore that buffer to
  that name you type ``yes''. If you want to recover the file but to a different
  name, just type the new name in. If you type ``no'' recover will skip that
  file and go on to the next one.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you want to look at a buffer before deciding to recover it, use the
  <i>print</i> command. The syntax for this is <i>print buffer</i> where
  <i>buffer</i> again is either its name or the number. You can type ^C if you
  want to abort printing the file to the terminal, and recover will respond with
  an appropriate message.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When you're done and have all the buffers you want, type the <i>quit</i> command
  to leave. You will then be asked whether it's okay to delete the tmp files.
  Most of the time that's okay and you should type ``yes''. When you say that,
  JOVE removes all traces of those buffers and you won't be able to look at them
  again. (If you recovered some buffers they will still be around, so don't
  worry.) So, if you're not sure whether you've gotten all the buffers, you
  should answer ``no'' so that you'll be able to run recover again at a later
  time (presumably after you've figured out which ones you want to save). If
  there were more than one crashed JOVE session, <i>quit</i> will move you on to
  dealing with the next one instead of exiting.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you type ^C at any time other than when you're printing a file to the
  terminal, recover will exit without a word. If you do this but wish you
  hadn't, just type ``jove -r'' to the shell again, and you will be put back
  with no loss.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="GETTING_HELP"><a class="selflink" href="#GETTING_HELP">GETTING
  HELP</a></h1>
Once in JOVE, there are several commands available to get help. To execute any
  JOVE command, you type ``&lt;ESC&gt; X command-name'' followed by
  &lt;Return&gt;. To get a list of all the JOVE commands you type ``&lt;ESC&gt;
  X'' followed by ``?''. The <i>describe-bindings</i> command can be used to get
  a list containing each key, and its associated command (that is, the command
  that gets executed when you type that key). If you want to save the list of
  bindings, you can set the jove variable <i>send-typeout-to-buffer</i> to ON
  (using the <i>set</i> command), and then execute the <i>describe-bindings</i>
  command. This will create a buffer and put in it the bindings list it normally
  would have printed on the screen. Then you can save that buffer to a file and
  print it to use as a quick reference card. (See VARIABLES below.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
Once you know the name of a command, you can find out what it does with the
  <i>describe-command</i> command, which you can invoke quickly by typing ``ESC
  ?''. The <i>apropos</i> command will give you a list of all the command with a
  specific string in their names. For example, if you want to know the names of
  all the commands that are concerned with windows, you can run ``apropos'' with
  the keyword <i>window.</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the initialization file has provided specific keybindings for your terminal,
  it should also be possible to view the keyboard layout with the keychart
  macro.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you're not familiar with the EMACS command set, it would be worth your while
  to use run TEACHJOVE. Do do that, just type ``teachjove'' to your shell and
  you will be placed in JOVE in a file which contains directions. I highly
  recommend this for beginners; you may save yourself a lot of time and
  headaches.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="KEY_BINDINGS_and_VARIABLES"><a class="selflink" href="#KEY_BINDINGS_and_VARIABLES">KEY
  BINDINGS and VARIABLES</a></h1>
You can alter the key bindings in JOVE to fit your personal tastes. That is, you
  can change what a key does every time you strike it. For example, by default
  the ^N key is bound to the command <i>next-line</i> and so when you type it
  you move down a line. If you want to change a binding or add a new one, you
  use the <i>bind-to-key</i> command. The syntax is ``bind-to-key
  &lt;command&gt; key''.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can also change the way JOVE behaves in little ways by changing the value of
  some variables with the <i>set</i> command. The syntax is ``set
  &lt;variable&gt; value'', where value is a number or a string, or ``on'' or
  ``off'', depending on the context. For example, if you want JOVE to make
  backup files, you set the ``make-backup-files'' variable to ``on''. To see the
  value of a variable, use the ``print &lt;variable&gt;'' command.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="INITIALIZATION"><a class="selflink" href="#INITIALIZATION">INITIALIZATION</a></h1>
JOVE first reads the system-wide initialization file (/usr/lib/jove/jove.rc)
  which provides reasonable defaults for your installation and loads standard
  macros. It will normally observe your TERM environment variable in order to
  provide terminal-specific key bindings and a map of your keyboard (see the
  standard ``keychart'' macro).
<div class="Pp"></div>
JOVE then automatically reads further commands from the initialization file
  called ``.joverc'' (``jove.rc'' under MSDOS) in your HOME directory. In this
  file you can place commands that you would normally type in JOVE. If you like
  to rearrange the key bindings and set some variables every time you get into
  JOVE, you should put them in your initialization file. Here are a few lines
  from mine:
<pre>
	set match-regular-expressions on
	1 auto-execute-command auto-fill /tmp/Re\|.*drft
	bind-to-key i-search-forward ^\
	bind-to-key i-search-reverse ^R
	bind-to-key find-tag-at-point ^[^T
	bind-to-key scroll-down ^C
	bind-to-key grow-window ^Xg
	bind-to-key shrink-window ^Xs
</pre>
(Note that the Control Characters can be either two character sequences (e.g. ^
  and C together as ^C) or the actual control character. If you want to use an ^
  by itself you must BackSlash it (e.g., bind-to-key grow-window ^X\^ binds
  grow-window to ``^X^'').
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ENVIRONMENT"><a class="selflink" href="#ENVIRONMENT">ENVIRONMENT</a></h1>
If the variable <small><b>LC_CTYPE</b></small> (see <b>environ</b>(5)) is not
  set in the environment, the operational behavior of JOVE for the
  <small><b>LC_CTYPE</b></small> locale category is determined by the value of
  the <small><b>LANG</b></small> environment variable. If
  <small><b>LC_ALL</b></small> is set, its contents are used to override both
  the <small><b>LANG</b></small> and the <small><b>LC_CTYPE</b></small>
  variable. If none of the above variables is set in the environment, the
  &quot;C&quot; (U.S. style) locale determines how JOVE behaves.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><small><b>LC_CTYPE</b></small></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Determines how JOVE handles characters. When
      <small><b>LC_CTYPE</b></small> is set to a valid value, JOVE can display
      and handle text and filenames containing valid characters for that locale.
      In particular, characters will be correctly recognised as upper or lower
      case and displayed if printable. However JOVE cannot display or handle
      Extended Unix Code (EUC) characters which are more than 1 byte wide. In
      the &quot;C&quot; locale, only characters from 7-bit ASCII are valid (all
      characters with the eighth bit set being displayed in octal). In the
      &quot;iso_8859_1&quot; locale (if supported by the OS), the full Latin-1
      alphabet is available. The JOVE variable ``lc-ctype'' can be used to
      change the locale while JOVE is running.</dd>
</dl>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SOME_MINOR_DETAILS"><a class="selflink" href="#SOME_MINOR_DETAILS">SOME
  MINOR DETAILS</a></h1>
You should type ^\ instead of ^S in many instances. For example, the way to
  search for a string is documented as being ``^S'' but in reality you should
  type ``^\''. This is because ^S is the XOFF character (what gets sent when you
  type the NO SCROLL key), and clearly that won't work. The XON character is
  ``^Q'' (what gets sent when you type NO SCROLL again) which is documented as
  the way to do a quoted-insert. The alternate key for this is ``^^'' (typed as
  ``^`'' on vt100's and its look-alikes). If you want to enable ^S and ^Q and
  you know what you are doing, you can put the line:
<pre>
	set allow-^S-and-^Q on
</pre>
in your initialization file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If your terminal has a metakey and you turn on the ``meta-key'' variable, JOVE
  will use it to generate commands which would otherwise start with an ESC. JOVE
  will automatically turn on ``meta-key'' if the METAKEY environment variable
  exists. This is useful for if you have different terminals (e.g., one at home
  and one at work) and one has a metakey and the other doesn't. However, if a
  locale which recognises 8-bit characters is in force, a metakey may be better
  used to generate the extra characters (so leave the ``meta-key'' variable
  off).
