<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
hmmpgmd - daemon for searching a protein query against a
protein database</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
hmmpgmd [options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The hmmpgmd program is the daemon that we use internally for
the hmmer.org web server, and essentially stands in front of
the protein search programs phmmer, hmmsearch, and
hmm&acirc; <br>
scan.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To use hmmpgmd, first an
instance must be started up as a master server, and provided
with at least one of a sequence database (using the --seqdb
flag) and/or an HMM database <br>
(using the --hmmdb flag). A sequence database must be in the
hmmpgmd format, which may be produced using esl-reformat. An
HMM database is of the form produced by hmmbuild. The <br>
input database(s) will be loaded into memory by the master.
When the master has finished loading the database(s), it
prints the line: &quot;Data loaded into memory. Master is
ready.&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Only after master is ready, one
or more instances of hmmpgmd may be started as workers.
These workers may be (and typically are) on different
machines from the master, but must <br>
have access to the same database file(s) provided to the
master, with the same path. As with the master, each worker
loads the database(s) into memory, and indicates completion
<br>
by printing: &quot;Data loaded into memory. Worker is
ready.&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The master server and workers
are expected to remain running. One or more clients then
connect to the master and submit possibly many queries. The
master distributes the work of <br>
a query among the workers, collects results, and merges them
before responding to the client. Two example client programs
are included in the HMMER3.1 src directory - the C
pro&acirc; <br>
gram hmmc2 and the perl script hmmpgmd_client_example.pl.
These are intended as examples only, and should be extended
as necessary to meet your needs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A query is submitted to the
master from the client as a character string. Queries may be
the sort that would normally be handled by phmmer (protein
sequence vs protein database), <br>
hmmsearch (protein HMM query vs protein database), or
hmmscan (protein query vs protein HMM database).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The general form of a client
query is to start with a single line of the form @[options],
followed by multiple lines of text representing either the
query HMM or fasta-formatted <br>
sequence. The final line of each query is the separator
//.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, to perform a phmmer
type search of a sequence against a sequence database file,
the first line is of the form @--seqdb 1, then the
fasta-formatted query sequence <br>
starting with the header line &gt;sequence-name, followed by
one or more lines of sequence, and finally the closing
//.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To perform an hmmsearch type
search, the query sequence is replaced by the full text of a
HMMER-format query HMM.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To perform an hmmscan type
search, the text matches that of the phmmer type search,
except that the first line changes to @--hmmdb 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the hmmpgmd-formatted
sequence database file, each sequence can be associated with
one or more sub-databases. The --seqdb flag indicates which
of these sub-databases will be <br>
queried. The HMM database format does not support
sub-databases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The result of each query is an
undocumented data structure in binary format. In the future
the data will be returned in a proper serialized structure,
but for now, it requires <br>
meticulous unpacking within the client. The example clients
show how this is done.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-h Help; print a brief reminder of command line usage and
all available options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXPERT OPTIONS <br>
--master <br>
Run as the master server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--worker &lt;s&gt; <br>
Run as a worker, connecting to the master server that is
running on IP address &lt;s&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--daemon <br>
Run as a daemon using config file: /etc/hmmpgmd.conf</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--cport &lt;n&gt; <br>
Port to use for communication between clients and the master
server. The default is 51371.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--wport &lt;n&gt; <br>
Port to use for communication between workers and the master
server. The default is 51372.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ccncts &lt;n&gt; <br>
Maximum number of client connections to accept. The default
is 16.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--wcncts &lt;n&gt; <br>
Maximum number of worker connections to accept. The default
is 32.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--pid &lt;f&gt; <br>
Name of file into which the process id will be written.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--seqdb &lt;f&gt; <br>
Name of the file (in hmmpgmd format) containing protein
sequences. The contents of this file will be cached for
searches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--hmmdb &lt;f&gt; <br>
Name of the file containing protein HMMs. The contents of
this file will be cached for searches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--cpu &lt;n&gt; <br>
Number of parallel threads to use (for --worker ).</p>
