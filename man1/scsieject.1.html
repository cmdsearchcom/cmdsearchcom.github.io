<p>scsieject(1) General Commands Manual scsieject(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
scsieject - control SCSI tape devices</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
scsieject [-f &lt;scsi-generic-device&gt;] commands</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The scsieject command controls SCSI devices in a
platform-independent manner. As long as &rsquo;mtx&rsquo;
works on the platform, so does &rsquo;scsieject&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The first argument, given following -f , is the SCSI generic
device corresponding to your tape drive. Consult your
operating system&rsquo;s documentation for more information
(for <br>
example, under Linux these are generally /dev/sg0 through
/dev/sg15, under FreeBSD these are /dev/pass0 through
/dev/passX. Under Solaris this is usually the same as your
tape <br>
drive (Solaris has a SCSI passthrough ioctl). You can set
the STAPE or TAPE environment variable rather than use
-f.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMANDS <br>
load Load the medium into the drive. When this command is
issued to a CD/DVD drive and the tray is extended the tray
will be retracted if the drive is capable of it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unload Unload the medium from
the drive (also known as eject). When this command is issued
to a CD/DVD drive or a tape drive the media will be ejected
if the device supports <br>
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">start Start the device. Some
devices require a start command after a media changer has
loaded new media into the device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">stop Stop the device. Some
devices require a stop command prior to unloading the medium
from the device when using a media changer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lock Lock the device. Locks the
device so that the medium cannot be removed manually.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unlock Unlock the device.
Unlocks the device so that the medium can be removed
manually.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHORS <br>
This program was written by Robert Nelson
&lt;robertnelson@users.sourceforge.net&gt; based on the
scsitape program written by Eric Lee Green
&lt;eric@badtux.org&gt;. Major portions of the <br>
&rsquo;mtxl.c&rsquo; library used herein were written by
Leonard Zubkoff.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HINTS <br>
Under Linux, cat /proc/scsi/scsi will tell you what SCSI
devices you have. You can then refer to them as /dev/sga,
/dev/sgb, etc. by the order they are reported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Under FreeBSD, camcontrol
devlist will tell you what SCSI devices you have, along with
which pass device controls them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Under Solaris 7 and 8,
/usr/sbin/devfsadm -C will clean up your /devices directory.
Then find /devices -name &rsquo;st@*&rsquo; -print will
return a list of all tape drives. /dev on Solaris <br>
is apparently only of historical interest.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS AND LIMITATIONS <br>
There are no known bugs or limitations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AVAILABILITY <br>
This version of scsieject is currently being maintained by
Robert Nelson &lt;robertnelson@users.sourceforge.net&gt; as
part of the &rsquo;mtx&rsquo; suite of programs. The
&rsquo;mtx&rsquo; home page is <br>
http://mtx.sourceforge.net and the actual code is currently
available there and via SVN from
http://sourceforge.net/projects/mtx.</p>
