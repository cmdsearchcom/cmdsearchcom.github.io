<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
edinplace - edit a file in place</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
edinplace [--error=code] [[--file=file] command [arg
...]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
edinplace runs command with its input from file (or standard
input by default), and then replaces the contents of file
with the output of command. To the extent possible, <br>
edinplace attempts to exit with the same status as
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If edinplace is run on standard
input (no --file option), it must inherit a file descriptor
0 that is open for both reading and writing. When processing
standard input, if <br>
edinplace does not encounter a fatal error, it rewinds its
standard input to offset 0 before exiting. Thus, a script
can first run edinplace command, then run another filter
<br>
command such as grep, and the resulting output will be the
output of grep on command&rsquo;s output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no command is specified,
edinplace just rewinds its standard input to file offset 0.
In this case, it is an error to supply the --file option. Of
course, rewinding only <br>
works when standard input is a real file (as opposed to a
pipe or device).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are two options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--error=code (-x code) <br>
Ordinarily, edinplace attempts to exit with the same status
as command. However, if edinplace encounters some fatal
error (such as being unable to execute command), it will
<br>
exit with status code. The default value is 1. The range of
valid exit codes is 1-255, inclusive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--file=file (-f file) <br>
Specifies that file should be edited. Otherwise, edinplace
will edit its standard input (which must be opened for both
reading and writing).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--skipfrom <br>
Skip the first line of the file if it starts &quot;From
&quot;. If edinplace is run without a command, positions the
file offset at the start of the second line of the file. If
<br>
edinplace is run with a command, then the first line of the
file is neither fed to the command, nor overwritten. This
option is useful for running edinplace over mail files, <br>
which sometimes start with a &quot;From &quot; line
specifying the envelope sender of the message. Since
&quot;From &quot; is not part of the message header, just a
Unix convention, some <br>
programs are confused by the presence of that line. Note
that if you specify a command, then edinplace resets the
file offset to 0 upon exiting, even if the --skipfrom <br>
option was present.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
The following command prepends the string &quot;ORIGINAL:
&quot; to the beginning of each line in text file
message:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">edinplace -f message sed -e
&rsquo;s/^/ORIGINAL: /&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following command runs the
spamassassin mail filter program on a mail message stored in
file message, replacing the contents of message with
spamassassin&rsquo;s annotated output, <br>
and exiting with code 100 if spamassassin thinks the message
is spam. If edinplace encounters any fatal errors, it will
exit with code 111.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">edinplace -x 111 -f message
spamassassin -e 100</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(spamassassin reads a mail
message on standard input and outputs an annotated copy of
the message including information about whether or not the
message is likely to be spam and <br>
why. The -e option to spamassassin specifies what exit
status spamassassin should use if the message appears to be
spam; edinplace will use the same exit code as the program
it <br>
has run.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To run spamassassin on incoming
mail before accepting the mail from the remote client, place
the following line in an appropriate Mail Avenger rcpt file
as the last command <br>
executed:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bodytest edinplace -x 111
spamassassin -e 100</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Mail Avenger home page:
&lt;http://www.mailavenger.org/&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
edinplace does not make a copy of the file being edited, but
rather overwrites the file as it is being processed. At any
point where command has produced more output than it has
<br>
consumed input from the file, edinplace buffers the
difference in memory. Thus, a command that outputs large
amounts of data before reading the input file can run
edinplace out <br>
of memory. (A program that outputs data as it reads even a
very large file should be fine, however.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If command crashes or
malfunctions for any reason, you will likely lose the input
file, since edinplace will view this as a program that
simply outputs the empty file.</p>
