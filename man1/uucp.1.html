<p>uucp(1) General Commands Manual uucp(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
uucp - Unix to Unix copy</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
uucp [ options ] source-file destination-file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">uucp [ options ] source-file...
destination-directory</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The uucp command copies files between systems. Each file
argument is either a pathname on the local machine or is of
the form</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">system!path</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">which is interpreted as being on
a remote system. In the first form, the contents of the
first file are copied to the second. In the second form,
each source file is copied <br>
into the destination directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A file be transferred to or from
system2 via system1 by using</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">system1!system2!path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any pathname that does not begin
with / or ~ will be appended to the current directory
(unless the -W or --noexpand option is used); this resulting
path will not necessarily <br>
exist on a remote system. A pathname beginning with a simple
~ starts at the UUCP public directory; a pathname beginning
with ~name starts at the home directory of the named <br>
user. The ~ is interpreted on the appropriate system. Note
that some shells will interpret a simple ~ to the local home
directory before uucp sees it; to avoid this the ~ must <br>
be quoted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Shell metacharacters ? * [ ] are
interpreted on the appropriate system, assuming they are
quoted to prevent the shell from interpreting them
first.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The copy does not take place
immediately, but is queued up for the uucico (8) daemon; the
daemon is started immediately unless the -r or --nouucico
switch is given. In any case, <br>
the next time the remote system is called the file(s) will
be copied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The following options may be given to uucp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --nocopy <br>
Do not copy local source files to the spool directory. If
they are removed before being processed by the uucico (8)
daemon, the copy will fail. The files must be readable <br>
by the uucico (8) daemon, and by the invoking user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C, --copy <br>
Copy local source files to the spool directory. This is the
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --directories <br>
Create all necessary directories when doing the copy. This
is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, --nodirectories <br>
If any necessary directories do not exist for the
destination path, abort the copy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R, --recursive <br>
If any of the source file names are directories, copy their
contents recursively to the destination (which must itself
be a directory).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g grade, --grade grade <br>
Set the grade of the file transfer command. Jobs of a higher
grade are executed first. Grades run 0 ... 9 A ... Z a ... z
from high to low.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m, --mail <br>
Report completion or failure of the file transfer by mail
(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n user, --notify user <br>
Report completion or failure of the file transfer by mail
(1) to the named user on the remote system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, --nouucico <br>
Do not start uucico (8) daemon immediately; merely queue up
the file transfer for later execution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-j, --jobid <br>
Print jobid on standard output. The job may be later
cancelled by passing the jobid to the -k switch of uustat
(1). It is possible for some complex operations to produce
<br>
more than one jobid, in which case each will be printed on a
separate line. For example <br>
uucp sys1!~user1/file1 sys2!~user2/file2 ~user3 <br>
will generate two separate jobs, one for the system sys1 and
one for the system sys2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-W, --noexpand <br>
Do not prepend remote relative path names with the current
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t, --uuto <br>
This option is used by the uuto shell script. It causes uucp
to interpret the final argument as system!user. The file(s)
are sent to ~/receive/USER/LOCAL on the remote <br>
system, where USER is from the final argument and LOCAL is
the local UUCP system name. Also, uucp will act as though
--notify user were specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x type, --debug type <br>
Turn on particular debugging types. The following types are
recognized: abnormal, chat, handshake, uucp-proto, proto,
port, config, spooldir, execute, incoming, outgoing. <br>
Only abnormal, config, spooldir and execute are meaningful
for uucp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Multiple types may be given,
separated by commas, and the --debug option may appear
multiple times. A number may also be given, which will turn
on that many types from the <br>
foregoing list; for example, --debug 2 is equivalent to
--debug abnormal,chat.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I file, --config file <br>
Set configuration file to use. This option may not be
available, depending upon how uucp was compiled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --version <br>
Report version information and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help <br>
Print a help message and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
mail(1), uux(1), uustat(1), uucico(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Some of the options are dependent on the capabilities of the
uucico (8) daemon on the remote system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -n and -m switches do not
work when transferring a file from one remote system to
another.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File modes are not preserved,
except for the execute bit. The resulting file is owned by
the uucp user.</p>
