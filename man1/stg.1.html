<p>STG(1) StGit Manual STG(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
stg - Manage stacks of patches using the Git content
tracker</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
stg [--version | --help] <br>
stg [--help &lt;command&gt; | &lt;command&gt; --help] <br>
stg &lt;command&gt; [COMMAND OPTIONS] [ARGS]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
StGit (Stacked Git) is an application that provides a
convenient way to maintain a patch stack on top of a Git
branch:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The topmost
(most recent) commits of a branch are given names. Such a
named commit is called a patch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; After making
changes to the worktree, you can incorporate the changes
into an existing patch; this is called refreshing. You may
refresh any patch, not just the topmost one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; You can pop a
patch: temporarily putting it aside, so that the patch below
it becomes the topmost patch. Later you may push it onto the
stack again. Pushing and popping can <br>
be used to reorder patches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; You can easily
rebase your patch stack on top of any other Git commit. (The
base of a patch stack is the most recent Git commit that is
not an StGit patch.) For example, if <br>
you started making patches on top of someone else&acirc;s
branch, and that person publishes an updated branch, you can
take all your patches and apply them on top of the updated
<br>
branch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; As you would
expect, changing what is below a patch can cause that patch
to no longer apply cleanly &acirc; this can occur when you
reorder patches, rebase patches, or refresh a <br>
non-topmost patch. StGit uses Git&acirc;s rename-aware
three-way merge capability to automatically fix up what it
can; if it still fails, it lets you manually resolve the
conflict <br>
just like you would resolve a merge conflict in Git.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The patch stack
is just some extra metadata attached to regular Git commits,
so you can continue to use most Git tools along with
StGit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Typical uses <br>
Tracking branch <br>
Tracking changes from a remote branch, while maintaining
local modifications against that branch, possibly with the
intent of sending some patches upstream. You can modify <br>
your patch stack as much as you want, and when your patches
are finally accepted upstream, the permanent recorded Git
history will contain just the final sequence of patches,
<br>
and not the messy sequence of edits that produced them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Commands of interest in this
workflow are e.g. rebase and mail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Development branch <br>
Even if you have no &quot;upstream&quot; to send patches to,
you can use StGit as a convenient way to modify the recent
history of a Git branch. For example, instead of first <br>
committing change A, then change B, and then A2 to fix A
because it wasn&acirc;t quite right, you could incorporate
the fix directly into A. This way of working results in a
much <br>
more readable Git history than if you had immortalized every
misstep you made on your way to the right solution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Commands of interest in this
workflow are e.g. uncommit, which can be used to move the
patch stack base downwards &acirc; i.e., turn Git commits
into StGit patches after the fact &acirc; <br>
and commit, its inverse. <br>
For more information, see the tutorial[1].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specifying patches <br>
Many StGit commands take references to StGit patches as
arguments. Patches in the stack are identified with short
names, each of which must be unique in the stack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Patches in the current branch
are simply referred to by their name. Some commands allow
you to specify a patch in another branch of the repository;
this is done by prefixing the <br>
patch name with the branch name and a colon (e.g.
otherbranch:thatpatch).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specifying commits <br>
Some StGit commands take Git commits as arguments. StGit
accepts all commit expressions that Git does; and in
addition, a patch name (optionally prefixed by a branch name
and a <br>
colon) is allowed in this context. The usual Git modifiers ^
and ~ are also allowed; e.g., abranch:apatch~2 is the
grandparent of the commit that is the patch apatch on branch
<br>
abranch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Instead of a patch name, you can
say {base} to refer to the stack base (the commit just below
the bottommost patch); so, abranch:{base} is the base of the
stack in branch <br>
abranch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you need to pass a given
StGit reference to a Git command, stg-id(1) will convert it
to a Git commit id for you.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The following generic option flags are available. Additional
options are available for (and documented with) the
different subcommands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Prints the StGit version, as well as version of other
components used, such as Git and Python.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help <br>
Prints the synopsis and a list of all subcommands. If an
StGit subcommand is given, prints the synposis for that
subcommand.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STGIT COMMANDS <br>
We divide StGit commands in thematic groups, according to
the primary type of object they create or change.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here is a short description of
each command. A more detailed description is available in
individual command manpages. Those manpages are named
stg-&lt;command&gt;(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TEMPLATES <br>
A number of StGit commands make use of template files to
provide useful default texts to be edited by the user. These
&lt;name&gt;.tmpl template files are searched in the
following <br>
directories:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. $GITDIR/ (in practice, the
.git/ directory in your repository)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. $HOME/.stgit/templates/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3.
/usr/share/stgit/templates/</p>
