DONUTS(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
donuts - analyze DNS zone files for errors and warnings</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
donuts [-v] [-l LEVEL] [-r RULEFILES] [-i IGNORELIST] <br>
[-C] [-c configfile] [-h] [-H] ZONEFILE DOMAINNAME...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
donuts is a DNS lint application that examines DNS zone
files looking for particular problems. This is especially
important for zones making use of DNSSEC security records,
<br>
since many subtle problems can occur. The default mode of
operation assumes you want to check for DNSSEC-related
issues; to turn off the invocation of the DNSSEC-related
rules <br>
run donuts with &quot;-i DNSSEC&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the Text::Wrap Perl module is
installed, donuts will give better output formatting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">QUERYING LIVE ZONES <br>
If the ZONEFILE may be a live name prefixed with
&quot;live:&quot; and the records afterwards will be queried
and analyized as if it was in a zonefile. For example,
running donuts as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">donuts -i NSEC
live:badsign-a,good-a test.dnssec-tools.org</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Will query the
test.dnssec-tools.org zone for the badsign-a and good-a
records, collect the data and run them through the donuts
analysis. Because other data is needed as well <br>
for the analysis to be useful, donuts will also
automatically collect the DNSKEYs, SOAs, and NS records for
the zone. Because NSEC records aren&rsquo;t loaded, it is
advisable to add <br>
that rule exclusion for rules to be run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other data types may be queried
by appending a &rsquo;:&rsquo; and the type name to a
record. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">donuts -i NSEC
live:good-a,good-aaaa:aaaa test.dnssec-tools.org</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">QUERYING LIVE ZONES WITH AFXR
<br>
If your host is allowed to query for afxr transfers of a
particular zone, you may use the afxr: filename token to
indicate it should pull the zone data using a AFXR
transfer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">donuts -i NSEC afxr:
dnssec-tools.org</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Rule Set Configuration: <br>
-l LEVEL <br>
--level=LEVEL <br>
Sets the level of errors to be displayed. The default is
level 5. The maximum value is level 9, which displays many
debugging results. You probably want to run no higher <br>
than level 8.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r RULEFILES <br>
--rules=RULEFILES <br>
A comma-separated list of rule files to load. The strings
will be passed to glob() so * wildcards can be used to
specify multiple files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Defaults to
/usr/local/share/dnssec-tools/donuts/rules/*.txt and
$HOME/.dnssec-tools/donuts/rules/*.txt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i IGNORELIST <br>
--ignore=IGNORELIST <br>
A comma-separated list of regex patterns which are checked
against rule names to determine if some should be ignored.
Run with -v to figure out rule names if you&rsquo;re not
sure <br>
which rule is generating errors you don&rsquo;t wish to
see.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f LIST <br>
--features=LIST <br>
The --features option specifies additional rule features
that should be executed. Some rules are turned off by
default because they are more intensive or require a live
<br>
network connection, for instance. Use the --features flag to
turn them on. The LIST argument should be a comma-separated
list. Example usage:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--features live,nsec_check</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Features available in the
default rule set distributed with donuts:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">live <br>
The live feature allows rules that need to perform live DNS
queries to run. Most of these live rules query parent and
children of the current zone, when appropriate, to <br>
see that the parent/child relationships have been built
properly. For example, if you have a DS record which
authenticates the key used in a child zone the live feature
<br>
will let a rule run which checks to see if the child is
actually publishing the DNSKEY that corresponds to the test
zone&rsquo;s DS record.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nsec_check <br>
This checks all the NSEC or NSEC3 records (as appropriate
for the zone) to ensure the chain is complete and that
no-overlaps exist. It is fairly memory- and cpu- <br>
intensive in large zones.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Configuration File Options: <br>
-c CONFIGFILE <br>
--config-file=CONFIGFILE <br>
Parse a configuration file to change constraints specified
by rules. This defaults to $HOME/.donuts.conf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C <br>
--no-config <br>
Don&rsquo;t read user configuration files at all, such as
those specified by the -c option or the $HOME/.donuts.conf
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Extra Live Query Options: <br>
Live Queries are enabled through the use of the -f live
arguments. These options are only useful if that feature has
been enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t INTERFACE <br>
--tcpdump-capture=INTERFACE <br>
Specifies that tcpdump should be started on INTERFACE (e.g.,
&quot;eth0&quot;) just before donuts begins its run of rules
for each domain and will stop it just after it has processed
<br>
the rules. This is useful when you wish to capture the
traffic generated by the live feature, described above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T FILTER <br>
--tcpdump-filter=FILTER <br>
When tcpdump is run, this FILTER is passed to it for
purposes of filtering traffic. By default, this is set to
port 53 || ip[6:2] &amp; 0x1fff != 0, which limits the
traffic to <br>
traffic destined to port 53 (DNS) or fragmented packets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o FILE <br>
--tcpdump-output-file=FILE <br>
Saves the tcpdump-captured packets to FILE. The following
special fields can be used to help generate unique file
names:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%d This is replaced with the
current domain name being analyzed (e.g.,
&quot;example.com&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%t This is replaced with the
current epoch time (i.e., the number of seconds since Jan 1,
1970).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This field defaults to
%d.%t.pcap.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--show-gui <br>
[alpha code]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Displays a browsable GUI screen
showing the results of the donuts tests.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The QWizard and Gtk2 Perl
modules must be installed for this to work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Help Options <br>
-H Displays the personal configuration file rules and tokens
that are acceptable in a configuration file. The output will
consist of a rule name, a token, and a description of <br>
its meaning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Your configuration file (e.g.,
$HOME/.donuts.conf) may have lines in it that look like
this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># change the default minimum
number of legal NS records from 2 to 1 <br>
name: DNS_MULTIPLE_NS <br>
minnsrecords: 1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># change the level of the
following rule from 8 to 5 <br>
name: DNS_REASONABLE_TTLS <br>
level: 5</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This allows you to override
certain aspects of how rules are executed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R Displays a list of all known
rules along with their description (if available).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Displays a help message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help <br>
Displays a help message more tailored to people who prefer
long-style options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Turns on a quieter output
mode where only the errors and warnings are shown. IE, the
summary line of &quot;N errors found ...&quot; is not
shown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q is ignored if a -v argument
is present; the -v argument requests a longer output summary
and thus it doesn&rsquo;t make sense to use them both at the
same time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Turns on more verbose output.
Multiple -v&rsquo;s will turn on increasing amounts of
output. The number of -v&rsquo;s will dictate output:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Sorts the resource records so
that the order they&rsquo;re processed in is always
consistent. If the incoming zone is not always consistently
ordered, the output can vary unless <br>
the resource records are always in the same order. When
sorted, however, they&rsquo;re always evaluated in the same
order even if the zone file (or similar) order changes, and
<br>
thus the output is consistent, making it easier for tools
like diff to detect where changes occur in the output. This
comes at a higher CPU cost, as it takes more time to <br>
sort the entries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. Describes which rules are
being loaded and extra detail for rules that found errors
(rule Level and extra text detail)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Even more detail about rules
that found errors: file name, file line number, rule
type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. Shows extra detail on the
record text being analyzed (the detail is not always
available, however).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. Even more detail about rules
that found errors: dumps the rule code itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5. Even more detail about rules
that found errors: dumps the internal rule structure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Obsolete Options <br>
-L Obsolete command line option. Please use --features live
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Run donuts in its default mode on the example.com zone which
is contained in the db.example.com file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% donuts db.example.com
example.com</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Run donuts with significantly
more output, both in terms of verbosity and in terms of the
number of rules that are run to analyze the file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% donuts -v -v --level 9
db.example.com example.com</p>
