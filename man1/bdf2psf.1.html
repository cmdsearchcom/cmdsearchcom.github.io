<p>BDF2PSF(1) Console-setup User&rsquo;s Manual
BDF2PSF(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
bdf2psf - convert a BDF font to PSF format for the Linux
console</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
bdf2psf [--fb] [--log logfile] bdf{+bdf}
equivalence{+equivalence} symbols{+[:]symbols} size psf
[sfm]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The program bdf2psf translates BDF fonts to PSF format. It
accepts fonts with arbitrary size of the font matrix. If the
width of the glyph matrix of the source font is 7 or 9 <br>
pixels then it generates fonts with width of 8 pixels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
--fb Generate font for framebuffer. There are two important
differences between the framebuffer and the text mode.
First, all fonts in text mode have to have matrix 8 pixels
<br>
width. They also have to have either 256 or 512 glyphs.
Second, in most text modes the hardware does some magic in
order to use 8 pixels width fonts as if they were 9
pix&acirc; <br>
els width. In order to achieve this the video hardware
copies the 8th column in the 9th column of the glyphs with
codes from 0xC0 to 0xDF and from 0x1C0 to 0x1DF. Bdf2psf
<br>
is very careful when deciding where to place a particular
glyph and as a result the encoding of the generated font is
more or less arbitrary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--log logfile <br>
Record in the file logfile any problems during the
conversion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bdf{+bdf} <br>
The &quot;+&quot;-separated list of the source BDF font(s).
When a particular symbol is defined in more than one of the
specified fonts then fonts listed first take precedence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">equivalence{+equivalence} <br>
A &quot;+&quot;-separated list of files defining an
equivalence relation between the glyphs. See the section
EQUIVALENCE FILES below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">symbols{+[:]symbols} <br>
A &quot;+&quot;-separated list of files describing character
sets. The generated font will support all specified
character sets. When there is no space in the PSF font for
all <br>
symbols, the character sets listed first take precedence.
When a colon before a character set is specified no warnings
will be issued for symbols that could not be placed <br>
in the font. See the section CHARACTER SETS below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">size The size of the PSF font.
Usually 256 or 512 glyphs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">psf The name of the generated
font. If a file with this name already exists it will be
overwritten.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sfm Save in the file sfm the SFM
of the generated font. This parameter is optional.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CHARACTER SETS <br>
The encodings of the traditional console fonts a similar to
the standard encodings of the different languages. For
example there are fonts for all variants of ISO 8859. This
is <br>
redundant, for example ISO 8859-1, ISO 8859-9 and ISO
8859-15 differ only by few characters and can be easily
covered by only one font.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to determine the
minimal set of character sets a clustering algorithm has
been used. The source code of fontconfig contains lists of
the characters that most languages <br>
require - one list per language. We started with one
character set per language and used the clustering algorithm
in order to join the character sets to bigger. The character
<br>
sets described in files installed in the directory fontsets
were the result of the algorithm. These files list the
unicodes of the symbols of the character set, one per line.
<br>
Comments starting with a sharp sign are also allowed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The files ascii.set, linux.set,
freebsd.set and useful.set contain four special character
sets. The first lists the ASCII symbols and the second and
the third list the symbols <br>
from the so called alternate character set (see section
&quot;Line Graphics&quot; of terminfo(5)) - one for Linux
and one for FreeBSD. Notice that in order to limit itself to
the cp437 <br>
character set, the Linux console driver does some
approximations of the symbols from the alternate character
set. For example it prints U+256A (BOX DRAWINGS VERTICAL
SINGLE AND <br>
HORIZONTAL DOUBLE) instead of the not-equal sign. The file
linux.set lists the symbols used by the Linux console driver
(i.e. U+256A instead of the not-equal sign). The symbols
<br>
from freebsd.set are not fixed by the FreeBSD kernel, but
there too there are some approximations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In most cases there is more
available space in the fonts than necessary. The spare codes
can be filled with the symbols from the useful.set special
character set. It is conve&acirc; <br>
nient to use a colon before the name of useful.set on the
command line of bdf2psf so no warnings are issued when there
is no space in the font for some of these symbols.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EQUIVALENCE FILES <br>
The equivalence files define an equivalence relation between
unicodes. The sharp sign is used for comments, the empty
lines are ignored. All other lines should list two or more
<br>
unicodes. Only one glyph will be allocated in the PSF font
for these unicodes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">U+2126 U+03A9 <br>
# U+2126: OHM SIGN <br>
# U+03A9: GREEK CAPITAL LETTER OMEGA <br>
U+041D U+0048 <br>
# U+041D: CYRILLIC CAPITAL LETTER EN <br>
# U+0048: LATIN CAPITAL LETTER H</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This equivalence file says that
U+2126 (the Ohm sign) and U+03A9 (Omega) have the same look
so only one glyph is enough for them. And also U+041D
(Cyrillic En) and U+0048 (Latin <br>
H) look the same.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Two equivalence files are
provided - standard.equivalents and arabic.equivalents. The
first one can be used for all fonts. The purpose of the
second is to reduce the number of <br>
the necessary glyphs for the Arabic letters at the cost of
the font quality. It should be used only for fonts that have
to support Arabic but there is not enough space in the <br>
PSF font for all Arabic characters. The Uni1 character set
is a character set that requires arabic.equivalents.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
All mentioned files and directories are usually installed in
/usr/share/bdf2psf or /usr/local/share/bdf2psf.</p>
