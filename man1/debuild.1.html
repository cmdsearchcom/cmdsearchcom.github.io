<p>DEBUILD(1) General Commands Manual DEBUILD(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
debuild - build a Debian package</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
debuild [debuild options] [dpkg-buildpackage options]
[--lintian-opts lintian options] <br>
debuild [debuild options]
binary|binary-arch|binary-indep|clean ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
debuild creates all the files necessary for uploading a
Debian package. It first runs dpkg-buildpackage, then runs
lintian on the .changes file created (assuming that lintian
is <br>
installed), and finally signs the .changes and/or .dsc files
as appropriate (using debsign(1) to do this instead of
dpkg-buildpackage(1) itself; all relevant key-signing
options <br>
are passed on). Parameters can be passed to
dpkg-buildpackage and lintian, where the parameters to the
latter are indicated with the --lintian-opts option. The
allowable <br>
options in this case are --lintian and --no-lintian to force
or skip the lintian step, respectively. The default is to
run lintian. There are also various options available for
<br>
setting and preserving environment variables, as described
below in the Environment Variables section. In this method
of running debuild, we also save a build log to the file
<br>
../&lt;package&gt;_&lt;version&gt;_&lt;arch&gt;.build.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An alternative way of using
debuild is to use one or more of the parameters binary,
binary-arch, binary-indep and clean, in which case debuild
will attempt to gain root privi&acirc; <br>
leges and then run debian/rules with the given parameters. A
--rootcmd=gain-root-command or -rgain-root-command option
may be used to specify a method of gaining root privi&acirc;
<br>
leges. The gain-root-command is likely to be one of
fakeroot, sudo or super. See below for further discussion of
this point. Again, the environment preservation options may
be <br>
used. In this case, debuild will also attempt to run
dpkg-checkbuilddeps first; this can be explicitly requested
or switched off using the options -D and -d respectively.
Note <br>
also that if either of these or a -r option is specified in
the configuration file option
DEBUILD_DPKG_BUILDPACKAGE_OPTS, then it will be recognised
even in this method of invo&acirc; <br>
cation of debuild.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">debuild also reads the
devscripts configuration files as described below. This
allows default options to be given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Directory name checking <br>
In common with several other scripts in the devscripts
package, debuild will climb the directory tree until it
finds a debian/changelog file before attempting to build the
pack&acirc; <br>
age. As a safeguard against stray files causing potential
problems, it will examine the name of the parent directory
once it finds the debian/changelog file, and check that the
<br>
directory name corresponds to the package name. Precisely
how it does this is controlled by two configuration file
variables DEVSCRIPTS_CHECK_DIRNAME_LEVEL and <br>
DEVSCRIPTS_CHECK_DIRNAME_REGEX, and their corresponding
command-line options --check-dirname-level and
--check-dirname-regex.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEVSCRIPTS_CHECK_DIRNAME_LEVEL
can take the following values:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 Never check the directory
name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 Only check the directory name
if we have had to change directory in our search for
debian/changelog. This is the default behaviour.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 Always check the directory
name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The directory name is checked by
testing whether the current directory name (as determined by
pwd(1)) matches the regex given by the configuration file
option <br>
DEVSCRIPTS_CHECK_DIRNAME_REGEX or by the command line option
--check-dirname-regex regex. Here regex is a Perl regex (see
perlre(3perl)), which will be anchored at the beginning <br>
and the end. If regex contains a &rsquo;/&rsquo;, then it
must match the full directory path. If not, then it must
match the full directory name. If regex contains the string
&Acirc;&acute;PACKAGE&rsquo;, <br>
this will be replaced by the source package name, as
determined from the changelog. The default value for the
regex is: &Acirc;&acute;PACKAGE(-.+)?&rsquo;, thus matching
directory names such as <br>
PACKAGE and PACKAGE-version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
As environment variables can affect the building of a
package, often unintentionally, debuild sanitises the
environment by removing all environment variables except for
TERM, <br>
HOME, LOGNAME, GNUPGHOME, PGPPATH, GPG_AGENT_INFO,
DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS, FAKEROOTKEY, DEB_*, the (C, CPP,
CXX, LD and F)FLAGS variables and their _APPEND counterparts
and the <br>
locale variables LANG and LC_*. TERM is set to
&lsquo;dumb&rsquo; if it is unset, and PATH is set to
&quot;/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/bin/X11&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a particular environment
variable is required to be passed through untouched to the
build process, this may be specified by using a
--preserve-envvar envvar (which can also be <br>
written as -e envvar option). The environment may be left
untouched by using the --preserve-env option. However, even
in this case, the PATH will be set to the sane value <br>
described above. The only way to prevent PATH from being
reset is to specify a --preserve-envvar PATH option. But you
are warned that using programs from non-standard locations
<br>
can easily result in the package being broken, as it will
not be able to be built on standard systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that one may add
directories to the beginning of the sanitised PATH, using
the --prepend-path option. This is useful when one wishes to
use tools such as ccache or distcc <br>
for building.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is also possible to avoid
having to type something like FOO=bar debuild -e FOO by
writing debuild -e FOO=bar or the long form debuild
--set-envvar FOO=bar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SUPERUSER REQUIREMENTS <br>
debuild needs to be run as superuser to function properly.
There are three fundamentally different ways to do this. The
first, and preferable, method is to use some
root-gain&acirc; <br>
ing command. The best one to use is probably fakeroot(1),
since it does not involve granting any genuine privileges.
super(1) and sudo(1) are also possibilities. If no -r (or
<br>
--rootcmd) option is given (and recall that
dpkg-buildpackage also accepts a -r option) and neither of
the following methods is used, then -rfakeroot will silently
be assumed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The second method is to use some
command such as su(1) to become root, and then to do
everything as root. Note, though, that lintian will abort if
it is run as root or setuid <br>
root; this can be overcome using the --allow-root option of
lintian if you know what you are doing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The third possible method is to
have debuild installed as setuid root. This is not the
default method, and will have to be installed as such by the
system administrator. It <br>
must also be realised that anyone who can run debuild as
root or setuid root has full access to the whole machine.
This method is therefore not recommended, but will work.
<br>
debuild could be installed with mode 4754, so that only
members of the owning group could run it. A disadvantage of
this method would be that other users would then not be able
<br>
to use the program. There are many other variants of this
option involving multiple copies of debuild, or the use of
programs such as sudo or super to grant root privileges to
<br>
users selectively. If the sysadmin wishes to do this, she
should use the dpkg-statoverride program to change the
permissions of /usr/bin/debuild. This will ensure that these
<br>
permissions are preserved across upgrades.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOOKS <br>
debuild supports a number of hooks when running
dpkg-buildpackage. Note that if any of the hooks from
clean-hook to final-clean (inclusive) are used, debuild will
emulate some <br>
sections of the dpkg-buildpackage process rather than
running them directly, as dpkg-buildpackage does not support
hooks. The available hooks are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dpkg-buildpackage-hook <br>
Run before dpkg-buildpackage begins by calling
dpkg-checkbuilddeps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">clean-hook <br>
Run before dpkg-buildpackage runs debian/rules clean to
clean the source tree. (Run even if the tree is not being
cleaned because -nc is used.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dpkg-source-hook <br>
Run after cleaning the tree and before running dpkg-source.
(Run even if dpkg-source is not being called because -b, -B,
or -A is used.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dpkg-build-hook <br>
Run after dpkg-source and before calling debian/rules build.
(Run even if this is a source-only build, so debian/rules
build is not being called.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dpkg-binary-hook <br>
Run between debian/rules build and debian/rules
binary(-arch). Run only if a binary package is being
built.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dpkg-genchanges-hook <br>
Run after the binary package is built and before calling
dpkg-genchanges.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">final-clean-hook <br>
Run after dpkg-genchanges and before the final debian/rules
clean. (Run even if we are not cleaning the tree post-build,
which is the default.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lintian-hook <br>
Run (once) before calling lintian. (Run even if we are not
calling lintian.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">signing-hook <br>
Run after calling lintian before any signing takes place.
(Run even if we are not signing anything.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">post-dpkg-buildpackage-hook <br>
Run after everything has finished.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A hook command can be specified
either in the configuration file as, for example,
DEBUILD_SIGNING_HOOK=&rsquo;foo&rsquo; (note the hyphens
change into underscores!) or as a command line <br>
option --signing-hook-foo. The command will have certain
percent substitutions made on it: %% will be replaced by a
single % sign, %p will be replaced by the package name, %v
by <br>
the package version number, %s by the source version number,
%u by the upstream version number. Neither %s nor %u will
contain an epoch. %a will be 1 if the immediately
follow&acirc; <br>
ing action is to be performed and 0 if not (for example, in
the dpkg-source hook, %a will become 1 if dpkg-source is to
be run and 0 if not). Then it will be handed to the shell
<br>
to deal with, so it can include redirections and stuff. For
example, to only run the dpkg-source hook if dpkg-source is
to be run, the hook could be something like: &quot;if [ %a
-eq <br>
1 ]; then ...; fi&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please take care with hooks, as
misuse of them can lead to packages which FTBFS (fail to
build from source). They can be useful for taking snapshots
of things or the like.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, only
dpkg-buildpackage-hook and the hooks from lintian-hook
onwards can be used if dpkg-cross is installed. (This is
because internally, debuild reimplements <br>
dpkg-buildpackage, but it does not attempt to reimplement
the dpkg-cross replacement of this script.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
For details, see above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-conf, --noconf <br>
Do not read any configuration files. This can only be used
as the first option given on the command-line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--rootcmd=gain-root-command,
-rgain-root-command <br>
Command to gain root (or fake root) privileges.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--preserve-env <br>
Do not clean the environment, except for PATH.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--preserve-envvar=var, -evar
<br>
Do not clean the var variable from the environment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If var ends in an asterisk
(&quot;*&quot;) then all variables with names that match the
portion of var before the asterisk will be preserved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--set-envvar=var=value,
-evar=value <br>
Set the environment variable var to value and do not remove
it from the environment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--prepend-path=value <br>
Once the normalized PATH has been set, prepend value to
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--lintian <br>
Run lintian after dpkg-buildpackage. This is the default
behaviour, and it overrides any configuration file directive
to the contrary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-lintian <br>
Do not run lintian after dpkg-buildpackage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-tgz-check <br>
Even if we&rsquo;re running dpkg-buildpackage and the
version number has a Debian revision, do not check that the
.orig.tar.gz file or .orig directory exists before starting
the <br>
build.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--tgz-check <br>
If we&rsquo;re running dpkg-buildpackage and the version
number has a Debian revision, check that the .orig.tar.gz
file or .orig directory exists before starting the build.
<br>
This is the default behaviour.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--username username <br>
When signing, use debrsign instead of debsign. username
specifies the credentials to be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--foo-hook=hook <br>
Set a hook as described above. If hook is blank, this unsets
the hook.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--clear-hooks <br>
Clears all hooks. They may be reinstated by later command
line options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--check-dirname-level N <br>
See the above section Directory name checking for an
explanation of this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--check-dirname-regex regex <br>
See the above section Directory name checking for an
explanation of this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Do not run
dpkg-checkbuilddeps to check build dependencies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D Run dpkg-checkbuilddeps to
check build dependencies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION VARIABLES <br>
The two configuration files /etc/devscripts.conf and
~/.devscripts are sourced by a shell in that order to set
configuration variables. Command line options can be used to
over&acirc; <br>
ride some of these configuration file settings, otherwise
the --no-conf option can be used to prevent reading these
files. Environment variable settings are ignored when these
<br>
configuration files are read. The currently recognised
variables are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEBUILD_PRESERVE_ENV <br>
If this is set to yes, then it is the same as the
--preserve-env command line parameter being used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEBUILD_PRESERVE_ENVVARS <br>
Which environment variables to preserve. This should be a
comma-separated list of variables. This corresponds to using
possibly multiple --preserve-envvar or -e options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEBUILD_SET_ENVVAR_var=value
<br>
This corresponds to --set-envvar=var=value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEBUILD_PREPEND_PATH <br>
This corresponds to --prepend-path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEBUILD_ROOTCMD <br>
Setting this variable to prog is the equivalent of
-rprog.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEBUILD_TGZ_CHECK <br>
Setting this variable to no is the same as the
--no-tgz-check command line option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEBUILD_SIGNING_USERNAME <br>
Setting this variable is the same as using the --username
command line option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEBUILD_DPKG_BUILDPACKAGE_OPTS
<br>
These are options which should be passed to the invocation
of dpkg-buildpackage. They are given before any command-line
options. Due to issues of shell quoting, if a <br>
word containing spaces is required as a single option, extra
quotes will be required. For example, to ensure that your
own GPG key is always used, even for sponsored <br>
uploads, the configuration file might contain the line:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEBUILD_DPKG_BUILDPACKAGE_OPTS=&quot;-k&rsquo;Julian
Gilbey &lt;jdg@debian.org&gt;&rsquo; -sa&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">which gives precisely two
options. Without the extra single quotes, dpkg-buildpackage
would reasonably complain that Gilbey is an unrecognised
option (it doesn&rsquo;t start <br>
with a - sign).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also, if this option contains
any -r, -d or -D options, these will always be taken account
of by debuild. Note that a -r option in this variable will
override the setting <br>
in DEBUILD_ROOTCMD.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEBUILD_FOO_HOOK <br>
The hook variable for the foo hook. See the section on hooks
above for more details. By default, this is empty.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEBUILD_LINTIAN <br>
Should we run lintian? If this is set to no, then lintian
will not be run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEBUILD_LINTIAN_OPTS <br>
These are options which should be passed to the invocation
of lintian. They are given before any command-line options,
and the usage of this variable is as described for <br>
the DEBUILD_DPKG_BUILDPACKAGE_OPTS variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEVSCRIPTS_CHECK_DIRNAME_LEVEL,
DEVSCRIPTS_CHECK_DIRNAME_REGEX <br>
See the above section Directory name checking for an
explanation of these variables. Note that these are
package-wide configuration variables, and will therefore
affect <br>
all devscripts scripts which check their value, as described
in their respective manpages and in devscripts.conf(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
To build your own package, simply run debuild from inside
the source tree. dpkg-buildpackage(1) options may be given
on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The typical command line options
to build only the binary package(s) without signing the
.changes file (or the non-existent .dsc file):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">debuild -i -us -uc -b</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Change the -b to -S to build
only a source package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An example using lintian to
check the resulting packages and passing options to it:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">debuild --lintian-opts -i</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note the order of options here:
the debuild options come first, then the dpkg-buildpackage
ones, then finally the checker options. (And lintian is
called by default.) If you <br>
find yourself using the same dpkg-buildpackage options
repeatedly, consider using the
DEBUILD_DPKG_BUILDPACKAGE_OPTS configuration file option as
described above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To build a package for a
sponsored upload, given foobar_1.0-1.dsc and the respective
source files, run something like the following commands:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dpkg-source -x foobar_1.0-1.dsc
<br>
cd foobar-1.0 <br>
debuild -k0x12345678</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where 0x12345678 is replaced by
your GPG key ID or other key identifier such as your email
address. Again, you could also use the
DEBUILD_DPKG_BUILDPACKAGE_OPTS configuration <br>
file option as described above to avoid having to type the
-k option each time you do a sponsored upload.</p>
