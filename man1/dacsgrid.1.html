<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This program is part of the DACS suite.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The dacsgrid utility provides
software-based one-time passwords for DACS authentication
using a challenge-response architecture. It administers
accounts that are used by the <br>
local_grid_authenticate[2] authentication module. These
accounts are completely separate from the accounts used by
local_passwd_authenticate[3] or any other DACS
authentication <br>
module.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dacsgrid generates a rectangular
grid of cells. Each cell consists of a letter, followed by a
digit, followed by a letter, yielding 6,760 (26*10*26)
possible three-character-long <br>
strings. The contents of each cell are generated from
cryptographically-strong pseudo-random bytes. The maximum
grid size is 99 rows by 26 columns, and the minimum grid
size is 3 <br>
by 3. The columns are labelled A through Z and the rows are
labelled 1 through 99. For recommended grid sizes, it is
highly likely that each grid that is generated is unique and
<br>
therefore that each user will be assigned a different
grid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here is a 10x10 grid (the
default size):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A B C D E F G H I J <br>
1 x7m p7m k4c q9s q2k d9l s5m r8c y3v g2m <br>

Created: Mon Aug 14 10:25:03 2006 PDT</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A cell is identified by its
column label (a letter) followed by its row label (a
number); e.g., in the example above, cell F6 has the value
b8k.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each grid is assigned a random
(and presumably unique) identification string (labelled
&quot;Serial&quot; in the example above); this string is
stored on the server with other grid account <br>
data. It can be displayed by a jurisdiction at login time as
a way of authenticating itself to a user, provided it is
kept confidential (one approach might be for each of the
<br>
parties to supply a different half of the identification
string to the other).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At authentication time, the user
is presented with a randomly-generated challenge that is
appropriate for the user&rsquo;s grid. The challenge is
displayed to the user; e.g., &quot;A3, C9, <br>
B1, F9&quot;. The grid&rsquo;s serial number, or a portion
of it, might also be displayed. The user must consult his
grid to locate each of the cells for the given challenge and
enter their <br>
contents as the password. Letters are case insensitive,
blanks, tabs, and commas are ignored. For the grid and
challenge above, the user would enter the following
characters as <br>
the password:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">v8ni7cp7mc4h</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that a challenge may ask
for the same cell more than once.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A challenge is valid for a
configurable length of time after which it can no longer be
used for authentication; see
AUTH_GRID_CHALLENGE_SECS[4].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To judge how long a challenge
should be, assume that user-selected passwords are chosen
randomly and uniformly from approximately 100 characters
available on a keyboard. This is <br>
a very generous assumption that is seldom realized in
practice. A grid challenge of four cells is much stronger
than a user-selected password of six characters (69604 vs.
1006) <br>
and a grid challenge of five cells is much stronger than a
user-selected password of nine characters (69605 vs. 1009).
When compared to typical user passwords, however, a grid
<br>
challenge of three cells is probably about as strong as a
user-chosen password of seven or eight characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Grids are accessed through
DACS&rsquo;s virtual filestore using item type auth_grid. It
is assumed that file permissions on the database of grids
are such that all access is limited to <br>
the administrator and local_grid_authenticate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After a run-time configurable
period, a grid expires and will not be accepted for
authentication purposes by local_grid_authenticate (see
AUTH_GRID_LIFETIME_SECS[5]) or dacsgrid <br>
(see -lifetime). The validity period of a grid might be
based on several factors, such as how often it is used at a
jurisdiction, the number of cells in the grid, the degree of
<br>
security required, or how difficult or expensive it is to
distribute a grid to its user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At the time a grid is generated,
dacsgrid can associate a randomly chosen PIN with it. A PIN,
which acts as a secondary password, consists of a sequence
of letter-digit-letter <br>
cells. The default PIN length of two cells (6 characters)
can be overridden on the command line. If a user has been
provided with a PIN, it should be entered at the start of
the <br>
user&rsquo;s response to the challenge, immediately before
the contents of the first cell of the challenge are
entered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Security <br>
When used properly, this authentication method can be
comparatively secure. The main challenge is that it is
essential that grids and PINs are distributed to users via a
<br>
sufficiently secure method; e.g., by printing them and
mailing a hardcopy directly to the user, or by using
existing secure channels. Each user must understand that a
grid is <br>
essentially a list of passwords and, accordingly, must be
kept secret during its validity period. When PINs are used,
they must be distributed using a secure channel <br>
different from the one used to distribute grids. How this
distribution is done is left to the DACS administrator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Information is encrypted before
being written to the grid account file. By default, the
virtual filestore item type auth_grid_keys identifies the
encryption keys to use; the <br>
-inkeys and -outkeys flags specify alternatives (see
dacskey(1)[6]). File permissions must be set so that the
encryption keys are readable only by dacsgrid. If the
encryption <br>
keys are lost, the account entries are practically
unrecoverable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Only the DACS administrator
should be able to successfully run this program from the
command line. Because DACS keys and configuration files,
including the file used to store <br>
accounts, must be restricted to the administrator, this will
normally be the case, but a careful administrator will set
file permissions to deny access to all other users.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This authentication method has
the following advantages:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Each time a user
authenticates, a different password will be requested (with
high probability)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The password
that is required is not known prior to authentication, so a
user cannot tell someone else what his password is other
than by sharing the entire grid (and the <br>
PIN, if any)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Because the
password is unlikely to be an easily-guessed word or phrase,
it should be stronger than a user-selected password</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Should a key
sniffer be installed on the user&rsquo;s computer, a sniffed
password does not do an attacker any good, since it is
highly unlikely to be reused. If the corresponding <br>
challenge can also be obtained by an attacker, such as
through a phishing attack, a portion of the grid will be
revealed</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The length of
the challenge (which determines the length of the password)
is configurable by the administrator and can be changed at
will</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A user&rsquo;s
grid can easily be changed by an administrator as often as
practical</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The method is
cheaper than hardware-based one-time passwords, provided
distribution costs are low</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This authentication method has
the following potential disadvantages:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The
authentication method is inherently interactive in that the
password is not known a priori, although this does not
guarantee that the user is physically present</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Secure channels
are needed to distribute grids and PINs</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; An
authentication grid can be easily copied and so it is best
used in conjunction with PINs or at least one other
authentication method; the challenge of keeping grids secret
<br>
in all situations is the main reason why the method is not
as strong as hardware token-based methods, which are more
difficult to copy and can be protected by a PIN. The <br>
method is best employed in situations where a grid is not
likely to be stolen, easily copied, or even recognized, such
as for remote access.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This authentication method falls
somewhere between the &quot;something you know&quot; form
and the &quot;something you have&quot; form. One might be
able to memorize a smaller grid, putting it into <br>
the former category, but few are capable of memorizing a
large grid, which makes it necessary to have a copy in
one&rsquo;s possession. Using PINs provides something closer
to <br>
two-factor authentication and strengthens the method since a
captured grid is not directly usable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note <br>
It is possible for different users to be assigned grids of
different sizes. To prevent generation of a challenge that
is impossible to satisfy, when the challenge is <br>
requested either the corresponding grid must be of the
default size, the dimensions of the grid must be specified,
or the username must be specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
In addition to the standard dacsoptions[1], the following
command line flags are recognized:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-challenge <br>
Emit a random challenge. If username was specified, a
size-appropriate challenge will be produced; otherwise, if
grid dimensions have been specified, a suitable challenge
<br>
will be produced; otherwise, the default grid dimensions
will be used when producing a challenge.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-clen num <br>
Set the challenge length to num cells. The minimum length is
3 cells and the default length is 4 cells.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-copy vfs_uri <br>
Copy the input grids to the grids specified by vfs_uri,
deleting any existing contents.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dec token <br>
Decrypt a challenge token produced by the -enc option and
print it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-delete <br>
Delete the account for username.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-disable <br>
Disable logins for username. Implies -set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-enable <br>
Enable logins for username. Implies -set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-enc challenge <br>
Encrypt a challenge (typically, produced by the -challenge
option) and print it. The item type federation_keys is used
for this purpose, which means that any jurisdiction in <br>
the federation can decrypt the challenge.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-expired <br>
List only expired grids, relative to the grid lifetime in
effect. Implies -list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-flat <br>
Print a grid in a concise textual representation that
consists of three comma-separated fields: the serial number,
enabled/disabled flag (non-zero means enabled), the grid
<br>
(as an ordered sequence of space-separated rows), a PIN (or
zero if there is no PIN), and the creation date (as the
number of seconds since the epoch).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-get <br>
Retrieve the grid for username and make it the
&quot;current&quot; grid for display purposes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-grid str <br>
Make str, a grid in the flattened representation, the
&quot;current&quot; grid for display purposes or the -set
flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h <br>
-help <br>
Display a help message and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-html <br>
Emit a grid as a fragment of an HTML document.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-htmlcss <br>
Emit a grid as a fragment of an HTML document with some
CSS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-inkeys item_type <br>
For decrypting account information, use the store identified
by item_type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-lifetime ndays <br>
Consider the lifetime of grids to be ndays days. Grids do
not have a fixed lifetime; only their date of creation is
recorded. The default lifetime is 7 days.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-list <br>
List username, if given, otherwise all usernames.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-long <br>
Produce more detailed listing output. Implies -list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ncols num <br>
Set the number of grid columns to num, which is between 3
and 26. This is used when generating grids and
challenges.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nrows num <br>
Set the number of grid rows to num, which is between 3 and
99. This is used when generating grids and challenges.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-outkeys item_type <br>
For encrypting account information, use the store identified
by item_type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pin[num] <br>
If no other operation is specified, print the PIN, if any,
for username. With the -set flag, generate a new PIN for
username. If a non-negative integer is appended to the <br>
flag (e.g., -pin0, -pin4), the PIN length (in cell units) is
set to that number with respect to PIN generation. The
default PIN length is 2 cells. Setting the PIN length to
<br>
zero turns off PIN generation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-refresh <br>
If a username is given, generate a new grid for that user.
If no username is given, generate a new grid for each user
that already has a grid. Any existing grid immediately <br>
becomes invalid. All of these grids will have the same
dimensions. If the -grid flag is given, it is ignored. By
default, any existing PIN is retained. The old grid&rsquo;s
<br>
enabled/disabled status is retained. If the -pin flag is
given, a new PIN will be generated; if -pin0 is given,
however, new grids will not have a PIN.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-rnd <br>
Reserved for future use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-seed str <br>
Reserved for future use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-serial <br>
Print the serial number of the current grid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-set <br>
Set or replace the grid for username.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-size <br>
Display the grid dimensions in terms of the command line
flags -ncols and -nrows. Implies -list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-test <br>
Emit a grid and a challenge, prompt from a response, and
verify the response.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-text <br>
Emit a pretty-printed grid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-validate challenge response
<br>
Validate response against challenge.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-vfs vfs_uri <br>
Instead of using the item type auth_grid to specify which
grids to act on, use vfs_uri (see the VFS[7] configuration
directive).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default action is to display
the current grid. Apart from error messages, which are
printed to the standard error, all output goes to the
standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ordinarily, a dacsoption will be
specified to select the jurisdiction on behalf of which
grids are being created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
These examples assume that the jurisdiction name to use is
EXAMPLE and its domain is example.com.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To use this authentication
method, a DACS administrator would perform the following
steps:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; After reviewing
the way the method operates, decide how grids will be
securely distributed to users, select the grid parameters,
decide whether PINs will be used and how they <br>
will be securely distributed, and determine a schedule for
refreshing grids (and perhaps PINs).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Decide where the
grids will be stored and add a suitable VFS directive to
dacs.conf, for example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VFS
&quot;[auth_grid]dacs-kwv-fs:${Conf::FEDERATIONS_ROOT}/
${Conf::FEDERATION_DOMAIN}/${Conf::JURISDICTION_NAME}/grids&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Generate keys,
decide where they will be stored, and add a suitable VFS
directive to dacs.conf, for example (your user ID, groupID,
and path may vary):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% cd
/usr/local/dacs/federations_root/example.com/EXAMPLE <br>
% dacskey -uj EXAMPLE -q auth_grid_keys <br>
% chgrp www auth_grid_keys <br>
% chmod 0640 auth_grid_keys</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VFS
&quot;[auth_grid_keys]dacs-fs:${Conf::FEDERATIONS_ROOT}/
${Conf::FEDERATION_DOMAIN}/${Conf::JURISDICTION_NAME}/auth_grid_keys&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Configure a
suitable Auth clause in dacs.conf, for example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;Auth id=&quot;grid&quot;&gt;
<br>
URL
&quot;https://example.com/cgi-bin/dacs/local_grid_authenticate&quot;
<br>
STYLE &quot;pass&quot; <br>
CONTROL &quot;sufficient&quot; <br>
&lt;/Auth&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; For each user
that will be capable of authenticating using this method: a)
generate a grid of the necessary dimensions, with or without
a PIN (as required); b) obtain the <br>
grid in the most suitable format and give it to its owner;
and c) if there is a PIN, obtain the PIN and give it to its
owner.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Refresh the grid
(and, optionally, the PIN) as scheduled and give the user
the replacement grid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To create and display a grid
(but not create an account):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% dacsgrid -uj EXAMPLE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To generate a grid of default
dimensions and assign it to username bobo (replacing any
existing grid for that user):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% dacsgrid -uj EXAMPLE -set
bobo</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To generate a 6x6 grid and
assign it to username bobo (replacing any existing
grid):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% dacsgrid -uj EXAMPLE -nrows 6
-ncols 6 -set bobo</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To retrieve and print a grid (as
HTML) for the username bobo:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% dacsgrid -uj EXAMPLE -get
-html bobo</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To display the PIN for username
bobo:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% dacsgrid -uj EXAMPLE -pin
bobo</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The exit status will be non-zero
if this user does not have a grid or if the grid does not
have a PIN.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To copy the current set of grids
to the file /secure/grids:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% dacsgrid -uj EXAMPLE -copy
&quot;dacs-kwv-fs:/secure/grids&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To refresh an alternate set of
grids in the file /secure/grids:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% dacsgrid -uj EXAMPLE -copy
&quot;dacs-kwv-fs:/secure/grids&quot; <br>
% dacsgrid -uj EXAMPLE -vfs
&quot;dacs-kwv-fs:/secure/grids&quot; -refresh</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An example shell script that
generates a minimal HTML login page for grid authentication
is included in the distribution. It assumes that all grids
are the default size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If different users may have
grids of different sizes, or if a jurisdiction wants to
display a user&rsquo;s grid&rsquo;s serial number as a form
of jurisdictional authentication, then the <br>
login procedure must determine the username before it can
acquire a challenge or serial number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
dacs_grid.css[8]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
The program exits 0, or 1 if an error occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
To help thwart automated responses, should some assurance be
required that a person rather than software is answering a
challenge, the challenge might be presented as a <br>
CAPTCHA[9] or something similar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A hardware device could be used
to store and access grids, which could boost the
method&rsquo;s security and possibly even offer advantages
over the PRNG methods used by most <br>
commercial tokens.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another idea is to supply users
with software to run on their personal workstations that
would securely store and manage grids and, given a
challenge, display the response. This <br>
may not provide the same level of confidence as hardware
token or hard-copy based methods, however, because it is
difficult to be certain that a computer, file, or program
hasn&rsquo;t <br>
been compromised. If sufficiently secure, a
password-protected USB flash memory device might be
acceptable for transporting and storing grids.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The login interface should
consider providing a menu or image map to enter the PIN,
rather than the keyboard, to defeat keylogging spyware.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using this authentication method
makes you feel like you are a secret agent. Consider
printing grids on an edible substrate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
There should be a clean way of flipping from one set of
grids to another at a specified date and time. This can
currently be done by pre-generating a set of grids with <br>
appropriate file names (e.g., based on the date the set
becomes effective) and configuring the VFS directive for the
grids to form the file name based on the current date.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Users cannot select their own
PINs. This may be a feature.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An alternate mode of operation
based on strong but repeatable pseudo random numbers
described by NIST SP 800-90[10] is pending. The current
implementation does not employ a <br>
reproducible sequence of pseudo random numbers; this has
advantages and disadvantages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The account file should probably
be an XML document.</p>
