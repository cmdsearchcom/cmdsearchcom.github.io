<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This program is part of Netpbm(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pnmcolormap reads a PNM or PAM
image as input, chooses ncolors colors to best represent the
image and writes a PNM color map defining them as output. A
PAM image may actually <br>
contain tuples of any kind, but pnmcolormap&rsquo;s concept
of the tuple values that best represent the ones present in
the image may not make sense if the tuple type isn&rsquo;t
RGB or <br>
GRAYSCALE. The design of the program, and the rest of this
manual, assumes the tuples represent colors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can use this map as input to
pnmremap on the same input image to quantize the colors in
that image, I.e. produce a similar image with fewer colors.
pnmquant does both the <br>
pnmcolormap and pnmremap steps for you.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A PNM colormap is a PNM image of
any dimensions that contains at least one pixel of each
color in the set of colors it represents. The ones
pnmcolormap generates have exactly <br>
one pixel of each color, except where padding is necessary
with the -square option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The quantization method is
Heckbert&rsquo;s &rsquo;median cut&rsquo;. See QUANTIZATION
METHOD &acirc;&uml;#quant&acirc;&copy; .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The output image is of the same
format (PBM, PGM, PPM, PAM) as the input image. Note that a
colormap of a PBM image is not very interesting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The colormap generally has the
same maxval as the input image, but pnmcolormap may reduce
it if there are too many colors in the input, as part of its
quantization algorithm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pnmcolormap works on a
multi-image input stream. In that case, it produces one
colormap that applies to all of the colors in all of the
input images. All the images must have <br>
the same format, depth, and maxval (but may have different
height and width). This is useful if you need to quantize a
bunch of images that will form a movie or otherwise be <br>
used together -- you generally want them all to draw from
the same palette, whereas computing a colormap separately
from each image would make the same color in two images map
to <br>
different colors. Before Netpbm 10.31 (December 2005),
pnmcolormap ignored any image after the first.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to create a colormap
without basing it on the colors in an input image, pamseq,
ppmmake, and pnmcat can be useful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PARAMETERS <br>
The single parameter, which is required, is the number of
colors you want in the output colormap. pnmcolormap may
produce a color map with slightly fewer colors than that.
You <br>
may specify all to get a colormap of every color in the
input image (no quantization).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
All options can be abbreviated to their shortest unique
prefix. You may use two hyphens instead of one to designate
an option. You may use either white space or an equals sign
<br>
between an option name and its value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sort This option causes the
output colormap to be sorted by the red component intensity,
then the green, then the blue in ascending order. This is an
insertion sort, so it is <br>
not very fast on large colormaps. Sorting is useful because
it allows you to compare two sets of colors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-square <br>
By default, pnmcolormap produces as the color map a PPM
image with one row and with one column for each color in the
colormap. This option causes pnmcolormap instead to <br>
produce a PPM image that is within one row or column of
being square, with the last pixel duplicated as necessary to
create a number of pixels which is such an almost-per&acirc;
<br>
fect square.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-verbose <br>
This option causes pnmcolormap to display messages to
Standard Error about the quantization..TP -center</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-meancolor</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-meanpixel</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-spreadbrightness</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-spreadluminosity <br>
These options control the quantization algorithm. See
QUANTIZATION METHOD &acirc;&uml;#quant&acirc;&copy; .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">QUANTIZATION METHOD <br>
A quantization method is a way to choose which colors, being
fewer in number than in the input, you want in the output.
pnmcolormap uses Heckbert&rsquo;s &rsquo;median cut&rsquo;
quantization <br>
method.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This method involves separating
all the colors into &rsquo;boxes,&rsquo; each holding colors
that represent about the same number of pixels. You start
with one box and split boxes in two <br>
until the number of boxes is the same as the number of
colors you want in the output, and choose one color to
represent each box.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When you split a box, you do it
so that all the colors in one sub-box are
&rsquo;greater&rsquo; than all the colors in the other.
&rsquo;Greater,&rsquo; for a particular box, means it is
brighter in <br>
the color component (red, green, blue) which has the largest
spread in that box. pnmcolormap gives you two ways to define
&rsquo;largest spread.&rsquo;: 1) largest spread of
brightness; 2) <br>
largest spread of contribution to the luminosity of the
color. E.g. red is weighted much more than blue. Select
among these with the -spreadbrightness and -spreadluminosity
<br>
options. The default is -spreadbrightness.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pnmcolormap provides three ways
of choosing a color to represent a box: 1) the center color
- the color halfway between the greatest and least colors in
the box, using the above <br>
definition of &rsquo;greater&rsquo;; 2) the mean of the
colors (each component averaged separately by brightness) in
the box; 3) the mean weighted by the number of pixels of a
color in the <br>
image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that in all three methods,
there may be colors in the output which do not appear in the
input at all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Select among these with the
-center, -meancolor, and -meanpixel options. The default is
-center.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY <br>
Before Netpbm 10.15 (April 2003), pnmcolormap used a lot
more memory for large images because it kept the entire
input image in memory. Now, it processes it a row at a time,
but <br>
because it sometimes must make multiple passes through the
image, it first copies the input into a temporary seekable
file if it is not already in a seekable file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pnmcolormap first appeared in
Netpbm 9.23 (January 2002). Before that, its function was
available only as part of the function of pnmquant (which
was derived from the much older <br>
ppmquant). Color quantization really has two main
subfunctions, so Netpbm 9.23 split it out into two separate
programs: pnmcolormap and pnmremap and then Netpbm 9.24
replaced <br>
pnmquant with a program that simply calls pnmcolormap and
pnmremap.</p>
