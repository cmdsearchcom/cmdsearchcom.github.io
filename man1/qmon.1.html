<p>QMON(1) Grid Engine User Commands QMON(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
qmon - X-Windows OSF/Motif graphical user interface for Grid
Engine</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNTAX <br>
qmon [options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Qmon allows administrators and users to manipulate the Grid
Engine system from an X-Window environment. Qmon provides
various dialogues linked together in multiple ways. For <br>
each task the user wishes to accomplish via qmon a
corresponding dialogue is provided. There are multiple ways
to address the proper dialogue for a certain task:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The qmon main
window that comes up first on start-up contains icon buttons
for all major administrative and user tasks. A functionality
tooltip is displayed when pointing at <br>
the different icons.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A Task pulldown
menu button appears in the qmon main window menu bar.
Clicking on it opens a list of available tasks. Selecting
one of them opens the corresponding dialogue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The Task
pulldown menu also contains the key accelerators which can
be used to invoke the task dialogues directly from the main
window by pressing a certain sequence on the <br>
keyboard.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; While navigating
through a certain dialogue and its dialogue sub-hierarchy,
links to other dialogues occur whenever a connection between
both dialogues is obvious. Pushing the <br>
buttons that identify the links opens up the other
dialogues.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The supported options are the standard X Toolkit options as
described in X(1) section Options. Furthermore, qmon
supports:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-cmap Installs a private color
map for qmon. This is sometimes useful if other applications
have already allocated lots of colors and if qmon, therefore
prints corresponding <br>
error messages. Note, however, that using a private color
map will result in color map switches whenever you enter or
leave qmon windows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fontFamily {big|medium|small}
<br>
Notifies qmon to use different size font families for
different resolution sizes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-help Displays usage
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nologo <br>
Startup without logo.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIALOGUES <br>
Job Control <br>
The Job Control dialogue provides a folder of tabulated
lists of the still pending jobs, already running jobs and
recently finished jobs. The dialogue allows for detailed
infor&acirc; <br>
mation on the jobs as well as for the deletion and
suspension of jobs being selected. In addition the job
control dialogue offers links to the Submit dialogue in
order to submit <br>
new jobs or to change attributes of pending jobs (Qalter
button). The fields displayed in the tabular display and the
jobs displayed can be customized by pressing the Customize
<br>
button. This customization can be saved to the
~/.qmon_preferences file and is used on following startup
for the initial configuration of the Job Control
dialogue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Queue Control <br>
The Queue Control dialogue with its sub-dialogue hierarchy
enables the user to control the status of the Grid Engine
queues actually configured in the system and allows the <br>
administrator to add new queues or to modify or delete
existing ones. The Queue Control dialogue shows a tabbed
view of Cluster Queues or their corresponding Queue
Instances in a <br>
tabular way.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By pushing the Add, Clone or
Modify button, a sub-dialogue for configuring Grid Engine
queues is opened. A queue needs to be selected to use the
clone and modify operation. The <br>
configuration sub-dialogue allows for definition of the
queue and its attributes. The configuration sub-dialogue
contains in the upper section the queue name and a list of
hosts <br>
or hostgroups for which this queue contains the
configuration. The lower section contains a list of hosts or
hostgroups at the left, where the default attributes are
shown when <br>
the &quot;@/&quot; entry is highlighted. These default
attributes can be overruled on a hostgroup or host basis by
enabling attributes and changing their values after this
hostgroup or <br>
host entry has been added in the &quot;Attributes for
Host/Hostgroup&quot; listbox. The queue configuration
parameters (see queue_conf(5)) are subdivided into different
categories (Gen&acirc; <br>
eral Configuration, Execution Methods, Checkpointing,
Load/Suspend Thresholds, Limits, Complexes, User Access,
Project Access, Subordinate Queues, Owners) which are
selectable by <br>
the tab widget area presented in the lower region of the
queue configuration sub-dialogue. The administrator may
select previously-configured settings from already existing
<br>
queues (Clone button). By pushing the Ok button, the
definitions are registered with sge_qmaster(8). The Queue
Control dialogue can be customized in a similar way as the
Job <br>
Control dialogue. The settings applied here are also saved
in ~/.qmon_preferences.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Submit <br>
The Job Submission dialogue serves for submitting batch and
interactive jobs and is also invoked when changing
attributes of pending jobs from the Job Control dialogue
explained <br>
above (Qalter button). To toggle between batch and
interactive jobs please use the Batch/Interactive button at
the top of the button column on the right side of the Job
Submis&acirc; <br>
sion screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The dialogue consists of a
folder containing two job preparation dialogue pages. The
most frequently used parameters in the course of a job
submission are offered on the General <br>
page. A job script has to be defined; all other fields are
optional. If the job demands specification of advanced
requirements, the Advanced tab can be used to switch to an
<br>
enhanced parameter display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If resource requirements are
mandatory for the job, the Request Resources icon button has
to be used to pop up the Requested Resources sub-dialogue.
This sub-dialogue allows for <br>
selection of the required resources of the job and for
definition of the quantities in which this resources are to
be provided. The Available Resources are constituted from
those <br>
complex attributes declared requestable (see complex(5) for
details). Resource requirements can be made Hard, i.e. they
must be met before a job can be started in a queue, or <br>
Soft, i.e. they are granted on an as-available basis.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Closing the Requested Resources
sub-dialogue with the done button books the specified
requirement for the job. Pushing the Submit button on the
top level Submit dialogue submits <br>
the job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Complex Config <br>
The Complex Config allows the administrator to add new
complex attributes or to modify or delete existing ones (see
complex(5)). The complex configuration dialogue provides a
<br>
tabulated list of the complex attribute entries and an input
region for the declaration of new or modified entries. The
Add button updates the tabulated list with a new <br>
attribute. The Modify button changes a highlighted existing
entry. The Delete button removes the highlighted attributes.
The Load and Save buttons allow saving or reloading <br>
the whole attribute list to or from file. The Ok button
registers the additional or modified complex attributes with
sge_qmaster(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Host Config <br>
Four types of host related lists can be maintained via the
Host Config dialogue:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Administration Hosts <br>
Submit Hosts <br>
Host Groups <br>
Execution Hosts</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The host list to be manipulated
is selected via clicking at one of the tabs named
correspondingly. The first two host lists only provide for
adding or deleting entries, thereby <br>
allowing administrative or submit permission for the hosts
on the lists, or denying it otherwise respectively. The host
group list allows the manipulation of host groups. Host <br>
groups can reference either other host groups or hosts. The
execution host list entries in addition provide the ability
to define scaling factors for the load sensors,
consum&acirc; <br>
able complex attributes and access attributes (access,
xaccess and projects, xprojects) as described in complex(5).
CPU, memory and I/O usage reported for running jobs can be
<br>
scaled in addition and the relative performance of a host
can be defined with the Resource Capability Factor (see
host_conf(5)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cluster Config <br>
This dialogue maintains the cluster global configuration as
well as host specific derivatives (see sge_conf(5)). When
opened, the dialogue displays a selection list for all <br>
hosts which have a configuration assigned. The special name
&quot;global&quot; refers to the cluster global
configuration. By pushing the Add/Modify button a
sub-dialogue is opened, which <br>
allows for modification of the cluster configuration. For
host specific configurations the &rsquo;global&rsquo; host
specific configuration fields are set insensitive and only
the allowed <br>
parameters can be manipulated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Scheduler Config <br>
The Scheduler Configuration dialogue provides the means to
change the behavior of the Grid Engine scheduler thread part
of sge_qmaster(8) process. The dialogue contains a
repre&acirc; <br>
sentation for all scheduler configuration parameters as
described in sched_conf(5). It is subdivided in the two
sections General Parameters and Load Adjustments, which can
be <br>
selected via the corresponding tabs. The Ok button registers
any changes with sge_qmaster(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Calendar Config <br>
The Calendar Config allows the administrator to add new
calendars or to modify or delete existing ones (see
calendar_conf(5)). The dialogue offers a selection list for
the <br>
existing calendars and displays the configuration of the one
being selected. By pushing the Delete button, the selected
calendar is deleted from the configuration. Pushing the <br>
Add/Modify button will open a calendar configuration
dialogue, which allows to create new calendars or which
provides the means to change the existing ones. The Ok
button regis&acirc; <br>
ters the additional or modified calendar with
sge_qmaster(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">User Config <br>
User permissions are controlled via the User Config
dialogue. The tab widget in the left section of the dialogue
allows for selecting between</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Configuration of Manager
accounts. <br>
Configuration of Operator accounts. <br>
Definition of Usersets. <br>
Definition of User accounts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Those user accounts added to the
list of manager or operator accounts are given permission to
act as managers or operators respectively when accessing
Grid Engine under their own <br>
account.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The userset lists are used
together with the user_lists and xuser_lists host, queue,
project and cluster configuration parameters (see
queue_conf(5), project(5) and sge_conf(5)) <br>
to control access of users to hosts, queues, projects and
the entire cluster. A userset is just a collection of user
names and UNIX group names. Group names are identified by
<br>
prefixing them with a &quot;@&quot; sign. The
already-defined usersets are displayed in a selection list.
These lists can be modified, and new lists can be created,
using the Userset defi&acirc; <br>
nition dialogue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Usersets can be used as Access
List and/or as Department required for the so called
Functional Policy and Override Policy (see Ticket Config
below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">User names can be added to the
system as entries to the Grid Engine user database (see
user(5)); here a default project can be attached to the user
too. This can be done with <br>
the User sub-dialogue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Tickets button in the button
list on the right side of the dialogue opens the Ticket
Config dialogue (see below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PE Config <br>
Parallel environment (PE) interfaces can be configured with
this dialogue. PE interfaces are necessary to describe how
parallel programming environments like PVM (Parallel
Vir&acirc; <br>
tual Machine), MPI (Message Passing Interface), or shared
memory parallel systems, are to be instantiated and to
impose access restrictions onto the PEs. When the dialogue
is <br>
opened a list of the configured PEs is displayed, together
with the current configuration (see sge_pe(5)) of the
selected PE interface. To add new PE interfaces, or to
modify <br>
existing ones, an Add and a Modify button are available
which open a PE interface configuration sub-dialogue. After
applying the changes and quitting this sub-dialogue with the
<br>
OK button, the new or modified PE interface is registered
with sge_qmaster(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Checkpoint Config <br>
Checkpointing environment interfaces can be configured with
this dialogue. Checkpointing environments are necessary to
describe the attributes which the different checkpointing
<br>
methods and their derivatives on various operating system
platforms supported by Grid Engine have. When the dialogue
is opened a list of the already configured checkpointing
<br>
environments is displayed together with the current
configuration (see checkpoint(5)) of the selected
checkpointing environment. To add new checkpointing
environments, or to mod&acirc; <br>
ify existing ones, an Add and a Modify button is available
which opens a checkpointing environment configuration
sub-dialogue. After applying the changes and quitting this
sub- <br>
dialogue with the OK button, the new or modified
checkpointing environment is registered with
sge_qmaster(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ticket Conf <br>
This dialogue offers an overview and editing screen for
allocating tickets to the share-based, functional and
override scheduling policies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Deadline Job button opens
the User Conf dialogue box. Please change to the Userset
sub-dialogue and select the userset named
&quot;deadlineusers&quot;. Only users of this userset may
<br>
submit deadline jobs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Share Tree Policy button
opens the dialogue for creating and editing the Grid Engine
share tree (see share_tree(5) and sched_conf(5) for a
description of the configuration <br>
parameters).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Functional Policy button
opens the dialogue for creating and editing the allocation
of the functional shares (see sched_conf(5), access_list(5),
project(5), queue_conf(5) and <br>
user(5) for a description of the different types of
functional shares and the configurable weighting
parameters).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Override Policy button opens
the dialogue for creating and editing the allocation of
override tickets (see access_list(5), project(5),
queue_conf(5) and user(5) for a <br>
description of the different types of override tickets).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Project Conf <br>
This button opens a dialog for creating projects. <br>
The dialogue offers a selection list for the existing
projects and displays the configuration of the one being
selected. By pushing the Delete button, the selected project
is <br>
deleted from the configuration. Pushing the Add/Modify
button will open a project configuration dialogue, which
allows creating new projects changing existing ones. Project
con&acirc; <br>
figuration in essence means giving or denying access to a
project for usersets (see User Conf above as well as
project(5)). The Ok button registers the additional or
modified <br>
project with sge_qmaster(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Browser <br>
The Object Browser dialogue&rsquo;s purpose is manifold:
First of all, Grid Engine and qmon Messages, such as
notification of error or success concerning a previously
taken action, can <br>
be displayed in the dialogue&rsquo;s output window. Also the
standard output and the standard error output of qmon can be
diverted to the Object Browser output window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Additionally the Object Browser
can be used to display continuous information about Grid
Engine objects as the mouse pointer moves over their
representation as icons or table <br>
entries in other qmon dialogues. Currently, only the display
of the configuration of two Grid Engine objects in two
separate dialogues is supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Queue
configurations are displayed as soon as the mouse pointer
enters a queue icon in the top level Queue Control dialogue
(see above). This facility is activated by pushing <br>
the Queue button in the Object Browser dialogue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Detailed job
information is printed as soon as the user moves the mouse
pointer over a line in the Job Control dialogue (see above)
assigned to a running or pending job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Additionally job
scheduling information is displayed in the browser if the
Why? button in the Job Control dialogue is pressed. In this
case the Browser dialogue is opened <br>
implicitly and any scheduling related information is
displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Exit <br>
The Exit icon button is not linked with a dialogue. Its sole
purpose is to close all active qmon dialogues and to exit
the application.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RESOURCES <br>
The available resources, their meaning and the syntax to be
followed in order to modify them are described in the
default qmon resource file (see the section Files below for
the <br>
location of the resource file).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
SGE_ROOT Specifies the location of the Grid Engine standard
configuration files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SGE_CELL If set, specifies the
default Grid Engine cell. To address a Grid Engine cell qmon
uses (in the order of precedence):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The name of the cell specified
in the environment variable SGE_CELL, if it is set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The name of the default cell,
i.e. default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SGE_DEBUG_LEVEL <br>
If set, specifies that debug information should be written
to stderr. In addition the level of detail in which debug
information is generated is defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SGE_QMASTER_PORT <br>
If set, specifies the tcp port on which sge_qmaster(8) is
expected to listen for communication requests. Most
installations will use a services map entry instead <br>
to define that port.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SGE_LOAD_AVG Specify a load
parameter (see load_parameters(5)) to use instead of
load_avg when displaying/selecting load values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RESTRICTIONS <br>
If the line to be entered in an editing window is longer
than the width of the window, then the text just runs off
the end of the window.</p>
