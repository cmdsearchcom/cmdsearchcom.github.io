<i>Qmon</i> allows administrators and users to manipulate the Grid Engine system
  from an X-Window environment. <i>Qmon</i> provides various dialogues linked
  together in multiple ways. For each task the user wishes to accomplish via
  <i>qmon</i> a corresponding dialogue is provided. There are multiple ways to
  address the proper dialogue for a certain task:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The <i>qmon</i> main window that comes up first on start-up
      contains icon buttons for all major administrative and user tasks. A
      functionality tooltip is displayed when pointing at the different
    icons.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">A <b>Task</b> pulldown menu button appears in the
      <i>qmon</i> main window menu bar. Clicking on it opens a list of available
      tasks. Selecting one of them opens the corresponding dialogue.</dd>

<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Job_Control"><a class="selflink" href="#Job_Control"><b>Job
  Control</b></a></h2>
The <b>Job Control</b> dialogue provides a folder of tabulated lists of the
  still pending jobs, already running jobs and recently finished jobs. The
  dialogue allows for detailed information on the jobs as well as for the
  deletion and suspension of jobs being selected. In addition the job control
  dialogue offers links to the <b>Submit</b> dialogue in order to submit new
  jobs or to change attributes of pending jobs ( <b>Qalter</b> button). The
  fields displayed in the tabular display and the jobs displayed can be
  customized by pressing the <b>Customize</b> button. This customization can be
  saved to the <i>~/.qmon_preferences</i> file and is used on following startup
  for the initial configuration of the <b>Job Control</b> dialogue.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Queue_Control"><a class="selflink" href="#Queue_Control"><b>Queue
  Control</b></a></h2>
The <b>Queue Control</b> dialogue with its sub-dialogue hierarchy enables the
  user to control the status of the Grid Engine queues actually configured in
  the system and allows the administrator to add new queues or to modify or
  delete existing ones. The <b>Queue Control</b> dialogue shows a tabbed view of
  Cluster Queues or their corresponding Queue Instances in a tabular way.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
By pushing the <b>Add</b>, <b>Clone</b> or <b>Modify</b> button, a sub-dialogue
  for configuring Grid Engine queues is opened. A queue needs to be selected to
  use the clone and modify operation. The configuration sub-dialogue allows for
  definition of the queue and its attributes. The configuration sub-dialogue
  contains in the upper section the queue name and a list of hosts or hostgroups
  for which this queue contains the configuration. The lower section contains a
  list of hosts or hostgroups at the left, where the default attributes are
  shown when the &quot;@/&quot; entry is highlighted. These default attributes
  can be overruled on a hostgroup or host basis by enabling attributes and
  changing their values after this hostgroup or host entry has been added in the
  &quot;Attributes for Host/Hostgroup&quot; listbox. The queue configuration
  parameters (see are subdivided into different categories ( <b>General
  Configuration</b>, <b>Execution Methods</b>, <b>Checkpointing</b>,
  <b>Load/Suspend Thresholds</b>, <b>Limits</b>, <b>Complexes</b>, <b>User
  Access</b>, <b>Project Access, </b><b>Subordinate Queues</b><b>,
  </b><b>Owners</b> <b>)</b> <b>which are selectable by the tab widget area
  presented in the lower region</b> <b>of the queue configuration
  sub-dialogue.</b> <b>The administrator may select previously-configured
  settings from</b> <b>already existing queues (</b><b>Clone</b><b> button). By
  pushing the </b> <b>Ok</b><b></b> <b>button, the definitions are registered
  with</b> <b>The </b><b>Queue Control</b><b> dialogue can be customized in a
  similar way as the</b> <b></b><b>Job Control</b><b> dialogue. The settings
  applied here are also saved in</b> <b></b><i>~/.qmon_preferences</i><b>.</b>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Submit"><a class="selflink" href="#Submit"><b>Submit</b></a></h2>
The <b>Job Submission</b> dialogue serves for submitting batch and interactive
  jobs and is also invoked when changing attributes of pending jobs from the
  <b>Job Control</b> dialogue explained above ( <b>Qalter</b> button). To toggle
  between batch and interactive jobs please use the <b>Batch/Interactive</b>
  button at the top of the button column on the right side of the <b>Job
  Submission</b> screen.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The dialogue consists of a folder containing two job preparation dialogue pages.
  The most frequently used parameters in the course of a job submission are
  offered on the <b>General</b> page. A job script has to be defined; all other
  fields are optional. If the job demands specification of advanced
  requirements, the <b>Advanced</b> tab can be used to switch to an enhanced
  parameter display.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If resource requirements are mandatory for the job, the <b>Request Resources</b>
  icon button has to be used to pop up the <b>Requested Resources</b>
  sub-dialogue. This sub-dialogue allows for selection of the required resources
  of the job and for definition of the quantities in which this resources are to
  be provided. The <b>Available Resources</b> are constituted from those complex
  attributes declared <i>requestable</i> (see for details). Resource
  requirements can be made <b>Hard</b>, i.e. they must be met before a job can
  be started in a queue, or <b>Soft</b>, i.e. they are granted on an
  as-available basis.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Closing the <b>Requested Resources</b> sub-dialogue with the done button books
  the specified requirement for the job. Pushing the <b>Submit</b> button on the
  top level <b>Submit</b> dialogue submits the job.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Complex_Config"><a class="selflink" href="#Complex_Config"><b>Complex
  Config</b></a></h2>
The <b>Complex Config</b> allows the administrator to add new complex attributes
  or to modify or delete existing ones (see The complex configuration dialogue
  provides a tabulated list of the complex attribute entries and an input region
  for the declaration of new or modified entries. The <b>Add</b> button updates
  the tabulated list with a new attribute. The <b>Modify</b> button changes a
  highlighted existing entry. The <b>Delete</b> button removes the highlighted
  attributes. The <b>Load and Save</b> buttons allow saving or reloading the
  whole attribute list to or from file. The <b>Ok</b> button registers the
  additional or modified complex attributes with
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Host_Config"><a class="selflink" href="#Host_Config"><b>Host
  Config</b></a></h2>
Four types of host related lists can be maintained via the <b>Host Config</b>
  dialogue:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<pre>
Administration Hosts
Submit Hosts
Host Groups
Execution Hosts
</pre>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The host list to be manipulated is selected via clicking at one of the tabs
  named correspondingly. The first two host lists only provide for adding or
  deleting entries, thereby allowing administrative or submit permission for the
  hosts on the lists, or denying it otherwise respectively. The host group list
  allows the manipulation of host groups. Host groups can reference either other
  host groups or hosts. The execution host list entries in addition provide the
  ability to define scaling factors for the load sensors, consumable complex
  attributes and access attributes (access, xaccess and projects, xprojects) as
  described in CPU, memory and I/O usage reported for running jobs can be scaled
  in addition and the relative performance of a host can be defined with the
  <b>Resource Capability Factor</b> (see
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Cluster_Config"><a class="selflink" href="#Cluster_Config"><b>Cluster
  Config</b></a></h2>
This dialogue maintains the cluster global configuration as well as host
  specific derivatives (see When opened, the dialogue displays a selection list
  for all hosts which have a configuration assigned. The special name
  &quot;global&quot; refers to the cluster global configuration. By pushing the
  <b>Add/Modify</b> button a sub-dialogue is opened, which allows for
  modification of the cluster configuration. For host specific configurations
  the 'global' host specific configuration fields are set insensitive and only
  the allowed parameters can be manipulated.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Scheduler_Config"><a class="selflink" href="#Scheduler_Config"><b>Scheduler
  Config</b></a></h2>
The <b>Scheduler Configuration</b> dialogue provides the means to change the
  behavior of the Grid Engine scheduler thread part of process. The dialogue

</pre>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Those user accounts added to the list of manager or operator accounts are given
  permission to act as managers or operators respectively when accessing Grid
  Engine under their own account.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The userset lists are used together with the <b>user_lists</b> and
  <b>xuser_lists</b> host, queue, project and cluster configuration parameters
  (see and to control access of users to hosts, queues, projects and the entire
  cluster. A userset is just a collection of user names and UNIX group names.
  Group names are identified by prefixing them with a &quot;@&quot; sign. The
  already-defined usersets are displayed in a selection list. These lists can be
  modified, and new lists can be created, using the <b>Userset</b> definition
  dialogue.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Usersets can be used as <b>Access List</b> and/or as <b>Department</b> required
  for the so called <b>Functional Policy</b> and <b>Override Policy</b> (see
  <b>Ticket Config</b> below).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
User names can be added to the system as entries to the Grid Engine user
  database (see here a default project can be attached to the user too. This can
  be done with the <b>User</b> sub-dialogue.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The <b>Tickets</b> button in the button list on the right side of the dialogue
  opens the <b>Ticket Config</b> dialogue (see below).
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="PE_Config"><a class="selflink" href="#PE_Config"><b>PE

Parallel environment (PE) interfaces can be configured with this dialogue. PE
  interfaces are necessary to describe how parallel programming environments
  like PVM (Parallel Virtual Machine), MPI (Message Passing Interface), or
  shared memory parallel systems, are to be instantiated and to impose access
  restrictions onto the PEs. When the dialogue is opened a list of the
  configured PEs is displayed, together with the current configuration (see of
  the selected PE interface. To add new PE interfaces, or to modify existing
  ones, an <b>Add</b> and a <b>Modify</b> button are available which open a PE
  interface configuration sub-dialogue. After applying the changes and quitting

Checkpointing environment interfaces can be configured with this dialogue.
  Checkpointing environments are necessary to describe the attributes which the
  different checkpointing methods and their derivatives on various operating
  system platforms supported by Grid Engine have. When the dialogue is opened a
  list of the already configured checkpointing environments is displayed
  together with the current configuration (see of the selected checkpointing
  environment. To add new checkpointing environments, or to modify existing
  ones, an <b>Add</b> and a <b>Modify</b> button is available which opens a
