<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
PDL::ParallelCPU - Parallel Processor MultiThreading Support
in PDL (Experimental)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
PDL has support (currently experimental) for splitting up
numerical processing between multiple parallel processor
threads (or pthreads) using the set_autopthread_targ and
<br>
set_autopthread_size functions. This can improve processing
performance (by greater than 2-4X in most cases) by taking
advantage of multi-core and/or multi-processor machines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
use PDL;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Set target of 4 parallel
pthreads to create, with a lower limit of <br>
# 5Meg elements for splitting processing into parallel
pthreads. <br>
set_autopthread_targ(4); <br>
set_autopthread_size(5);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$a = zeroes(5000,5000); # Create
25Meg element array</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$b = $a + 5; # Processing will
be split up into multiple pthreads</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Get the actual number of
pthreads for the last <br>
# processing operation. <br>
$actualPthreads = get_autopthread_actual();</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Terminology <br>
The use of the term threading can be confusing with PDL,
because it can refer to PDL threading, as defined in the
PDL::Threading docs, or to processor multi-threading.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To reduce confusion with the
existing PDL threading terminology, this document uses
pthreading to refer to processor multi-threading, which is
the use of multiple processor <br>
threads to split up numerical processing into parallel
operations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Functions that control PDL
PThreads <br>
This is a brief listing and description of the PDL
pthreading functions, see the PDL::Core docs for detailed
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set_autopthread_targ <br>
Set the target number of processor-threads (pthreads) for
multi-threaded processing. Setting auto_pthread_targ to 0
means that no pthreading will occur.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See PDL::Core for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set_autopthread_size <br>
Set the minimum size (in Meg-elements or 2**20 elements) of
the largest PDL involved in a function where auto-pthreading
will be performed. For small PDLs, it probably isn&rsquo;t
<br>
worth starting multiple pthreads, so this function is used
to define a minimum threshold where auto-pthreading
won&rsquo;t be attempted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See PDL::Core for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">get_autopthread_actual <br>
Get the actual number of pthreads executed for the last pdl
processing function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See PDL::get_autopthread_actual
for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Global Control of PDL PThreading
using Environment Variables <br>
PDL PThreading can be globally turned on, without modifying
existing code by setting environment variables
PDL_AUTOPTHREAD_TARG and PDL_AUTOPTHREAD_SIZE before running
a PDL <br>
script. These environment variables are checked when PDL
starts up and calls to set_autopthread_targ and
set_autopthread_size functions made with the environment
variable&rsquo;s <br>
values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, if the environment
var PDL_AUTOPTHREAD_TARG is set to 3, and
PDL_AUTOPTHREAD_SIZE is set to 10, then any pdl script will
run as if the following lines were at the <br>
top of the file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set_autopthread_targ(3); <br>
set_autopthread_size(10);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">How It Works <br>
The auto-pthreading process works by analyzing threaded
array dimensions in PDL operations and splitting up
processing based on the thread dimension sizes and desired
number of <br>
pthreads (i.e. the pthread target or pthread_targ). The
offsets and increments that PDL uses to step thru the data
in memory are modified for each pthread so each one sees a
<br>
different set of data when performing processing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$a = sequence(20,4,3); # Small
3-D Array, size 20,4,3</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Setup auto-pthreading: <br>
set_autopthread_targ(2); # Target of 2 pthreads <br>
set_autopthread_size(0); # Zero so that the small PDLs in
this example will be pthreaded</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># This will be split up into 2
pthreads <br>
$c = maximum($a);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For the above example, the
maximum function has a signature of &quot;(a(n);
[o]c())&quot;, which means that the first dimension of $a
(size 20) is a Core dimension of the maximum function. <br>
The other dimensions of $a (size 4,3) are threaded
dimensions (i.e. will be threaded-over in the maximum
function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The auto-pthreading algorithm
examines the threaded dims of size (4,3) and picks the 4
dimension, since it is evenly divisible by the
autopthread_targ of 2. The processing of the <br>
maximum function is then split into two pthreads on the
size-4 dimension, with dim indexes 0,2 processed by one
pthread <br>
and dim indexes 1,3 processed by the other pthread.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Limitations <br>
Must have POSIX Threads Enabled <br>
Auto-PThreading only works if your PDL installation was
compiled with POSIX threads enabled. This is normally the
case if you are running on linux, or other unix
variants.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Non-Threadsafe Code <br>
Not all the libraries that PDL intefaces to are thread-safe,
i.e. they aren&rsquo;t written to operate in a
multi-threaded environment without crashing or causing
side-effects. Some <br>
examples in the PDL core is the fft function and the pnmout
functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To operate properly with these
types of functions, the PPCode flag NoPthread has been
introduced to indicate a function as not being pthread-safe.
See PDL::PP docs for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Size of PDL Dimensions and
PThread Target <br>
Due to the way a PDL is split-up for operation using
multiple pthreads, the size of a dimension must be evenly
divisible by the pthread target. For example, if a PDL has
threaded <br>
dimension sizes of (4,3,3) and the auto_pthread_targ has
been set to 2, then the first threaded dimension (size 4)
will be picked to be split up into two pthreads of size 2
and <br>
2. However, if the threaded dimension sizes are (3,3,3) and
the auto_pthread_targ is still 2, then pthreading
won&rsquo;t occur, because no threaded dimensions are
divisible by 2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The algorithm that picks the
actual number of pthreads has some smarts (but could
probably be improved) to adjust down from the
auto_pthread_targ to get a number of pthreads that <br>
can evenly divide one of the threaded dimensions. For
example, if a PDL has threaded dimension sizes of (9,2,2)
and the auto_pthread_targ is 4, the algorithm will see that
no <br>
dimension is divisible by 4, then adjust down the target to
3, resulting in splitting up the first threaded dimension
(size 9) into 3 pthreads.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Speed improvement might be less
than you expect. <br>
If you have a 8 core machine and call auto_pthread_targ with
8 to generate 8 parallel pthreads, you probably won&rsquo;t
get a 8X improvement in speed, due to memory bandwidth
issues. <br>
Even though you have 8 separate CPUs crunching away on data,
you will have (for most common machine architectures) common
RAM that now becomes your bottleneck. For simple <br>
calculations (e.g simple additions) you can run into a
performance limit at about <br>
4 pthreads. For more complex calculations the limit will be
higher.</p>
