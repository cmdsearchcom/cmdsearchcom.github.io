PDL::ParallelCPU - Parallel Processor MultiThreading Support in PDL
  (Experimental)
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
PDL has support (currently experimental) for splitting up numerical processing
  between multiple parallel processor threads (or pthreads) using the
  <i>set_autopthread_targ</i> and <i>set_autopthread_size</i> functions. This
  can improve processing performance (by greater than 2-4X in most cases) by
  taking advantage of multi-core and/or multi-processor machines.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<pre>
  use PDL;
  
  # Set target of 4 parallel pthreads to create, with a lower limit of
  #  5Meg elements for splitting processing into parallel pthreads.
  set_autopthread_targ(4);
  set_autopthread_size(5);
  
  $a = zeroes(5000,5000); # Create 25Meg element array
  
  $b = $a + 5; # Processing will be split up into multiple pthreads
  
  # Get the actual number of pthreads for the last
  #  processing operation.
  $actualPthreads = get_autopthread_actual();
</pre>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Terminology"><a class="selflink" href="#Terminology">Terminology</a></h1>
The use of the term <i>threading</i> can be confusing with PDL, because it can
  refer to <i>PDL threading</i>, as defined in the PDL::Threading docs, or to
  <i>processor multi-threading</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To reduce confusion with the existing PDL threading terminology, this document
  uses <b>pthreading</b> to refer to <i>processor multi-threading</i>, which is
  the use of multiple processor threads to split up numerical processing into
  parallel operations.

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Global_Control_of_PDL_PThreading_using_Environment_Variables"><a class="selflink" href="#Global_Control_of_PDL_PThreading_using_Environment_Variables">Global
  Control of PDL PThreading using Environment Variables</a></h1>
PDL PThreading can be globally turned on, without modifying existing code by
  setting environment variables <b>PDL_AUTOPTHREAD_TARG</b> and
  <b>PDL_AUTOPTHREAD_SIZE</b> before running a PDL script. These environment
  variables are checked when PDL starts up and calls to
  <i>set_autopthread_targ</i> and <i>set_autopthread_size</i> functions made
  with the environment variable's values.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For example, if the environment var <b>PDL_AUTOPTHREAD_TARG</b> is set to 3, and
  <b>PDL_AUTOPTHREAD_SIZE</b> is set to 10, then any pdl script will run as if
  the following lines were at the top of the file:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 set_autopthread_targ(3);
 set_autopthread_size(10);
</pre>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="How_It_Works"><a class="selflink" href="#How_It_Works">How
  It Works</a></h1>
The auto-pthreading process works by analyzing threaded array dimensions in PDL
  operations and splitting up processing based on the thread dimension sizes and
  desired number of pthreads (i.e. the pthread target or pthread_targ). The
  offsets and increments that PDL uses to step thru the data in memory are
  modified for each pthread so each one sees a different set of data when
  performing processing.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Example</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 $a = sequence(20,4,3); # Small 3-D Array, size 20,4,3
 
 # Setup auto-pthreading:
 set_autopthread_targ(2); # Target of 2 pthreads
 set_autopthread_size(0); # Zero so that the small PDLs in this example will be pthreaded
 # This will be split up into 2 pthreads
 $c = maximum($a);
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
For the above example, the <i>maximum</i> function has a signature of
  &quot;(a(n); [o]c())&quot;, which means that the first dimension of $a (size
  20) is a <i>Core</i> dimension of the <i>maximum</i> function. The other
  dimensions of $a (size 4,3) are <i>threaded</i> dimensions (i.e. will be
  threaded-over in the <i>maximum</i> function.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The auto-pthreading algorithm examines the threaded dims of size (4,3) and picks
  the 4 dimension, since it is evenly divisible by the autopthread_targ of 2.
  The processing of the maximum function is then split into two pthreads on the
  size-4 dimension, with dim indexes 0,2 processed by one pthread
<br/>
 and dim indexes 1,3 processed by the other pthread.

<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Must_have_POSIX_Threads_Enabled"><a class="selflink" href="#Must_have_POSIX_Threads_Enabled">Must
  have POSIX Threads Enabled</a></h2>
Auto-PThreading only works if your PDL installation was compiled with POSIX
  threads enabled. This is normally the case if you are running on linux, or
  other unix variants.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Non-Threadsafe_Code"><a class="selflink" href="#Non-Threadsafe_Code">Non-Threadsafe
  Code</a></h2>
Not all the libraries that PDL intefaces to are thread-safe, i.e. they aren't
  written to operate in a multi-threaded environment without crashing or causing
  side-effects. Some examples in the PDL core is the <i>fft</i> function and the
  <i>pnmout</i> functions.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To operate properly with these types of functions, the PPCode flag
  <b>NoPthread</b> has been introduced to indicate a function as <i>not</i>
  being pthread-safe. See PDL::PP docs for details.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Size_of_PDL_Dimensions_and_PThread_Target"><a class="selflink" href="#Size_of_PDL_Dimensions_and_PThread_Target">Size
  of PDL Dimensions and PThread Target</a></h2>
Due to the way a PDL is split-up for operation using multiple pthreads, the size
  of a dimension must be evenly divisible by the pthread target. For example, if
  a PDL has threaded dimension sizes of (4,3,3) and the <i>auto_pthread_targ</i>
  has been set to 2, then the first threaded dimension (size 4) will be picked
  to be split up into two pthreads of size 2 and 2. However, if the threaded
  dimension sizes are (3,3,3) and the <i>auto_pthread_targ</i> is still 2, then
  pthreading won't occur, because no threaded dimensions are divisible by 2.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The algorithm that picks the actual number of pthreads has some smarts (but
  could probably be improved) to adjust down from the <i>auto_pthread_targ</i>
  to get a number of pthreads that can evenly divide one of the threaded
  dimensions. For example, if a PDL has threaded dimension sizes of (9,2,2) and
  the <i>auto_pthread_targ</i> is 4, the algorithm will see that no dimension is
  divisible by 4, then adjust down the target to 3, resulting in splitting up
  the first threaded dimension (size 9) into 3 pthreads.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Speed_improvement_might_be_less_than_you_expect."><a class="selflink" href="#Speed_improvement_might_be_less_than_you_expect.">Speed
  improvement might be less than you expect.</a></h2>
If you have a 8 core machine and call <i>auto_pthread_targ</i> with 8 to
  generate 8 parallel pthreads, you probably won't get a 8X improvement in
  speed, due to memory bandwidth issues. Even though you have 8 separate CPUs
  crunching away on data, you will have (for most common machine architectures)
  common RAM that now becomes your bottleneck. For simple calculations (e.g
  simple additions) you can run into a performance limit at about
<br/>
 4 pthreads. For more complex calculations the limit will be higher.
