<p>sane-find-scanner(1) SANE Scanner Access Now Easy
sane-find-scanner(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
sane-find-scanner - find SCSI and USB scanners and their
device files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
sane-find-scanner [-h|-?] [-v] [-q] [-p] [-f] [-F filename]
[devname]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
sane-find-scanner is a command-line tool to find SCSI and
USB scanners and determine their Unix device files. Its
primary aim is to make sure that scanners can be detected by
<br>
SANE backends.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For SCSI scanners, it checks the
default generic SCSI device files (e.g., /dev/sg0) and
/dev/scanner. The test is done by sending a SCSI inquiry
command and looking for a device <br>
type of &quot;scanner&quot; or &quot;processor&quot; (some
old HP scanners seem to send &quot;processor&quot;). So
sane-find-scanner will find any SCSI scanner connected to
those default device files even if <br>
it isn&rsquo;t supported by any SANE backend.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For USB scanners, first the USB
kernel scanner device files (e.g. /dev/usb/scanner0),
/dev/usb/scanner, and /dev/usbscanner) are tested. The files
are opened and the vendor and <br>
device ids are determined, if the operating system supports
this feature. Currently USB scanners are only found this way
if they are supported by the Linux scanner module or the
<br>
FreeBSD or OpenBSD uscanner driver. After that test,
sane-find-scanner tries to scan for USB devices found by the
USB library libusb (if available). There is no special USB
class <br>
for scanners, so the heuristics used to distinguish scanners
from other USB devices is not perfect. sane-find-scanner
also tries to find out the type of USB chip used in the <br>
scanner. If detected, it will be printed after the vendor
and product ids. sane-find-scanner will even find USB
scanners, that are not supported by any SANE backend.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sane-find-scanner won&rsquo;t
find most parallel port scanners, or scanners connected to
proprietary ports. Some parallel port scanners may be
detected by sane-find-scanner -p. At the <br>
time of writing this will only detect Mustek parallel port
scanners.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-h, -? Prints a short usage message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Verbose output. If used once,
sane-find-scanner shows every device name and the test
result. If used twice, SCSI inquiry information and the USB
device descriptors are <br>
also printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Be quiet. Print only the
devices, no comments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p Probe parallel port
scanners.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Force opening all explicitly
given devices as SCSI and USB devices. That&rsquo;s useful
if sane-find-scanner is wrong in determining the device
type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F filename <br>
filename is a file that contains USB descriptors in the
format of /proc/bus/usb/devices as used by Linux.
sane-find-scanner tries to identify the chipset(s) of all
USB <br>
scanners found in such a file. This option is useful for
developers when the output of &quot;cat
/proc/bus/usb/devices&quot; is available but the scanner
itself isn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">devname Test device file
&quot;devname&quot;. No other devices are checked if devname
is given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLE <br>
sane-find-scanner -v <br>
Check all SCSI and USB devices for available scanners and
print a line for every device file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sane-find-scanner /dev/scanner
<br>
Look for a (SCSI) scanner only at /dev/scanner and print the
result.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sane-find-scanner -p <br>
Probe for parallel port scanners.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SUPPORTED PLATFORMS <br>
USB support is limited to Linux (kernel, libusb), FreeBSD
(kernel, libusb), NetBSD (libusb), OpenBSD (kernel, libusb).
Detecting the vendor and device ids only works with Linux
<br>
or libusb.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SCSI support is available on
Irix, EMX, Linux, Next, AIX, Solaris, FreeBSD, NetBSD,
OpenBSD, and HP-UX.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
No support for most parallel port scanners yet. <br>
Detection of USB chipsets is limited to a few chipsets.</p>
