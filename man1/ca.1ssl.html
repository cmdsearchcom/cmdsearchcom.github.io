<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The ca command is a minimal CA application. It can be used
to sign certificate requests in a variety of forms and
generate CRLs it also maintains a text database of issued
<br>
certificates and their status.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The options descriptions will be
divided into each purpose.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CA OPTIONS <br>
-config filename <br>
specifies the configuration file to use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-name section <br>
specifies the configuration file section to use (overrides
default_ca in the ca section).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-in filename <br>
an input filename containing a single certificate request to
be signed by the CA.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ss_cert filename <br>
a single self signed certificate to be signed by the CA.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-spkac filename <br>
a file containing a single Netscape signed public key and
challenge and additional field values to be signed by the
CA. See the SPKAC FORMAT section for information on the <br>
required format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-infiles <br>
if present this should be the last option, all subsequent
arguments are assumed to the the names of files containing
certificate requests.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-out filename <br>
the output file to output certificates to. The default is
standard output. The certificate details will also be
printed out to this file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-outdir directory <br>
the directory to output certificates to. The certificate
will be written to a filename consisting of the serial
number in hex with &quot;.pem&quot; appended.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-cert <br>
the CA certificate file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-keyfile filename <br>
the private key to sign requests with.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-key password <br>
the password used to encrypt the private key. Since on some
systems the command line arguments are visible (e.g. Unix
with the &rsquo;ps&rsquo; utility) this option should be
used with <br>
caution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-selfsign <br>
indicates the issued certificates are to be signed with the
key the certificate requests were signed with (given with
-keyfile). Cerificate requests signed with a different <br>
key are ignored. If -spkac, -ss_cert or -gencrl are given,
-selfsign is ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A consequence of using -selfsign
is that the self-signed certificate appears among the
entries in the certificate database (see the configuration
option database), and uses <br>
the same serial number counter as all other certificates
sign with the self-signed certificate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-passin arg <br>
the key password source. For more information about the
format of arg see the PASS PHRASE ARGUMENTS section in
openssl(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-verbose <br>
this prints extra details about the operations being
performed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-notext <br>
don&rsquo;t output the text form of a certificate to the
output file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-startdate date <br>
this allows the start date to be explicitly set. The format
of the date is YYMMDDHHMMSSZ (the same as an ASN1 UTCTime
structure).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-enddate date <br>
this allows the expiry date to be explicitly set. The format
of the date is YYMMDDHHMMSSZ (the same as an ASN1 UTCTime
structure).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-days arg <br>
the number of days to certify the certificate for.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-md alg <br>
the message digest to use. Possible values include md5, sha1
and mdc2. For full list of digests see openssl dgst -h
output. This option also applies to CRLs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-policy arg <br>
this option defines the CA &quot;policy&quot; to use. This
is a section in the configuration file which decides which
fields should be mandatory or match the CA certificate.
Check out <br>
the POLICY FORMAT section for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msie_hack <br>
this is a legacy option to make ca work with very old
versions of the IE certificate enrollment control
&quot;certenr3&quot;. It used UniversalStrings for almost
everything. Since the <br>
old control has various security bugs its use is strongly
discouraged. The newer control &quot;Xenroll&quot; does not
need this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-preserveDN <br>
Normally the DN order of a certificate is the same as the
order of the fields in the relevant policy section. When
this option is set the order is the same as the request.
<br>
This is largely for compatibility with the older IE
enrollment control which would only accept certificates if
their DNs match the order of the request. This is not needed
<br>
for Xenroll.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-noemailDN <br>
The DN of a certificate can contain the EMAIL field if
present in the request DN, however it is good policy just
having the e-mail set into the altName extension of the <br>
certificate. When this option is set the EMAIL field is
removed from the certificate&rsquo; subject and set only in
the, eventually present, extensions. The email_in_dn keyword
can <br>
be used in the configuration file to enable this
behaviour.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-batch <br>
this sets the batch mode. In this mode no questions will be
asked and all certificates will be certified
automatically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-extensions section <br>
the section of the configuration file containing certificate
extensions to be added when a certificate is issued
(defaults to x509_extensions unless the -extfile option is
<br>
used). If no extension section is present then, a V1
certificate is created. If the extension section is present
(even if it is empty), then a V3 certificate is created. See
<br>
the:w x509v3_config(5) manual page for details of the
extension section format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-extfile file <br>
an additional configuration file to read certificate
extensions from (using the default section unless the
-extensions option is also used).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-engine id <br>
specifying an engine (by its unique id string) will cause ca
to attempt to obtain a functional reference to the specified
engine, thus initialising it if needed. The engine <br>
will then be set as the default for all available
algorithms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-subj arg <br>
supersedes subject name given in the request. The arg must
be formatted as /type0=value0/type1=value1/type2=...,
characters may be escaped by &nbsp;(backslash), no spaces
are <br>
skipped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-utf8 <br>
this option causes field values to be interpreted as UTF8
strings, by default they are interpreted as ASCII. This
means that the field values, whether prompted from a <br>
terminal or obtained from a configuration file, must be
valid UTF8 strings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-multivalue-rdn <br>
this option causes the -subj argument to be interpretedt
with full support for multivalued RDNs. Example:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">/DC=org/DC=OpenSSL/DC=users/UID=123456+CN=John
Doe</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If -multi-rdn is not used then
the UID value is 123456+CN=John Doe.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CRL OPTIONS <br>
-gencrl <br>
this option generates a CRL based on information in the
index file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-crldays num <br>
the number of days before the next CRL is due. That is the
days from now to place in the CRL nextUpdate field.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-crlhours num <br>
the number of hours before the next CRL is due.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-revoke filename <br>
a filename containing a certificate to revoke.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-crl_reason reason <br>
revocation reason, where reason is one of: unspecified,
keyCompromise, CACompromise, affiliationChanged, superseded,
cessationOfOperation, certificateHold or removeFromCRL. <br>
The matching of reason is case insensitive. Setting any
revocation reason will make the CRL v2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In practive removeFromCRL is not
particularly useful because it is only used in delta CRLs
which are not currently implemented.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-crl_hold instruction <br>
This sets the CRL revocation reason code to certificateHold
and the hold instruction to instruction which must be an
OID. Although any OID can be used only <br>
holdInstructionNone (the use of which is discouraged by
RFC2459) holdInstructionCallIssuer or holdInstructionReject
will normally be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-crl_compromise time <br>
This sets the revocation reason to keyCompromise and the
compromise time to time. time should be in GeneralizedTime
format that is YYYYMMDDHHMMSSZ.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-crl_CA_compromise time <br>
This is the same as crl_compromise except the revocation
reason is set to CACompromise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-crlexts section <br>
the section of the configuration file containing CRL
extensions to include. If no CRL extension section is
present then a V1 CRL is created, if the CRL extension
section is <br>
present (even if it is empty) then a V2 CRL is created. The
CRL extensions specified are CRL extensions and not CRL
entry extensions. It should be noted that some software <br>
(for example Netscape) can&rsquo;t handle V2 CRLs. See
x509v3_config(5) manual page for details of the extension
section format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION FILE OPTIONS <br>
The section of the configuration file containing options for
ca is found as follows: If the -name command line option is
used, then it names the section to be used. Otherwise the
<br>
section to be used must be named in the default_ca option of
the ca section of the configuration file (or in the default
section of the configuration file). Besides default_ca, <br>
the following options are read directly from the ca section:
<br>
RANDFILE preserve <br>
msie_hack With the exception of RANDFILE, this is probably a
bug and may change in future releases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Many of the configuration file
options are identical to command line options. Where the
option is present in the configuration file and the command
line the command line value is <br>
used. Where an option is described as mandatory then it must
be present in the configuration file or the command line
equivalent (if any) used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">oid_file <br>
This specifies a file containing additional OBJECT
IDENTIFIERS. Each line of the file should consist of the
numerical form of the object identifier followed by white
space <br>
then the short name followed by white space and finally the
long name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">oid_section <br>
This specifies a section in the configuration file
containing extra object identifiers. Each line should
consist of the short name of the object identifier followed
by = and <br>
the numerical form. The short and long names are the same
when this option is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">new_certs_dir <br>
the same as the -outdir command line option. It specifies
the directory where new certificates will be placed.
Mandatory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">certificate <br>
the same as -cert. It gives the file containing the CA
certificate. Mandatory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">private_key <br>
same as the -keyfile option. The file containing the CA
private key. Mandatory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RANDFILE <br>
a file used to read and write random number seed
information, or an EGD socket (see RAND_egd(3)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">default_days <br>
the same as the -days option. The number of days to certify
a certificate for.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">default_startdate <br>
the same as the -startdate option. The start date to certify
a certificate for. If not set the current time is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">default_enddate <br>
the same as the -enddate option. Either this option or
default_days (or the command line equivalents) must be
present.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">default_crl_hours
default_crl_days <br>
the same as the -crlhours and the -crldays options. These
will only be used if neither command line option is present.
At least one of these must be present to generate a <br>
CRL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">default_md <br>
the same as the -md option. The message digest to use.
Mandatory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">database <br>
the text database file to use. Mandatory. This file must be
present though initially it will be empty.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unique_subject <br>
if the value yes is given, the valid certificate entries in
the database must have unique subjects. if the value no is
given, several valid certificate entries may have the <br>
exact same subject. The default value is yes, to be
compatible with older (pre 0.9.8) versions of OpenSSL.
However, to make CA certificate roll-over easier, it&rsquo;s
<br>
recommended to use the value no, especially if combined with
the -selfsign command line option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">serial <br>
a text file containing the next serial number to use in hex.
Mandatory. This file must be present and contain a valid
serial number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">crlnumber <br>
a text file containing the next CRL number to use in hex.
The crl number will be inserted in the CRLs only if this
file exists. If this file is present, it must contain a <br>
valid CRL number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">x509_extensions <br>
the same as -extensions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">crl_extensions <br>
the same as -crlexts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">preserve <br>
the same as -preserveDN</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">email_in_dn <br>
the same as -noemailDN. If you want the EMAIL field to be
removed from the DN of the certificate simply set this to
&rsquo;no&rsquo;. If not present the default is to allow for
the EMAIL <br>
filed in the certificate&rsquo;s DN.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">msie_hack <br>
the same as -msie_hack</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">policy <br>
the same as -policy. Mandatory. See the POLICY FORMAT
section for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">name_opt, cert_opt <br>
these options allow the format used to display the
certificate details when asking the user to confirm signing.
All the options supported by the x509 utilities -nameopt and
<br>
-certopt switches can be used here, except the no_signame
and no_sigdump are permanently set and cannot be disabled
(this is because the certificate signature cannot be <br>
displayed because the certificate has not been signed at
this point).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For convenience the values
ca_default are accepted by both to produce a reasonable
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If neither option is present the
format used in earlier versions of OpenSSL is used. Use of
the old format is strongly discouraged because it only
displays fields mentioned <br>
in the policy section, mishandles multicharacter string
types and does not display extensions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">copy_extensions <br>
determines how extensions in certificate requests should be
handled. If set to none or this option is not present then
extensions are ignored and not copied to the <br>
certificate. If set to copy then any extensions present in
the request that are not already present are copied to the
certificate. If set to copyall then all extensions in <br>
the request are copied to the certificate: if the extension
is already present in the certificate it is deleted first.
See the WARNINGS section before using this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The main use of this option is
to allow a certificate request to supply values for certain
extensions such as subjectAltName.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">POLICY FORMAT <br>
The policy section consists of a set of variables
corresponding to certificate DN fields. If the value is
&quot;match&quot; then the field value must match the same
field in the CA <br>
certificate. If the value is &quot;supplied&quot; then it
must be present. If the value is &quot;optional&quot; then
it may be present. Any fields not mentioned in the policy
section are silently <br>
deleted, unless the -preserveDN option is set but this can
be regarded more of a quirk than intended behaviour.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SPKAC FORMAT <br>
The input to the -spkac command line option is a Netscape
signed public key and challenge. This will usually come from
the KEYGEN tag in an HTML form to create a new private key.
<br>
It is however possible to create SPKACs using the spkac
utility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The file should contain the
variable SPKAC set to the value of the SPKAC and also the
required DN components as name value pairs. If you need to
include the same component twice <br>
then it can be preceded by a number and a
&rsquo;.&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Note: these examples assume that the ca directory structure
is already set up and the relevant files already exist. This
usually involves creating a CA certificate and private <br>
key with req, a serial number file and an empty index file
and placing them in the relevant directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To use the sample configuration
file below the directories demoCA, demoCA/private and
demoCA/newcerts would be created. The CA certificate would
be copied to demoCA/cacert.pem <br>
and its private key to demoCA/private/cakey.pem. A file
demoCA/serial would be created containing for example
&quot;01&quot; and the empty index file
demoCA/index.txt.</p>

Note: the location of all files can change either by compile

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/usr/local/ssl/lib/openssl.cnf -
master configuration file <br>
./demoCA - main CA directory <br>
./demoCA/cacert.pem - CA certificate <br>
./demoCA/private/cakey.pem - CA private key <br>
./demoCA/serial - CA serial number file <br>
./demoCA/serial.old - CA serial number backup file <br>
./demoCA/index.txt - CA text database file <br>
./demoCA/index.txt.old - CA text database backup file <br>
./demoCA/certs - certificate output file <br>
./demoCA/.rnd - CA random seed information</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
OPENSSL_CONF reflects the location of master configuration
file it can be overridden by the -config command line
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RESTRICTIONS <br>
The text database index file is a critical part of the
process and if corrupted it can be difficult to fix. It is
theoretically possible to rebuild the index file from all
the <br>
issued certificates and a current CRL: however there is no
option to do this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">V2 CRL features like delta CRLs
are not currently supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Although several requests can be
input and handled at once it is only possible to include one
SPKAC or self signed certificate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
The use of an in memory text database can cause problems
when large numbers of certificates are present because, as
the name implies the database has to be kept in memory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ca command really needs
rewriting or the required functionality exposed at either a
command or interface level so a more friendly utility (perl
script or GUI) can handle <br>
things properly. The scripts CA.sh and CA.pl help a little
but not very much.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any fields in a request that are
not present in a policy are silently deleted. This does not
happen if the -preserveDN option is used. To enforce the
absence of the EMAIL field <br>
within the DN, as suggested by RFCs, regardless the contents
of the request&rsquo; subject the -noemailDN option can be
used. The behaviour should be more friendly and
configurable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cancelling some commands by
refusing to certify a certificate can create an empty
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WARNINGS <br>
The ca command is quirky and at times downright
unfriendly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ca utility was originally
meant as an example of how to do things in a CA. It was not
supposed to be used as a full blown CA itself: nevertheless
some people are using it for <br>
this purpose.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ca command is effectively a
single user command: no locking is done on the various files
and attempts to run more than one ca command on the same
database can have <br>
unpredictable results.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The copy_extensions option
should be used with caution. If care is not taken then it
can be a security risk. For example if a certificate request
contains a basicConstraints <br>
extension with CA:TRUE and the copy_extensions value is set
to copyall and the user does not spot this when the
certificate is displayed then this will hand the requestor a
valid <br>
CA certificate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This situation can be avoided by
setting copy_extensions to copy and including
basicConstraints with CA:FALSE in the configuration file.
Then if the request contains a <br>
basicConstraints extension it will be ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is advisable to also include
values for other extensions such as keyUsage to prevent a
request supplying its own values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Additional restrictions can be
placed on the CA certificate itself. For example if the CA
certificate has:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">basicConstraints = CA:TRUE,
pathlen:0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">then even if a certificate is
issued with CA:TRUE it will not be valid.</p>
