<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONE(1) Cone: COnsole Newsreader
And E CONE(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
cone - Read and send E-mail messages</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
cone [-r] [-c directory]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USAGE <br>
Cone is a console newsreader and E-mail. It is an
interactive program for reading and sending E-mail messages.
Cone is designed to be intuitive and easy to learn. Starting
Cone <br>
for the first time displays two links: one for the default
system mailbox, and a second link to a quick online
tutorial. The online tutorial provides a brief overview of
using <br>
Cone for reading and sending E-mail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pressing Q on most screens exits
Cone. Cone tries to gracefully log out and shut down all
server connections. If Cone cannot log out of a remote
server because the remote server <br>
is down, press CTRL-C (after Q to terminate Cone).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use CTRL-Z to temporarily
suspend Cone and drop back to the shell prompt. Cone remains
suspended in the background, and may be restarted by using
the shell&rsquo;s fg command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note <br>
Connections to remote mail servers may be disconnected for
inactivity if Cone remains suspended for a prolonged period
of time. When suspended, Cone cannot maintain any <br>
active connections to remote mail servers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -c option names a directory
where Cone saves its configuration files, and defaults to
$HOME/.cone. The configuration directory will be created, if
necessary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -r option recovers a backup
copy of Cone&rsquo;s configuration file. This option is
primarily used when remote configuration is enabled, but the
folder that contains Cone&rsquo;s <br>
configuration on a remote server was deleted, or is not
available. In all cases, Cone makes a daily local
configuration file backup. The -r option searches for local
<br>
configuration file backups, and offers an option to restore
the backup copy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Reading local mail with Cone
<br>
Cone reads local mail from either maildirs (the preferred
format) or mailbox files (or &quot;mboxes&quot;). When
mboxes are used, Cone does not read the system mailbox file
directly <br>
(usually /var/spool/something). All messages in the system
mailbox are automatically moved to $HOME/Inbox, which is
then accessed as if it was the system mailbox. Starting Cone
<br>
for the first time on an mbox-based system automatically
copies all existing mail from the system mailbox file to
$HOME/Inbox.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is an intentional design
choice. Normal user application cannot create new files in
/var/spool; all they can do is read the mailbox file from
/var/spool. Therefore, the only <br>
way to update the mailbox file is by rewriting it from
scratch (more or less). While the mailbox file is in the
process of being rewritten, if the Cone process is
interrupted, or <br>
killed, the resulted in a corrupted system mailbox. There
are way to minimize this vulnerability, but it cannot be
eliminated completely. Some Linux kernels use an &acirc;OOM
killer&acirc; <br>
that may terminate any process when the system memory is
low. There is no way to completely prevent corrupted system
mailbox files on those kernels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cone uses an alternative way of
updating mboxes. Cone updates mboxes by creating a new mbox
file separately, then replacing the original mbox file with
the new version. <br>
Unfortunately this cannot be done with the system mailbox
file, because of the restricted access rights on the system
spool directory. To solve this problem Cone automatically
<br>
copies the system mailbox file to $HOME/Inbox, each time the
system mailbox file is opened and whenever new mail is
available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Viewing MIME attachments <br>
Cone displays text and simple HTML content by itself. Other
kinds of attachments may be viewed by using a helper script.
Cone invokes a helper script to open a MIME attachment. <br>
The helper script&rsquo;s name is
&acirc;TYPE.SUBTYPE.filter&acirc;, where &acirc;TYPE&acirc;
and &acirc;SUBTYPE&acirc; corresponds to the MIME type and
subtype, accordingly. Cone looks for helper scripts in
$HOME/.cone <br>
(or the directory specified by -c) and in
/usr/share/cone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, a helper script
named &acirc;IMAGE.GIF.filter&acirc;, if installed, is
invoked to process image/gif MIME attachments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Helper scripts <br>
Cone runs each helper script twice:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TYPE.SUBTYPE.filter check
type/subtype</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the first argument is
&acirc;check&acirc;, the helper script should terminate with
a zero exit code if it is willing to process an attachment
whose MIME type is specified by the <br>
second argument. A script or a program that&rsquo;s has
multiple &acirc;TYPE.SUBTYPE.filter&acirc; links may use the
second argument to identify the attachment&rsquo;s mime
type. If the helper <br>
script is unable to process the attachment, at this time, it
should terminate with a non-zero exit code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default helper script for
image attachments terminates with a non-zero exit code if
the DISPLAY environment variable is not initialized. When
invoked from an X-Windows <br>
terminal, image attachments will be automatically displayed;
and image attachments are ignored otherwise on non-graphical
consoles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TYPE.SUBTYPE.filter filter
type/subtype filename</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the helper script initially
terminates with a zero exit code, it will be invoked again
after the MIME attachment is downloaded and decoded. The
first argument will be <br>
&acirc;filter&acirc;, and the attachment&rsquo;s filename is
specified by the third argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note <br>
This is a temporary file, whose extension will not necessary
be the file extension associated with this MIME type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The helper script should read
and process the file specified by the third argument. Cone
interprets anything the helper script writes to standard
output as HTML.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note <br>
Cone waits until the helper script terminates before
displaying the rest of the message. Most helper scripts
should run in the background. However, note that Cone
removes <br>
the temporary file when the original message is closed; the
temporary file may be removed any time after the helper
script terminates. The helper script should make its <br>
own private copy of the file, if necessary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Activating URLs <br>
Cone has limited ability to activate URLs in HTML messages.
Cone handles &acirc;mailto:&acirc;URLs by itself. For other
URLs Cone runs /usr/share/cone/method.handler with the URL
passed as <br>
an argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cone installs http.handler (hard
linked to https.handler). This script checks if firefox or
mozilla binaries are found in the current PATH, and runs
them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note <br>
Cone also looks method.handler in $HOME/.cone (or the
directory specified by -c) in addition to
/usr/share/cone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
$HOME/.cone <br>
Configuration files, and other application data. May be
modified by the -c option.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">/usr/share/cone/IMAGE.GIF.filter,
/usr/share/cone/IMAGE.JPEG.filter,
/usr/share/cone/IMAGE.PNG.filter,
/usr/share/cone/APPLICATION.PDF.filter <br>
Default helper scripts distributed with Cone.</p>
