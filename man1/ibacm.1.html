The IB ACM implements and provides a framework for name, address, and route
  (path) resolution services over InfiniBand. It is intended to address
  connection setup scalability issues running MPI applications on large
  clusters. The IB ACM provides information needed to establish a connection,
  but does not implement the CM protocol.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A primary user of the ibacm service is the librdmacm library. This enables
  applications to make use of the ibacm service without code changes or needing
  to be aware that the service is in use. librdmacm versions 1.0.12 - 1.0.15 can
  invoke IB ACM services when built using the --with-ib_acm option. Version
  1.0.16 and newer of librdmacm will automatically use the IB ACM if it is
  installed. The IB ACM services tie in under the rdma_resolve_addr,
  rdma_resolve_route, and rdma_getaddrinfo routines. For maximum benefit, the
  rdma_getaddrinfo routine should be used, however existing applications should
  still see significant connection scaling benefits using the calls available in
  librdmacm 1.0.11 and previous releases.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The IB ACM is focused on being scalable, efficient, and extensible. It
  implements a plugin architecture that allows a vendor to supply its
  proprietary provider in addition to the default provider. The current default
  provider implementation ibacmp limits network traffic, SA interactions, and
  centralized services. Ibacmp supports multiple resolution protocols in order
  to handle different fabric topologies.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The IB ACM package is comprised of three components: the ibacm core service, the
  default provider ibacmp shared library, and a test/configuration utility -
  ib_acme. All three are userspace components and are available for Linux.
  Additional details are given below.

  START GUIDE</a></h1>
1. Prerequisites: libibverbs and libibumad must be installed. The IB stack
  should be running with IPoIB configured. These steps assume that the user has
  administrative privileges.
<div class="Pp"></div>
2. Install the IB ACM package. This installs ibacm, ibacmp, ib_acme, and init.d
  scripts.
<div class="Pp"></div>
3. Run 'ibacm' as administrator to start the ibacm daemon.
<div class="Pp"></div>
4. Optionally, run 'ib_acme -d &lt;dest_ip&gt; -v' to verify that the ibacm
  service is running.
<div class="Pp"></div>
5. Install librdmacm, using the build option --with-ib_acm if needed. This build
  option is not needed with librdmacm 1.0.17 or newer. The librdmacm will
  automatically use the ibacm service. On failures, the librdmacm will fall back
  to normal resolution.
<div class="Pp"></div>
6. You can use ib_acme -P to gather performance statistics from the local ibacm
  daemon to see if the service is working correctly. Similarly, the command
  ib_acme -e could be used to enumerate all endpoints created by the local ibacm
  service.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="NOTES"><a class="selflink" href="#NOTES">NOTES</a></h1>
ib_acme:
<div class="Pp"></div>
The ib_acme program serves a dual role. It acts as a utility to test ibacm
  operation and help verify if the ibacm service and selected protocol is usable
  for a given cluster configuration. Additionally, it automatically generates
  ibacm configuration files to assist with or eliminate manual setup.
<div class="Pp"></div>
ibacm configuration files:
<div class="Pp"></div>
The ibacm service relies on two configuration files.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The ibacm_addr.cfg file contains name and address mappings for each IB
  &lt;device, port, pkey&gt; endpoint. Although the names in the ibacm_addr.cfg
  file can be anything, ib_acme maps the host name to the IB endpoints. IP
  addresses, on the other hand, are assigned dynamically. If the address file
  cannot be found, the ibacm service will attempt to create one using default
  values.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The ibacm_opts.cfg file provides a set of configurable options for the ibacm
  core service and default provider, such as timeout, number of retries, logging
  level, etc. ib_acme generates the ibacm_opts.cfg file using static
  information. If an option file cannot be found, ibacm will use default values.
<div class="Pp"></div>
ibacm:
<div class="Pp"></div>
The ibacm service is responsible for resolving names and addresses to InfiniBand
  path information and caching such data. It should execute with administrative
  privileges.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The ibacm implements a client interface over TCP sockets, which is abstracted by
  the librdmacm library. One or more providers can be loaded by the core
  service, depending on the configuration. In the default provider ibacmp, one
  or more back-end protocols are used to satisfy user requests. Although ibacmp
  supports standard SA path record queries on the back-end, it also supports a
  resolution protocol based on multicast traffic. The latter is not usable on
  all fabric topologies, specifically ones that may not have reversible paths or
  fabrics using torus routing. Users should use the ib_acme utility to verify
  that multicast protocol is usable before running other applications.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Conceptually, the default provider ibacmp implements an ARP like protocol and
  either uses IB multicast records to construct path record data or queries the
  SA directly, depending on the selected route protocol. By default, the ibacmp
  provider uses and caches SA path record queries.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Specifically, all IB endpoints join a number of multicast groups. Multicast
  groups differ based on rates, mtu, sl, etc., and are prioritized. All
  participating endpoints must be able to communicate on the lowest priority
  multicast group. The ibacmp assigns one or more names/addresses to each IB
  endpoint using the ibacm_addr.cfg file. Clients provide source and destination
  names or addresses as input to the service, and receive as output path record
  data.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The service maps a client's source name/address to a local IB endpoint. If the
  destination name/address is not cached locally in the default provider, it
  sends a multicast request out on the lowest priority multicast group on the
  local endpoint. The request carries a list of multicast groups that the sender
  can use. The recipient of the request selects the highest priority multicast
  group that it can use as well and returns that information directly to the
  sender. The request data is cached by all endpoints that receive the multicast
  request message. The source endpoint also caches the response and uses the
  multicast group that was selected to construct or obtain path record data,
  which is returned to the client.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The current implementation of the provider ibacmp has several additional
  restrictions:
<div class="Pp"></div>
- The ibacmp is limited in its handling of dynamic changes. ibacm must be
  stopped and restarted if a cluster is reconfigured.
<div class="Pp"></div>
- Cached data does not timed out and is only updated if a new resolution request
  is received from a different QPN than a cached request.
<div class="Pp"></div>
- Support for IPv6 has not been verified.
<div class="Pp"></div>
- The number of addresses that can be assigned to a single endpoint is limited
  to 4.
<div class="Pp"></div>
- The number of multicast groups that an endpoint can support is limited to 2.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The ibacmp contains several internal caches. These include caches for GID and
  LID destination addresses. These caches can be optionally preloaded. ibacm
  supports the OpenSM dump_pr plugin &quot;full&quot; PathRecord format which is
  used to preload these caches. The file format is specified in the
  ibacm_opts.cfg file via the route_preload setting which should be set to
  full_opensm_v1 for this file format. Default format is none which does not
  preload these caches. See dump_pr.notes.txt in dump_pr for more information on
  the full_opensm_v1 file format and how to configure OpenSM to generate this
  file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Additionally, the name, IPv4, and IPv6 caches can be be preloaded by using the
  addr_preload option. The default is none which does not preload these caches.
  To preload these caches, set this option to acm_hosts and configure the
  addr_data_file appropriately.
