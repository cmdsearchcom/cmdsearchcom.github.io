<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ibacm - address and route resolution services for
InfiniBand.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ibacm [-D] [-P] [-A addr_file] [-O option_file]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The IB ACM implements and provides a framework for name,
address, and route (path) resolution services over
InfiniBand. It is intended to address connection setup
scalability <br>
issues running MPI applications on large clusters. The IB
ACM provides information needed to establish a connection,
but does not implement the CM protocol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A primary user of the ibacm
service is the librdmacm library. This enables applications
to make use of the ibacm service without code changes or
needing to be aware that the <br>
service is in use. librdmacm versions 1.0.12 - 1.0.15 can
invoke IB ACM services when built using the --with-ib_acm
option. Version 1.0.16 and newer of librdmacm will
automati&acirc; <br>
cally use the IB ACM if it is installed. The IB ACM services
tie in under the rdma_resolve_addr, rdma_resolve_route, and
rdma_getaddrinfo routines. For maximum benefit, the <br>
rdma_getaddrinfo routine should be used, however existing
applications should still see significant connection scaling
benefits using the calls available in librdmacm 1.0.11 and
<br>
previous releases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The IB ACM is focused on being
scalable, efficient, and extensible. It implements a plugin
architecture that allows a vendor to supply its proprietary
provider in addition to <br>
the default provider. The current default provider
implementation ibacmp limits network traffic, SA
interactions, and centralized services. Ibacmp supports
multiple resolution <br>
protocols in order to handle different fabric
topologies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The IB ACM package is comprised
of three components: the ibacm core service, the default
provider ibacmp shared library, and a test/configuration
utility - ib_acme. All three <br>
are userspace components and are available for Linux.
Additional details are given below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-D run in daemon mode (default)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P run as standard process</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A addr_file <br>
address configuration file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O option_file <br>
option configuration file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">QUICK START GUIDE <br>
1. Prerequisites: libibverbs and libibumad must be
installed. The IB stack should be running with IPoIB
configured. These steps assume that the user has
administrative privi&acirc; <br>
leges.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Install the IB ACM package.
This installs ibacm, ibacmp, ib_acme, and init.d
scripts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. Run &rsquo;ibacm&rsquo; as
administrator to start the ibacm daemon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. Optionally, run
&rsquo;ib_acme -d &lt;dest_ip&gt; -v&rsquo; to verify that
the ibacm service is running.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5. Install librdmacm, using the
build option --with-ib_acm if needed. This build option is
not needed with librdmacm 1.0.17 or newer. The librdmacm
will automatically use the <br>
ibacm service. On failures, the librdmacm will fall back to
normal resolution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6. You can use ib_acme -P to
gather performance statistics from the local ibacm daemon to
see if the service is working correctly. Similarly, the
command ib_acme -e could be <br>
used to enumerate all endpoints created by the local ibacm
service.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
ib_acme:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ib_acme program serves a
dual role. It acts as a utility to test ibacm operation and
help verify if the ibacm service and selected protocol is
usable for a given cluster <br>
configuration. Additionally, it automatically generates
ibacm configuration files to assist with or eliminate manual
setup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ibacm configuration files:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ibacm service relies on two
configuration files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ibacm_addr.cfg file contains
name and address mappings for each IB &lt;device, port,
pkey&gt; endpoint. Although the names in the ibacm_addr.cfg
file can be anything, ib_acme maps <br>
the host name to the IB endpoints. IP addresses, on the
other hand, are assigned dynamically. If the address file
cannot be found, the ibacm service will attempt to create
one <br>
using default values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ibacm_opts.cfg file provides
a set of configurable options for the ibacm core service and
default provider, such as timeout, number of retries,
logging level, etc. ib_acme <br>
generates the ibacm_opts.cfg file using static information.
If an option file cannot be found, ibacm will use default
values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ibacm:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ibacm service is responsible
for resolving names and addresses to InfiniBand path
information and caching such data. It should execute with
administrative privileges.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ibacm implements a client
interface over TCP sockets, which is abstracted by the
librdmacm library. One or more providers can be loaded by
the core service, depending on the <br>
configuration. In the default provider ibacmp, one or more
back-end protocols are used to satisfy user requests.
Although ibacmp supports standard SA path record queries on
the <br>
back-end, it also supports a resolution protocol based on
multicast traffic. The latter is not usable on all fabric
topologies, specifically ones that may not have reversible
<br>
paths or fabrics using torus routing. Users should use the
ib_acme utility to verify that multicast protocol is usable
before running other applications.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Conceptually, the default
provider ibacmp implements an ARP like protocol and either
uses IB multicast records to construct path record data or
queries the SA directly, depending <br>
on the selected route protocol. By default, the ibacmp
provider uses and caches SA path record queries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specifically, all IB endpoints
join a number of multicast groups. Multicast groups differ
based on rates, mtu, sl, etc., and are prioritized. All
participating endpoints must <br>
be able to communicate on the lowest priority multicast
group. The ibacmp assigns one or more names/addresses to
each IB endpoint using the ibacm_addr.cfg file. Clients
provide <br>
source and destination names or addresses as input to the
service, and receive as output path record data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The service maps a
client&rsquo;s source name/address to a local IB endpoint.
If the destination name/address is not cached locally in the
default provider, it sends a multicast <br>
request out on the lowest priority multicast group on the
local endpoint. The request carries a list of multicast
groups that the sender can use. The recipient of the request
<br>
selects the highest priority multicast group that it can use
as well and returns that information directly to the sender.
The request data is cached by all endpoints that <br>
receive the multicast request message. The source endpoint
also caches the response and uses the multicast group that
was selected to construct or obtain path record data, which
<br>
is returned to the client.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The current implementation of
the provider ibacmp has several additional restrictions:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- The ibacmp is limited in its
handling of dynamic changes. ibacm must be stopped and
restarted if a cluster is reconfigured.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Cached data does not timed out
and is only updated if a new resolution request is received
from a different QPN than a cached request.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Support for IPv6 has not been
verified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- The number of addresses that
can be assigned to a single endpoint is limited to 4.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- The number of multicast groups
that an endpoint can support is limited to 2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ibacmp contains several
internal caches. These include caches for GID and LID
destination addresses. These caches can be optionally
preloaded. ibacm supports the OpenSM <br>
dump_pr plugin &quot;full&quot; PathRecord format which is
used to preload these caches. The file format is specified
in the ibacm_opts.cfg file via the route_preload setting
which should <br>
be set to full_opensm_v1 for this file format. Default
format is none which does not preload these caches. See
dump_pr.notes.txt in dump_pr for more information on the
<br>
full_opensm_v1 file format and how to configure OpenSM to
generate this file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Additionally, the name, IPv4,
and IPv6 caches can be be preloaded by using the
addr_preload option. The default is none which does not
preload these caches. To preload these <br>
caches, set this option to acm_hosts and configure the
addr_data_file appropriately.</p>
