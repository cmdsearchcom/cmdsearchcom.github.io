<p>SENDFAX(1) General Commands Manual SENDFAX(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
sendfax - submit a facsimile job for transmission</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
sendfax [ options ] [ files... ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
sendfax submits one or more facsimile transmission requests
to a HylaFAX facsimile server. Requests are normally
processed immediately, although they may also be queued for
<br>
transmission at a later time using a syntax identical to the
at(1) command. For each job that is queued, sendfax prints a
job identifier and a job group identifier on the stan&acirc;
<br>
dard output. A job identifier is the token by which jobs are
identified within HylaFAX; job group identifiers are used to
reference a set of jobs that have been submitted at the <br>
same time. Job and job group identifiers can be supplied to
the faxrm(1) command to remove the jobs or to the
faxalter(1) command to alter job parameters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Facsimile are made from the
concatenation of a cover page (see below) and one or more
files specified on the command line. If no files are
supplied on the command line, sendfax <br>
will read data from the standard input unless polling is
requested. Cover pages are distinguished for the purpose of
generating &lsquo;&lsquo;continuation cover
pages&rsquo;&rsquo; on the server; these <br>
are makeup cover pages that are automatically generated if a
job fails after sending the original user-specified cover
page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sendfax passes
POSTSCRIPT&Acirc;&reg; and TIFF documents directly through
to the fax server for transmission, and attempts to convert
other file formats to either POSTSCRIPT or TIFF. In <br>
normal operation sendfax automatically converts ASCII-text,
troff(1) output, Portable Document Format (PDF), and Silicon
Graphics format images for transmission. Support for <br>
other file formats can be easily added through an extensible
file typing and conversion facility; see typerules(5). Note
that since TIFF Class F documents are processed directly
<br>
it is simple to forward a received facsimile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default sendfax will generate
a cover page for each facsimile that is to be transmitted.
This cover page is created by the ancillary faxcover(1)
program using information <br>
deduced by sendfax and by information supplied on the
command line. Automatic cover page generation may be
suppressed with the -n option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition to sending
documents, sendfax can be used to poll a remote facsimile
machine to retrieve waiting documents. If the -p option is
specified, a polling request will be <br>
submitted to each destination. If a poll request is made in
conjunction with the transmission of documents, the poll
request will take place after the documents are transmitted.
<br>
Documents retrieved by polling are returned to the requestor
by electronic mail and may be viewed with a suitable viewer
program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One or more destinations must be
specified on the command line using the -d option. A
destination is the dialing string to use to contact the
remote fax machine. Phone numbers <br>
may include non-alphanumeric characters for
readability&acirc;only alphanumerics,
&lsquo;&lsquo;+&rsquo;&rsquo; (for denoting a country code),
and &lsquo;&lsquo;#&rsquo;&rsquo; (for denoting a
subaddress) are significant in placing <br>
a call. Alphabetic characters are automatically mapped to
their numeric key equivalents:
&lsquo;&lsquo;abcABC&rsquo;&rsquo; to
&lsquo;&lsquo;2&rsquo;&rsquo;,
&lsquo;&lsquo;defDEF&rsquo;&rsquo; to
&lsquo;&lsquo;3&rsquo;&rsquo;, etc. Dialing prefixes, such
as &lsquo;&lsquo;1&rsquo;&rsquo; and <br>
&lsquo;&lsquo;011&rsquo;&rsquo; (for long distance calling
in the United States) need not be included if an unambiguous
number is specified. Examples of unambiguous phone numbers
are: <br>
+31.77.594.131 to call the Netherlands <br>
+14159657824 to call California <br>
9657824 to make a local call <br>
1-215-356-1666 to call Pennsylvania from within the US <br>
Non-numeric strings, such as &lsquo;&lsquo;*70&rsquo;&rsquo;
(to defeat call waiting), may be included in the destination
phone number. Whether or not they are stripped from the
string used to dial the <br>
destination fax machine is dependent on the dialstring rules
configured for use on the server; c.f. hylafax-config(5) and
dialrules(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A destination may also be
specified as user@fax-number. In this case the user string
will be passed to faxcover as the identity of the recipient.
Note that multi-word names <br>
must be enclosed in quote marks; for example,
&lsquo;&lsquo;Sam Leffler@+1.415.555.1212&rsquo;&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The order of options on the
command line is significant. Each fax to be transmitted is
assigned the current value of parameters specified on the
command line; e.g. whether or <br>
not to generate a cover page. This means that options that
specify parameters for a particular destination must precede
the dialstring specified with the -d option. For exam&acirc;
<br>
ple,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sendfax -n -d 5551212
/etc/passwd</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">submits a fax to 5551212 that
has no cover page while</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sendfax -d 5551212 -n
/etc/passwd</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">submits the same fax but with
the default cover page handling. Note also that parameter
values persist across -d options so the following</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sendfax -n -d 5551212 -d 5551313
/etc/network</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">submits two facsimile, both of
which have no cover page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-1 Transmit facsimile documents using 1-D MH compression. By
default HylaFAX will use the optimal compression scheme
supported by the transmitting modem and receiving <br>
facsimile device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-2 Transmit facsimile documents
using 2-D MR compression, if possible. By default HylaFAX
will use the optimal compression scheme supported by the
transmitting modem <br>
and receiving facsimile device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-3 Transmit facsimile documents
using 2-D MMR compression, if possible. By default HylaFAX
will use the optimal compression scheme supported by the
transmitting modem <br>
and receiving facsimile device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a time Schedule transmission up
to one year in advance at the indicated time. Time is
specified in the format: &lsquo;&lsquo;HH:MM [AM|PM] | now
[+ N period | month DD | dayofweek
]&Acirc;&acute;&Acirc;&acute; <br>
where month can be Jan(uary), Feb(ruary), Mar(ch), Apr(il),
May, Jun(e), Jul(y), Aug(ust), Sep(tember), Oct(ober),
Nov(ember), or Dec(ember); period can be minute(s), <br>
hour(s), day(s), week(s), or month(s); dayofweek can be
Mon(day), Tue(sday), Wed(nesday), Thu(rsday), Fri(day),
Sat(urday), Sun(day); e.g. &lsquo;&lsquo;now + 30
minutes&Acirc;&acute;&Acirc;&acute; to <br>
schedule transmission 30 minutes in the future. Trailing
information in the time field (such as YYYY) is ignored. By
default, sendfax schedules facsimile for imme&acirc; <br>
diate delivery. Time should be given in the user&rsquo;s
local time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A Archive the job on the server
according to the bin/archive script when the job is
done.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b speed Transmit facsimile
documents using a signalling rate that is constrained to be
at least speed bits/second. If the specified speed is
greater than the transmitting <br>
modem or receiver is capable of, it is reduced to the
highest possible speed both devices support. If a negotiated
signalling rate greater than or equal to speed <br>
cannot be negotiated then the job is aborted. Possible
speeds are: 2400, 4800, 7200, 9600, 12000, 14400, 16800,
19200, 21600, 24000, 26400, 28800, 31200, and 33600. <br>
By default HylaFAX will use the fastest possible rate
supported by the transmitting modem and receiving facsimile
device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B speed Try to transmit
facsimile documents using the desired signalling rate.
Possible speeds are: 2400, 4800, 7200, 9600, 12000, 14400,
16800, 19200, 21600, 24000, 26400, <br>
28800, 31200, and 33600. If the specified speed is greater
than the transmitting modem or receiver is capable of, it is
reduced to the highest possible speed both <br>
devices support. By default HylaFAX will use the fastest
possible rate supported by the transmitting modem and
receiving facsimile device (unless restricted by other <br>
server configuration); this option can be used to reduce the
speed. Note that international calls are frequently more
reliable when transmissions are restricted to <br>
9600 bits/second. For Class 1/1.0 devices, if the specified
speed is not greater than 14400 then V.34 will not be
attempted, and if the specified speed is 9600 or <br>
7200 then V.29 will be assumed in lieu of V.17.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c comments Pass comments to the
faxcover(1) program for inclusion in the comments field of
any generated cover page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C file Pass file to the
faxcover(1) program for use as the cover page template.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D Enable notification by
electronic mail when the facsimile has been delivered. By
default HylaFAX will notify the submitter only if there is a
problem with a job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d destination <br>
Create a job to transmit the supplied documents to a
facsimile machine at the indicated destination. If the
destination is of the form
&lsquo;&lsquo;user@phone-number#subad&acirc; <br>
dress&rsquo;&rsquo; then any cover page will show user as
the intended recipient, and the remote system will be
supplied the subaddress value (i.e. for routing) provided
that the <br>
sending modem and the receiving system support it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E Disable use of the Error
Correction Mode (ECM) when transmitting page data. Setting
ECM to false will limit the maximum speed to 14400 bps. By
default HylaFAX will <br>
attempt to use ECM when both the transmitting modem and
receiving device support it. Note that international calls
are sometimes faster when ECM is disabled. Beware <br>
also that some modems and/or facsimile devices do not
properly implement ECM causing transmission failures.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f from Use from as the identity
of the facsimile sender. Otherwise the sender is the user
that invoked sendfax. The sender is an account name to which
the HylaFAX software <br>
should direct notification messages. The from identity may
be a fullblown &lsquo;&lsquo;From:&rsquo;&rsquo; line, e.g.
e.g. &lsquo;&lsquo;Joe Blow
&lt;joe@foo.com&gt;&rsquo;&rsquo; and
&lsquo;&lsquo;joe@foo.com (Joe Blow)&rsquo;&rsquo; are <br>
acceptable. If no host-part is specified in the from string
the local hostname is used. This option is useful when
sendfax is invoked on behalf of another user, <br>
such as in the implementation of an electronic mail to fax
gateway.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F format Use the specified
format when imaging tag lines on outgoing pages. Consult the
description of the TagLineFormat parameter in
hylafax-config(5) for an explanation of <br>
how to construct a format string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that many locales require
that proper identification appear on all transmitted
facsimile; when using this facility one should always
include proper identifica&acirc; <br>
tion (e.g. a phone number) in the imaged taglines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-G Enable usage of any extended
resolutions supported by the receiver. -G supersedes the
usage of any -l or -m options. Beware that increased
resolution will increase <br>
transmission time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h [modem@]host[:port] <br>
Force the jobs to be processed on a specific host and,
optionally, using a particular modem. The host may be either
a symbolic name or a network address. If no -h <br>
option is supplied, sendfax uses the FAXSERVER environment
variable to identify the HylaFAX server to which the jobs
should be directed. If no server is specified <br>
then sendfax attempts to contact a server on the local host.
If no modem is specified, the job will be submitted to any
available modem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i identifier <br>
Use the identifier string in any notification messages
instead of the usual job identifier number. This option is
useful for applications that cross reference noti&acirc;
<br>
fication messages against job submissions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I time If a job must be
requeued because of a communication failure schedule the
retry according to the specified time. Times are given in
seconds. Minutes, hours, and <br>
days can be specified with &lsquo;&lsquo;min&rsquo;&rsquo;,
&lsquo;&lsquo;hour&rsquo;&rsquo;, and
&lsquo;&lsquo;day&rsquo;&rsquo; suffixes, respectively. By
default HylaFAX reschedules jobs using retry times that
depend on the manner in <br>
which the job failed; this interface permits a user to
override this algorithm and specify a single fixed retry
time for all communication failures.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k time Kill the job if it does
not complete in the indicated time. The time is specified
using notation identical to the -a option. Note that the
time is relative to the <br>
time of the initial time-to-send. The default kill time is
&lsquo;&lsquo;now + 3 hours&rsquo;&rsquo; (three hours from
the time the job is first processed). To retry for an hour,
&lsquo;&lsquo;now +1 <br>
hour&rsquo;&rsquo; could be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l Transmit the facsimile at a
vertical resolution of 98 lines/inch; otherwise known as low
resolution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m Transmit the facsimile at a
vertical resolution of 196 lines/inch; otherwise known as
medium resolution or fine mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M mst Transmit facsimile
documents using the specified minimum scanline time.
Possible times are: 0ms, 5ms, 10ms2, 10ms, 20ms2, 20ms,
40ms2, and 40ms. If the specified <br>
time is less than the transmitting modem or receiver is
capable of, it is increased to the lowest possible time both
devices support. By default HylaFAX will use the <br>
lowest possible time supported by the transmitting modem and
receiving facsimile device (unless restricted by other
server configuration). This option is mostly use&acirc; <br>
ful for debugging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Suppress the automatic
generation of a cover page for subsequent facsimile. Note
that polling requests do not receive a cover page unless
they are combined with the <br>
transmission of one or more files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N Do not notify the sender by
electronic mail when the facsimile has been delivered or
requeued.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o owner Specify the fax owner
login name, replacing any FAXUSER environment variable that
may be set for the same purpose. If neither is specified,
the user&rsquo;s current login <br>
name is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p Poll each destination for any
available documents. If a poll request is made together with
document transmission, the poll operation is done after the
documents are <br>
transmitted. Documents received by polling are returned to
the sender by electronic mail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P priority Assign the specified
scheduling priority to subsequent jobs. A priority is an
integer value in the range [0-255]. Lower values result in
higher priority processing. <br>
By default, each job is assigned 127 for an initial
scheduling priority. If a job&rsquo;s priority is greater
than bulk faxes then the job&rsquo;s priority is raised
(numeri&acirc; <br>
cally lowered) for each failed attempt to transmit so that
retransmit attempts are done ahead of newly submitted jobs.
In the case of bulk faxes (numerically higher <br>
than 190), then the job&rsquo;s priority is lowered
(numerically raised) for each failed attempt to transmit so
that the whole of the bulk-queued jobs will be attempted
<br>
before any are retried. The priority may also be specified
as one of the following symbolic names: default or normal
(127), bulk or junk (191), low (190), or high <br>
(63).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R Enable notification by
electronic mail when the facsimile has been delivered and
when it is requeued for retransmission. By default HylaFAX
will notify the submitter <br>
only if there is a problem with a job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r regarding <br>
Pass regarding to the faxcover(1) program as the value of
the &lsquo;&lsquo;Re:&rsquo;&rsquo; field of any generated
cover page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s size Set the page size to use
for the transmitted facsimile. Facsimile are normally imaged
with a system-default page size (usually letter-size pages,
8.5&quot; by 11&quot;, for <br>
sites in North America). Alternate page sizes are specified
symbolically using either the name or abbreviation of an
entry in the pagesizes(5) database; e.g. a3 <br>
(ISO A3), a4 (ISO A4), a5 (ISO A5), a6 (ISO A6), b4 (ISO
B4), na-let (North American Letter), us-leg (American
Legal), us-led (American Ledger), us-exe (American <br>
Executive), jp-let (Japanese Letter), and jp-leg (Japanese
Legal). Comparisons are case-insensitive and any match of a
substring of the full page-size name is suffi&acirc; <br>
cient; e.g. &lsquo;&lsquo;legal&rsquo;&rsquo; would match
&lsquo;&lsquo;American Legal&rsquo;&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that it may not be
permissible to image into the full page area; the guaranteed
reproducible area for a page is typically inset. Also, note
that while arbitrary <br>
page sizes can be specified through the page size database,
only a limited set of page dimensions are supported by the
Group 3 facsimile protocol. Thus if an odd- <br>
size facsimile is submitted for transmission it may not be
possible to determine if it can be sent until the fax server
establishes communication with the remote fac&acirc; <br>
simile machine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S tsi Pass tsi to the server as
the suggested sender identification to be used, for example,
in tagline imaging and fax protocol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t tries Make no more than tries
attempts to send the facsimile. By default, HylaFAX will
terminate a job if 3 consecutive attempts to send a
particular page fail, or it <br>
appears the receiver is not a facsimile machine. Otherwise
HylaFAX places no limit on the number of attempts to send a
facsimile, instead terminating a job if it is <br>
not completed within a kill time timeout interval. Note that
a try is a call in which carrier is established and the
facsimile protocol is commenced; this is con&acirc; <br>
trasted with a call attempt that might have failed because
the line was busy. Use &lsquo;&lsquo;-1&rsquo;&rsquo; to
indicate that no tries value should be specified to the
server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T maxdials Make no more than
maxdials calls in attempting to send the facsimile. By
default, HylaFAX will redial 12 times before killing a job.
Use &lsquo;&lsquo;-1&rsquo;&rsquo; to indicate that no <br>
maxdials value should be specified to the server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U voice-no Pass voice-no to the
faxcover(1) program as the sender&rsquo;s voice number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V voice-no Pass voice-no to the
faxcover(1) program as the destination person&rsquo;s voice
number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w Wait for the job to complete
before ending the sendfax session. If this option is used,
the sendfax process will not terminate until the job is
completed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-W fax-no Pass fax-no to the
faxcover(1) program as the sender&rsquo;s fax number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x company Pass company to the
faxcover(1) program as the destination company name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X company Pass company to the
faxcover(1) program as the sender&rsquo;s company name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-y location Pass location to the
faxcover(1) program as the destination company&rsquo;s
location.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Y location Pass location to the
faxcover(1) program as the sender&rsquo;s company
location.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z filename Read destinations
from filename which contains a list of the destinations
formatted identically as destinations for the -d option, one
per line. Usage of this option <br>
is similar to the -d option and may be done in conjunction
with other -d and -z options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Print information on the
standard output about each conversion and cover sheet
generation operation it does. If -v is specified twice, the
protocol between sendfax <br>
and the hfaxd server process that does the submission work
on the remote machine is also displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Z range Specify that only
certain pages of the fax should actually be transmitted. The
range is in a comma-seperated list of ranges in the form of
A[-B][,....]. The range <br>
is specified agains the resulting document to be faxed,
excluding any cover pages. So if you have more than one
document, make sure to account for them, and exclude <br>
the cover pages in the range specification. Cover pages will
always be faxed, so a fax with a coverpage and 2 5 page
documents with a range specified of of 1,3,10 <br>
will fax the cover page, and pages 1, 3, and 10 of the
combined documents (page 1 and 3 from the first document,
and page 5 of the second document).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS <br>
sendfax reads configuration information from the files
/etc/hylafax/hfaxd.conf, /etc/hylafax/hyla.conf,
/etc/hylafax/sendfax.conf, and ~/.hylarc; in that order,

(Equivalent to the -n option.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ChopThreshold The amount of
white space, in inches, that must be present at the bottom
of a page before HylaFAX will attempt to truncate the page
transmission.</p>
