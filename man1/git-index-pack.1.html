<p>GIT-INDEX-PACK(1) Git Manual GIT-INDEX-PACK(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
git-index-pack - Build pack index file for an existing
packed archive</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
git index-pack [-v] [-o &lt;index-file&gt;]
&lt;pack-file&gt; <br>
git index-pack --stdin [--fix-thin] [--keep] [-v] [-o
&lt;index-file&gt;] <br>
[&lt;pack-file&gt;]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Reads a packed archive (.pack) from the specified file, and
builds a pack index file (.idx) for it. The packed archive
together with the pack index can then be placed in the <br>
objects/pack/ directory of a Git repository.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-v <br>
Be verbose about what is going on, including progress
status.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o &lt;index-file&gt; <br>
Write the generated pack index into the specified file.
Without this option the name of pack index file is
constructed from the name of packed archive file by
replacing .pack <br>
with .idx (and the program fails if the name of packed
archive does not end with .pack).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--stdin <br>
When this flag is provided, the pack is read from stdin
instead and a copy is then written to &lt;pack-file&gt;. If
&lt;pack-file&gt; is not specified, the pack is written to
<br>
objects/pack/ directory of the current Git repository with a
default name determined from the pack content. If
&lt;pack-file&gt; is not specified consider using --keep to
prevent a <br>
race condition between this process and git repack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--fix-thin <br>
Fix a &quot;thin&quot; pack produced by git pack-objects
--thin (see git-pack-objects(1) for details) by adding the
excluded objects the deltified objects are based on to the
pack. <br>
This option only makes sense in conjunction with
--stdin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--keep <br>
Before moving the index into its final destination create an
empty .keep file for the associated pack file. This option
is usually necessary with --stdin to prevent a <br>
simultaneous git repack process from deleting the newly
constructed pack and index before refs can be updated to use
objects contained in the pack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--keep=&lt;msg&gt; <br>
Like --keep create a .keep file before moving the index into
its final destination, but rather than creating an empty
file place &lt;msg&gt; followed by an LF into the .keep
file. <br>
The &lt;msg&gt; message can later be searched for within all
.keep files to locate any which have outlived their
usefulness.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--index-version=&lt;version&gt;[,&lt;offset&gt;]
<br>
This is intended to be used by the test suite only. It
allows to force the version for the generated pack index,
and to force 64-bit index entries on objects located above
<br>
the given offset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--strict <br>
Die, if the pack contains broken objects or links.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--threads=&lt;n&gt; <br>
Specifies the number of threads to spawn when resolving
deltas. This requires that index-pack be compiled with
pthreads otherwise this option is ignored with a warning.
This <br>
is meant to reduce packing time on multiprocessor machines.
The required amount of memory for the delta search window is
however multiplied by the number of threads. <br>
Specifying 0 will cause Git to auto-detect the number of
CPU&acirc;s and use maximum 3 threads.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE <br>
Once the index has been created, the list of object names is
sorted and the SHA-1 hash of that list is printed to stdout.
If --stdin was also used then this is prefixed by either
<br>
&quot;pack&quot;, or &quot;keep&quot; if a new .keep file
was successfully created. This is useful to remove a .keep
file used as a lock to prevent the race with git repack
mentioned above.</p>
