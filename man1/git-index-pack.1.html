git-index-pack - Build pack index file for an existing packed archive

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
Reads a packed archive (.pack) from the specified file, and builds a pack index
  file (.idx) for it. The packed archive together with the pack index can then
  be placed in the objects/pack/ directory of a Git repository.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
-v
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Be verbose about what is going on, including
  progress status.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-o &lt;index-file&gt;
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Write the generated pack index into the
  specified file. Without this option the name of pack index file is constructed
  from the name of packed archive file by replacing .pack with .idx (and the
  program fails if the name of packed archive does not end with .pack).</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
--stdin
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">When this flag is provided, the pack is read
  from stdin instead and a copy is then written to &lt;pack-file&gt;. If
  &lt;pack-file&gt; is not specified, the pack is written to objects/pack/
  directory of the current Git repository with a default name determined from
  the pack content. If &lt;pack-file&gt; is not specified consider using --keep
  to prevent a race condition between this process and <i>git repack</i>.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
--fix-thin
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Fix a &quot;thin&quot; pack produced by git
  pack-objects --thin (see <b>git-pack-objects</b>(1) for details) by adding the
  excluded objects the deltified objects are based on to the pack. This option
  only makes sense in conjunction with --stdin.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
--keep
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Before moving the index into its final
  destination create an empty .keep file for the associated pack file. This
  option is usually necessary with --stdin to prevent a simultaneous <i>git
  repack</i> process from deleting the newly constructed pack and index before
  refs can be updated to use objects contained in the pack.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
--keep=&lt;msg&gt;
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Like --keep create a .keep file before moving
  the index into its final destination, but rather than creating an empty file
  place <i>&lt;msg&gt;</i> followed by an LF into the .keep file. The
  <i>&lt;msg&gt;</i> message can later be searched for within all .keep files to
  locate any which have outlived their usefulness.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
--index-version=&lt;version&gt;[,&lt;offset&gt;]
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">This is intended to be used by the test suite
  only. It allows to force the version for the generated pack index, and to
  force 64-bit index entries on objects located above the given offset.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
--strict
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Die, if the pack contains broken objects or
  links.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
--threads=&lt;n&gt;
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Specifies the number of threads to spawn when
  resolving deltas. This requires that index-pack be compiled with pthreads
  otherwise this option is ignored with a warning. This is meant to reduce
  packing time on multiprocessor machines. The required amount of memory for the
  delta search window is however multiplied by the number of threads. Specifying
  0 will cause Git to auto-detect the number of CPU&#x2019;s and use maximum 3
  threads.</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="NOTE"><a class="selflink" href="#NOTE">NOTE</a></h1>
Once the index has been created, the list of object names is sorted and the
  SHA-1 hash of that list is printed to stdout. If --stdin was also used then
  this is prefixed by either &quot;pack\t&quot;, or &quot;keep\t&quot; if a new
  .keep file was successfully created. This is useful to remove a .keep file
  used as a lock to prevent the race with <i>git repack</i> mentioned above.
