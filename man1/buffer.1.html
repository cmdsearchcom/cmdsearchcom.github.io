<p>BUFFER(1) General Commands Manual BUFFER(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
buffer - very fast reblocking program</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNTAX <br>
buffer [-S size] [-b blocks] [-s size] [-z size] [-m size]
[-p percentage] [-u microseconds] [-B] [-t] [-Z] [-i
filename] [-o filename] [-d]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-i filename <br>
Use the given file as the input file. The default is
stdin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o filename <br>
Use the given file as the output file. The default is
stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S size <br>
After every chunk of this size has been written, print out
how much has been written so far. Also prints the total
throughput. By default this is not set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s size <br>
Size in bytes of each block. The default blocksize is 10k to
match the normal output of the tar(1) program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z size <br>
Combines the -S and -s flags.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b blocks <br>
Number of blocks to allocate to shared memory circular
buffer. Defaults to the number required to fill up the
shared memory requested.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m size <br>
Maximum size of the shared memory chunk to allocate for the
circular queue. Defaults to one megabyte.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p percentage <br>
Only start a write when the given percentage of the internal
queue is full. A percentage around 75 often proves best.
Defaults to zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u microseconds <br>
After every write pause for this many microseconds. Defaults
to zero. (Surprisingly a small sleep, 100 usecs, after each
write can greatly enhance throughput on some <br>
drives.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B Force each block written to
be padded out to the blocksize. This is needed by some tape
and cartridge drives. Defaults to unpadded. This only
affects the last block writ&acirc; <br>
ten.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t On exiting print to stderr a
brief message showing the total number of bytes written.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Z If reading/writing directly
to a character device (like a tape drive) then after each
gigabyte perform an lseek to the start of the file. Use this
flag with extreme care. <br>
It can only be used on devices where an lseek does not
rewind the tape but does reset the kernels position flags.
It is used to allow more than 2 gigabytes to be written.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Print debug information to
stderr during operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sizes are a number with an
optional trailing character. A &rsquo;b&rsquo; multiplies
the size by 512, a &rsquo;k&rsquo; by 1024 and an
&rsquo;m&rsquo; by a meg.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Buffer reads from standard input reblocking to the given
blocksize and writes each block to standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Internally buffer is a pair of
processes communicating via a large circular queue held in
shared memory. The reader process only has to block when the
queue is full and the <br>
writer process when the queue is empty. Buffer is designed
to try and keep the writer side continuously busy so that it
can stream when writing to tape drives. When used to <br>
write tapes with an intervening network buffer can result in
a considerable increase in throughput.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default settings for buffer
are normally good enough. If you are a heavy tape user then
it is worth your while trying out various different
combinations of options. In par&acirc; <br>
ticular running a buffer at both ends of the pipe can
provide a substantial increase (see last example below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
$ buffer &lt; /etc/termcap &gt; /dev/rst8</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ tar cf - . | rsh somehost
&rsquo;buffer &gt; /dev/rst8&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ dump fu - | rsh somehost
&rsquo;buffer -s 16k &gt; /dev/nrst8&rsquo; <br>
$ tar cf - . | buffer | <br>
rsh somehost &rsquo;buffer -S 500K -p 75 &gt;
/dev/rst0&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUFFER LIMITS <br>
There are 2 limits in buffer affecting the maximum total
buffer size: The maximum number of blocks (2048) and the
maximum size of a block (512kB). This results in a maximum
total <br>
buffer size of 1GB.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that there is also a kernel
limit for the maximum size of a shared memory segment (used
by buffer internally) which is typically much lower than the
limits in buffer. So if <br>
buffer complains about not being able to create a shared
memory segment, this limit might have to be raised using the
command sysctl kernel.shmmax=XXX (see also sysctl(1) and
<br>
proc(5)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Internally, for printing purposes, buffer counts in terms of
the number of kilobytes output. If the blocksize you use is
not a whole number of kilobytes then the numbers printed
<br>
will be inaccurate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THANKS <br>
Thanks to Kevin Twidle &lt;kpt@doc.ic.ac.uk&gt; for a lot of
early suggestions and patches to make it work with
non-tar/dump tapes to exabyte drives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Thanks to Andi Karrer
&lt;karrer@bernina.ethz.ch&gt;, Rumi Zahir
&lt;rumi@iis.ethz.ch&gt; and Christoph Wicki
&lt;wicki@iis.ethz.ch&gt; for patches to make buffer work
when trying to write single <br>
tape files of greater than 2 gigabytes.</p>
