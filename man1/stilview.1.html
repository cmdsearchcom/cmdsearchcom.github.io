<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
stilview - command-line program to help you retrieve the
entries stored in STIL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
stilview [-b] [-d] [-e entry] [-f field] [-i] [-l HVSC base
dir] [-m] <br>
[-o] [-s] [-t tune number]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">stilview {[-h] | [-v]}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
STILView is a command-line driven program to help you
retrieve the entries stored in STIL fast and accurately.
STILView uses the STIL C++ class heavily to do this, and in
fact, <br>
the primary purpose of this command-line program is to test
that class (which is, BTW, used in many GUI-based SID
players, most notably in SIDPlay for Windows and XSIDPLAY
for <br>
Unix systems). However, it is user-friendly enough to be
used by non-programmers, too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GLOSSARY <br>
Some terms and STIL-related lingo in alphabetical order:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUG ENTRY <br>
There exists a special file in HVSC (/DOCUMENTS/BUGlist.txt)
that lists all known bugs in SID tunes in HVSC. See the top
of that file for details about what&rsquo;s in it exactly.
<br>
A BUG entry is like a STIL entry, but it is contained in
this BUGlist.txt file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FIELD <br>
The smallest piece of information in a STIL entry. Currently
valid field names are NAME, TITLE, ARTIST and COMMENT.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILE-GLOBAL COMMENT <br>
A special COMMENT field in a STIL entry for a multi-tune SID
file that refers to the whole SID, not just one tune in it.
These usually contain general information about the <br>
SID file itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/Hubbard_Rob/Gerry_the_Germ.sid
<br>
COMMENT: In Rob&rsquo;s own demo of this music, the tunes
are named after the levels <br>
in the original game. <br>
(#1) <br>
TITLE: Lungs <br>
(#2) <br>
TITLE: Kidney <br>
(#7) <br>
TITLE: End</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HVSC <br>
High Voltage SID Collection. If you don&rsquo;t know what
this is, you downloaded the wrong program. :)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HVSC-RELATIVE PATHNAME <br>
The pathname plus filename of a SID file that can be found
in your HVSC, relative to the base directory of HVSC. It is
always in UNIX-style format, eg.: <br>
/Hubbard_Rob/Commando.sid refers to Rob Hubbard&rsquo;s
Commando.sid file within HVSC (which may actually be found
as C:sicCbard_Rob.sid on your Windows PC).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MULTI-TUNE ENTRY <br>
A STIL entry that is referring to a SID file that has many
tunes in it. Each tune might have its own STIL block, which
are separated by a so-called tune designation in the <br>
form of &quot;(#x)&quot;, where x = the tune number. Consult
the STIL.FAQ in HVSC for a detailed description.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/Hubbard_Rob/Gerry_the_Germ.sid
<br>
COMMENT: In Rob&rsquo;s own demo of this music, the tunes
are named after the levels <br>
in the original game. <br>
(#1) <br>
TITLE: Lungs <br>
(#2) <br>
TITLE: Kidney <br>
(#7) <br>
TITLE: End</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SECTION <br>
A part of STIL that belongs to one composer (ie. every STIL
entry referring to SID files that are in one subdirectory in
HVSC). Sections in STIL are always separated by a <br>
line in the form of: &quot;### Composer&rsquo;s name
########&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SECTION-GLOBAL COMMENT <br>
A special STIL entry that refers not to an individual SID
file, but to a whole subdirectory. These usually contain
info about the composer himself, or about all the SID file
<br>
he/she ever composed, and are always indexed in the form of
&quot;/Subdir/&quot; (note the trailing slash!).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/Hubbard_Rob/ <br>
COMMENT: All of these tunes have been confirmed by Hubbard
to be his. People <br>
have often stolen Hubbard&rsquo;s routine causing some tunes
to be falsely <br>
credited to him. <br>
Hubbard&rsquo;s own comments are denoted by (RH).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SINGLE-TUNE ENTRY <br>
A STIL entry that has no tune designation in it in the form
of &quot;(#x)&quot;, where x is a number. (Note, that a
single-tune entry might still refer to a SID file which has
many <br>
tunes in it, ie. when a single-tune entry has nothing but a
COMMENT field in it!)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/Hubbard_Rob/Chain_Reaction.sid
<br>
TITLE: Zoolook (remix) [from Zoolook] <br>
ARTIST: Jean Michel Jarre</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another example (the SID this is
refering to has many tunes in it!):</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">/Barrett_Steve/Magic_Land_Dizzy.sid
<br>
COMMENT: Also used in the game &quot;Wacky Darts&quot; (c)
1990 Codemasters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STIL <br>
SID Tune Information List, essentially a text-file database
that can be found in your HVSC in the /DOCUMENTS/
subdirectory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STIL ENTRY <br>
All of the pieces of information in STIL relating to one SID
file of the HVSC. They are always indexed by the
HVSC-relative pathname.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TUNE <br>
One of the compositions in a SID. Most SID files have only
one tune in them, but many have more than one (eg. one for
the title score of the game, and one for the hi-score <br>
music).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-b Do not print BUG entries Default value: Not specified
(ie. do print BUG entries)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example: &quot;stilview
-e=/Hubbard_Rob/Commando.sid -b&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When this option is specified,
BUG entries will not be printed for the given SID tune. At a
minimum, the -e option has to be specified for this option
to work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Default value: Not specified
(ie. debug mode is off)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example: &quot;stilview
-e=/Hubbard_Rob/Commando.sid -d&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Turns on debug mode in STILView.
This will result in an extensive output, with the debugging
messages going to STDERR. If you encounter any problem or
strange behavior with <br>
STILView, run STILView with the exact same options as you
did when you encountered the problem, with this -d option
added to them. Capture the complete output of this run, <br>
and send it to me with a detailed explanation of the problem
(see email address at the top of this file).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e=entry <br>
Default: NONE (you have to give an HVSC-relative pathname to
this option)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example #1: &quot;stilview
-e=/Hubbard_Rob/Commando.sid&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example #2: &quot;stilview
-e=/Hubbard_Rob/&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is where you specify the
STIL entry you are looking for, given as an HVSC-relative
pathname. If there exists no STIL entry for the given
filename, STILView will print <br>
out nothing. Otherwise, you&rsquo;ll get the STIL entry (or
parts of it, as you may have specified it by other options).
HVSC-relative pathnames are case-insensitive, so <br>
/HUBBARD_ROB/Commando.sid is the same as
/Hubbard_Rob/Commando.sid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example #1 is the most frequent
way of retrieving STIL entries, and it will return all of
the STIL entry for Commando.sid, as well as the
section-global comment for <br>
/Hubbard_Rob/. Example #2 is another valid thing to do: this
will return only the section-global comment for
/Hubbard_Rob/.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Default: NONE Example:
stilview -h</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Prints a brief help screen
listing the available options. All other options that are
also specified on the command-line are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f=field <br>
Default: all</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Valid values for &lt;field&gt;
are: all, name, author, title, artist, comment</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example #1: &quot;stilview -l
-e=/Hubbard_Rob/Delta.sid -f=comment&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example #2: &quot;stilview -l
-e=/Hubbard_Rob/Delta.sid -t=1 -f=title&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example #3: &quot;stilview -l
-e=/Hubbard_Rob/Delta.sid -t=12 -f=all -s -b&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Asks for one particular field in
a STIL entry. Combined with the -t option, these two options
can retrieve any portion of a STIL entry, including a single
field in a specific <br>
subtune&rsquo;s entry. Below is full and complete
explanation of what the different possible combinations of
the -t and -f options retrieve:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;-t=0 -f=all&quot; : All of
the STIL entry is printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;-t=0 -f=comment&quot; :
The file-global comment is printed. For single-tune entries
that have nothing but a COMMENT field in them, this prints
that COMMENT. For single-tune <br>
entries that have other fields in them, this prints nothing.
(This is because single-tune entries with nothing but a
COMMENT field are assumed to be file-global comments.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;-t=0
-f=&lt;name/author/title/artist&gt;&quot; : Nothing is
printed. This combination of these options is invalid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;-t=&lt;x&gt; -f=all&quot;
: (Where x is anything but 0.) All fields from the portion
of the STIL entry for the given tune number &lt;x&gt; are
printed. For single-tune entries, asking for <br>
-t=1 -f=all is equivalent to saying -t=0 -f=all, since by
definition, the whole entry refers to only one tune.
(However, specifying -t with any other number than 1 will
print <br>
nothing!) Note that if there&rsquo;s a file-global comment
in the STIL entry (which also means that if a single-tune
entry has nothing but a COMMENT field in it), that is not
<br>
printed with these combinations of options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;-t=&lt;x&gt;
-f=&lt;name/author/title/artist/comment&gt;&quot; : (Where x
is anything but 0.) The specific field from the portion of
the STIL entry for the given tune number is printed. For
<br>
single-tune entries that have nothing but a COMMENT in them,
this returns nothing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Of course, if the STIL entry or
any portion of it asked with these options does not exist,
STILView will print nothing. Also, unless otherwise
specified with the -o, -s and <br>
-b options, the section-global comment and the BUG entry of
the given SID file will also get printed (provided they
exist).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In example #1, the file-global
comment for /Hubbard_Rob/Delta.sid is printed, since -t is
not specified and is assumed to be 0. Also printed are the
section- global comment <br>
and the BUG entry for the same SID file (if they exist). In
example #2, the TITLE field of the STIL entry for tune #1 of
/Hubbard_Rob/Delta.sid is printed along with the <br>
section-global comment and the BUG entry for the same SID
file (if they exist). In example #3, all of the STIL entry
for tune #12 of /Hubbard_Rob/Delta.sid is printed, but <br>
nothing else.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i Default: NONE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example: &quot;stilview
-i&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Starts STILView in interactive
mode, ignoring all other options specified on the
command-line, except -l, -d and -m. In interactive mode, you
can look for STIL entries by <br>
typing them in. You will get prompted for the desired STIL
entry (which has to be specified with an HVSC-relative
pathname), for the tune number requested (which should be
<br>
any non-negative number, but this is not enforced), and
finally for the specific STIL field you want to
retrieve.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l=HVSC base dir <br>
Default: The value of the HVSC_BASE environment variable</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example #1: &quot;stilview
-l=C:sicC&nbsp;-e=/Hubbard_Rob/Commando.sid&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example #2: &quot;stilview
-l=../HVSC/ =-e=/Hubbard_Rob/Commando.sid&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example #3: &quot;stilview -l
-e=/Hubbard_Rob/Commando.sid&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is where you tell STILView
where it can find the HVSC base directory (the path to the
directory has to be specified in the form required by your
operating system, eg. <br>
C:sicC under Windows, /home/lala/HVSC under UNIX). STILView
will then try to locate the STIL.txt file in the /DOCUMENTS/
subdirectory of that directory. If this option <br>
is not specified (or if -l is specified without a base
directory), STILView will try to extract the path of the
HVSC base directory from the HVSC_BASE environment variable.
<br>
If that environment variable doesn&rsquo;t exist or is
pointing to a location where there&rsquo;s no STIL.txt file
in a DOCUMENTS directory, STILView fails. If the HVSC_BASE
environment <br>
variable exists and is valid, and this option is specified,
the directory specified with this option is used as the HVSC
base directory instead of the environment variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In example #1 the HVSC base
directory is located in C:sicC&nbsp;on the hard drive of a
Windows PC, in example #2 it is located in the HVSC
directory of the current <br>
directory&rsquo;s parent directory of a UNIX system. In
example #3 the HVSC base directory is not specified with the
option, so it is assumed that the HVSC_BASE environment <br>
variable contains the path to it. In reality, specifying the
-l option in example #3 is redundant, and can be
omitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m Demo mode</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default: NONE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example #1: &quot;stilview
-m&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example #2: &quot;stilview
-e=/Hubbard_Rob/Commando.sid -m -i&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When specified, it prints out a
whole bunch of things that a) test most of the functionality
of STILView, and b) show what STILView is capable of
retrieving from STIL. In <br>
example #1, the demo is printed with the STIL info coming
from a default STIL entry, then STILView quits. In example
#2, the demo is printed taking the STIL info from the <br>
specified STIL entry of /Hubbard_Rob/Commando.sid (instead
of the default SID file), then interactive mode is
entered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o Do not print STIL entries</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default value: Not specified
(ie. do print STIL entries)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example #1: &quot;stilview
-e=/Hubbard_Rob/Delta.sid -o&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example #2: &quot;stilview
-e=/Hubbard_Rob/Delta.sid -o -s&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When this option is specified,
STIL entries will not be printed for the given SID tune (but
section-global entries and BUG entries will be printed,
provided they exist and <br>
other options did not turn their output off). At a minimum,
the -e option has to be specified for this option to work.
Example #1 will print out the section-global comment <br>
and the BUG entry for /Hubbard_Rob/Delta.sid, example #2
will print out just the section-global comment for the same
SID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Do not print section-global
comments</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default value: Not specified
(ie. do print section-global entries)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example: &quot;stilview
-e=/Hubbard_Rob/Delta.sid -s&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When this option is specified,
section-global entries will not be printed for the given SID
tune. At a minimum, the -e option has to be specified for
this option to work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t=tune number <br>
Default value: 0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example #1: &quot;stilview
-e=/Hubbard_Rob/Commando.sid -t=0&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example #2: &quot;stilview
-e=/Hubbard_Rob/Delta.sid -t=1 -f=title -s -b&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example #3: &quot;stilview
-e=/Hubbard_Rob/Delta.sid -t=12&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Asks for the portion of a STIL
entry referring to one particular tune. If tune number 0 is
given, it retrieves all of the entry. Combined with the -f
option, these two <br>
options can retrieve any portion of a STIL entry, including
a single field in a specific subtune&rsquo;s entry.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For further details about this
option, see the explanation of the -f option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example #1 retrieves all of the
STIL entry for /Hubbard_Rob/Commando.sid, including the
section-global comment and the BUG entry (if any), but since
the default value for <br>
this option is 0, it might as well be omitted in this
example. Example #2 retrieves only the TITLE field of the
first subtune&rsquo;s entry for /Hubbard_Rob/Delta.sid (and
not the <br>
section- global comment or the BUG entry), while example #3
retrieves all of the STIL entry for tune #12 of the same SID
file (including the section-global comment and the <br>
BUG entry, if any).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Print version numbers</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default value: Not specified
(ie. do *not* print version numbers)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example #1: &quot;stilview
-v&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example #2: &quot;stilview
-e=/Hubbard_Rob/Commando.sid -v&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When this option is specified,
the version number of the STILView program and the version
number of the STIL.txt file used by it is printed out. In
example #1 this is the <br>
only piece of info that gets printed on the screen, in
example #2 the version numbers are printed out, then the
STIL entry for /Hubbard_Rob/Commando.sid is also printed
out.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
HVSC_BASE <br>
Specifies the location of the HVSC base directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
All of the examples below assume that the HVSC_BASE
environment is set to a valid HVSC base directory (where the
$HVSC_BASE/DOCUMENTS/STIL.txt and <br>
$HVSC_BASE/DOCUMENTS/BUGlist.txt files exist), and the
examples also assume the presence of the following entries
in these files:</p>

- it was my idea of giving them what I thought they wanted,
a simple <br>
cute tune.....&quot; (RH) <br>
$&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also note that single-tune
entries have only one tune, so asking for the STIL entry of
tune #3 is pointless:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$&gt; stilview
-e=/Hubbard_Rob/International_Karate.sid -t=3 -s -b <br>
$&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Print out the file-global
comment for the given SID file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$&gt; stilview
-e=/Hubbard_Rob/Delta.sid -t=0 -f=comment -s -b <br>
COMMENT: According to Hubbard, Kentilla and Delta were the
most complicated one <br>
to compose, they took the longest time to do and they both
drove him <br>
insane. <br>
$&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Print out the ARTIST field of
tune #12 of the given SID file, plus print out everything
else related to the SID file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$&gt; stilview
-e=/Hubbard_Rob/Delta.sid -t=12 -f=artist <br>
---- GLOBAL COMMENT ---- <br>
COMMENT: All of these tunes have been confirmed by Hubbard
to be his. People <br>
have often stolen Hubbard&rsquo;s routine causing some tunes
to be falsely <br>
credited to him. <br>
------ STIL ENTRY ------ <br>
ARTIST: Philip Glass <br>
---------- BUG ---------- <br>
BUG: Demo entry. <br>
$&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the current version of
STILView is capable to retrieve only the first specified
field of a tune that covers multiple songs! See below:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$&gt; stilview
-e=/Hubbard_Rob/Rasputin.sid -t=1 -f=title -s <br>
TITLE: Katjusha (0:07-0:36) <br>
$&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Section-global comments are
printed out even if the STIL entry for the given SID file
does not exist:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$&gt; stilview
-e=/Hubbard_Rob/This_doesnt_exist.sid <br>
COMMENT: All of these tunes have been confirmed by Hubbard
to be his. People <br>
have often stolen Hubbard&rsquo;s routine causing some tunes
to be falsely <br>
credited to him. <br>
$&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following 4 steps depict how
to have STILView print out everything related to a given SID
file&rsquo;s given tune number one by one:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1) This prints out just the
section-global comment:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$&gt; stilview
-e=/Hubbard_Rob/Delta.sid -o -b <br>
COMMENT: All of these tunes have been confirmed by Hubbard

file-global comment:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$&gt; stilview

COMMENT: According to Hubbard, Kentilla and Delta were the

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3) This prints out all of the
STIL entry for the given tune number:</p>

TITLE: Koyaanisqatsi [from the movie] <br>
ARTIST: Philip Glass <br>
COMMENT: &quot;Inspired by Philip Glass and Pink
Floyd.&quot; (RH) <br>
$&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4) And this prints out just the
BUG entry for the same tune number:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$&gt; stilview
-e=/Hubbard_Rob/Delta.sid -t=12 -s -o <br>
BUG: Demo entry. <br>
$&gt;</p>

COMMENT: &quot;[...] The Delta music loader and ingame music
was Gary Liddon&rsquo;s idea. <br>
[...] He was the producer at Thalamus at the time. He told
Rob Hubbard <br>
to make the ingame music like the 2nd track from Dark Side
of the Moon <br>
by Pink Floyd.&quot; (Info from Matt Furniss.) <br>
&quot;The small jingles are all small clips from Sanxion and
Romeo/Juliet <br>
music. They were all supposed to be for short stingers such
as end of <br>
level, extra life etc...&quot; <br>
&quot;Delta was based on this minimalist composition
technique inspired by <br>
Glass and a bit of Pink Floyd. It was quite hard too do and
required <br>
some custom code to the driver to do it. The music was
tedious to <br>
debug. The other Delta stuff was more conventional - I quite
liked the <br>
other tunes. Delta was spread over a 2 week
period.....&quot; (RH) <br>
According to Hubbard, Kentilla and Delta were the most
complicated one <br>
to compose, they took the longest time to do and they both
drove him <br>
insane. <br>
(#1) <br>
TITLE: On the Run [from the Dark Side of the Moon] <br>
ARTIST: Pink Floyd <br>
COMMENT: It is more inspired by it than a remix of it. <br>
(#12) <br>
TITLE: Koyaanisqatsi [from the movie] <br>
ARTIST: Philip Glass <br>
COMMENT: &quot;Inspired by Philip Glass and Pink
Floyd.&quot; (RH) <br>
$&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3) And this prints out all of
the BUG entry:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$&gt; stilview
-e=/Hubbard_Rob/Delta.sid -s -o <br>
(#12) <br>
BUG: Demo entry. <br>
