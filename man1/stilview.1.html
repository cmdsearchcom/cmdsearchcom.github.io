<b>STILView</b> is a command-line driven program to help you retrieve the
  entries stored in STIL fast and accurately. STILView uses the STIL C++ class
  heavily to do this, and in fact, the primary purpose of this command-line
  program is to test that class (which is, BTW, used in many GUI-based SID
  players, most notably in SIDPlay for Windows and XSIDPLAY for Unix systems).
  However, it is user-friendly enough to be used by non-programmers, too.

      or strange behavior with STILView, run STILView with the exact same
      options as you did when you encountered the problem, with this -d option
      added to them. Capture the complete output of this run, and send it to me

    Example #1: &quot;stilview -e=/Hubbard_Rob/Commando.sid&quot;

    Example #2: &quot;stilview -e=/Hubbard_Rob/&quot;

    This is where you specify the STIL entry you are looking for, given as an

      entry (or parts of it, as you may have specified it by other options).
      HVSC-relative pathnames are case-insensitive, so /HUBBARD_ROB/Commando.sid
      is the same as /Hubbard_Rob/Commando.sid.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Example #1 is the most frequent way of retrieving STIL entries, and it will
      return all of the STIL entry for Commando.sid, as well as the

    Example #1: &quot;stilview -l -e=/Hubbard_Rob/Delta.sid -f=comment&quot;

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Asks for one particular field in a STIL entry. Combined with the -t option,
      these two options can retrieve any portion of a STIL entry, including a
      single field in a specific subtune's entry. Below is full and complete
      explanation of what the different possible combinations of the -t and -f
      options retrieve:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    &quot;-t=0 -f=all&quot; : All of the STIL entry is printed.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    &quot;-t=0 -f=comment&quot; : The file-global comment is printed. For
      single-tune entries that have nothing but a COMMENT field in them, this
      prints that COMMENT. For single-tune entries that have other fields in
      them, this prints nothing. (This is because single-tune entries with
      nothing but a COMMENT field are assumed to be file-global comments.)
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    &quot;-t=0 -f=&lt;name/author/title/artist&gt;&quot; : Nothing is printed.
      This combination of these options is invalid.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    &quot;-t=&lt;x&gt; -f=all&quot; : (Where x is anything but 0.) All fields
      from the portion of the STIL entry for the given tune number &lt;x&gt; are
      printed. For single-tune entries, asking for -t=1 -f=all is equivalent to
      saying -t=0 -f=all, since by definition, the whole entry refers to only
      one tune. (However, specifying -t with any other number than 1 will print
      nothing!) Note that if there's a file-global comment in the STIL entry
      (which also means that if a single-tune entry has nothing but a COMMENT
      field in it), that is <b>not</b> printed with these combinations of
      options.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    &quot;-t=&lt;x&gt; -f=&lt;name/author/title/artist/comment&gt;&quot; :
      (Where x is anything but 0.) The specific field from the portion of the
      STIL entry for the given tune number is printed. For single-tune entries
      that have nothing but a COMMENT in them, this returns nothing.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Of course, if the STIL entry or any portion of it asked with these options
      does not exist, STILView will print nothing. Also, unless otherwise
      specified with the -o, -s and -b options, the section-global comment and
      the BUG entry of the given SID file will also get printed (provided they
      exist).
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    In example #1, the file-global comment for /Hubbard_Rob/Delta.sid is
      printed, since -t is not specified and is assumed to be 0. Also printed
      are the section- global comment and the BUG entry for the same SID file
      (if they exist). In example #2, the TITLE field of the STIL entry for tune
      #1 of /Hubbard_Rob/Delta.sid is printed along with the section-global
      comment and the BUG entry for the same SID file (if they exist). In
      example #3, all of the STIL entry for tune #12 of /Hubbard_Rob/Delta.sid
      is printed, but nothing else.</dd>

    Starts STILView in interactive mode, ignoring all other options specified on
      the command-line, except -l, -d and -m. In interactive mode, you can look
      for STIL entries by typing them in. You will get prompted for the desired
      STIL entry (which has to be specified with an HVSC-relative pathname), for
      the tune number requested (which should be any non-negative number, but
      this is not enforced), and finally for the specific STIL field you want to
      retrieve.</dd>

  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-l</b>=<i>HVSC base dir</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Default: The value of the HVSC_BASE environment variable
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Example #1: &quot;stilview -l=C:\Music\HVSC\
      -e=/Hubbard_Rob/Commando.sid&quot;
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Example #2: &quot;stilview -l=../HVSC/ =-e=/Hubbard_Rob/Commando.sid&quot;

    Example #3: &quot;stilview -l -e=/Hubbard_Rob/Commando.sid&quot;
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This is where you tell STILView where it can find the HVSC base directory
      (the path to the directory has to be specified in the form required by
      your operating system, eg. C:\Music\HVSC under Windows, /home/lala/HVSC
      under UNIX). STILView will then try to locate the STIL.txt file in the
      /DOCUMENTS/ subdirectory of that directory. If this option is not
      specified (or if -l is specified without a base directory), STILView will
      try to extract the path of the HVSC base directory from the HVSC_BASE
      environment variable. If that environment variable doesn't exist or is
      pointing to a location where there's no STIL.txt file in a DOCUMENTS
      directory, STILView fails. If the HVSC_BASE environment variable exists
      and is valid, and this option is specified, the directory specified with
      this option is used as the HVSC base directory instead of the environment
      variable.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    In example #1 the HVSC base directory is located in C:\Music\HVSC\ on the
      hard drive of a Windows PC, in example #2 it is located in the HVSC
      directory of the current directory's parent directory of a UNIX system. In
      example #3 the HVSC base directory is not specified with the option, so it
      is assumed that the HVSC_BASE environment variable contains the path to
      it. In reality, specifying the -l option in example #3 is redundant, and
      can be omitted.</dd>

    Example #2: &quot;stilview -e=/Hubbard_Rob/Commando.sid -v&quot;

    When this option is specified, the version number of the STILView program
      and the version number of the STIL.txt file used by it is printed out. In
      example #1 this is the only piece of info that gets printed on the screen,
      in example #2 the version numbers are printed out, then the STIL entry for
      /Hubbard_Rob/Commando.sid is also printed out.</dd>

This prints out nothing, as single-tune entries do not have file-global
  comments:

   $&gt; stilview -e=/Hubbard_Rob/International_Karate.sid -t=0 -f=comment -s -b

...Except if the only field in them is a COMMENT (in which case that comment is
  assumed to be a file-global comment):

   $&gt; stilview -e=/Hubbard_Rob/Action_Biker.sid -t=0 -f=comment -s -b

Also note that single-tune entries have only one tune, so asking for the STIL

Section-global comments are printed out even if the STIL entry for the given SID
  file does not exist:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   $&gt; stilview -e=/Hubbard_Rob/This_doesnt_exist.sid
      COMMENT: All of these tunes have been confirmed by Hubbard to be his. People

<div class="Pp"></div>
The following 4 steps depict how to have STILView print out everything related
  to a given SID file's given tune number one by one:
<div class="Pp"></div>
1) This prints out just the section-global comment:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   $&gt; stilview -e=/Hubbard_Rob/Delta.sid -o -b
      COMMENT: All of these tunes have been confirmed by Hubbard to be his. People
               have often stolen Hubbard's routine causing some tunes to be falsely
               credited to him.
   $&gt;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
2) This prints out just the file-global comment:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   $&gt; stilview -e=/Hubbard_Rob/Delta.sid -t=0 -f=comment -s -b
      COMMENT: According to Hubbard, Kentilla and Delta were the most complicated one
               to compose, they took the longest time to do and they both drove him
               insane.
   $&gt;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
3) This prints out all of the STIL entry for the given tune number:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   $&gt; stilview -e=/Hubbard_Rob/Delta.sid -t=12 -f=all -s -b
        TITLE: Koyaanisqatsi [from the movie]
       ARTIST: Philip Glass
      COMMENT: &quot;Inspired by Philip Glass and Pink Floyd.&quot; (RH)
   $&gt;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
4) And this prints out just the BUG entry for the same tune number:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   $&gt; stilview -e=/Hubbard_Rob/Delta.sid -t=12 -s -o
        BUG: Demo entry.
   $&gt;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The following 3 steps depict how to have STILView print out everything related
  to a given SID file:
<div class="Pp"></div>
1) This prints out just the section-global comment:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   $&gt; stilview -e=/Hubbard_Rob/Delta.sid -o -b

      COMMENT: &quot;[...] The Delta music loader and ingame music was Gary Liddon's idea.
               [...] He was the producer at Thalamus at the time. He told Rob Hubbard
               to make the ingame music like the 2nd track from Dark Side of the Moon
               by Pink Floyd.&quot; (Info from Matt Furniss.)
               &quot;The small jingles are all small clips from Sanxion and Romeo/Juliet
               music. They were all supposed to be for short stingers such as end of
               level, extra life etc...&quot;
               &quot;Delta was based on this minimalist composition technique inspired by
               Glass and a bit of Pink Floyd. It was quite hard too do and required
               some custom code to the driver to do it. The music was tedious to
               debug. The other Delta stuff was more conventional - I quite liked the
               other tunes. Delta was spread over a 2 week period.....&quot; (RH)
               According to Hubbard, Kentilla and Delta were the most complicated one
               to compose, they took the longest time to do and they both drove him
               insane.
