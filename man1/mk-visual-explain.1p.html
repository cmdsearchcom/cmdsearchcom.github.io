MK-VISUAL-EXPLAIN(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
mk-visual-explain - Format EXPLAIN output as a tree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
Usage: mk-visual-explain [OPTION...] [FILE...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mk-visual-explain transforms
EXPLAIN output into a tree representation of the query plan.
If FILE is given, input is read from the file(s). With no
FILE, or when FILE is -, <br>
read standard input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mk-visual-explain
&lt;file_containing_explain_output&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mk-visual-explain -c
&lt;file_containing_query&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mysql -e &quot;explain select *
from mysql.user&quot; | mk-visual-explain</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RISKS <br>
The following section is included to inform users about the
potential risks, whether known or unknown, of using this
tool. The two main categories of risks are those created by
<br>
the nature of the tool (e.g. read-only tools vs. read-write
tools) and those created by bugs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mk-visual-explain is read-only
and very low-risk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At the time of this release, we
know of no bugs that could cause serious harm to users.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The authoritative source for
updated information is always the online issue tracking
system. Issues that affect this tool will be marked as such.
You can see a list of such <br>
issues at the following URL:
&lt;http://www.maatkit.org/bugs/mk-visual-explain&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See also &quot;BUGS&quot; for
more information on filing bugs and getting help.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
mk-visual-explain reverse-engineers MySQL&rsquo;s EXPLAIN
output into a query execution plan, which it then formats as
a left-deep tree -- the same way the plan is represented
inside <br>
MySQL. It is possible to do this by hand, or to read
EXPLAIN&rsquo;s output directly, but it requires patience
and expertise. Many people find a tree representation more
<br>
understandable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can pipe input into
mk-visual-explain or specify a filename at the command line,
including the magical &rsquo;-&rsquo; filename, which will
read from standard input. It can do two <br>
things with the input: parse it for something that looks
like EXPLAIN output, or connect to a MySQL instance and run
EXPLAIN on the input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When parsing its input,
mk-visual-explain understands three formats: tabular like
that shown in the mysql command-line client, vertical like
that created by using the G line <br>
terminator in the mysql command-line client, and tab
separated. It ignores any lines it doesn&rsquo;t know how to
parse.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When executing the input,
mk-visual-explain replaces everything in the input up to the
first SELECT keyword with &rsquo;EXPLAIN SELECT,&rsquo; and
then executes the result. You must specify <br>
&quot;--connect&quot; to execute the input as a query.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Either way, it builds a tree
from the result set and prints it to standard output. For
the following query,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">select * from sakila.film_actor
join sakila.film using(film_id);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mk-visual-explain generates this
query plan:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">JOIN <br>
+- Bookmark lookup <br>
| +- Table <br>
| | table film_actor <br>
| | possible_keys idx_fk_film_id <br>
| +- Index lookup <br>
| key film_actor-&gt;idx_fk_film_id <br>
| possible_keys idx_fk_film_id <br>
| key_len 2 <br>
| ref sakila.film.film_id <br>
| rows 2 <br>
+- Table scan <br>
rows 952 <br>
+- Table <br>
table film <br>
possible_keys PRIMARY</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The query plan is left-deep,
depth-first search, and the tree&rsquo;s root is the output
node -- the last step in the execution plan. In other words,
read it like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. Table scan the
&rsquo;film&rsquo; table, which accesses an estimated 952
rows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. For each row, find matching
rows by doing an index lookup into the
film_actor-&gt;idx_fk_film_id index with the value from
sakila.film.film_id, then a bookmark lookup into the <br>
film_actor table.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For more information on how to
read EXPLAIN output, please see
&lt;http://dev.mysql.com/doc/en/explain.html&gt;, and this
talk titled &quot;Query Optimizer Internals and What&rsquo;s
New in the <br>
MySQL 5.2 Optimizer,&quot; from Timour Katchaounov, one of
the MySQL developers:
&lt;http://maatkit.org/presentations/katchaounov_timour.pdf&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MODULES <br>
This program is actually a runnable module, not just an
ordinary Perl script. In fact, there are two modules
embedded in it. This makes unit testing easy, but it also
makes it <br>
easy for you to use the parsing and tree-building
functionality if you want.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ExplainParser package
accepts a string and parses whatever it thinks looks like
EXPLAIN output from it. The synopsis is as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">require
&quot;mk-visual-explain&quot;; <br>
my $p = ExplainParser-&gt;new(); <br>
my $rows = $p-&gt;parse(&quot;some text&quot;); <br>
# $rows is an arrayref of hashrefs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ExplainTree package accepts
a set of rows and turns it into a tree. For convenience, you
can also have it delegate to ExplainParser and parse text
for you. Here&rsquo;s the <br>
synopsis:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">require
&quot;mk-visual-explain&quot;; <br>
my $e = ExplainTree-&gt;new(); <br>
my $tree = $e-&gt;parse(&quot;some text&quot;, options);
<br>
my $output = $e-&gt;pretty_print($tree); <br>
print $tree;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ALGORITHM <br>
This section explains the algorithm that converts EXPLAIN
into a tree. You may be interested in reading this if you
want to understand EXPLAIN more fully, or trying to figure
<br>
out how this works, but otherwise this section will probably
not make your life richer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The tree can be built by
examining the id, select_type, and table columns of each
row. Here&rsquo;s what I know about them:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The id column is the sequential
number of the select. This does not indicate nesting; it
just comes from counting SELECT from the left of the SQL
statement. It&rsquo;s like capturing <br>
parentheses in a regular expression. A UNION RESULT row
doesn&rsquo;t have an id, because it isn&rsquo;t a SELECT.
The source code actually refers to UNIONs as a fake_lex, as
I recall.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If two adjacent rows have the
same id value, they are joined with the standard
single-sweep multi-join method.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The select_type column tells a)
that a new sub-scope has opened b) what kind of relationship
the row has to the previous row c) what kind of operation
the row represents.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; SIMPLE means
there are no subqueries or unions in the whole query.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; PRIMARY means
there are, but this is the outermost SELECT.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; [DEPENDENT]
UNION means this result is UNIONed with the previous result
(not row; a result might encompass more than one row).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; UNION RESULT
terminates a set of UNIONed results.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
[DEPENDENT|UNCACHEABLE] SUBQUERY means a new sub-scope is
opening. This is the kind of subquery that happens in a
WHERE clause, SELECT list or whatnot; it does not return a
<br>
so-called &quot;derived table.&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; DERIVED is a
subquery in the FROM clause.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tables that are JOINed all have
the same select_type. For example, if you JOIN three tables
inside a dependent subquery, they&rsquo;ll all say the same
thing: DEPENDENT SUBQUERY.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The table column usually
specifies the table name or alias, but may also say
&lt;derivedN&gt; or &lt;unionN,N...N&gt;. If it says
&lt;derivedN&gt;, the row represents an access to the
temporary <br>
table that holds the result of the subquery whose id is N.
If it says &lt;unionN,..N&gt; it&rsquo;s the same thing, but
it refers to the results it UNIONs together.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, order matters. If a
row&rsquo;s id is less than the one before it, I think that
means it is dependent on something other than the one before
it. For example,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">explain select <br>
(select 1 from sakila.film), <br>
(select 2 from sakila.film_actor), <br>
(select 3 from sakila.actor);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">| id | select_type | table |
<br>
+----+-------------+------------+ <br>
| 1 | PRIMARY | NULL | <br>
| 4 | SUBQUERY | actor | <br>
| 3 | SUBQUERY | film_actor | <br>
| 2 | SUBQUERY | film |</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the results were in order
2-3-4, I think that would mean 3 is a subquery of 2, 4 is a
subquery of 3. As it is, this means 4 is a subquery of the
nearest previous recent row <br>
with a smaller id, which is 1. Likewise for 3 and 2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This structure is hard to
programatically build into a tree for the same reason
it&rsquo;s hard to understand by inspection: there are both
forward and backward references. &lt;derivedN&gt; <br>
is a forward reference to selectN, while &lt;unionM,N&gt; is
a backward reference to selectM and selectN. That makes
recursion and other tree-building algorithms hard to get
right <br>
(NOTE: after implementation, I now see how it would be
possible to deal with both forward and backward references,
but I have no motivation to change something that works).
<br>
Consider the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">select * from ( <br>
select 1 from sakila.actor as actor_1 <br>
union <br>
select 1 from sakila.actor as actor_2 <br>
) as der_1 <br>
union <br>
select * from ( <br>
select 1 from sakila.actor as actor_3 <br>
union all <br>
select 1 from sakila.actor as actor_4 <br>
) as der_2;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">| id | select_type | table |
<br>
+------+--------------+------------+ <br>
| 1 | PRIMARY | &lt;derived2&gt; | <br>
| 2 | DERIVED | actor_1 | <br>
| 3 | UNION | actor_2 | <br>
| NULL | UNION RESULT | &lt;union2,3&gt; | <br>
| 4 | UNION | &lt;derived5&gt; | <br>
| 5 | DERIVED | actor_3 | <br>
| 6 | UNION | actor_4 | <br>
| NULL | UNION RESULT | &lt;union5,6&gt; | <br>
| NULL | UNION RESULT | &lt;union1,4&gt; |</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This would be a lot easier to
work with if it looked like this (I&rsquo;ve bracketed the
id on rows I moved):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">| id | select_type | table |
<br>
+------+--------------+------------+ <br>
| [1] | UNION RESULT | &lt;union1,4&gt; | <br>
| 1 | PRIMARY | &lt;derived2&gt; | <br>
| [2] | UNION RESULT | &lt;union2,3&gt; | <br>
| 2 | DERIVED | actor_1 | <br>
| 3 | UNION | actor_2 | <br>
| 4 | UNION | &lt;derived5&gt; | <br>
| [5] | UNION RESULT | &lt;union5,6&gt; | <br>
| 5 | DERIVED | actor_3 | <br>
| 6 | UNION | actor_4 |</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In fact, why not re-number all
the ids, so the PRIMARY row becomes 2, and so on? That would
make it even easier to read. Unfortunately that would also
have the effect of <br>
destroying the meaning of the id column, which I think is
important to preserve in the final tree. Also, though it
makes it easier to read, it doesn&rsquo;t make it easier to
<br>
manipulate programmatically; so it&rsquo;s fine to leave
them numbered as they are.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The goal of re-ordering is to
make it easier to figure out which rows are children of
which rows in the execution plan. Given the reordered list
and some row whose table is <br>
&lt;union...&gt; or &lt;derived&gt;, it is easy to find the
beginning of the slice of rows that should be child nodes in
the tree: you just look for the first row whose ID is the
same as the <br>
first number in the table.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The next question is how to find
the last row that should be a child node of a UNION or
DERIVED. I&rsquo;ll start with DERIVED, because the solution
makes UNION easy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Consider how MySQL numbers the
SELECTs sequentially according to their position in the SQL,
left-to-right. Since a DERIVED table encloses everything
within it in a scope, which <br>
becomes a temporary table, there are only two things to
think about: its child subqueries and unions (if any), and
its next siblings in the scope that encloses it. Its
children <br>
will all have an id greater than it does, by definition, so
any later rows with a smaller id terminate the scope.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here&rsquo;s an example. The
middle derived table here has a subquery and a UNION to make
it a little more complex for the example.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">explain select 1 <br>
from ( <br>
select film_id from sakila.film limit 1 <br>
) as der_1 <br>
join ( <br>
select film_id, actor_id, (select count(*) from
sakila.rental) as r <br>
from sakila.film_actor limit 1 <br>
union all <br>
select 1, 1, 1 from sakila.film_actor as dummy <br>
) as der_2 using (film_id) <br>
join ( <br>
select actor_id from sakila.actor limit 1 <br>
) as der_3 using (actor_id);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here&rsquo;s the output of
EXPLAIN:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">| id | select_type | table |
<br>
| 1 | PRIMARY | &lt;derived2&gt; | <br>
| 1 | PRIMARY | &lt;derived6&gt; | <br>
| 1 | PRIMARY | &lt;derived3&gt; | <br>
| 6 | DERIVED | actor | <br>
| 3 | DERIVED | film_actor | <br>
| 4 | SUBQUERY | rental | <br>
| 5 | UNION | dummy | <br>
| NULL | UNION RESULT | &lt;union3,5&gt; | <br>
| 2 | DERIVED | film |</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The siblings all have id 1, and
the middle one I care about is derived3. (Notice MySQL
doesn&rsquo;t execute them in the order I defined them,
which is fine). Now notice that MySQL <br>
prints out the rows in the opposite order I defined the
subqueries: 6, 3, 2. It always seems to do this, and there
might be other methods of finding the scope boundaries <br>
including looking for the lower boundary of the next largest
sibling, but this is a good enough heuristic. I am forced to
rely on it for non-DERIVED subqueries, so I rely on it <br>
here too. Therefore, I decide that everything greater than
or equal to 3 belongs to the DERIVED scope.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The rule for UNION is simple:
they consume the entire enclosing scope, and to find the
component parts of each one, you find each part&rsquo;s
beginning as referred to in the <br>
&lt;unionN,...&gt; definition, and its end is either just
before the next one, or if it&rsquo;s the last part, the end
is the end of the scope.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is only simple because
UNION consumes the entire scope, which is either the entire
statement, or the scope of a DERIVED table. This is because
a UNION cannot be a sibling <br>
of another UNION or a table, DERIVED or not. (Try writing
such a statement if you don&rsquo;t see it intuitively).
Therefore, you can just find the enclosing scope&rsquo;s
boundaries, and <br>
the rest is easy. Notice in the example above, the UNION is
over &lt;union3,5&gt;, which includes the row with id 4 --
it includes every row between 3 and 5.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, there are non-derived
subqueries to deal with as well. In this case I can&rsquo;t
look at siblings to find the end of the scope as I did for
DERIVED. I have to trust that <br>
MySQL executes depth-first. Here&rsquo;s an example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">explain <br>
select actor_id, <br>
( <br>
select count(film_id) <br>
+ (select count(*) from sakila.film) <br>
from sakila.film join sakila.film_actor using(film_id) <br>
where exists( <br>
select * from sakila.actor <br>
where sakila.actor.actor_id = sakila.film_actor.actor_id
<br>
) <br>
) <br>
from sakila.actor;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">| id | select_type | table |
<br>
| 1 | PRIMARY | actor | <br>
| 2 | SUBQUERY | film | <br>
| 2 | SUBQUERY | film_actor | <br>
| 4 | DEPENDENT SUBQUERY | actor | <br>
| 3 | SUBQUERY | film |</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order, the tree should be
built like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; See row 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; See row 2.
It&rsquo;s a higher id than 1, so it&rsquo;s a subquery,
along with every other row whose id is greater than 2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Inside this
scope, see 2 and 2 and JOIN them. See 4. It&rsquo;s a higher
id than 2, so it&rsquo;s again a subquery; recurse. After
that, see 3, which is also higher; recurse.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">But the only reason the nested
subquery didn&rsquo;t include select 3 is because select 4
came first. In other words, if EXPLAIN looked like this,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">| id | select_type | table |
<br>
| 1 | PRIMARY | actor | <br>
| 2 | SUBQUERY | film | <br>
| 2 | SUBQUERY | film_actor | <br>
| 3 | SUBQUERY | film | <br>
| 4 | DEPENDENT SUBQUERY | actor |</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">I would be forced to assume upon
seeing select 3 that select 4 is a subquery of it, rather
than just being the next sibling in the enclosing scope. If
this is ever wrong, then <br>
the algorithm is wrong, and I don&rsquo;t see what could be
done about it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UNION is a little more
complicated than just &quot;the entire scope is a
UNION,&quot; because the UNION might itself be inside an
enclosing scope that&rsquo;s only indicated by the first
item <br>
inside the UNION. There are only three kinds of enclosing
scopes: UNION, DERIVED, and SUBQUERY. A UNION can&rsquo;t
enclose a UNION, and a DERIVED has its own &quot;scope
markers,&quot; but a <br>
SUBQUERY can wholly enclose a UNION, like this strange
example on the empty table t1:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">explain select * from t1 where
not exists( <br>
(select t11.i from t1 t11) union (select t12.i from t1
t12));</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">| id | select_type | table |
Extra | <br>

+------+--------------+------------+--------------------------------+
<br>
| 1 | PRIMARY | t1 | const row not found | <br>
| 2 | SUBQUERY | NULL | No tables used | <br>
| 3 | SUBQUERY | NULL | no matching row in const table |
<br>
| 4 | UNION | t12 | const row not found | <br>
| NULL | UNION RESULT | &lt;union2,4&gt; | |</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The UNION&rsquo;s backward
references might make it look like the UNION encloses the
subquery, but studying the query makes it clear this
isn&rsquo;t the case. So when a UNION&rsquo;s first row <br>
says SUBQUERY, it is this special case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By the way, I don&rsquo;t fully
understand this query plan; there are 4 numbered SELECT in
the plan, but only 3 in the query. The parens around the
UNIONs are meaningful. Removing <br>
them will make the EXPLAIN different. Please tell me how and
why this works if you know.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Armed with this knowledge,
it&rsquo;s possible to use recursion to turn the
parent-child relationship between all the rows into a tree
representing the execution plan.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MySQL prints the rows in
execution order, even the forward and backward references.
At any given scope, the rows are processed as a left-deep
tree. MySQL does not do &quot;bushy&quot; <br>
execution plans. It begins with a table, finds a matching
row in the next table, and continues till the last table,
when it emits a row. When it runs out, it backtracks till it
<br>
can find the next row and repeats. There are subtleties of
course, but this is the basic plan. This is why MySQL
transforms all RIGHT OUTER JOINs into LEFT OUTER JOINs and
<br>
cannot do FULL OUTER JOIN.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This means in any given scope,
say</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">| id | select_type | table |
<br>
| 1 | SIMPLE | tbl1 | <br>
| 1 | SIMPLE | tbl2 | <br>
| 1 | SIMPLE | tbl3 |</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The execution plan looks like a
depth-first traversal of this tree:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">JOIN <br>
/ JOIN tbl3 <br>
/ tbl1 tbl2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The JOIN might not be a JOIN. It
might be a subquery, for example. This comes from the type
column of EXPLAIN. The documentation says this is a
&quot;join type,&quot; but I think <br>
&quot;access type&quot; is more accurate, because it&rsquo;s
&quot;how MySQL accesses rows.&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mk-visual-explain decorates the
tree significantly more than just turning rows into nodes.
Each node may get a series of transformations that turn it
into a subtree of more than <br>
one node. For example, an index scan not marked with
&rsquo;Using index&rsquo; must do a bookmark lookup into the
table rows; that is a three-node subtree. However, after the
above node- <br>
ordering and scoping stuff, the rest of the process is
pretty simple.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
This tool accepts additional command-line arguments. Refer
to the &quot;SYNOPSIS&quot; and usage information for
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ask-pass <br>
Prompt for a password when connecting to MySQL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--charset <br>
short form: -A; type: string</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default character set. If the
value is utf8, sets Perl&rsquo;s binmode on STDOUT to utf8,
passes the mysql_enable_utf8 option to DBD::mysql, and runs
SET NAMES UTF8 after <br>
connecting to MySQL. Any other value sets binmode on STDOUT
without the utf8 layer, and runs SET NAMES after connecting
to MySQL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--clustered-pk <br>
Assume that PRIMARY KEY index accesses don&rsquo;t need to
do a bookmark lookup to retrieve rows. This is the case for
InnoDB.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--config <br>
type: Array</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Read this comma-separated list
of config files; if specified, this must be the first option
on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--connect <br>
Treat input as a query, and obtain EXPLAIN output by
connecting to a MySQL instance and running EXPLAIN on the
query. When this option is given, mk-visual-explain uses the
<br>
other connection-specific options such as &quot;--user&quot;
to connect to the MySQL instance. If you have a .my.cnf
file, it will read it, so you may not need to specify any
<br>
connection-specific options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DOWNLOADING <br>
You can download Maatkit from Google Code at
&lt;http://code.google.com/p/maatkit/&gt;, or you can get
any of the tools easily with a command like the
following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wget
http://www.maatkit.org/get/toolname <br>
or <br>
wget http://www.maatkit.org/trunk/toolname</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Where &quot;toolname&quot; can
be replaced with the name (or fragment of a name) of any of
the Maatkit tools. Once downloaded, they&rsquo;re ready to
run; no installation is needed. The first <br>
URL gets the latest released version of the tool, and the
second gets the latest trunk code from Subversion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
The environment variable &quot;MKDEBUG&quot; enables verbose
debugging output in all of the Maatkit tools:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MKDEBUG=1 mk-....</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS <br>
You need Perl, DBI, DBD::mysql, and some core packages that
ought to be installed in any reasonably new version of
Perl.</p>
