mk-visual-explain - Format EXPLAIN output as a tree.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
Usage: mk-visual-explain [OPTION...] [FILE...]
<div class="Pp"></div>
mk-visual-explain transforms EXPLAIN output into a tree representation of the
  query plan. If FILE is given, input is read from the file(s). With no FILE, or
  when FILE is -, read standard input.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Examples:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  mk-visual-explain &lt;file_containing_explain_output&gt;
  mk-visual-explain -c &lt;file_containing_query&gt;
  mysql -e &quot;explain select * from mysql.user&quot; | mk-visual-explain

mk-visual-explain reverse-engineers MySQL's EXPLAIN output into a query
  execution plan, which it then formats as a left-deep tree -- the same way the
  plan is represented inside MySQL. It is possible to do this by hand, or to
  read EXPLAIN's output directly, but it requires patience and expertise. Many
  people find a tree representation more understandable.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can pipe input into mk-visual-explain or specify a filename at the command
  line, including the magical '-' filename, which will read from standard input.
  It can do two things with the input: parse it for something that looks like
  EXPLAIN output, or connect to a MySQL instance and run EXPLAIN on the input.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When parsing its input, mk-visual-explain understands three formats: tabular
  like that shown in the mysql command-line client, vertical like that created
  by using the \G line terminator in the mysql command-line client, and tab
  separated. It ignores any lines it doesn't know how to parse.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When executing the input, mk-visual-explain replaces everything in the input up
  to the first SELECT keyword with 'EXPLAIN SELECT,' and then executes the
  result. You must specify &quot;--connect&quot; to execute the input as a
  query.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Either way, it builds a tree from the result set and prints it to standard
  output. For the following query,
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 select * from sakila.film_actor join sakila.film using(film_id);
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
mk-visual-explain generates this query plan:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 JOIN
 +- Bookmark lookup
 |  +- Table
 |  |  table          film_actor
 |  |  possible_keys  idx_fk_film_id
 |  +- Index lookup
 |     key            film_actor-&gt;idx_fk_film_id
 |     possible_keys  idx_fk_film_id
 |     key_len        2
 |     ref            sakila.film.film_id
 |     rows           2
 +- Table scan
    rows           952
    +- Table
       table          film
       possible_keys  PRIMARY
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The query plan is left-deep, depth-first search, and the tree's root is the
  output node -- the last step in the execution plan. In other words, read it
  like this:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">1.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Table scan the 'film' table, which accesses an estimated
      952 rows.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">2.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">For each row, find matching rows by doing an index lookup
      into the film_actor-&gt;idx_fk_film_id index with the value from
      sakila.film.film_id, then a bookmark lookup into the film_actor
    table.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>

  &lt;http://dev.mysql.com/doc/en/explain.html&gt;, and this talk titled
  &quot;Query Optimizer Internals and What's New in the MySQL 5.2

This program is actually a runnable module, not just an ordinary Perl script. In
  fact, there are two modules embedded in it. This makes unit testing easy, but
  it also makes it easy for you to use the parsing and tree-building
  functionality if you want.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The ExplainParser package accepts a string and parses whatever it thinks looks
  like EXPLAIN output from it. The synopsis is as follows:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 require &quot;mk-visual-explain&quot;;
 my $p    = ExplainParser-&gt;new();
 my $rows = $p-&gt;parse(&quot;some text&quot;);
 # $rows is an arrayref of hashrefs.
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The ExplainTree package accepts a set of rows and turns it into a tree. For
  convenience, you can also have it delegate to ExplainParser and parse text for
  you. Here's the synopsis:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 require &quot;mk-visual-explain&quot;;
 my $e      = ExplainTree-&gt;new();
 my $tree   = $e-&gt;parse(&quot;some text&quot;, \%options);
 my $output = $e-&gt;pretty_print($tree);
 print $tree;
</pre>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ALGORITHM"><a class="selflink" href="#ALGORITHM">ALGORITHM</a></h1>
This section explains the algorithm that converts EXPLAIN into a tree. You may
  be interested in reading this if you want to understand EXPLAIN more fully, or
  trying to figure out how this works, but otherwise this section will probably
  not make your life richer.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The tree can be built by examining the id, select_type, and table columns of
  each row. Here's what I know about them:
<div class="Pp"></div>
The id column is the sequential number of the select. This does not indicate
  nesting; it just comes from counting SELECT from the left of the SQL
  statement. It's like capturing parentheses in a regular expression. A UNION
  RESULT row doesn't have an id, because it isn't a SELECT. The source code
  actually refers to UNIONs as a fake_lex, as I recall.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If two adjacent rows have the same id value, they are joined with the standard
  single-sweep multi-join method.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The select_type column tells a) that a new sub-scope has opened b) what kind of
  relationship the row has to the previous row c) what kind of operation the row
  represents.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">SIMPLE means there are no subqueries or unions in the whole
      query.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">PRIMARY means there are, but this is the outermost
    SELECT.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">[DEPENDENT] UNION means this result is UNIONed with the
      previous result (not row; a result might encompass more than one
    row).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">UNION RESULT terminates a set of UNIONed results.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">[DEPENDENT|UNCACHEABLE] SUBQUERY means a new sub-scope is
      opening. This is the kind of subquery that happens in a WHERE clause,
      SELECT list or whatnot; it does not return a so-called &quot;derived
      table.&quot;</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">DERIVED is a subquery in the FROM clause.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Tables that are JOINed all have the same select_type. For example, if you JOIN
  three tables inside a dependent subquery, they'll all say the same thing:
  DEPENDENT SUBQUERY.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The table column usually specifies the table name or alias, but may also say
  &lt;derivedN&gt; or &lt;unionN,N...N&gt;. If it says &lt;derivedN&gt;, the row
  represents an access to the temporary table that holds the result of the
  subquery whose id is N. If it says &lt;unionN,..N&gt; it's the same thing, but
  it refers to the results it UNIONs together.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Finally, order matters. If a row's id is less than the one before it, I think
  that means it is dependent on something other than the one before it. For
  example,
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 explain select
    (select 1 from sakila.film),
    (select 2 from sakila.film_actor),
    (select 3 from sakila.actor);
 | id | select_type | table      |
 +----+-------------+------------+
 |  1 | PRIMARY     | NULL       |
 |  4 | SUBQUERY    | actor      |
 |  3 | SUBQUERY    | film_actor |
 |  2 | SUBQUERY    | film       |
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the results were in order 2-3-4, I think that would mean 3 is a subquery of
  2, 4 is a subquery of 3. As it is, this means 4 is a subquery of the nearest
  previous recent row with a smaller id, which is 1. Likewise for 3 and 2.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This structure is hard to programatically build into a tree for the same reason
  it's hard to understand by inspection: there are both forward and backward
  references. &lt;derivedN&gt; is a forward reference to selectN, while
  &lt;unionM,N&gt; is a backward reference to selectM and selectN. That makes
  recursion and other tree-building algorithms hard to get right (NOTE: after
  implementation, I now see how it would be possible to deal with both forward
  and backward references, but I have no motivation to change something that
  works). Consider the following:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 select * from (
    select 1 from sakila.actor as actor_1
    union
    select 1 from sakila.actor as actor_2
 ) as der_1
 union
 select * from (
    select 1 from sakila.actor as actor_3
    union all
    select 1 from sakila.actor as actor_4
 ) as der_2;
 | id   | select_type  | table      |
 +------+--------------+------------+
 |  1   | PRIMARY      | &lt;derived2&gt; |
 |  2   | DERIVED      | actor_1    |
 |  3   | UNION        | actor_2    |
 | NULL | UNION RESULT | &lt;union2,3&gt; |
 |  4   | UNION        | &lt;derived5&gt; |
 |  5   | DERIVED      | actor_3    |
 |  6   | UNION        | actor_4    |
 | NULL | UNION RESULT | &lt;union5,6&gt; |
 | NULL | UNION RESULT | &lt;union1,4&gt; |
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This would be a lot easier to work with if it looked like this (I've bracketed
  the id on rows I moved):
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 | id   | select_type  | table      |
 +------+--------------+------------+
 | [1]  | UNION RESULT | &lt;union1,4&gt; |
 |  1   | PRIMARY      | &lt;derived2&gt; |
 | [2]  | UNION RESULT | &lt;union2,3&gt; |
 |  2   | DERIVED      | actor_1    |
 |  3   | UNION        | actor_2    |
 |  4   | UNION        | &lt;derived5&gt; |
 | [5]  | UNION RESULT | &lt;union5,6&gt; |
 |  5   | DERIVED      | actor_3    |
 |  6   | UNION        | actor_4    |
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
In fact, why not re-number all the ids, so the PRIMARY row becomes 2, and so on?
  That would make it even easier to read. Unfortunately that would also have the
  effect of destroying the meaning of the id column, which I think is important
  to preserve in the final tree. Also, though it makes it easier to read, it
  doesn't make it easier to manipulate programmatically; so it's fine to leave
  them numbered as they are.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The goal of re-ordering is to make it easier to figure out which rows are
  children of which rows in the execution plan. Given the reordered list and
  some row whose table is &lt;union...&gt; or &lt;derived&gt;, it is easy to
  find the beginning of the slice of rows that should be child nodes in the
  tree: you just look for the first row whose ID is the same as the first number
  in the table.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The next question is how to find the last row that should be a child node of a
  UNION or DERIVED. I'll start with DERIVED, because the solution makes UNION
  easy.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Consider how MySQL numbers the SELECTs sequentially according to their position
  in the SQL, left-to-right. Since a DERIVED table encloses everything within it
  in a scope, which becomes a temporary table, there are only two things to
  think about: its child subqueries and unions (if any), and its next siblings
  in the scope that encloses it. Its children will all have an id greater than
  it does, by definition, so any later rows with a smaller id terminate the
  scope.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Here's an example. The middle derived table here has a subquery and a UNION to
  make it a little more complex for the example.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 explain select 1
 from (
    select film_id from sakila.film limit 1
 ) as der_1
 join (
    select film_id, actor_id, (select count(*) from sakila.rental) as r
    from sakila.film_actor limit 1
    union all
    select 1, 1, 1 from sakila.film_actor as dummy
 ) as der_2 using (film_id)
 join (
    select actor_id from sakila.actor limit 1
 ) as der_3 using (actor_id);
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Here's the output of EXPLAIN:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 | id   | select_type  | table      |
 |  1   | PRIMARY      | &lt;derived2&gt; |
 |  1   | PRIMARY      | &lt;derived6&gt; |
 |  1   | PRIMARY      | &lt;derived3&gt; |
 |  6   | DERIVED      | actor      |
 |  3   | DERIVED      | film_actor |
 |  4   | SUBQUERY     | rental     |
 |  5   | UNION        | dummy      |
 | NULL | UNION RESULT | &lt;union3,5&gt; |
 |  2   | DERIVED      | film       |
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The siblings all have id 1, and the middle one I care about is derived3. (Notice
  MySQL doesn't execute them in the order I defined them, which is fine). Now
  notice that MySQL prints out the rows in the opposite order I defined the
  subqueries: 6, 3, 2. It always seems to do this, and there might be other
  methods of finding the scope boundaries including looking for the lower
  boundary of the next largest sibling, but this is a good enough heuristic. I
  am forced to rely on it for non-DERIVED subqueries, so I rely on it here too.
  Therefore, I decide that everything greater than or equal to 3 belongs to the
  DERIVED scope.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The rule for UNION is simple: they consume the entire enclosing scope, and to
  find the component parts of each one, you find each part's beginning as
  referred to in the &lt;unionN,...&gt; definition, and its end is either just
  before the next one, or if it's the last part, the end is the end of the
  scope.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This is only simple because UNION consumes the entire scope, which is either the
  entire statement, or the scope of a DERIVED table. This is because a UNION
  cannot be a sibling of another UNION or a table, DERIVED or not. (Try writing
  such a statement if you don't see it intuitively). Therefore, you can just
  find the enclosing scope's boundaries, and the rest is easy. Notice in the
  example above, the UNION is over &lt;union3,5&gt;, which includes the row with
  id 4 -- it includes every row between 3 and 5.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Finally, there are non-derived subqueries to deal with as well. In this case I
  can't look at siblings to find the end of the scope as I did for DERIVED. I
  have to trust that MySQL executes depth-first. Here's an example:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 explain
 select actor_id,
 (
    select count(film_id)
    + (select count(*) from sakila.film)
    from sakila.film join sakila.film_actor using(film_id)
    where exists(
       select * from sakila.actor
       where sakila.actor.actor_id = sakila.film_actor.actor_id
    )
 )
 from sakila.actor;
 | id | select_type        | table      |
 |  1 | PRIMARY            | actor      |
 |  2 | SUBQUERY           | film       |
 |  2 | SUBQUERY           | film_actor |
 |  4 | DEPENDENT SUBQUERY | actor      |
 |  3 | SUBQUERY           | film       |
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
In order, the tree should be built like this:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">See row 1.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">See row 2. It's a higher id than 1, so it's a subquery,
      along with every other row whose id is greater than 2.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Inside this scope, see 2 and 2 and JOIN them. See 4. It's a
      higher id than 2, so it's again a subquery; recurse. After that, see 3,
      which is also higher; recurse.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
But the only reason the nested subquery didn't include select 3 is because
  select 4 came first. In other words, if EXPLAIN looked like this,
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 | id | select_type        | table      |
 |  1 | PRIMARY            | actor      |
 |  2 | SUBQUERY           | film       |
 |  2 | SUBQUERY           | film_actor |
 |  3 | SUBQUERY           | film       |
 |  4 | DEPENDENT SUBQUERY | actor      |
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
I would be forced to assume upon seeing select 3 that select 4 is a subquery of
  it, rather than just being the next sibling in the enclosing scope. If this is
  ever wrong, then the algorithm is wrong, and I don't see what could be done
  about it.
<div class="Pp"></div>
UNION is a little more complicated than just &quot;the entire scope is a
  UNION,&quot; because the UNION might itself be inside an enclosing scope
  that's only indicated by the first item inside the UNION. There are only three
  kinds of enclosing scopes: UNION, DERIVED, and SUBQUERY. A UNION can't enclose
  a UNION, and a DERIVED has its own &quot;scope markers,&quot; but a SUBQUERY
  can wholly enclose a UNION, like this strange example on the empty table t1:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 explain select * from t1 where not exists(
    (select t11.i from t1 t11) union (select t12.i from t1 t12));
 |   id | select_type  | table      | Extra                          |
 +------+--------------+------------+--------------------------------+
 |    1 | PRIMARY      | t1         | const row not found            |
 |    2 | SUBQUERY     | NULL       | No tables used                 |
 |    3 | SUBQUERY     | NULL       | no matching row in const table |
 |    4 | UNION        | t12        | const row not found            |
 | NULL | UNION RESULT | &lt;union2,4&gt; |                                |
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The UNION's backward references might make it look like the UNION encloses the
  subquery, but studying the query makes it clear this isn't the case. So when a
  UNION's first row says SUBQUERY, it is this special case.
<div class="Pp"></div>
By the way, I don't fully understand this query plan; there are 4 numbered
  SELECT in the plan, but only 3 in the query. The parens around the UNIONs are
  meaningful. Removing them will make the EXPLAIN different. Please tell me how
  and why this works if you know.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Armed with this knowledge, it's possible to use recursion to turn the
  parent-child relationship between all the rows into a tree representing the
  execution plan.
<div class="Pp"></div>
MySQL prints the rows in execution order, even the forward and backward
  references. At any given scope, the rows are processed as a left-deep tree.
  MySQL does not do &quot;bushy&quot; execution plans. It begins with a table,
  finds a matching row in the next table, and continues till the last table,
  when it emits a row. When it runs out, it backtracks till it can find the next
  row and repeats. There are subtleties of course, but this is the basic plan.
  This is why MySQL transforms all RIGHT OUTER JOINs into LEFT OUTER JOINs and
  cannot do FULL OUTER JOIN.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This means in any given scope, say
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 | id   | select_type  | table      |
 |  1   | SIMPLE       | tbl1       |
 |  1   | SIMPLE       | tbl2       |
 |  1   | SIMPLE       | tbl3       |
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The execution plan looks like a depth-first traversal of this tree:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
       JOIN
      /    \
    JOIN  tbl3
   /    \
 tbl1   tbl2
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The JOIN might not be a JOIN. It might be a subquery, for example. This comes
  from the type column of EXPLAIN. The documentation says this is a &quot;join
  type,&quot; but I think &quot;access type&quot; is more accurate, because it's
  &quot;how MySQL accesses rows.&quot;
<div class="Pp"></div>
mk-visual-explain decorates the tree significantly more than just turning rows
  into nodes. Each node may get a series of transformations that turn it into a
  subtree of more than one node. For example, an index scan not marked with
  'Using index' must do a bookmark lookup into the table rows; that is a
  three-node subtree. However, after the above node-ordering and scoping stuff,
  the rest of the process is pretty simple.

These DSN options are used to create a DSN. Each option is given like
  &quot;option=value&quot;. The options are case-sensitive, so P and p are not
  the same option. There cannot be whitespace before or after the &quot;=&quot;
  and if the value contains whitespace it must be quoted. DSN options are
  comma-separated. See the maatkit manpage for full details.

You can download Maatkit from Google Code at
  &lt;http://code.google.com/p/maatkit/&gt;, or you can get any of the tools
  easily with a command like the following:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   wget http://www.maatkit.org/get/toolname
   or
   wget http://www.maatkit.org/trunk/toolname
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Where &quot;toolname&quot; can be replaced with the name (or fragment of a name)
  of any of the Maatkit tools. Once downloaded, they're ready to run; no
  installation is needed. The first URL gets the latest released version of the
  tool, and the second gets the latest trunk code from Subversion.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ENVIRONMENT"><a class="selflink" href="#ENVIRONMENT">ENVIRONMENT</a></h1>
The environment variable &quot;MKDEBUG&quot; enables verbose debugging output in
  all of the Maatkit tools:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   MKDEBUG=1 mk-....
</pre>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYSTEM_REQUIREMENTS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYSTEM_REQUIREMENTS">SYSTEM
  REQUIREMENTS</a></h1>
You need Perl, DBI, DBD::mysql, and some core packages that ought to be
  installed in any reasonably new version of Perl.

Please include the complete command-line used to reproduce the problem you are
  seeing, the version of all MySQL servers involved, the complete output of the
  tool when run with &quot;--version&quot;, and if possible, debugging output
  produced by running with the &quot;MKDEBUG=1&quot; environment variable.
