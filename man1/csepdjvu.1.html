<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
csepdjvu - DjVu encoder for separated data files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
csepdjvu [options] [sepfiles]... outputdjvufile</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This program creates a DjVuDocument file outputdjvufile from
separated data files sepfiles. It can read separated data
from the standard input when given a single dash instead
<br>
of the separated data file names. This feature is intended
for pre-processing programs that push separated data into
csepdjvu via a pipe.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each separated data file
represents one or more page images. When the program
arguments specify multiple pages, all the pages are encoded
and saved as a bundled multi-page docu&acirc; <br>
ment. When the program arguments specify a single page, the
page is encoded and saved as a single page file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-d n Specify the resolution information encoded into the
output file expressed in dots per inch. The resolution
information encoded in DjVu files determine how the decoder
<br>
scales the image on a particular display. Meaningful
resolutions range from 25 to 6000. The default value is 300
dpi.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q n,...,n</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q n+...+n <br>
Specify the encoding quality of the IW44 encoded background
layer. The option argument contain several integers (one per
chunk) separated by either commas or pluses. <br>
This option is similar to option -slice of program c44.
Please refer to the c44(1) man page for additional details.
The default quality specification is -q 72,83,93,103.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option does not apply to
uniformly white background that were not specified by the
separated data but are called for by the DjVu specification.
Such background <br>
images always come at the lowest possible resolution and
with a standard quality setting that ensures the color
uniformity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Program csepdjvu interprets
certain comments in the separated file to construct a hidden
text layer in the DjVu file. This layer records the location
of each word for <br>
hiliting purposes. This option reduces the file size by
simply recording the location of each line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Display a brief message
describing each page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-vv Display extensive
informational messages during encoding.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEPARATED DATA FILE FORMAT <br>
Each separated data file contains a concatenation of one or
more separated page images. Each page is logically
represented by a foreground image with a transparent color
and by <br>
a background image visible through the transparent pixels.
The data for each separated page image is the concatenation
of the following data blocks:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* A foreground image encoded
using either the &quot;Color RLE format&quot; or the
&quot;Bitonal RLE format&quot;. These formats are described
later in this section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* An optional background image
encoded as a &quot;Portable Pixmap&quot; ( PPM ). This well
known format is summarized later in this section. The
absence of a background image simply <br>
indicates that a uniformly white background should be
assumed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* An arbitrary number of comment
lines starting with character &quot;#&quot; and terminated
by a linefeed character. Comment lines whose first word
starts with a capital letter have spe&acirc; <br>
cial meanings documented later in this document.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The dimensions (width and
height) of the background image must be obtained by rounding
up the quotient of the foreground image dimensions by an
integer reduction factor ranging <br>
from 1 to 12. Assume, for instance, that the width of the
foreground is 2507 and the reduction factor is 3. The width
of the background image will be the integer ratio <br>
(2507+2)/3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Color RLE format <br>
The Color RLE format is a simple run-length encoding scheme
for color images with a limited number of distinct colors.
The data always begin with a text header composed of the
<br>
two characters &quot;R6&quot;, the number of columns, the
number of rows, and the number of color palette entries. All
numbers are expressed in decimal ASCII. These four items are
sepa&acirc; <br>
rated by blank characters (space, tab, carriage return, or
linefeed) or by comment lines introduced by character
&quot;#&quot;. The last number is followed by exactly one
character which <br>
usually is a linefeed character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The header is followed by the
color palette containing three bytes per color entry. The
bytes represent the red, green, and blue components of the
color.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The palette is followed by a
collection of four bytes integers (most significant bit
first) representing runs of pixels with an identical color.
The twelve upper bits of this <br>
integer indicate the index of the run color in the palette
entry. The twenty lower bits of the integer indicate the run
length. Color indices greater than 0xff0 are reserved. <br>
Color index 0xfff is used for transparent runs. Each row is
represented by a sequence of runs whose lengths add up to
the image width. Rows are encoded starting with the top <br>
row and progressing toward the bottom row.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bitonal RLE format <br>
The Bitonal RLE format is a simple run-length encoding
scheme for bitonal images. The data always begin with a text
header composed of the two characters &quot;R4&quot;, the
number of <br>
columns, and the number of rows. All numbers are expressed
in decimal ASCII. These three items are separated by blank
characters (space, tab, carriage return, or linefeed) or
<br>
by comment lines introduced by character &quot;#&quot;. The
last number is followed by exactly one character which
usually is a linefeed character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The rest of the file encodes a
sequence of numbers representing the lengths of alternating
runs of transparent and black pixels. Lines are encoded
starting with the top line and <br>
progressing toward the bottom line. Each line starts with a
white run. The decoder knows that a line is finished when
the sum of the run lengths for that line is equal to the
<br>
number of columns in the image. Numbers in range 0 to 191
are represented by a single byte in range 0x00 to 0xbf.
Numbers in range 192 to 16383 are represented by a two byte
<br>
sequence: the first byte, in range 0xc0 to 0xff, encodes the
six most significant bits of the number, the second byte
encodes the remaining eight bits of the number. This scheme
<br>
allows for runs of length zero, which are useful when a line
starts with a black pixel, and when a very long run (whose
length exceeds 16383) must be split into smaller runs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Portable Pixmap (PPM) format
<br>
The Portable Pixmap format is a well known format for
representing color images. Check the ppm(1) man page for
complete information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The data always begin with a
text header composed of the two characters &quot;P6&quot;,
the number of columns, the number of rows, and the maximal
value of a color component (usually 255). <br>
All numbers are expressed in decimal ASCII. These three
items are separated by blank characters (space, tab,
carriage return, or linefeed) or by comment lines introduced
by <br>
character &quot;#&quot;. The last number is followed by
exactly one character which usually is a linefeed
character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The rest of the file encodes all
the pixels. Each pixel is represented by three bytes
representing the red, green and blue component of the pixel.
Pixels are ordered in left to <br>
right, top to bottom.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Comments in separated files <br>
Each page is followed by an arbitrary number of comment
lines starting with character &quot;#&quot; and terminated
by a linefeed character. Certain comment lines have special
meanings. In <br>
the following constructs, all the strings are UTF-8 encoded
and represent in the style of Postscript strings, that is,
surrounded with parenthesis and using C-style escape <br>
sequences introduced by a backslash.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* # T px:py dx:dy wxh+x+y
(string) <br>
Such a comment line indicates that the piece of text string
must be associated with an area of size wxh at position x,y
relative to the lower left corner of the page. Inte&acirc;
<br>
gers px, and py represent the position of the current point
on the text baseline before the text was drawn. The drawing
operation then moves the current point by dx, and dy <br>
pixels. When such comments are present, csepdjvu produces a
hidden text layer for the corresponding pages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* # L wxh+x+y (url) <br>
Such a comment line indicates that an hyperlink to url url
should be associated with area of size wxh at position x,y.
When such comments are present, csepdjvu produces pages <br>
with an annotation chunk containing the specified
hyperlinks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* # B count (string) (#pageno)
<br>
Such a comment line provides outline information for the
document. An outline entry entitled string is associated
with page pageno. Integer count indicates how many of the
<br>
following outline entries must be attached to the current
entry as subentries. When such comments are present in the
first page csepdjvu produces an navigation chunk with the
<br>
specified outline.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* # P (string) <br>
Such a comment line provides a title string for the current
page.</p>
