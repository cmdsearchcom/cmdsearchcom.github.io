<p>PMDAPERFEVENT(1) General Commands Manual
PMDAPERFEVENT(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pmdaperfevent - hardware performance counter performance
metrics domain agent (PMDA)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/perfevent/pmdaperfevent [-d domain] [-l
logfile] [-U username] [-i port] [-p] [-u socket] [-6]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
pmdaperfevent is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA)
that configures and reads the hardware performance counters
using the Linux kernel perf_event API.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The perfevent PMDA exports
metrics for hardware performance counters that are
configurable from the Linux kernel perf_event API. The PMDA
uses the libpfm4 library to access the <br>
hardware performance counters so any counters that are
supported in libpfm4 should be available. Also included is
the ability to read the Intel RAPL counters via direct MSR
<br>
access. The PMDA supports automatically loading different
counters for each hardware architecture. A single
configuration file is used to specify the desired counters
for each <br>
hardware performance monitoring unit (PMU). The
configuration file allows different counters to be
programmed on different CPUs and supports round-robin
assignment of uncore <br>
counters needed for some AMD chips.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The PMDA configures the counters
to count events in both user and kernel mode. This means
that the hardware counters are unavailable to use by normal
unprivileged user applica&acirc; <br>
tions when they are in use by the PMDA. The PMDA provides a
mechanism to temporarily disable the system-wide counters in
order to allow normal users to be able to use the
coun&acirc; <br>
ters if they wish. See perfalloc(1) for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that pmdaperfevent is
affected by the value of the kernel.perf_event_paranoid
setting, which can be adjusted by sysctl(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A brief description of the
pmdaperfevent command line options follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d It is absolutely crucial that
the performance metrics domain number specified here is
unique and consistent. That is, domain should be different
for every PMDA on the one <br>
host, and the same domain number should be used for the same
PMDA on all hosts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l Location of the log file. By
default, a log file named perfevent.log is written in the
current directory of pmcd(1) when pmdaperfevent is started,
i.e. $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd. <br>
If the log file cannot be created or is not writable, output
is written to the standard error instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U User account under which to
run the agent. The default is the privileged
&quot;root&quot; account.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i listen on given port number
for connection from pmcd(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p communicate with pmcd(1) via
stdin/stdout</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u expect pmcd(1) to connect on
given unix domain socket</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-6 expect pmcd(1) to connect on
given ipv6 port (number or name)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INSTALLATION <br>
The perfevent PMDA is not activated by default To install
the PMDA, do the following as root:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/perfevent
<br>
# ./Install</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to undo the
installation, do the following as root:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/perfevent
<br>
# ./Remove</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pmdaperfevent is launched by
pmcd(1) and should never be executed directly. The Install
and Remove scripts notify pmcd(1) when the agent is
installed or removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
$PCP_PMCDCONF_PATH <br>
command line options used to launch pmdaperfevent <br>
$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/perfevent/perfevent.conf <br>
default configuration file for the PMDA. See
perfevent.conf(5) for detailed information. <br>
$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/perfevent/help <br>
default help text file for the perfevent metrics <br>
$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/perfevent/Install <br>
installation script for the pmdaperfevent agent <br>
$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/perfevent/Remove <br>
undo installation script for the pmdaperfevent agent <br>
$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/perfevent.log <br>
default log file for error messages and other information
from pmdaperfevent</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UPGRADING <br>
Some metric names have changed starting in version 3.10.8 to
better conform to PMNS conventions. pmlogrewrite(1) can be
used to update old archives. A helper utility, <br>
$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/perfevent/perfevent-makerewrite.pl will
generate a config file that is suitable for use with
pmlogrewrite(1) to update the metric names in existing
archives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Each event is placed in its own group and there is no way to
group related events together so they are guaranteed to be
simultaneously active. A workaround for this is to ensure
<br>
that the number of configured events is less than or equal
to the number of available hardware counters. This means
that the events will not be time-multiplexed by the kernel
<br>
and will be simultaneously active.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PCP ENVIRONMENT <br>
Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP. On
each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local
<br>
values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF variable may be
used to specify an alternative configuration file, as
described in pcp.conf(5).</p>
