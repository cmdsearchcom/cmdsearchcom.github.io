<p>ZSHCALSYS(1) General Commands Manual ZSHCALSYS(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
zshcalsys - zsh calendar system</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The shell is supplied with a series of functions to replace
and enhance the traditional Unix calendar programme, which
warns the user of imminent or future events, details of <br>
which are stored in a text file (typically calendar in the
user&rsquo;s home directory). The version provided here
includes a mechanism for alerting the user when an event is
due.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition a function age is
provided that can be used in a glob qualifier; it allows
files to be selected based on their modification times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The format of the calendar file
and the dates used there in and in the age function are
described first, then the functions that can be called to
examine and modify the calendar <br>
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The functions here depend on the
availability of the zsh/datetime module which is usually
installed with the shell. The library function strptime()
must be available; it is <br>
present on most recent operating systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILE AND DATE FORMATS <br>
Calendar File Format <br>
The calendar file is by default ~/calendar. This can be
configured by the calendar-file style, see the section
STYLES below. The basic format consists of a series of
separate <br>
lines, with no indentation, each including a date and time
specification followed by a description of the event.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Various enhancements to this
format are supported, based on the syntax of Emacs calendar
mode. An indented line indicates a continuation line that
continues the description of <br>
the event from the preceding line (note the date may not be
continued in this way). An initial ampersand (&amp;) is
ignored for compatibility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An indented line on which the
first non-whitespace character is # is not displayed with
the calendar entry, but is still scanned for information.
This can be used to hide infor&acirc; <br>
mation useful to the calendar system but not to the user,
such as the unique identifier used by calendar_add.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Emacs extension that a date
with no description may refer to a number of succeeding
events at different times is not supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unless the done-file style has
been altered, any events which have been processed are
appended to the file with the same name as the calendar file
with the suffix .done, hence <br>
~/calendar.done by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An example is shown below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Date Format <br>
The format of the date and time is designed to allow
flexibility without admitting ambiguity. (The words
&lsquo;date&rsquo; and &lsquo;time&rsquo; are both used in
the documentation below; except where <br>
specifically noted this implies a string that may include
both a date and a time specification.) Note that there is no
localization support; month and day names must be in
Eng&acirc; <br>
lish and separator characters are fixed. Matching is case
insensitive, and only the first three letters of the names
are significant, although as a special case a form beginning
<br>
&quot;month&quot; does not match &quot;Monday&quot;.
Furthermore, time zones are not handled; all times are
assumed to be local.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is recommended that, rather
than exploring the intricacies of the system, users find a
date format that is natural to them and stick to it. This
will avoid unexpected <br>
effects. Various key facts should be noted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; In particular,
note the confusion between month/day/year and day/month/year
when the month is numeric; these formats should be avoided
if at all possible. Many alterna&acirc; <br>
tives are available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The year must be
given in full to avoid confusion, and only years from 1900
to 2099 inclusive are matched.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following give some obvious
examples; users finding here a format they like and not
subject to vagaries of style may skip the full description.
As dates and times are <br>
matched separately (even though the time may be embedded in
the date), any date format may be mixed with any format for
the time of day provide the separators are clear
(white&acirc; <br>
space, colons, commas).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2007/04/03 13:13 <br>
2007/04/03:13:13 <br>

Apr 3, 2007 13:13 <br>
Tue Apr 03 13:13:00 2007 <br>
13:13 2007/apr/3</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">More detailed rules follow.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Times are parsed and extracted
before dates. They must use colons to separate hours and
minutes, though a dot is allowed before seconds if they are
present. This limits time <br>
formats to the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
HH:MM[:SS[.FFFFF]] [am|pm|a.m.|p.m.]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; HH:MM.SS[.FFFFF]
[am|pm|a.m.|p.m.]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here, square brackets indicate
optional elements, possibly with alternatives. Fractions of
a second are recognised but ignored. For absolute times (the
normal format require by <br>
the calendar file and the age function) a date is mandatory
but a time of day is not; the time returned is at the start
of the date. One variation is allowed: if a.m. or p.m. or
<br>
one of their variants is present, an hour without a minute
is allowed, e.g. 3 p.m..</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Time zones are not handled,
though if one is matched following a time specification it
will be removed to allow a surrounding date to be parsed.
This only happens if the format <br>
of the timezone is not too unusual. The following are
examples of forms that are understood:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+0100 <br>
GMT <br>
GMT-7 <br>
CET+1CDT</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any part of the timezone that is
not numeric must have exactly three capital letters in the
name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Dates suffer from the ambiguity
between DD/MM/YYYY and MM/DD/YYYY. It is recommended this
form is avoided with purely numeric dates, but use of
ordinals, eg. 3rd/04/2007, will <br>
resolve the ambiguity as the ordinal is always parsed as the
day of the month. Years must be four digits (and the first
two must be 19 or 20); 03/04/08 is not recognised. Other
<br>
numbers may have leading zeroes, but they are not required.
The following are handled:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; YYYY/MM/DD</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; YYYY-MM-DD</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; YYYY/MNM/DD</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; YYYY-MNM-DD</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; DD[th|st|rd]
MNM[,] [ YYYY ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; MNM
DD[th|st|rd][,] [ YYYY ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
DD[th|st|rd]/MM[,] YYYY</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
DD[th|st|rd]/MM/YYYY</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
MM/DD[th|st|rd][,] YYYY</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
MM/DD[th|st|rd]/YYYY</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here, MNM is at least the first
three letters of a month name, matched case-insensitively.
The remainder of the month name may appear but its contents
are irrelevant, so janis&acirc; <br>
sary, febrile, martial, apricot, maybe, junta, etc. are
happily handled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Where the year is shown as
optional, the current year is assumed. There are only two
such cases, the form Jun 20 or 14 September (the only two
commonly occurring forms, apart <br>
from a &quot;the&quot; in some forms of English, which
isn&rsquo;t currently supported). Such dates will of course
become ambiguous in the future, so should ideally be
avoided.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Times may follow dates with a
colon, e.g. 1965/07/12:09:45; this is in order to provide a
format with no whitespace. A comma and whitespace are
allowed, e.g. 1965/07/12, 09:45. <br>
Currently the order of these separators is not checked, so
illogical formats such as 1965/07/12, : ,09:45 will also be
matched. For simplicity such variations are not shown in
<br>
the list above. Otherwise, a time is only recognised as
being associated with a date if there is only whitespace in
between, or if the time was embedded in the date.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Days of the week are not
normally scanned, but will be ignored if they occur at the
start of the date pattern only. However, in contexts where
it is useful to specify dates rel&acirc; <br>
ative to today, days of the week with no other date
specification may be given. The day is assumed to be either
today or within the past week. Likewise, the words
yesterday, <br>
today and tomorrow are handled. All matches are
case-insensitive. Hence if today is Monday, then Sunday is
equivalent to yesterday, Monday is equivalent to today, but
Tuesday <br>
gives a date six days ago. This is not generally useful
within the calendar file. Dates in this format may be
combined with a time specification; for example Tomorrow, 8
p.m..</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, the standard date
format:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fri Aug 18 17:00:48 BST 2006</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">is handled by matching HH:MM:SS
and removing it together with the matched (but unused) time
zone. This leaves the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fri Aug 18 2006</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fri is ignored and the rest is
matched according to the standard rules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Relative Time Format <br>
In certain places relative times are handled. Here, a date
is not allowed; instead a combination of various supported
periods are allowed, together with an optional time. The
<br>
periods must be in order from most to least significant.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In some cases, a more accurate
calculation is possible when there is an anchor date:
offsets of months or years pick the correct day, rather than
being rounded, and it is possi&acirc; <br>
ble to pick a particular day in a month as &lsquo;(1st
Friday)&rsquo;, etc., as described in more detail below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Anchors are available in the
following cases. If one or two times are passed to the
function calendar, the start time acts an anchor for the end
time when the end time is rela&acirc; <br>
tive (even if the start time is implicit). When examining
calendar files, the scheduled event being examined anchors
the warning time when it is given explicitly by means of the
<br>
WARN keyword; likewise, the scheduled event anchors a
repetition period when given by the RPT keyword, so that
specifications such as RPT 2 months, 3rd Thursday are
handled prop&acirc; <br>
erly. Finally, the -R argument to calendar_scandate directly
provides an anchor for relative calculations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The periods handled, with
possible abbreviations are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Years years, yrs, ys, year, yr,
y, yearly. A year is 365.25 days unless there is an
anchor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Months months, mons, mnths,
mths, month, mon, mnth, mth, monthly. Note that m, ms, mn,
mns are ambiguous and are not handled. A month is a period
of 30 days rather than a cal&acirc; <br>
endar month unless there is an anchor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Weeks weeks, wks, ws, week, wk,
w, weekly</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Days days, dys, ds, day, dy, d,
daily</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hours hours, hrs, hs, hour, hr,
h, hourly</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Minutes <br>
minutes, mins, minute, min, but not m, ms, mn or mns</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Seconds <br>
seconds, secs, ss, second, sec, s</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Spaces between the numbers are
optional, but are required between items, although a comma
may be used (with or without spaces).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The forms yearly to hourly allow
the number to be omitted; it is assumed to be 1. For
example, 1 d and daily are equivalent. Note that using those
forms with plurals is confus&acirc; <br>
ing; 2 yearly is the same as 2 years, not twice yearly, so
it is recommended they only be used without numbers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When an anchor time is present,
there is an extension to handle regular events in the form
of the nth someday of the month. Such a specification must
occur immediately after any <br>
year and month specification, but before any time of day,
and must be in the form n(th|st|rd) day, for example 1st
Tuesday or 3rd Monday. As in other places, days are matched
<br>
case insensitively, must be in English, and only the first
three letters are significant except that a form beginning
&lsquo;month&rsquo; does not match &lsquo;Monday&rsquo;. No
attempt is made to san&acirc; <br>
itize the resulting date; attempts to squeeze too many
occurrences into a month will push the day into the next
month (but in the obvious fashion, retaining the correct day
of <br>
the week).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here are some examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">30 years 3 months 4 days 3:42:41
<br>
14 days 5 hours <br>
Monthly, 3rd Thursday <br>
4d,10hr</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example <br>
Here is an example calendar file. It uses a consistent date
format, as recommended above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Feb 1, 2006 14:30 Pointless

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The second entry has a
continuation line. The third entry has a continuation line
that will not be shown when the entry is displayed, but the
unique identifier will be used by <br>
the calendar_add function when updating the event. The
fourth entry will produce a warning 30 minutes before the
event (to allow you to equip yourself appropriately). The
fifth <br>
entry repeats after a month on the 3rd Thursday, i.e. June
15, 2006, at the same time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USER FUNCTIONS <br>
This section describes functions that are designed to be
called directly by the user. The first part describes those
functions associated with the user&rsquo;s calendar; the
second <br>
part describes the use in glob qualifiers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Calendar system functions <br>
calendar [ -abdDsv ] [ -C calfile ] [ -n num ] [ -S showprog
] [ [ start ] end ]( <br>
calendar -r [ -abdDrsv ] [ -C calfile ] [ -n num ] [ -S
showprog ] [ start ] <br>
Show events in the calendar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With no arguments, show events
from the start of today until the end of the next working
day after today. In other words, if today is Friday,
Saturday, or Sunday, show up <br>
to the end of the following Monday, otherwise show today and
tomorrow.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If end is given, show events
from the start of today up to the time and date given, which
is in the format described in the previous section. Note
that if this is a date <br>
the time is assumed to be midnight at the start of the date,
so that effectively this shows all events before the given
date.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">end may start with a +, in which
case the remainder of the specification is a relative time
format as described in the previous section indicating the
range of time from <br>
the start time that is to be included.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If start is also given, show
events starting from that time and date. The word now can be
used to indicate the current time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To implement an alert when
events are due, include calendar -s in your ~/.zshrc
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a Show all items in the
calendar, regardless of the start and end.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b Brief: don&rsquo;t display
continuation lines (i.e. indented lines following the line
with the date/time), just the first line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B lines <br>
Brief: display at most the first lines lines of the calendar
entry. &lsquo;-B 1&rsquo; is equivalent to
&lsquo;-b&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C calfile <br>
Explicitly specify a calendar file instead of the value of
the calendar-file style or the default ~/calendar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Move any events that have
passed from the calendar file to the &quot;done&quot; file,
as given by the done-file style or the default which is the
calendar file with .done <br>
appended. This option is implied by the -s option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D Turns off the option -d, even
if the -s option is also present.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n num, -num <br>
Show at least num events, if present in the calendar file,
regardless of the start and end.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Show all the remaining
options in the calendar, ignoring the given end time. The
start time is respected; any argument given is treated as a
start time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Use the shell&rsquo;s sched
command to schedule a timed event that will warn the user
when an event is due. Note that the sched command only runs
if the shell is at an <br>
interactive prompt; a foreground task blocks the scheduled
task from running until it is finished.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The timed event usually runs the
programme calendar_show to show the event, as described in
the section UTILITY FUNCTIONS below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, a warning of the
event is shown five minutes before it is due. The warning
period can be configured by the style warn-time or for a
single calendar <br>
entry by including WARN reltime in the first line of the
entry, where reltime is one of the usual relative time
formats.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A repeated event may be
indicated by including RPT reldate in the first line of the
entry. After the scheduled event has been displayed it will
be re-entered into <br>
the calendar file at a time reldate after the existing
event. Note that this is currently the only use made of the
repeat count, so that it is not possible to <br>
query the schedule for a recurrence of an event in the
calendar until the previous event has passed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If RPT is used, it is also
possible to specify that certain recurrences of an event are
rescheduled or cancelled. This is done with the OCCURRENCE
keyword, fol&acirc; <br>
lowed by whitespace and the date and time of the occurrence
in the regular sequence, followed by whitespace and either
the date and time of the rescheduled event or <br>
the exact string CANCELLED. In this case the date and time
must be in exactly the &quot;date with local time&quot;
format used by the text/calendar MIME type (RFC 2445), <br>

&lt;YYYY&gt;&lt;MM&gt;&lt;DD&gt;T&lt;hh&gt;&lt;mm&gt;&lt;ss&gt;
(note the presence of the literal character T). The first
word (the regular recurrence) may be something other than a
proper date/time <br>
to indicate that the event is additional to the normal
sequence; a convention that retains the formatting
appearance is XXXXXXXXTXXXXXX.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Furthermore, it is useful to
record the next regular recurrence (as then the displayed
date may be for a rescheduled event so cannot be used for
calculating the <br>
regular sequence). This is specified by RECURRENCE and a
time or date in the same format. calendar_add adds such an
indication when it encounters a recurring <br>
event that does not include one, based on the headline
date/time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If calendar_add is used to
update occurrences the UID keyword described there should be
present in both the existing entry and the added occurrence
in order to <br>
identify recurring event sequences.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Thu May 6, 2010 11:00 Informal
chat RPT 1 week <br>
# RECURRENCE 20100506T110000 <br>
# OCCURRENCE 20100513T110000 20100513T120000 <br>
# OCCURRENCE 20100520T110000 CANCELLED</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The event that occurs at 11:00
on 13th May 2010 is rescheduled an hour later. The event
that occurs a week later is cancelled. The occurrences are
given on a con&acirc; <br>
tinuation line starting with a # character so will not
usually be displayed as part of the event. As elsewhere, no
account of time zones is taken with the times. <br>
After the next event occurs the headline date/time will be
&lsquo;Thu May 13, 2010 12:00&rsquo; while the RECURRENCE
date/time will be &lsquo;20100513T110000&rsquo; (note that
cancelled <br>
and moved events are not taken account of in the RECURRENCE,
which records what the next regular recurrence is, but they
are accounted for in the headline <br>
date/time).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is safe to run calendar -s to
reschedule an existing event (if the calendar file has
changed, for example), and also to have it running in
multiples instances of <br>
the shell since the calendar file is locked when in use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, expired events are
moved to the &quot;done&quot; file; see the -d option. Use
-D to prevent this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S showprog <br>
Explicitly specify a programme to be used for showing events
instead of the value of the show-prog style or the default
calendar_show.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Verbose: show more
information about stages of processing. This is useful for
confirming that the function has successfully parsed the
dates in the calendar file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">calendar_add [ -BL ] event ...
<br>
Adds a single event to the calendar in the appropriate
location. The event can contain multiple lines, as described
in the section Calendar File Format above. Using this <br>
function ensures that the calendar file is sorted in date
and time order. It also makes special arrangements for
locking the file while it is altered. The old calendar <br>
is left in a file with the suffix .old.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The option -B indicates that
backing up the calendar file will be handled by the caller
and should not be performed by calendar_add. The option -L
indicates that calen&acirc; <br>
dar_add does not need to lock the calendar file as it is
already locked. These options will not usually be needed by
users.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the style reformat-date is
true, the date and time of the new entry will be rewritten
into the standard date format: see the descriptions of this
style and the style <br>
date-format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The function can use a unique
identifier stored with each event to ensure that updates to
existing events are treated correctly. The entry should
contain the word UID, <br>
followed by whitespace, followed by a word consisting
entirely of hexadecimal digits of arbitrary length (all
digits are significant, including leading zeroes). As the
<br>
UID is not directly useful to the user, it is convenient to
hide it on an indented continuation line starting with a #,
for example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Aug 31, 2007 09:30 Celebrate the
end of the holidays <br>
# UID 045B78A0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The second line will not be
shown by the calendar function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is possible to specify the
RPT keyword followed by CANCELLED instead of a relative
time. This causes any matched event or series of events to
be cancelled (the origi&acirc; <br>
nal event does not have to be marked as recurring in order
to be cancelled by this method). A UID is required in order
to match an existing event in the calendar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">calendar_add will attempt to
manage recurrences and occurrences of repeating events as
described for event scheduling by calendar -s above. To
reschedule or cancel a sin&acirc; <br>
gle event calendar_add should be called with an entry that
includes the correct UID but does not include the RPT
keyword as this is taken to mean the entry applies to a <br>
series of repeating events and hence replaces all existing
information. Each rescheduled or cancelled occurrence must
have an OCCURRENCE keyword in the entry passed to <br>
calendar_add which will be merged into the calendar file.
Any existing reference to the occurrence is replaced. An
occurrence that does not refer to a valid existing <br>
event is added as a one-off occurrence to the same calendar
entry.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">calendar_edit <br>
This calls the user&rsquo;s editor to edit the calendar
file. If there are arguments, they are taken as the editor
to use (the file name is appended to the commands);
other&acirc; <br>
wise, the editor is given by the variable VISUAL, if set,
else the variable EDITOR.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the calendar scheduler was
running, then after editing the file calendar -s is called
to update it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This function locks out the
calendar system during the edit. Hence it should be used to
edit the calendar file if there is any possibility of a
calendar event occurring <br>
meanwhile. Note this can lead to another shell with calendar
functions enabled hanging waiting for a lock, so it is
necessary to quit the editor as soon as possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">calendar_parse calendar-entry
<br>
This is the internal function that analyses the parts of a
calendar entry, which is passed as the only argument. The
function returns status 1 if the argument could not <br>
be parsed as a calendar entry and status 2 if the wrong
number of arguments were passed; it also sets the parameter
reply to an empty associative array. Otherwise, it <br>
returns status 0 and sets elements of the associative array
reply as follows: <br>
time The time as a string of digits in the same units as
$EPOCHSECONDS <br>
schedtime <br>
The regularly scheduled time. This may differ from the
actual event time time if this is a recurring event and the
next occurrence has been rescheduled. Then time gives <br>
the actual time and schedtime the time of the regular
recurrence before modification. <br>
text1 The text from the line not including the date and time
of the event, but including any WARN or RPT keywords and
values. <br>
warntime <br>
Any warning time given by the WARN keyword as a string of
digits containing the time at which to warn in the same
units as $EPOCHSECONDS. (Note this is an absolute time, <br>
not the relative time passed down.) Not set no WARN keyword
and value were matched. <br>
warnstr <br>
The raw string matched after the WARN keyword, else unset.
<br>
rpttime <br>
Any recurrence time given by the RPT keyword as a string of
digits containing the time of the recurrence in the same
units as $EPOCHSECONDS. (Note this is an absolute <br>
time.) Not set if no RPT keyword and value were matched.
<br>
schedrpttime <br>
The next regularly scheduled occurrence of a recurring event
before modification. This may differ from rpttime, which is
the actual time of the event that may have been <br>
rescheduled from the regular time. <br>
rptstr The raw string matched after the RPT keyword, else
unset. <br>
text2 The text from the line after removal of the date and
any keywords and values. )</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">calendar_showdate [ -r ] [ -f
fmt ] date-spec ... <br>
The given date-spec is interpreted and the corresponding
date and time printed. If the initial date-spec begins with
a + or - it is treated as relative to the current <br>
time; date-specs after the first are treated as relative to
the date calculated so far and a leading + is optional in
that case. This allows one to use the system as a <br>
date calculator. For example, calendar_showdate &rsquo;+1
month, 1st Friday&rsquo; shows the date of the first Friday
of next month.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With the option -r nothing is
printed but the value of the date and time in seconds since
the epoch is stored in the parameter REPLY.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With the option -f fmt the given
date/time conversion format is passed to strftime; see notes
on the date-format style below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to avoid ambiguity with
negative relative date specifications, options must occur in
separate words; in other words, -r and -f should not be
combined in the same <br>
word.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">calendar_sort <br>
Sorts the calendar file into date and time order. The old
calendar is left in a file with the suffix .old.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Glob qualifiers <br>
The function age can be autoloaded and use separately from
the calendar system, although it uses the function
calendar_scandate for date formatting. It requires the
zsh/stat <br>
builtin, but uses only the builtin zstat.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">age selects files having a given
modification time for use as a glob qualifier. The format of
the date is the same as that understood by the calendar
system, described in the <br>
section FILE AND DATE FORMATS above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The function can take one or two
arguments, which can be supplied either directly as command
or arguments, or separately as shell parameters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print *(e:age 2006/10/04
2006/10/09:)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The example above matches all
files modified between the start of those dates. The second
argument may alternatively be a relative time introduced by
a +:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print *(e:age 2006/10/04
+5d:)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The example above is equivalent
to the previous example.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition to the special use
of days of the week, today and yesterday, times with no date
may be specified; these apply to today. Obviously such uses
become problematic around <br>
midnight.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print *(e-age 12:00 13:30-)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The example above shows files
modified between 12:00 and 13:00 today.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print *(e:age 2006/10/04:)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The example above matches all
files modified on that date. If the second argument is
omitted it is taken to be exactly 24 hours after the first
argument (even if the first argu&acirc; <br>
ment contains a time).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print *(e-age 2006/10/04:10:15
2006/10/04:10:45-)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The example above supplies
times. Note that whitespace within the time and date
specification must be quoted to ensure age receives the
correct arguments, hence the use of the <br>
additional colon to separate the date and time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AGEREF1=2006/10/04:10:15 <br>
AGEREF2=2006/10/04:10:45 <br>
print *(+age)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This shows the same example
before using another form of argument passing. The dates and
times in the parameters AGEREF1 and AGEREF2 stay in effect
until unset, but will be <br>
overridden if any argument is passed as an explicit argument
to age. Any explicit argument causes both parameters to be
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STYLES <br>
The zsh style mechanism using the zstyle command is describe
in zshmodules(1). This is the same mechanism used in the
completion system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The styles below are all
examined in the context :datetime:function:, for example
:datetime:calendar:.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">calendar-file <br>
The location of the main calendar. The default is
~/calendar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">date-format <br>
A strftime format string (see strftime(3)) with the zsh
extensions providing various numbers with no leading zero or
space if the number is a single digit as described for <br>
the %D{string} prompt format in the section EXPANSION OF
PROMPT SEQUENCES in zshmisc(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is used for outputting
dates in calendar, both to support the -v option and when
adding recurring events back to the calendar file, and in
calendar_showdate as the <br>
final output format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the style is not set, the
default used is similar the standard system format as output
by the date command (also known as &lsquo;ctime
format&rsquo;): &lsquo;%a %b %d %H:%M:%S %Z %Y&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">done-file <br>
The location of the file to which events which have passed
are appended. The default is the calendar file location with
the suffix .done. The style may be set to an <br>
empty string in which case a &quot;done&quot; file will not
be maintained.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reformat-date <br>
Boolean, used by calendar_add. If it is true, the date and
time of new entries added to the calendar will be
reformatted to the format given by the style date-format or
<br>
its default. Only the date and time of the event itself is
reformatted; any subsidiary dates and times such as those
associated with repeat and warning times are left <br>
alone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">show-prog <br>
The programme run by calendar for showing events. It will be
passed the start time and stop time of the events requested
in seconds since the epoch followed by the event <br>
text. Note that calendar -s uses a start time and stop time
equal to one another to indicate alerts for specific
events.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is the function
calendar_show.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">warn-time <br>
The time before an event at which a warning will be
displayed, if the first line of the event does not include
the text EVENT reltime. The default is 5 minutes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UTILITY FUNCTIONS <br>
calendar_lockfiles <br>
Attempt to lock the files given in the argument. To prevent
problems with network file locking this is done in an ad hoc
fashion by attempting to create a symbolic link <br>
to the file with the name file.lockfile. No other system
level functions are used for locking, i.e. the file can be
accessed and modified by any utility that does not use <br>
this mechanism. In particular, the user is not prevented
from editing the calendar file at the same time unless
calendar_edit is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Three attempts are made to lock
the file before giving up. If the module zsh/zselect is
available, the times of the attempts are jittered so that
multiple instances of <br>
the calling function are unlikely to retry at the same
time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The files locked are appended to
the array lockfiles, which should be local to the
caller.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If all files were successfully
locked, status zero is returned, else status one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This function may be used as a
general file locking function, although this will only work
if only this mechanism is used to lock files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">calendar_read <br>
This is a backend used by various other functions to parse
the calendar file, which is passed as the only argument. The
array calendar_entries is set to the list of <br>
events in the file; no pruning is done except that
ampersands are removed from the start of the line. Each
entry may contain multiple lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">calendar_scandate <br>
This is a generic function to parse dates and times that may
be used separately from the calendar system. The argument is
a date or time specification as described in the <br>
section FILE AND DATE FORMATS above. The parameter REPLY is
set to the number of seconds since the epoch corresponding
to that date or time. By default, the date and <br>
time may occur anywhere within the given argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Returns status zero if the date
and time were successfully parsed, else one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options: <br>
-a The date and time are anchored to the start of the
argument; they will not be matched if there is preceding
text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A The date and time are
anchored to both the start and end of the argument; they
will not be matched if the is any other text in the
argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Enable additional debugging
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m Minus. When -R anchor_time is
also given the relative time is calculated backwards from
anchor_time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r The argument passed is to be
parsed as a relative time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R anchor_time <br>
The argument passed is to be parsed as a relative time. The
time is relative to anchor_time, a time in seconds since the
epoch, and the returned value is the abso&acirc; <br>
lute time corresponding to advancing anchor_time by the
relative time given. This allows lengths of months to be
correctly taken into account. If the final day <br>
does not exist in the given month, the last day of the final
month is given. For example, if the anchor time is during
31st January 2007 and the relative time is 1 <br>
month, the final time is the same time of day during 28th
February 2007.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s In addition to setting REPLY,
set REPLY2 to the remainder of the argument after the date
and time have been stripped. This is empty if the option -A
was given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Allow a time with no date
specification. The date is assumed to be today. The
behaviour is unspecified if the iron tongue of midnight is
tolling twelve.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">calendar_show <br>
The function used by default to display events. It accepts a
start time and end time for events, both in epoch seconds,
and an event description.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The event is always printed to
standard output. If the command line editor is active (which
will usually be the case) the command line will be
redisplayed after the out&acirc; <br>
put.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the parameter DISPLAY is set
and the start and end times are the same (indicating a
scheduled event), the function uses the command xmessage to
display a window with <br>
the event details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
As the system is based entirely on shell functions (with a
little support from the zsh/datetime module) the mechanisms
used are not as robust as those provided by a dedicated <br>
calendar utility. Consequently the user should not rely on
the shell for vital alerts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is no calendar_delete
function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is no localization support
for dates and times, nor any support for the use of time
zones.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Relative periods of months and
years do not take into account the variable number of
days.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The calendar_show function is
currently hardwired to use xmessage for displaying alerts on
X Window System displays. This should be configurable and
ideally integrate better <br>
with the desktop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">calendar_lockfiles hangs the
shell while waiting for a lock on a file. If called from a
scheduled task, it should instead reschedule the event that
caused it.</p>
