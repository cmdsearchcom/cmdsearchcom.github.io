zshcalsys - zsh calendar system
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
The shell is supplied with a series of functions to replace and enhance the
  traditional Unix <b>calendar</b> programme, which warns the user of imminent
  or future events, details of which are stored in a text file (typically
  <b>calendar</b> in the user's home directory). The version provided here
  includes a mechanism for alerting the user when an event is due.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In addition a function <b>age</b> is provided that can be used in a glob
  qualifier; it allows files to be selected based on their modification times.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The format of the <b>calendar</b> file and the dates used there in and in the
  <b>age</b> function are described first, then the functions that can be called
  to examine and modify the <b>calendar</b> file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The functions here depend on the availability of the <b>zsh/datetime</b> module
  which is usually installed with the shell. The library function
  <b>strptime()</b> must be available; it is present on most recent operating
  systems.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="FILE_AND_DATE_FORMATS"><a class="selflink" href="#FILE_AND_DATE_FORMATS">FILE
  AND DATE FORMATS</a></h1>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Calendar_File_Format"><a class="selflink" href="#Calendar_File_Format">Calendar
  File Format</a></h2>
The calendar file is by default <b>~/calendar</b>. This can be configured by the
  <b>calendar-file</b> style, see the section STYLES below. The basic format
  consists of a series of separate lines, with no indentation, each including a
  date and time specification followed by a description of the event.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Various enhancements to this format are supported, based on the syntax of Emacs
  calendar mode. An indented line indicates a continuation line that continues
  the description of the event from the preceding line (note the date may not be
  continued in this way). An initial ampersand ( <b>&amp;</b>) is ignored for
  compatibility.
<div class="Pp"></div>
An indented line on which the first non-whitespace character is <b>#</b> is not
  displayed with the calendar entry, but is still scanned for information. This
  can be used to hide information useful to the calendar system but not to the
  user, such as the unique identifier used by <b>calendar_add</b>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The Emacs extension that a date with no description may refer to a number of
  succeeding events at different times is not supported.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Unless the <b>done-file</b> style has been altered, any events which have been
  processed are appended to the file with the same name as the calendar file
  with the suffix <b>.done</b>, hence <b>~/calendar.done</b> by default.
<div class="Pp"></div>
An example is shown below.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Date_Format"><a class="selflink" href="#Date_Format">Date
  Format</a></h2>
The format of the date and time is designed to allow flexibility without
  admitting ambiguity. (The words `date' and `time' are both used in the
  documentation below; except where specifically noted this implies a string
  that may include both a date and a time specification.) Note that there is no
  localization support; month and day names must be in English and separator
  characters are fixed. Matching is case insensitive, and only the first three
  letters of the names are significant, although as a special case a form
  beginning &quot;month&quot; does not match &quot;Monday&quot;. Furthermore,
  time zones are not handled; all times are assumed to be local.
<div class="Pp"></div>
It is recommended that, rather than exploring the intricacies of the system,
  users find a date format that is natural to them and stick to it. This will
  avoid unexpected effects. Various key facts should be noted.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">In particular, note the confusion between
      <i>month</i><b>/</b> <i>day</i><b>/</b><i>year</i> and
      <i>day</i><b>/</b><i>month</i><b>/</b><i>year</i> when the month is
      numeric; these formats should be avoided if at all possible. Many
      alternatives are available.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The year must be given in full to avoid confusion, and only
      years from 1900 to 2099 inclusive are matched.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The following give some obvious examples; users finding here a format they like
  and not subject to vagaries of style may skip the full description. As dates
  and times are matched separately (even though the time may be embedded in the
  date), any date format may be mixed with any format for the time of day
  provide the separators are clear (whitespace, colons, commas).
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<pre>
<b>2007/04/03 13:13</b>
<b>2007/04/03:13:13</b>
<b>2007/04/03 1:13 pm</b>
<b>3rd April 2007, 13:13</b>
<b>April 3rd 2007 1:13 p.m.</b>
<b>Apr 3, 2007 13:13</b>
<b>Tue Apr 03 13:13:00 2007</b>
<b>13:13 2007/apr/3</b>
</pre>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
More detailed rules follow.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Times are parsed and extracted before dates. They must use colons to separate
  hours and minutes, though a dot is allowed before seconds if they are present.
  This limits time formats to the following:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><i>HH</i><b>:</b><i>MM</i>[<b>:</b><i>SS</i>[<b>.</b><i>FFFFF</i>]]
      [ <b>am</b>|<b>pm</b>|<b>a.m.</b>|<b>p.m.</b>]</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><i>HH</i><b>:</b><i>MM</i><b>.</b><i>SS</i>[<b>.</b><i>FFFFF</i>]
      [ <b>am</b>|<b>pm</b>|<b>a.m.</b>|<b>p.m.</b>]</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Here, square brackets indicate optional elements, possibly with alternatives.
  Fractions of a second are recognised but ignored. For absolute times (the
  normal format require by the <b>calendar</b> file and the <b>age</b> function)
  a date is mandatory but a time of day is not; the time returned is at the
  start of the date. One variation is allowed: if <b>a.m.</b> or <b>p.m.</b> or
  one of their variants is present, an hour without a minute is allowed, e.g.
  <b>3 p.m.</b>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Time zones are not handled, though if one is matched following a time
  specification it will be removed to allow a surrounding date to be parsed.
  This only happens if the format of the timezone is not too unusual. The
  following are examples of forms that are understood:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<pre>
<b>+0100</b>
<b>GMT</b>
<b>GMT-7</b>
<b>CET+1CDT</b>
</pre>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Any part of the timezone that is not numeric must have exactly three capital
  letters in the name.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Dates suffer from the ambiguity between
  <i>DD</i><b>/</b><i>MM</i><b>/</b><i>YYYY</i> and
  <i>MM</i><b>/</b><i>DD</i><b>/</b><i>YYYY</i>. It is recommended this form is
  avoided with purely numeric dates, but use of ordinals, eg.
  <b>3rd/04/2007</b>, will resolve the ambiguity as the ordinal is always parsed
  as the day of the month. Years must be four digits (and the first two must be
  <b>19</b> or <b>20</b>); <b>03/04/08</b> is not recognised. Other numbers may
  have leading zeroes, but they are not required. The following are handled:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><i>YYYY</i><b>/</b><i>MM</i><b>/</b><i>DD</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>

  <dd class="It-tag"><i>DD</i>[<b>th</b>|<b>st</b>|<b>rd</b>]<b>/</b><i>MM</i>[<b>,</b>]
      <i>YYYY</i></dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><i>MM</i><b>/</b><i>DD</i>[<b>th</b>|<b>st</b>|<b>rd</b>][<b>,</b>]
      <i>YYYY</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><i>MM</i><b>/</b><i>DD</i>[<b>th</b>|<b>st</b>|<b>rd</b>]<b>/</b><i>YYYY</i></dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Here, <i>MNM</i> is at least the first three letters of a month name, matched
  case-insensitively. The remainder of the month name may appear but its
  contents are irrelevant, so janissary, febrile, martial, apricot, maybe,
  junta, etc. are happily handled.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Where the year is shown as optional, the current year is assumed. There are only
  two such cases, the form <b>Jun 20</b> or <b>14 September</b> (the only two
  commonly occurring forms, apart from a &quot;the&quot; in some forms of
  English, which isn't currently supported). Such dates will of course become
  ambiguous in the future, so should ideally be avoided.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Times may follow dates with a colon, e.g. <b>1965/07/12:09:45</b>; this is in
  order to provide a format with no whitespace. A comma and whitespace are
  allowed, e.g. <b>1965/07/12, 09:45</b>. Currently the order of these
  separators is not checked, so illogical formats such as <b>1965/07/12, :</b>
  <b>,09:45</b> will also be matched. For simplicity such variations are not
  shown in the list above. Otherwise, a time is only recognised as being
  associated with a date if there is only whitespace in between, or if the time
  was embedded in the date.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Days of the week are not normally scanned, but will be ignored if they occur at
  the start of the date pattern only. However, in contexts where it is useful to
  specify dates relative to today, days of the week with no other date
  specification may be given. The day is assumed to be either today or within
  the past week. Likewise, the words <b>yesterday</b>, <b>today</b> and
  <b>tomorrow</b> are handled. All matches are case-insensitive. Hence if today
  is Monday, then <b>Sunday</b> is equivalent to <b>yesterday</b>, <b>Monday</b>
  is equivalent to <b>today</b>, but <b>Tuesday</b> gives a date six days ago.
  This is not generally useful within the calendar file. Dates in this format
  may be combined with a time specification; for example <b>Tomorrow, 8
  p.m.</b>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For example, the standard date format:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<pre>
<b>Fri Aug 18 17:00:48 BST 2006</b>
</pre>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
is handled by matching <i>HH</i><b>:</b><i>MM</i><b>:</b><i>SS</i> and removing
  it together with the matched (but unused) time zone. This leaves the
  following:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<pre>
<b>Fri Aug 18 2006</b>
</pre>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Fri</b> is ignored and the rest is matched according to the standard rules.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Relative_Time_Format"><a class="selflink" href="#Relative_Time_Format">Relative
  Time Format</a></h2>
In certain places relative times are handled. Here, a date is not allowed;
  instead a combination of various supported periods are allowed, together with
  an optional time. The periods must be in order from most to least significant.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In some cases, a more accurate calculation is possible when there is an anchor
  date: offsets of months or years pick the correct day, rather than being
  rounded, and it is possible to pick a particular day in a month as `(1st
  Friday)', etc., as described in more detail below.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Anchors are available in the following cases. If one or two times are passed to
  the function <b>calendar</b>, the start time acts an anchor for the end time
  when the end time is relative (even if the start time is implicit). When
  examining calendar files, the scheduled event being examined anchors the
  warning time when it is given explicitly by means of the <b>WARN</b> keyword;
  likewise, the scheduled event anchors a repetition period when given by the
  <b>RPT</b> keyword, so that specifications such as <b>RPT 2 months, 3rd
  Thursday</b> are handled properly. Finally, the <b>-R</b> argument to
  <b>calendar_scandate</b> directly provides an anchor for relative
  calculations.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The periods handled, with possible abbreviations are:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">Years</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>years</b>, <b>yrs</b>, <b>ys</b>, <b>year</b>,
      <b>yr</b>, <b>y</b>, <b>yearly</b>. A year is 365.25 days unless there is
      an anchor.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">Months</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>months</b>, <b>mons</b>, <b>mnths</b>, <b>mths</b>,
      <b>month</b>, <b>mon</b>, <b>mnth</b>, <b>mth</b>, <b>monthly</b>. Note
      that <b>m</b>, <b>ms</b>, <b>mn</b>, <b>mns</b> are ambiguous and are
      <i>not</i> handled. A month is a period of 30 days rather than a calendar
      month unless there is an anchor.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">Weeks</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>weeks</b>, <b>wks</b>, <b>ws</b>, <b>week</b>,

  <dd class="It-tag"><b>seconds</b>, <b>secs</b>, <b>ss</b>, <b>second</b>,
      <b>sec</b>, <b>s</b></dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Spaces between the numbers are optional, but are required between items,
  although a comma may be used (with or without spaces).
<div class="Pp"></div>
The forms <b>yearly</b> to <b>hourly</b> allow the number to be omitted; it is
  assumed to be 1. For example, <b>1 d</b> and <b>daily</b> are equivalent. Note
  that using those forms with plurals is confusing; <b>2 yearly</b> is the same
  as <b>2 years</b>, <i>not</i> twice yearly, so it is recommended they only be
  used without numbers.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When an anchor time is present, there is an extension to handle regular events
  in the form of the <i>n</i>th <i>some</i>day of the month. Such a
  specification must occur immediately after any year and month specification,
  but before any time of day, and must be in the form <i>n</i><b>(th|st|rd)</b>
  <i>day</i>, for example <b>1st Tuesday</b> or <b>3rd Monday</b>. As in other
  places, days are matched case insensitively, must be in English, and only the
  first three letters are significant except that a form beginning `month' does
  not match `Monday'. No attempt is made to sanitize the resulting date;
  attempts to squeeze too many occurrences into a month will push the day into
  the next month (but in the obvious fashion, retaining the correct day of the
  week).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Here are some examples:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<pre>
<b>30 years 3 months 4 days 3:42:41</b>
<b>14 days 5 hours</b>

The second entry has a continuation line. The third entry has a continuation
  line that will not be shown when the entry is displayed, but the unique
  identifier will be used by the <b>calendar_add</b> function when updating the
  event. The fourth entry will produce a warning 30 minutes before the event (to
  allow you to equip yourself appropriately). The fifth entry repeats after a
  month on the 3rd Thursday, i.e. June 15, 2006, at the same time.

<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="Pp"></div>
The timed event usually runs the programme <b>calendar_show</b> to show the
  event, as described in the section UTILITY FUNCTIONS below.
<div class="Pp"></div>
By default, a warning of the event is shown five minutes before it is due. The
  warning period can be configured by the style <b>warn-time</b> or for a single
  calendar entry by including <b>WARN</b> <i>reltime</i> in the first line of
  the entry, where <i>reltime</i> is one of the usual relative time formats.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A repeated event may be indicated by including <b>RPT</b> <i>reldate</i> in the
  first line of the entry. After the scheduled event has been displayed it will
  be re-entered into the calendar file at a time <i>reldate</i> after the
  existing event. Note that this is currently the only use made of the repeat
  count, so that it is not possible to query the schedule for a recurrence of an
  event in the calendar until the previous event has passed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If <b>RPT</b> is used, it is also possible to specify that certain recurrences
  of an event are rescheduled or cancelled. This is done with the
  <b>OCCURRENCE</b> keyword, followed by whitespace and the date and time of the
  occurrence in the regular sequence, followed by whitespace and either the date
  and time of the rescheduled event or the exact string <b>CANCELLED</b>. In
  this case the date and time must be in exactly the &quot;date with local
  time&quot; format used by the <b>text/calendar</b> MIME type (RFC 2445),
  <i>&lt;YYYY&gt;&lt;MM&gt;&lt;DD&gt;</i>
  <b>T</b><i>&lt;hh&gt;&lt;mm&gt;&lt;ss&gt;</i> (note the presence of the
  literal character <b>T</b>). The first word (the regular recurrence) may be
  something other than a proper date/time to indicate that the event is
  additional to the normal sequence; a convention that retains the formatting
  appearance is <b>XXXXXXXXTXXXXXX</b>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Furthermore, it is useful to record the next regular recurrence (as then the
  displayed date may be for a rescheduled event so cannot be used for
  calculating the regular sequence). This is specified by <b>RECURRENCE</b> and
  a time or date in the same format. <b>calendar_add</b> adds such an indication
  when it encounters a recurring event that does not include one, based on the
  headline date/time.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If <b>calendar_add</b> is used to update occurrences the <b>UID</b> keyword
  described there should be present in both the existing entry and the added
  occurrence in order to identify recurring event sequences.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For example,
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<pre>
<b>Thu May 6, 2010 11:00 Informal chat RPT 1 week</b>
<b>  # RECURRENCE 20100506T110000</b>
<b>  # OCCURRENCE 20100513T110000 20100513T120000</b>
<b>  # OCCURRENCE 20100520T110000 CANCELLED</b>
</pre>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The event that occurs at 11:00 on 13th May 2010 is rescheduled an hour later.
  The event that occurs a week later is cancelled. The occurrences are given on
  a continuation line starting with a <b>#</b> character so will not usually be
  displayed as part of the event. As elsewhere, no account of time zones is
  taken with the times. After the next event occurs the headline date/time will
  be ` <b>Thu May 13, 2010 12:00</b>' while the <b>RECURRENCE</b> date/time will
  be ` <b>20100513T110000</b>' (note that cancelled and moved events are not
  taken account of in the <b>RECURRENCE</b>, which records what the next regular
  recurrence is, but they are accounted for in the headline date/time).
<div class="Pp"></div>
It is safe to run <b>calendar -s</b> to reschedule an existing event (if the
  calendar file has changed, for example), and also to have it running in
  multiples instances of the shell since the calendar file is locked when in
  use.
<div class="Pp"></div>
By default, expired events are moved to the &quot;done&quot; file; see the
  <b>-d</b> option. Use <b>-D</b> to prevent this.</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">

</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>calendar_add</b> [ <b>-BL</b> ] <i>event ...</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Adds a single event to the calendar in the appropriate
      location. The event can contain multiple lines, as described in the
      section Calendar File Format above. Using this function ensures that the
      calendar file is sorted in date and time order. It also makes special
      arrangements for locking the file while it is altered. The old calendar is
      left in a file with the suffix <b>.old</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="Pp"></div>
The option <b>-B</b> indicates that backing up the calendar file will be handled
  by the caller and should not be performed by <b>calendar_add</b>. The option
  <b>-L</b> indicates that <b>calendar_add</b> does not need to lock the
  calendar file as it is already locked. These options will not usually be
  needed by users.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the style <b>reformat-date</b> is true, the date and time of the new entry
  will be rewritten into the standard date format: see the descriptions of this
  style and the style <b>date-format</b>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The function can use a unique identifier stored with each event to ensure that
  updates to existing events are treated correctly. The entry should contain the
  word <b>UID</b>, followed by whitespace, followed by a word consisting
  entirely of hexadecimal digits of arbitrary length (all digits are
  significant, including leading zeroes). As the UID is not directly useful to
  the user, it is convenient to hide it on an indented continuation line
  starting with a <b>#</b>, for example:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<pre>
<b>Aug 31, 2007 09:30  Celebrate the end of the holidays</b>
<b>  # UID 045B78A0</b>
</pre>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The second line will not be shown by the <b>calendar</b> function.
<div class="Pp"></div>
It is possible to specify the <b>RPT</b> keyword followed by <b>CANCELLED</b>
  instead of a relative time. This causes any matched event or series of events
  to be cancelled (the original event does not have to be marked as recurring in
  order to be cancelled by this method). A <b>UID</b> is required in order to
  match an existing event in the calendar.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>calendar_add</b> will attempt to manage recurrences and occurrences of
  repeating events as described for event scheduling by <b>calendar -s</b>
  above. To reschedule or cancel a single event <b>calendar_add</b> should be
  called with an entry that includes the correct <b>UID</b> but does <i>not</i>
  include the <b>RPT</b> keyword as this is taken to mean the entry applies to a
  series of repeating events and hence replaces all existing information. Each
  rescheduled or cancelled occurrence must have an <b>OCCURRENCE</b> keyword in
  the entry passed to <b>calendar_add</b> which will be merged into the calendar
  file. Any existing reference to the occurrence is replaced. An occurrence that
  does not refer to a valid existing event is added as a one-off occurrence to
  the same calendar entry.</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>calendar_edit</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This calls the user's editor to edit the calendar file. If
      there are arguments, they are taken as the editor to use (the file name is

</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the calendar scheduler was running, then after editing the file <b>calendar
  -s</b> is called to update it.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This function locks out the calendar system during the edit. Hence it should be
  used to edit the calendar file if there is any possibility of a calendar event
  occurring meanwhile. Note this can lead to another shell with calendar

The function <b>age</b> can be autoloaded and use separately from the calendar

  formatting. It requires the <b>zsh/stat</b> builtin, but uses only the builtin
  <b>zstat</b>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>age</b> selects files having a given modification time for use as a glob
  qualifier. The format of the date is the same as that understood by the
  calendar system, described in the section FILE AND DATE FORMATS above.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The function can take one or two arguments, which can be supplied either
  directly as command or arguments, or separately as shell parameters.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<pre>
<b>print *(e:age 2006/10/04 2006/10/09:)</b>
</pre>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The example above matches all files modified between the start of those dates.
  The second argument may alternatively be a relative time introduced by a
  <b>+</b>:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<pre>
<b>print *(e:age 2006/10/04 +5d:)</b>

The example above is equivalent to the previous example.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In addition to the special use of days of the week, <b>today</b> and
  <b>yesterday</b>, times with no date may be specified; these apply to today.
  Obviously such uses become problematic around midnight.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<pre>
<b>print *(e-age 12:00 13:30-)</b>

<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<pre>
<b>print *(e:age 2006/10/04:)</b>
</pre>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The example above matches all files modified on that date. If the second

  argument (even if the first argument contains a time).
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<pre>
<b>print *(e-age 2006/10/04:10:15 2006/10/04:10:45-)</b>
</pre>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The example above supplies times. Note that whitespace within the time and date
  specification must be quoted to ensure <b>age</b> receives the correct
  arguments, hence the use of the additional colon to separate the date and
  time.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">

<div class="Pp"></div>
This shows the same example before using another form of argument passing. The
  dates and times in the parameters <b>AGEREF1</b> and <b>AGEREF2</b> stay in
  effect until unset, but will be overridden if any argument is passed as an
  explicit argument to age. Any explicit argument causes both parameters to be

As the system is based entirely on shell functions (with a little support from

There is no <b>calendar_delete</b> function.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There is no localization support for dates and times, nor any support for the

<div class="Pp"></div>
Relative periods of months and years do not take into account the variable
  number of days.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>calendar_show</b> function is currently hardwired to use <b>xmessage</b>
  for displaying alerts on X Window System displays. This should be configurable

<b>calendar_lockfiles</b> hangs the shell while waiting for a lock on a file. If
