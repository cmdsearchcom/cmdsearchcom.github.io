<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
zsh - the Z shell</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OVERVIEW <br>
Because zsh contains many features, the zsh manual has been
split into a number of sections:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Zsh is a UNIX command interpreter (shell) usable as an
interactive login shell and as a shell script command
processor. Of the standard shells, zsh most closely
resembles ksh <br>
but includes many enhancements. Zsh has command line
editing, builtin spelling correction, programmable command
completion, shell functions (with autoloading), a history
mecha&acirc; <br>
nism, and a host of other features.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHOR <br>
Zsh was originally written by Paul Falstad
&lt;pf@zsh.org&gt;. Zsh is now maintained by the members of
the zsh-workers mailing list &lt;zsh-workers@zsh.org&gt;.
The development is cur&acirc; <br>
rently coordinated by Peter Stephenson &lt;pws@zsh.org&gt;.
The coordinator can be contacted at
&lt;coordinator@zsh.org&gt;, but matters relating to the
code should generally go to the <br>
mailing list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AVAILABILITY <br>
Zsh is available from the following anonymous FTP sites.
These mirror sites are kept frequently up to date. The sites
marked with (H) may be mirroring ftp.cs.elte.hu instead of
<br>
the primary site.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Primary site <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MAILING LISTS <br>
Zsh has 3 mailing lists:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;zsh-announce@zsh.org&gt;
<br>
Announcements about releases, major changes in the shell and
the monthly posting of the Zsh FAQ. (moderated)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;zsh-users@zsh.org&gt; <br>
User discussions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;zsh-workers@zsh.org&gt; <br>

MAILING LISTS AS THEY ARE NESTED. All submissions to
zsh-announce are automatically forwarded to zsh-users. All
submissions to zsh-users are <br>
automatically forwarded to zsh-workers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you have problems
subscribing/unsubscribing to any of the mailing lists, send
mail to &lt;listmaster@zsh.org&gt;. The mailing lists are
maintained by Karsten Thygesen <br>
&lt;karthy@kom.auc.dk&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The mailing lists are archived;
the archives can be accessed via the administrative
addresses listed above. There is also a hypertext archive,
maintained by Geoff Wing <br>
&lt;gcw@zsh.org&gt;, available at
http://www.zsh.org/mla/.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THE ZSH FAQ <br>
Zsh has a list of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ),
maintained by Peter Stephenson &lt;pws@zsh.org&gt;. It is
regularly posted to the newsgroup comp.unix.shell and the
zsh-announce <br>
mailing list. The latest version can be found at any of the
Zsh FTP sites, or at http://www.zsh.org/FAQ/. The contact
address for FAQ-related matters is
&lt;faqmaster@zsh.org&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THE ZSH WEB PAGE <br>
Zsh has a web page which is located at http://www.zsh.org/.
This is maintained by Karsten Thygesen
&lt;karthy@zsh.org&gt;, of SunSITE Denmark. The contact
address for web-related <br>
matters is &lt;webmaster@zsh.org&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THE ZSH USERGUIDE <br>
A userguide is currently in preparation. It is intended to
complement the manual, with explanations and hints on issues
where the manual can be cabbalistic, hierographic, or <br>
downright mystifying (for example, the word
&lsquo;hierographic&rsquo; does not exist). It can be viewed
in its current state at http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Guide/.
At the time of writing, <br>
chapters dealing with startup files and their contents and
the new completion system were essentially complete.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THE ZSH WIKI <br>
A &lsquo;wiki&rsquo; website for zsh has been created at
http://www.zshwiki.org/. This is a site which can be added
to and modified directly by users without any special
permission. You <br>
can add your own zsh tips and configurations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INVOCATION <br>
The following flags are interpreted by the shell when
invoked to determine where the shell will read commands
from:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Take the first argument as a
command to execute, rather than reading commands from a
script or standard input. If any further arguments are
given, the first one is <br>
assigned to $0, rather than being used as a positional
parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i Force shell to be
interactive. It is still possible to specify a script to
execute.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Force shell to read commands
from the standard input. If the -s flag is not present and
an argument is given, the first argument is taken to be the
pathname of a script <br>
to execute.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If there are any remaining
arguments after option processing, and neither of the
options -c or -s was supplied, the first argument is taken
as the file name of a script contain&acirc; <br>
ing shell commands to be executed. If the option PATH_SCRIPT
is set, and the file name does not contain a directory path
(i.e. there is no &lsquo;/&rsquo; in the name), first the
current <br>
directory and then the command path given by the variable
PATH are searched for the script. If the option is not set
or the file name contains a &lsquo;/&rsquo; it is used
directly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After the first one or two
arguments have been appropriated as described above, the
remaining arguments are assigned to the positional
parameters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For further options, which are
common to invocation and the set builtin, see
zshoptions(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options may be specified by name
using the -o option. -o acts like a single-letter option,
but takes a following string as the option name. For
example,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zsh -x -o shwordsplit scr</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">runs the script scr, setting the
XTRACE option by the corresponding letter &lsquo;-x&rsquo;
and the SH_WORD_SPLIT option by name. Options may be turned
off by name by using +o instead of <br>
-o. -o can be stacked up with preceding single-letter
options, so for example &lsquo;-xo shwordsplit&rsquo; or
&lsquo;-xoshwordsplit&rsquo; is equivalent to &lsquo;-x -o
shwordsplit&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options may also be specified by
name in GNU long option style, &lsquo;--option-name&rsquo;.
When this is done, &lsquo;-&rsquo; characters in the option
name are permitted: they are translated into <br>
&lsquo;_&rsquo;, and thus ignored. So, for example,
&lsquo;zsh --sh-word-split&rsquo; invokes zsh with the
SH_WORD_SPLIT option turned on. Like other option syntaxes,
options can be turned off by <br>
replacing the initial &lsquo;-&rsquo; with a
&lsquo;+&rsquo;; thus &lsquo;+-sh-word-split&rsquo; is
equivalent to &lsquo;--no-sh-word-split&rsquo;. Unlike other
option syntaxes, GNU-style long options cannot be stacked
with <br>
any other options, so for example
&lsquo;-x-shwordsplit&rsquo; is an error, rather than being
treated like &lsquo;-x --shwordsplit&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The special GNU-style option
&lsquo;--version&rsquo; is handled; it sends to standard
output the shell&rsquo;s version information, then exits
successfully. &lsquo;--help&rsquo; is also handled; it sends
to <br>
standard output a list of options that can be used when
invoking the shell, then exits successfully.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Option processing may be
finished, allowing following arguments that start with
&lsquo;-&rsquo; or &lsquo;+&rsquo; to be treated as normal
arguments, in two ways. Firstly, a lone &lsquo;-&rsquo; (or
&lsquo;+&rsquo;) as an <br>
argument by itself ends option processing. Secondly, a
special option &lsquo;--&rsquo; (or &lsquo;+-&rsquo;), which
may be specified on its own (which is the standard POSIX
usage) or may be stacked <br>
with preceding options (so &lsquo;-x-&rsquo; is equivalent
to &lsquo;-x --&rsquo;). Options are not permitted to be
stacked after &lsquo;--&rsquo; (so &lsquo;-x-f&rsquo; is an
error), but note the GNU-style option form dis&acirc; <br>
cussed above, where &lsquo;--shwordsplit&rsquo; is permitted
and does not end option processing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Except when the sh/ksh emulation
single-letter options are in effect, the option
&lsquo;-b&rsquo; (or &lsquo;+b&rsquo;) ends option
processing. &lsquo;-b&rsquo; is like &lsquo;--&rsquo;,
except that further single-letter <br>
options can be stacked after the &lsquo;-b&rsquo; and will
take effect as normal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMPATIBILITY <br>
Zsh tries to emulate sh or ksh when it is invoked as sh or
ksh respectively; more precisely, it looks at the first
letter of the name by which it was invoked, excluding any
ini&acirc; <br>
tial &lsquo;r&rsquo; (assumed to stand for
&lsquo;restricted&rsquo;), and if that is &lsquo;b&rsquo;,
&lsquo;s&rsquo; or &lsquo;k&rsquo; it will emulate sh or
ksh. Furthermore, if invoked as su (which happens on certain
systems when the <br>
shell is executed by the su command), the shell will try to
find an alternative name from the SHELL environment variable
and perform emulation based on that.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In sh and ksh compatibility
modes the following parameters are not special and not
initialized by the shell: ARGC, argv, cdpath, fignore,
fpath, HISTCHARS, mailpath, MANPATH, <br>
manpath, path, prompt, PROMPT, PROMPT2, PROMPT3, PROMPT4,
psvar, status, watch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The usual zsh startup/shutdown
scripts are not executed. Login shells source /etc/profile
followed by $HOME/.profile. If the ENV environment variable
is set on invocation, $ENV <br>
is sourced after the profile scripts. The value of ENV is
subjected to parameter expansion, command substitution, and
arithmetic expansion before being interpreted as a
path&acirc; <br>
name. Note that the PRIVILEGED option also affects the
execution of startup files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options are set if
the shell is invoked as sh or ksh: NO_BAD_PATTERN,
NO_BANG_HIST, NO_BG_NICE, NO_EQUALS, NO_FUNCTION_ARGZERO,
GLOB_SUBST, NO_GLOBAL_EXPORT, <br>
NO_HUP, INTERACTIVE_COMMENTS, KSH_ARRAYS, NO_MULTIOS,
NO_NOMATCH, NO_NOTIFY, POSIX_BUILTINS, NO_PROMPT_PERCENT,
RM_STAR_SILENT, SH_FILE_EXPANSION, SH_GLOB,
SH_OPTION_LETTERS, <br>
SH_WORD_SPLIT. Additionally the BSD_ECHO and IGNORE_BRACES
options are set if zsh is invoked as sh. Also, the
KSH_OPTION_PRINT, LOCAL_OPTIONS, PROMPT_BANG, PROMPT_SUBST
and <br>
SINGLE_LINE_ZLE options are set if zsh is invoked as
ksh.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RESTRICTED SHELL <br>
When the basename of the command used to invoke zsh starts
with the letter &lsquo;r&rsquo; or the &lsquo;-r&rsquo;
command line option is supplied at invocation, the shell
becomes restricted. Emulation <br>
mode is determined after stripping the letter
&lsquo;r&rsquo; from the invocation name. The following are
disabled in restricted mode:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; changing
directories with the cd builtin</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; changing or
unsetting the PATH, path, MODULE_PATH, module_path, SHELL,
HISTFILE, HISTSIZE, GID, EGID, UID, EUID, USERNAME,
LD_LIBRARY_PATH, LD_AOUT_LIBRARY_PATH, <br>
LD_PRELOAD and LD_AOUT_PRELOAD parameters</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; specifying
command names containing /</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; specifying
command pathnames using hash</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; redirecting
output to files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; using the exec
builtin command to replace the shell with another
command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; using jobs -Z to
overwrite the shell process&rsquo; argument and environment
space</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; using the ARGV0
parameter to override argv[0] for external commands</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; turning off
restricted mode with set +r or unsetopt RESTRICTED</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These restrictions are enforced
after processing the startup files. The startup files should
set up PATH to point to a directory of commands which can be
safely invoked in the <br>
restricted environment. They may also add further
restrictions by disabling selected builtins.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Restricted mode can also be
activated any time by setting the RESTRICTED option. This
immediately enables all the restrictions described above
even if the shell still has not <br>
processed all startup files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STARTUP/SHUTDOWN FILES <br>
Commands are first read from /etc/zshenv; this cannot be
overridden. Subsequent behaviour is modified by the RCS and
GLOBAL_RCS options; the former affects all startup files,
<br>
while the second only affects global startup files (those
shown here with an path starting with a /). If one of the
options is unset at any point, any subsequent startup
file(s) <br>
of the corresponding type will not be read. It is also
possible for a file in $ZDOTDIR to re-enable GLOBAL_RCS.
Both RCS and GLOBAL_RCS are set by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Commands are then read from
$ZDOTDIR/.zshenv. If the shell is a login shell, commands
are read from /etc/zprofile and then $ZDOTDIR/.zprofile.
Then, if the shell is interac&acirc; <br>
tive, commands are read from /etc/zshrc and then
$ZDOTDIR/.zshrc. Finally, if the shell is a login shell,
/etc/zlogin and $ZDOTDIR/.zlogin are read.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a login shell exits, the
files $ZDOTDIR/.zlogout and then /etc/zlogout are read. This
happens with either an explicit exit via the exit or logout
commands, or an implicit <br>
exit by reading end-of-file from the terminal. However, if
the shell terminates due to exec&rsquo;ing another process,
the logout files are not read. These are also affected by
the <br>
RCS and GLOBAL_RCS options. Note also that the RCS option
affects the saving of history files, i.e. if RCS is unset
when the shell exits, no history file will be saved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If ZDOTDIR is unset, HOME is
used instead. Files listed above as being in /etc may be in
another directory, depending on the installation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As /etc/zshenv is run for all
instances of zsh, it is important that it be kept as small
as possible. In particular, it is a good idea to put code
that does not need to be run <br>
for every single shell behind a test of the form &lsquo;if
[[ -o rcs ]]; then ...&rsquo; so that it will not be
executed when zsh is invoked with the &lsquo;-f&rsquo;
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any of these files may be
pre-compiled with the zcompile builtin command (see
zshbuiltins(1)). If a compiled file exists (named for the
original file plus the .zwc extension) <br>
and it is newer than the original file, the compiled file
will be used instead.</p>
