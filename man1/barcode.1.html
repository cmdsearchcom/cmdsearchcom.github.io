The information below is extracted from the texinfo file, which is the preferred
  source of information.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>barcode</b> program is a front-end to access some features of the library
  from the command line. It is able to read user supplied strings from the
  command line or a data file (standard input by default) and encode all of
  them.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>

  <dd class="It-tag">Identify a file where strings to be encoded are read from.
      If missing (and if -b is not used) it defaults to standard input. Each

  <dd class="It-tag">Specify a single ``barcode'' string to be encoded. The
      option can be used multiple times in order to encode multiple strings
      (this will result in multi-page postscript output or a table of barcodes
      if -t is specified). The strings must match the encoding chosen; if it
      doesn't match the program will print a warning to stderr and generate
      ``blank'' output (although not zero-length). Please note that a string

      unspecified size results in default size. The specified values represent
      print points by default, and can be inches, millimeters or other units
      according to the -u option or the BARCODE_UNIT environment variable. The
      argument is used to place the printout code on the page. Note that an
      additional white margin of 10 points is added to the printout. If the
      option is unspecified, BARCODE_GEOMETRY is looked up in the environment,

      default to be the same as the bottom and left margin. The margins are

      option is not specified, BARCODE_TABLE is looked up in the environment,
      otherwise no table is printed and each barcode will get its own page. The
      size (but not the position) of a barcode item within a table can also be
      selected using -g (see &quot;geometry&quot; above), without struggling
      with external and internal margins. I still think management of geometries
      in a table is suboptimal, but I can't make it better without introducing

      specification as numbers will be interpreted according to the current unit
      specification (see -u below). If libpaper is available, you can also
      specify the page size with its name, like &quot;A3&quot; or
      &quot;letter&quot; (libpaper is a standard component of Debian GNU/Linux,

      behaviour is compatible with 0.92 and previous versions. If -u appears
      more than once, each instance will modified the behaviour for the
      arguments at its right, as the command line is processes left to right.
      The program internally works with points, and any size is approximated to
      the nearest multiple of one point. The -u option affect -g (geometry), -t

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ENCODING_TYPES"><a class="selflink" href="#ENCODING_TYPES">ENCODING
  TYPES</a></h1>
The program encodes text strings passed either on the command line (with -b) or
  retrieved from standard input. The text representation is interpreted
  according to the following rules. When auto-detection of the encoding is
  enabled (i.e, no explicit encoding type is specified), the encoding types are
  scanned to find one that can digest the text string. The following list of
  supported types is sorted in the same order the library uses when
  auto-detecting a suitable encoding for a string.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">EAN</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The EAN frontend is similar to UPC; it accepts strings of
      digits, 12 or 7 characters long. Strings of 13 or 8 characters are
      accepted if the provided checksum digit is correct. I expect most users to
      feed input without a checksum, though. The add-2 and add-5 extension are
      accepted for both the EAN-13 and the EAN-8 encodings. The following are
      example of valid input strings: ``123456789012'' (EAN-13),
      ``1234567890128'' (EAN-13 wih checksum), ``1234567'' (EAN-8), ``12345670
      12345'' (EAN-8 with checksum and add-5), ``123456789012 12'' (EAN-13 with
      add-2), ``123456789012 12345'' (EAN-13 with add-5).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">UPC</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The UPC frontend accepts only strings made up of digits
      (and, if a supplemental encoding is used, a blank to separate it). It
      accepts strings of 11 or 12 digits (UPC-A) and 6 or 7 or 8 digits (UPC-E).
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The 12th digit of UPC-A is the checksum and is added by the library if not
  specified in the input; if it is specified, it must be the right checksum or
  the code is rejected as invalid. For UPC-E, 6 digit are considered to be the
  middle part of the code, a leading 0 is assumed and the checksum is added; 7
  digits are either considered the initial part (leading digit 0 or 1, checksum
  missing) or the final part (checksum specified, leading 0 assumed); 8 digits
  are considered to be the complete code, with leading 0 or 1 and checksum. For
  both UPC-A and UPC-E, a trailing string of 2 digits or 5 digits is accepted as
  well. Therefore, the following are examples of valid strings that can be
  encoded as UPC: ``01234567890'' (UPC-A) ``012345678905'' (UPC-A with
  checksum), ``012345'' (UPC-E), ``01234567890 12'' (UPC-A, add-2) and
  ``01234567890 12345'' (UPC-A, add-5), ``0123456 12'' (UPC-E, add-2). Please
  note that when setting BARCODE_ANY to auto-detect the encoding to be used,
  12-digit strings and 7-digit strings will always be identified as EAN. This
  because I expect most user to provide input without a checksum. If you need to
  specify UPC-with-checksum as input you must explicitly set BARCODE_UPC as a
  flag or use -e upc on the command line.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">ISBN</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">ISBN numbers are encoded as EAN-13 symbols, with an
      optional add-5 trailer. The ISBN frontend of the library accepts real ISBN
      numbers and deals with any hyphen and, if present, the ISBN checksum
      character before encoding data. Valid representations for ISBN strings are
      for example: ``1-56592-292-1'', ``3-89721-122-X'' and ``3-89721-122-X
      06900}''.</dd>

</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">code 128-C</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The ``C'' variation of Code-128 uses Code-128 symbols to
      represent two digits at a time (Code-128 is made up of 104 symbols whose
      interpretation is controlled by the start symbol being used). Code 128-C
      is thus the most compact way to represent any even number of digits. The
      encoder refuses to deal with an odd number of digits because the caller is
      expected to provide proper padding to an even number of digits. (Since
      Code-128 includes control symbols to switch charset, it is theoretically
      possible to represent the odd digit as a Code 128-A or 128-B symbol, but
      this tool doesn't currently implement this option).</dd>

      code128 symbols, this pseudo-encoding allows the used to specify a list of
      code128 symbols separated by spaces. Each symbol is represented by a
      number in the range 0-105. The list should include the leading
      character.The checksum and the stop character are automatically added by
      the library. Most likely this pseudo-encoding will be used with
      BARCODE_NO_ASCII and some external program to supply the printed
    text.</dd>

      the blank space, plus, minus, dot, star, dollar, slash, percent. Any
      string that is only composed of such characters is accepted by the code-39
      encoder. To avoid loosing information, the encoder refuses to encode
      mixed-case strings (a lowercase string is nonetheless accepted as a
      shortcut, but is encoded as uppercase).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">interleaved 2 of 5</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This encoding can only represent an even number of digits
      (odd digits are represented by bars, and even digits by the interleaving
      spaces). The name stresses the fact that two of the five items (bars or
      spaces) allocated to each symbol are wide, while the rest are narrow. The
      checksum digit is optional (can be disabled via BARCODE_NO_CHECKSUM).
      Since the number of digits, including the checksum, must be even, a
      leading zero is inserted in the string being encoded if needed (this is
      specifically stated in the specs I have access to).</dd>

      (NUL) to 127 (DEL), as well as four special symbols, named F1, F2, F3, F4.
      The set of symbols available in this encoding is not easily represented as
      input to the barcode library, so the following convention is used. In the
      input string, which is a C-language null-terminated string, the NUL char
      is represented by the value 128 (0x80, 0200) and the F1-F4 characters are
      represented by the values 193-196 (0xc1-0xc4, 0301-0304). The values have
      been chosen to ease their representation as escape sequences.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Since the shell doesn't seem to interpret escape sequences on the command line,
  the &quot;-b&quot; option cannot be easily used to designate the strings to be
  encoded. As a workaround you can resort to the command echo, either within
  back-ticks or used separately to create a file that is then fed to the
  standard-input of barcode -- assuming your echo command processes escape
  sequences. The newline character is especially though to encode (but not
  impossible unless you use a csh variant.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
These problems only apply to the command-line tool; the use of library functions
  doesn't give any problem. In needed, you can use the ``code 128 raw''
  pseudo-encoding to represent code128 symbols by their numerical value. This
  encoding is used late in the auto-selection mechanism because (almost) any
  input string can be represented using code128.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">Codabar</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Codabar can encode the ten digits and a few special symbols
      (minus, plus, dollar, colon, bar, dot). The characters ``A'', ``B'', ``C''
      and ``D'' are used to represent four different start/stop characters. The
      input string to the barcode library can include the start and stop
      characters or not include them (in which case ``A'' is used as start and
      ``B'' as stop). Start and stop characters in the input string can be
      either all lowercase or all uppercase and are always printed as

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">code 93</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The code-93 standard can natively encode 48 different
      characters, including uppercase letters, digits, the blank space, plus,
      minus, dot, star, dollar, slash, percent, as well as five special
      characters: a start/stop delimiter and four &quot;shift characters&quot;
      used for extended encoding. Using this &quot;extended encoding&quot;
      method, any standard 7-bit ASCII character can be encoded, but it takes up
      two symbol lengths in barcode if the character is not natively supported
      (one of the 48). The encoder here fully implements the code 93 encoding
      standard. Any characters natively supported (A-Z, 0-9, &quot;.+-/$ encoded
      as such - for any other characters (such as lower case letters, brackets,
      parentheses, etc.), the encoder will revert to extended encoding. As a
      note, the option to exclude the checksum will eliminate the two modulo-47
      checksums (called C and K) from the barcode, but this probably will make
      it unreadable by 9 These checksums are specified to be used at the
      firmware level, and their absence will be interpreted as an invalid
      barcode.

  OUTPUT</a></h1>
While the default output is Postscript (possibly EPS), and Postscript can be
  post-processed to almost anything, it is sometimes desirable to create output
  directly usable by the specific printer at hand. PCL is currently supported as
  an output format for this reason. Please note that the Y coordinate for PCL
  goes from top to bottom, while for Postscript it goes from bottom to top.
  Consistently, while in Postscript you specify the bottom-left corner as
  origin, for PCL you specify the top-left corner.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>

Barcode output for PCL Printers (HP LaserJet and compatibles), was developed
  using PCL5 Reference manuals from HP. that really refers to these printers:

However, barcode printing uses a very small subset of PCL, probably also
  LaserJet II should print it without problem, but the resulting text may be
  horrible.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The only real difference from one printer to another really depends on which
  font are available in the printer, used in printing the label associated to
  the bars (if requested).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Earlier LaserJet supports only bitmaps fonts, so these are not
  &quot;scalable&quot;. (Ljet II ?), Also these fonts, when available, have a
  specified direction, and not all of them are available in both Portrait and
  Landscape mode.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
From LaserJet 4 series, (except 4L/5L that are entry-level printers), Arial
  scalable font should be available, so it's the &quot;default font&quot; used
  by this program.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
LaserJet III series printers (and 4L, 5L), don't feature &quot;Arial&quot; as a
  resident font, so you should use BARCODE_OUT_PCL_III instead of
  BARCODE_OUT_PCL., and font the font used will be &quot;Univers&quot; instead
  of &quot;Arial&quot;.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Results on compatible printers, may depend on consistency of PCL5 compatibility,
  in doubt, try BARCODE_OUT_PCL_III

The current management of borders/margins is far from optimal. The ``default''
  margin applied by the library interferes with the external representation, but
  I feel it is mandatory to avoid creating barcode output with no surrounding
  white space (the problem is especially relevant for EPS output).
