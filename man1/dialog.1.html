<p>DIALOG(1) General Commands Manual DIALOG(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
dialog - display dialog boxes from shell scripts</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
dialog --clear <br>
dialog --create-rc file <br>
dialog --print-maxsize <br>
dialog common-options box-options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Dialog is a program that will let you to present a variety
of questions or display messages using dialog boxes from a
shell script. These types of dialog boxes are implemented
<br>
(though not all are necessarily compiled into dialog):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">buildlist, calendar, checklist,
dselect, editbox, form, fselect, gauge, infobox, inputbox,
inputmenu, menu, mixedform, mixedgauge, msgbox (message),
passwordbox, <br>
passwordform, pause, prgbox, programbox, progressbox,
radiolist, rangebox, tailbox, tailboxbg, textbox, timebox,
treeview, and yesno (yes/no).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can put more than one dialog
box into a script:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Use the
&quot;--and-widget&quot; token to force dialog to proceed to
the next dialog unless you have pressed ESC to cancel,
or</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Simply add the
tokens for the next dialog box, making a chain. Dialog stops
chaining when the return code from a dialog is nonzero,
e.g., Cancel or No (see DIAGNOSTICS).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some widgets, e.g., checklist,
will write text to dialog&rsquo;s output. Normally that is
the standard error, but there are options for changing this:
&quot;--output-fd&quot;, &quot;--stderr&quot; and <br>
&quot;--stdout&quot;. No text is written if the Cancel
button (or ESC) is pressed; dialog exits immediately in that
case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
All options begin with &quot;--&quot; (two ASCII hyphens,
for the benefit of those using systems with deranged locale
support).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A &quot;--&quot; by itself is
used as an escape, i.e., the next token on the command-line
is not treated as an option. <br>
dialog --title -- --Not an option</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;--args&quot; option
tells dialog to list the command-line parameters to the
standard error. This is useful when debugging complex
scripts using the &quot;--&quot; and &quot;--file&quot;,
since the <br>
command-line may be rewritten as these are expanded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;--file&quot; option
tells dialog to read parameters from the file named as its
value. <br>
dialog --file parameterfile <br>
Blanks not within double-quotes are discarded (use
backslashes to quote single characters). The result is
inserted into the command-line, replacing &quot;--file&quot;
and its option val&acirc; <br>
ue. Interpretation of the command-line resumes from that
point. If parameterfile begins with &quot;&amp;&quot;,
dialog interprets the following text as a file descriptor
number rather than a <br>
filename.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Common Options <br>
--ascii-lines <br>
Rather than draw graphics lines around boxes, draw ASCII
&quot;+&quot; and &quot;-&quot; in the same place. See also
&quot;--no-lines&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--aspect ratio <br>
This gives you some control over the box dimensions when
using auto sizing (specifying 0 for height and width). It
represents width / height. The default is 9, which <br>
means 9 characters wide to every 1 line high.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--backtitle backtitle <br>
Specifies a backtitle string to be displayed on the
backdrop, at the top of the screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--begin y x <br>
Specify the position of the upper left corner of a dialog
box on the screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--cancel-label string <br>
Override the label used for &quot;Cancel&quot; buttons.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--clear <br>
Clears the widget screen, keeping only the screen_color
background. Use this when you combine widgets with
&quot;--and-widget&quot; to erase the contents of a previous
widget on <br>
the screen, so it won&rsquo;t be seen under the contents of
a following widget. Understand this as the complement of
&quot;--keep-window&quot;. To compare the effects, use
these:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All three widgets visible,
staircase effect, ordered 1,2,3:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dialog --begin 2 2 --yesno
&quot;&quot; 0 0 --and-widget --begin 4 4 --yesno
&quot;&quot; 0 0 --and-widget --begin 6 6 --yesno
&quot;&quot; 0 0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Only the last widget is left
visible:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dialog --clear --begin 2 2
--yesno &quot;&quot; 0 0 --and-widget --clear --begin 4 4
--yesno &quot;&quot; 0 0 --and-widget --begin 6 6 --yesno
&quot;&quot; 0 0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All three widgets visible,
staircase effect, ordered 3,2,1:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dialog --keep-window --begin 2 2
--yesno &quot;&quot; 0 0 --and-widget --keep-window --begin
4 4 --yesno &quot;&quot; 0 0 --and-widget --begin 6 6
--yesno &quot;&quot; 0 0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">First and third widget visible,
staircase effect, ordered 3,1:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dialog --keep-window --begin 2 2
--yesno &quot;&quot; 0 0 --and-widget --clear --begin 4 4
--yesno &quot;&quot; 0 0 --and-widget --begin 6 6 --yesno
&quot;&quot; 0 0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note, if you want to restore
original console colors and send your cursor home after the
dialog program has exited, use the clear (1) command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--colors <br>
Interpret embedded &quot; sequences in the dialog text by
the following character, which tells dialog to set colors or
video attributes: 0 through 7 are the ANSI used in <br>
curses: black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan and
white respectively. Bold is set by &rsquo;b&rsquo;, reset by
&rsquo;B&rsquo;. Reverse is set by &rsquo;r&rsquo;, reset by
&rsquo;R&rsquo;. Underline is set <br>
by &rsquo;u&rsquo;, reset by &rsquo;U&rsquo;. The settings
are cumulative, e.g., &quot;&quot; makes the following text
bold (perhaps bright) red. Restore normal settings with
&quot;&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--column-separator string <br>
Tell dialog to split data for radio/checkboxes and menus on
the occurrences of the given string, and to align the split
data into columns.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--cr-wrap <br>
Interpret embedded newlines in the dialog text as a newline
on the screen. Otherwise, dialog will only wrap lines where
needed to fit inside the text box.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Even though you can control line
breaks with this, Dialog will still wrap any lines that are
too long for the width of the box. Without cr-wrap, the
layout of your text <br>
may be formatted to look nice in the source code of your
script without affecting the way it will look in the
dialog.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See also the
&quot;--no-collapse&quot; and &quot;--trim&quot;
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--create-rc file <br>
When dialog supports run-time configuration, this can be
used to dump a sample configuration file to the file
specified by file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--date-format format <br>
If the host provides strftime, this option allows you to
specify the format of the date printed for the --calendar
widget. The time of day (hour, minute, second) are the <br>
current local time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--defaultno <br>
Make the default value of the yes/no box a No. Likewise,
make the default button of widgets that provide
&quot;OK&quot; and &quot;Cancel&quot; a Cancel. If
&quot;--nocancel&quot; or &quot;--visit-items&quot; <br>
are given those options overrides this, making the default
button always &quot;Yes&quot; (internally the same as
&quot;OK&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--default-button string <br>
Set the default (preselected) button in a widget. By
preselecting a button, a script makes it possible for the
user to simply press Enter to proceed through a dialog with
<br>
minimum interaction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The option&rsquo;s value is the
name of the button: ok, yes, cancel, no, help or extra.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normally the first button in
each widget is the default. The first button shown is
determined by the widget together with the
&quot;--nook&quot; and &quot;--nocancel options. If this
<br>
option is not given, there is no default button
assigned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--default-item string <br>
Set the default item in a checklist, form or menu box.
Normally the first item in the box is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--exit-label string <br>
Override the label used for &quot;EXIT&quot; buttons.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--extra-button <br>
Show an extra button, between &quot;OK&quot; and
&quot;Cancel&quot; buttons.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--extra-label string <br>
Override the label used for &quot;Extra&quot; buttons. Note:
for inputmenu widgets, this defaults to
&quot;Rename&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help Prints the help message
to the standard output and exits. The help message is also
printed if no options are given, or if an unrecognized
option is given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help-button <br>
Show a help-button after &quot;OK&quot; and
&quot;Cancel&quot; buttons, i.e., in checklist, radiolist
and menu boxes. If &quot;--item-help&quot; is also given, on
exit the return status will be the <br>
same as for the &quot;OK&quot; button, and the item-help
text will be written to dialog&rsquo;s output after the
token &quot;HELP&quot;. Otherwise, the return status will
indicate that the Help <br>
button was pressed, and no message printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help-label string <br>
Override the label used for &quot;Help&quot; buttons.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help-status <br>
If the help-button is selected, writes the checklist,
radiolist or form information after the item-help
&quot;HELP&quot; information. This can be used to
reconstruct the state of a <br>
checklist after processing the help request.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--hfile filename <br>
Display the given file using a textbox when the user presses
F1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--hline string <br>
Display the given string centered at the bottom of the
widget.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ignore <br>
Ignore options that dialog does not recognize. Some
well-known ones such as &quot;--icon&quot; are ignored
anyway, but this is a better choice for compatibility with
other imple&acirc; <br>
mentations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--input-fd fd <br>
Read keyboard input from the given file descriptor. Most
dialog scripts read from the standard input, but the gauge
widget reads a pipe (which is always standard input). <br>
Some configurations do not work properly when dialog tries
to reopen the terminal. Use this option (with appropriate
juggling of file-descriptors) if your script must <br>
work in that type of environment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--insecure <br>
Makes the password widget friendlier but less secure, by
echoing asterisks for each character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--item-help <br>
Interpret the tags data for checklist, radiolist and menu
boxes adding a column which is displayed in the bottom line
of the screen, for the currently selected item.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--keep-tite <br>
When built with ncurses, dialog normally checks to see if it
is running in an xterm, and in that case tries to suppress
the initialization strings that would make it <br>
switch to the alternate screen. Switching between the normal
and alternate screens is visually distracting in a script
which runs dialog several times. Use this option <br>
to allow dialog to use those initialization strings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--keep-window <br>
Normally when dialog performs several tailboxbg widgets
connected by &quot;--and-widget&quot;, it clears the old
widget from the screen by painting over it. Use this option
to sup&acirc; <br>
press that repainting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At exit, dialog repaints all of
the widgets which have been marked with
&quot;--keep-window&quot;, even if they are not tailboxbg
widgets. That causes them to be repainted in re&acirc; <br>
verse order. See the discussion of the &quot;--clear&quot;
option for examples.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--last-key <br>
At exit, report the last key which the user entered. This is
the curses key code rather than a symbol or literal
character. It can be used by scripts to distinguish
be&acirc; <br>
tween two keys which are bound to the same action.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--max-input size <br>
Limit input strings to the given size. If not specified, the
limit is 2048.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-cancel</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--nocancel <br>
Suppress the &quot;Cancel&quot; button in checklist,
inputbox and menu box modes. A script can still test if the
user pressed the ESC key to cancel to quit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-collapse <br>
Normally dialog converts tabs to spaces and reduces multiple
spaces to a single space for text which is displayed in a
message boxes, etc. Use this option to disable that <br>
feature. Note that dialog will still wrap text, subject to
the &quot;--cr-wrap&quot; and &quot;--trim&quot;
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-items <br>
Some widgets (checklist, inputmenu, radiolist, menu) display
a list with two columns (a &quot;tag&quot; and
&quot;item&quot;, i.e., &quot;description&quot;). This
option tells dialog to read shorter <br>
rows, omitting the &quot;item&quot; part of the list. This
is occasionally useful, e.g., if the tags provide enough
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See also --no-tags. If both
options are given, this one is ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-kill <br>
Tells dialog to put the tailboxbg box in the background,
printing its process id to dialog&rsquo;s output. SIGHUP is
disabled for the background process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-label string <br>
Override the label used for &quot;No&quot; buttons.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-lines <br>
Rather than draw lines around boxes, draw spaces in the same
place. See also &quot;--ascii-lines&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-mouse <br>
Do not enable the mouse.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-nl-expand <br>
Do not convert &quot;0 substrings of the message/prompt text
into literal newlines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-ok</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--nook Suppress the
&quot;OK&quot; button in checklist, inputbox and menu box
modes. A script can still test if the user pressed the
&quot;Enter&quot; key to accept the data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-shadow <br>
Suppress shadows that would be drawn to the right and bottom
of each dialog box.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-tags <br>
Some widgets (checklist, inputmenu, radiolist, menu) display
a list with two columns (a &quot;tag&quot; and
&quot;description&quot;). The tag is useful for scripting,
but may not help the <br>
user. The --no-tags option (from Xdialog) may be used to
suppress the column of tags from the display. Unlike the
--no-items option, this does not affect the data which <br>
is read from the script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Xdialog does not display the tag
column for the analogous buildlist and treeview widgets;
dialog does the same.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normally dialog allows you to
quickly move to entries on the displayed list, by matching a
single character to the first character of the tag. When the
--no-tags option <br>
is given, dialog matches against the first character of the
description. In either case, the matchable character is
highlighted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ok-label string <br>
Override the label used for &quot;OK&quot; buttons.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--output-fd fd <br>
Direct output to the given file descriptor. Most dialog
scripts write to the standard error, but error messages may
also be written there, depending on your script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--separator string</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--output-separatorstring <br>
Specify a string that will separate the output on
dialog&rsquo;s output from checklists, rather than a newline
(for --separate-output) or a space. This applies to other
widgets <br>
such as forms and editboxes which normally use a
newline.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--print-maxsize <br>
Print the maximum size of dialog boxes, i.e., the screen
size, to dialog&rsquo;s output. This may be used alone,
without other options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--print-size <br>
Prints the size of each dialog box to dialog&rsquo;s
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--print-version <br>
Prints dialog&rsquo;s version to dialog&rsquo;s output. This
may be used alone, without other options. It does not cause
dialog to exit by itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--quoted <br>
Normally dialog quotes the strings returned by
checklist&rsquo;s as well as the item-help text. Use this
option to quote all string results.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--scrollbar <br>
For widgets holding a scrollable set of data, draw a
scrollbar on its right-margin. This does not respond to the
mouse.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--separate-output <br>
For checklist widgets, output result one line at a time,
with no quoting. This facilitates parsing by another
program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--separate-widget string <br>
Specify a string that will separate the output on
dialog&rsquo;s output from each widget. This is used to
simplify parsing the result of a dialog with several
widgets. If this <br>
option is not given, the default separator string is a tab
character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--shadow <br>
Draw a shadow to the right and bottom of each dialog
box.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--single-quoted <br>
Use single-quoting as needed (and no quotes if unneeded) for
the output of checklist&rsquo;s as well as the item-help
text. If this option is not set, dialog uses double quotes
<br>
around each item. In either case, dialog adds backslashes to
make the output useful in shell scripts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--size-err <br>
Check the resulting size of a dialog box before trying to
use it, printing the resulting size if it is larger than the
screen. (This option is obsolete, since all new- <br>
window calls are checked).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--sleep secs <br>
Sleep (delay) for the given number of seconds after
processing a dialog box.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--stderr <br>
Direct output to the standard error. This is the default,
since curses normally writes screen updates to the standard
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--stdout <br>
Direct output to the standard output. This option is
provided for compatibility with Xdialog, however using it in
portable scripts is not recommended, since curses nor&acirc;
<br>
mally writes its screen updates to the standard output. If
you use this option, dialog attempts to reopen the terminal
so it can write to the display. Depending on the <br>
platform and your environment, that may fail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--tab-correct <br>
Convert each tab character to one or more spaces (for the
textbox widget; otherwise to a single space). Otherwise,
tabs are rendered according to the curses library&rsquo;s
in&acirc; <br>
terpretation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--tab-len n <br>
Specify the number of spaces that a tab character occupies
if the &quot;--tab-correct&quot; option is given. The
default is 8. This option is only effective for the textbox
wid&acirc; <br>
get.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--time-format format <br>
If the host provides strftime, this option allows you to
specify the format of the time printed for the --timebox
widget. The day, month, year values in this case are for
<br>
the current local time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--timeout secs <br>
Timeout (exit with error code) if no user response within
the given number of seconds. A timeout of zero seconds is
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is ignored by the
&quot;--pause&quot; widget. It is also overridden if the
background &quot;--tailboxbg&quot; option is used to setup
multiple concurrent widgets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--title title <br>
Specifies a title string to be displayed at the top of the
dialog box.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--trace filename <br>
logs the command-line parameters, keystrokes and other
information to the given file. If dialog reads a configure
file, it is logged as well. Piped input to the gauge <br>
widget is logged. Use control/T to log a picture of the
current dialog window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The dialog program handles some
command-line parameters specially, and removes them from the
parameter list as they are processed. For example, if the
first option is --trace, <br>
then that is processed (and removed) before dialog
initializes the display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--trim eliminate leading blanks,
trim literal newlines and repeated blanks from message
text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See also the
&quot;--cr-wrap&quot; and &quot;--no-collapse&quot;
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Prints dialog&rsquo;s version to the standard output, and
exits. See also &quot;--print-version&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--visit-items <br>
Modify the tab-traversal of checklist, radiolist, menubox
and inputmenu to include the list of items as one of the
states. This is useful as a visual aid, i.e., the cur&acirc;
<br>
sor position helps some users.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When this option is given, the
cursor is initially placed on the list. Abbreviations (the
first letter of the tag) apply to the list items. If you tab
to the button row, <br>
abbreviations apply to the buttons.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--yes-label string <br>
Override the label used for &quot;Yes&quot; buttons.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Box Options <br>
All dialog boxes have at least three parameters:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">text the caption or contents of
the box.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">height <br>
the height of the dialog box.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">width <br>
the width of the dialog box.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other parameters depend on the
box type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--buildlist text height width [
tag item status ] ... <br>
A buildlist dialog displays two lists, side-by-side. The
list on the left shows unselected items. The list on the
right shows selected items. As items are selected or <br>
unselected, they move between the lists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use a carriage return or the
&quot;OK&quot; button to accept the current value in the
selected-window and exit. The results are written using the
order displayed in the selected- <br>
window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The initial on/off state of each
entry is specified by status.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The dialog behaves like a menu,
using the --visit-items to control whether the cursor is
allowed to visit the lists directly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If --visit-items
is not given, tab-traversal uses two states (OK/Cancel).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If --visit-items
is given, tab-traversal uses four states
(Left/Right/OK/Cancel).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Whether or not --visit--items is
given, it is possible to move the highlight between the two
lists using the default &quot;^&quot; (left-column) and
&quot;$&quot; (right-column) keys.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On exit, a list of the tag
strings of those entries that are turned on will be printed
on dialog&rsquo;s output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the
&quot;--separate-output&quot; option is not given, the
strings will be quoted as needed to make it simple for
scripts to separate them. By default, this uses
double-quotes. <br>
See the &quot;--single-quoted&quot; option, which modifies
the quoting behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--calendar text height width day
month year <br>
A calendar box displays month, day and year in separately
adjustable windows. If the values for day, month or year are
missing or negative, the current date&rsquo;s
correspond&acirc; <br>
ing values are used. You can increment or decrement any of
those using the left-, up-, right- and down-arrows. Use
vi-style h, j, k and l for moving around the array of <br>
days in a month. Use tab or backtab to move between windows.
If the year is given as zero, the current date is used as an
initial value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On exit, the date is printed in
the form day/month/year. The format can be overridden using
the --date-format option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--checklist text height width
list-height [ tag item status ] ... <br>
A checklist box is similar to a menu box; there are multiple
entries presented in the form of a menu. Another difference
is that you can indicate which entry is currently <br>
selected, by setting its status to on. Instead of choosing
one entry among the entries, each entry can be turned on or
off by the user. The initial on/off state of each <br>
entry is specified by status.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On exit, a list of the tag
strings of those entries that are turned on will be printed
on dialog&rsquo;s output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the
&quot;--separate-output&quot; option is not given, the
strings will be quoted as needed to make it simple for
scripts to separate them. By default, this uses
double-quotes. <br>
See the &quot;--single-quoted&quot; option, which modifies
the quoting behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dselect filepath height width
<br>
The directory-selection dialog displays a text-entry window
in which you can type a directory, and above that a windows
with directory names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here filepath can be a filepath
in which case the directory window will display the contents
of the path and the text-entry window will contain the
preselected directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use tab or arrow keys to move
between the windows. Within the directory window, use the
up/down arrow keys to scroll the current selection. Use the
space-bar to copy the <br>
current selection into the text-entry window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Typing any printable characters
switches focus to the text-entry window, entering that
character as well as scrolling the directory window to the
closest match.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use a carriage return or the
&quot;OK&quot; button to accept the current value in the
text-entry window and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On exit, the contents of the
text-entry window are written to dialog&rsquo;s output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--editbox filepath height width
<br>
The edit-box dialog displays a copy of the file. You may
edit it using the backspace, delete and cursor keys to
correct typing errors. It also recognizes pageup/page&acirc;
<br>
down. Unlike the --inputbox, you must tab to the
&quot;OK&quot; or &quot;Cancel&quot; buttons to close the
dialog. Pressing the &quot;Enter&quot; key within the box
will split the corresponding line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On exit, the contents of the
edit window are written to dialog&rsquo;s output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--form text height width
formheight [ label y x item y x flen ilen ] ... <br>
The form dialog displays a form consisting of labels and
fields, which are positioned on a scrollable window by
coordinates given in the script. The field length flen and
<br>
input-length ilen tell how long the field can be. The former
defines the length shown for a selected field, while the
latter defines the permissible length of the data <br>
entered in the field.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If flen is zero,
the corresponding field cannot be altered. and the contents
of the field determine the displayed-length.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If flen is
negative, the corresponding field cannot be altered, and the
negated value of flen is used as the displayed-length.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If ilen is zero,
it is set to flen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use up/down arrows (or
control/N, control/P) to move between fields. Use tab to
move between windows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On exit, the contents of the
form-fields are written to dialog&rsquo;s output, each field
separated by a newline. The text used to fill non-editable
fields (flen is zero or <br>
negative) is not written out.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--fselect filepath height width
<br>
The fselect (file-selection) dialog displays a text-entry
window in which you can type a filename (or directory), and
above that two windows with directory names and file&acirc;
<br>
names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here filepath can be a filepath
in which case the file and directory windows will display
the contents of the path and the text-entry window will
contain the preselected <br>
filename.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use tab or arrow keys to move
between the windows. Within the directory or filename
windows, use the up/down arrow keys to scroll the current
selection. Use the space- <br>
bar to copy the current selection into the text-entry
window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Typing any printable characters
switches focus to the text-entry window, entering that
character as well as scrolling the directory and filename
windows to the closest <br>
match.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Typing the space character
forces dialog to complete the current name (up to the point
where there may be a match against more than one entry).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use a carriage return or the
&quot;OK&quot; button to accept the current value in the
text-entry window and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On exit, the contents of the
text-entry window are written to dialog&rsquo;s output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--gauge text height width
[percent] <br>
A gauge box displays a meter along the bottom of the box.
The meter indicates the percentage. New percentages are read
from standard input, one integer per line. The <br>
meter is updated to reflect each new percentage. If the
standard input reads the string &quot;XXX&quot;, then the
first line following is taken as an integer percentage, then
sub&acirc; <br>
sequent lines up to another &quot;XXX&quot; are used for a
new prompt. The gauge exits when EOF is reached on the
standard input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The percent value denotes the
initial percentage shown in the meter. If not specified, it
is zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On exit, no text is written to
dialog&rsquo;s output. The widget accepts no input, so the
exit status is always OK.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--infobox text height width <br>
An info box is basically a message box. However, in this
case, dialog will exit immediately after displaying the
message to the user. The screen is not cleared when
dia&acirc; <br>
log exits, so that the message will remain on the screen
until the calling shell script clears it later. This is
useful when you want to inform the user that some
opera&acirc; <br>
tions are carrying on that may require some time to
finish.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On exit, no text is written to
dialog&rsquo;s output. Only an &quot;OK&quot; button is
provided for input, but an ESC exit status may be
returned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--inputbox text height width
[init] <br>
An input box is useful when you want to ask questions that
require the user to input a string as the answer. If init is
supplied it is used to initialize the input <br>
string. When entering the string, the backspace, delete and
cursor keys can be used to correct typing errors. If the
input string is longer than can fit in the dialog <br>
box, the input field will be scrolled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On exit, the input string will
be printed on dialog&rsquo;s output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--inputmenu text height width
menu-height [ tag item ] ... <br>
An inputmenu box is very similar to an ordinary menu box.
There are only a few differences between them:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. The entries are not
automatically centered but left adjusted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. An extra button (called
Rename) is implied to rename the current item when it is
pressed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. It is possible to rename the
current entry by pressing the Rename button. Then dialog
will write the following on dialog&rsquo;s output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RENAMED &lt;tag&gt;
&lt;item&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--menu text height width
menu-height [ tag item ] ... <br>
As its name suggests, a menu box is a dialog box that can be
used to present a list of choices in the form of a menu for
the user to choose. Choices are displayed in the <br>
order given. Each menu entry consists of a tag string and an
item string. The tag gives the entry a name to distinguish
it from the other entries in the menu. The item <br>
is a short description of the option that the entry
represents. The user can move between the menu entries by
pressing the cursor keys, the first letter of the tag as a
<br>
hot-key, or the number keys 1-9. There are menu-height
entries displayed in the menu at one time, but the menu will
be scrolled if there are more entries than that.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On exit the tag of the chosen
menu entry will be printed on dialog&rsquo;s output. If the
&quot;--help-button&quot; option is given, the corresponding
help text will be printed if the <br>
user selects the help button.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--mixedform text height width
formheight [ label y x item y x flen ilen itype ] ... <br>
The mixedform dialog displays a form consisting of labels
and fields, much like the --form dialog. It differs by
adding a field-type parameter to each field&rsquo;s
descrip&acirc; <br>
tion. Each bit in the type denotes an attribute of the
field:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 hidden, e.g., a password
field.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 readonly, e.g., a label.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--mixedgauge text height width
percent [ tag1 item1 ] ... <br>
A mixedgauge box displays a meter along the bottom of the
box. The meter indicates the percentage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It also displays a list of the
tag- and item-values at the top of the box. See dialog(3)
for the tag values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The text is shown as a caption
between the list and meter. The percent value denotes the
initial percentage shown in the meter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">No provision is made for reading
data from the standard input as --gauge does.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On exit, no text is written to
dialog&rsquo;s output. The widget accepts no input, so the
exit status is always OK.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--msgbox text height width <br>
A message box is very similar to a yes/no box. The only
difference between a message box and a yes/no box is that a
message box has only a single OK button. You can use <br>
this dialog box to display any message you like. After
reading the message, the user can press the ENTER key so
that dialog will exit and the calling shell script can <br>
continue its operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the message is too large for
the space, dialog may allow you to scroll it, provided that
the underlying curses implementation is capable enough. In
this case, a per&acirc; <br>
centage is shown in the base of the widget.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On exit, no text is written to
dialog&rsquo;s output. Only an &quot;OK&quot; button is
provided for input, but an ESC exit status may be
returned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--pause text height width
seconds <br>
A pause box displays a meter along the bottom of the box.
The meter indicates how many seconds remain until the end of
the pause. The pause exits when timeout is reached <br>
or the user presses the OK button (status OK) or the user
presses the CANCEL button or Esc key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--passwordbox text height width
[init] <br>
A password box is similar to an input box, except that the
text the user enters is not displayed. This is useful when
prompting for passwords or other sensitive informa&acirc;
<br>
tion. Be aware that if anything is passed in
&quot;init&quot;, it will be visible in the system&rsquo;s
process table to casual snoopers. Also, it is very confusing
to the user to pro&acirc; <br>
vide them with a default password they cannot see. For these
reasons, using &quot;init&quot; is highly discouraged. See
&quot;--insecure&quot; if you do not care about your
password.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On exit, the input string will
be printed on dialog&rsquo;s output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--passwordform text height width
formheight [ label y x item y x flen ilen ] ... <br>
This is identical to --form except that all text fields are
treated as password widgets rather than inputbox
widgets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--prgbox text command height
width</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--prgbox command height width
<br>
A prgbox is very similar to a programbox.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This dialog box is used to
display the output of a command that is specified as an
argument to prgbox.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After the command completes, the
user can press the ENTER key so that dialog will exit and
the calling shell script can continue its operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If three parameters are given,
it displays the text under the title, delineated from the
scrolling file&rsquo;s contents. If only two parameters are
given, this text is omit&acirc; <br>
ted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--programbox text height
width</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--programbox height width <br>
A programbox is very similar to a progressbox. The only
difference between a program box and a progress box is that
a program box displays an OK button (but only after <br>
the command completes).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This dialog box is used to
display the piped output of a command. After the command
completes, the user can press the ENTER key so that dialog
will exit and the calling <br>
shell script can continue its operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If three parameters are given,
it displays the text under the title, delineated from the
scrolling file&rsquo;s contents. If only two parameters are
given, this text is omit&acirc; <br>
ted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--progressbox text height
width</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--progressbox height width <br>
A progressbox is similar to an tailbox, except that</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a) rather than displaying the
contents of a file, <br>
it displays the piped output of a command and</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">b) it will exit when it reaches
the end of the file <br>
(there is no &quot;OK&quot; button).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If three parameters are given,
it displays the text under the title, delineated from the
scrolling file&rsquo;s contents. If only two parameters are
given, this text is omit&acirc; <br>
ted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--radiolist text height width
list-height [ tag item status ] ... <br>
A radiolist box is similar to a menu box. The only
difference is that you can indicate which entry is currently
selected, by setting its status to on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On exit, the tag of the selected
item is written to dialog&rsquo;s output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--tailbox file height width <br>
Display text from a file in a dialog box, as in a &quot;tail
-f&quot; command. Scroll left/right using vi-style
&rsquo;h&rsquo; and &rsquo;l&rsquo;, or arrow-keys. A
&rsquo;0&rsquo; resets the scrolling.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On exit, no text is written to
dialog&rsquo;s output. Only an &quot;OK&quot; button is
provided for input, but an ESC exit status may be
returned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--rangebox text height width
list-height min-value max-value default-value <br>
Allow the user to select from a range of values, e.g., using
a slider. The dialog shows the current value as a bar (like
the gauge dialog). Tabs or arrow keys move the <br>
cursor between the buttons and the value. When the cursor is
on the value, you can edit it by:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">left/right cursor movement to
select a digit to modify</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+/- characters to
increment/decrement the digit by one</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 through 9 <br>
to set the digit to the given value</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some keys are also recognized in
all cursor positions:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">home/end <br>
set the value to its maximum or minimum</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pageup/pagedown <br>
increment the value so that the slider moves by one
column</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--tailboxbg file height width
<br>
Display text from a file in a dialog box as a background
task, as in a &quot;tail -f &amp;&quot; command. Scroll
left/right using vi-style &rsquo;h&rsquo; and
&rsquo;l&rsquo;, or arrow-keys. A &rsquo;0&rsquo; resets the
<br>
scrolling.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Dialog treats the background
task specially if there are other widgets (--and-widget) on
the screen concurrently. Until those widgets are closed
(e.g., an &quot;OK&quot;), dialog <br>
will perform all of the tailboxbg widgets in the same
process, polling for updates. You may use a tab to traverse
between the widgets on the screen, and close them
indi&acirc; <br>
vidually, e.g., by pressing ENTER. Once the non-tailboxbg
widgets are closed, dialog forks a copy of itself into the
background, and prints its process id if the &quot;--no-
<br>
kill&quot; option is given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On exit, no text is written to
dialog&rsquo;s output. Only an &quot;EXIT&quot; button is
provided for input, but an ESC exit status may be
returned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: Older versions of dialog
forked immediately and attempted to update the screen
individually. Besides being bad for performance, it was
unworkable. Some older <br>
scripts may not work properly with the polled scheme.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--textbox file height width <br>
A text box lets you display the contents of a text file in a
dialog box. It is like a simple text file viewer. The user
can move through the file by using the cursor, <br>
page-up, page-down and HOME/END keys available on most
keyboards. If the lines are too long to be displayed in the
box, the LEFT/RIGHT keys can be used to scroll the text <br>
region horizontally. You may also use vi-style keys h, j, k,
l in place of the cursor keys, and B or N in place of the
page-up and page-down keys. Scroll up/down using <br>
vi-style &rsquo;k&rsquo; and &rsquo;j&rsquo;, or arrow-keys.
Scroll left/right using vi-style &rsquo;h&rsquo; and
&rsquo;l&rsquo;, or arrow-keys. A &rsquo;0&rsquo; resets the
left/right scrolling. For more convenience, vi-style <br>
forward and backward searching functions are also
provided.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On exit, no text is written to
dialog&rsquo;s output. Only an &quot;EXIT&quot; button is
provided for input, but an ESC exit status may be
returned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--timebox text height [width
hour minute second] <br>
A dialog is displayed which allows you to select hour,
minute and second. If the values for hour, minute or second
are missing or negative, the current date&rsquo;s
correspond&acirc; <br>
ing values are used. You can increment or decrement any of
those using the left-, up-, right- and down-arrows. Use tab
or backtab to move between windows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On exit, the result is printed
in the form hour:minute:second. The format can be overridden
using the --time-format option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--treeview text height width
list-height [ tag item status depth ] ... <br>
Display data organized as a tree. Each group of data
contains a tag, the text to display for the item, its status
(&quot;on&quot; or &quot;off&quot;) and the depth of the
item in the tree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Only one item can be selected
(like the radiolist). The tag is not displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On exit, the tag of the selected
item is written to dialog&rsquo;s output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--yesno text height width <br>
A yes/no dialog box of size height rows by width columns
will be displayed. The string specified by text is displayed
inside the dialog box. If this string is too long <br>
to fit in one line, it will be automatically divided into
multiple lines at appropriate places. The text string can
also contain the sub-string &quot;0 or newline characters
<br>
&lsquo;0 to control line breaking explicitly. This dialog
box is useful for asking questions that require the user to
answer either yes or no. The dialog box has a Yes but&acirc;
<br>
ton and a No button, in which the user can switch between by
pressing the TAB key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On exit, no text is written to
dialog&rsquo;s output. In addition to the &quot;Yes&quot;
and &quot;No&quot; exit codes (see DIAGNOSTICS) an ESC exit
status may be returned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The codes used for
&quot;Yes&quot; and &quot;No&quot; match those used for
&quot;OK&quot; and &quot;Cancel&quot;, internally no
distinction is made.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Obsolete Options <br>
--beep This was used to tell the original cdialog that it
should make a beep when the separate processes of the
tailboxbg widget would repaint the screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--beep-after <br>
Beep after a user has completed a widget by pressing one of
the buttons.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RUN-TIME CONFIGURATION <br>
1. Create a sample configuration file by typing:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;dialog --create-rc
&lt;file&gt;&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. At start, dialog determines
the settings to use as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a) if environment variable
DIALOGRC is set, its value determines the name of the
configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">b) if the file in (a) is not
found, use the file $HOME/.dialogrc as the configuration
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c) if the file in (b) is not
found, try using the GLOBALRC file determined at
compile-time, i.e., /etc/dialogrc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">d) if the file in (c) is not
found, use compiled in defaults.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. Edit the sample configuration
file and copy it to some place that dialog can find, as
stated in step 2 above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KEY BINDINGS <br>
You can override or add to key bindings in dialog by adding
to the configuration file. Dialog&rsquo;s bindkey command
maps single keys to its internal coding.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bindkey widget curses_key
dialog_key</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The widget name can be
&quot;*&quot; (all widgets), or specific widgets such as
textbox. Specific widget bindings override the &quot;*&quot;
bindings. User-defined bindings override the built-in <br>
bindings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The curses_key can be any of the
names derived from curses.h, e.g., &quot;HELP&quot; from
&quot;KEY_HELP&quot;. Dialog also recognizes ANSI control
characters such as &quot;^A&quot;, &quot;^?&quot;, as well
as C1-con&acirc; <br>
trols such as &quot;~A&quot; and &quot;~?&quot;. Finally, it
allows any single character to be escaped with a
backslash.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Dialog&rsquo;s internal keycode
names correspond to the DLG_KEYS_ENUM type in dlg_keys.h,
e.g., &quot;HELP&quot; from &quot;DLGK_HELP&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Widget Names <br>
Some widgets (such as the formbox) have an area where fields
can be edited. Those are managed in a subwindow of the
widget, and may have separate keybindings from the main
wid&acirc; <br>
get because the subwindows are registered using a different
name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Widget Window name Subwindow
Name <br>
calendar calendar <br>
checklist checklist <br>
editbox editbox editbox2 <br>
form formbox formfield <br>
fselect fselect fselect2 <br>
inputbox inputbox inputbox2 <br>
menu menubox menu <br>

pause pause <br>
progressbox progressbox <br>
radiolist radiolist <br>
tailbox tailbox <br>
textbox textbox searchbox <br>
timebox timebox <br>
yesno yesno</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some widgets are actually other
widgets, using internal settings to modify the behavior.
Those use the same widget name as the actual widget:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Widget Actual Widget <br>
dselect fselect <br>
infobox msgbox <br>
inputmenu menu <br>
mixedform form <br>
passwordbox inputbox <br>
passwordform form <br>
prgbox progressbox <br>
programbox progressbox <br>
tailboxbg tailbox</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Built-in Bindings <br>
This manual page does not list the key bindings for each
widget, because that detailed information can be obtained by
running dialog. If you have set the --trace option, dialog
<br>
writes the key-binding information for each widget as it is
registered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example <br>
Normally dialog uses different keys for navigating between
the buttons and editing part of a dialog versus navigating
within the editing part. That is, tab (and back-tab)
tra&acirc; <br>
verse buttons (or between buttons and the editing part),
while arrow keys traverse fields within the editing part.
Tabs are also recognized as a special case for traversing
be&acirc; <br>
tween widgets, e.g., when using multiple tailboxbg
widgets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some users may wish to use the
same key for traversing within the editing part as for
traversing between buttons. The form widget is written to
support this sort of redefinition <br>
of the keys, by adding a special group in
&lt;code&gt;dlgk_keys.h&lt;/code&gt; for &quot;form&quot;
(left/right/next/prev). Here is an example binding
demonstrating how to do this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bindkey formfield TAB form_NEXT
<br>
bindkey formbox TAB form_NEXT <br>
bindkey formfield BTAB form_prev <br>
bindkey formbox BTAB form_prev</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">That type of redefinition would
not be useful in other widgets, e.g., calendar, due to the
potentially large number of fields to traverse.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
DIALOGOPTS Define this variable to apply any of the common
options to each widget. Most of the common options are reset
before processing each widget. If you set the op&acirc; <br>
tions in this environment variable, they are applied to
dialog&rsquo;s state after the reset. As in the
&quot;--file&quot; option, double-quotes and backslashes are
interpreted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;--file&quot; option is
not considered a common option (so you cannot embed it
within this environment variable).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIALOGRC Define this variable if
you want to specify the name of the configuration file to
use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIALOG_CANCEL</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIALOG_ERROR</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIALOG_ESC</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIALOG_EXTRA</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIALOG_HELP</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIALOG_ITEM_HELP</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIALOG_OK Define any of these
variables to change the exit code on Cancel (1), error (-1),
ESC (255), Extra (3), Help (2), Help with --item-help (2),
or OK (0). Normally <br>
shell scripts cannot distinguish between -1 and 255.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIALOG_TTY Set this variable to
&quot;1&quot; to provide compatibility with older versions
of dialog which assumed that if the script redirects the
standard output, that the &quot;--stdout&quot; <br>
option was given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
$HOME/.dialogrc default configuration file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
The dialog sources contain several samples of how to use the
different box options and how they look. Just take a look
into the directory samples/ of the source.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
Exit status is subject to being overridden by environment
variables. The default values and corresponding environment
variables that can override them are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 if dialog is exited by
pressing the Yes or OK button (DIALOG_OK).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 if the No or Cancel button is
pressed (DIALOG_CANCEL).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 if the Help button is pressed
(DIALOG_HELP).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3 if the Extra button is pressed
(DIALOG_EXTRA).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4 if the Help button is pressed
(DIALOG_HELP), or the --item-help option is set when the
Help button is pressed (DIALOG_ITEM_HELP),</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-1 if errors occur inside dialog
(DIALOG_ERROR) or dialog is exited by pressing the ESC key
(DIALOG_ESC).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PORTABILITY <br>
Dialog works with X/Open curses. However, some
implementations have deficiencies:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; HPUX curses (and
perhaps others) do not open the terminal properly for the
newterm function. This interferes with dialog&rsquo;s
--input-fd option, by preventing cursor-keys <br>
and similar escape sequences from being recognized.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; NetBSD 5.1
curses has incomplete support for wide-characters. dialog
will build, but not all examples display properly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMPATIBILITY <br>
You may want to write scripts which run with other dialog
&quot;clones&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ORIGINAL DIALOG <br>
First, there is the &quot;original&quot; dialog program to
consider (versions 0.3 to 0.9). It had some misspelled (or
inconsistent) options. The dialog program maps those
deprecated op&acirc; <br>
tions to the preferred ones. They include:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Option Treatment <br>

&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;
<br>
--beep-after ignored <br>
--guage mapped to --gauge</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">XDIALOG <br>
Technically, &quot;Xdialog&quot;, this is an X application.
With some care, it is possible to write useful scripts that
work with both Xdialog and dialog.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The dialog program ignores these
options which are recognized by Xdialog:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Option Treatment <br>

&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;
<br>
--allow-close ignored <br>
--auto-placement ignored <br>
--fixed-font ignored <br>
--icon ignored <br>
--keep-colors ignored <br>
--no-close ignored <br>
--no-cr-wrap ignored <br>
--screen-center ignored <br>
--separator mapped to --separate-output <br>
--smooth ignored <br>
--under-mouse ignored <br>
--wmclass ignored</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Xdialog&rsquo;s manpage has a
section discussing its compatibility with dialog. There are
some differences not shown in the manpage. For example, the
html documentation states</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: former Xdialog releases
used the &quot;0 (line feed) as a results separator for the
checklist widget; this has been changed to &quot;/&quot; in
Xdialog v1.5.0 so to <br>
make it compatible with (c)dialog. In your old scripts using
the Xdialog checklist, you will then have to add the
--separate-output option before the --checklist <br>
one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Dialog has not used a different
separator; the difference was likely due to confusion
regarding some script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WHIPTAIL <br>
Then there is whiptail. For practical purposes, it is
maintained by Debian (very little work is done by its
upstream developers). Its documentation (README.whiptail)
claims</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">whiptail(1) is a lightweight
replacement for dialog(1), <br>
to provide dialog boxes for shell scripts. <br>
It is built on the <br>
newt windowing library rather than the ncurses library,
allowing <br>
it to be smaller in embedded enviroments such as installers,
<br>
rescue disks, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">whiptail is designed to be
drop-in compatible with dialog, but <br>
has less features: some dialog boxes are not implemented,
such <br>
as tailbox, timebox, calendarbox, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Comparing actual sizes (Debian
testing, 2007/1/10): The total of sizes for whiptail, the
newt, popt and slang libraries is 757kb. The comparable
number for dialog (counting <br>
ncurses) is 520kb. Disregard the first paragraph.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The second paragraph is
misleading, since whiptail also does not work for common
options of dialog, such as the gauge box. whiptail is less
compatible with dialog than the orig&acirc; <br>
inal mid-1990s dialog 0.4 program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">whiptail&rsquo;s manpage borrows
features from dialog, e.g., but oddly cites only dialog
versions up to 0.4 (1994) as a source. That is, its manpage
refers to features which were bor&acirc; <br>
rowed from more recent versions of dialog, e.g.,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; --gauge (from
0.5)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; --passwordbox
(from Debian changes in 1999),</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; --default-item
(from dialog 2000/02/22),</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; --output-fd
(from dialog 2002/08/14).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Somewhat humorously, one may
note that the popt feature (undocumented in its manpage) of
using a &quot;--&quot; as an escape was documented in
dialog&rsquo;s manpage about a year before it was <br>
mentioned in whiptail&rsquo;s manpage. whiptail&rsquo;s
manpage incorrectly attributes that to getopt (and is
inaccurate anyway).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Debian uses whiptail for the
official dialog variation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The dialog program ignores or
maps these options which are recognized by whiptail:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Option Treatment <br>

&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--cancel-button mapped to
--cancel-label <br>
--fb ignored <br>
--fullbutton ignored <br>
--no-button mapped to --no-label <br>
--nocancel mapped to --no-cancel <br>
--noitem mapped to --no-items <br>
--notags mapped to --no-tags <br>
--ok-button mapped to --ok-label <br>
--scrolltext mapped to --scrollbar <br>
--topleft mapped to --begin 0 0 <br>
--yes-button mapped to --yes-label</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are visual differences
which are not addressed by command-line options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; dialog centers
lists within the window. whiptail typically puts lists
against the left margin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; whiptail uses
angle brackets (&quot;&lt;&quot; and &quot;&gt;&quot;) for
marking buttons. dialog uses square brackets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; whiptail marks
the limits of subtitles with vertical bars. dialog does not
mark the limits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; whiptail
attempts to mark the top/bottom cells of a scrollbar with
up/down arrows. When it cannot do this, it fills those cells
with the background color of the scrollbar <br>
and confusing the user. dialog uses the entire scrollbar
space, thereby getting better resolution.</p>
