<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ntpq - standard NTP query program</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ntpq [-inp] [-c command] [host] [...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The ntpq utility program is used to monitor NTP daemon ntpd
operations and determine performance. It uses the standard
NTP mode 6 control message formats defined in Appendix B of
<br>
the NTPv3 specification RFC1305. The same formats are used
in NTPv4, although some of the variables have changed and
new ones added. The description on this page is for the
NTPv4 <br>
variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The program can be run either in
interactive mode or controlled using command line arguments.
Requests to read and write arbitrary variables can be
assembled, with raw and <br>
pretty-printed output options being available. The ntpq can
also obtain and print a list of peers in a common format by
sending multiple queries to the server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If one or more request options
is included on the command line when ntpq is executed, each
of the requests will be sent to the NTP servers running on
each of the hosts given as <br>
command line arguments, or on localhost by default. If no
request options are given, ntpq will attempt to read
commands from the standard input and execute these on the
NTP <br>
server running on the first host given on the command line,
again defaulting to localhost when no other host is
specified. ntpq will prompt for commands if the standard
input is <br>
a terminal device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ntpq uses NTP mode 6 packets to
communicate with the NTP server, and hence can be used to
query any compatible server on the network which permits it.
Note that since NTP is a <br>
UDP protocol this communication will be somewhat unreliable,
especially over large distances in terms of network
topology. ntpq makes one attempt to retransmit requests, and
will <br>
time requests out if the remote host is not heard from
within a suitable timeout time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that in contexts where a
host name is expected, a -4 qualifier preceding the host
name forces DNS resolution to the IPv4 namespace, while a -6
qualifier forces DNS resolu&acirc; <br>
tion to the IPv6 namespace.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Command line options are described following. Specifying a
command line option other than -i or -n will cause the
specified query (queries) to be sent to the indicated
host(s) <br>
immediately. Otherwise, ntpq will attempt to read
interactive format commands from the standard input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-4 Force DNS resolution of
following host names on the command line to the IPv4
namespace.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-6 Force DNS resolution of
following host names on the command line to the IPv6
namespace.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c The following argument is
interpreted as an interactive format command and is added to
the list of commands to be executed on the specified
host(s). Multiple -c options <br>
may be given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i Force ntpq to operate in
interactive mode. Prompts will be written to the standard
output and commands read from the standard input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Output all host addresses in
dotted-quad numeric format rather than converting to the
canonical host names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p Print a list of the peers
known to the server as well as a summary of their state.
This is equivalent to the peers interactive command.</p>
