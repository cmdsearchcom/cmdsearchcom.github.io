l2p - Creates a PostScript file from a symbolic layout
file,or from a physical layout file.</p>

cellname</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Two main kind of cells can be used as inputs for l2p : <br>
First, you can use l2p to print symbolic layout cells. File
formats can be .ap or .cp . This is given by an environment
variable MBK_IN_PH that gives the appropriate symbolic <br>
layout file format. <br>
Second, you can use l2p to print real layout cells whose
file formats can be .cif or .gds . This is given by an
environment variable RDS_IN that gives the appropriate real
lay&acirc; <br>
out file format. <br>
The path to the input file is set up by two environment
variables: MBK_WORK_LIB(3) and if not found MBK_CATA_LIB(3).
The output of l2p is a PostScript file in the current
direc&acirc; <br>
tory. The drawing size and the paper size can be specified
by the user. So, you can split your drawing in as many pages
as wanted. The resulting file can be then used on any
ade&acirc; <br>
quat Postcript printer. <br>
l2p will generate in the current directory, either a single
file called &lt;cellname&gt;.ps, either several files
suffixed by -&lt;x&gt;x&lt;y&gt;.ps, depending on wether
you&rsquo;ve asked for a <br>
monopage plot or for a drawing that will be splitted on
several pages. If you do something like l2p -pages=2x1 cell,
it will generate two files called cell-1x1.ps, and <br>
cell-2x1.ps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
With no options, l2p generate a &rsquo;standard file&rsquo;,
with all options off. This is ok for leaf cells, but not for
large circuits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-color generates a color
PostScript file for use with color interpreters. The default
value gives a black and white PostCript file.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-drawingsize=&lt;width&gt;x&lt;height&gt;
<br>
specifies the drawing area in centh of inch. By default,
wide = 725 and height = 1068 for french A4 paper. If the
drawing size is bigger than the paper area, then the <br>
drawing will be splitted on several pages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fA3 The drawing is done on A3
format paper.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fLETTER <br>
The drawing is done on LETTER format paper.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fLEGAL <br>
The drawing is done on LEGAL format paper.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-givebwdict <br>
give the Black &amp; White internal PostScript dictionnary.
See below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-givecolordict <br>
This option must be unique on the command line. When used as
in &rsquo;l2p -givebwdict&rsquo;, l2p then gives on the
standard output its Black &amp; White internal Postscript
<br>
dictionnary. A PostScript dictionnary is a set of mac- ros
that will be used during interpretation of your PostScript
file. The macros in the internal PostScript <br>
dictionnaries of l2p allows you to control which layer to
output, how to plot rectangles, and specify the colors of
the rectangles. You get the standard diction- <br>
nary by a line of the form &rsquo;l2p -givecolordict &gt;
dict.ps&rsquo;. You can then edit it, in order to reuse it
with l2p, see the &rsquo;-usedict&rsquo; option below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-help gives you this man page
that explains how to use l2p.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-noheader <br>
prevents the border and various info, as the cellname and
the position of the page in the drawing, from being
printed.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-papersize=&lt;x_low_left&gt;x&lt;y_low_left&gt;x&lt;width&gt;x&lt;height&gt;
<br>
specifies the paper area in centh of inch. By default,
50x50x726x1069 for a4 paper.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pages=&lt;number_of_x_pages&gt;x&lt;number_of_y_pages&gt;
<br>
specifies the drawing area in pages. It can be useful,
instead of having to calculate the size in cenths of inch of
the drawing, to give it in numbers of pages. It takes <br>
care of the resizing of the paper and whether there is a
header.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-tsize=&lt;s&gt; <br>
Available sizes:6,8,10,12,14.The default value is 8.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nrname <br>
No name at all will be displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ncname <br>
The external connector&rsquo;s names won&rsquo;t be
displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nrfname <br>
The references&rsquo;s names won&rsquo;t be displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-niname <br>
The instances&rsquo;s names won&rsquo;t be displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nsname <br>
The segments&rsquo;s names won&rsquo;t be displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mfeed Manualfeed:if set,informs
the printer that it will be fed by the user himself,for each
printing .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-real uses real file (cif, gds).
By default, uses symbolic layout file (ap, cp).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-resol=&lt;x&gt; <br>
is the resolution of the file in dots per inch (dpi). This
value has been introducted to limitate the size of the
generated PostScript files. Each rectangle whose width <br>
and height are smaller than the resolution will not be
printed. The default value is 72dpi. It should only be
changed in one specifical case : when you want to produce a
<br>
plot of several meter large. Usually, you must provide a
PostScript file sized for A4 paper with a much better
resolution than 72dpi. You can then increase that value to
<br>
up to 1000dpi, but be aware that the size of the file will
probably be bigger than a 44Mb SyQuest cartridge that is
used in PAO for exchanging data files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-rflattencatal <br>
flattens the cell to the catalog level. see catal(5) for
more details on the use of the catalog file. Be careful,
this option requires a lot of memory...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-rflattentrans <br>
flattens the cell to the transistor level before printing.
Be careful, this option requires a lot more memory...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-rotate <br>
rotate the cell from 90 degree. This is useful if you have a
wide cell, and you want to have it printed in landscape
mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-scale=&lt;f.f&gt; <br>
forces the cell to be printed with a certain scale (a
floating-point number). This is very useful, when you are
printing a whole library of cells, and you want all cells
<br>
to be printed to the same scale. <br>
You can find at which scale a cell was printed by looking at
the beginning of the file : &rsquo;head n1_y-1x1.ps&rsquo;
will show you a PostScript comment beginning by <br>
&rsquo;%SCALE=3.78435&rsquo; for example.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-usedict=&lt;filename&gt; <br>
The output Postcript file contains a Postcript dictionnary
of macros. <br>
There are two standard dictionnaries used by l2p for black
and white or color prints. This allows you to use a
PostScript dictionnary different from the two internally
<br>
encoded into l2p. By modifying one of the standard l2p
dictionnary, you can choose which layer to output, how to
fill the rectangles (empty, hashed, filled), which color
<br>
to choose, ... and lots of other possibilities. The rest of
the generated postscript file is mainly orders of drawing
rectangles. PostScript is a reverse polish notation <br>
langage, that is easy to read for simple programs. <br>
If you use this functionnality, and think that your
dictionnaries are worth it, please mail them to
alliance-users@asim.lip6.fr, in order to submit them for
inclusion in <br>
future version of l2p (Thanks).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES: <br>
for symbolic file(s) : <br>
setenv MBK_IN_PH ap <br>
setenv MBK_WORK_LIB . <br>
setenv MBK_CATA_LIB /labo/cells/scr <br>
setenv MBK_CATAL_NAME CATAL <br>
setenv RDS_TECHNO_NAME cmos_1.rds</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">for real file(s) : <br>
setenv RDS_IN cif <br>
setenv MBK_CATAL_NAME CATAL_ROUT <br>
setenv RDS_TECHNO_NAME prol12_1.rds</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES: <br>
l2p -color n1_y <br>
will create a colored n1_y.ps file in the current directory
: the &rsquo;standard&rsquo; way.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">l2p -real cell <br>
will create a cell.ps file in the current directory from
cell.cif or cell.gds, depending on the RDS_IN environment
variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">l2p -pages=3x2 na2_y <br>
size of the created drawing:3 horizontal pages,2 vertical
ones;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
mbk(1), rds(1), MBK_IN_PH(3), MBK_CATA_LIB(3),
MBK_WORK_LIB(3), MBK_CATAL_NAME(3), RDS_TECHNO_NAME(3),
pageview(1), gs(1), ghostview(1), lpr(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
You will not be able to generate more than approximativly 30
pages at the same time (because of the FOPEN_MAX of your
environment). In this case, see the option that is not <br>
implemented yet. <br>
The generated PostScript is Level 1 for black&amp; white
plots. When you use color, it generates Level 1 with color
extensions. It may not run with strict Level 1 interpreters,
<br>
although it runs here with our Apple Personnal LaserWriter,
Sun Sparcprinters, and Canon CLC-300-PS. It follows the
Adobe Document Structuring Conventions 1, and as there is a
<br>
fake bitmap image inside each generated files, you can
re-use them in your word-processors, or publishing software,
because the PostScript is EPSF-1.2 compliant.</p>
