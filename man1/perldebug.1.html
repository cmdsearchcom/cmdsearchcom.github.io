<p>PERLDEBUG(1) Perl Programmers Reference Guide
PERLDEBUG(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
perldebug - Perl debugging</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
First of all, have you tried using the -w switch?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you&rsquo;re new to the Perl
debugger, you may prefer to read perldebtut, which is a
tutorial introduction to the debugger.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Perl Debugger <br>
If you invoke Perl with the -d switch, your script runs
under the Perl source debugger. This works like an
interactive Perl environment, prompting for debugger
commands that let <br>
you examine source code, set breakpoints, get stack
backtraces, change the values of variables, etc. This is so
convenient that you often fire up the debugger all by itself
just <br>
to test out Perl constructs interactively to see what they
do. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ perl -d -e 42</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In Perl, the debugger is not a
separate program the way it usually is in the typical
compiled environment. Instead, the -d flag tells the
compiler to insert source information <br>
into the parse trees it&rsquo;s about to hand off to the
interpreter. That means your code must first compile
correctly for the debugger to work on it. Then when the
interpreter <br>
starts up, it preloads a special Perl library file
containing the debugger.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The program will halt right
before the first run-time executable statement (but see
below regarding compile-time statements) and ask you to
enter a debugger command. Contrary to <br>
popular expectations, whenever the debugger halts and shows
you a line of code, it always displays the line it&rsquo;s
about to execute, rather than the one it has just
executed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any command not recognized by
the debugger is directly executed (&quot;eval&quot;&rsquo;d)
as Perl code in the current package. (The debugger uses the
DB package for keeping its own state <br>
information.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the said
&quot;eval&quot; is bound by an implicit scope. As a result
any newly introduced lexical variable or any modified
capture buffer content is lost after the eval. The <br>
debugger is a nice environment to learn Perl, but if you
interactively experiment using material which should be in
the same scope, stuff it in one line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For any text entered at the
debugger prompt, leading and trailing whitespace is first
stripped before further processing. If a debugger command
coincides with some function in <br>
your own program, merely precede the function with something
that doesn&rsquo;t look like a debugger command, such as a
leading &quot;;&quot; or perhaps a &quot;+&quot;, or by
wrapping it with parentheses <br>
or braces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Calling the Debugger <br>
There are several ways to call the debugger:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perl -d program_name <br>
On the given program identified by
&quot;program_name&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perl -d -e 0 <br>
Interactively supply an arbitrary &quot;expression&quot;
using &quot;-e&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perl -d:Ptkdb program_name <br>
Debug a given program via the &quot;Devel::Ptkdb&quot;
GUI.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perl -dt threaded_program_name
<br>
Debug a given program using threads (experimental).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Debugger Commands <br>
The interactive debugger understands the following
commands:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">h Prints out a summary help
message</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">h [command] Prints out a help
message for the given debugger command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">h h The special argument of
&quot;h h&quot; produces the entire help page, which is
quite long.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the output of the &quot;h
h&quot; command (or any command, for that matter) scrolls
past your screen, precede the command with a leading pipe
symbol so that it&rsquo;s run through <br>
your pager, as in</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DB&gt; |h h</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may change the pager which
is used via &quot;o pager=...&quot; command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">p expr Same as &quot;print
{$DB::OUT} expr&quot; in the current package. In particular,
because this is just Perl&rsquo;s own &quot;print&quot;
function, this means that nested data structures and <br>
objects are not dumped, unlike with the &quot;x&quot;
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;DB::OUT&quot;
filehandle is opened to /dev/tty, regardless of where STDOUT
may be redirected to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">x [maxdepth] expr <br>
Evaluates its expression in list context and dumps out the
result in a pretty-printed fashion. Nested data structures
are printed out recursively, unlike the real <br>
&quot;print&quot; function in Perl. When dumping hashes,
you&rsquo;ll probably prefer &rsquo;x h&rsquo; rather than
&rsquo;x %h&rsquo;. See Dumpvalue if you&rsquo;d like to do
this yourself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The output format is governed by
multiple options described under &quot;Configurable
Options&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the &quot;maxdepth&quot; is
included, it must be a numeral N; the value is dumped only N
levels deep, as if the &quot;dumpDepth&quot; option had been
temporarily set to N.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">V [pkg [vars]] <br>
Display all (or some) variables in package (defaulting to
&quot;main&quot;) using a data pretty-printer (hashes show
their keys and values so you see what&rsquo;s what, control
<br>
characters are made printable, etc.). Make sure you
don&rsquo;t put the type specifier (like &quot;$&quot;)
there, just the symbol names, like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">V DB filename line</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use &quot;~pattern&quot; and
&quot;!pattern&quot; for positive and negative regexes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is similar to calling the
&quot;x&quot; command on each applicable var.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">X [vars] Same as &quot;V
currentpackage [vars]&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">y [level [vars]] <br>
Display all (or some) lexical variables (mnemonic:
&quot;mY&quot; variables) in the current scope or level
scopes higher. You can limit the variables that you see with
vars <br>
which works exactly as it does for the &quot;V&quot; and
&quot;X&quot; commands. Requires the &quot;PadWalker&quot;
module version 0.08 or higher; will warn if this isn&rsquo;t
installed. Output is <br>
pretty-printed in the same style as for &quot;V&quot; and
the format is controlled by the same options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">T Produce a stack backtrace. See
below for details on its output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">s [expr] Single step. Executes
until the beginning of another statement, descending into
subroutine calls. If an expression is supplied that includes
function calls, it too <br>
will be single-stepped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">n [expr] Next. Executes over
subroutine calls, until the beginning of the next statement.
If an expression is supplied that includes function calls,
those functions will be <br>
executed with stops before each statement.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">r Continue until the return from
the current subroutine. Dump the return value if the
&quot;PrintRet&quot; option is set (default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;CR&gt; Repeat last
&quot;n&quot; or &quot;s&quot; command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c [line|sub] <br>
Continue, optionally inserting a one-time-only breakpoint at
the specified line or subroutine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">l List next window of lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">l min+incr List
&quot;incr+1&quot; lines starting at &quot;min&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">l min-max List lines
&quot;min&quot; through &quot;max&quot;. &quot;l -&quot; is
synonymous to &quot;-&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">l line List a single line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">l subname List first window of
lines from subroutine. subname may be a variable that
contains a code reference.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- List previous window of
lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">v [line] View a few lines of
code around the current line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">. Return the internal debugger
pointer to the line last executed, and print out that
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f filename Switch to viewing a
different file or &quot;eval&quot; statement. If filename is
not a full pathname found in the values of %INC, it is
considered a regex.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;eval&quot;ed strings (when
accessible) are a c c e s s t h e b considered to be
filenames: &quot;f (eval 7)&quot; and &quot;f eval
7oeval&quot;ed d y o f t h e 7 t h string (in the order of
<br>
execution). The bodies of the currently executed
&quot;eval&quot; and of &quot;eval&quot;ed strings that
define subroutines are saved and thus accessible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/pattern/ Search forwards for
pattern (a Perl regex); final / is optional. The search is
case-insensitive by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">?pattern? Search backwards for
pattern; final ? is optional. The search is case-insensitive
by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">L [abw] List (default all)
actions, breakpoints and watch expressions</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">S [[!]regex] <br>
List subroutine names [not] matching the regex.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">t [n] Toggle trace mode (see
also the &quot;AutoTrace&quot; option). Optional argument is
the maximum number of levels to trace below the current one;
anything deeper than that will <br>
be silent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">t [n] expr Trace through
execution of &quot;expr&quot;. Optional first argument is
the maximum number of levels to trace below the current one;
anything deeper than that will be silent. <br>
See &quot;Frame Listing Output Examples&quot; in perldebguts
for examples.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">b Sets breakpoint on current
line</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">b [line] [condition] <br>
Set a breakpoint before the given line. If a condition is
specified, it&rsquo;s evaluated each time the statement is
reached: a breakpoint is taken only if the condition <br>
is true. Breakpoints may only be set on lines that begin an
executable statement. Conditions don&rsquo;t use
&quot;if&quot;:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">b 237 $x &gt; 30 <br>
b 237 ++$count237 &lt; 11 <br>
b 33 /pattern/i</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the line number is
&quot;.&quot;, sets a breakpoint on the current line:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">b . $n &gt; 100</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">b [file]:[line] [condition] <br>
Set a breakpoint before the given line in a (possibly
different) file. If a condition is specified, it&rsquo;s
evaluated each time the statement is reached: a breakpoint
<br>
is taken only if the condition is true. Breakpoints may only
be set on lines that begin an executable statement.
Conditions don&rsquo;t use &quot;if&quot;:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">b lib/MyModule.pm:237 $x &gt; 30
<br>
b /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/CGI.pm:100 ++$count100 &lt;
11</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">b subname [condition] <br>
Set a breakpoint before the first line of the named
subroutine. subname may be a variable containing a code
reference (in this case condition is not supported).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">b postpone subname [condition]
<br>
Set a breakpoint at first line of subroutine after it is
compiled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">b load filename <br>
Set a breakpoint before the first executed line of the
filename, which should be a full pathname found amongst the
%INC values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">b compile subname <br>
Sets a breakpoint before the first statement executed after
the specified subroutine is compiled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">B line Delete a breakpoint from
the specified line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">B * Delete all installed
breakpoints.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">disable [file]:[line] <br>
Disable the breakpoint so it won&rsquo;t stop the execution
of the program. Breakpoints are enabled by default and can
be re-enabled using the &quot;enable&quot; command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">disable [line] <br>
Disable the breakpoint so it won&rsquo;t stop the execution
of the program. Breakpoints are enabled by default and can
be re-enabled using the &quot;enable&quot; command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is done for a breakpoint in
the current file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">enable [file]:[line] <br>
Enable the breakpoint so it will stop the execution of the
program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">enable [line] <br>
Enable the breakpoint so it will stop the execution of the
program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is done for a breakpoint in
the current file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a [line] command <br>
Set an action to be done before the line is executed. If
line is omitted, set an action on the line about to be
executed. The sequence of steps taken by the <br>
debugger is</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. check for a breakpoint at
this line <br>
2. print the line if necessary (tracing) <br>
3. do any actions associated with that line <br>
4. prompt user if at a breakpoint or in single-step <br>
5. evaluate line</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, this will print out
$foo every time line 53 is passed:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a 53 print &quot;DB FOUND
$foo0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A line Delete an action from the
specified line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A * Delete all installed
actions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">w expr Add a global
watch-expression. Whenever a watched global changes the
debugger will stop and display the old and new values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">W expr Delete
watch-expression</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">W * Delete all
watch-expressions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Display all options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o booloption ... <br>
Set each listed Boolean option to the value 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o anyoption? ... <br>
Print out the value of one or more options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o option=value ... <br>
Set the value of one or more options. If the value has
internal whitespace, it should be quoted. For example, you
could set &quot;o pager=&quot;less -MQeicsNfr&quot;&quot; to
call less <br>
with those specific options. You may use either single or
double quotes, but if you do, you must escape any embedded
instances of same sort of quote you began with, <br>
as well as any escaping any escapes that immediately precede
that quote but which are not meant to escape the quote
itself. In other words, you follow single-quoting <br>
rules irrespective of the quote; eg: &quot;o
option=&rsquo;this isn&acute;t bad&rsquo;&quot; or &quot;o
option=&quot;She said,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For historical reasons, the
&quot;=value&quot; is optional, but defaults to 1 only where
it is safe to do so--that is, mostly for Boolean options. It
is always better to <br>
assign a specific value using &quot;=&quot;. The
&quot;option&quot; can be abbreviated, but for clarity
probably should not be. Several options can be set together.
See &quot;Configurable <br>
Options&quot; for a list of these.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt; ? List out all pre-prompt
Perl command actions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt; [ command ] <br>
Set an action (Perl command) to happen before every debugger
prompt. A multi-line command may be entered by backslashing
the newlines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt; * Delete all pre-prompt
Perl command actions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;&lt; command Add an action
(Perl command) to happen before every debugger prompt. A
multi-line command may be entered by backwhacking the
newlines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt; ? List out post-prompt Perl
command actions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt; command Set an action (Perl
command) to happen after the prompt when you&rsquo;ve just
given a command to return to executing the script. A
multi-line command may be entered by <br>
backslashing the newlines (we bet you couldn&rsquo;t have
guessed this by now).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt; * Delete all post-prompt
Perl command actions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt;&gt; command Adds an action
(Perl command) to happen after the prompt when you&rsquo;ve
just given a command to return to executing the script. A
multi-line command may be entered by <br>
backslashing the newlines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">{ ? List out pre-prompt debugger
commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">{ [ command ] <br>
Set an action (debugger command) to happen before every
debugger prompt. A multi-line command may be entered in the
customary fashion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Because this command is in some
senses new, a warning is issued if you appear to have
accidentally entered a block instead. If that&rsquo;s what
you mean to do, write it <br>
as with &quot;;{ ... }&quot; or even &quot;do { ...
}&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">{ * Delete all pre-prompt
debugger commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">{{ command Add an action
(debugger command) to happen before every debugger prompt. A
multi-line command may be entered, if you can guess how: see
above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">! number Redo a previous command
(defaults to the previous command).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">! -number Redo number&rsquo;th
previous command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">! pattern Redo last command that
started with pattern. See &quot;o recallCommand&quot;,
too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">!! cmd Run cmd in a subprocess
(reads from DB::IN, writes to DB::OUT) See &quot;o
shellBang&quot;, also. Note that the user&rsquo;s current
shell (well, their $ENV{SHELL} variable) will be <br>
used, which can interfere with proper interpretation of exit
status or signal and coredump information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">source file Read and execute
debugger commands from file. file may itself contain
&quot;source&quot; commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">H -number Display last n
commands. Only commands longer than one character are
listed. If number is omitted, list them all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">q or ^D Quit. (&quot;quit&quot;
doesn&rsquo;t work for this, unless you&rsquo;ve made an
alias) This is the only supported way to exit the debugger,
though typing &quot;exit&quot; twice might work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Set the &quot;inhibit_exit&quot;
option to 0 if you want to be able to step off the end the
script. You may also need to set $finished to 0 if you want
to step through global <br>
destruction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">R Restart the debugger by
&quot;exec()&quot;ing a new session. We try to maintain your
history across this, but internal settings and command-line
options may be lost.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following setting are
currently preserved: history, breakpoints, actions, debugger
options, and the Perl command-line options -w, -I, and
-e.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">|dbcmd Run the debugger command,
piping DB::OUT into your current pager.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">||dbcmd Same as
&quot;|dbcmd&quot; but DB::OUT is temporarily
&quot;select&quot;ed as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">= [alias value] <br>
Define a command alias, like</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">= quit q</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or list current aliases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">command Execute command as a
Perl statement. A trailing semicolon will be supplied. If
the Perl statement would otherwise be confused for a Perl
debugger, use a leading <br>
semicolon, too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">m expr List which methods may be
called on the result of the evaluated expression. The
expression may evaluated to a reference to a blessed object,
or to a package name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">M Display all loaded modules and
their versions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">man [manpage] <br>
Despite its name, this calls your system&rsquo;s default
documentation viewer on the given page, or on the viewer
itself if manpage is omitted. If that viewer is man, the
<br>
current &quot;Config&quot; information is used to invoke man
using the proper MANPATH or -M manpath option. Failed
lookups of the form &quot;XXX&quot; that match known
manpages of the <br>
form perlXXX will be retried. This lets you type &quot;man
debug&quot; or &quot;man op&quot; from the debugger.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On systems traditionally bereft
of a usable man command, the debugger invokes perldoc.
Occasionally this determination is incorrect due to
recalcitrant vendors or <br>
rather more felicitously, to enterprising users. If you fall
into either category, just manually set the $DB::doccmd
variable to whatever viewer to view the Perl <br>
documentation on your system. This may be set in an rc file,
or through direct assignment. We&rsquo;re still waiting for
a working example of something along the lines <br>
of:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$DB::doccmd = &rsquo;netscape
-remote http://something.here/&rsquo;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Configurable Options <br>
The debugger has numerous options settable using the
&quot;o&quot; command, either interactively or from the
environment or an rc file. (./.perldb or ~/.perldb under
Unix.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;recallCommand&quot;,
&quot;ShellBang&quot; <br>
The characters used to recall command or spawn shell. By
default, both are set to &quot;!&quot;, which is
unfortunate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;pager&quot; Program to use
for output of pager-piped commands (those beginning with a
&quot;|&quot; character.) By default, $ENV{PAGER} will be
used. Because the debugger uses your <br>
current terminal characteristics for bold and underlining,
if the chosen pager does not pass escape sequences through
unchanged, the output of some debugger commands <br>
will not be readable when sent through the pager.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;tkRunning&quot; Run Tk
while prompting (with ReadLine).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;signalLevel&quot;,
&quot;warnLevel&quot;, &quot;dieLevel&quot; <br>
Level of verbosity. By default, the debugger leaves your
exceptions and warnings alone, because altering them can
break correctly running programs. It will attempt <br>
to print a message when uncaught INT, BUS, or SEGV signals
arrive. (But see the mention of signals in &quot;BUGS&quot;
below.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To disable this default safe
mode, set these values to something higher than 0. At a
level of 1, you get backtraces upon receiving any kind of
warning (this is often <br>
annoying) or exception (this is often valuable).
Unfortunately, the debugger cannot discern fatal exceptions
from non-fatal ones. If &quot;dieLevel&quot; is even 1, then
your <br>
non-fatal exceptions are also traced and unceremoniously
altered if they came from &quot;eval&rsquo;ed&quot; strings
or from any kind of &quot;eval&quot; within modules
you&rsquo;re attempting to <br>
load. If &quot;dieLevel&quot; is 2, the debugger
doesn&rsquo;t care where they came from: It usurps your
exception handler and prints out a trace, then modifies all
exceptions with <br>
its own embellishments. This may perhaps be useful for some
tracing purposes, but tends to hopelessly destroy any
program that takes its exception handling <br>
seriously.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;AutoTrace&quot; Trace mode
(similar to &quot;t&quot; command, but can be put into
&quot;PERLDB_OPTS&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;LineInfo&quot; File or
pipe to print line number info to. If it is a pipe (say,
&quot;|visual_perl_db&quot;), then a short message is used.
This is the mechanism used to interact with a <br>
slave editor or visual debugger, such as the special
&quot;vi&quot; or &quot;emacs&quot; hooks, or the
&quot;ddd&quot; graphical debugger.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;inhibit_exit&quot; <br>
If 0, allows stepping off the end of the script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;PrintRet&quot; Print
return value after &quot;r&quot; command if set
(default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;ornaments&quot; Affects
screen appearance of the command line (see Term::ReadLine).
There is currently no way to disable these, which can render
some output illegible on some <br>
displays, or with some pagers. This is considered a bug.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;frame&quot; Affects the
printing of messages upon entry and exit from subroutines.
If &quot;frame &amp; 2&quot; is false, messages are printed
on entry only. (Printing on exit might be useful <br>
if interspersed with other messages.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If &quot;frame &amp; 4&quot;,
arguments to functions are printed, plus context and caller
info. If &quot;frame &amp; 8&quot;, overloaded
&quot;stringify&quot; and &quot;tie&quot;d &quot;FETCH&quot;
is enabled on the printed <br>
arguments. If &quot;frame &amp; 16&quot;, the return value
from the subroutine is printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The length at which the argument
list is truncated is governed by the next option:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;maxTraceLen&quot; <br>
Length to truncate the argument list when the
&quot;frame&quot; option&rsquo;s bit 4 is set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;windowSize&quot; <br>
Change the size of code list window (default is 10
lines).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options affect
what happens with &quot;V&quot;, &quot;X&quot;, and
&quot;x&quot; commands:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;arrayDepth&quot;,
&quot;hashDepth&quot; <br>
Print only first N elements (&rsquo;&rsquo; for all).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;dumpDepth&quot; Limit
recursion depth to N levels when dumping structures.
Negative values are interpreted as infinity. Default:
infinity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;compactDump&quot;,
&quot;veryCompact&quot; <br>
Change the style of array and hash output. If
&quot;compactDump&quot;, short array may be printed on one
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;globPrint&quot; Whether to
print contents of globs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;DumpDBFiles&quot; <br>
Dump arrays holding debugged files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;DumpPackages&quot; <br>
Dump symbol tables of packages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;DumpReused&quot; <br>
Dump contents of &quot;reused&quot; addresses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;quote&quot;,
&quot;HighBit&quot;, &quot;undefPrint&quot; <br>
Change the style of string dump. The default value for
&quot;quote&quot; is &quot;auto&quot;; one can enable
double-quotish or single-quotish format by setting it to
&quot;&quot;&quot; or &quot;&rsquo;&quot;, <br>
respectively. By default, characters with their high bit set
are printed verbatim.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;UsageOnly&quot;
Rudimentary per-package memory usage dump. Calculates total
size of strings found in variables in the package. This does
not include lexicals in a module&rsquo;s file <br>
scope, or lost in closures.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After the rc file is read, the
debugger reads the $ENV{PERLDB_OPTS} environment variable
and parses this as the remainder of a &quot;O ...&quot; line
as one might enter at the debugger <br>
prompt. You may place the initialization options
&quot;TTY&quot;, &quot;noTTY&quot;, &quot;ReadLine&quot;,
and &quot;NonStop&quot; there.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If your rc file contains:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">parse_options(&quot;NonStop=1
LineInfo=db.out AutoTrace&quot;);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">then your script will run
without human intervention, putting trace information into
the file db.out. (If you interrupt it, you&rsquo;d better
reset &quot;LineInfo&quot; to /dev/tty if you <br>
expect to see anything.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;TTY&quot; The TTY to use
for debugging I/O.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;noTTY&quot; If set, the
debugger goes into &quot;NonStop&quot; mode and will not
connect to a TTY. If interrupted (or if control goes to the
debugger via explicit setting of $DB::signal <br>
or $DB::single from the Perl script), it connects to a TTY
specified in the &quot;TTY&quot; option at startup, or to a
tty found at runtime using the &quot;Term::Rendezvous&quot;
module <br>
of your choice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This module should implement a
method named &quot;new&quot; that returns an object with two
methods: &quot;IN&quot; and &quot;OUT&quot;. These should
return filehandles to use for debugging input <br>
and output correspondingly. The &quot;new&quot; method
should inspect an argument containing the value of
$ENV{PERLDB_NOTTY} at startup, or
&quot;$ENV{HOME}/.perldbtty$$&quot; <br>
otherwise. This file is not inspected for proper ownership,
so security hazards are theoretically possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;ReadLine&quot; If false,
readline support in the debugger is disabled in order to
debug applications that themselves use ReadLine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;NonStop&quot; If set, the
debugger goes into non-interactive mode until interrupted,
or programmatically by setting $DB::signal or
$DB::single.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here&rsquo;s an example of using
the $ENV{PERLDB_OPTS} variable:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ PERLDB_OPTS=&quot;NonStop
frame=2&quot; perl -d myprogram</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">That will run the script
myprogram without human intervention, printing out the call
tree with entry and exit points. Note that &quot;NonStop=1
frame=2&quot; is equivalent to &quot;N f=2&quot;, and <br>
that originally, options could be uniquely abbreviated by
the first letter (modulo the &quot;Dump*&quot; options). It
is nevertheless recommended that you always spell them out
in full <br>
for legibility and future compatibility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other examples include</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ PERLDB_OPTS=&quot;NonStop
LineInfo=listing frame=2&quot; perl -d myprogram</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">which runs script
non-interactively, printing info on each entry into a
subroutine and each executed line into the file named
listing. (If you interrupt it, you would better <br>
reset &quot;LineInfo&quot; to something
&quot;interactive&quot;!)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other examples include (using
standard shell syntax to show environment variable
settings):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ ( PERLDB_OPTS=&quot;NonStop
frame=1 AutoTrace LineInfo=tperl.out&quot; <br>
perl -d myprogram )</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">which may be useful for
debugging a program that uses &quot;Term::ReadLine&quot;
itself. Do not forget to detach your shell from the TTY in
the window that corresponds to /dev/ttyXX, say, <br>
by issuing a command like</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ sleep 1000000</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See &quot;Debugger
Internals&quot; in perldebguts for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Debugger Input/Output <br>
Prompt The debugger prompt is something like</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DB&lt;8&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or even</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DB&lt;&lt;17&gt;&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where that number is the command
number, and which you&rsquo;d use to access with the
built-in csh-like history mechanism. For example,
&quot;!17&quot; would repeat command number 17. <br>
The depth of the angle brackets indicates the nesting depth
of the debugger. You could get more than one set of
brackets, for example, if you&rsquo;d already at a
breakpoint <br>
and then printed the result of a function call that itself
has a breakpoint, or you step into an expression via
&quot;s/n/t expression&quot; command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Multiline commands <br>
If you want to enter a multi-line command, such as a
subroutine definition with several statements or a format,
escape the newline that would normally end the debugger <br>
command with a backslash. Here&rsquo;s an example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DB&lt;1&gt; for (1..4) { cont:
print &quot;ok0; cont: } <br>
ok <br>
ok <br>
ok <br>
ok</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that this business of
escaping a newline is specific to interactive commands typed
into the debugger.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Stack backtrace <br>
Here&rsquo;s an example of what a stack backtrace via
&quot;T&quot; command might look like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ = main::infested called from
file &rsquo;Ambulation.pm&rsquo; line 10 <br>
@ = Ambulation::legs(1, 2, 3, 4) called from file
&rsquo;camel_flea&rsquo; line 7 <br>
$ = main::pests(&rsquo;bactrian&rsquo;, 4) called from file
&rsquo;camel_flea&rsquo; line 4</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The left-hand character up there
indicates the context in which the function was called, with
&quot;$&quot; and &quot;@&quot; meaning scalar or list
contexts respectively, and &quot;.&quot; meaning <br>
void context (which is actually a sort of scalar context).
The display above says that you were in the function
&quot;main::infested&quot; when you ran the stack dump, and
that it <br>
was called in scalar context from line 10 of the file
Ambulation.pm, but without any arguments at all, meaning it
was called as &amp;infested. The next stack frame shows <br>
that the function &quot;Ambulation::legs&quot; was called in
list context from the camel_flea file with four arguments.
The last stack frame shows that &quot;main::pests&quot; was
called in <br>
scalar context, also from camel_flea, but from line 4.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you execute the &quot;T&quot;
command from inside an active &quot;use&quot; statement, the
backtrace will contain both a &quot;require&quot; frame and
an &quot;eval&quot; frame.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Line Listing Format <br>
This shows the sorts of output the &quot;l&quot; command can
produce:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DB&lt;&lt;13&gt;&gt; l <br>
101: @i{@i} = (); <br>
102:b @isa{@i,$pack} = () <br>
103 if(exists $i{$prevpack} || exists $isa{$pack}); <br>
104 } <br>
105 <br>
106 next <br>
107==&gt; if(exists $isa{$pack}); <br>
108 <br>
109:a if ($extra-- &gt; 0) { <br>
110: %isa = ($pack,1);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Breakable lines are marked with
&quot;:&quot;. Lines with breakpoints are marked by
&quot;b&quot; and those with actions by &quot;a&quot;. The
line that&rsquo;s about to be executed is marked by
&quot;==&gt;&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please be aware that code in
debugger listings may not look the same as your original
source code. Line directives and external source filters can
alter the code before <br>
Perl sees it, causing code to move from its original
positions or take on entirely different forms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Frame listing <br>
When the &quot;frame&quot; option is set, the debugger would
print entered (and optionally exited) subroutines in
different styles. See perldebguts for incredibly long
examples of <br>
these.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Debugging Compile-Time
Statements <br>
If you have compile-time executable statements (such as code
within BEGIN, UNITCHECK and CHECK blocks or &quot;use&quot;
statements), these will not be stopped by debugger, although
<br>
&quot;require&quot;s and INIT blocks will, and compile-time
statements can be traced with the &quot;AutoTrace&quot;
option set in &quot;PERLDB_OPTS&quot;). From your own Perl
code, however, you can transfer <br>
control back to the debugger using the following statement,
which is harmless if the debugger is not running:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$DB::single = 1;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you set $DB::single to 2,
it&rsquo;s equivalent to having just typed the &quot;n&quot;
command, whereas a value of 1 means the &quot;s&quot;
command. The $DB::trace variable should be set to 1 to <br>
simulate having typed the &quot;t&quot; command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another way to debug
compile-time code is to start the debugger, set a breakpoint
on the load of some module:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DB&lt;7&gt; b load
f:/perllib/lib/Carp.pm <br>
Will stop on load of
&rsquo;f:/perllib/lib/Carp.pm&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and then restart the debugger
using the &quot;R&quot; command (if possible). One can use
&quot;b compile subname&quot; for the same purpose.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Debugger Customization <br>
The debugger probably contains enough configuration hooks
that you won&rsquo;t ever have to modify it yourself. You
may change the behaviour of the debugger from within the
debugger <br>
using its &quot;o&quot; command, from the command line via
the &quot;PERLDB_OPTS&quot; environment variable, and from
customization files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can do some customization by
setting up a .perldb file, which contains initialization
code. For instance, you could make aliases like these (the
last one is one people <br>
expect to be there):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$DB::alias{&rsquo;len&rsquo;} =
&rsquo;s/^len(.*)/p length($1)/&rsquo;; <br>
$DB::alias{&rsquo;stop&rsquo;} = &rsquo;s/^stop
(at|in)/b/&rsquo;; p s c <br>
$DB::alias{&rsquo;ps&rsquo;} = &rsquo;s/^psa&rsquo;; l a r
<br>
$DB::alias{&rsquo;quit&rsquo;} =
&rsquo;s/^quit()/exit/&rsquo;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can change options from
.perldb by using calls like this one;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">parse_options(&quot;NonStop=1
LineInfo=db.out AutoTrace=1 frame=2&quot;);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The code is executed in the
package &quot;DB&quot;. Note that .perldb is processed
before processing &quot;PERLDB_OPTS&quot;. If .perldb
defines the subroutine &quot;afterinit&quot;, that function
is called <br>
after debugger initialization ends. .perldb may be contained
in the current directory, or in the home directory. Because
this file is sourced in by Perl and may contain <br>
arbitrary commands, for security reasons, it must be owned
by the superuser or the current user, and writable by no one
but its owner.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can mock TTY input to
debugger by adding arbitrary commands to @DB::typeahead. For
example, your .perldb file might contain:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sub afterinit { push
@DB::typeahead, &quot;b 4&quot;, &quot;b 6&quot;; }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Which would attempt to set
breakpoints on lines 4 and 6 immediately after debugger
initialization. Note that @DB::typeahead is not a supported
interface and is subject to change <br>
in future releases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to modify the
debugger, copy perl5db.pl from the Perl library to another
name and hack it to your heart&rsquo;s content. You&rsquo;ll
then want to set your &quot;PERL5DB&quot; environment <br>
variable to say something like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BEGIN { require
&quot;myperl5db.pl&quot; }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As a last resort, you could also
use &quot;PERL5DB&quot; to customize the debugger by
directly setting internal variables or calling debugger
functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that any variables and
functions that are not documented in this document (or in
perldebguts) are considered for internal use only, and as
such are subject to change without <br>
notice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Readline Support / History in
the Debugger <br>
As shipped, the only command-line history supplied is a
simplistic one that checks for leading exclamation points.
However, if you install the Term::ReadKey and Term::ReadLine
<br>
modules from CPAN (such as Term::ReadLine::Gnu,
Term::ReadLine::Perl, ...) you will have full editing
capabilities much like those GNU readline(3) provides. Look
for these in <br>
the modules/by-module/Term directory on CPAN. These do not
support normal vi command-line editing, however.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A rudimentary command-line
completion is also available, including lexical variables in
the current scope if the &quot;PadWalker&quot; module is
installed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Without Readline support you may
see the symbols &quot;^[[A&quot;, &quot;^[[C&quot;,
&quot;^[[B&quot;, &quot;^[[D&quot;&quot;, &quot;^H&quot;,
... when using the arrow keys and/or the backspace key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Editor Support for Debugging
<br>
If you have the FSF&rsquo;s version of emacs installed on
your system, it can interact with the Perl debugger to
provide an integrated software development environment
reminiscent of <br>
its interactions with C debuggers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Recent versions of Emacs come
with a start file for making emacs act like a
syntax-directed editor that understands (some of)
Perl&rsquo;s syntax. See perlfaq3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A similar setup by Tom
Christiansen for interacting with any vendor-shipped vi and
the X11 window system is also available. This works
similarly to the integrated multiwindow <br>
support that emacs provides, where the debugger drives the
editor. At the time of this writing, however, that
tool&rsquo;s eventual location in the Perl distribution was
uncertain.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Users of vi should also look
into vim and gvim, the mousey and windy version, for
coloring of Perl keywords.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that only perl can truly
parse Perl, so all such CASE tools fall somewhat short of
the mark, especially if you don&rsquo;t program your Perl as
a C programmer might.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Perl Profiler <br>
If you wish to supply an alternative debugger for Perl to
run, invoke your script with a colon and a package argument
given to the -d flag. Perl&rsquo;s alternative debuggers
include <br>
a Perl profiler, Devel::NYTProf, which is available
separately as a CPAN distribution. To profile your Perl
program in the file mycode.pl, just type:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ perl -d:NYTProf mycode.pl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the script terminates the
profiler will create a database of the profile information
that you can turn into reports using the profiler&rsquo;s
tools. See &lt;perlperf&gt; for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Debugging Regular Expressions
<br>
&quot;use re &rsquo;debug&rsquo;&quot; enables you to see
the gory details of how the Perl regular expression engine
works. In order to understand this typically voluminous
output, one must not only <br>
have some idea about how regular expression matching works
in general, but also know how Perl&rsquo;s regular
expressions are internally compiled into an automaton. These
matters are <br>
explored in some detail in &quot;Debugging Regular
Expressions&quot; in perldebguts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Debugging Memory Usage <br>
Perl contains internal support for reporting its own memory
usage, but this is a fairly advanced concept that requires
some understanding of how memory allocation works. See <br>
&quot;Debugging Perl Memory Usage&quot; in perldebguts for
the details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
You did try the -w switch, didn&rsquo;t you?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perldebtut, perldebguts, re, DB,
Devel::NYTProf, Dumpvalue, and perlrun.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When debugging a script that
uses #! and is thus normally found in $PATH, the -S option
causes perl to search $PATH for it, so you don&rsquo;t have
to type the path or &quot;which <br>
$scriptname&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ perl -Sd foo.pl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
You cannot get stack frame information or in any fashion
debug functions that were not compiled by Perl, such as
those from C or C++ extensions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you alter your @_ arguments
in a subroutine (such as with &quot;shift&quot; or
&quot;pop&quot;), the stack backtrace will not show the
original values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The debugger does not currently
work in conjunction with the -W command-line switch, because
it itself is not free of warnings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you&rsquo;re in a slow
syscall (like &quot;wait&quot;ing, &quot;accept&quot;ing, or
&quot;read&quot;ing from your keyboard or a socket) and
haven&rsquo;t set up your own $SIG{INT} handler, then you
won&rsquo;t be able to <br>
CTRL-C your way back to the debugger, because the
debugger&rsquo;s own $SIG{INT} handler doesn&rsquo;t
understand that it needs to raise an exception to longjmp(3)
out of slow syscalls.</p>
