<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
bitmap, bmtoa, atobm - bitmap editor and converter utilities
for the X Window System</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
bitmap [ -options ... ] [ filename ] [ basename ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bmtoa [ -chars ... ] [ filename
]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">atobm [ -chars cc ] [ -name
variable ] [ -xhot number ] [ -yhot number ] [ filename
]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The bitmap program is a rudimentary tool for creating or
editing rectangular images made up of 1&rsquo;s and
0&rsquo;s. Bitmaps are used in X for defining clipping
regions, cursor shapes, <br>
icon shapes, and tile and stipple patterns.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The bmtoa and atobm filters
convert bitmap files (FILE FORMAT) to and from ASCII
strings. They are most commonly used to quickly print out
bitmaps and to generate versions for <br>
including in text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMAND LINE OPTIONS <br>
Bitmap supports the standard X Toolkit command line
arguments (see X(7)). The following additional arguments are
supported as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-size WIDTHxHEIGHT <br>
Specifies size of the grid in squares.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sw dimension <br>
Specifies the width of squares in pixels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sh dimension <br>
Specifies the height of squares in pixels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-gt dimension <br>
Grid tolerance. If the square dimensions fall below the
specified value, grid will be automatically turned off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-grid, +grid <br>
Turns on or off the grid lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-axes, +axes <br>
Turns on or off the major axes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dashed, +dashed <br>
Turns on or off dashing for the frame and grid lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-stippled, +stippled <br>
Turns on or off stippling of highlighted squares.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-proportional, +proportional
<br>
Turns proportional mode on or off. If proportional mode is
on, square width is equal to square height. If proportional
mode is off, bitmap will use the smaller square <br>
dimension, if they were initially different.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dashes filename <br>
Specifies the bitmap to be used as a stipple for
dashing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-stipple filename <br>
Specifies the bitmap to be used as a stipple for
highlighting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-hl color <br>
Specifies the color used for highlighting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fr color <br>
Specifies the color used for the frame and grid lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">filename <br>
Specifies the bitmap to be initially loaded into the
program. If the file does not exist, bitmap will assume it
is a new file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">basename <br>
Specifies the basename to be used in the C code output file.
If it is different than the basename in the working file,
bitmap will change it when saving the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bmtoa accepts the following
option:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-chars cc <br>
This option specifies the pair of characters to use in the
string version of the bitmap. The first character is used
for 0 bits and the second character is used for 1 bits. <br>
The default is to use dashes (-) for 0&rsquo;s and sharp
signs (#) for 1&rsquo;s.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Atobm accepts the following
options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-chars cc <br>
This option specifies the pair of characters to use when
converting string bitmaps into arrays of numbers. The first
character represents a 0 bit and the second character <br>
represents a 1 bit. The default is to use dashes (-) for
0&rsquo;s and sharp signs (#) for 1&rsquo;s.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-name variable <br>
This option specifies the variable name to be used when
writing out the bitmap file. The default is to use the
basename of the filename command line argument or leave it
<br>
blank if the standard input is read.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-xhot number <br>
This option specifies the X coordinate of the hotspot. Only
positive values are allowed. By default, no hotspot
information is included.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-yhot number <br>
This option specifies the Y coordinate of the hotspot. Only
positive values are allowed. By default, no hotspot
information is included.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USAGE <br>
Bitmap displays grid in which each square represents a
single bit in the picture being edited. Actual size of the
bitmap image, as it would appear normally and inverted, can
be <br>
obtained by pressing Meta-I key. You are free to move the
image popup out of the way to continue editing. Pressing the
left mouse button in the popup window or Meta-I again <br>
will remove the real size bitmap image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the bitmap is to be used for
defining a cursor, one of the squares in the images may be
designated as the hot spot. This determines where the cursor
is actually pointing. <br>
For cursors with sharp tips (such as arrows or fingers),
this is usually at the end of the tip; for symmetric cursors
(such as crosses or bullseyes), this is usually at the
cen&acirc; <br>
ter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bitmaps are stored as small C
code fragments suitable for including in applications. They
provide an array of bits as well as symbolic constants
giving the width, height, and <br>
hot spot (if specified) that may be used in creating
cursors, icons, and tiles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EDITING <br>
To edit a bitmap image simply click on one of the buttons
with drawing commands (Point, Curve, Line, Rectangle, etc.)
and move the pointer into the bitmap grid window. Press one
<br>
of the buttons on your mouse and the appropriate action will
take place. You can either set, clear or invert the gird
squares. Setting a grid square corresponds to setting a <br>
bit in the bitmap image to 1. Clearing a grid square
corresponds to setting a bit in the bitmap image to 0.
Inverting a grid square corresponds to changing a bit in the
bitmap <br>
image from 0 to 1 or 1 to 0, depending what its previous
state was. The default behavior of mouse buttons is as
specified below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MouseButton1 Set <br>
MouseButton2 Invert <br>
MouseButton3 Clear <br>
MouseButton4 Clear <br>
MouseButton5 Clear</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This default behavior can be
changed by setting the button function resources. An example
is provided below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bitmap*button1Function: Set <br>
bitmap*button2Function: Clear <br>
bitmap*button3Function: Invert <br>
etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The button function applies to
all drawing commands, including copying, moving and pasting,
flood filling and setting the hot spot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DRAWING COMMANDS <br>
Here is the list of drawing commands accessible through the
buttons at the left side of the application&rsquo;s window.
Some commands can be aborted by pressing A inside the bitmap
<br>
window, allowing the user to select different guiding points
where applicable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Clear <br>
This command clears all bits in the bitmap image. The grid
squares will be set to the background color. Pressing C
inside the bitmap window has the same effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Set This command sets all bits
in the bitmap image. The grid squares will be set to the
foreground color. Pressing S inside the bitmap window has
the same effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Invert <br>
This command inverts all bits in the bitmap image. The grid
squares will be inverted appropriately. Pressing I inside
the bitmap window has the same effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mark <br>
This command is used to mark an area of the grid by dragging
out a rectangular shape in the highlighting color. Once the
area is marked, it can be operated on by a number of <br>
commands (see Up, Down, Left, Right, Rotate, Flip, Cut,
etc.) Only one marked area can be present at any time. If
you attempt to mark another area, the old mark will
van&acirc; <br>
ish. The same effect can be achieved by pressing
Shift-MouseButton1 and dragging out a rectangle in the grid
window. Pressing Shift-MouseButton2 will mark the entire
grid <br>
area.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unmark <br>
This command will cause the marked area to vanish. The same
effect can be achieved by pressing Shift-MouseButton3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Copy <br>
This command is used to copy an area of the grid from one
location to another. If there is no marked grid area
displayed, Copy behaves just like Mark described above. Once
<br>
there is a marked grid area displayed in the highlighting
color, this command has two alternative behaviors. If you
click a mouse button inside the marked area, you will be
<br>
able to drag the rectangle that represents the marked area
to the desired location. After you release the mouse button,
the area will be copied. If you click outside the <br>
marked area, Copy will assume that you wish to mark a
different region of the bitmap image, thus it will behave
like Mark again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Move <br>
This command is used to move an area of the grid from one
location to another. Its behavior resembles the behavior of
Copy command, except that the marked area will be moved <br>
instead of copied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Flip Horizontally <br>
This command will flip the bitmap image with respect to the
horizontal axes. If a marked area of the grid is
highlighted, it will operate only inside the marked area.
<br>
Pressing H inside the bitmap window has the same effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Up This command moves the bitmap
image one pixel up. If a marked area of the grid is
highlighted, it will operate only inside the marked area.
Pressing UpArrow inside the bit&acirc; <br>
map window has the same effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Flip Vertically <br>
This command will flip the bitmap image with respect to the
vertical axes. If a marked area of the grid is highlighted,
it will operate only inside the marked area. Press&acirc;
<br>
ing V inside the bitmap window has the same effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Left <br>
This command moves the bitmap image one pixel to the left.
If a marked area of the grid is highlighted, it will operate
only inside the marked area. Pressing LeftArrow <br>
inside the bitmap window has the same effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fold <br>
This command will fold the bitmap image so that the opposite
corners become adjacent. This is useful when creating bitmap
images for tiling. Pressing F inside the bitmap <br>
window has the same effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Right <br>
This command moves the bitmap image one pixel to the right.
If a marked area of the grid is highlighted, it will operate
only inside the marked area. Pressing RightArrow <br>
inside the bitmap window has the same effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Rotate Left <br>
This command rotates the bitmap image 90 degrees to the left
(counter clockwise.) If a marked area of the grid is
highlighted, it will operate only inside the marked area.
<br>
Pressing L inside the bitmap window has the same effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Down <br>
This command moves the bitmap image one pixel down. If a
marked area of the grid is highlighted, it will operate only
inside the marked area. Pressing DownArrow inside the <br>
bitmap window has the same effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Rotate Right <br>
This command rotates the bitmap image 90 degrees to the
right (clockwise.) If a marked area of the grid is
highlighted, it will operate only inside the marked area.
Press&acirc; <br>
ing R inside the bitmap window has the same effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Point <br>
This command will change the grid squares underneath the
mouse pointer if a mouse button is being pressed down. If
you drag the mouse button continuously, the line may not
<br>
be continuous, depending on the speed of your system and
frequency of mouse motion events.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Curve <br>
This command will change the grid squares underneath the
mouse pointer if a mouse button is being pressed down. If
you drag the mouse button continuously, it will make sure
<br>
that the line is continuous. If your system is slow or
bitmap receives very few mouse motion events, it might
behave quite strangely.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Line <br>
This command will change the gird squares in a line between
two squares. Once you press a mouse button in the grid
window, bitmap will highlight the line from the square <br>
where the mouse button was initially pressed to the square
where the mouse pointer is located. By releasing the mouse
button you will cause the change to take effect, and <br>
the highlighted line will disappear.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Rectangle <br>
This command will change the gird squares in a rectangle
between two squares. Once you press a mouse button in the
grid window, bitmap will highlight the rectangle from the
<br>
square where the mouse button was initially pressed to the
square where the mouse pointer is located. By releasing the
mouse button you will cause the change to take effect, <br>
and the highlighted rectangle will disappear.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Filled Rectangle <br>
This command is identical to Rectangle, except at the end
the rectangle will be filled rather than outlined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Circle <br>
This command will change the gird squares in a circle
between two squares. Once you press a mouse button in the
grid window, bitmap will highlight the circle from the
square <br>
where the mouse button was initially pressed to the square
where the mouse pointer is located. By releasing the mouse
button you will cause the change to take effect, and <br>
the highlighted circle will disappear.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Filled Circle <br>
This command is identical to Circle, except at the end the
circle will be filled rather than outlined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Flood Fill <br>
This command will flood fill the connected area underneath
the mouse pointer when you click on the desired square.
Diagonally adjacent squares are not considered to be
con&acirc; <br>
nected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Set Hot Spot <br>
This command designates one square in the grid as the hot
spot if this bitmap image is to be used for defining a
cursor. Pressing a mouse button in the desired square will
<br>
cause a diamond shape to be displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Clear Hot Spot <br>
This command removes any designated hot spot from the bitmap
image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Undo <br>
This command will undo the last executed command. It has
depth one, that is, pressing Undo after Undo will undo
itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILE MENU <br>
The File menu commands can be accessed by pressing the File
button and selecting the appropriate menu entry, or by
pressing Ctrl key with another key. These commands deal with
<br>
files and global bitmap parameters, such as size, basename,
filename etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">New This command will clear the
editing area and prompt for the name of the new file to be
edited. It will not load in the new file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Load <br>
This command is used to load a new bitmap file into the
bitmap editor. If the current image has not been saved, user
will be asked whether to save or ignore the changes. <br>
The editor can edit only one file at a time. If you need
interactive editing, run a number of editors and use cut and
paste mechanism as described below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Insert <br>
This command is used to insert a bitmap file into the image
being currently edited. After being prompted for the
filename, click inside the grid window and drag the outlined
<br>
rectangle to the location where you want to insert the new
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Save <br>
This command will save the bitmap image. It will not prompt
for the filename unless it is said to be &lt;none&gt;. If
you leave the filename undesignated or -, the output will be
<br>
piped to stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Save As <br>
This command will save the bitmap image after prompting for
a new filename. It should be used if you want to change the
filename.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Resize <br>
This command is used to resize the editing area to the new
number of pixels. The size should be entered in the
WIDTHxHEIGHT format. The information in the image being <br>
edited will not be lost unless the new size is smaller that
the current image size. The editor was not designed to edit
huge files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Rescale <br>
This command is used to rescale the editing area to the new
width and height. The size should be entered in the
WIDTHxHEIGHT format. It will not do antialiasing and
infor&acirc; <br>
mation will be lost if you rescale to the smaller sizes.
Feel free to add you own algorithms for better
rescaling.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Filename <br>
This command is used to change the filename without changing
the basename nor saving the file. If you specify - for a
filename, the output will be piped to stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Basename <br>
This command is used to change the basename, if a different
one from the specified filename is desired.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Quit <br>
This command will terminate the bitmap application. If the
file was not saved, user will be prompted and asked whether
to save the image or not. This command is preferred <br>
over killing the process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EDIT MENU <br>
The Edit menu commands can be accessed by pressing the Edit
button and selecting the appropriate menu entry, or by
pressing Meta key with another key. These commands deal with
<br>
editing facilities such as grid, axes, zooming, cut and
paste, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Image <br>
This command will display the image being edited and its
inverse in its actual size in a separate window. The window
can be moved away to continue with editing. Pressing <br>
the left mouse button in the image window will cause it to
disappear from the screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Grid <br>
This command controls the grid in the editing area. If the
grid spacing is below the value specified by gridTolerance
resource (8 by default), the grid will be automatically <br>
turned off. It can be enforced by explicitly activating this
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Dashed <br>
This command controls the stipple for drawing the grid
lines. The stipple specified by dashes resource can be
turned on or off by activating this command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Axes <br>
This command controls the highlighting of the main axes of
the image being edited. The actual lines are not part of the
image. They are provided to aid user when construct&acirc;
<br>
ing symmetrical images, or whenever having the main axes
highlighted helps your editing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Stippled <br>
This command controls the stippling of the highlighted areas
of the bitmap image. The stipple specified by stipple
resource can be turned on or off by activating this
com&acirc; <br>
mand.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Proportional <br>
This command controls the proportional mode. If the
proportional mode is on, width and height of all image
squares are forced to be equal, regardless of the
proportions of <br>
the bitmap window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Zoom <br>
This command controls the zoom mode. If there is a marked
area of the image already displayed, bitmap will
automatically zoom into it. Otherwise, user will have to
high&acirc; <br>
light an area to be edited in the zoom mode and bitmap will
automatically switch into it. One can use all the editing
commands and other utilities in the zoom mode. When <br>
you zoom out, undo command will undo the whole zoom
session.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cut This commands cuts the
contents of the highlighted image area into the internal cut
and paste buffer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Copy <br>
This command copies the contents of the highlighted image
area into the internal cut and paste buffer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Paste <br>
This command will check if there are any other bitmap
applications with a highlighted image area, or if there is
something in the internal cut and paste buffer and copy it
to <br>
the image. To place the copied image, click in the editing
window and drag the outlined image to the position where you
want to place i, and then release the button.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CUT AND PASTE <br>
Bitmap supports two cut and paste mechanisms; the internal
cut and paste and the global X selection cut and paste. The
internal cut and paste is used when executing copy and <br>
move drawing commands and also cut and copy commands from
the edit menu. The global X selection cut and paste is used
whenever there is a highlighted area of a bitmap image
dis&acirc; <br>
played anywhere on the screen. To copy a part of image from
another bitmap editor simply highlight the desired area by
using the Mark command or pressing the shift key and
drag&acirc; <br>
ging the area with the left mouse button. When the selected
area becomes highlighted, any other applications (such as
xterm, etc.) that use primary selection will discard their
<br>
selection values and unhighlight the appropriate
information. Now, use the Paste command for the Edit menu or
control mouse button to copy the selected part of image into
<br>
another (or the same) bitmap application. If you attempt to
do this without a visible highlighted image area, the bitmap
will fall back to the internal cut and paste buffer and <br>
paste whatever was there stored at the moment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WIDGETS <br>
