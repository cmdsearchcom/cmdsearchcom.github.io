<p>XKILL(1) General Commands Manual XKILL(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
xkill - kill a client by its X resource</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
xkill [-display displayname] [-id resource] [-button number]
[-frame] [-all] [-version]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Xkill is a utility for forcing the X server to close
connections to clients. This program is very dangerous, but
is useful for aborting programs that have displayed
undesired <br>
windows on a user&rsquo;s screen. If no resource identifier
is given with -id, xkill will display a special cursor as a
prompt for the user to select a window to be killed. If a
<br>
pointer button is pressed over a non-root window, the server
will close its connection to the client that created the
window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-display displayname <br>
This option specifies the name of the X server to
contact.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-id resource <br>
This option specifies the X identifier for the resource
whose creator is to be aborted. If no resource is specified,
xkill will display a special cursor with which you <br>
should select a window to be kill.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-button number <br>
This option specifies the number of pointer button that
should be used in selecting a window to kill. If the word
&quot;any&quot; is specified, any button on the pointer may
be <br>
used. By default, the first button in the pointer map (which
is usually the leftmost button) is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-all This option indicates that
all clients with top-level windows on the screen should be
killed. Xkill will ask you to select the root window with
each of the currently <br>
defined buttons to give you several chances to abort. Use of
this option is highly discouraged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-frame This option indicates
that xkill should ignore the standard conventions for
finding top-level client windows (which are typically nested
inside a window manager window), <br>
and simply believe that you want to kill direct children of
the root.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-version <br>
This option makes xkill print its version and exit without
killing anything.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CAVEATS <br>
This command does not provide any warranty that the
application whose connection to the X server is closed will
abort nicely, or even abort at all. All this command does is
to <br>
close the connection to the X server. Many existing
applications do indeed abort when their connection to the X
server is closed, but some can choose to continue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">XDEFAULTS <br>
Button Specifies a specific pointer button number or the
word &quot;any&quot; to use when selecting windows.</p>
