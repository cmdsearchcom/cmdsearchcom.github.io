<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
trend1d - Fit a [weighted] [robust] polynomial [and/or
Fourier] model for y = f(x) to xy[w] data</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
trend1d [ table ] -Fxymrw|p|P|c -Nparams [ xy[w]file ] [
-Ccondition_number ] [ -I[confidence_level] ] [ -V[level] ]
[ -W ] [ -bbinary ] [ -dnodata ] [ -eregexp ] [ -fflags <br>
] [ -hheaders ] [ -iflags ] [ -:[i|o] ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: No space is allowed
between the option flag and the associated arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
trend1d reads x,y [and w] values from the first two [three]
columns on standard input [or file] and fits a regression
model y = f(x) + e by [weighted] least squares. The
func&acirc; <br>
tional form of f(x) may be chosen as polynomial or Fourier
or a mix of the two, and the fit may be made robust by
iterative reweighting of the data. The user may also search
for <br>
the number of terms in f(x) which significantly reduce the
variance in y.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REQUIRED ARGUMENTS <br>
-Fxymrw|p|P|c <br>
Specify up to five letters from the set {x y m r w} in any
order to create columns of ASCII [or binary] output. x = x,
y = y, m = model f(x), r = residual y - m, w = <br>
weight used in fitting. Alternatively, choose just the
single selection p to output a record with the polynomial
model coefficients, P for the normalized polynomial model
<br>
coefficients, or c for the normalized Chebyshev model
coefficients.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N[p|P|f|F|c|C|s|S|x]n[,&acirc;&brvbar;][+llength][+oorigin][+r]
<br>
Specify the components of the (possibly mixed) model. Append
one or more comma-separated model components. Each component
is of the form Tn, where T indicates the basis <br>
function and n indicates the polynomial degree or how many
terms in the Fourier series we want to include. Choose T
from p (polynomial with intercept and powers of x up <br>
to degree n), P (just the single term x^n), f (Fourier
series with n terms), c (Cosine series with n terms), s
(sine series with n terms), F (single Fourier component of
<br>
order n), C (single cosine component of order n), and S
(single sine component of order n). By default the x-origin
and fundamental period is set to the mid-point and <br>
data range, respectively. Change this using the +oorigin and
+llength modifiers. We normalize x before evaluating the
basis functions. Basically, the trigonometric <br>
bases all use the normalized x&acirc; =
(2*pi*(x-origin)/length) while the polynomials use x&acirc;
= 2*(x-x_mid)/(xmax - xmin) for stability. Finally, append
+r for a robust solution <br>
[Default gives a least squares fit]. Use -V to see a
plain-text representation of the y(x) model specified in
-N.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS <br>
table One or more ASCII [or binary, see -bi] files
containing x,y [w] values in the first 2 [3] columns. If no
files are specified, trend1d will read from standard
input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Ccondition_number <br>
Set the maximum allowed condition number for the matrix
solution. trend1d fits a damped least squares model,
retaining only that part of the eigenvalue spectrum such
that <br>
the ratio of the largest eigenvalue to the smallest
eigenvalue is condition_#. [Default: condition_# = 1.0e06.
].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I[confidence_level] <br>
Iteratively increase the number of model parameters,
starting at one, until n_model is reached or the reduction
in variance of the model is not significant at the
confi&acirc; <br>
dence_level level. You may set -I only, without an attached
number; in this case the fit will be iterative with a
default confidence level of 0.51. Or choose your own <br>
level between 0 and 1. See remarks section. Note that the
model terms are added in the order they were given in -N so
you should place the most important terms first.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V[level] (more &acirc;&brvbar;)
<br>
Select verbosity level [c].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-W Weights are supplied in input
column 3. Do a weighted least squares fit [or start with
these weights when doing the iterative robust fit]. [Default
reads only the first 2 <br>
columns.]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-bi[ncols][t] (more
&acirc;&brvbar;) <br>
Select native binary input. [Default is 2 (or 3 if -W is
set) columns].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-bo[ncols][type] (more
&acirc;&brvbar;) <br>
Select native binary output. [Default is 1-5 columns as
given by -F].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d[i|o]nodata (more
&acirc;&brvbar;) <br>
Replace input columns that equal nodata with NaN and do the
reverse on output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e[~]&acirc;pattern&acirc; |
-e[~]/regexp/[i] (more &acirc;&brvbar;) <br>
Only accept data records that match the given pattern.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f[i|o]colinfo (more
&acirc;&brvbar;) <br>
Specify data types of input and/or output columns.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h[i|o][n][+c][+d][+rremark][+rtitle]
(more &acirc;&brvbar;) <br>
Skip or produce header record(s).</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-icols[+l][+sscale][+ooffset][,&acirc;&brvbar;]
(more &acirc;&brvbar;) <br>
Select input columns and transformations (0 is first
column).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-:[i|o] (more &acirc;&brvbar;)
<br>
Swap 1st and 2nd column on input and/or output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-^ or just - <br>
Print a short message about the syntax of the command, then
exits (NOTE: on Windows just use -).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-+ or just + <br>
Print an extensive usage (help) message, including the
explanation of any module-specific option (but not the GMT
common options), then exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-? or no arguments <br>
Print a complete usage (help) message, including the
explanation of all options, then exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ASCII FORMAT PRECISION <br>
The ASCII output formats of numerical data are controlled by
parameters in your gmt.conf file. Longitude and latitude are
formatted according to FORMAT_GEO_OUT, absolute time is <br>
under the control of FORMAT_DATE_OUT and FORMAT_CLOCK_OUT,
whereas general floating point values are formatted
according to FORMAT_FLOAT_OUT. Be aware that the format in
effect <br>
can lead to loss of precision in ASCII output, which can
lead to various problems downstream. If you find the output
is not written with enough precision, consider switching to
<br>
binary output (-bo if available) or specify more decimals
using the FORMAT_FLOAT_OUT setting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REMARKS <br>
If a polynomial model is included, then the domain of x will
be shifted and scaled to [-1, 1] and the basis functions
will be Chebyshev polynomials provided the polygon is of
<br>
full order (otherwise we stay with powers of x). The
Chebyshev polynomials have a numerical advantage in the form
of the matrix which must be inverted and allow more accurate
<br>
solutions. The Chebyshev polynomial of degree n has n+1
extrema in [-1, 1], at all of which its value is either -1
or +1. Therefore the magnitude of the polynomial model
coeffi&acirc; <br>
cients can be directly compared. NOTE: The stable model
coefficients are Chebyshev coefficients. The corresponding
polynomial coefficients in a + bx + cxx + &acirc;&brvbar;
are also given in <br>
Verbose mode but users must realize that they are NOT stable
beyond degree 7 or 8. See Numerical Recipes for more
discussion. For evaluating Chebyshev polynomials, see
gmtmath.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -N&acirc;&brvbar;+r (robust)
and -I (iterative) options evaluate the significance of the
improvement in model misfit Chi-Squared by an F test. The
default confidence limit is set at 0.51; <br>
it can be changed with the -I option. The user may be
surprised to find that in most cases the reduction in
variance achieved by increasing the number of terms in a
model is not <br>
significant at a very high degree of confidence. For
example, with 120 degrees of freedom, Chi-Squared must
decrease by 26% or more to be significant at the 95%
confidence <br>
level. If you want to keep iterating as long as Chi-Squared
is decreasing, set confidence_level to zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A low confidence limit (such as
the default value of 0.51) is needed to make the robust
method work. This method iteratively reweights the data to
reduce the influence of out&acirc; <br>
liers. The weight is based on the Median Absolute Deviation
and a formula from Huber [1964], and is 95% efficient when
the model residuals have an outlier-free normal
distribu&acirc; <br>
tion. This means that the influence of outliers is reduced
only slightly at each iteration; consequently the reduction
in Chi-Squared is not very significant. If the procedure
<br>
needs a few iterations to successfully attenuate their
effect, the significance level of the F test must be kept
low.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
To remove a linear trend from data.xy by ordinary least
squares, use:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gmt trend1d data.xy -Fxr -Np1
&gt; detrended_data.xy</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To make the above linear trend
robust with respect to outliers, use:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gmt trend1d data.xy -Fxr -Np1+r
&gt; detrended_data.xy</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To fit the model y(x) = a + bx^2
+ c * cos(2*pi*3*(x/l) + d * sin(2*pi*3*(x/l), with l the
fundamental period (here l = 15), try:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gmt trend1d data.xy -Fxm
-NP0,P2,F3+l15 &gt; model.xy</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To find out how many terms (up
to 20, say in a robust Fourier interpolant are significant
in fitting data.xy, use:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gmt trend1d data.xy -Nf20+r -I
-V</p>
