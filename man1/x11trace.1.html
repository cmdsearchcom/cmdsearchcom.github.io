<p>X11TRACE(1) X11TRACE X11TRACE(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
x11trace - trace communication between X11 client and
server</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
x11trace [ options ] [ -s | -k ] [ [ -W ] [ -- ] command
args ... ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
x11trace fakes an X server and forwards all connections to a
real X server, displaying the communication between clients
in (well, theoretically) human readable form. If a
com&acirc; <br>
mand is given, x11trace executes the named command with
$DISPLAY set to the faked X server. If that command exits
before any connections are made, x11trace exits immediately
<br>
unless -W is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-I directory <br>
Look into directory for protocol description files. (i.e.
the directory where the .proto files can be found).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s | --stopwhendone (default)
<br>
Terminate when all forwarded clients have disconnected. (Or
when a program was run once the program has finished and all
connections are closed).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k | --keeprunning <br>
If all clients disconnected, wait for new ones to
connect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-W | --waitforclient <br>
Do not stop when the started program terminates before any
connection was made. (Might be necessary if the program
forks to background).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d name | --display name <br>
Forward connections to the X server specified by name
instead of the one specified by the environment variable
DISPLAY.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D name | --fakedisplay name
<br>
Fake display name instead of $FAKEDISPLAY or :9
respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f filename | --authfile
filename <br>
Add an -f filename to the arguments for all calls to xauth
to get the authentication tokens of the X server to connect
to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F filename | --newauthfile
filename <br>
Add an -f filename to the arguments for all calls to xauth
to save the authentication tokens to connect to the faked X
server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c | --copyauthentication
(default) <br>
Copy the authentication tokens for the X server to connect
to so that clients connecting to our fake server will use
them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The commands run are roughly
equivalent to: xauth add $FAKEDISPLAY . &lsquo;xauth list
$DISPLAY | awk &rsquo;$2==&quot;MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1&quot;
{print $3}&rsquo;&lsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Not that only MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1
tokens are copied as x11trace does not yet support to change
the authentication tokens so that XDM-AUTHORIZATION-1 would
be possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n | --nocopyauthentication <br>
Do not call xauth and do fiddle with authentication tokens
but leave that to the user to handle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e | --denyextensions <br>
Modify all server replies to say there are no extensions
available. (As x11trace does supports only a small number of
extensions anyway and calls all extended requests <br>
&quot;unknown&quot; and all replies to such requests
&quot;unexpected&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w | --readwritedebug <br>
Print how many bytes are read and/or written when.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m count | --maxklistlength
count <br>
Print only the first count many elements of all lists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i | --interactive <br>
Only sent requests from the client to the server after
interactive confirmation. Confirmation is given by pressing
enter or a number followed by enter via stdin. This <br>
can give funny results when multiple clients are
tunneled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o | --outfile filename <br>
Dump output into filename instead of stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b | --buffered <br>
Do not write every line on its own but wait until buffers
are full. Speeds up things a little bit when outputting to a
file. Not very useful at all together with -i.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--timestamps <br>
Print a timestamp before each line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the time a packet is
printed is between the time a packet is received and the
time a packet is sent, but it gives no other information
than that.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--relative-timestamps <br>
Print a timestamp relative to the beginning of the
connection before each line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the time a packet is
printed is between the time a packet is received and the
time a packet is sent, but it gives no other information
than that.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--monotonic-timestamps <br>
Print a CLOCK_MONOTONIC (see clock_gettime(3)) timestamp
each time a package is printed. This is likely to be the
uptime of your system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the time a packet is
printed is between the time a packet is received and the
time a packet is sent, but it gives no other information
than that.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--print-offsets <br>
Print offsets of all fields (useful to debug nested lists in
protocol descriptions)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--print-counts <br>
Print counts (useful to debug lists in protocol
descriptions)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
DISPLAY <br>
Without --display the content of this variable is used to
determine the server to connect to. (And without -n given to
xauth to get the authentication tokens for this dis&acirc;
<br>
play.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FAKEDISPLAY <br>
Without --fakedisplay the content of this variable is used
to determine how to listen for clients. (And without -n
given to xauth to set the authentication tokens for this
<br>
display.) If neither is given, x11trace will try :9</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">XAUTHORITY <br>
Without -n and without -f or -F your xauth program will most
likely look into this variable for the file to get/save the
authentication tokens from/into. If this is not <br>
set it will most likely use $HOME/.Xauthority.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REPORTING BUGS <br>
Report bugs to &lt;brlink@debian.org&gt; or the Debian
BTS.</p>
