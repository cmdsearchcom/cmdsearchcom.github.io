<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
makemime - Create MIME-formatted messages</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
makemime [options...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">makemime [@filename]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
makemime creates MIME-formatted messages of arbitrary
complexity. makemime reads one or more individual files,
MIME-encodes them, adds basic MIME headers, and adds any
<br>
additional headers specified bye command line options. The
result is saved to another file or standard output. Complex
MIME-formatted messages are created by piping together <br>
multiple instances of makemime. Advanced options direct
makemime to fork() itself, and handle the details of setting
up all the pipelines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In most cases, options for
makemime come directly from the command line. @filename
reads the options from a file. &quot;@&amp;n&quot; reads
options from a pipe on file descriptor #n. &quot;@-&quot; is
a <br>
shortcut for &quot;@&amp;0&quot;, which reads options from
standard input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When options are read from a
file or a pipe, each option must be on a line by itself. If
an option requires an argument, the argument must follow on
the next line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For readability, leading
whitespace is deleted when options are read from a file or a
pipe. Empty lines are also ignored, as well as lines that
begin with the &rsquo;#&rsquo; character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options and their arguments may
contain characters that are special characters to the shell,
such as &rsquo;(&rsquo; and &rsquo;)&rsquo;. These
characters must be backslashed when specified on the <br>
command line, to avoid their special meaning to the shell.
These characters MUST NOT be backslashed when options are
read from a file or a pipe. Similarly, the contents of most
<br>
headers nearly always include spaces. Therefore they must be
quoted when specified on the command line. Header contents
MUST NOT be quoted when options come from a file or a <br>
pipe.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">makemime reads the content to be
formatted as a MIME message from some other file. The files
can also be a pipe. It is possible to supply both the
options and a file from the <br>
same pipe, by terminating the options list with a line
containing the single character &quot;-&quot;. The remainder
of the pipe will be available to be used as an input file
(which must be <br>
explicitly specified by one of the options). Of course, only
one input file can come from a single pipe.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MIME overview <br>
A MIME-formatted message contains one or several MIME
sections. MIME headers specify how multiple MIME sections
are to be interpreted as a whole (whether they are attached
<br>
together; whether they are alternative representations of
the same content; or something even more esoteric). This
manual page gives a very brief, terse, overview of basic
MIME <br>
concepts. The description is biased towards describing the
functionality of the makemime utility. See RFC 2045[1], RFC
2046[2], RFC 2047[3], RFC 2048[4], and RFC 2049[4] for a
<br>
formal definition of MIME-formatted messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each file in a MIME message is
encoded as a single MIME section. A MIME section consists of
at least one header line, &quot;Content-Type:&quot;. The
&quot;Content-Type:&quot; header gives the type <br>
of the data ontained in the file. Other header lines may
also be present. Their relative order does not matter. MIME
headers are followed by a blank line, then the contents of
<br>
the file, encoded appropriately. All MIME sections generated
by makemime will always contain another header,
&quot;Content-Transfer-Encoding:&quot;. This header gives
the encoding method <br>
used for the file; it is an optional header, but makemime
always creates it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The MIME encoding method
defaults to &quot;7bit&quot; if this header is absent. 7bit
encoding is only suitable for plain text messages in the
US-ASCII character set. The &quot;8bit&quot; encoding <br>
method is used by plain text messages in other character
sets that use octets with the high bit set. An alternative
to 8bit encoding is &quot;quoted-printable&quot;. The
&quot;base64&quot; encoding <br>
method is used for files containing binary data (anything
other than plain text).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MIME sections that contain text
messages have their &quot;Content-Type:&quot; header set to
&quot;text/plain&quot;; or &quot;text/html&quot; for HTML
messages. There are also several other, rare, content <br>
types that can be used. MIME sections that contain other
kinds of data will use some other, appropriate
&quot;Content-Type:&quot; header, such as
&quot;image/gif&quot;, or &quot;audio/x-wav&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MIME sections that contain
textual content may also use the base64 encoding method,
they are not required to use 7bit, 8bit, or
quoted-printable. &quot;text/pdf&quot; sections, that <br>
contain PDF files, typically contain binary data and must
use the base64 encoding. Consequently, MIME sections that
typically contain binary data, such as image/gif and <br>
audio/x-wav, are free to use encodings other than base64, as
long as all the data can be represented by printable
characters (but, in practice, that never happens).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MIME sections may also contain
other, optional, headers such as
&quot;Content-Disposition:&quot;, &quot;Content-ID:&quot;,
and &quot;Content-Name:&quot;. Consult the appropriate RFCs
for the specific usage of <br>
these headers. These headers can be added by makemime by
using the -a option, as described below. These headers play
no part in creating the overall structure of a MIME-encoded
<br>
message, and makemime does not care much about these
headers. It simply includes them, and their content, upon
request.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Multiple files are formatted as
a single message MIME message in two steps: first, by
creating a MIME section for each file; and then creating a
single MIME section that contains <br>
other MIME sections. A &quot;multipart/mixed&quot; MIME
section contains a collection of MIME sections that
represent different objects, attached together. A
&quot;multipart/alternative&quot; MIME <br>
section contains a collection of MIME sections which are
alternative representations of the same object, such as an
HTML and a plain text version of the same message. Other
<br>
&quot;multipart&quot; MIME sections also exist, and their
usage is defined by their respective RFCs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Creating a single MIME section
<br>
makemime {-c &quot;type&quot;} [-e &quot;encoding&quot;] [-o
outputfile] [-C &quot;charset&quot;] [-N &quot;name&quot;]
[-a &quot;header: value&quot;...] {filename}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -c option reads filename,
encodes it appropriately, adds the &quot;Content-Type:
type&quot; and &quot;Content-Transfer-Encoding:&quot; MIME
headers, then writes the result to standard output. <br>
type can be any valid MIME type, except for multipart.
Setting filename to &quot;-&quot; reads from standard input.
Setting filename to &quot;&amp;n&quot; reads from file
descriptor #n.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -C option sets the MIME
charset attribute for text/plain content. The -N option sets
the name attribute for Content-Type:.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">encoding argument should be
specified. It&rsquo;s more efficient to do so. encoding must
be one of the following: 7bit, 8bit, quoted-printable, or
base64.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If encoding is not specified,
makemime reads the filename twice - once to figure out the
best encoding method, and the second time to encode
filename. If filename is a pipe <br>
makemime creates a temporary file, which is not very
efficient if filename is large. However letting makemime
pick the encoding method is more convenient if filename is
<br>
relatively small.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another possibility is to omit
encoding and set type to auto. This combination sets
&quot;Content-Type:&quot; to either text/plain, or
application/octet-stream, based on the selected <br>
encoding.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default the encoded MIME
section is written to standard output. The -o option writes
the MIME section to outputfile. outputfile may be
&quot;&amp;n&quot;, which writes the MIME section to <br>
a pipe on file descriptor #n.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">makemime does not generate any
other headers. Particularly, the &quot;Mime-Version:&quot;
header is required for MIME-formatted E-mail messages.
Additional headers are specified by the -a <br>
option, which may be used multiple times to insert multiple
headers. makemime doesn&rsquo;t do anything with them except
to insert the headers into the generated MIME section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that
&quot;Mime-Version:&quot; is only required for the top level
MIME section. This header is not required for individual
MIME sections that are later combined into a multipart MIME
<br>
collection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note <br>
The -c option must occur listed first, the remaining options
must follow the -c option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Creating a multipart MIME
collection <br>
makemime {-m &quot;multipart/type&quot;} [-e
&quot;encoding&quot;] [-o outputfile] [-a &quot;header:
value&quot;...] {filename}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -m option is identical to
the -c option, except for three differences.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">type must be either
&quot;multipart/mixed&quot;,
&quot;multipart/alternative&quot;, or some other MIME
multipart content type. Additionally, &quot;encoding&quot;
can only be &quot;7bit&quot; or &quot;8bit&quot;, and will
default <br>
to &quot;8bit&quot; if not specified. Finally, filename must
be a MIME-formatted section, NOT a regular file. Usually
filename is created by a previous invocation of makemime (it
can also <br>
be a pipe, like the -c option), but it can be created via
any other means.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -m option creates an initial
multipart MIME collection, that contains only one MIME
section, taken from filename. The collection is written to
standard output, or the pipe or <br>
to outputfile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Creating a multipart MIME
section <br>
makemime {-j file1&quot;} [-o outputfile] {file2}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option adds a MIME section
to an existing MIME collection. file1 must be a MIME
collection that was previously created by the -m option.
file2 must be a MIME section that <br>
was previously created by the -c option. The -j options adds
the MIME section in file2 to the MIME collection in file1.
The result is written to standard output or to
outputfile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file1 and/or file2 may be
&quot;@&amp;n&quot; which reads from file descriptor #n. The
outputfile may also specify a file descriptor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file1 and file2 should ideally
be created by makemime as well. It&rsquo;s also possible to
use MIME-formatted files created by other software, but with
some degree of care. makemime <br>
is not intended to be a MIME parser, but a MIME generator.
However some amount of MIME parsing is necessary to append a
MIME section to an existing MIME collection.
makemime&rsquo;s <br>
parsing is sufficient for appending a new section to a MIME
collection, as long as the MIME headers in the MIME
collections are straightforward. Very convoluted MIME
headers may <br>
confuse makemime, and it may not be able to handle them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Recursive MIME collections <br>
MIME collection may contain other MIME collections as well
as MIME sections. The -m and the -j options may use a
multipart MIME collection in place of a MIME section <br>
automatically because a multipart MIME collection is just a
special type of a MIME section. The following example
encodes a text message that can be alternatively represented
as <br>
HTML or plain text, with some additional attachments:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. Create a MIME collection that
has a text/plain and a text/html MIME section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Create a MIME collection
consisting of the MIME section generated in step one, plus
additional MIME sections containing other attachments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Take two files containing the
text and the html version of a message, and <br>
# add MIME headers to them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">makemime -c &quot;text/plain;
charset=iso-8859-1&quot; -o tmp1.txt msg.txt <br>
makemime -c &quot;text/html; charset=iso-8859-1&quot; -o
tmp1.html msg.html</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Combine the result into a
multipart/alternative collection</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">makemime -m
&quot;multipart/alternative&quot; -a
&quot;Content-Disposition: inline&quot; -o tmp.ma1 tmp1.txt
<br>
makemime -j tmp.ma1 -o tmp.ma2 tmp1.html</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Add MIME headers to an image
attachment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">makemime -c
&quot;image/gif&quot; -a &quot;Content-Disposition:
attachment&quot; -o tmp2.gif attachment.gif</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Create the final
multipart/mixed collection</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">makemime -m
&quot;multipart/mixed&quot; -a &quot;Mime-Version: 1.0&quot;
-o tmp.mm1 tmp.ma2 <br>
makemime -j tmp.mm1 -o output.msg tmp2.gif</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">output.msg now contains the
complete MIME collection. Just add the Subject:, From:, and
To: headers (can also be done by additional -a options, of
course), and send it on its <br>
way.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Building complex MIME encodings
<br>
There are several different ways to build complete MIME
encodings from multiple MIME sections. One way is to use
temporary files to create MIME sections, then combine them
<br>
together into a single MIME collection. A slightly more
complicated approach involves setting up pipes between
multiple makemime processes, in order to avoid using
temporary <br>
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This can be done manually, by
hand. It is also possible to have makemime do this
automatically. makemime will set up these pipes and run
multiple instances of itself to create a <br>
single MIME collection, with multiple attachments of
complexity limited only by your system&rsquo;s limit on the
maximum number of open files and pipes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any file that&rsquo;s read by
the -c, -m, and -j options ( -o specifies a file to create,
and doesn&rsquo;t count) may be replaced by a single
argument containing a left parenthesis, <br>
additional options, then a single argument containing a
right parenthesis. A single invocation of makemime can only
use one -c, -m, or -j option. However, another -c, -m, or -j
<br>
option may be specified inside the left and the right
parenthesis, and its output is used in place of the file it
replaced. In the previous example the third and the fourth
<br>
invocation of makemime can be replaced with the following
command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">makemime -j -m
&quot;multipart/alternative&quot; -a
&quot;Content-Disposition: inline&quot; tmp1.txt -o tmp.ma2
tmp1.html</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the parenthesis must
be backslashed, to avoid their special meaning to the shell.
An equivalent argument file would have the following
contents:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-j <br>
( <br>
-m <br>
multipart/alternative <br>
-a <br>
Content-Disposition: inline <br>
tmp1.txt <br>
) <br>
-o <br>
tmp.ma2 <br>
tmp1.html</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These constructs can be
arbitrarily nested, and are limited by the amount of
available memory and resources. The entire sequence in the
previous section is equivalent to the <br>
following command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">makemime -j -m
&quot;multipart/mixed&quot; -a &quot;Mime-Version: 1.0&quot;
-j -m &quot;multipart/alternative&quot; -a
&quot;Content-Disposition: inline&quot; -c &quot;text/plain;
charset=iso-8859-1&quot; msg.txt -c &quot;text/html;
charset=iso-8859-1&quot; msg.html -o output.msg -c
&quot;image/gif&quot; -a &quot;Content-Disposition:
attachment&quot; attachment.gif</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An equivalent argument file
would be:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-j <br>
( <br>
-m <br>
multipart/mixed <br>
-a <br>
Mime-Version: 1.0 <br>
( <br>
-j <br>
( <br>
-m <br>
multipart/alternative <br>
-a <br>
Content-Disposition: inline <br>
( <br>
-c <br>
text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1 <br>
msg.txt <br>
) <br>
) <br>
( <br>
-c <br>
text/html; charset=iso-8859-1 <br>
msg.html <br>
) <br>
) <br>
) <br>
-o <br>
output.msg <br>
( <br>
-c <br>
image/gif <br>
-a <br>
Content-Disposition: attachment <br>
attachment.gif <br>
)</p>
