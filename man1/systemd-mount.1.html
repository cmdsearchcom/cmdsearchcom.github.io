<p>SYSTEMD-MOUNT(1) systemd-mount SYSTEMD-MOUNT(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
systemd-mount, systemd-umount - Establish and destroy
transient mount or auto-mount points</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
systemd-mount [OPTIONS...] WHAT [WHERE]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">systemd-mount [OPTIONS...]
--list</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">systemd-umount [OPTIONS...]
WHERE...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
systemd-mount may be used to create and start a transient
.mount or .automount unit of the file system WHAT on the
mount point WHERE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In many ways, systemd-mount is
similar to the lower-level mount(8) command, however instead
of executing the mount operation directly and immediately,
systemd-mount schedules it <br>
through the service manager job queue, so that it may pull
in further dependencies (such as parent mounts, or a file
system checker to execute a priori), and may make use of the
<br>
auto-mounting logic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The command takes either one or
two arguments. If only one argument is specified it should
refer to a block device containing a file system (e.g.
&quot;/dev/sdb1&quot;), which is then <br>
probed for a label and other metadata, and is mounted to a
directory whose name is generated from the label. In this
mode the block device must exist at the time of invocation
of <br>
the command, so that it may be probed. If the device is
found to be a removable block device (e.g. a USB stick) an
automount point instead of a regular mount point is created
<br>
(i.e. the --automount= option is implied, see below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If two arguments are specified
the first indicates the mount source (the WHAT) and the
second indicates the path to mount it on (the WHERE). In
this mode no probing of the source <br>
is attempted, and a backing device node doesn&rsquo;t have
to exist yet. However, if this mode is combined with
--discover, device node probing for additional metadata is
enabled, and <br>
&acirc; much like in the single-argument case discussed
above &acirc; the specified device has to exist at the time
of invocation of the command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use the --list command to show a
terse table of all local, known block devices with file
systems that may be mounted with this command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">systemd-umount can be used to
unmount a mount or automount point. It is the same as
systemd-mount --unmount.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The following options are understood:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-block <br>
Do not synchronously wait for the requested operation to
finish. If this is not specified, the job will be verified,
enqueued and systemd-mount will wait until the mount or <br>
automount unit&rsquo;s start-up is completed. By passing
this argument, it is only verified and enqueued.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-pager <br>
Do not pipe output into a pager.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-ask-password <br>
Do not query the user for authentication for privileged
operations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--quiet, -q <br>
Suppresses additional informational output while
running.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--discover <br>
Enable probing of the mount source. This switch is implied
if a single argument is specified on the command line. If
passed, additional metadata is read from the device to <br>
enhance the unit to create. For example, a descriptive
string for the transient units is generated from the file
system label and device model. Moreover if a removable block
<br>
device (e.g. USB stick) is detected an automount unit
instead of a regular mount unit is created, with a short
idle time-out, in order to ensure the file-system is placed
in <br>
a clean state quickly after each access.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--type=, -t <br>
Specifies the file system type to mount (e.g.
&quot;vfat&quot;, &quot;ext4&quot;, ...). If omitted (or set
to &quot;auto&quot;) the file system is determined
automatically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--options=, -o <br>
Additional mount options for the mount point.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--fsck= <br>
Takes a boolean argument, defaults to on. Controls whether
to run a file system check immediately before the mount
operation. In the automount case (see --automount= below)
<br>
the check will be run the moment the first access to the
device is made, which might slightly delay the access.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--description= <br>
Provide a description for the mount or automount unit. See
Description= in systemd.unit(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--property=, -p <br>
Sets a unit property for the mount unit that is created.
This takes an assignment in the same format as
systemctl(1)&rsquo;s set-property command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--automount= <br>
Takes a boolean argument. Controls whether to create an
automount point or a regular mount point. If true an
automount point is created that is backed by the actual file
<br>
system at the time of first access. If false a plain mount
point is created that is backed by the actual file system
immediately. Automount points have the benefit that the <br>
file system stays unmounted and hence in clean state until
it is first accessed. In automount mode the
--timeout-idle-sec= switch (see below) may be used to ensure
the mount <br>
point is unmounted automatically after the last access and
an idle period passed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this switch is not specified
it defaults to false. If not specified and --discover is
used (or only a single argument passed, which implies
--discover, see above), and the <br>
file system block device is detected to be removable, it is
set to true, in order to increase the chance that the file
system is in a fully clean state if the device is <br>
unplugged abruptly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A <br>
Equivalent to --automount=yes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--timeout-idle-sec= <br>
Takes a time value that controls the idle timeout in
automount mode. If set to &quot;infinity&quot; (the default)
no automatic unmounts are done. Otherwise the file system
backing the <br>
automount point is detached after the last access and the
idle timeout passed. See systemd.time(7) for details on the
time syntax supported. This option has no effect if only
<br>
a regular mount is established, and automounting is not
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that if --discover is used
(or only a single argument passed, which implies --discover,
see above), and the file system block device is detected to
be removable, <br>
--timeout-idle-sec=1s is implied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--automount-property= <br>
Similar to --property=, but applies additional properties to
the automount unit created, instead of the mount unit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--bind-device= <br>
Takes a boolean argument, defaults to off. This option only
has an effect in automount mode, and controls whether the
automount unit shall be bound to the backing device&rsquo;s
<br>
lifetime. If enabled, the automount point will be removed
automatically when the backing device vanishes. If disabled
the automount point stays around, and subsequent <br>
accesses will block until backing device is replugged. This
option has no effect in case of non-device mounts, such as
network or virtual file system mounts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that if --discover is used
(or only a single argument passed, which implies --discover,
see above), and the file system block device is detected to
be removable, this <br>
option is implied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--list <br>
Instead of establishing a mount or automount point, print a
terse list of block devices containing file systems that may
be mounted with &quot;systemd-mount&quot;, along with useful
<br>
metadata such as labels, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u, --umount <br>
Stop the mount and automount units corresponding to the
specified mount points WHERE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--user <br>
Talk to the service manager of the calling user, rather than
the service manager of the system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--system <br>
Talk to the service manager of the system. This is the
implied default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H, --host= <br>
Execute the operation remotely. Specify a hostname, or a
username and hostname separated by &quot;@&quot;, to connect
to. The hostname may optionally be suffixed by a container
name, <br>
separated by &quot;:&quot;, which connects directly to a
specific container on the specified host. This will use SSH
to talk to the remote machine manager instance. Container
names may <br>
be enumerated with machinectl -H HOST.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M, --machine= <br>
Execute operation on a local container. Specify a container
name to connect to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Print a short help text and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Print a short version string and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
On success, 0 is returned, a non-zero failure code
otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THE UDEV DATABASE <br>
If --discover is used, systemd-mount honors a couple of
additional udev properties of block devices:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYSTEMD_MOUNT_OPTIONS= <br>
The mount options to use, if --options= is not used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYSTEMD_MOUNT_WHERE= <br>
The file system path to place the mount point at, instead of
the automatically generated one.</p>
