<p>MONKEYSPHERE(1) User Commands MONKEYSPHERE(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
monkeysphere - Monkeysphere client user interface</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
monkeysphere subcommand [args]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Monkeysphere is a framework to leverage the OpenPGP web of
trust for OpenSSH and TLS key-based authentication. OpenPGP
keys are tracked via GnuPG, and added to the autho&acirc;
<br>
rized_keys and known_hosts files used by OpenSSH for
connection authentication. Monkeysphere can also be used by
a validation agent to validate TLS connections (e.g.
https).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">monkeysphere is the Monkeysphere
client utility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SUBCOMMANDS <br>
monkeysphere takes various subcommands:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">update-known_hosts [HOST]...
<br>
Update the known_hosts file. For each specified host, gpg
will be queried for a key associated with the host URI (see
HOST IDENTIFICATION in monkeysphere(7)), optionally <br>
querying a keyserver. If an acceptable key is found for the
host (see KEY ACCEPTABILITY in monkeysphere(7)), the key is
added to the user&rsquo;s known_hosts file. If a key is <br>
found but is unacceptable for the host, any matching keys
are removed from the user&rsquo;s known_hosts file. If no
gpg key is found for the host, nothing is done. If no hosts
<br>
are specified, all hosts listed in the known_hosts file will
be processed. This subcommand will exit with a status of 0
if at least one acceptable key was found for a <br>
specified host, 1 if no matching keys were found at all, and
2 if matching keys were found but none were acceptable.
&lsquo;k&rsquo; may be used in place of
&lsquo;update-known_hosts&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">update-authorized_keys <br>
Update the authorized_keys file for the user executing the
command (see MONKEYSPHERE_AUTHORIZED_KEYS in ENVIRONMENT,
below). First all monkeysphere keys are cleared from <br>
the authorized_keys file. Then, for each user ID in the
user&rsquo;s authorized_user_ids file, gpg will be queried
for keys associated with that user ID, optionally querying a
<br>
keyserver. If an acceptable key is found (see KEY
ACCEPTABILITY in monkeysphere(7)), the key is added to the
user&rsquo;s authorized_keys file. If a key is found but is
unac&acirc; <br>
ceptable for the user ID, any matching keys are removed from
the user&rsquo;s authorized_keys file. If no gpg key is
found for the user ID, nothing is done. This subcommand <br>
will exit with a status of 0 if at least one acceptable key
was found for a user ID, 1 if no matching keys were found at
all, and 2 if matching keys were found but none <br>
were acceptable. &lsquo;a&rsquo; may be used in place of
&lsquo;update-authorized_keys&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gen-subkey [KEYID] <br>
Generate an authentication subkey for a private key in your
GnuPG keyring. KEYID is the key ID for the primary key for
which the subkey with &quot;authentication&quot; capability
<br>
will be generated. If no key ID is specified, but only one
key exists in the secret keyring, that key will be used. The
length of the generated key can be specified with <br>
the &lsquo;--length&rsquo; or &lsquo;-l&rsquo; option.
&lsquo;g&rsquo; may be used in place of
&lsquo;gen-subkey&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ssh-proxycommand [--no-connect]
HOST [PORT] <br>
An ssh ProxyCommand that can be used to trigger a
monkeysphere update of the ssh known_hosts file for a host
that is being connected to with ssh. This works by updating
<br>
the known_hosts file for the host first, before an attempted
connection to the host is made. Once the known_hosts file
has been updated, a TCP connection to the host is <br>
made by exec&rsquo;ing netcat(1). Regular ssh communication
is then done over this netcat TCP connection (see
ProxyCommand in ssh_config(5) for more info).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command is meant to be run
as the ssh &quot;ProxyCommand&quot;. This can either be done
by specifying the proxy command on the command line:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ssh -o
ProxyCommand=&quot;monkeysphere ssh-proxycommand %h %p&quot;
...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or by adding the following line
to your ~/.ssh/config script:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ProxyCommand monkeysphere
ssh-proxycommand %h %p</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The script can easily be
incorporated into other ProxyCommand scripts by calling it
with the &quot;--no-connect&quot; option, i.e.:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">monkeysphere ssh-proxycommand
--no-connect $HOST $PORT</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This will run everything except
the final exec of netcat to make the TCP connection to the
host. In this way this command can be added to another proxy
command that does <br>
other stuff, and then makes the connection to the host
itself. For example, in ~/.ssh/config:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ProxyCommand sh -c
&rsquo;monkeysphere ssh-proxycommand --no-connect %h %p ;
ssh -W %h:%p jumphost.example.net&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KEYSERVER CHECKING: The proxy
command has a fairly nuanced policy for when keyservers are
queried when processing a host. If the host userID is not
found in either the <br>
user&rsquo;s keyring or in the known_hosts file, then the
keyserver is queried for the host userID. If the host userID
is found in the user&rsquo;s keyring, then the keyserver is
not <br>
checked. This assumes that the keyring is kept up-to-date,
in a cronjob or the like, so that revocations are properly
handled. If the host userID is not found in the <br>
user&rsquo;s keyring, but the host is listed in the
known_hosts file, then the keyserver is not checked. This
last policy might change in the future, possibly by adding a
<br>
deferred check, so that hosts that go from
non-monkeysphere-enabled to monkeysphere-enabled will be
properly checked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Setting the CHECK_KEYSERVER
variable in the config file or the
MONKEYSPHERE_CHECK_KEYSERVER environment variable to either
&lsquo;true&rsquo; or &lsquo;false&rsquo; will override the
keyserver- <br>
checking policy defined above and either always or never
check the keyserver for host key updates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">subkey-to-ssh-agent [ssh-add
arguments] <br>
Push all authentication-capable subkeys in your GnuPG secret
keyring into your running ssh-agent. Additional arguments
are passed through to ssh-add(1). For example, to <br>
remove the authentication subkeys, pass an additional
&lsquo;-d&rsquo; argument. To require confirmation on each
use of the key, pass &lsquo;-c&rsquo;. The
MONKEYSPHERE_SUBKEYS_FOR_AGENT envi&acirc; <br>
ronment can be used to specify the full fingerprints of
specific keys to add to the agent (space separated), instead
of adding them all. &lsquo;s&rsquo; may be used in place of
&lsquo;sub&acirc; <br>
key-to-ssh-agent&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">keys-for-userid USERID <br>
Output to stdout all acceptable keys for a given user ID.
&lsquo;u&rsquo; may be used in place of
&lsquo;keys-for-userid&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sshfprs-for-userid USERID <br>
Output the ssh fingerprints of acceptable keys for a given
user ID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">version <br>
Show the monkeysphere version number. &lsquo;v&rsquo; may be
used in place of &lsquo;version&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">help Output a brief usage
summary. &lsquo;h&rsquo; or &lsquo;?&rsquo; may be used in
place of &lsquo;help&rsquo;.</p>
