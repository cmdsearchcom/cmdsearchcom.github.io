<p>TOR(1) Tor Manual TOR(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
tor - The second-generation onion router</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
tor [OPTION value]...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Tor is a connection-oriented anonymizing communication
service. Users choose a source-routed path through a set of
nodes, and negotiate a &quot;virtual circuit&quot; through
the network, <br>
in which each node knows its predecessor and successor, but
no others. Traffic flowing down the circuit is unwrapped by
a symmetric key at each node, which reveals the downstream
<br>
node.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Basically, Tor provides a
distributed network of servers or relays (&quot;onion
routers&quot;). Users bounce their TCP streams &acirc; web
traffic, ftp, ssh, etc. &acirc; around the network, and <br>
recipients, observers, and even the relays themselves have
difficulty tracking the source of the stream.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, tor will act as a
client only. To help the network by providing bandwidth as a
relay, change the ORPort configuration option &acirc; see
below. Please also consult the <br>
documentation on the Tor Project&acirc;s website.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS <br>
-h, -help <br>
Display a short help message and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f FILE <br>
Specify a new configuration file to contain further Tor
configuration options OR pass - to make Tor read its
configuration from standard input. (Default: /etc/tor/torrc,
or <br>
$HOME/.torrc if that file is not found)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--allow-missing-torrc <br>
Do not require that configuration file specified by -f exist
if default torrc can be accessed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--defaults-torrc FILE <br>
Specify a file in which to find default values for Tor
options. The contents of this file are overridden by those
in the regular configuration file, and by those on the <br>
command line. (Default: /etc/tor/torrc-defaults.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ignore-missing-torrc <br>
Specifies that Tor should treat a missing torrc file as
though it were empty. Ordinarily, Tor does this for missing
default torrc files, but not for those specified on the <br>
command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--hash-password PASSWORD <br>
Generates a hashed password for control port access.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--list-fingerprint <br>
Generate your keys and output your nickname and
fingerprint.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--verify-config <br>
Verify the configuration file is valid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--service install [--options
command-line options] <br>
Install an instance of Tor as a Windows service, with the
provided command-line options. Current instructions can be
found at https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq#NTService</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--service remove|start|stop <br>
Remove, start, or stop a configured Tor Windows service.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--nt-service <br>
Used internally to implement a Windows service.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--list-torrc-options <br>
List all valid options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--list-deprecated-options <br>
List all valid options that are scheduled to become obsolete
in a future version. (This is a warning, not a promise.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Display Tor version and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--quiet|--hush <br>
Override the default console log. By default, Tor starts out
logging messages at level &quot;notice&quot; and higher to
the console. It stops doing so after it parses its <br>
configuration, if the configuration tells it to log anywhere
else. You can override this behavior with the --hush option,
which tells Tor to only send warnings and errors to <br>
the console, or with the --quiet option, which tells Tor not
to log to the console at all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--keygen [--newpass] <br>
Running &quot;tor --keygen&quot; creates a new ed25519
master identity key for a relay, or only a fresh temporary
signing key and certificate, if you already have a master
key. <br>
Optionally you can encrypt the master identity key with a
passphrase: Tor will ask you for one. If you don&acirc;t
want to encrypt the master key, just don&acirc;t enter any
passphrase <br>
when asked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The --newpass option should be
used with --keygen only when you need to add, change, or
remove a passphrase on an existing ed25519 master identity
key. You will be prompted <br>
for the old passphase (if any), and the new passphrase (if
any).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When generating a master key,
you will probably want to use --DataDirectory to control
where the keys and certificates will be stored, and
--SigningKeyLifetime to control <br>
their lifetimes. Their behavior is as documented in the
server options section below. (You must have write access to
the specified DataDirectory.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To use the generated files, you
must copy them to the DataDirectory/keys directory of your
Tor daemon, and make sure that they are owned by the user
actually running the Tor <br>
daemon on your system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--passphrase-fd FILEDES <br>
Filedescriptor to read the passphrase from. Note that unlike
with the tor-gencert program, the entire file contents are
read and used as the passphrase, including any <br>
trailing newlines. Default: read from the terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other options can be specified
on the command-line in the format &quot;--option
value&quot;, in the format &quot;option value&quot;, or in a
configuration file. For instance, you can tell Tor to <br>
start listening for SOCKS connections on port 9999 by
passing --SocksPort 9999 or SocksPort 9999 to it on the
command line, or by putting &quot;SocksPort 9999&quot; in
the configuration <br>
file. You will need to quote options with spaces in them: if
you want Tor to log all debugging messages to debug.log, you
will probably need to say --Log debug file debug.log.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options on the command line
override those in configuration files. See the next section
for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THE CONFIGURATION FILE FORMAT
<br>
All configuration options in a configuration are written on
a single line by default. They take the form of an option
name and a value, or an option name and a quoted value <br>
(option value or option &quot;value&quot;). Anything after a
# character is treated as a comment. Options are
case-insensitive. C-style escaped characters are allowed
inside quoted values. <br>
To split one configuration entry into multiple lines, use a
single backslash character ( before the end of the line.
Comments can be used in such multiline entries, but they
<br>
must start at the beginning of a line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, an option on the
command line overrides an option found in the configuration
file, and an option in a configuration file overrides one in
the defaults file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This rule is simple for options
that take a single value, but it can become complicated for
options that are allowed to occur more than once: if you
specify four SocksPorts in <br>
your configuration file, and one more SocksPort on the
command line, the option on the command line will replace
all of the SocksPorts in the configuration file. If this
isn&acirc;t <br>
what you want, prefix the option name with a plus sign (+),
and it will be appended to the previous set of options
instead. For example, setting SocksPort 9100 will use only
port <br>
9100, but setting +SocksPort 9100 will use ports 9100 and
9050 (because this is the default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alternatively, you might want to
remove every instance of an option in the configuration
file, and not replace it at all: you might want to say on
the command line that you want <br>
no SocksPorts at all. To do that, prefix the option name
with a forward slash (/). You can use the plus sign (+) and
the forward slash (/) in the configuration file and on the
<br>
command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GENERAL OPTIONS <br>
BandwidthRate N bytes|KBytes|MBytes|GBytes|KBits|MBits|GBits
<br>
A token bucket limits the average incoming bandwidth usage
on this node to the specified number of bytes per second,
and the average outgoing bandwidth usage to that same <br>
value. If you want to run a relay in the public network,
this needs to be at the very least 75 KBytes for a relay
(that is, 600 kbits) or 50 KBytes for a bridge (400 kbits)
&acirc; <br>
but of course, more is better; we recommend at least 250
KBytes (2 mbits) if possible. (Default: 1 GByte)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With this option, and in other
options that take arguments in bytes, KBytes, and so on,
other formats are also supported. Notably,
&quot;KBytes&quot; can also be written as
&quot;kilobytes&quot; <br>
or &quot;kb&quot;; &quot;MBytes&quot; can be written as
&quot;megabytes&quot; or &quot;MB&quot;; &quot;kbits&quot;
can be written as &quot;kilobits&quot;; and so forth. Tor
also accepts &quot;byte&quot; and &quot;bit&quot; in the
singular. The prefixes <br>
&quot;tera&quot; and &quot;T&quot; are also recognized. If
no units are given, we default to bytes. To avoid confusion,
we recommend writing &quot;bytes&quot; or &quot;bits&quot;
explicitly, since it&acirc;s easy to <br>
forget that &quot;B&quot; means bytes, not bits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BandwidthBurst N
bytes|KBytes|MBytes|GBytes|KBits|MBits|GBits <br>
Limit the maximum token bucket size (also known as the
burst) to the given number of bytes in each direction.
(Default: 1 GByte)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MaxAdvertisedBandwidth N
bytes|KBytes|MBytes|GBytes|KBits|MBits|GBits <br>
If set, we will not advertise more than this amount of
bandwidth for our BandwidthRate. Server operators who want
to reduce the number of clients who ask to build circuits
<br>
through them (since this is proportional to advertised
bandwidth rate) can thus reduce the CPU demands on their
server without impacting network performance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RelayBandwidthRate N
bytes|KBytes|MBytes|GBytes|KBits|MBits|GBits <br>
If not 0, a separate token bucket limits the average
incoming bandwidth usage for _relayed traffic_ on this node
to the specified number of bytes per second, and the average
<br>
outgoing bandwidth usage to that same value. Relayed traffic
currently is calculated to include answers to directory
requests, but that may change in future versions. <br>
(Default: 0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RelayBandwidthBurst N
bytes|KBytes|MBytes|GBytes|KBits|MBits|GBits <br>
If not 0, limit the maximum token bucket size (also known as
the burst) for _relayed traffic_ to the given number of
bytes in each direction. (Default: 0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PerConnBWRate N
bytes|KBytes|MBytes|GBytes|KBits|MBits|GBits <br>
If set, do separate rate limiting for each connection from a
non-relay. You should never need to change this value, since
a network-wide value is published in the consensus <br>
and your relay will use that value. (Default: 0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PerConnBWBurst N
bytes|KBytes|MBytes|GBytes|KBits|MBits|GBits <br>
If set, do separate rate limiting for each connection from a
non-relay. You should never need to change this value, since
a network-wide value is published in the consensus <br>
and your relay will use that value. (Default: 0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ClientTransportPlugin transport
socks4|socks5 IP:PORT, ClientTransportPlugin transport exec
path-to-binary [options] <br>
In its first form, when set along with a corresponding
Bridge line, the Tor client forwards its traffic to a
SOCKS-speaking proxy on &quot;IP:PORT&quot;. It&acirc;s the
duty of that proxy to <br>
properly forward the traffic to the bridge.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In its second form, when set
along with a corresponding Bridge line, the Tor client
launches the pluggable transport proxy executable in
path-to-binary using options as its <br>
command-line options, and forwards its traffic to it.
It&acirc;s the duty of that proxy to properly forward the
traffic to the bridge.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ServerTransportPlugin transport
exec path-to-binary [options] <br>
The Tor relay launches the pluggable transport proxy in
path-to-binary using options as its command-line options,
and expects to receive proxied client traffic from it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ServerTransportListenAddr
transport IP:PORT <br>
When this option is set, Tor will suggest IP:PORT as the
listening address of any pluggable transport proxy that
tries to launch transport.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ServerTransportOptions transport
k=v k=v ... <br>
When this option is set, Tor will pass the k=v parameters to
any pluggable transport proxy that tries to launch
transport.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(Example: ServerTransportOptions
obfs45 shared-secret=bridgepasswd
cache=/var/lib/tor/cache)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ExtORPort [address:]port|auto
<br>
Open this port to listen for Extended ORPort connections
from your pluggable transports.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ExtORPortCookieAuthFile Path
<br>
If set, this option overrides the default location and file
name for the Extended ORPort&acirc;s cookie file &acirc; the
cookie file is needed for pluggable transports to
communicate <br>
through the Extended ORPort.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">ExtORPortCookieAuthFileGroupReadable
0|1 <br>
If this option is set to 0, don&acirc;t allow the filesystem
group to read the Extended OR Port cookie file. If the
option is set to 1, make the cookie file readable by the
default <br>
GID. [Making the file readable by other groups is not yet
implemented; let us know if you need this for some reason.]
(Default: 0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ConnLimit NUM <br>
The minimum number of file descriptors that must be
available to the Tor process before it will start. Tor will
ask the OS for as many file descriptors as the OS will allow
<br>
(you can find this by &quot;ulimit -H -n&quot;). If this
number is less than ConnLimit, then Tor will refuse to
start.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You probably don&acirc;t need to
adjust this. It has no effect on Windows since that platform
lacks getrlimit(). (Default: 1000)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DisableNetwork 0|1 <br>
When this option is set, we don&acirc;t listen for or accept
any connections other than controller connections, and we
close (and don&acirc;t reattempt) any outbound connections.
<br>
Controllers sometimes use this option to avoid using the
network until Tor is fully configured. (Default: 0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ConstrainedSockets 0|1 <br>
If set, Tor will tell the kernel to attempt to shrink the
buffers for all sockets to the size specified in
ConstrainedSockSize. This is useful for virtual servers and
other <br>
environments where system level TCP buffers may be limited.
If you&acirc;re on a virtual server, and you encounter the
&quot;Error creating network socket: No buffer space
available&quot; <br>
message, you are likely experiencing this problem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The preferred solution is to
have the admin increase the buffer pool for the host itself
via /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_mem or equivalent facility; this
configuration option is a <br>
second-resort.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The DirPort option should also
not be used if TCP buffers are scarce. The cached directory
requests consume additional sockets which exacerbates the
problem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You should not enable this
feature unless you encounter the &quot;no buffer space
available&quot; issue. Reducing the TCP buffers affects
window size for the TCP stream and will reduce <br>
throughput in proportion to round trip time on long paths.
(Default: 0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ConstrainedSockSize N
bytes|KBytes <br>
When ConstrainedSockets is enabled the receive and transmit
buffers for all sockets will be set to this limit. Must be a
value between 2048 and 262144, in 1024 byte <br>
increments. Default of 8192 is recommended.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ControlPort PORT|unix:path|auto
[flags] <br>
If set, Tor will accept connections on this port and allow
those connections to control the Tor process using the Tor
Control Protocol (described in control-spec.txt in <br>
torspec). Note: unless you also specify one or more of
HashedControlPassword or CookieAuthentication, setting this
option will cause Tor to allow any process on the local <br>
host to control it. (Setting both authentication methods
means either method is sufficient to authenticate to Tor.)
This option is required for many Tor controllers; most use
<br>
the value of 9051. If a unix domain socket is used, you may
quote the path using standard C escape sequences. Set it to
&quot;auto&quot; to have Tor pick a port for you. (Default:
0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Recognized flags are...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GroupWritable <br>
Unix domain sockets only: makes the socket get created as
group-writable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WorldWritable <br>
Unix domain sockets only: makes the socket get created as
world-writable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RelaxDirModeCheck <br>
Unix domain sockets only: Do not insist that the directory
that holds the socket be read-restricted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ControlListenAddress IP[:PORT]
<br>
Bind the controller listener to this address. If you specify
a port, bind to this port rather than the one specified in
ControlPort. We strongly recommend that you leave this <br>
alone unless you know what you&acirc;re doing, since giving
attackers access to your control listener is really
dangerous. This directive can be specified multiple times to
bind to <br>
multiple addresses/ports. (Default: 127.0.0.1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ControlSocket Path <br>
Like ControlPort, but listens on a Unix domain socket,
rather than a TCP socket. 0 disables ControlSocket (Unix and
Unix-like systems only.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ControlSocketsGroupWritable 0|1
<br>
If this option is set to 0, don&acirc;t allow the filesystem
group to read and write unix sockets (e.g. ControlSocket).
If the option is set to 1, make the control socket readable
<br>
and writable by the default GID. (Default: 0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HashedControlPassword
hashed_password <br>
Allow connections on the control port if they present the
password whose one-way hash is hashed_password. You can
compute the hash of a password by running &quot;tor <br>
--hash-password password&quot;. You can provide several
acceptable passwords by using more than one
HashedControlPassword line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CookieAuthentication 0|1 <br>
If this option is set to 1, allow connections on the control
port when the connecting process knows the contents of a
file named &quot;control_auth_cookie&quot;, which Tor will
create <br>
in its data directory. This authentication method should
only be used on systems with good filesystem security.
(Default: 0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CookieAuthFile Path <br>
If set, this option overrides the default location and file
name for Tor&acirc;s cookie file. (See CookieAuthentication
above.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CookieAuthFileGroupReadable 0|1
<br>
If this option is set to 0, don&acirc;t allow the filesystem
group to read the cookie file. If the option is set to 1,
make the cookie file readable by the default GID. [Making
the <br>
file readable by other groups is not yet implemented; let us
know if you need this for some reason.] (Default: 0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ControlPortWriteToFile Path <br>
If set, Tor writes the address and port of any control port
it opens to this address. Usable by controllers to learn the
actual control port when ControlPort is set to <br>
&quot;auto&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ControlPortFileGroupReadable 0|1
<br>
If this option is set to 0, don&acirc;t allow the filesystem
group to read the control port file. If the option is set to
1, make the control port file readable by the default GID.
<br>
(Default: 0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DataDirectory DIR <br>
Store working data in DIR (Default: /var/lib/tor)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DataDirectoryGroupReadable 0|1
<br>
If this option is set to 0, don&acirc;t allow the filesystem
group to read the DataDirectory. If the option is set to 1,
make the DataDirectory readable by the default GID. <br>
(Default: 0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FallbackDir address:port
orport=port id=fingerprint [weight=num]
[ipv6=address:orport] <br>
When we&acirc;re unable to connect to any directory cache
for directory info (usually because we don&acirc;t know
about any yet) we try a directory authority. Clients also
simultaneously <br>
try a FallbackDir, to avoid hangs on client startup if a
directory authority is down. Clients retry FallbackDirs more
often than directory authorities, to reduce the load on <br>
the directory authorities. By default, the directory
authorities are also FallbackDirs. Specifying a FallbackDir
replaces Tor&acirc;s default hard-coded FallbackDirs (if
any). (See <br>
the DirAuthority entry for an explanation of each flag.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UseDefaultFallbackDirs 0|1 <br>
Use Tor&acirc;s default hard-coded FallbackDirs (if any).
(When a FallbackDir line is present, it replaces the
hard-coded FallbackDirs, regardless of the value of <br>
UseDefaultFallbackDirs.) (Default: 1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DirAuthority [nickname] [flags]
address:port fingerprint <br>
Use a nonstandard authoritative directory server at the
provided address and port, with the specified key
fingerprint. This option can be repeated many times, for
multiple <br>
authoritative directory servers. Flags are separated by
spaces, and determine what kind of an authority this
directory is. By default, an authority is not authoritative
for <br>
any directory style or version unless an appropriate flag is
given. Tor will use this authority as a bridge authoritative
directory if the &quot;bridge&quot; flag is set. If a flag
<br>
&quot;orport=port&quot; is given, Tor will use the given
port when opening encrypted tunnels to the dirserver. If a
flag &quot;weight=num&quot; is given, then the directory
server is chosen <br>
randomly with probability proportional to that weight
(default 1.0). If a flag &quot;v3ident=fp&quot; is given,
the dirserver is a v3 directory authority whose v3 long-term
signing key <br>
has the fingerprint fp. Lastly, if an
&quot;ipv6=address:orport&quot; flag is present, then the
directory authority is listening for IPv6 connections on the
indicated IPv6 address and <br>
OR Port.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tor will contact the authority
at address:port (the DirPort) to download directory
documents. If an IPv6 address is supplied, Tor will also
download directory documents at <br>
the IPv6 address on the DirPort.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no DirAuthority line is
given, Tor will use the default directory authorities. NOTE:
this option is intended for setting up a private Tor network
with its own directory <br>
authorities. If you use it, you will be distinguishable from
other users, because you won&acirc;t believe the same
authorities they do.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DirAuthorityFallbackRate NUM
<br>
When configured to use both directory authorities and
fallback directories, the directory authorities also work as
fallbacks. They are chosen with their regular weights, <br>
multiplied by this number, which should be 1.0 or less.
(Default: 1.0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AlternateDirAuthority [nickname]
[flags] address:port fingerprint</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AlternateBridgeAuthority
[nickname] [flags] address:port fingerprint <br>
These options behave as DirAuthority, but they replace fewer
of the default directory authorities. Using
AlternateDirAuthority replaces the default Tor directory
authorities, <br>
but leaves the default bridge authorities in place.
Similarly, AlternateBridgeAuthority replaces the default
bridge authority, but leaves the directory authorities
alone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DisableAllSwap 0|1 <br>
If set to 1, Tor will attempt to lock all current and future
memory pages, so that memory cannot be paged out. Windows,
OS X and Solaris are currently not supported. We <br>
believe that this feature works on modern Gnu/Linux
distributions, and that it should work on *BSD systems
(untested). This option requires that you start your Tor as
root, <br>
and you should use the User option to properly reduce
Tor&acirc;s privileges. (Default: 0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DisableDebuggerAttachment 0|1
<br>
If set to 1, Tor will attempt to prevent basic debugging
attachment attempts by other processes. This may also keep
Tor from generating core files if it crashes. It has no <br>
impact for users who wish to attach if they have
CAP_SYS_PTRACE or if they are root. We believe that this
feature works on modern Gnu/Linux distributions, and that it
may <br>
also work on *BSD systems (untested). Some modern Gnu/Linux
systems such as Ubuntu have the kernel.yama.ptrace_scope
sysctl and by default enable it as an attempt to limit <br>
the PTRACE scope for all user processes by default. This
feature will attempt to limit the PTRACE scope for Tor
specifically - it will not attempt to alter the system wide
<br>
ptrace scope as it may not even exist. If you wish to attach
to Tor with a debugger such as gdb or strace you will want
to set this to 0 for the duration of your debugging. <br>
Normal users should leave it on. Disabling this option while
Tor is running is prohibited. (Default: 1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FetchDirInfoEarly 0|1 <br>
If set to 1, Tor will always fetch directory information
like other directory caches, even if you don&acirc;t meet
the normal criteria for fetching early. Normal users should
leave <br>
it off. (Default: 0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FetchDirInfoExtraEarly 0|1 <br>
If set to 1, Tor will fetch directory information before
other directory caches. It will attempt to download
directory information closer to the start of the consensus
<br>
period. Normal users should leave it off. (Default: 0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FetchHidServDescriptors 0|1 <br>
If set to 0, Tor will never fetch any hidden service
descriptors from the rendezvous directories. This option is
only useful if you&acirc;re using a Tor controller that
handles <br>
hidden service fetches for you. (Default: 1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FetchServerDescriptors 0|1 <br>
If set to 0, Tor will never fetch any network status
summaries or server descriptors from the directory servers.
This option is only useful if you&acirc;re using a Tor
controller <br>
that handles directory fetches for you. (Default: 1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FetchUselessDescriptors 0|1 <br>
If set to 1, Tor will fetch every non-obsolete descriptor
from the authorities that it hears about. Otherwise, it will
avoid fetching useless descriptors, for example for <br>
routers that are not running. This option is useful if
you&acirc;re using the contributed &quot;exitlist&quot;
script to enumerate Tor nodes that exit to certain
addresses. (Default: 0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HTTPProxy host[:port] <br>
Tor will make all its directory requests through this
host:port (or host:80 if port is not specified), rather than
connecting directly to any directory servers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HTTPProxyAuthenticator
username:password <br>
If defined, Tor will use this username:password for Basic
HTTP proxy authentication, as in RFC 2617. This is currently
the only form of HTTP proxy authentication that Tor <br>
supports; feel free to submit a patch if you want it to
support others.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HTTPSProxy host[:port] <br>
Tor will make all its OR (SSL) connections through this
host:port (or host:443 if port is not specified), via HTTP
CONNECT rather than connecting directly to servers. You may
<br>
want to set FascistFirewall to restrict the set of ports you
might try to connect to, if your HTTPS proxy only allows
connecting to certain ports.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HTTPSProxyAuthenticator
username:password <br>
If defined, Tor will use this username:password for Basic
HTTPS proxy authentication, as in RFC 2617. This is
currently the only form of HTTPS proxy authentication that
Tor <br>
supports; feel free to submit a patch if you want it to
support others.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sandbox 0|1 <br>
If set to 1, Tor will run securely through the use of a
syscall sandbox. Otherwise the sandbox will be disabled. The
option is currently an experimental feature. (Default:
0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Socks4Proxy host[:port] <br>
Tor will make all OR connections through the SOCKS 4 proxy
at host:port (or host:1080 if port is not specified).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Socks5Proxy host[:port] <br>
Tor will make all OR connections through the SOCKS 5 proxy
at host:port (or host:1080 if port is not specified).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Socks5ProxyUsername username</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Socks5ProxyPassword password
<br>
If defined, authenticate to the SOCKS 5 server using
username and password in accordance to RFC 1929. Both
username and password must be between 1 and 255
characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SocksSocketsGroupWritable 0|1
<br>
If this option is set to 0, don&acirc;t allow the filesystem
group to read and write unix sockets (e.g. SocksSocket). If
the option is set to 1, make the SocksSocket socket <br>
readable and writable by the default GID. (Default: 0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KeepalivePeriod NUM <br>
To keep firewalls from expiring connections, send a padding
keepalive cell every NUM seconds on open connections that
are in use. If the connection has no open circuits, it <br>
will instead be closed after NUM seconds of idleness.
(Default: 5 minutes)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Log minSeverity[-maxSeverity]
stderr|stdout|syslog <br>
Send all messages between minSeverity and maxSeverity to the
standard output stream, the standard error stream, or to the
system log. (The &quot;syslog&quot; value is only supported
on <br>
Unix.) Recognized severity levels are debug, info, notice,
warn, and err. We advise using &quot;notice&quot; in most
cases, since anything more verbose may provide sensitive
<br>
information to an attacker who obtains the logs. If only one
severity level is given, all messages of that level or
higher will be sent to the listed destination.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Log minSeverity[-maxSeverity]
file FILENAME <br>
As above, but send log messages to the listed filename. The
&quot;Log&quot; option may appear more than once in a
configuration file. Messages are sent to all the logs that
match their <br>
severity level.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Log
[domain,...]minSeverity[-maxSeverity] ... file FILENAME</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Log
[domain,...]minSeverity[-maxSeverity] ...
stderr|stdout|syslog <br>
As above, but select messages by range of log severity and
by a set of &quot;logging domains&quot;. Each logging domain
corresponds to an area of functionality inside Tor. You can
<br>
specify any number of severity ranges for a single log
statement, each of them prefixed by a comma-separated list
of logging domains. You can prefix a domain with ~ to <br>
indicate negation, and use * to indicate &quot;all
domains&quot;. If you specify a severity range without a
list of domains, it matches all domains.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is an advanced feature
which is most useful for debugging one or two of Tor&acirc;s
subsystems at a time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The currently recognized domains
are: general, crypto, net, config, fs, protocol, mm, http,
app, control, circ, rend, bug, dir, dirserv, or, edge, acct,
hist, and handshake. <br>
Domain names are case-insensitive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, &quot;Log
[handshake]debug [~net,~mm]info notice stdout&quot; sends to
stdout: all handshake messages of any severity, all
info-and-higher messages from domains other than <br>
networking and memory management, and all messages of
severity notice or higher.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LogMessageDomains 0|1 <br>
If 1, Tor includes message domains with each log message.
Every log message currently has at least one domain; most
currently have exactly one. This doesn&acirc;t affect
controller <br>
log messages. (Default: 0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MaxUnparseableDescSizeToLog N
bytes|KBytes|MBytes|GBytes <br>
Unparseable descriptors (e.g. for votes, consensuses,
routers) are logged in separate files by hash, up to the
specified size in total. Note that only files logged during
the <br>
lifetime of this Tor process count toward the total; this is
intended to be used to debug problems without opening live
servers to resource exhaustion attacks. (Default: 10 <br>
MB)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OutboundBindAddress IP <br>
Make all outbound connections originate from the IP address
specified. This is only useful when you have multiple
network interfaces, and you want all of Tor&acirc;s outgoing
<br>
connections to use a single one. This option may be used
twice, once with an IPv4 address and once with an IPv6
address. This setting will be ignored for connections to the
<br>
loopback addresses (127.0.0.0/8 and ::1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PidFile FILE <br>
On startup, write our PID to FILE. On clean shutdown, remove
FILE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ProtocolWarnings 0|1 <br>
If 1, Tor will log with severity &rsquo;warn&rsquo; various
cases of other parties not following the Tor specification.
Otherwise, they are logged with severity &rsquo;info&rsquo;.
(Default: 0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PredictedPortsRelevanceTime NUM
<br>
Set how long, after the client has made an anonymized
connection to a given port, we will try to make sure that we
build circuits to exits that support that port. The maximum
<br>
value for this option is 1 hour. (Default: 1 hour)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RunAsDaemon 0|1 <br>
If 1, Tor forks and daemonizes to the background. This
option has no effect on Windows; instead you should use the
--service command-line option. (Default: 0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LogTimeGranularity NUM <br>
Set the resolution of timestamps in Tor&acirc;s logs to NUM
milliseconds. NUM must be positive and either a divisor or a
multiple of 1 second. Note that this option only controls
<br>
the granularity written by Tor to a file or console log. Tor
does not (for example) &quot;batch up&quot; log messages to
affect times logged by a controller, times attached to
syslog <br>
messages, or the mtime fields on log files. (Default: 1
second)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TruncateLogFile 0|1 <br>
If 1, Tor will overwrite logs at startup and in response to
a HUP signal, instead of appending to them. (Default: 0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SyslogIdentityTag tag <br>
When logging to syslog, adds a tag to the syslog identity
such that log entries are marked with &quot;Tor-tag&quot;.
(Default: none)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SafeLogging 0|1|relay <br>
Tor can scrub potentially sensitive strings from log
messages (e.g. addresses) by replacing them with the string
[scrubbed]. This way logs can still be useful, but they
don&acirc;t <br>
leave behind personally identifying information about what
sites a user might have visited.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option is set to 0, Tor
will not perform any scrubbing, if it is set to 1, all
potentially sensitive strings are replaced. If it is set to
relay, all log messages <br>
generated when acting as a relay are sanitized, but all
messages generated when acting as a client are not.
(Default: 1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">User Username <br>
On startup, setuid to this user and setgid to their primary
group.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KeepBindCapabilities 0|1|auto
<br>
On Linux, when we are started as root and we switch our
identity using the User option, the KeepBindCapabilities
option tells us whether to try to retain our ability to bind
<br>
to low ports. If this value is 1, we try to keep the
capability; if it is 0 we do not; and if it is auto, we keep
the capability only if we are configured to listen on a low
<br>
port. (Default: auto.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HardwareAccel 0|1 <br>
If non-zero, try to use built-in (static) crypto hardware
acceleration when available. (Default: 0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AccelName NAME <br>
When using OpenSSL hardware crypto acceleration attempt to
load the dynamic engine of this name. This must be used for
any dynamic hardware engine. Names can be verified with <br>
the openssl engine command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AccelDir DIR <br>
Specify this option if using dynamic hardware acceleration
and the engine implementation library resides somewhere
other than the OpenSSL default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AvoidDiskWrites 0|1 <br>
If non-zero, try to write to disk less frequently than we
would otherwise. This is useful when running on flash memory
or other media that support only a limited number of <br>
writes. (Default: 0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CircuitPriorityHalflife NUM1
<br>
If this value is set, we override the default algorithm for
choosing which circuit&acirc;s cell to deliver or relay
next. When the value is 0, we round-robin between the active
<br>
circuits on a connection, delivering one cell from each in
turn. When the value is positive, we prefer delivering cells
from whichever connection has the lowest weighted cell <br>
count, where cells are weighted exponentially according to
the supplied CircuitPriorityHalflife value (in seconds). If
this option is not set at all, we use the behavior <br>
recommended in the current consensus networkstatus. This is
an advanced option; you generally shouldn&acirc;t have to
mess with it. (Default: not set)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CountPrivateBandwidth 0|1 <br>
If this option is set, then Tor&acirc;s rate-limiting
applies not only to remote connections, but also to
connections to private addresses like 127.0.0.1 or 10.0.0.1.
This is <br>
mostly useful for debugging rate-limiting. (Default: 0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CLIENT OPTIONS <br>
The following options are useful only for clients (that is,
if SocksPort, TransPort, DNSPort, or NATDPort is
non-zero):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AllowInvalidNodes
entry|exit|middle|introduction|rendezvous|... <br>
If some Tor servers are obviously not working right, the
directory authorities can manually mark them as invalid,
meaning that it&acirc;s not recommended you use them for
entry or <br>
exit positions in your circuits. You can opt to use them in
some circuit positions, though. The default is
&quot;middle,rendezvous&quot;, and other choices are not
advised.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ExcludeSingleHopRelays 0|1 <br>
This option controls whether circuits built by Tor will
include relays with the AllowSingleHopExits flag set to
true. If ExcludeSingleHopRelays is set to 0, these relays
will <br>
be included. Note that these relays might be at higher risk
of being seized or observed, so they are not normally
included. Also note that relatively few clients turn off
<br>
this option, so using these relays might make your client
stand out. (Default: 1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bridge [transport] IP:ORPort
[fingerprint] <br>
When set along with UseBridges, instructs Tor to use the
relay at &quot;IP:ORPort&quot; as a &quot;bridge&quot;
relaying into the Tor network. If &quot;fingerprint&quot; is
provided (using the same format <br>
as for DirAuthority), we will verify that the relay running
at that location has the right fingerprint. We also use
fingerprint to look up the bridge descriptor at the bridge
<br>
authority, if it&acirc;s provided and if
UpdateBridgesFromAuthority is set too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If &quot;transport&quot; is
provided, it must match a ClientTransportPlugin line. We
then use that pluggable transport&acirc;s proxy to transfer
data to the bridge, rather than connecting to <br>
the bridge directly. Some transports use a
transport-specific method to work out the remote address to
connect to. These transports typically ignore the
&quot;IP:ORPort&quot; specified <br>
in the bridge line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LearnCircuitBuildTimeout 0|1
<br>
If 0, CircuitBuildTimeout adaptive learning is disabled.
(Default: 1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CircuitBuildTimeout NUM <br>
Try for at most NUM seconds when building circuits. If the
circuit isn&acirc;t open in that time, give up on it. If
LearnCircuitBuildTimeout is 1, this value serves as the
initial <br>
value to use before a timeout is learned. If
LearnCircuitBuildTimeout is 0, this value is the only value
used. (Default: 60 seconds)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CircuitIdleTimeout NUM <br>
If we have kept a clean (never used) circuit around for NUM
seconds, then close it. This way when the Tor client is
entirely idle, it can expire all of its circuits, and then
<br>
expire its TLS connections. Also, if we end up making a
circuit that is not useful for exiting any of the requests
we&acirc;re receiving, it won&acirc;t forever take up a slot
in the <br>
circuit list. (Default: 1 hour)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CircuitStreamTimeout NUM <br>
If non-zero, this option overrides our internal timeout
schedule for how many seconds until we detach a stream from
a circuit and try a new circuit. If your network is <br>
particularly slow, you might want to set this to a number
like 60. (Default: 0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ClientOnly 0|1 <br>
If set to 1, Tor will not run as a relay or serve directory
requests, even if the ORPort, ExtORPort, or DirPort options
are set. (This config option is mostly unnecessary: we <br>
added it back when we were considering having Tor clients
auto-promote themselves to being relays if they were stable
and fast enough. The current behavior is simply that Tor
<br>
is a client unless ORPort, ExtORPort, or DirPort are
configured.) (Default: 0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ExcludeNodes node,node,... <br>
A list of identity fingerprints, country codes, and address
patterns of nodes to avoid when building a circuit. Country
codes are 2-letter ISO3166 codes, and must be wrapped <br>
in braces; fingerprints may be preceded by a dollar sign.
(Example: ExcludeNodes
ABCD1234CDEF5678ABCD1234CDEF5678ABCD1234, {cc},
255.254.0.0/8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, this option is
treated as a preference that Tor is allowed to override in
order to keep working. For example, if you try to connect to
a hidden service, but you <br>
have excluded all of the hidden service&acirc;s introduction
points, Tor will connect to one of them anyway. If you do
not want this behavior, set the StrictNodes option <br>
(documented below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note also that if you are a
relay, this (and the other node selection options below)
only affects your own circuits that Tor builds for you.
Clients can still build circuits <br>
through you to any node. Controllers can tell Tor to build
circuits through any node.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Country codes are
case-insensitive. The code &quot;{??}&quot; refers to nodes
whose country can&acirc;t be identified. No country code,
including {??}, works if no GeoIPFile can be loaded. <br>
See also the GeoIPExcludeUnknown option below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ExcludeExitNodes node,node,...
<br>
A list of identity fingerprints, country codes, and address
patterns of nodes to never use when picking an exit
node---that is, a node that delivers traffic for you outside
<br>
the Tor network. Note that any node listed in ExcludeNodes
is automatically considered to be part of this list too. See
the ExcludeNodes option for more information on how to <br>
specify nodes. See also the caveats on the
&quot;ExitNodes&quot; option below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GeoIPExcludeUnknown 0|1|auto
<br>
If this option is set to auto, then whenever any country
code is set in ExcludeNodes or ExcludeExitNodes, all nodes
with unknown country ({??} and possibly {A1}) are treated
<br>
as excluded as well. If this option is set to 1, then all
unknown countries are treated as excluded in ExcludeNodes
and ExcludeExitNodes. This option has no effect when a <br>
GeoIP file isn&acirc;t configured or can&acirc;t be found.
(Default: auto)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ExitNodes node,node,... <br>
A list of identity fingerprints, country codes, and address
patterns of nodes to use as exit node---that is, a node that
delivers traffic for you outside the Tor network. See <br>
the ExcludeNodes option for more information on how to
specify nodes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that if you list too few
nodes here, or if you exclude too many exit nodes with
ExcludeExitNodes, you can degrade functionality. For
example, if none of the exits you <br>
list allows traffic on port 80 or 443, you won&acirc;t be
able to browse the web.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note also that not every circuit
is used to deliver traffic outside of the Tor network. It is
normal to see non-exit circuits (such as those used to
connect to hidden <br>
services, those that do directory fetches, those used for
relay reachability self-tests, and so on) that end at a
non-exit node. To keep a node from being used entirely, see
<br>
ExcludeNodes and StrictNodes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ExcludeNodes option
overrides this option: any node listed in both ExitNodes and
ExcludeNodes is treated as excluded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The .exit address notation, if
enabled via AllowDotExit, overrides this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EntryNodes node,node,... <br>
A list of identity fingerprints and country codes of nodes
to use for the first hop in your normal circuits. Normal
circuits include all circuits except for direct <br>
connections to directory servers. The Bridge option
overrides this option; if you have configured bridges and
UseBridges is 1, the Bridges are used as your entry
nodes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ExcludeNodes option
overrides this option: any node listed in both EntryNodes
and ExcludeNodes is treated as excluded. See the
ExcludeNodes option for more information on <br>
how to specify nodes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">StrictNodes 0|1 <br>
If StrictNodes is set to 1, Tor will treat the ExcludeNodes
option as a requirement to follow for all the circuits you
generate, even if doing so will break functionality for <br>
you. If StrictNodes is set to 0, Tor will still try to avoid
nodes in the ExcludeNodes list, but it will err on the side
of avoiding unexpected errors. Specifically, <br>
StrictNodes 0 tells Tor that it is okay to use an excluded
node when it is necessary to perform relay reachability
self-tests, connect to a hidden service, provide a hidden
<br>
service to a client, fulfill a .exit request, upload
directory information, or download directory information.
(Default: 0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FascistFirewall 0|1 <br>
If 1, Tor will only create outgoing connections to ORs
running on ports that your firewall allows (defaults to 80
and 443; see FirewallPorts). This will allow you to run Tor
<br>
as a client behind a firewall with restrictive policies, but
will not allow you to run as a server behind such a
firewall. If you prefer more fine-grained control, use <br>
ReachableAddresses instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FirewallPorts PORTS <br>
A list of ports that your firewall allows you to connect to.
Only used when FascistFirewall is set. This option is
deprecated; use ReachableAddresses instead. (Default: 80,
<br>
443)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ReachableAddresses
ADDR[/MASK][:PORT]... <br>
A comma-separated list of IP addresses and ports that your
firewall allows you to connect to. The format is as for the
addresses in ExitPolicy, except that &quot;accept&quot; is
<br>
understood unless &quot;reject&quot; is explicitly provided.
For example, &rsquo;ReachableAddresses 99.0.0.0/8, reject
18.0.0.0/8:80, accept *:80&rsquo; means that your firewall
allows connections <br>
to everything inside net 99, rejects port 80 connections to
net 18, and accepts connections to port 80 otherwise.
(Default: &rsquo;accept *:*&rsquo;.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ReachableDirAddresses
ADDR[/MASK][:PORT]... <br>
Like ReachableAddresses, a list of addresses and ports. Tor
will obey these restrictions when fetching directory
information, using standard HTTP GET requests. If not set
<br>
explicitly then the value of ReachableAddresses is used. If
HTTPProxy is set then these connections will go through that
proxy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ReachableORAddresses
ADDR[/MASK][:PORT]... <br>
Like ReachableAddresses, a list of addresses and ports. Tor
will obey these restrictions when connecting to Onion
Routers, using TLS/SSL. If not set explicitly then the value
<br>
of ReachableAddresses is used. If HTTPSProxy is set then
these connections will go through that proxy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The separation between
ReachableORAddresses and ReachableDirAddresses is only
interesting when you are connecting through proxies (see
HTTPProxy and HTTPSProxy). Most proxies <br>
limit TLS connections (which Tor uses to connect to Onion
Routers) to port 443, and some limit HTTP GET requests
(which Tor uses for fetching directory information) to port
<br>
80.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HidServAuth onion-address
auth-cookie [service-name] <br>
Client authorization for a hidden service. Valid onion
addresses contain 16 characters in a-z2-7 plus
&quot;.onion&quot;, and valid auth cookies contain 22
characters in A-Za-z0-9+/. <br>
The service name is only used for internal purposes, e.g.,
for Tor controllers. This option may be used multiple times
for different hidden services. If a hidden service uses <br>
authorization and this option is not set, the hidden service
is not accessible. Hidden services can be configured to
require authorization using the <br>
HiddenServiceAuthorizeClient option.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">CloseHSClientCircuitsImmediatelyOnTimeout
0|1 <br>
If 1, Tor will close unfinished hidden service client
circuits which have not moved closer to connecting to their
destination hidden service when their internal state has not
<br>
changed for the duration of the current circuit-build
timeout. Otherwise, such circuits will be left open, in the
hope that they will finish connecting to their destination
<br>
hidden services. In either case, another set of introduction
and rendezvous circuits for the same destination hidden
service will be launched. (Default: 0)</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">CloseHSServiceRendCircuitsImmediatelyOnTimeout
0|1 <br>
If 1, Tor will close unfinished hidden-service-side
rendezvous circuits after the current circuit-build timeout.
Otherwise, such circuits will be left open, in the hope that
<br>
they will finish connecting to their destinations. In either
case, another rendezvous circuit for the same destination
client will be launched. (Default: 0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LongLivedPorts PORTS <br>
A list of ports for services that tend to have long-running
connections (e.g. chat and interactive shells). Circuits for
streams that use these ports will contain only <br>
high-uptime nodes, to reduce the chance that a node will go
down before the stream is finished. Note that the list is
also honored for circuits (both client and service side)
<br>
involving hidden services whose virtual port is in this
list. (Default: 21, 22, 706, 1863, 5050, 5190, 5222, 5223,
6523, 6667, 6697, 8300)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MapAddress address newaddress
<br>
When a request for address arrives to Tor, it will transform
to newaddress before processing it. For example, if you
always want connections to www.example.com to exit via <br>
torserver (where torserver is the fingerprint of the
server), use &quot;MapAddress www.example.com
www.example.com.torserver.exit&quot;. If the value is
prefixed with a &quot;*.&quot;, matches <br>
an entire domain. For example, if you always want
connections to example.com and any if its subdomains to exit
via torserver (where torserver is the fingerprint of the
<br>
server), use &quot;MapAddress *.example.com
*.example.com.torserver.exit&quot;. (Note the leading
&quot;*.&quot; in each part of the directive.) You can also
redirect all subdomains of a domain <br>
to a single address. For example, &quot;MapAddress
*.example.com www.example.com&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. When evaluating MapAddress
expressions Tor stops when it hits the most recently added
expression that matches the requested address. So if you
have the following in your <br>
torrc, www.torproject.org will map to 1.1.1.1:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MapAddress www.torproject.org
2.2.2.2 <br>
MapAddress www.torproject.org 1.1.1.1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Tor evaluates the MapAddress
configuration until it finds no matches. So if you have the
following in your torrc, www.torproject.org will map to
2.2.2.2:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MapAddress 1.1.1.1 2.2.2.2 <br>
MapAddress www.torproject.org 1.1.1.1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. The following MapAddress
expression is invalid (and will be ignored) because you
cannot map from a specific address to a wildcard
address:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MapAddress www.torproject.org
*.torproject.org.torserver.exit</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. Using a wildcard to match
only part of a string (as in *ample.com) is also
invalid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NewCircuitPeriod NUM <br>
Every NUM seconds consider whether to build a new circuit.
(Default: 30 seconds)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MaxCircuitDirtiness NUM <br>
Feel free to reuse a circuit that was first used at most NUM
seconds ago, but never attach a new stream to a circuit that
is too old. For hidden services, this applies to the <br>
last time a circuit was used, not the first. Circuits with
streams constructed with SOCKS authentication via SocksPorts
that have KeepAliveIsolateSOCKSAuth ignore this value. <br>
(Default: 10 minutes)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MaxClientCircuitsPending NUM
<br>
Do not allow more than NUM circuits to be pending at a time
for handling client streams. A circuit is pending if we have
begun constructing it, but it has not yet been <br>
completely constructed. (Default: 32)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NodeFamily node,node,... <br>
The Tor servers, defined by their identity fingerprints,
constitute a &quot;family&quot; of similar or
co-administered servers, so never use any two of them in the
same circuit. <br>
Defining a NodeFamily is only needed when a server
doesn&acirc;t list the family itself (with MyFamily). This
option can be used multiple times; each instance defines a
separate <br>
family. In addition to nodes, you can also list IP address
and ranges and country codes in {curly braces}. See the
ExcludeNodes option for more information on how to specify
<br>
nodes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EnforceDistinctSubnets 0|1 <br>
If 1, Tor will not put two servers whose IP addresses are
&quot;too close&quot; on the same circuit. Currently, two
addresses are &quot;too close&quot; if they lie in the same
/16 range. <br>
(Default: 1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SocksPort
[address:]port|unix:path|auto [flags] [isolation flags] <br>
Open this port to listen for connections from SOCKS-speaking
applications. Set this to 0 if you don&acirc;t want to allow
application connections via SOCKS. Set it to
&quot;auto&quot; to <br>
have Tor pick a port for you. This directive can be
specified multiple times to bind to multiple
addresses/ports. If a unix domain socket is used, you may
quote the path <br>
using standard C escape sequences. (Default: 9050)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: Although this option
allows you to specify an IP address other than localhost,
you should do so only with extreme caution. The SOCKS
protocol is unencrypted and (as we <br>
use it) unauthenticated, so exposing it in this way could
leak your information to anybody watching your network, and
allow anybody to use your computer as an open proxy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The isolation flags arguments
give Tor rules for which streams received on this SocksPort
are allowed to share circuits with one another. Recognized
isolation flags are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IsolateClientAddr <br>
Don&acirc;t share circuits with streams from a different
client address. (On by default and strongly recommended when
supported; you can disable it with NoIsolateClientAddr. <br>
Unsupported and force-disabled when using Unix domain
sockets.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IsolateSOCKSAuth <br>
Don&acirc;t share circuits with streams for which different
SOCKS authentication was provided. (On by default; you can
disable it with NoIsolateSOCKSAuth.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IsolateClientProtocol <br>
Don&acirc;t share circuits with streams using a different
protocol. (SOCKS 4, SOCKS 5, TransPort connections, NATDPort
connections, and DNSPort requests are all considered to <br>
be different protocols.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IsolateDestPort <br>
Don&acirc;t share circuits with streams targeting a
different destination port.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IsolateDestAddr <br>
Don&acirc;t share circuits with streams targeting a
different destination address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KeepAliveIsolateSOCKSAuth <br>
If IsolateSOCKSAuth is enabled, keep alive circuits that
have streams with SOCKS authentication set indefinitely.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SessionGroup=INT <br>
If no other isolation rules would prevent it, allow streams
on this port to share circuits with streams from every other
port with the same session group. (By default, <br>
streams received on different SocksPorts, TransPorts, etc
are always isolated from one another. This option overrides
that behavior.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other recognized flags for a
SocksPort are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NoIPv4Traffic <br>
Tell exits to not connect to IPv4 addresses in response to
SOCKS requests on this connection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IPv6Traffic <br>
Tell exits to allow IPv6 addresses in response to SOCKS
requests on this connection, so long as SOCKS5 is in use.
(SOCKS4 can&acirc;t handle IPv6.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PreferIPv6 <br>
Tells exits that, if a host has both an IPv4 and an IPv6
address, we would prefer to connect to it via IPv6. (IPv4 is
the default.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NoDNSRequest <br>
Do not ask exits to resolve DNS addresses in SOCKS5
requests. Tor will connect to IPv4 addresses, IPv6 addresses
(if IPv6Traffic is set) and .onion addresses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NoOnionTraffic <br>
Do not connect to .onion addresses in SOCKS5 requests.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OnionTrafficOnly <br>
Tell the tor client to only connect to .onion addresses in
response to SOCKS5 requests on this connection. This is
equivalent to NoDNSRequest, NoIPv4Traffic, <br>
NoIPv6Traffic. The corresponding NoOnionTrafficOnly flag is
not supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CacheIPv4DNS <br>
Tells the client to remember IPv4 DNS answers we receive
from exit nodes via this connection. (On by default.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CacheIPv6DNS <br>
Tells the client to remember IPv6 DNS answers we receive
from exit nodes via this connection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GroupWritable <br>
Unix domain sockets only: makes the socket get created as
group-writable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WorldWritable <br>
Unix domain sockets only: makes the socket get created as
world-writable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CacheDNS <br>
Tells the client to remember all DNS answers we receive from
exit nodes via this connection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UseIPv4Cache <br>
Tells the client to use any cached IPv4 DNS answers we have
when making requests via this connection. (NOTE: This
option, along UseIPv6Cache and UseDNSCache, can harm <br>
your anonymity, and probably won&acirc;t help performance as
much as you might expect. Use with care!)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UseIPv6Cache <br>
Tells the client to use any cached IPv6 DNS answers we have
when making requests via this connection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UseDNSCache <br>
Tells the client to use any cached DNS answers we have when
making requests via this connection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PreferIPv6Automap <br>
When serving a hostname lookup request on this port that
should get automapped (according to AutomapHostsOnResolve),
if we could return either an IPv4 or an IPv6 answer, <br>
prefer an IPv6 answer. (On by default.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PreferSOCKSNoAuth <br>
Ordinarily, when an application offers both
&quot;username/password authentication&quot; and &quot;no
authentication&quot; to Tor via SOCKS5, Tor selects
username/password authentication so <br>
that IsolateSOCKSAuth can work. This can confuse some
applications, if they offer a username/password combination
then get confused when asked for one. You can disable <br>
this behavior, so that Tor will select &quot;No
authentication&quot; when IsolateSOCKSAuth is disabled, or
when this option is set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Flags are processed left to
right. If flags conflict, the last flag on the <br>
line is used, and all earlier flags are ignored. No error is
issued for <br>
conflicting flags.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SocksListenAddress IP[:PORT]
<br>
Bind to this address to listen for connections from
Socks-speaking applications. (Default: 127.0.0.1) You can
also specify a port (e.g. 192.168.0.1:9100). This directive
can <br>
be specified multiple times to bind to multiple
addresses/ports. (DEPRECATED: As of 0.2.3.x-alpha, you can
now use multiple SocksPort entries, and provide addresses
for <br>
SocksPort entries, so SocksListenAddress no longer has a
purpose. For backward compatibility, SocksListenAddress is
only allowed when SocksPort is just a port number.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SocksPolicy policy,policy,...
<br>
Set an entrance policy for this server, to limit who can
connect to the SocksPort and DNSPort ports. The policies
have the same form as exit policies below, except that port
<br>
specifiers are ignored. Any address not matched by some
entry in the policy is accepted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SocksTimeout NUM <br>
Let a socks connection wait NUM seconds handshaking, and NUM
seconds unattached waiting for an appropriate circuit,
before we fail it. (Default: 2 minutes)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TokenBucketRefillInterval NUM
[msec|second] <br>
Set the refill interval of Tor&acirc;s token bucket to NUM
milliseconds. NUM must be between 1 and 1000, inclusive.
Note that the configured bandwidth limits are still
expressed in <br>
bytes per second: this option only affects the frequency
with which Tor checks to see whether previously exhausted
connections may read again. (Default: 100 msec)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TrackHostExits host,.domain,...
<br>
For each value in the comma separated list, Tor will track
recent connections to hosts that match this value and
attempt to reuse the same exit node for each. If the value
is <br>
prepended with a &rsquo;.&rsquo;, it is treated as matching
an entire domain. If one of the values is just a
&rsquo;.&rsquo;, it means match everything. This option is
useful if you frequently <br>
connect to sites that will expire all your authentication
cookies (i.e. log you out) if your IP address changes. Note
that this option does have the disadvantage of making it
<br>
more clear that a given history is associated with a single
user. However, most people who would wish to observe this
will observe it through cookies or other <br>
protocol-specific means anyhow.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TrackHostExitsExpire NUM <br>
Since exit servers go up and down, it is desirable to expire
the association between host and exit server after NUM
seconds. The default is 1800 seconds (30 minutes).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UpdateBridgesFromAuthority 0|1
<br>
When set (along with UseBridges), Tor will try to fetch
bridge descriptors from the configured bridge authorities
when feasible. It will fall back to a direct request if the
<br>
authority responds with a 404. (Default: 0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UseBridges 0|1 <br>
When set, Tor will fetch descriptors for each bridge listed
in the &quot;Bridge&quot; config lines, and use these relays
as both entry guards and directory guards. (Default: 0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UseEntryGuards 0|1 <br>
If this option is set to 1, we pick a few long-term entry
servers, and try to stick with them. This is desirable
because constantly changing servers increases the odds that
<br>
an adversary who owns some servers will observe a fraction
of your paths. Entry Guards can not be used by Directory
Authorities, Single Onion Services, and Tor2web clients.
<br>
In these cases, the this option is ignored. (Default: 1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UseEntryGuardsAsDirGuards 0|1
<br>
If this option is set to 1, and UseEntryGuards is also set
to 1, we try to use our entry guards as directory guards,
and failing that, pick more nodes to act as our directory
<br>
guards. This helps prevent an adversary from enumerating
clients. It&acirc;s only available for clients (non-relay,
non-bridge) that aren&acirc;t configured to download any
non-default <br>
directory material. It doesn&acirc;t currently do anything
when we lack a live consensus. (Default: 1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GuardfractionFile FILENAME <br>
V3 authoritative directories only. Configures the location
of the guardfraction file which contains information about
how long relays have been guards. (Default: unset)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UseGuardFraction 0|1|auto <br>
This torrc option specifies whether clients should use the
guardfraction information found in the consensus during path
selection. If it&acirc;s set to auto, clients will do what
<br>
the UseGuardFraction consensus parameter tells them to do.
(Default: auto)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NumEntryGuards NUM <br>
If UseEntryGuards is set to 1, we will try to pick a total
of NUM routers as long-term entries for our circuits. If NUM
is 0, we try to learn the number from the <br>
NumEntryGuards consensus parameter, and default to 3 if the
consensus parameter isn&acirc;t set. (Default: 0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NumDirectoryGuards NUM <br>
If UseEntryGuardsAsDirectoryGuards is enabled, we try to
make sure we have at least NUM routers to use as directory
guards. If this option is set to 0, use the value from the
<br>
NumDirectoryGuards consensus parameter, falling back to the
value from NumEntryGuards if the consensus parameter is 0 or
isn&acirc;t set. (Default: 0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GuardLifetime N
days|weeks|months <br>
If nonzero, and UseEntryGuards is set, minimum time to keep
a guard before picking a new one. If zero, we use the
GuardLifetime parameter from the consensus directory. No
<br>
value here may be less than 1 month or greater than 5 years;
out-of-range values are clamped. (Default: 0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SafeSocks 0|1 <br>
When this option is enabled, Tor will reject application
connections that use unsafe variants of the socks protocol
&acirc; ones that only provide an IP address, meaning the
<br>
application is doing a DNS resolve first. Specifically,
these are socks4 and socks5 when not doing remote DNS.
(Default: 0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TestSocks 0|1 <br>
When this option is enabled, Tor will make a notice-level
log entry for each connection to the Socks port indicating
whether the request used a safe socks protocol or an <br>
unsafe one (see above entry on SafeSocks). This helps to
determine whether an application using Tor is possibly
leaking DNS requests. (Default: 0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WarnUnsafeSocks 0|1 <br>
When this option is enabled, Tor will warn whenever a
request is received that only contains an IP address instead
of a hostname. Allowing applications to do DNS resolves <br>
themselves is usually a bad idea and can leak your location
to attackers. (Default: 1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VirtualAddrNetworkIPv4
Address/bits</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VirtualAddrNetworkIPv6
[Address]/bits <br>
When Tor needs to assign a virtual (unused) address because
of a MAPADDRESS command from the controller or the
AutomapHostsOnResolve feature, Tor picks an unassigned
address <br>
from this range. (Defaults: 127.192.0.0/10 and [FE80::]/10
respectively.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When providing proxy server
service to a network of computers using a tool like
dns-proxy-tor, change the IPv4 network to
&quot;10.192.0.0/10&quot; or &quot;172.16.0.0/12&quot; and
change the <br>
IPv6 network to &quot;[FC00::]/7&quot;. The default
VirtualAddrNetwork address ranges on a properly configured
machine will route to the loopback or link-local interface.
The maximum <br>
number of bits for the network prefix is set to 104 for IPv6
and 16 for IPv4. However, a wider network - smaller prefix
length</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; is preferable
since it reduces the chances for an attacker to guess the
used IP. For local use, no change to the default
VirtualAddrNetwork setting is needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AllowNonRFC953Hostnames 0|1 <br>
When this option is disabled, Tor blocks hostnames
containing illegal characters (like @ and :) rather than
sending them to an exit node to be resolved. This helps trap
<br>
accidental attempts to resolve URLs and so on. (Default:
0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AllowDotExit 0|1 <br>
If enabled, we convert &quot;www.google.com.foo.exit&quot;
addresses on the SocksPort/TransPort/NATDPort into
&quot;www.google.com&quot; addresses that exit from the node
&quot;foo&quot;. Disabled by <br>
default since attacking websites and exit relays can use it
to manipulate your path selection. (Default: 0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FastFirstHopPK 0|1|auto <br>
When this option is disabled, Tor uses the public key step
for the first hop of creating circuits. Skipping it is
generally safe since we have already used TLS to <br>
authenticate the relay and to establish forward-secure keys.
Turning this option off makes circuit building a little
slower. Setting this option to &quot;auto&quot; takes advice
from <br>
the authorities in the latest consensus about whether to use
this feature.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that Tor will always use
the public key step for the first hop if it&acirc;s
operating as a relay, and it will never use the public key
step if it doesn&acirc;t yet know the onion <br>
key of the first hop. (Default: auto)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TransPort [address:]port|auto
[isolation flags] <br>
Open this port to listen for transparent proxy connections.
Set this to 0 if you don&acirc;t want to allow transparent
proxy connections. Set the port to &quot;auto&quot; to have
Tor pick a <br>
port for you. This directive can be specified multiple times
to bind to multiple addresses/ports. See SOCKSPort for an
explanation of isolation flags.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TransPort requires OS support
for transparent proxies, such as BSDs&rsquo; pf or
Linux&acirc;s IPTables. If you&acirc;re planning to use Tor
as a transparent proxy for a network, you&acirc;ll want <br>
to examine and change VirtualAddrNetwork from the default
setting. You&acirc;ll also want to set the
TransListenAddress option for the network you&acirc;d like
to proxy. (Default: 0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TransListenAddress IP[:PORT]
<br>
Bind to this address to listen for transparent proxy
connections. (Default: 127.0.0.1). This is useful for
exporting a transparent proxy server to an entire network.
<br>
(DEPRECATED: As of 0.2.3.x-alpha, you can now use multiple
TransPort entries, and provide addresses for TransPort
entries, so TransListenAddress no longer has a purpose. For
<br>
backward compatibility, TransListenAddress is only allowed
when TransPort is just a port number.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TransProxyType
default|TPROXY|ipfw|pf-divert <br>
TransProxyType may only be enabled when there is transparent
proxy listener enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Set this to &quot;TPROXY&quot;
if you wish to be able to use the TPROXY Linux module to
transparently proxy connections that are configured using
the TransPort option. This setting <br>
lets the listener on the TransPort accept connections for
all addresses, even when the TransListenAddress is
configured for an internal address. Detailed information on
how <br>
to configure the TPROXY feature can be found in the Linux
kernel source tree in the file
Documentation/networking/tproxy.txt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Set this option to
&quot;ipfw&quot; to use the FreeBSD ipfw interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On *BSD operating systems when
using pf, set this to &quot;pf-divert&quot; to take
advantage of divert-to rules, which do not modify the
packets like rdr-to rules do. Detailed <br>
information on how to configure pf to use divert-to rules
can be found in the pf.conf(5) manual page. On OpenBSD,
divert-to is available to use on versions greater than or
<br>
equal to OpenBSD 4.4.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Set this to &quot;default&quot;,
or leave it unconfigured, to use regular IPTables on Linux,
or to use pf rdr-to rules on *BSD systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(Default:
&quot;default&quot;.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NATDPort [address:]port|auto
[isolation flags] <br>
Open this port to listen for connections from old versions
of ipfw (as included in old versions of FreeBSD, etc) using
the NATD protocol. Use 0 if you don&acirc;t want to allow
<br>
NATD connections. Set the port to &quot;auto&quot; to have
Tor pick a port for you. This directive can be specified
multiple times to bind to multiple addresses/ports. See
SocksPort <br>
for an explanation of isolation flags.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is only for people
who cannot use TransPort. (Default: 0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NATDListenAddress IP[:PORT] <br>
Bind to this address to listen for NATD connections.
(DEPRECATED: As of 0.2.3.x-alpha, you can now use multiple
NATDPort entries, and provide addresses for NATDPort
entries, <br>
so NATDListenAddress no longer has a purpose. For backward
compatibility, NATDListenAddress is only allowed when
NATDPort is just a port number.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AutomapHostsOnResolve 0|1 <br>
When this option is enabled, and we get a request to resolve
an address that ends with one of the suffixes in
AutomapHostsSuffixes, we map an unused virtual address to
that <br>
address, and return the new virtual address. This is handy
for making &quot;.onion&quot; addresses work with
applications that resolve an address and then connect to it.
(Default: 0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AutomapHostsSuffixes
SUFFIX,SUFFIX,... <br>
A comma-separated list of suffixes to use with
AutomapHostsOnResolve. The &quot;.&quot; suffix is
equivalent to &quot;all addresses.&quot; (Default:
.exit,.onion).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DNSPort [address:]port|auto
[isolation flags] <br>
If non-zero, open this port to listen for UDP DNS requests,
and resolve them anonymously. This port only handles A,
AAAA, and PTR requests---it doesn&acirc;t handle arbitrary
DNS <br>
request types. Set the port to &quot;auto&quot; to have Tor
pick a port for you. This directive can be specified
multiple times to bind to multiple addresses/ports. See
SocksPort for <br>
an explanation of isolation flags. (Default: 0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DNSListenAddress IP[:PORT] <br>
Bind to this address to listen for DNS connections.
(DEPRECATED: As of 0.2.3.x-alpha, you can now use multiple
DNSPort entries, and provide addresses for DNSPort entries,
so <br>
DNSListenAddress no longer has a purpose. For backward
compatibility, DNSListenAddress is only allowed when DNSPort
is just a port number.)</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">ClientDNSRejectInternalAddresses
0|1 <br>
If true, Tor does not believe any anonymously retrieved DNS
answer that tells it that an address resolves to an internal
address (like 127.0.0.1 or 192.168.0.1). This option <br>
prevents certain browser-based attacks; don&acirc;t turn it
off unless you know what you&acirc;re doing. (Default:
1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ClientRejectInternalAddresses
0|1 <br>
If true, Tor does not try to fulfill requests to connect to
an internal address (like 127.0.0.1 or 192.168.0.1) unless a
exit node is specifically requested (for example, via <br>
a .exit hostname, or a controller request). (Default: 1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DownloadExtraInfo 0|1 <br>
If true, Tor downloads and caches &quot;extra-info&quot;
documents. These documents contain information about servers
other than the information in their regular server
descriptors. <br>
Tor does not use this information for anything itself; to
save bandwidth, leave this option turned off. (Default:
0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WarnPlaintextPorts port,port,...
<br>
Tells Tor to issue a warnings whenever the user tries to
make an anonymous connection to one of these ports. This
option is designed to alert users to services that risk <br>
sending passwords in the clear. (Default:
23,109,110,143)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RejectPlaintextPorts
port,port,... <br>
Like WarnPlaintextPorts, but instead of warning about risky
port uses, Tor will instead refuse to make the connection.
(Default: None)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AllowSingleHopCircuits 0|1 <br>
When this option is set, the attached Tor controller can use
relays that have the AllowSingleHopExits option turned on to
build one-hop Tor connections. (Default: 0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OptimisticData 0|1|auto <br>
When this option is set, and Tor is using an exit node that
supports the feature, it will try optimistically to send
data to the exit node without waiting for the exit node <br>
to report whether the connection succeeded. This can save a
round-trip time for protocols like HTTP where the client
talks first. If OptimisticData is set to auto, Tor will <br>
look at the UseOptimisticData parameter in the
networkstatus. (Default: auto)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tor2webMode 0|1 <br>
When this option is set, Tor connects to hidden services
non-anonymously. This option also disables client
connections to non-hidden-service hostnames through Tor. It
must <br>
only be used when running a tor2web Hidden Service web
proxy. To enable this option the compile time flag
--enable-tor2web-mode must be specified. Since Tor2webMode
is <br>
non-anonymous, you can not run an anonymous Hidden Service
on a tor version compiled with Tor2webMode. (Default: 0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tor2webRendezvousPoints
node,node,... <br>
A list of identity fingerprints, nicknames, country codes
and address patterns of nodes that are allowed to be used as
RPs in HS circuits; any other nodes will not be used as <br>
RPs. (Example: Tor2webRendezvousPoints Fastyfasty,
ABCD1234CDEF5678ABCD1234CDEF5678ABCD1234, {cc},
255.254.0.0/8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This feature can only be used if
Tor2webMode is also enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ExcludeNodes have higher
priority than Tor2webRendezvousPoints, which means that
nodes specified in ExcludeNodes will not be picked as
RPs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no nodes in
Tor2webRendezvousPoints are currently available for use, Tor
will choose a random node when building HS circuits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UseMicrodescriptors 0|1|auto
<br>
Microdescriptors are a smaller version of the information
that Tor needs in order to build its circuits. Using
microdescriptors makes Tor clients download less directory
<br>
information, thus saving bandwidth. Directory caches need to
fetch regular descriptors and microdescriptors, so this
option doesn&acirc;t save any bandwidth for them. If this
<br>
option is set to &quot;auto&quot; (recommended) then it is
on for all clients that do not set FetchUselessDescriptors.
(Default: auto)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PathBiasCircThreshold NUM</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PathBiasNoticeRate NUM</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PathBiasWarnRate NUM</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PathBiasExtremeRate NUM</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PathBiasDropGuards NUM</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PathBiasScaleThreshold NUM <br>
These options override the default behavior of Tor&acirc;s
(currently experimental) path bias detection algorithm. To
try to find broken or misbehaving guard nodes, Tor looks for
<br>
nodes where more than a certain fraction of circuits through
that guard fail to get built.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The PathBiasCircThreshold option
controls how many circuits we need to build through a guard
before we make these checks. The PathBiasNoticeRate,
PathBiasWarnRate and <br>
PathBiasExtremeRate options control what fraction of
circuits must succeed through a guard so we won&acirc;t
write log messages. If less than PathBiasExtremeRate
circuits succeed <br>
and PathBiasDropGuards is set to 1, we disable use of that
guard.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When we have seen more than
PathBiasScaleThreshold circuits through a guard, we scale
our observations by 0.5 (governed by the consensus) so that
new observations don&acirc;t get <br>
swamped by old ones.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, or if a negative
value is provided for one of these options, Tor uses
reasonable defaults from the networkstatus consensus
document. If no defaults are available <br>
there, these options default to 150, .70, .50, .30, 0, and
300 respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PathBiasUseThreshold NUM</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PathBiasNoticeUseRate NUM</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PathBiasExtremeUseRate NUM</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PathBiasScaleUseThreshold NUM
<br>
Similar to the above options, these options override the
default behavior of Tor&acirc;s (currently experimental)
path use bias detection algorithm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Where as the path bias
parameters govern thresholds for successfully building
circuits, these four path use bias parameters govern
thresholds only for circuit usage. Circuits <br>
which receive no stream usage are not counted by this
detection algorithm. A used circuit is considered successful
if it is capable of carrying streams or otherwise receiving
<br>
well-formed responses to RELAY cells.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, or if a negative
value is provided for one of these options, Tor uses
reasonable defaults from the networkstatus consensus
document. If no defaults are available <br>
there, these options default to 20, .80, .60, and 100,
respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ClientUseIPv4 0|1 <br>
If this option is set to 0, Tor will avoid connecting to
directory servers and entry nodes over IPv4. Note that
clients with an IPv4 address in a Bridge, proxy, or
pluggable <br>
transport line will try connecting over IPv4 even if
ClientUseIPv4 is set to 0. (Default: 1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ClientUseIPv6 0|1 <br>
If this option is set to 1, Tor might connect to directory
servers or entry nodes over IPv6. Note that clients
configured with an IPv6 address in a Bridge, proxy, or <br>
pluggable transport line will try connecting over IPv6 even
if ClientUseIPv6 is set to 0. (Default: 0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ClientPreferIPv6DirPort 0|1|auto
<br>
If this option is set to 1, Tor prefers a directory port
with an IPv6 address over one with IPv4, for direct
connections, if a given directory server has both. (Tor also
<br>
prefers an IPv6 DirPort if IPv4Client is set to 0.) If this
option is set to auto, clients prefer IPv4. Other things may
influence the choice. This option breaks a tie to the <br>
favor of IPv6. (Default: auto)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ClientPreferIPv6ORPort 0|1|auto
<br>
If this option is set to 1, Tor prefers an OR port with an
IPv6 address over one with IPv4 if a given entry node has
both. (Tor also prefers an IPv6 ORPort if IPv4Client is <br>
set to 0.) If this option is set to auto, Tor bridge clients
prefer the configured bridge address, and other clients
prefer IPv4. Other things may influence the choice. This
<br>
option breaks a tie to the favor of IPv6. (Default:
auto)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PathsNeededToBuildCircuits NUM
<br>
Tor clients don&acirc;t build circuits for user traffic
until they know about enough of the network so that they
could potentially construct enough of the possible paths
through <br>
the network. If this option is set to a fraction between
0.25 and 0.95, Tor won&acirc;t build circuits until it has
enough descriptors or microdescriptors to construct that
<br>
fraction of possible paths. Note that setting this option
too low can make your Tor client less anonymous, and setting
it too high can prevent your Tor client from <br>
bootstrapping. If this option is negative, Tor will use a
default value chosen by the directory authorities. If the
directory authorities do not choose a value, Tor will <br>
default to 0.6. (Default: -1.)</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">ClientBootstrapConsensusAuthorityDownloadSchedule
N,N,... <br>
Schedule for when clients should download consensuses from
authorities if they are bootstrapping (that is, they
don&acirc;t have a usable, reasonably live consensus). Only
used by <br>
clients fetching from a list of fallback directory mirrors.
This schedule is advanced by (potentially concurrent)
connection attempts, unlike other schedules, which are <br>
advanced by connection failures. (Default: 10, 11, 3600,
10800, 25200, 54000, 111600, 262800)</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">ClientBootstrapConsensusFallbackDownloadSchedule
N,N,... <br>
Schedule for when clients should download consensuses from
fallback directory mirrors if they are bootstrapping (that
is, they don&acirc;t have a usable, reasonably live <br>
consensus). Only used by clients fetching from a list of
fallback directory mirrors. This schedule is advanced by
(potentially concurrent) connection attempts, unlike other
<br>
schedules, which are advanced by connection failures.
(Default: 0, 1, 4, 11, 3600, 10800, 25200, 54000, 111600,
262800)</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">ClientBootstrapConsensusAuthorityOnlyDownloadSchedule
N,N,... <br>
Schedule for when clients should download consensuses from
authorities if they are bootstrapping (that is, they
don&acirc;t have a usable, reasonably live consensus). Only
used by <br>
clients which don&acirc;t have or won&acirc;t fetch from a
list of fallback directory mirrors. This schedule is
advanced by (potentially concurrent) connection attempts,
unlike other <br>
schedules, which are advanced by connection failures.
(Default: 0, 3, 7, 3600, 10800, 25200, 54000, 111600,
262800)</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">ClientBootstrapConsensusMaxDownloadTries
NUM <br>
Try this many times to download a consensus while
bootstrapping using fallback directory mirrors before giving
up. (Default: 7)</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">ClientBootstrapConsensusAuthorityOnlyMaxDownloadTries
NUM <br>
Try this many times to download a consensus while
bootstrapping using authorities before giving up. (Default:
4)</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">ClientBootstrapConsensusMaxInProgressTries
NUM <br>
Try this many simultaneous connections to download a
consensus before waiting for one to complete, timeout, or
error out. (Default: 4)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SERVER OPTIONS <br>
The following options are useful only for servers (that is,
if ORPort is non-zero):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Address address <br>
The IP address or fully qualified domain name of this server
(e.g. moria.mit.edu). You can leave this unset, and Tor will
guess your IP address. This IP address is the one <br>
used to tell clients and other servers where to find your
Tor server; it doesn&acirc;t affect the IP that your Tor
client binds to. To bind to a different address, use the
<br>
*ListenAddress and OutboundBindAddress options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AllowSingleHopExits 0|1 <br>
This option controls whether clients can use this server as
a single hop proxy. If set to 1, clients can use this server
as an exit even if it is the only hop in the circuit. <br>
Note that most clients will refuse to use servers that set
this option, since most clients have ExcludeSingleHopRelays
set. (Default: 0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AssumeReachable 0|1 <br>
This option is used when bootstrapping a new Tor network. If
set to 1, don&acirc;t do self-reachability testing; just
upload your server descriptor immediately. If <br>
AuthoritativeDirectory is also set, this option instructs
the dirserver to bypass remote reachability testing too and
list all connected servers as running.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BridgeRelay 0|1 <br>
Sets the relay to act as a &quot;bridge&quot; with respect
to relaying connections from bridge users to the Tor
network. It mainly causes Tor to publish a server descriptor
to the <br>
bridge database, rather than to the public directory
authorities.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ContactInfo email_address <br>
Administrative contact information for this relay or bridge.
This line can be used to contact you if your relay or bridge
is misconfigured or something else goes wrong. Note <br>
that we archive and publish all descriptors containing these
lines and that Google indexes them, so spammers might also
collect them. You may want to obscure the fact that <br>
it&acirc;s an email address and/or generate a new address
for this purpose.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ExitRelay 0|1|auto <br>
Tells Tor whether to run as an exit relay. If Tor is running
as a non-bridge server, and ExitRelay is set to 1, then Tor
allows traffic to exit according to the ExitPolicy <br>
option (or the default ExitPolicy if none is specified).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If ExitRelay is set to 0, no
traffic is allowed to exit, and the ExitPolicy option is
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If ExitRelay is set to
&quot;auto&quot;, then Tor behaves as if it were set to 1,
but warns the user if this would cause traffic to exit. In a
future version, the default value will be <br>
0. (Default: auto)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ExitPolicy policy,policy,...
<br>
Set an exit policy for this server. Each policy is of the
form &quot;accept[6]|reject[6] ADDR[/MASK][:PORT]&quot;. If
/MASK is omitted then this policy just applies to the host
given. <br>
Instead of giving a host or network you can also use
&quot;*&quot; to denote the universe (0.0.0.0/0 and ::/128),
or *4 to denote all IPv4 addresses, and *6 to denote all
IPv6 <br>
addresses. PORT can be a single port number, an interval of
ports &quot;FROM_PORT-TO_PORT&quot;, or &quot;*&quot;. If
PORT is omitted, that means &quot;*&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, &quot;accept
18.7.22.69:*,reject 18.0.0.0/8:*,accept *:*&quot; would
reject any IPv4 traffic destined for MIT except for
web.mit.edu, and accept any other IPv4 or IPv6 <br>
traffic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tor also allows IPv6 exit policy
entries. For instance, &quot;reject6 [FC00::]/7:*&quot;
rejects all destinations that share 7 most significant bit
prefix with address FC00::. <br>
Respectively, &quot;accept6 [C000::]/3:*&quot; accepts all
destinations that share 3 most significant bit prefix with
address C000::.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">accept6 and reject6 only produce
IPv6 exit policy entries. Using an IPv4 address with accept6
or reject6 is ignored and generates a warning. accept/reject
allows either IPv4 <br>
or IPv6 addresses. Use *4 as an IPv4 wildcard address, and
*6 as an IPv6 wildcard address. accept/reject * expands to
matching IPv4 and IPv6 wildcard address rules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To specify all IPv4 and IPv6
internal and link-local networks (including 0.0.0.0/8,
169.254.0.0/16, 127.0.0.0/8, 192.168.0.0/16, 10.0.0.0/8,
172.16.0.0/12, [::]/8, <br>
[FC00::]/7, [FE80::]/10, [FEC0::]/10, [FF00::]/8, and
[::]/127), you can use the &quot;private&quot; alias instead
of an address. (&quot;private&quot; always produces rules
for IPv4 and IPv6 <br>
addresses, even when used with accept6/reject6.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Private addresses are rejected
by default (at the beginning of your exit policy), along
with any configured primary public IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
These private addresses <br>
are rejected unless you set the ExitPolicyRejectPrivate
config option to 0. For example, once you&acirc;ve done
that, you could allow HTTP to 127.0.0.1 and block all other
<br>
connections to internal networks with &quot;accept
127.0.0.1:80,reject private:*&quot;, though that may also
allow connections to your own computer that are addressed to
its public <br>
(external) IP address. See RFC 1918 and RFC 3330 for more
details about internal and reserved IP address space. See
ExitPolicyRejectLocalInterfaces if you want to block every
<br>
address on the relay, even those that aren&acirc;t
advertised in the descriptor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This directive can be specified
multiple times so you don&acirc;t have to put it all on one
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Policies are considered first to
last, and the first match wins. If you want to allow the
same ports on IPv4 and IPv6, write your rules using
accept/reject *. If you want to <br>
allow different ports on IPv4 and IPv6, write your IPv6
rules using accept6/reject6 *6, and your IPv4 rules using
accept/reject *4. If you want to _replace_ the default exit
<br>
policy, end your exit policy with either a reject *:* or an
accept *:*. Otherwise, you&acirc;re _augmenting_ (prepending
to) the default exit policy. The default exit policy is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reject *:25 <br>
reject *:119 <br>
reject *:135-139 <br>
reject *:445 <br>
reject *:563 <br>
reject *:1214 <br>
reject *:4661-4666 <br>
reject *:6346-6429 <br>
reject *:6699 <br>
reject *:6881-6999 <br>
accept *:*</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since the default exit policy
uses accept/reject *, it applies to both <br>
IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ExitPolicyRejectPrivate 0|1 <br>
Reject all private (local) networks, along with the
relay&acirc;s advertised public IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, at
the beginning of your exit policy. See above entry on
ExitPolicy. <br>
(Default: 1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ExitPolicyRejectLocalInterfaces
0|1 <br>
Reject all IPv4 and IPv6 addresses that the relay knows
about, at the beginning of your exit policy. This includes
any OutboundBindAddress, the bind addresses of any port <br>
options, such as ControlPort or DNSPort, and any public IPv4
and IPv6 addresses on any interface on the relay. (If
IPv6Exit is not set, all IPv6 addresses will be rejected
<br>
anyway.) See above entry on ExitPolicy. This option is off
by default, because it lists all public relay IP addresses
in the ExitPolicy, even those relay operators might <br>
prefer not to disclose. (Default: 0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IPv6Exit 0|1 <br>
If set, and we are an exit node, allow clients to use us for
IPv6 traffic. (Default: 0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MaxOnionQueueDelay NUM
[msec|second] <br>
If we have more onionskins queued for processing than we can
process in this amount of time, reject new ones. (Default:
1750 msec)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MyFamily node,node,... <br>
Declare that this Tor server is controlled or administered
by a group or organization identical or similar to that of
the other servers, defined by their identity <br>
fingerprints. When two servers both declare that they are in
the same &rsquo;family&rsquo;, Tor clients will not use them
in the same circuit. (Each server only needs to list the
other <br>
servers in its family; it doesn&acirc;t need to list itself,
but it won&acirc;t hurt.) Do not list any bridge relay as it
would compromise its concealment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When listing a node, it&acirc;s
better to list it by fingerprint than by nickname:
fingerprints are more reliable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Nickname name <br>
Set the server&acirc;s nickname to &rsquo;name&rsquo;.
Nicknames must be between 1 and 19 characters inclusive, and
must contain only the characters [a-zA-Z0-9].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NumCPUs num <br>
How many processes to use at once for decrypting onionskins
and other parallelizable operations. If this is set to 0,
Tor will try to detect how many CPUs you have, <br>
defaulting to 1 if it can&acirc;t tell. (Default: 0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ORPort [address:]PORT|auto
[flags] <br>
Advertise this port to listen for connections from Tor
clients and servers. This option is required to be a Tor
server. Set it to &quot;auto&quot; to have Tor pick a port
for you. Set <br>
it to 0 to not run an ORPort at all. This option can occur
more than once. (Default: 0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tor recognizes these flags on
each ORPort: <br>
**NoAdvertise**:: <br>
By default, we bind to a port and tell our users about it.
If <br>
NoAdvertise is specified, we don&rsquo;t advertise, but
listen anyway. This <br>
can be useful if the port everybody will be connecting to
(for <br>
example, one that&rsquo;s opened on our firewall) is
somewhere else. <br>
**NoListen**:: <br>
By default, we bind to a port and tell our users about it.
If <br>
NoListen is specified, we don&rsquo;t bind, but advertise
anyway. This <br>
can be useful if something else (for example, a
firewall&rsquo;s port <br>
forwarding configuration) is causing connections to reach
us. <br>
**IPv4Only**:: <br>
If the address is absent, or resolves to both an IPv4 and an
IPv6 <br>
address, only listen to the IPv4 address. <br>
**IPv6Only**:: <br>
If the address is absent, or resolves to both an IPv4 and an
IPv6 <br>
address, only listen to the IPv6 address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For obvious reasons, NoAdvertise
and NoListen are mutually exclusive, and <br>
IPv4Only and IPv6Only are mutually exclusive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ORListenAddress IP[:PORT] <br>
Bind to this IP address to listen for connections from Tor
clients and servers. If you specify a port, bind to this
port rather than the one specified in ORPort. (Default: <br>
0.0.0.0) This directive can be specified multiple times to
bind to multiple addresses/ports.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is deprecated; you
can get the same behavior with ORPort now <br>
that it supports NoAdvertise and explicit addresses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PortForwarding 0|1 <br>
Attempt to automatically forward the DirPort and ORPort on a
NAT router connecting this Tor server to the Internet. If
set, Tor will try both NAT-PMP (common on Apple <br>
routers) and UPnP (common on routers from other
manufacturers). (Default: 0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PortForwardingHelper
filename|pathname <br>
If PortForwarding is set, use this executable to configure
the forwarding. If set to a filename, the system path will
be searched for the executable. If set to a path, only <br>
the specified path will be executed. (Default:
tor-fw-helper)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PublishServerDescriptor
0|1|v3|bridge,... <br>
This option specifies which descriptors Tor will publish
when acting as a relay. You can choose multiple arguments,
separated by commas.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option is set to 0, Tor
will not publish its descriptors to any directories. (This
is useful if you&acirc;re testing out your server, or if
you&acirc;re using a Tor controller <br>
that handles directory publishing for you.) Otherwise, Tor
will publish its descriptors of all type(s) specified. The
default is &quot;1&quot;, which means &quot;if running as a
server, <br>
publish the appropriate descriptors to the
authorities&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ShutdownWaitLength NUM <br>
When we get a SIGINT and we&acirc;re a server, we begin
shutting down: we close listeners and start refusing new
circuits. After NUM seconds, we exit. If we get a second
SIGINT, we <br>
exit immediately. (Default: 30 seconds)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SSLKeyLifetime N
minutes|hours|days|weeks <br>
When creating a link certificate for our outermost SSL
handshake, set its lifetime to this amount of time. If set
to 0, Tor will choose some reasonable random defaults. <br>
(Default: 0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HeartbeatPeriod N
minutes|hours|days|weeks <br>
Log a heartbeat message every HeartbeatPeriod seconds. This
is a log level notice message, designed to let you know your
Tor server is still alive and doing useful things. <br>
Settings this to 0 will disable the heartbeat. Otherwise, it
must be at least 30 minutes. (Default: 6 hours)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AccountingMax N
bytes|KBytes|MBytes|GBytes|KBits|MBits|GBits|TBytes <br>
Limits the max number of bytes sent and received within a
set time period using a given calculation rule (see:
AccountingStart, AccountingRule). Useful if you need to stay
<br>
under a specific bandwidth. By default, the number used for
calculation is the max of either the bytes sent or received.
For example, with AccountingMax set to 1 GByte, a <br>
server could send 900 MBytes and receive 800 MBytes and
continue running. It will only hibernate once one of the two
reaches 1 GByte. This can be changed to use the sum of <br>
the both bytes received and sent by setting the
AccountingRule option to &quot;sum&quot; (total bandwidth
in/out). When the number of bytes remaining gets low, Tor
will stop accepting <br>
new connections and circuits. When the number of bytes is
exhausted, Tor will hibernate until some time in the next
accounting period. To prevent all servers from waking at
<br>
the same time, Tor will also wait until a random point in
each period before waking up. If you have bandwidth cost
issues, enabling hibernation is preferable to setting a low
<br>
bandwidth, since it provides users with a collection of fast
servers that are up some of the time, which is more useful
than a set of slow servers that are always <br>
&quot;available&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AccountingRule sum|max|in|out
<br>
How we determine when our AccountingMax has been reached
(when we should hibernate) during a time interval. Set to
&quot;max&quot; to calculate using the higher of either the
sent or <br>
received bytes (this is the default functionality). Set to
&quot;sum&quot; to calculate using the sent plus received
bytes. Set to &quot;in&quot; to calculate using only the
received bytes. Set <br>
to &quot;out&quot; to calculate using only the sent bytes.
(Default: max)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AccountingStart day|week|month
[day] HH:MM <br>
Specify how long accounting periods last. If month is given,
each accounting period runs from the time HH:MM on the dayth
day of one month to the same day and time of the <br>
next. (The day must be between 1 and 28.) If week is given,
each accounting period runs from the time HH:MM of the dayth
day of one week to the same day and time of the next <br>
week, with Monday as day 1 and Sunday as day 7. If day is
given, each accounting period runs from the time HH:MM each
day to the same time on the next day. All times are <br>
local, and given in 24-hour time. (Default: &quot;month 1
0:00&quot;)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RefuseUnknownExits 0|1|auto <br>
Prevent nodes that don&acirc;t appear in the consensus from
exiting using this relay. If the option is 1, we always
block exit attempts from such nodes; if it&acirc;s 0, we
never do, and <br>
if the option is &quot;auto&quot;, then we do whatever the
authorities suggest in the consensus (and block if the
consensus is quiet on the issue). (Default: auto)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ServerDNSResolvConfFile filename
<br>
Overrides the default DNS configuration with the
configuration in filename. The file format is the same as
the standard Unix &quot;resolv.conf&quot; file (7). This
option, like all <br>
other ServerDNS options, only affects name lookups that your
server does on behalf of clients. (Defaults to use the
system DNS configuration.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ServerDNSAllowBrokenConfig 0|1
<br>
If this option is false, Tor exits immediately if there are
problems parsing the system DNS configuration or connecting
to nameservers. Otherwise, Tor continues to <br>
periodically retry the system nameservers until it
eventually succeeds. (Default: 1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ServerDNSSearchDomains 0|1 <br>
If set to 1, then we will search for addresses in the local
search domain. For example, if this system is configured to
believe it is in &quot;example.com&quot;, and a client tries
to <br>
connect to &quot;www&quot;, the client will be connected to
&quot;www.example.com&quot;. This option only affects name
lookups that your server does on behalf of clients.
(Default: 0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ServerDNSDetectHijacking 0|1
<br>
When this option is set to 1, we will test periodically to
determine whether our local nameservers have been configured
to hijack failing DNS requests (usually to an <br>
advertising site). If they are, we will attempt to correct
this. This option only affects name lookups that your server
does on behalf of clients. (Default: 1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ServerDNSTestAddresses
address,address,... <br>
When we&acirc;re detecting DNS hijacking, make sure that
these valid addresses aren&acirc;t getting redirected. If
they are, then our DNS is completely useless, and
we&acirc;ll reset our exit <br>
policy to &quot;reject *:*&quot;. This option only affects
name lookups that your server does on behalf of clients.
(Default: &quot;www.google.com, www.mit.edu, www.yahoo.com,
<br>
www.slashdot.org&quot;)</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">ServerDNSAllowNonRFC953Hostnames
0|1 <br>
When this option is disabled, Tor does not try to resolve
hostnames containing illegal characters (like @ and :)
rather than sending them to an exit node to be resolved.
This <br>
helps trap accidental attempts to resolve URLs and so on.
This option only affects name lookups that your server does
on behalf of clients. (Default: 0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BridgeRecordUsageByCountry 0|1
<br>
When this option is enabled and BridgeRelay is also enabled,
and we have GeoIP data, Tor keeps a per-country count of how
many client addresses have contacted it so that it <br>
can help the bridge authority guess which countries have
blocked access to it. (Default: 1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ServerDNSRandomizeCase 0|1 <br>
When this option is set, Tor sets the case of each character
randomly in outgoing DNS requests, and makes sure that the
case matches in DNS replies. This so-called &quot;0x20 <br>
hack&quot; helps resist some types of DNS poisoning attack.
For more information, see &quot;Increased DNS Forgery
Resistance through 0x20-Bit Encoding&quot;. This option only
affects name <br>
lookups that your server does on behalf of clients.
(Default: 1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GeoIPFile filename <br>
A filename containing IPv4 GeoIP data, for use with
by-country statistics.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GeoIPv6File filename <br>
A filename containing IPv6 GeoIP data, for use with
by-country statistics.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TLSECGroup P224|P256 <br>
What EC group should we try to use for incoming TLS
connections? P224 is faster, but makes us stand out more.
Has no effect if we&acirc;re a client, or if our OpenSSL
version lacks <br>
support for ECDHE. (Default: P256)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CellStatistics 0|1 <br>
Relays only. When this option is enabled, Tor collects
statistics about cell processing (i.e. mean time a cell is
spending in a queue, mean number of cells in a queue and
<br>
mean number of processed cells per circuit) and writes them
into disk every 24 hours. Onion router operators may use the
statistics for performance monitoring. If <br>
ExtraInfoStatistics is enabled, it will published as part of
extra-info document. (Default: 0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DirReqStatistics 0|1 <br>
Relays and bridges only. When this option is enabled, a Tor
directory writes statistics on the number and response time
of network status requests to disk every 24 hours. <br>
Enables relay and bridge operators to monitor how much their
server is being used by clients to learn about Tor network.
If ExtraInfoStatistics is enabled, it will published <br>
as part of extra-info document. (Default: 1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EntryStatistics 0|1 <br>
Relays only. When this option is enabled, Tor writes
statistics on the number of directly connecting clients to
disk every 24 hours. Enables relay operators to monitor how
<br>
much inbound traffic that originates from Tor clients passes
through their server to go further down the Tor network. If
ExtraInfoStatistics is enabled, it will be published <br>
as part of extra-info document. (Default: 0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ExitPortStatistics 0|1 <br>
Exit relays only. When this option is enabled, Tor writes
statistics on the number of relayed bytes and opened stream
per exit port to disk every 24 hours. Enables exit relay
<br>
operators to measure and monitor amounts of traffic that
leaves Tor network through their exit node. If
ExtraInfoStatistics is enabled, it will be published as part
of <br>
extra-info document. (Default: 0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ConnDirectionStatistics 0|1 <br>
Relays only. When this option is enabled, Tor writes
statistics on the amounts of traffic it passes between
itself and other relays to disk every 24 hours. Enables
relay <br>
operators to monitor how much their relay is being used as
middle node in the circuit. If ExtraInfoStatistics is
enabled, it will be published as part of extra-info
document. <br>
(Default: 0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HiddenServiceStatistics 0|1 <br>
Relays only. When this option is enabled, a Tor relay writes
obfuscated statistics on its role as hidden-service
directory, introduction point, or rendezvous point to disk
<br>
every 24 hours. If ExtraInfoStatistics is also enabled,
these statistics are further published to the directory
authorities. (Default: 1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ExtraInfoStatistics 0|1 <br>
When this option is enabled, Tor includes previously
gathered statistics in its extra-info documents that it
uploads to the directory authorities. (Default: 1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ExtendAllowPrivateAddresses 0|1
<br>
When this option is enabled, Tor will connect to relays on
localhost, RFC1918 addresses, and so on. In particular, Tor
will make direct OR connections, and Tor routers allow <br>
EXTEND requests, to these private addresses. (Tor will
always allow connections to bridges, proxies, and pluggable
transports configured on private addresses.) Enabling this
<br>
option can create security issues; you should probably leave
it off. (Default: 0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MaxMemInQueues N bytes|KB|MB|GB
<br>
This option configures a threshold above which Tor will
assume that it needs to stop queueing or buffering data
because it&acirc;s about to run out of memory. If it hits
this <br>
threshold, it will begin killing circuits until it has
recovered at least 10% of this memory. Do not set this
option too low, or your relay may be unreliable under load.
This <br>
option only affects some queues, so the actual process size
will be larger than this. If this option is set to 0, Tor
will try to pick a reasonable default based on your <br>
system&acirc;s physical memory. (Default: 0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DisableOOSCheck 0|1 <br>
This option disables the code that closes connections when
Tor notices that it is running low on sockets. Right now, it
is on by default, since the existing out-of-sockets <br>
mechanism tends to kill OR connections more than it should.
(Default: 1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SigningKeyLifetime N
days|weeks|months <br>
For how long should each Ed25519 signing key be valid? Tor
uses a permanent master identity key that can be kept
offline, and periodically generates new &quot;signing&quot;
keys that <br>
it uses online. This option configures their lifetime.
(Default: 30 days)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OfflineMasterKey 0|1 <br>
If non-zero, the Tor relay will never generate or load its
master secret key. Instead, you&acirc;ll have to use
&quot;tor --keygen&quot; to manage the permanent ed25519
master identity key, <br>
as well as the corresponding temporary signing keys and
certificates. (Default: 0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIRECTORY SERVER OPTIONS <br>
The following options are useful only for directory servers
(that is, if DirPort is non-zero):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DirPortFrontPage FILENAME <br>
When this option is set, it takes an HTML file and publishes
it as &quot;/&quot; on the DirPort. Now relay operators can
provide a disclaimer without needing to set up a separate
<br>
webserver. There&acirc;s a sample disclaimer in
contrib/operator-tools/tor-exit-notice.html.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DirPort [address:]PORT|auto
[flags] <br>
If this option is nonzero, advertise the directory service
on this port. Set it to &quot;auto&quot; to have Tor pick a
port for you. This option can occur more than once, but only
one <br>
advertised DirPort is supported: all but one DirPort must
have the NoAdvertise flag set. (Default: 0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The same flags are supported
here as are supported by ORPort.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DirListenAddress IP[:PORT] <br>
Bind the directory service to this address. If you specify a
port, bind to this port rather than the one specified in
DirPort. (Default: 0.0.0.0) This directive can be <br>
specified multiple times to bind to multiple
addresses/ports.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is deprecated; you
can get the same behavior with DirPort now <br>
that it supports NoAdvertise and explicit addresses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DirPolicy policy,policy,... <br>
Set an entrance policy for this server, to limit who can
connect to the directory ports. The policies have the same
form as exit policies above, except that port specifiers
<br>
are ignored. Any address not matched by some entry in the
policy is accepted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DirCache 0|1 <br>
When this option is set, Tor caches all current directory
documents and accepts client requests for them. Setting
DirPort is not required for this, because clients connect
<br>
via the ORPort by default. Setting either DirPort or
BridgeRelay and setting DirCache to 0 is not supported.
(Default: 1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIRECTORY AUTHORITY SERVER
OPTIONS <br>
The following options enable operation as a directory
authority, and control how Tor behaves as a directory
authority. You should not need to adjust any of them if
you&acirc;re running <br>
a regular relay or exit server on the public Tor
network.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AuthoritativeDirectory 0|1 <br>
When this option is set to 1, Tor operates as an
authoritative directory server. Instead of caching the
directory, it generates its own list of good servers, signs
it, and <br>
sends that to the clients. Unless the clients already have
you listed as a trusted directory, you probably do not want
to set this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">V3AuthoritativeDirectory 0|1
<br>
When this option is set in addition to
AuthoritativeDirectory, Tor generates version 3 network
statuses and serves descriptors, etc as described in
dir-spec.txt file of <br>
torspec (for Tor clients and servers running at least
0.2.0.x).</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">VersioningAuthoritativeDirectory
0|1 <br>
When this option is set to 1, Tor adds information on which
versions of Tor are still believed safe for use to the
published directory. Each version 1 authority is <br>
automatically a versioning authority; version 2 authorities
provide this service optionally. See RecommendedVersions,
RecommendedClientVersions, and <br>
RecommendedServerVersions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RecommendedVersions STRING <br>
STRING is a comma-separated list of Tor versions currently
believed to be safe. The list is included in each directory,
and nodes which pull down the directory learn whether <br>
they need to upgrade. This option can appear multiple times:
the values from multiple lines are spliced together. When
this is set then VersioningAuthoritativeDirectory <br>
should be set too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RecommendedPackages PACKAGENAME
VERSION URL DIGESTTYPE=DIGEST <br>
Adds &quot;package&quot; line to the directory
authority&acirc;s vote. This information is used to vote on
the correct URL and digest for the released versions of
different Tor-related <br>
packages, so that the consensus can certify them. This line
may appear any number of times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RecommendedClientVersions STRING
<br>
STRING is a comma-separated list of Tor versions currently
believed to be safe for clients to use. This information is
included in version 2 directories. If this is not set <br>
then the value of RecommendedVersions is used. When this is
set then VersioningAuthoritativeDirectory should be set
too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BridgeAuthoritativeDir 0|1 <br>
When this option is set in addition to
AuthoritativeDirectory, Tor accepts and serves server
descriptors, but it caches and serves the main networkstatus
documents rather <br>
than generating its own. (Default: 0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MinUptimeHidServDirectoryV2 N
seconds|minutes|hours|days|weeks <br>
Minimum uptime of a v2 hidden service directory to be
accepted as such by authoritative directories. (Default: 25
hours)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RecommendedServerVersions STRING
<br>
STRING is a comma-separated list of Tor versions currently
believed to be safe for servers to use. This information is
included in version 2 directories. If this is not set <br>
then the value of RecommendedVersions is used. When this is
set then VersioningAuthoritativeDirectory should be set
too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ConsensusParams STRING <br>
STRING is a space-separated list of key=value pairs that Tor
will include in the &quot;params&quot; line of its
networkstatus vote.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DirAllowPrivateAddresses 0|1
<br>
If set to 1, Tor will accept server descriptors with
arbitrary &quot;Address&quot; elements. Otherwise, if the
address is not an IP address or is a private IP address, it
will reject <br>
the server descriptor. Additionally, Tor will allow exit
policies for private networks to fulfill Exit flag
requirements. (Default: 0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AuthDirBadExit AddressPattern...
<br>
Authoritative directories only. A set of address patterns
for servers that will be listed as bad exits in any network
status document this authority publishes, if <br>
AuthDirListBadExits is set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(The address pattern syntax here
and in the options below is the same as for exit policies,
except that you don&acirc;t need to say &quot;accept&quot;
or &quot;reject&quot;, and ports are not needed.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AuthDirInvalid AddressPattern...
<br>
Authoritative directories only. A set of address patterns
for servers that will never be listed as &quot;valid&quot;
in any network status document that this authority
publishes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AuthDirReject AddressPattern...
<br>
Authoritative directories only. A set of address patterns
for servers that will never be listed at all in any network
status document that this authority publishes, or <br>
accepted as an OR address in any descriptor submitted for
publication by this authority.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AuthDirBadExitCCs CC,...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AuthDirInvalidCCs CC,...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AuthDirRejectCCs CC,... <br>
Authoritative directories only. These options contain a
comma-separated list of country codes such that any server
in one of those country codes will be marked as a bad <br>
exit/invalid for use, or rejected entirely.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AuthDirListBadExits 0|1 <br>
Authoritative directories only. If set to 1, this directory
has some opinion about which nodes are unsuitable as exit
nodes. (Do not set this to 1 unless you plan to list <br>
non-functioning exits as bad; otherwise, you are effectively
voting in favor of every declared exit as an exit.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AuthDirMaxServersPerAddr NUM
<br>
Authoritative directories only. The maximum number of
servers that we will list as acceptable on a single IP
address. Set this to &quot;0&quot; for &quot;no limit&quot;.
(Default: 2)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AuthDirMaxServersPerAuthAddr NUM
<br>
Authoritative directories only. Like
AuthDirMaxServersPerAddr, but applies to addresses shared
with directory authorities. (Default: 5)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AuthDirFastGuarantee N
bytes|KBytes|MBytes|GBytes|KBits|MBits|GBits <br>
Authoritative directories only. If non-zero, always vote the
Fast flag for any relay advertising this amount of capacity
or more. (Default: 100 KBytes)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AuthDirGuardBWGuarantee N
bytes|KBytes|MBytes|GBytes|KBits|MBits|GBits <br>
Authoritative directories only. If non-zero, this advertised
capacity or more is always sufficient to satisfy the
bandwidth requirement for the Guard flag. (Default: 250 <br>
KBytes)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AuthDirPinKeys 0|1 <br>
Authoritative directories only. If non-zero, do not allow
any relay to publish a descriptor if any other relay has
reserved its &lt;Ed25519,RSA&gt; identity keypair. In all
cases, <br>
Tor records every keypair it accepts in a journal if it is
new, or if it differs from the most recently accepted
pinning for one of the keys it contains. (Default: 0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AuthDirSharedRandomness 0|1 <br>
Authoritative directories only. Switch for the shared random
protocol. If zero, the authority won&acirc;t participate in
the protocol. If non-zero (default), the flag <br>
&quot;shared-rand-participate&quot; is added to the
authority vote indicating participation in the protocol.
(Default: 1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BridgePassword Password <br>
If set, contains an HTTP authenticator that tells a bridge
authority to serve all requested bridge information. Used by
the (only partially implemented) &quot;bridge
community&quot; <br>
design, where a community of bridge relay operators all use
an alternate bridge directory authority, and their target
user audience can periodically fetch the list of <br>
available community bridges to stay up-to-date. (Default:
not set)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">V3AuthVotingInterval N
minutes|hours <br>
V3 authoritative directories only. Configures the
server&acirc;s preferred voting interval. Note that voting
will actually happen at an interval chosen by consensus from
all the <br>
authorities&rsquo; preferred intervals. This time SHOULD
divide evenly into a day. (Default: 1 hour)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">V3AuthVoteDelay N minutes|hours
<br>
V3 authoritative directories only. Configures the
server&acirc;s preferred delay between publishing its vote
and assuming it has all the votes from all the other
authorities. Note <br>
that the actual time used is not the server&acirc;s
preferred time, but the consensus of all preferences.
(Default: 5 minutes)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">V3AuthDistDelay N minutes|hours
<br>
V3 authoritative directories only. Configures the
server&acirc;s preferred delay between publishing its
consensus and signature and assuming it has all the
signatures from all the <br>
other authorities. Note that the actual time used is not the
server&acirc;s preferred time, but the consensus of all
preferences. (Default: 5 minutes)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">V3AuthNIntervalsValid NUM <br>
V3 authoritative directories only. Configures the number of
VotingIntervals for which each consensus should be valid
for. Choosing high numbers increases network partitioning
<br>
risks; choosing low numbers increases directory traffic.
Note that the actual number of intervals used is not the
server&acirc;s preferred number, but the consensus of all
<br>
preferences. Must be at least 2. (Default: 3)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">V3BandwidthsFile FILENAME <br>
V3 authoritative directories only. Configures the location
of the bandwidth-authority generated file storing
information on relays&rsquo; measured bandwidth capacities.
(Default: <br>
unset)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">V3AuthUseLegacyKey 0|1 <br>
If set, the directory authority will sign consensuses not
only with its own signing key, but also with a
&quot;legacy&quot; key and certificate with a different
identity. This feature <br>
is used to migrate directory authority keys in the event of
a compromise. (Default: 0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RephistTrackTime N
seconds|minutes|hours|days|weeks <br>
Tells an authority, or other node tracking node reliability
and history, that fine-grained information about nodes can
be discarded when it hasn&acirc;t changed for a given amount
<br>
of time. (Default: 24 hours)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AuthDirHasIPv6Connectivity 0|1
<br>
Authoritative directories only. When set to 0, OR ports with
an IPv6 address are being accepted without reachability
testing. When set to 1, IPv6 OR ports are being tested <br>
just like IPv4 OR ports. (Default: 0)</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">MinMeasuredBWsForAuthToIgnoreAdvertised
N <br>
A total value, in abstract bandwidth units, describing how
much measured total bandwidth an authority should have
observed on the network before it will treat advertised <br>
bandwidths as wholly unreliable. (Default: 500)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HIDDEN SERVICE OPTIONS <br>
The following options are used to configure a hidden
service.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HiddenServiceDir DIRECTORY <br>
Store data files for a hidden service in DIRECTORY. Every
hidden service must have a separate directory. You may use
this option multiple times to specify multiple services.
<br>
DIRECTORY must be an existing directory. (Note: in current
versions of Tor, if DIRECTORY is a relative path, it will be
relative to current working directory of Tor instance, <br>
not to its DataDirectory. Do not rely on this behavior; it
is not guaranteed to remain the same in future
versions.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HiddenServicePort VIRTPORT
[TARGET] <br>
Configure a virtual port VIRTPORT for a hidden service. You
may use this option multiple times; each time applies to the
service using the most recent HiddenServiceDir. By <br>
default, this option maps the virtual port to the same port
on 127.0.0.1 over TCP. You may override the target port,
address, or both by specifying a target of addr, port, <br>
addr:port, or unix:path. (You can specify an IPv6 target as
[addr]:port. Unix paths may be quoted, and may use standard
C escapes.) You may also have multiple lines with the <br>
same VIRTPORT: when a user connects to that VIRTPORT, one of
the TARGETs from those lines will be chosen at random.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PublishHidServDescriptors 0|1
<br>
If set to 0, Tor will run any hidden services you configure,
but it won&acirc;t advertise them to the rendezvous
directory. This option is only useful if you&acirc;re using
a Tor <br>
controller that handles hidserv publishing for you.
(Default: 1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HiddenServiceVersion
version,version,... <br>
A list of rendezvous service descriptor versions to publish
for the hidden service. Currently, only version 2 is
supported. (Default: 2)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HiddenServiceAuthorizeClient
auth-type client-name,client-name,... <br>
If configured, the hidden service is accessible for
authorized clients only. The auth-type can either be
&rsquo;basic&rsquo; for a general-purpose authorization
protocol or &rsquo;stealth&rsquo; for <br>
a less scalable protocol that also hides service activity
from unauthorized clients. Only clients that are listed here
are authorized to access the hidden service. Valid <br>
client names are 1 to 16 characters long and only use
characters in A-Za-z0-9+-_ (no spaces). If this option is
set, the hidden service is not accessible for clients
without <br>
authorization any more. Generated authorization data can be
found in the hostname file. Clients need to put this
authorization data in their configuration file using <br>
HidServAuth.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HiddenServiceAllowUnknownPorts
0|1 <br>
If set to 1, then connections to unrecognized ports do not
cause the current hidden service to close rendezvous
circuits. (Setting this to 0 is not an authorization <br>
mechanism; it is instead meant to be a mild inconvenience to
port-scanners.) (Default: 0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HiddenServiceMaxStreams N <br>
The maximum number of simultaneous streams (connections) per
rendezvous circuit. (Setting this to 0 will allow an
unlimited number of simultanous streams.) (Default: 0)</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">HiddenServiceMaxStreamsCloseCircuit
0|1 <br>
If set to 1, then exceeding HiddenServiceMaxStreams will
cause the offending rendezvous circuit to be torn down, as
opposed to stream creation requests that exceed the limit
<br>
being silently ignored. (Default: 0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RendPostPeriod N
seconds|minutes|hours|days|weeks <br>
Every time the specified period elapses, Tor uploads any
rendezvous service descriptors to the directory servers.
This information is also uploaded whenever it changes. <br>
(Default: 1 hour)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HiddenServiceDirGroupReadable
0|1 <br>
If this option is set to 1, allow the filesystem group to
read the hidden service directory and hostname file. If the
option is set to 0, only owner is able to read the <br>
hidden service directory. (Default: 0) Has no effect on
Windows.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">HiddenServiceNumIntroductionPoints
NUM <br>
Number of introduction points the hidden service will have.
You can&acirc;t have more than 10. (Default: 3)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HiddenServiceSingleHopMode 0|1
<br>
Experimental - Non Anonymous Hidden Services on a tor
instance in HiddenServiceSingleHopMode make one-hop (direct)
circuits between the onion service server, and the <br>
introduction and rendezvous points. (Onion service
descriptors are still posted using 3-hop paths, to avoid
onion service directories blocking the service.) This option
makes <br>
every hidden service instance hosted by a tor instance a
Single Onion Service. One-hop circuits make Single Onion
servers easily locatable, but clients remain <br>
location-anonymous. However, the fact that a client is
accessing a Single Onion rather than a Hidden Service may be
statistically distinguishable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">**WARNING:** Once a hidden
service directory has been used by a tor <br>
instance in HiddenServiceSingleHopMode, it can **NEVER** be
used again for <br>
a hidden service. It is best practice to create a new hidden
service <br>
directory, key, and address for each new Single Onion
Service and Hidden <br>
Service. It is not possible to run Single Onion Services and
Hidden <br>
Services from the same tor instance: they should be run on
different <br>
servers with different IP addresses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HiddenServiceSingleHopMode
requires HiddenServiceNonAnonymousMode to be set <br>
to 1. Since a Single Onion service is non-anonymous, you can
not configure <br>
a SOCKSPort on a tor instance that is running in <br>
**HiddenServiceSingleHopMode**. <br>
(Default: 0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HiddenServiceNonAnonymousMode
0|1 <br>
Makes hidden services non-anonymous on this tor instance.
Allows the non-anonymous HiddenServiceSingleHopMode. Enables

and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGINT <br>
Tor clients behave as with SIGTERM; but Tor servers will do
a controlled slow shutdown, closing listeners and waiting 30
seconds before exiting. (The delay can be configured <br>
with the ShutdownWaitLength config option.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGHUP <br>
The signal instructs Tor to reload its configuration
(including closing and reopening logs), and kill and restart
its helper processes if applicable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGUSR1 <br>
Log statistics about current connections, past connections,
and throughput.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGUSR2 <br>
Switch all logs to loglevel debug. You can go back to the
old loglevels by sending a SIGHUP.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGCHLD <br>
Tor receives this signal when one of its helper processes
has exited, so it can clean up.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGPIPE <br>
Tor catches this signal and ignores it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGXFSZ <br>
If this signal exists on your platform, Tor catches and
ignores it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>

not actually put it here.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">DataDirectory/keys/authority_certificate
<br>
A v3 directory authority&acirc;s certificate, which
authenticates the authority&acirc;s current vote- and

identity key. This key is used to sign the medium-term
ed25519 signing key. This file can be kept offline, or kept
encrypted. <br>
If so, Tor will not be able to generate new signing keys
itself; you&acirc;ll need to use tor --keygen yourself to do
so.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">DataDirectory/keys/ed25519_signing_secret_key
<br>
The private and public components of a relay&acirc;s
medium-term Ed25519 signing key. This key is authenticated
