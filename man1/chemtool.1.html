<b>chemtool</b> is a program for drawing organic molecules and exporting them as
  a X bitmap, PNG, PicTeX, Xfig, SVG, SXD, MDL or EPS file. It runs under the X
  Window System using the GTK widget set.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The program offers essentially unlimited undo/redo, two text fonts plus symbols,
  seven colors, drawing at several zoom scales, and square and hexagonal
  backdrop grids for easier alignment.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="EXAMPLES"><a class="selflink" href="#EXAMPLES">EXAMPLES</a></h1>
In all drawing and editing modes, mouse button one (usually the left button) is
  used to mark or draw objects, while button three (the right button) can be
  used to delete objects of the current type. The middle button is mainly used
  in the bond drawing modes where it allows fast changing of bondtypes. Starting
  with version 1.5, the default storage directory for datafiles, and the
  filename extension to use, can be saved via a configuration dialog.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Drawing_of_bonds:"><a class="selflink" href="#Drawing_of_bonds:">Drawing
  of bonds:</a></h2>
Bonds can be drawn in 4 different angle settings (hexagon with 30&#x00B0;
  intervals, two pentagons with 72&#x00B0; intervals (different orientation),
  and a 45&#x00B0; i octagon). (Intermediate angles are possible in all of these
  modes as well - just ignore the marker points in this case).
<div class="Pp"></div>
The bond style chooser in the center of the button bar determines the type of
  bond that is drawn - initially, this is a single bond. If you want to change
  the type of a bond later, either click on it with the middle button of your
  mouse to advance to the next type(s), or select the appropriate type in the
  chooser and then switch to bondtype mode and pick all bonds that you want to
  change over to the new type. (The color used for the bond is updated at the
  same time if necessary.) Pressing the middle mousebutton on a bond when in
  'Bondtype' mode reverses the direction of that bond.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Using the third (usually the right) mouse button deletes the bond next to the
  cursor position.

The available bond types are:

<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Semiautomatic_drawing_of_rings:"><a class="selflink" href="#Semiautomatic_drawing_of_rings:">Semiautomatic
  drawing of rings:</a></h2>
Rings of 3 to 12 members can be drawn easily by holding down the Ctrl key while
  drawing a line. This line will then become the first segment of a ring that is
  automatically drawn in clockwise direction. The size of the ring defaults to
  that appropriate for the selected drawing mode (i.e. 5, 6 or 8 sides), but it
  can be set on a per-ring basis by pressing Ctlr-&lt;number&gt; before drawing
  the ring, where numbers 3-9 correspond to 3 to 9-membered rings, while 0 to 2
  select 10, 11 and 12-membered rings, respectively.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Newly drawn rings can be deleted by pressing Ctrl and mouse button 3 together.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Drawing_of_curved_lines:"><a class="selflink" href="#Drawing_of_curved_lines:">Drawing
  of curved lines:</a></h2>
Curved lines for objects like arrows or orbital lobes can be drawn in spline
  curve mode by specifying four control points that form a bounding polygon
  (startpoint, two points on either side of the peak, endpoint). Of the regular
  bondtypes available in the Style menu, the 'single line', 'semiarrow', arrow
  and 'dashed line' retain their usual function, while the 'wide line' type is
  used to denote a filled polygon. The control points are only visible in
  <i>Move</i> mode, where they can be dragged around to change the form of a
  curve after it is drawn.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Setting_bond_style"><a class="selflink" href="#Setting_bond_style">Setting
  bond style</a></h2>
In bond style mode, clicking on any bond in the diagram changes its
  representation to the type selected in the pull-down menu next to the
  <i>Type</i> button.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The additional bond type available in the pulldown menu,
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">curved arrow</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
is only available for drawing. It is actually a shortcut for one of the curve
  drawing functions described above, with the second and third control points
  automatically generated. As such, it can not be converted to or from any of
  the conventional bond types.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
(One can, however, convert it to any of the other curve types, e.g. to change
  the type of arrowhead). The shape of the arrow will usually need to be
  adjusted by shifting the control point that appears alongside it in 'Move'
  mode.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Inserting_text"><a class="selflink" href="#Inserting_text">Inserting
  text</a></h2>
Text written into the text box can be positioned with the cursor and may appear
  left, middle or right-aligned in the drawing. Text size and color is
  selectable from a fixed list of choices. There are two special characters to
  be used for sub- and superscripting the following character:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 8.00ex;">'^' to shift up 	(e.g. N^+)
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
'_' to shift down	(e.g. CH_3)</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The control character '|' is used to italicise the following character, as in
  |t-Bu.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A bold fonttype, typically used for numbering compounds, can be selected by
  preceding the character with a '#'.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The special character '@' switches to symbol mode, which uses the standard X11
  symbol font. All alphabetic keys produce the corresponding Greek characters in
  this mode, and several other symbols are available if their standard Latin1
  equivalents are already mapped onto the keyboard:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 8.00ex;">yen -&gt; infinity
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
hyphen -&gt; uparrow
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
macron -&gt; downarrow</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The symbols 'plusminus' and 'registered' (trademark) are already in the standard
  font, although they are not normally available on the keyboard. Use the
  following commands (or add the declarations to your <i>.xmodmaprc</i> ) to
  make them available via &lt;AltGr&gt;+&lt;Key&gt;
  (&lt;RightAlt&gt;+&lt;Key&gt;):
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 8.00ex;">xmodmap -e 'keysym r = r R registered' \
<br/>
 -e 'keysym o = o O yen' \
<br/>
 -e 'keysym p = p P plusminus' \
<br/>
 -e 'keysym u = u U hyphen' \
<br/>
 -e 'keysym d = d D macron'</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
(this leads to AltGr-P = plusminus, AltGr-R = registered in normal mode and
  AltGr-O = infinity, AltGr-U = uparrow, AltGr-D = downarrow in symbol font).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
For 'dots-and-crosses' diagrams, the following mappings to the symbol font might
  be useful: acute -&gt; cross (e.g. keysym x = x X acute) middle dot -&gt;
  filled dot (e.g. keysym d = d D periodcentered) (using the degree sign for the
  open dot).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Circled versions of the plus and minus signs for denoting ionic charge are
  available as @+ and @- .
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
When you want to use symbols as sub- or superscripts, place the sub- or
  superscripting character before the '@' character, e.g. K_@a .
<div class="Pp"></div>
In text mode, the right mouse button deletes the label at the cursor position.
  Changing the size, font or color of a label can be done by left-clicking on it
  after choosing the desired combination of settings. When the text entry box
  above the drawing area is empty, only the settings are updated without
  changing the contents of the label, otherwise the label text is replaced as
  well. If you want to copy the text of an existing label to the text entry box,
  click on it with the middle mouse button.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Labeling_shortcuts"><a class="selflink" href="#Labeling_shortcuts">Labeling
  shortcuts</a></h2>
In all bond drawing modes, several keyboard shortcuts are available to add atom
  symbols without having to leave drawing mode. The label is placed at the
  current drawing position (the endpoint of the last line drawn, or the spot
  last clicked on).
<div class="Pp"></div>
The keys 'c','h','n','o','s','p' and 'r' insert the corresponding capital
  letter, 'l' (lowercase L) inserts 'Cl', while '1', '2', '3' insert CH,CH_2 and
  CH_3, respectively. The asterisk key (*) inserts a filled circle.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Pressing the space bar once allows you to enter arbitrary labels, which will be
  placed at the current position when you press the Return key.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Drawing_electron_pairs"><a class="selflink" href="#Drawing_electron_pairs">Drawing
  electron pairs</a></h2>
The keys of the numeric keypad can be used to draw short 'electron pair' lines
  next to an element symbol - if one imagines the element symbol to be sitting
  on the central '5' key, each key draws the appropriate electron pair for its
  position. When used together with the Shift key, two dots are drawn instead of
  a line - simply delete one of the dots again if you need an odd number of
  electrons.

<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Numbering_atoms"><a class="selflink" href="#Numbering_atoms">Numbering
  atoms</a></h2>
For quick numbering of the atoms in a molecule, switch to one of the text modes,
  hold down the Control key and pick each atom in succession with the left mouse
  button. Numbering starts at 1, and the sequence can be reset at any time by
  clicking the right mouse button. If you need to use your own numbering scheme,
  clicking the middle button (while still holding down the Control key) makes it
  pick up whatever number is in the text entry field.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Centering"><a class="selflink" href="#Centering">Centering</a></h2>
If there is not enough space for your molecule you can put it in the middle of
  the sheet with the center button.

<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Exporting_to_foreign_formats:"><a class="selflink" href="#Exporting_to_foreign_formats:">Exporting
  to foreign formats:</a></h2>
You can export your molecules as an X bitmap, a PNG or EMF image, an
  encapsulated postscript file, an input file for Brian Smith' <b>xfig</b>(1)
  program, an MDL ver. 2000 molfile for data exchange with commercial packages,
  an SVG file for XHTML web pages, or in the PicTeX format for direct inclusion
  in LaTeX documents. The PicTeX, PNG, EMF and Postscript output functions rely
  on the <b>fig2dev</b>81) program from the <b>transfig</b>(1) package and are
  only available when this program was detected on startup. If the
  <b>fig2sxd</b>(1) program is installed, an additional export option is
  available for OpenOffice SXD format. Likewise, if the (open)babel program is
  installed, an additional Export menu providing access to all filetypes
  supported by this tool becomes available.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can create the outputs in different sizes according to the current zoom
  scale. Postscript and PicTeX files can also be created at arbitrary scales
  selectable on the export file menu.
<div class="Pp"></div>
An option in the configuration menu can be set to call <b>fig2dev</b> in
  international language mode, which will automatically render any text written
  in the alternate (Times) font using the postscript font appropriate for the
  current locale (currently Croatian, Cyrillic, Czech, Hungarian, Japanese,
  Korean, Polish). See the <b>fig2dev</b> documentation for details.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To include the PicTeX-file in your LaTeX document, you will need the pictex
  macro package. Depending on the versions you use, you might also have to load
  the 'color' package in the preamble of your LaTeX file. If you experience 'TeX
  capacity exceeded' error messages, increase the extra_mem_bot parameter in
  your <i>texmf.cnf</i> file (usually in <i>/usr/share/texmf/web2c</i>,
  <i>/usr/local/texmf</i> or <i>/etc/texmf</i>). Pictex is known for its unusual
  (by tex standards) memory requirements, and the standard settings do not
  account for this (although you may find a comment a la 'change this if you use
  pictex' in the <i>texmf.cnf</i> file). Something like extra_mem_bot=400000
  should not hurt on any moderately modern system.

Since version 1.5, direct printing of diagrams to a Postscript-capable printing
  device (or more typically a print queue running ghostscript) is possible. The
  paper size, magnification, printer name and the print command to use
  (currently either <b>lp</b>(1), <b>lpr</b>(1) or <b>kprinter</b>(1)) can be
  stored in the Configuration Dialog.

The data in the template system differ from normal chemtool drawings only by the
  fact that they are stored within the program, and in a slightly awkward format
  (x and y coordinates listed separately in the source file templates.h). These
  are meant to provide a convenient basis set available to all users, but not
  individually extendable (you can use the 'Add' function for your own
  structures). Please let us know if you want specific molecules added to the
  templates - their name or ideally a regular chemtool drawing file is all we
  need. (send email to martin@ruby.chemie.uni-freiburg.de)

<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Importing_foreign_file_formats:"><a class="selflink" href="#Importing_foreign_file_formats:">Importing

Chemtool provides functions for importing files in both the PDB format used by
  the Protein Database (and by most molecular modeling packages) and the
  proprietary MDL molfile format used by ISISdraw and understood by other
  structure drawing packages and database frontends.
<div class="Pp"></div>
As both are 3D file formats, while chemtool only handles 2D projections,
  imported molecules are read into a temporary storage at first and displayed in
  blue on the canvas. This 3D representation can then be rotated using the
  mouse. Only after pressing the Return key on the keyboard is it converted into
  the final 2D projection that can be edited. While such a 3d import is in
  progress, all normal drawing and editing functions are disabled.
<div class="Pp"></div>
With MDL molfile import, the carbon atom labels are automatically discarded. For
  PDB import, the amount of labeling can be chosen in the file selection dialog,
  which offers retention of either all labels, only those of non-hydrogen atoms,
  or only the non-numeric part of the labels.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the program babel is installed - either the original version written by Pat
  Walters or the more recent OpenBabel effort - chemtool will automatically
  offer a menu option for importing from any of the file formats this supports.

The distribution contains a helper program, <b>cht</b>(1), by Radek Liboska
  (Prague) to calculate sum formula and (exact) molecular weight from a chemtool
  drawing file. It is also available from within chemtool to calculate these
  data for the current structure or a marked fragment of it. <b>cht</b> can be
  misled by duplicate bonds ( chemtool does not remove overlapping bonds, such
  as they might result from fusing ring systems, automatically) and by the
  'aromatic ring' symbol, so you should avoid these and check the plausibility
  of the generated sum formula where possible.

For features not currently supported by chemtool, like general line-drawing
  functions, getting Brian Smith's XFig drawing package <b>xfig</b> is highly
  recommended. About the only thing it does not offer is support for 'chemical'
  linetypes and drawing angles - which is why chemtool was written as a sort of
  companion program. (There will probably be more of the most sorely needed
  drawing options added to chemtool over time, but duplicating the more
  general-purpose features of <b>xfig</b> seems rather pointless.)
