<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
chemtool - chemical structures editor</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
chemtool [filename]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
chemtool is a program for drawing organic molecules and
exporting them as a X bitmap, PNG, PicTeX, Xfig, SVG, SXD,
MDL or EPS file. It runs under the X Window System using the
<br>
GTK widget set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The program offers essentially
unlimited undo/redo, two text fonts plus symbols, seven
colors, drawing at several zoom scales, and square and
hexagonal backdrop grids for easier <br>
alignment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
In all drawing and editing modes, mouse button one (usually
the left button) is used to mark or draw objects, while
button three (the right button) can be used to delete
objects <br>
of the current type. The middle button is mainly used in the
bond drawing modes where it allows fast changing of
bondtypes. Starting with version 1.5, the default storage
direc&acirc; <br>
tory for datafiles, and the filename extension to use, can
be saved via a configuration dialog.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Drawing of bonds: <br>
Bonds can be drawn in 4 different angle settings (hexagon
with 30&Acirc;&deg; intervals, two pentagons with
72&Acirc;&deg; intervals (different orientation), and a
45&Acirc;&deg; i octagon). (Intermediate angles <br>
are possible in all of these modes as well - just ignore the
marker points in this case).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The bond style chooser in the
center of the button bar determines the type of bond that is
drawn - initially, this is a single bond. If you want to
change the type of a bond <br>
later, either click on it with the middle button of your
mouse to advance to the next type(s), or select the
appropriate type in the chooser and then switch to bondtype
mode and <br>
pick all bonds that you want to change over to the new type.
(The color used for the bond is updated at the same time if
necessary.) Pressing the middle mousebutton on a bond <br>
when in &rsquo;Bondtype&rsquo; mode reverses the direction
of that bond.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using the third (usually the
right) mouse button deletes the bond next to the cursor
position.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The available bond types
are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; single bond</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; double bond</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; double bond
(shorter line on the other side)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; centered double
bond</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; triple bond
(flanking lines shorter than central)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; triple bond
(with equal line lengths)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; quadruple
bond</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; wedge-shaped
bond</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; dashed
wedge-shaped bond</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; wavy line</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; half arrow</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; regular
arrow</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; wide bond</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; circle</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; dotted line</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; overlapping
single bond (which cuts out a segment from any bond it
crosses)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; light pi orbital
lobe</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; dark pi orbital
lobe</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Semiautomatic drawing of rings:
<br>
Rings of 3 to 12 members can be drawn easily by holding down
the Ctrl key while drawing a line. This line will then
become the first segment of a ring that is automatically
drawn <br>
in clockwise direction. The size of the ring defaults to
that appropriate for the selected drawing mode (i.e. 5, 6 or
8 sides), but it can be set on a per-ring basis by pressing
<br>
Ctlr-&lt;number&gt; before drawing the ring, where numbers
3-9 correspond to 3 to 9-membered rings, while 0 to 2 select
10, 11 and 12-membered rings, respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Newly drawn rings can be deleted
by pressing Ctrl and mouse button 3 together.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Drawing of curved lines: <br>
Curved lines for objects like arrows or orbital lobes can be
drawn in spline curve mode by specifying four control points
that form a bounding polygon (startpoint, two points on <br>
either side of the peak, endpoint). Of the regular bondtypes
available in the Style menu, the &rsquo;single line&rsquo;,
&rsquo;semiarrow&rsquo;, arrow and &rsquo;dashed line&rsquo;
retain their usual function, <br>
while the &rsquo;wide line&rsquo; type is used to denote a
filled polygon. The control points are only visible in Move
mode, where they can be dragged around to change the form of
a curve <br>
after it is drawn.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Setting bond style <br>
In bond style mode, clicking on any bond in the diagram
changes its representation to the type selected in the
pull-down menu next to the Type button.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The additional bond type
available in the pulldown menu,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">curved arrow</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">is only available for drawing.
It is actually a shortcut for one of the curve drawing
functions described above, with the second and third control
points automatically generated. <br>
As such, it can not be converted to or from any of the
conventional bond types.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(One can, however, convert it to
any of the other curve types, e.g. to change the type of
arrowhead). The shape of the arrow will usually need to be
adjusted by shifting the con&acirc; <br>
trol point that appears alongside it in &rsquo;Move&rsquo;
mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Inserting text <br>
Text written into the text box can be positioned with the
cursor and may appear left, middle or right-aligned in the
drawing. Text size and color is selectable from a fixed list
<br>
of choices. There are two special characters to be used for
sub- and superscripting the following character:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&rsquo;^&rsquo; to shift up
(e.g. N^+)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&rsquo;_&rsquo; to shift down
(e.g. CH_3)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The control character
&rsquo;|&rsquo; is used to italicise the following
character, as in |t-Bu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A bold fonttype, typically used
for numbering compounds, can be selected by preceding the
character with a &rsquo;#&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The special character
&rsquo;@&rsquo; switches to symbol mode, which uses the
standard X11 symbol font. All alphabetic keys produce the
corresponding Greek characters in this mode, and sev&acirc;
<br>
eral other symbols are available if their standard Latin1
equivalents are already mapped onto the keyboard:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">yen -&gt; infinity</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hyphen -&gt; uparrow</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">macron -&gt; downarrow</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The symbols
&rsquo;plusminus&rsquo; and &rsquo;registered&rsquo;
(trademark) are already in the standard font, although they
are not normally available on the keyboard. Use the
following commands (or <br>
add the declarations to your .xmodmaprc ) to make them
available via &lt;AltGr&gt;+&lt;Key&gt;
(&lt;RightAlt&gt;+&lt;Key&gt;):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xmodmap -e &rsquo;keysym r = r R
registered&rsquo; -e &rsquo;keysym o = o O yen&rsquo; -e
&rsquo;keysym p = p P plusminus&rsquo; -e &rsquo;keysym u =
u U hyphen&rsquo; -e &rsquo;keysym d = d D macron&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(this leads to AltGr-P =
plusminus, AltGr-R = registered in normal mode and AltGr-O =
infinity, AltGr-U = uparrow, AltGr-D = downarrow in symbol
font).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For
&rsquo;dots-and-crosses&rsquo; diagrams, the following
mappings to the symbol font might be useful: acute -&gt;
cross (e.g. keysym x = x X acute) middle dot -&gt; filled
dot (e.g. keysym d = <br>
d D periodcentered) (using the degree sign for the open
dot).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Circled versions of the plus and
minus signs for denoting ionic charge are available as @+
and @- .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When you want to use symbols as
sub- or superscripts, place the sub- or superscripting
character before the &rsquo;@&rsquo; character, e.g. K_@a
.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In text mode, the right mouse
button deletes the label at the cursor position. Changing
the size, font or color of a label can be done by
left-clicking on it after choosing the <br>
desired combination of settings. When the text entry box
above the drawing area is empty, only the settings are
updated without changing the contents of the label,
otherwise the <br>
label text is replaced as well. If you want to copy the text
of an existing label to the text entry box, click on it with
the middle mouse button.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Labeling shortcuts <br>
In all bond drawing modes, several keyboard shortcuts are
available to add atom symbols without having to leave
drawing mode. The label is placed at the current drawing
position <br>
(the endpoint of the last line drawn, or the spot last
clicked on).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The keys
&rsquo;c&rsquo;,&rsquo;h&rsquo;,&rsquo;n&rsquo;,&rsquo;o&rsquo;,&rsquo;s&rsquo;,&rsquo;p&rsquo;
and &rsquo;r&rsquo; insert the corresponding capital letter,
&rsquo;l&rsquo; (lowercase L) inserts &rsquo;Cl&rsquo;,
while &rsquo;1&rsquo;, &rsquo;2&rsquo;, &rsquo;3&rsquo;
insert CH,CH_2 and CH_3, respectively. The <br>
asterisk key (*) inserts a filled circle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pressing the space bar once
allows you to enter arbitrary labels, which will be placed
at the current position when you press the Return key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Drawing electron pairs <br>
The keys of the numeric keypad can be used to draw short
&rsquo;electron pair&rsquo; lines next to an element symbol
- if one imagines the element symbol to be sitting on the
central &rsquo;5&rsquo; <br>
key, each key draws the appropriate electron pair for its
position. When used together with the Shift key, two dots
are drawn instead of a line - simply delete one of the dots
<br>
again if you need an odd number of electrons.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Numbering atoms <br>
For quick numbering of the atoms in a molecule, switch to
one of the text modes, hold down the Control key and pick
each atom in succession with the left mouse button.
Numbering <br>
starts at 1, and the sequence can be reset at any time by
clicking the right mouse button. If you need to use your own
numbering scheme, clicking the middle button (while still
<br>
holding down the Control key) makes it pick up whatever
number is in the text entry field.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Centering <br>
If there is not enough space for your molecule you can put
it in the middle of the sheet with the center button.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Exporting to foreign formats:
<br>
You can export your molecules as an X bitmap, a PNG or EMF
image, an encapsulated postscript file, an input file for
Brian Smith&rsquo; xfig(1) program, an MDL ver. 2000 molfile
for <br>
data exchange with commercial packages, an SVG file for
XHTML web pages, or in the PicTeX format for direct
inclusion in LaTeX documents. The PicTeX, PNG, EMF and
Postscript <br>
output functions rely on the fig2dev81) program from the
transfig(1) package and are only available when this program
was detected on startup. If the fig2sxd(1) program is <br>
installed, an additional export option is available for
OpenOffice SXD format. Likewise, if the (open)babel program
is installed, an additional Export menu providing access to
<br>
all filetypes supported by this tool becomes available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can create the outputs in
different sizes according to the current zoom scale.
Postscript and PicTeX files can also be created at arbitrary
scales selectable on the export <br>
file menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An option in the configuration
menu can be set to call fig2dev in international language
mode, which will automatically render any text written in
the alternate (Times) font <br>
using the postscript font appropriate for the current locale
(currently Croatian, Cyrillic, Czech, Hungarian, Japanese,
Korean, Polish). See the fig2dev documentation for <br>
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To include the PicTeX-file in
your LaTeX document, you will need the pictex macro package.
Depending on the versions you use, you might also have to
load the &rsquo;color&rsquo; package in <br>
the preamble of your LaTeX file. If you experience
&rsquo;TeX capacity exceeded&rsquo; error messages, increase
the extra_mem_bot parameter in your texmf.cnf file (usually
in <br>
/usr/share/texmf/web2c, /usr/local/texmf or /etc/texmf).
Pictex is known for its unusual (by tex standards) memory
requirements, and the standard settings do not account for
<br>
this (although you may find a comment a la &rsquo;change
this if you use pictex&rsquo; in the texmf.cnf file).
Something like extra_mem_bot=400000 should not hurt on any
moderately modern <br>
system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Printing drawings <br>
Since version 1.5, direct printing of diagrams to a
Postscript-capable printing device (or more typically a
print queue running ghostscript) is possible. The paper
size, magnifi&acirc; <br>
cation, printer name and the print command to use (currently
either lp(1), lpr(1) or kprinter(1)) can be stored in the
Configuration Dialog.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Selecting all or parts of a
drawing for transformations: <br>
Using the &rsquo;Mark&rsquo; button, you can easily select
parts of the current drawing by enclosing them with a
&rsquo;rubberband&rsquo; rectangle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you need to add atoms outside
of the rectangular area to your selection, simply draw
another rubberband around them while holding down the Ctrl
key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The selected parts will appear
highlighted in blue and are immediately available for</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">moving simply drag the fragment
to the desired position with the mouse while holding down
the left mouse button. (If you only need to move individual
atoms or bonds, you can <br>
simply pick and drag them in &rsquo;Move&rsquo; mode without
having to mark them first).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rotating horizontal movement of
the mouse translates to smooth rotation around the pivot
point selected when pressing the mouse button</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">flipping (mirroring) the
fragment about a horizontal or vertical mirror plane through
its center: this is performed by clicking on the appropriate
menu button</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">copying clicking on the
&rsquo;Copy&rsquo; menu button creates an exact copy of the
selected fragment slightly offset to the original. The mark
is automatically transferred to the new <br>
copy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rescaling horizontal mouse
movement is translated into a smooth increase or decrease of
size of the marked fragment</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">deleting to delete the marked
fragment, simply click the third (usually the right) mouse
button after it is highlighted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">framing choosing one of the
icons from the drop-down list of frame and bracket styles
draws the corresponding object, e.g. a pair of round
parentheses, around the highlighted <br>
fragment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">optimizing clicking on the
&rsquo;bucket and broom&rsquo; symbol invokes a function
that removes overlapping (duplicate) bonds and labels from
the drawing and straightens lines that are <br>
almost horizontal or vertical.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Adding previously saved figures:
<br>
To add another molecule from a previously saved chemtool
drawing, select it in the file selection window that comes
up when you press the &rsquo;Add&rsquo; button. Single
clicking on any <br>
filename in the list displays a small preview of the
molecule to aid in selection. The newly added molecule is
automatically made active so that it can be repositioned as
<br>
desired.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to add it to a
predefined position on another molecule, you can mark that
attachment site by left-clicking on it instead of dragging
the marker rectangle. A small <br>
green dot will appear at what is now the reference position
for the new part. If you save molecules with such a marker
set, it will in turn define their attachment site when they
<br>
are added to another drawing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Adding one of the predefined
templates: <br>
Selecting &rsquo;Templates&rsquo; from the
&rsquo;Tools&rsquo; menu opens a second window with a small
collection of predefined structures. Simply click on the
image of the desired molecule to add it to <br>
your drawing. The Template window can be kept open
throughout a chemtool session - if it is hidden by another
window, you can move it to the front by selecting the
&rsquo;Template&rsquo; <br>
menu in chemtool again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The data in the template system
differ from normal chemtool drawings only by the fact that
they are stored within the program, and in a slightly
awkward format (x and y coordi&acirc; <br>
nates listed separately in the source file templates.h).
These are meant to provide a convenient basis set available
to all users, but not individually extendable (you can use
<br>
the &rsquo;Add&rsquo; function for your own structures).
Please let us know if you want specific molecules added to
the templates - their name or ideally a regular chemtool
drawing file is <br>
all we need. (send email to
martin@ruby.chemie.uni-freiburg.de)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Importing foreign file formats:
<br>
Chemtool provides functions for importing files in both the
PDB format used by the Protein Database (and by most
molecular modeling packages) and the proprietary MDL molfile
for&acirc; <br>
mat used by ISISdraw and understood by other structure
drawing packages and database frontends.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As both are 3D file formats,
while chemtool only handles 2D projections, imported
molecules are read into a temporary storage at first and
displayed in blue on the canvas. This <br>
3D representation can then be rotated using the mouse. Only
after pressing the Return key on the keyboard is it
converted into the final 2D projection that can be edited.
While <br>
such a 3d import is in progress, all normal drawing and
editing functions are disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With MDL molfile import, the
carbon atom labels are automatically discarded. For PDB
import, the amount of labeling can be chosen in the file
selection dialog, which offers <br>
retention of either all labels, only those of non-hydrogen
atoms, or only the non-numeric part of the labels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the program babel is
installed - either the original version written by Pat
Walters or the more recent OpenBabel effort - chemtool will
automatically offer a menu option for <br>
importing from any of the file formats this supports.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Determining sum formula and
molecular weight: <br>
The distribution contains a helper program, cht(1), by Radek
Liboska (Prague) to calculate sum formula and (exact)
molecular weight from a chemtool drawing file. It is also
<br>
available from within chemtool to calculate these data for
the current structure or a marked fragment of it. cht can be
misled by duplicate bonds ( chemtool does not remove
over&acirc; <br>
lapping bonds, such as they might result from fusing ring
systems, automatically) and by the &rsquo;aromatic
ring&rsquo; symbol, so you should avoid these and check the
plausibility of the <br>
generated sum formula where possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Drawing functions not available
within Chemtool: <br>
For features not currently supported by chemtool, like
general line-drawing functions, getting Brian Smith&rsquo;s
XFig drawing package xfig is highly recommended. About the
only <br>
thing it does not offer is support for
&rsquo;chemical&rsquo; linetypes and drawing angles - which
is why chemtool was written as a sort of companion program.
(There will probably be more of <br>
the most sorely needed drawing options added to chemtool
over time, but duplicating the more general-purpose features
of xfig seems rather pointless.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LICENSE <br>
chemtool and its companion program cht are available under
the terms of the GNU General Public License (see the file
&rsquo;COPYING&rsquo; in the package). This software comes
with ABSO&acirc; <br>
LUTELY NO WARRANTY.</p>
