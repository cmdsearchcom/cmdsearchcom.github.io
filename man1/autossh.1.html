<p>AUTOSSH(1) BSD General Commands Manual AUTOSSH(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
autossh &acirc; monitor and restart ssh sessions</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
autossh [-V] [-M port[:echo_port]] [-f] [SSH_OPTIONS]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
autossh is a program to start a copy of ssh and monitor it,
restarting it as necessary should it die or stop passing
traffic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The original idea and the
mechanism were from rstunnel (Reliable SSH Tunnel). With
version 1.2 of autossh the method changed: autossh uses ssh
to construct a loop of ssh forward&acirc; <br>
ings (one from local to remote, one from remote to local),
and then sends test data that it expects to get back. (The
idea is thanks to Terrence Martin.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With version 1.3, a new method
is added (thanks to Ron Yorston): a port may be specified
for a remote echo service that will echo back the test data.
This avoids the congestion and <br>
the aggravation of making sure all the port numbers on the
remote machine do not collide. The loop-of-forwardings
method remains available for situations where using an echo
ser&acirc; <br>
vice may not be possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONTROLLING SSH <br>
SSH exits <br>
autossh tries to distinguish the manner of death of the ssh
process it is monitoring and act appropriately. The rules
are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. If the ssh process exited
normally (for example, someone typed &quot;exit&quot; in an
interactive session), autossh exits rather than
restarting;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. If autossh itself receives a
SIGTERM, SIGINT, or a SIGKILL signal, it assumes that it was
deliberately signalled, and exits after killing the child
ssh process;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. If autossh itself receives a
SIGUSR1 signal, it kills the child ssh process and starts a
new one;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. Periodically (by default
every 10 minutes), autossh attempts to pass traffic on the
monitor forwarded port. If this fails, autossh will kill the
child ssh process (if it is <br>
still running) and start a new one;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5. If the child ssh process dies
for any other reason, autossh will attempt to start a new
one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Startup behaviour <br>
If the ssh session fails with an exit status of 1 on the
very first try, autossh</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. will assume that there is
some problem with syntax or the connection setup, and will
exit rather than retrying;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. There is a &quot;starting
gate&quot; time. If the first ssh process fails within the
first few seconds of being started, autossh assumes that it
never made it &quot;out of the starting <br>
gate&quot;, and exits. This is to handle initial failed
authentication, connection, etc. This time is 30 seconds by
default, and can be adjusted (see the AUTOSSH_GATETIME
envi&acirc; <br>
ronment variable below). If AUTOSSH_GATETIME is set to 0,
then both behaviours are disabled: there is no
&quot;starting gate&quot;, and autossh will restart even if
ssh fails on the <br>
first run with an exit status of 1. The &quot;starting
gate&quot; time is also set to 0 when the -f flag to autossh
is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Continued failures <br>
If the ssh connection fails and attempts to restart it fail
in quick succession, autossh will start delaying its
attempts to restart, gradually backing farther and farther
off up <br>
to a maximum interval of the autossh poll time (usually 10
minutes). autossh can be &quot;prodded&quot; to retry by
signalling it, perhaps with SIGHUP (&quot;kill
-HUP&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Connection setup <br>
As connections must be established unattended, the use of
autossh requires that some form of automatic authentication
be set up. The use of RSAAuthentication with ssh-agent is
the <br>
recommended method. The example wrapper script attempts to
check if there is an agent running for the current
environment, and to start one if there isn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It cannot be stressed enough
that you must make sure ssh works on its own, that you can
set up the session you want before you try to run it under
autossh</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are tunnelling and using
an older version of ssh that does not support the -N flag,
you should upgrade (your version has security flaws). If you
can&rsquo;t upgrade, you may wish <br>
to do as rstunnel does, and give ssh a command to run, such
as &quot;sleep 99999999999&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-M port[:echo_port] <br>
specifies the base monitoring port to use. Without the echo
port, this port and the port immediately above it ( port +
1) should be something nothing else is using. <br>
autossh will send test data on the base monitoring port, and
receive it back on the port above. For example, if you
specify &acirc;-M 20000&acirc;, autossh will set up forwards
so that <br>
it can send data on port 20000 and receive it back on
20001.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alternatively, a port for a
remote echo service may be specified. This should be port 7
if you wish to use the standard inetd echo service. When an
echo port is specified, <br>
only the specified monitor port is used, and it carries the
monitor message in both directions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Many people disable the echo
service, or even disable inetd, so check that this service
is available on the remote machine. Some operating systems
allow one to specify that <br>
the service only listen on the localhost (loopback
interface), which would suffice for this use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The echo service may also be
something more complicated: perhaps a daemon that monitors a
group of ssh tunnels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Setting the monitor port to 0
turns the monitoring function off, and autossh will only
restart ssh upon ssh&rsquo;s exit. For example, if you are
using a recent version of <br>
OpenSSH, you may wish to explore using the
ServerAliveInterval and ServerAliveCountMax options to have
the SSH client exit if it finds itself no longer connected
to the <br>
server. In many ways this may be a better solution than the
monitoring port.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f causes autossh to drop to the
background before running ssh. The -f flag is stripped from
arguments passed to ssh. Note that there is a crucial a
difference between -f with <br>
autossh, and -f with ssh: when used with autossh ssh will be
unable to ask for passwords or passphrases. When -f is used,
the &quot;starting gate&quot; time (see AUTOSSH_GATETIME) is
<br>
set to 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V causes autossh to display its
version number and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
Other than the flag to set the connection monitoring port,
autossh uses environment variables to control features. ssh
seems to be still collecting letters for options, and this
<br>
seems the easiest way to avoid collisions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTOSSH_DEBUG <br>
If this variable is set, the logging level is set to to
LOG_DEBUG, and if the operating system supports it, syslog
is set to duplicate log entries to stderr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTOSSH_FIRST_POLL <br>
Specifies the time to wait before the first connection test.
Thereafter the general poll time is used (see AUTOSSH_POLL
below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTOSSH_GATETIME <br>
Specifies how long ssh must be up before we consider it a
successful connection. The default is 30 seconds. Note that
if AUTOSSH_GATETIME is set to 0, then not only is the <br>
gatetime behaviour turned off, but autossh also ignores the
first run failure of ssh. This may be useful when running
autossh at boot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTOSSH_LOGLEVEL <br>
Specifies the log level, corresponding to the levels used by
syslog; so 0-7 with 7 being the chattiest.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTOSSH_LOGFILE <br>
Specifies that autossh should use the named log file, rather
than syslog.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTOSSH_MAXLIFETIME <br>
Sets the maximum number of seconds that the program should
run. Once the number of seconds has been passed, the ssh
child will be killed and the program will exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTOSSH_MAXSTART <br>
Specifies how many times ssh should be started. A negative
number means no limit on the number of times ssh is started.
The default value is -1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTOSSH_MESSAGE <br>
Append message to echo message sent when testing
connections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTOSSH_NTSERVICE <br>
(Cygwin only.) When set to &quot;yes&quot; , autossh sets up
to run as an NT service under cygrunsrv. This adds the -N
flag for ssh if not already set, sets the log output to
stdout, <br>
and changes the behaviour on ssh exit so that it will
restart even on a normal exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTOSSH_PATH <br>
Specifies the path to the ssh executable, in case it is
different than the path compiled in.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTOSSH_PIDFILE <br>
Write autossh pid to specified file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTOSSH_POLL <br>
Specifies the connection poll time in seconds; default is
600 seconds. Unless AUTOSSH_FIRST_POLL is used, the first
poll time will set to match the poll time. If the poll <br>
time is less than twice the network timeouts (default 15
seconds) the network timeouts will be adjusted downward to
1/2 the poll time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTOSSH_PORT <br>
Sets the connection monitoring port. Mostly in case ssh
appropriates -M at some time. But because of this possible
use, AUTOSSH_PORT overrides the -M flag. A value of 0 <br>
turns the monitoring function off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEBIAN-SPECIFIC BEHAVIOR <br>
The debian version of autossh uses a wrapper to
automatically select a free monitoring port and -M overrides
AUTOSSH_PORT, see /usr/share/doc/autossh/README.Debian for
further <br>
information.</p>
