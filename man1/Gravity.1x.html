<p style="margin-top: 1em">when window decorations are
added to client window - frame window is moved so that
client window remains in exact position it was mapped
at.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">West</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Decorated window is moved so
that its left side is located at same position as left side
of undecorated client window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
When client window is mapped on screen - Window Manager
draws some frame decorations around it, such as Titlebar,
resize handles, etc. As such decorations take additional
space, <br>
it is nesseccary to specify if resulting larger window
should be moved on screen in any particular direction in
order to compensate for discrepancy in size. This is
determined by <br>
Gravity hint.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Usually Gravity is set by client
itself, depending on geometry specified by the user. For
example geometry -10+100 will set gravity to NorthEast,
while +10+100 will set gravity <br>
to NorthWest. Sometimes this gravity setting requested by
application is incorrect though, due to longstanding
tradition of misinterpretation of its meaning. In this cases
it may <br>
be desired to override gravity. AfterStep users can
accomplish that using database file, and definig new Style
for specific application with Gravity attribute set. For
example it <br>
is recommended to set gravity of popular image viewver XV to
be Static, as it tends to move self assuming that it knows
everything.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Below are the list of possible
gravity values with explanation of its meaning.</p>
