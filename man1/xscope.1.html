<p>XSCOPE(1) General Commands Manual XSCOPE(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
xscope - X Window Protocol Viewer</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
xscope [-i&lt;in-port&gt;] [-o&lt;out-port&gt;]
[-h&lt;server-host&gt;] [-d&lt;display-number&gt;] [-q]
[-v&lt;n&gt;] [-r] [-D&lt;debug-level&gt;] [-I]
[-S&lt;n&gt;] [-V] [-t]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Xscope sits in-between an X11 client and an X11 server and
prints the contents of each request, reply, error, or event
that is communicated between them. Xscope can decode the
<br>
core X11 protocol and several extensions, including
BIG-REQUESTS, LBX, MIT-SHM, NCD-WinCenterPro, RANDR, and
RENDER. This information can be useful in debugging and
performance <br>
tuning of X11 servers and clients.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To operate, xscope must know the
host, port, and display to use to connect to the X11 server.
In addition, it must know the port on which it should listen
for X11 clients. Two <br>
cases are common:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(1) The X11 server is on the
same host as xscope. <br>
In this case, the input port for xscope should be selected
as an X11 server on a different display, and the client
DISPLAY argument adjusted to select xscope . For example,
<br>
if the X11 server is on port 6001, display 1, then xscope
can use port 6002 as its input port. The client can use
display 1 for direct access to X11 or display 2 for access
<br>
to xscope.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(2) The X11 server is on a
different host than xscope. <br>
In this case the same input and output ports can be used,
and the host component of the DISPLAY is used to select
xscope or X11.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ARGUMENTS <br>
-i&lt;input-port&gt; <br>
Specify the port that xscope will use to take requests from
clients (defaults to 1). For X11, this port is automatically
biased by 6000.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o&lt;output-port&gt; <br>
Determines the port that xscope will use to connect to X11
(defaults to 0). For X11, this port is automatically biased
by 6000.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h&lt;host&gt; Determines the
host that xscope will use to find its X11 server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d&lt;display&gt; <br>
Defines the display number. The display number is added to
the input and output port to give the actual ports which are
used by xscope.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f&lt;filename&gt; <br>
Instead of decoding a live session, reads previously
captured raw data from a file to decode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Quiet output mode. Gives only
the names of requests, replies, errors, and events, but does
not indicate contents.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v&lt;print-level&gt; <br>
Determines the level of printing which xscope will provide.
The print-level can be 0 (same as quiet mode), 1, 2, 3, 4.
The larger numbers give more and more output. <br>
For example, a successful setup returns a string which is
the name of the vendor of the X11 server. At level 1, the
explicit field giving the length of the string is <br>
suppressed since it can be inferred from the string. At
level 2 and above the length is explicitly printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Print only raw data without
decoding it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D&lt;debug-level&gt; <br>
Print debugging information at the specified level.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I Enter interactive mode at
startup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S&lt;n&gt; Toggle output on or
off when SIGUSR1 is received. If n is 0, the initial state
is off. If n is 1, the initial state is on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Print version information and
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Terminate xscope when all
clients close.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INTERACTIVE MODE <br>
When xscope receives an interrupt signal (normally generated
by Control-C) or is started with the -I flag, it enters an
interactive mode in which it prompts for commands.
Avail&acirc; <br>
able commands in this mode are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">audio, a Show current verbosity
level for NAS protocol packets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">audio n, a n <br>
Set current verbosity level for NAS protocol packets to
n.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">break, b List currently defined
breakpoints.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">break request..., b request...
<br>
Create a breakpoint for the specified protocol requests. The
breakpoint will be enabled by default. When the breakpoint
is enabled, xscope will stop for interactive <br>
commands after processing a request of the specified type.
Requests and extensions may be specified by name or number.
If an extension is followed by a &quot;:&quot; and a <br>
number, it will only break for the specified minor opcode
for that extension. Note that since extension opcodes are
not known until the extension is first seen, <br>
breakpoints cannot currently be set on extensions until
after a QueryExtension request and reply are processed for
that extension, so users may need to initially set a <br>
breakpoint on QueryExtension, and after processing that set
the breakpoint for the target extension.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cont, c Resume processing of
data passing between server and clients.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">delete, del <br>
Delete all breakpoints.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">delete breakpoint..., del
breakpoint... <br>
Delete listed breakpoints, specified by number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">disable, d <br>
Disable all breakpoints.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">disable breakpoint..., d
breakpoint... <br>
Disable listed breakpoints, specified by number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">enable, e Enable all
breakpoints.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">enable breakpoint..., e
breakpoint... <br>
Enable listed breakpoints, specified by number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">help, ? Print list of available
commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">help command..., ? command...
<br>
Describe specified command or commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">level, l Show current verbosity
level for X11 protocol packets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">level n, l n <br>
Set current verbosity level for X11 protocol packets to
n.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">quit, q Quit xscope.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">step, s Process one request,
then prompt for another command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
xscope -v4 -hcleo -d0 -o0 -i1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command would have xscope
communicate with an X11 server on host
&lsquo;&lsquo;cleo&rsquo;&rsquo;, display 0; xscope itself
would be available on the current host as display 1 (display
of 0 plus <br>
the 1 of -i1). Verbose level 4.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xscope -q -d1 -o1 -o3</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The X11 server for the current
host, display 2 (1 for -d1 plus 1 for -o1) would be used by
xscope which would run as display 4 (1 for -d1 plus 3 for
-o3). Quiet mode (verbose <br>
level 0).</p>
