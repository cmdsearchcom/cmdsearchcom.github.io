This program is part of <b>Netpbm</b>(1)
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>pamarith</b> reads two PBM, PGM, PPM, or PAM images as input. It performs the
  specified binary arithmetic operation on their sample values and produces an
  output of a format which is the more general of the two input formats. The two
  input images must be of the same width and height. The arithmetic is performed
  on each pair of identically located tuples to generate the identically located
  tuple of the output.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For the purpose of the calculation, it assumes any PBM, PGM, or PPM input image
  is the equivalent PAM image of tuple type <b>BLACKANDWHITE</b>,
  <b>GRAYSCALE</b>, or <b>RGB</b>, respectively, and if it produces a PBM, PGM,
  or PPM output, produces the equivalent of the PAM image which is the result of
  the calculation.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The first <i>pamfile</i> argument identifies the 'left' argument image; the
  second <i>pamfile</i> argument identifies the 'right' one.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the output is PAM, the tuple type is the same as the tuple type of the left
  input image.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>pamarith</b> performs the arithmetic on each pair of identically located
  tuples in the two input images.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The arithmetic operation is in all cases fundamentally a function from two
  integers to an integer. The operation is performed on two tuples as follows.
  The two input images must have the same depth, or one of them must have depth
  one. <b>pamarith</b> fails if one of these is not the case.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If they have the same depth, <b>pamarith</b> simply carries out the arithmetic
  one sample at a time. I.e. if at a particular position the left input image
  contains the tuple (s1,s2,...,sN) and the right input image contains the tuple
  (t1,t2,...tN), and the function is f, then the output image contains the tuple
  (f(s1,t1),f(s2,t2),...,f(sN,tN)).
<div class="Pp"></div>
If one of the images has depth 1, the arithmetic is performed between the one
  sample in that image and each of the samples in the other. I.e. if at a
  particular position the left input image contains the tuple (s) and the right
  input image contains the tuple (t1,t2,...tN), and the function is f, then the
  output image contains the tuple (f(s,t1),f(s,t2),...,f(s,tN)).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Maxval"><a class="selflink" href="#Maxval">Maxval</a></h2>
The meanings of the samples with respect to the maxval varies according to the
  function you select.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In PAM images in general, the most usual meaning of a sample (the one that
  applies when a PAM image represents a visual image), is that it represents a
  fraction of some maximum. The maxval of the image corresponds to some maximum
  value (in the case of a visual image, it corresponds to 'full intensity.'),
  and a sample value divided by the maxval gives the fraction.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For <b>pamarith</b>, this interpretation applies to the regular arithmetic
  functions: <b>-add</b>, <b>-subtract</b>, <b>-multiply</b>, <b>-divide</b>,
  <b>-difference</b>, <b>-minimum</b>, <b>-maximum</b>, <b>-mean</b>, and
  <b>-compare</b>. For those, you should think of the arguments and result as
  numbers in the range [0,1). For example, if the maxval of the left argument
  image is 100 and the maxval of the right argument image is 200 and the maxval
  of the output image is 200, and the left sample value in an <b>-add</b>
  calculation is 50 and the right sample is 60, the actual calculation is 50/100
  + 60/200 = 160/200, and the output sample value is 160.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For these functions, <b>pamarith</b> makes the output image's maxval the maximum
  of the two input maxvals, except with <b>-compare</b>, where <b>pamarith</b>
  uses an output maxval of 2. (Before Netpbm 10.14 (February 2003), there was no
  exception for <b>-compare</b>; in 10.14, the exception was just that the
  maxval was <i>at least</i> 2, and sometime between 10.18 and 10.26 (January
  2005), it changed to being exactly 2).
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the result of a calculation falls outside the range [0, 1), <b>pamarith</b>
  clips it -- i.e. considers it to be zero or 1-.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In many cases, where both your input maxvals are the same, you can just think of
  the operation as taking place between the sample values directly, with no
  consideration of the maxval except for the clipping. E.g. an <b>-add</b> of
  sample value 5 to sample value 8 yields sample value 13.
<div class="Pp"></div>
But with <b>-multiply</b>, this doesn't work. Say your two input images have
  maxval 255, which means the output image also has maxval 255. Consider a
  location in the image where the input sample values are 5 and 10. You might
  think the multiplicative product of those would yield 50 in the output. But
  <b>pamarith</b> carries out the arithmetic on the fractions 5/255 and 10/255.
  It multiplies those together and then rescales to the output maxval, giving a
  sample value in the output PAM of 50/255 rounded to the nearest integer: 0.
<div class="Pp"></div>
With the bit string operations, the maxval has a whole different meaning. The
  operations in question are: <b>-and</b>, <b>-or</b>, <b>-nand</b>,
  <b>-nor</b>, <b>-xor</b>, and <b>-shiftleft</b>, <b>-shiftright</b>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
With these, each sample value in one or both input images, and in the output
  image, represents a bit string, not a number. The maxval tells how wide the
  bit string is. The maxval must be a full binary count (a power of two minus
  one, such as 0xff) and the number of ones in it is the width of the bit
  string. For the dyadic bit string operations (that's everything but the shift
  functions), the maxvals of the input images must be the same and
  <b>pamarith</b> makes the maxval of the output image the same.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For the bit shift operations, the output maxval is the same as the left input
  maxval. The right input image (which contains the shift counts) can have any
  maxval and the maxval is irrelevant to the interpretation of the samples. The
  sample value is the actual shift count. But it's still required that no sample
  value exceed the maxval.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="The_Operations"><a class="selflink" href="#The_Operations">The
  Operations</a></h2>
Most of the operations are obvious from the option name. The following
  paragraphs cover those that aren't.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-subtract</b> subtracts a value in the right input image from a value in the
  left input image.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-difference</b> calculates the absolute value of the difference.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-multiply</b> does an ordinary arithmetic multiplication, but tends to
  produce nonobvious results because of the way <b>pamarith</b> interprets
  sample values. See <a class="Lk" title="Lk" href="#maxval">Maxval</a> .
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-divide</b> divides a value in the left input image by the value in the left
  input image. But like <b>-multiply</b>, it tends to produce nonobvious
  results. Note that <b>pamarith</b> clipping behavior makes this of little use
  when the left argument (dividend) is greater than the right argument (divisor)
  -- the result in that case is always the maxval. If the divisor is 0, the
  result is the maxval. This option was new in Netpbm 10.30 (October 2005).
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-compare</b> produces the value <b>0</b> when the value in the left input
  image is less than the value in the right input image, <b>1</b> when the
  values are equal, and <b>2</b> when the left is greater than the right.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the maxvals of the input images are not identical, <b>pamarith</b> may claim
  two values are not equal when in fact they are, due to the precision with
  which it does the arithmetic. However, it will never say A is greater than B
  if A is less than B.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-compare</b> was new in Netpbm 10.13 (December 2002).
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-and</b>, <b>-nand</b>, <b>-or</b>, <b>-nor</b>, and <b>-xor</b> consider the
  input and output images to contain bit strings; they compute bitwise logic
  operations. Note that if the maxval is 1, you can also look at these as logic
  operations on boolean input values. See section
  <a class="Lk" title="Lk" href="#maxval">Maxval</a> for the special meaning of
  maxval with respect to bit string operations such as these.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-shiftleft</b> and <b>-shiftright</b> consider the left input image and
  output image to contain bit strings. They compute a bit shift operation, with
  bits falling off the left or right end and zeroes shifting in, as opposed to
  bits off one end to the other. The right input image sample value is the
  number of bit positions to shift.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that the maxval (see <a class="Lk" title="Lk" href="#maxval">Maxval</a> )
  determines the width of the frame within which you are shifting.

If you want to apply a unary function, e.g. &quot;halve&quot;, to a single
  image, use <b>pamfunc</b>.

<b>pamarith</b> replaced <b>pnmarith</b> in Netpbm 10.3 (June 2002).
<div class="Pp"></div>
In Netpbm 10.3 through 10.8, though, <b>pamarith</b> was not backward compatible
  because it required the input images to be of the same depth, so you could not
  multiply a PBM by a PPM as is often done for masking. (It was not intended at
  the time that <b>pnmarith</b> would be removed from Netpbm -- the plan was
  just to rewrite it to use <b>pamarith</b>; it was removed by mistake).
<div class="Pp"></div>
But starting with Netpbm 10.9 (September 2002), <b>pamarith</b> allows the
  images to have different depths as long as one of them has depth 1, and that
  made it backward compatible with <b>pnmarith</b>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The original <b>pnmarith</b> did not have the <b>-mean</b> option.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-compare</b> option was added in Netpbm 10.13 (December 2002).
<div class="Pp"></div>
The bit string operations were added in Netpbm 10.27 (March 2005).
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-divide</b> option was added in Netpbm 10.30 (October 2005).</div>
