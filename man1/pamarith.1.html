<p style="margin-top: 1em">All options can be abbreviated
to their shortest unique prefix. You may use two hyphens
instead of one. You may separate an option name and its
value with white space instead <br>
of an equals sign.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This program is part of Netpbm(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pamarith reads two PBM, PGM,
PPM, or PAM images as input. It performs the specified
binary arithmetic operation on their sample values and
produces an output of a format which <br>
is the more general of the two input formats. The two input
images must be of the same width and height. The arithmetic
is performed on each pair of identically located tuples <br>
to generate the identically located tuple of the output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For the purpose of the
calculation, it assumes any PBM, PGM, or PPM input image is
the equivalent PAM image of tuple type BLACKANDWHITE,
GRAYSCALE, or RGB, respectively, and if <br>
it produces a PBM, PGM, or PPM output, produces the
equivalent of the PAM image which is the result of the
calculation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first pamfile argument
identifies the &rsquo;left&rsquo; argument image; the second
pamfile argument identifies the &rsquo;right&rsquo; one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the output is PAM, the tuple
type is the same as the tuple type of the left input
image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pamarith performs the arithmetic
on each pair of identically located tuples in the two input
images.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The arithmetic operation is in
all cases fundamentally a function from two integers to an
integer. The operation is performed on two tuples as
follows. The two input images <br>
must have the same depth, or one of them must have depth
one. pamarith fails if one of these is not the case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If they have the same depth,
pamarith simply carries out the arithmetic one sample at a
time. I.e. if at a particular position the left input image
contains the tuple <br>
(s1,s2,...,sN) and the right input image contains the tuple
(t1,t2,...tN), and the function is f, then the output image
contains the tuple (f(s1,t1),f(s2,t2),...,f(sN,tN)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If one of the images has depth
1, the arithmetic is performed between the one sample in
that image and each of the samples in the other. I.e. if at
a particular position the <br>
left input image contains the tuple (s) and the right input
image contains the tuple (t1,t2,...tN), and the function is
f, then the output image contains the tuple <br>
(f(s,t1),f(s,t2),...,f(s,tN)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Maxval <br>
The meanings of the samples with respect to the maxval
varies according to the function you select.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In PAM images in general, the
most usual meaning of a sample (the one that applies when a
PAM image represents a visual image), is that it represents
a fraction of some maximum. <br>
The maxval of the image corresponds to some maximum value
(in the case of a visual image, it corresponds to
&rsquo;full intensity.&rsquo;), and a sample value divided
by the maxval gives the <br>
fraction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For pamarith, this
interpretation applies to the regular arithmetic functions:
-add, -subtract, -multiply, -divide, -difference, -minimum,
-maximum, -mean, and -compare. For <br>
those, you should think of the arguments and result as
numbers in the range [0,1). For example, if the maxval of
the left argument image is 100 and the maxval of the right
argu&acirc; <br>
ment image is 200 and the maxval of the output image is 200,
and the left sample value in an -add calculation is 50 and
the right sample is 60, the actual calculation is 50/100 +
<br>
60/200 = 160/200, and the output sample value is 160.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For these functions, pamarith
makes the output image&rsquo;s maxval the maximum of the two
input maxvals, except with -compare, where pamarith uses an
output maxval of 2. (Before <br>
Netpbm 10.14 (February 2003), there was no exception for
-compare; in 10.14, the exception was just that the maxval
was at least 2, and sometime between 10.18 and 10.26
(January <br>
2005), it changed to being exactly 2).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the result of a calculation
falls outside the range [0, 1), pamarith clips it -- i.e.
considers it to be zero or 1-.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In many cases, where both your
input maxvals are the same, you can just think of the
operation as taking place between the sample values
directly, with no consideration of the <br>
maxval except for the clipping. E.g. an -add of sample value
5 to sample value 8 yields sample value 13.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">But with -multiply, this
doesn&rsquo;t work. Say your two input images have maxval
255, which means the output image also has maxval 255.
Consider a location in the image where the <br>
input sample values are 5 and 10. You might think the
multiplicative product of those would yield 50 in the
output. But pamarith carries out the arithmetic on the
fractions <br>
5/255 and 10/255. It multiplies those together and then
rescales to the output maxval, giving a sample value in the
output PAM of 50/255 rounded to the nearest integer: 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With the bit string operations,
the maxval has a whole different meaning. The operations in
question are: -and, -or, -nand, -nor, -xor, and -shiftleft,
-shiftright.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With these, each sample value in
one or both input images, and in the output image,
represents a bit string, not a number. The maxval tells how
wide the bit string is. The max&acirc; <br>
val must be a full binary count (a power of two minus one,
such as 0xff) and the number of ones in it is the width of
the bit string. For the dyadic bit string operations <br>
(that&rsquo;s everything but the shift functions), the
maxvals of the input images must be the same and pamarith
makes the maxval of the output image the same.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For the bit shift operations,
the output maxval is the same as the left input maxval. The
right input image (which contains the shift counts) can have
any maxval and the maxval <br>
is irrelevant to the interpretation of the samples. The
sample value is the actual shift count. But it&rsquo;s still
required that no sample value exceed the maxval.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Operations <br>
Most of the operations are obvious from the option name. The
following paragraphs cover those that aren&rsquo;t.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-subtract subtracts a value in
the right input image from a value in the left input
image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-difference calculates the
absolute value of the difference.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-multiply does an ordinary
arithmetic multiplication, but tends to produce nonobvious
results because of the way pamarith interprets sample
values. See Maxval &acirc;&uml;#maxval&acirc;&copy; .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-divide divides a value in the
left input image by the value in the left input image. But
like -multiply, it tends to produce nonobvious results. Note
that pamarith clipping <br>
behavior makes this of little use when the left argument
(dividend) is greater than the right argument (divisor) --
the result in that case is always the maxval. If the divisor
<br>
is 0, the result is the maxval. This option was new in
Netpbm 10.30 (October 2005).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-compare produces the value 0
when the value in the left input image is less than the
value in the right input image, 1 when the values are equal,
and 2 when the left is greater <br>
than the right.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the maxvals of the input
images are not identical, pamarith may claim two values are
not equal when in fact they are, due to the precision with
which it does the arithmetic. <br>
However, it will never say A is greater than B if A is less
than B.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-compare was new in Netpbm 10.13
(December 2002).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-and, -nand, -or, -nor, and -xor
consider the input and output images to contain bit strings;
they compute bitwise logic operations. Note that if the
maxval is 1, you can also <br>
look at these as logic operations on boolean input values.
See section Maxval &acirc;&uml;#maxval&acirc;&copy; for the
special meaning of maxval with respect to bit string
operations such as these.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-shiftleft and -shiftright
consider the left input image and output image to contain
bit strings. They compute a bit shift operation, with bits
falling off the left or right end <br>
and zeroes shifting in, as opposed to bits off one end to
the other. The right input image sample value is the number
of bit positions to shift.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the maxval (see Maxval
&acirc;&uml;#maxval&acirc;&copy; ) determines the width of
the frame within which you are shifting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Notes <br>
If you want to apply a unary function, e.g.
&quot;halve&quot;, to a single image, use pamfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY <br>
pamarith replaced pnmarith in Netpbm 10.3 (June 2002).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In Netpbm 10.3 through 10.8,
though, pamarith was not backward compatible because it
required the input images to be of the same depth, so you
could not multiply a PBM by a PPM <br>
as is often done for masking. (It was not intended at the
time that pnmarith would be removed from Netpbm -- the plan
was just to rewrite it to use pamarith; it was removed by
<br>
mistake).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">But starting with Netpbm 10.9
(September 2002), pamarith allows the images to have
different depths as long as one of them has depth 1, and
that made it backward compatible with <br>
pnmarith.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The original pnmarith did not
have the -mean option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -compare option was added in
Netpbm 10.13 (December 2002).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The bit string operations were
added in Netpbm 10.27 (March 2005).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -divide option was added in
Netpbm 10.30 (October 2005).</p>
