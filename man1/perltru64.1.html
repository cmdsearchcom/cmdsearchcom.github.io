perltru64 - Perl version 5 on Tru64 (formerly known as Digital UNIX formerly
  known as DEC OSF/1) systems
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
This document describes various features of HP's (formerly Compaq's, formerly
  Digital's) Unix operating system (Tru64) that will affect how Perl version 5
  (hereafter just Perl) is configured, compiled and/or runs.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Compiling_Perl_5_on_Tru64"><a class="selflink" href="#Compiling_Perl_5_on_Tru64">Compiling
  Perl 5 on Tru64</a></h2>
The recommended compiler to use in Tru64 is the native C compiler. The native
  compiler produces much faster code (the speed difference is noticeable:
  several dozen percentages) and also more correct code: if you are considering
  using the GNU C compiler you should use at the very least the release of
  2.95.3 since all older gcc releases are known to produce broken code when
  compiling Perl. One manifestation of this brokenness is the lib/sdbm test
  dumping core; another is many of the op/regexp and op/pat, or ext/Storable
  tests dumping core (the exact pattern of failures depending on the GCC release
  and optimization flags).
<div class="Pp"></div>
gcc 3.2.1 is known to work okay with Perl 5.8.0. However, when optimizing the
  toke.c gcc likes to have a lot of memory, 256 megabytes seems to be enough.
  The default setting of the process data section in Tru64 should be one
  gigabyte, but some sites/setups might have lowered that. The configuration
  process of Perl checks for too low process limits, and lowers the optimization
  for the toke.c if necessary, and also gives advice on how to raise the process
  limits.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Also, Configure might abort with
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    Build a threading Perl? [n]
    Configure[2437]: Syntax error at line 1 : 'config.sh' is not expected.
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This indicates that Configure is being run with a broken Korn shell (even though
  you think you are using a Bourne shell by using &quot;sh Configure&quot; or
  &quot;./Configure&quot;). The Korn shell bug has been reported to Compaq as of
  February 1999 but in the meanwhile, the reason ksh is being used is that you
  have the environment variable BIN_SH set to 'xpg4'. This causes /bin/sh to
  delegate its duties to /bin/posix/sh (a ksh). Unset the environment variable
  and rerun Configure.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Using_Large_Files_with_Perl_on_Tru64"><a class="selflink" href="#Using_Large_Files_with_Perl_on_Tru64">Using
  Large Files with Perl on Tru64</a></h2>
In Tru64 Perl is automatically able to use large files, that is, files larger
  than 2 gigabytes, there is no need to use the Configure -Duselargefiles option
  as described in INSTALL (though using the option is harmless).
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Threaded_Perl_on_Tru64"><a class="selflink" href="#Threaded_Perl_on_Tru64">Threaded
  Perl on Tru64</a></h2>
If you want to use threads, you should primarily use the Perl 5.8.0 threads
  model by running Configure with -Duseithreads.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Perl threading is going to work only in Tru64 4.0 and newer releases, older
  operating releases like 3.2 aren't probably going to work properly with
  threads.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In Tru64 V5 (at least V5.1A, V5.1B) you cannot build threaded Perl with gcc
  because the system header &lt;pthread.h&gt; explicitly checks for supported C
  compilers, gcc (at least 3.2.2) not being one of them. But the system C
  compiler should work just fine.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Long_Doubles_on_Tru64"><a class="selflink" href="#Long_Doubles_on_Tru64">Long
  Doubles on Tru64</a></h2>
You cannot Configure Perl to use long doubles unless you have at least Tru64
  V5.0, the long double support simply wasn't functional enough before that.
  Perl's Configure will override attempts to use the long doubles (you can
  notice this by Configure finding out that the <i>modfl()</i> function does not
  work as it should).
<div class="Pp"></div>
At the time of this writing (June 2002), there is a known bug in the Tru64 libc
  printing of long doubles when not using &quot;e&quot; notation. The values are
  correct and usable, but you only get a limited number of digits displayed
  unless you force the issue by using &quot;printf &quot;%.33e&quot;,$num&quot;
  or the like. For Tru64 versions V5.0A through V5.1A, a patch is expected
  sometime after perl 5.8.0 is released. If your libc has not yet been patched,
  you'll get a warning from Configure when selecting long doubles.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="DB_File_tests_failing_on_Tru64"><a class="selflink" href="#DB_File_tests_failing_on_Tru64">DB_File
  tests failing on Tru64</a></h2>
The DB_File tests (db-btree.t, db-hash.t, db-recno.t) may fail you have
  installed a newer version of Berkeley DB into the system and the -I and -L
  compiler and linker flags introduce version conflicts with the DB 1.85 headers
  and libraries that came with the Tru64. For example, mixing a DB v2 library
  with the DB v1 headers is a bad idea. Watch out for Configure options
  -Dlocincpth and -Dloclibpth, and check your /usr/local/include and
  /usr/local/lib since they are included by default.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The second option is to explicitly instruct Configure to detect the newer
  Berkeley DB installation, by supplying the right directories with
  &quot;-Dlocincpth=/some/include&quot; and &quot;-Dloclibpth=/some/lib&quot;
  <b>and</b> before running &quot;make test&quot; setting your LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  to <i>/some/lib</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The third option is to work around the problem by disabling the DB_File
  completely when build Perl by specifying -Ui_db to Configure, and then using
  the BerkeleyDB module from CPAN instead of DB_File. The BerkeleyDB works with
  Berkeley DB versions 2.* or greater.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The Berkeley DB 4.1.25 has been tested with Tru64 V5.1A and found to work. The
  latest Berkeley DB can be found from &lt;http://www.sleepycat.com&gt;.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="64-bit_Perl_on_Tru64"><a class="selflink" href="#64-bit_Perl_on_Tru64">64-bit
  Perl on Tru64</a></h2>
In Tru64 Perl's integers are automatically 64-bit wide, there is no need to use
  the Configure -Duse64bitint option as described in INSTALL. Similarly, there
  is no need for -Duse64bitall since pointers are automatically 64-bit wide.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Warnings_about_floating-point_overflow_when_compiling_Perl_on_Tru64"><a class="selflink" href="#Warnings_about_floating-point_overflow_when_compiling_Perl_on_Tru64">Warnings
  about floating-point overflow when compiling Perl on Tru64</a></h2>
When compiling Perl in Tru64 you may (depending on the compiler release) see two
  warnings like this
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    cc: Warning: numeric.c, line 104: In this statement, floating-point overflow occurs in evaluating the expression &quot;1.8e308&quot;. (floatoverfl)
        return HUGE_VAL;
    -----------^
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
and when compiling the POSIX extension
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    cc: Warning: const-c.inc, line 2007: In this statement, floating-point overflow occurs in evaluating the expression &quot;1.8e308&quot;. (floatoverfl)
                return HUGE_VAL;
    -------------------^
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The exact line numbers may vary between Perl releases. The warnings are benign
  and can be ignored: in later C compiler releases the warnings should be gone.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When the file <i>pp_sys.c</i> is being compiled you may (depending on the
  operating system release) see an additional compiler flag being used:
  &quot;-DNO_EFF_ONLY_OK&quot;. This is normal and refers to a feature that is
  relevant only if you use the &quot;filetest&quot; pragma. In older releases of
  the operating system the feature was broken and the NO_EFF_ONLY_OK instructs
  Perl not to use the feature.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Testing_Perl_on_Tru64"><a class="selflink" href="#Testing_Perl_on_Tru64">Testing
  Perl on Tru64</a></h1>
During &quot;make test&quot; the &quot;comp/cpp&quot; will be skipped because on
  Tru64 it cannot be tested before Perl has been installed. The test refers to
  the use of the &quot;-P&quot; option of Perl.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ext/ODBM_File/odbm_Test_Failing_With_Static_Builds"><a class="selflink" href="#ext/ODBM_File/odbm_Test_Failing_With_Static_Builds">ext/ODBM_File/odbm
  Test Failing With Static Builds</a></h1>
The ext/ODBM_File/odbm is known to fail with static builds (Configure -Uusedl)
  due to a known bug in Tru64's static libdbm library. The good news is that you
  very probably don't need to ever use the ODBM_File extension since more
  advanced NDBM_File works fine, not to mention the even more advanced DB_File.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Perl_Fails_Because_Of_Unresolved_Symbol_sockatmark"><a class="selflink" href="#Perl_Fails_Because_Of_Unresolved_Symbol_sockatmark">Perl
  Fails Because Of Unresolved Symbol sockatmark</a></h1>
If you get an error like
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    Can't load '.../OSF1/lib/perl5/5.8.0/alpha-dec_osf/auto/IO/IO.so' for module IO: Unresolved symbol in .../lib/perl5/5.8.0/alpha-dec_osf/auto/IO/IO.so: sockatmark at .../lib/perl5/5.8.0/alpha-dec_osf/XSLoader.pm line 75.
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
you need to either recompile your Perl in Tru64 4.0D or upgrade your Tru64 4.0D
  to at least 4.0F: the <i>sockatmark()</i> system call was added in Tru64 4.0F,
  and the IO extension refers that symbol.
