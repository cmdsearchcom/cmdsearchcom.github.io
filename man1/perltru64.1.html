<p>PERLTRU64(1) Perl Programmers Reference Guide
PERLTRU64(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
perltru64 - Perl version 5 on Tru64 (formerly known as
Digital UNIX formerly known as DEC OSF/1) systems</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This document describes various features of HP&rsquo;s
(formerly Compaq&rsquo;s, formerly Digital&rsquo;s) Unix
operating system (Tru64) that will affect how Perl version 5
(hereafter just Perl) <br>
is configured, compiled and/or runs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Compiling Perl 5 on Tru64 <br>
The recommended compiler to use in Tru64 is the native C
compiler. The native compiler produces much faster code (the
speed difference is noticeable: several dozen percentages)
<br>
and also more correct code: if you are considering using the
GNU C compiler you should use at the very least the release
of 2.95.3 since all older gcc releases are known to <br>
produce broken code when compiling Perl. One manifestation
of this brokenness is the lib/sdbm test dumping core;
another is many of the op/regexp and op/pat, or ext/Storable
<br>
tests dumping core (the exact pattern of failures depending
on the GCC release and optimization flags).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gcc 3.2.1 is known to work okay
with Perl 5.8.0. However, when optimizing the toke.c gcc
likes to have a lot of memory, 256 megabytes seems to be
enough. The default setting of <br>
the process data section in Tru64 should be one gigabyte,
but some sites/setups might have lowered that. The
configuration process of Perl checks for too low process
limits, and <br>
lowers the optimization for the toke.c if necessary, and
also gives advice on how to raise the process limits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also, Configure might abort
with</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Build a threading Perl? [n] <br>
Configure[2437]: Syntax error at line 1 :
&rsquo;config.sh&rsquo; is not expected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This indicates that Configure is
being run with a broken Korn shell (even though you think
you are using a Bourne shell by using &quot;sh
Configure&quot; or &quot;./Configure&quot;). The Korn shell
<br>
bug has been reported to Compaq as of February 1999 but in
the meanwhile, the reason ksh is being used is that you have
the environment variable BIN_SH set to &rsquo;xpg4&rsquo;.
This <br>
causes /bin/sh to delegate its duties to /bin/posix/sh (a
ksh). Unset the environment variable and rerun
Configure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using Large Files with Perl on
Tru64 <br>
In Tru64 Perl is automatically able to use large files, that
is, files larger than 2 gigabytes, there is no need to use
the Configure -Duselargefiles option as described in <br>
INSTALL (though using the option is harmless).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Threaded Perl on Tru64 <br>
If you want to use threads, you should primarily use the
Perl 5.8.0 threads model by running Configure with
-Duseithreads.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl threading is going to work
only in Tru64 4.0 and newer releases, older operating
releases like 3.2 aren&rsquo;t probably going to work
properly with threads.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In Tru64 V5 (at least V5.1A,
V5.1B) you cannot build threaded Perl with gcc because the
system header &lt;pthread.h&gt; explicitly checks for
supported C compilers, gcc (at least <br>
3.2.2) not being one of them. But the system C compiler
should work just fine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Long Doubles on Tru64 <br>
You cannot Configure Perl to use long doubles unless you
have at least Tru64 V5.0, the long double support simply
wasn&rsquo;t functional enough before that. Perl&rsquo;s
Configure will <br>
override attempts to use the long doubles (you can notice
this by Configure finding out that the modfl() function does
not work as it should).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At the time of this writing
(June 2002), there is a known bug in the Tru64 libc printing
of long doubles when not using &quot;e&quot; notation. The
values are correct and usable, but you <br>
only get a limited number of digits displayed unless you
force the issue by using &quot;printf
&quot;%.33e&quot;,$num&quot; or the like. For Tru64 versions
V5.0A through V5.1A, a patch is expected <br>
sometime after perl 5.8.0 is released. If your libc has not
yet been patched, you&rsquo;ll get a warning from Configure
when selecting long doubles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DB_File tests failing on Tru64
<br>
The DB_File tests (db-btree.t, db-hash.t, db-recno.t) may
fail you have installed a newer version of Berkeley DB into
the system and the -I and -L compiler and linker flags <br>
introduce version conflicts with the DB 1.85 headers and
libraries that came with the Tru64. For example, mixing a DB
v2 library with the DB v1 headers is a bad idea. Watch out
<br>
for Configure options -Dlocincpth and -Dloclibpth, and check
your /usr/local/include and /usr/local/lib since they are
included by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The second option is to
explicitly instruct Configure to detect the newer Berkeley
DB installation, by supplying the right directories with
&quot;-Dlocincpth=/some/include&quot; and <br>
&quot;-Dloclibpth=/some/lib&quot; and before running
&quot;make test&quot; setting your LD_LIBRARY_PATH to
/some/lib.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The third option is to work
around the problem by disabling the DB_File completely when
build Perl by specifying -Ui_db to Configure, and then using
the BerkeleyDB module from <br>
CPAN instead of DB_File. The BerkeleyDB works with Berkeley
DB versions 2.* or greater.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Berkeley DB 4.1.25 has been
tested with Tru64 V5.1A and found to work. The latest
Berkeley DB can be found from
&lt;http://www.sleepycat.com&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">64-bit Perl on Tru64 <br>
In Tru64 Perl&rsquo;s integers are automatically 64-bit
wide, there is no need to use the Configure -Duse64bitint
option as described in INSTALL. Similarly, there is no need
for <br>
-Duse64bitall since pointers are automatically 64-bit
wide.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warnings about floating-point
overflow when compiling Perl on Tru64 <br>
When compiling Perl in Tru64 you may (depending on the
compiler release) see two warnings like this</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cc: Warning: numeric.c, line
104: In this statement, floating-point overflow occurs in
evaluating the expression &quot;1.8e308&quot;. (floatoverfl)
<br>
return HUGE_VAL; <br>
-----------^</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and when compiling the POSIX
extension</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cc: Warning: const-c.inc, line
2007: In this statement, floating-point overflow occurs in
evaluating the expression &quot;1.8e308&quot;. (floatoverfl)
<br>
return HUGE_VAL; <br>
-------------------^</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The exact line numbers may vary
between Perl releases. The warnings are benign and can be
ignored: in later C compiler releases the warnings should be
gone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the file pp_sys.c is being
compiled you may (depending on the operating system release)
see an additional compiler flag being used:
&quot;-DNO_EFF_ONLY_OK&quot;. This is normal and <br>
refers to a feature that is relevant only if you use the
&quot;filetest&quot; pragma. In older releases of the
operating system the feature was broken and the
NO_EFF_ONLY_OK instructs <br>
Perl not to use the feature.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Testing Perl on Tru64 <br>
During &quot;make test&quot; the &quot;comp/cpp&quot; will
be skipped because on Tru64 it cannot be tested before Perl
has been installed. The test refers to the use of the
&quot;-P&quot; option of Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ext/ODBM_File/odbm Test Failing
With Static Builds <br>
The ext/ODBM_File/odbm is known to fail with static builds
(Configure -Uusedl) due to a known bug in Tru64&rsquo;s
static libdbm library. The good news is that you very
probably don&rsquo;t <br>
need to ever use the ODBM_File extension since more advanced
NDBM_File works fine, not to mention the even more advanced
DB_File.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl Fails Because Of Unresolved
Symbol sockatmark <br>
If you get an error like</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t load
&rsquo;.../OSF1/lib/perl5/5.8.0/alpha-dec_osf/auto/IO/IO.so&rsquo;
for module IO: Unresolved symbol in
.../lib/perl5/5.8.0/alpha-dec_osf/auto/IO/IO.so: sockatmark
at .../lib/perl5/5.8.0/alpha-dec_osf/XSLoader.pm line
75.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">you need to either recompile
your Perl in Tru64 4.0D or upgrade your Tru64 4.0D to at
least 4.0F: the sockatmark() system call was added in Tru64
4.0F, and the IO extension <br>
refers that symbol.</p>
