<b>manlifter</b> is a script that sequences <b>doclifter</b>(1) to convert an
  entire manual-page tree to XML-Docbook, optionally also generating HTML from
  the XML. Another use is as a torture-test tool for doclifter; it logs errors
  to standard output and collects timings.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Called without any file arguments, manlifter tries to convert all eligible man
  pages installed on the system, placing the resulting xml files under xmlman in
  the current directory. Each successfully translated page foo.N is copied to
  manN/foo.xml beneath the output directory, regardless of what source directory
  it came from.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A manual page is considered ineligible for batch conversion if it contains text
  indicating it has been generated from DocBook masters of from Doxygen.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For each source file examined, if the destination file exists and is newer than
  the source, the conversion is skipped; thus, incremental runs of
  <b>manlifter</b> do the least work needed to keep the target XML tree up to
  date. Likewise, in -h mode derived HTML files are only made when necessary.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Stub pages that are just <b>.so</b> redirections are translated to corresponding
  symlinks of XML files (and, with -h, HTML files).
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>manlifter</b> may also be called with a single file argument, which is
  interpreted as the stem name of a potential manual page. <b>manlifter</b> then
  searches all selected manual sections for a matching page and attempts to
  convert it. In this case, a copy of the man page and the converted version are
  dropped immediately beheath the output directory, with the names foobar.man
  and foobar.man.xml, respectively. This mode is normally only of interest only
  to <b>doclifter</b> developers for debugging that program.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In either of the above cases, <b>manlifter</b> will uncompress the file if it
  has a .gz, .bz2 or .Z suffix on the name.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Options are as follows:
<div class="Pp"></div>
-d
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Pass the string argument to each doclifter
  call as options. Each space-separated token in the string becomes a separate
  argument in the call.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-e
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Run in log-filter mode (mainly of interest to
  <b>doclifter</b> developers). In this mode, <b>manlifter</b> reads a test log
  from standard input and filters it in a a way dependent on the -f and -q
  options. If neither of these is given, messages from successful runs are
  stripped out and only errors passed through to standard output.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-f
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Normally, run doclifter on the files named by
  each line in the argument file. In error-filter mode the argument is instead
  interpreted as a filtering regular expression.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-h
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Also generate HTML translations into the
  output directory. DocBook citerefentry markup is transformed to hyperlinks in
  the directory, and a contents listing is generated to index.html.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-I
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Specify the root of the manual-page tree. By
  default this is /usr/share/man.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-m
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Make a patch to correct the last page fetched.
  It is copied, an editor is called on the copy (using the environment variable
  <b>$EDITOR</b>), and then <b>diff</b>(1) is called to drop the patch in the
  prepatch directory. Fails with an error if such a patch is already
  present.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-M
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Lift the specified files, then do the
  equivalent of the -m option.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-o
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Set the output directory into which
  XML-DocBook translations will be dropped. By default this is xmlman under the
  current directory in batch mode, or the current directory otherwise.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-p
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Interpret the argument as the name of a patch
  directory (the default name is prepatch under the current directory). Each
  file named foo.N.patch is interpreted as a patch to be applied to the manual
  page foo(N) before doclifter translates it.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-P
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Enable profiling using the Python hotshot
  module; this is only useful for tuning doclifter so it runs faster. Raw data
  is written to manlifter.prof, and a digested report is appended to the log on
  standard output. Warning: the raw data files can become huge, and the
  postprocessing for report generation can take as long as the actual processing
  (or longer!).</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-q
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Normally, pass the -q (quiet) option to each
  doclifter call. In error-filter mode, return a list of files on which
  translation failed.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-v
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Pass the -v (verbose) option to each doclifter
  call. This option can be repeated to increase the verbosity level.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-s
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Specify a section to scan. Use this with an
  argument; it should not be necessary when doing a conversion of the entire
  tree.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-S
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Compile error statistics from a
  <b>manlifter</b> logfile presented on standard input. This option will be of
  interest mainly to <b>doclifter</b> developers.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-X
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">In batch mode exclude pages listed in the
  argument file. Meant to be used for pages that are known good and take an
  extremely long time to lift, in order to cut down the time for a test run.
  (Most pages lift in less than a half second, but a few can take 15 minutes or
  longer.)</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>manlifter</b> emits a logfile to standard output. The file begins with a
  timestamp line and a blank line, and ends with a line giving run time and
  various interesting statistics. Between these are stanzas, separated by blank
  lines, one for each file on which <b>doclifter</b> was run.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The first line of each stanza beguns with &quot;! &quot;, followed by the
  pathname of the source manual pager, followed by &quot;=&quot; and the return
  status of doclifter run on that file. Following that is a space and
  <b>doclifter</b>'s runtime in seconds.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This initial line may be followed by information messages and the error output
  of the doclifter run.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>manlifter</b> must find a copy of <b>doclifter</b> in either the current
  directory or one of the command directories in your <b>PATH</b> in order to
  run.

HTML generation is painfully slow. Unfortunately, there is little we can do to
  remedy this, because XSLT engines are painfully slow.
