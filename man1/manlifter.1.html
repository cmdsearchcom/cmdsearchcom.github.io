<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
manlifter - mass-conversion script and test harness for
doclifter</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
manlifter [-d option] [-e] [-f listfile] [-h] [-I mandir]
[-m] [-M] [-o outdir] [-p patch-directory] [-P] [-q] [-v]
[-s section] [-X exclude] name...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">manlifter [-S]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
manlifter is a script that sequences doclifter(1) to convert
an entire manual-page tree to XML-Docbook, optionally also
generating HTML from the XML. Another use is as a <br>
torture-test tool for doclifter; it logs errors to standard
output and collects timings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Called without any file
arguments, manlifter tries to convert all eligible man pages
installed on the system, placing the resulting xml files
under xmlman in the current <br>
directory. Each successfully translated page foo.N is copied
to manN/foo.xml beneath the output directory, regardless of
what source directory it came from.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A manual page is considered
ineligible for batch conversion if it contains text
indicating it has been generated from DocBook masters of
from Doxygen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For each source file examined,
if the destination file exists and is newer than the source,
the conversion is skipped; thus, incremental runs of
manlifter do the least work <br>
needed to keep the target XML tree up to date. Likewise, in
-h mode derived HTML files are only made when necessary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Stub pages that are just .so
redirections are translated to corresponding symlinks of XML
files (and, with -h, HTML files).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">manlifter may also be called
with a single file argument, which is interpreted as the
stem name of a potential manual page. manlifter then
searches all selected manual sections <br>
for a matching page and attempts to convert it. In this
case, a copy of the man page and the converted version are
dropped immediately beheath the output directory, with the
<br>
names foobar.man and foobar.man.xml, respectively. This mode
is normally only of interest only to doclifter developers
for debugging that program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In either of the above cases,
manlifter will uncompress the file if it has a .gz, .bz2 or
.Z suffix on the name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d <br>
Pass the string argument to each doclifter call as options.
Each space-separated token in the string becomes a separate
argument in the call.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e <br>
Run in log-filter mode (mainly of interest to doclifter
developers). In this mode, manlifter reads a test log from
standard input and filters it in a a way dependent on the
<br>
-f and -q options. If neither of these is given, messages
from successful runs are stripped out and only errors passed
through to standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f <br>
Normally, run doclifter on the files named by each line in
the argument file. In error-filter mode the argument is
instead interpreted as a filtering regular expression.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h <br>
Also generate HTML translations into the output directory.
DocBook citerefentry markup is transformed to hyperlinks in
the directory, and a contents listing is generated to <br>
index.html.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I <br>
Specify the root of the manual-page tree. By default this is
/usr/share/man.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m <br>
Make a patch to correct the last page fetched. It is copied,
an editor is called on the copy (using the environment
variable $EDITOR), and then diff(1) is called to drop the
<br>
patch in the prepatch directory. Fails with an error if such
a patch is already present.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M <br>
Lift the specified files, then do the equivalent of the -m
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o <br>
Set the output directory into which XML-DocBook translations
will be dropped. By default this is xmlman under the current
directory in batch mode, or the current directory <br>
otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p <br>
Interpret the argument as the name of a patch directory (the
default name is prepatch under the current directory). Each
file named foo.N.patch is interpreted as a patch to <br>
be applied to the manual page foo(N) before doclifter
translates it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P <br>
Enable profiling using the Python hotshot module; this is
only useful for tuning doclifter so it runs faster. Raw data
is written to manlifter.prof, and a digested report is <br>
appended to the log on standard output. Warning: the raw
data files can become huge, and the postprocessing for
report generation can take as long as the actual processing
<br>
(or longer!).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q <br>
Normally, pass the -q (quiet) option to each doclifter call.
In error-filter mode, return a list of files on which
translation failed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v <br>
Pass the -v (verbose) option to each doclifter call. This
option can be repeated to increase the verbosity level.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s <br>
Specify a section to scan. Use this with an argument; it
should not be necessary when doing a conversion of the
entire tree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S <br>
Compile error statistics from a manlifter logfile presented
on standard input. This option will be of interest mainly to
doclifter developers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X <br>
In batch mode exclude pages listed in the argument file.
Meant to be used for pages that are known good and take an
extremely long time to lift, in order to cut down the time
<br>
for a test run. (Most pages lift in less than a half second,
but a few can take 15 minutes or longer.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">manlifter emits a logfile to
standard output. The file begins with a timestamp line and a
blank line, and ends with a line giving run time and various
interesting statistics. <br>
Between these are stanzas, separated by blank lines, one for
each file on which doclifter was run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first line of each stanza
beguns with &quot;! &quot;, followed by the pathname of the
source manual pager, followed by &quot;=&quot; and the
return status of doclifter run on that file. <br>
Following that is a space and doclifter&rsquo;s runtime in
seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This initial line may be
followed by information messages and the error output of the
doclifter run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">manlifter must find a copy of
doclifter in either the current directory or one of the
command directories in your PATH in order to run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
HTML generation is painfully slow. Unfortunately, there is
little we can do to remedy this, because XSLT engines are
painfully slow.</p>
