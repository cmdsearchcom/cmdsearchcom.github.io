<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pterm &acirc; yet another X terminal emulator</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pterm [ options ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
pterm is a terminal emulator for X. It is based on a port of
the terminal emulation engine in the Windows SSH client
PuTTY.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The command-line options supported by pterm are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e command [ arguments ] <br>
Specify a command to be executed in the new terminal.
Everything on the command line after this option will be
passed straight to the execvp system call; so if you need
<br>
the command to redirect its input or output, you will have
to use sh:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pterm -e sh -c &rsquo;mycommand
&lt; inputfile&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--display display-name <br>
Specify the X display on which to open pterm. (Note this
option has a double minus sign, even though none of the
others do. This is because this option is supplied
auto&acirc; <br>
matically by GTK. Sorry.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-name name <br>
Specify the name under which pterm looks up X resources.
Normally it will look them up as (for example) pterm.Font.
If you specify &lsquo;-name xyz&rsquo;, it will look them up
as <br>
xyz.Font instead. This allows you to set up several
different sets of defaults and choose between them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fn font-name <br>
Specify the font to use for normal text displayed in the
terminal. For example, -fn fixed, -fn &quot;Monospace
12&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fb font-name <br>
Specify the font to use for bold text displayed in the
terminal. If the BoldAsColour resource is set to 1 (the
default), bold text will be displayed in different colours
<br>
instead of a different font, so this option will be ignored.
If BoldAsColour is set to 0 or 2 and you do not specify a
bold font, pterm will overprint the normal font to <br>
make it look bolder.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fw font-name <br>
Specify the font to use for double-width characters
(typically Chinese, Japanese and Korean text) displayed in
the terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fwb font-name <br>
Specify the font to use for bold double-width characters
(typically Chinese, Japanese and Korean text). Like -fb,
this will be ignored unless the BoldAsColour resource is
<br>
set to 0 or 2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-geometry geometry <br>
Specify the size of the terminal, in rows and columns of
text. See X(7) for more information on the syntax of
geometry specifications.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sl lines <br>
Specify the number of lines of scrollback to save off the
top of the terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fg colour <br>
Specify the foreground colour to use for normal text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-bg colour <br>
Specify the background colour to use for normal text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-bfg colour <br>
Specify the foreground colour to use for bold text, if the
BoldAsColour resource is set to 1 (the default) or 2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-bbg colour <br>
Specify the foreground colour to use for bold reverse-video
text, if the BoldAsColour resource is set to 1 (the default)
or 2. (This colour is best thought of as the bold <br>
version of the background colour; so it only appears when
text is displayed in the background colour.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-cfg colour <br>
Specify the foreground colour to use for text covered by the
cursor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-cbg colour <br>
Specify the background colour to use for text covered by the
cursor. In other words, this is the main colour of the
cursor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-title title <br>
Specify the initial title of the terminal window. (This can
be changed under control of the server.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ut- or +ut <br>
Tells pterm not to record your login in the utmp, wtmp and
lastlog system log files; so you will not show up on finger
or who listings, for example.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ut Tells pterm to record your
login in utmp, wtmp and lastlog: this is the opposite of
-ut-. This is the default option: you will probably only
need to specify it explicitly <br>
if you have changed the default using the StampUtmp
resource.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ls- or +ls <br>
Tells pterm not to execute your shell as a login shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ls Tells pterm to execute your
shell as a login shell: this is the opposite of -ls-. This
is the default option: you will probably only need to
specify it explicitly if you <br>
have changed the default using the LoginShell resource.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sb- or +sb <br>
Tells pterm not to display a scroll bar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sb Tells pterm to display a
scroll bar: this is the opposite of -sb-. This is the
default option: you will probably only need to specify it
explicitly if you have changed the <br>
default using the ScrollBar resource.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-log logfile, -sessionlog
logfile <br>
This option makes pterm log all the terminal output to a
file as well as displaying it in the terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-cs charset <br>
This option specifies the character set in which pterm
should assume the session is operating. This character set
will be used to interpret all the data received from the
<br>
session, and all input you type or paste into pterm will be
converted into this character set before being sent to the
session.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any character set name which is
valid in a MIME header (and supported by pterm) should be
valid here (examples are &lsquo;ISO-8859-1&rsquo;,
&lsquo;windows-1252&rsquo; or &lsquo;UTF-8&rsquo;). Also,
any <br>
character encoding which is valid in an X logical font
description should be valid (&lsquo;ibm-cp437&rsquo;, for
example).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pterm&rsquo;s default behaviour
is to use the same character encoding as its primary font.
If you supply a Unicode (iso10646-1) font, it will default
to the UTF-8 character set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Character set names are
case-insensitive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nethack <br>
Tells pterm to enable NetHack keypad mode, in which the
numeric keypad generates the NetHack hjklyubn direction
keys. This enables you to play NetHack with the numeric <br>
keypad without having to use the NetHack number_pad option
(which requires you to press &lsquo;n&rsquo; before any
repeat count). So you can move with the numeric keypad, and
enter <br>
repeat counts with the normal number keys.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-xrm resource-string <br>
This option specifies an X resource string. Useful for
setting resources which do not have their own command-line
options. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pterm -xrm
&rsquo;ScrollbarOnLeft: 1&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-help, --help <br>
Display a message summarizing the available options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pgpfp Display the fingerprints
of the PuTTY PGP Master Keys, to aid in verifying new files
released by the PuTTY team.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">X RESOURCES <br>
pterm can be more completely configured by means of X
resources. All of these resources are of the form pterm.FOO
for some FOO; you can make pterm look them up under another
<br>
name, such as xyz.FOO, by specifying the command-line option
&lsquo;-name xyz&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pterm.CloseOnExit <br>
This option should be set to 0, 1 or 2; the default is 2. It
controls what pterm does when the process running inside it
terminates. When set to 2 (the default), pterm <br>
will close its window as soon as the process inside it
terminates. When set to 0, pterm will print the
process&rsquo;s exit status, and the window will remain
present until a <br>
key is pressed (allowing you to inspect the scrollback, and
copy and paste text out of it).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When this setting is set to 1,
pterm will close immediately if the process exits cleanly
(with an exit status of zero), but the window will stay
around if the process <br>
exits with a non-zero code or on a signal. This enables you
to see what went wrong if the process suffers an error, but
not to have to bother closing the window in normal <br>
circumstances.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pterm.WarnOnClose <br>
This option should be set to either 0 or 1; the default is
1. When set to 1, pterm will ask for confirmation before
closing its window when you press the close button.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pterm.TerminalType <br>
This controls the value set in the TERM environment variable
inside the new terminal. The default is
&lsquo;xterm&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pterm.BackspaceIsDelete <br>
This option should be set to either 0 or 1; the default is
1. When set to 0, the ordinary Backspace key generates the
Backspace character (^H); when set to 1, it generates <br>
the Delete character (^?). Whichever one you set, the
terminal device inside pterm will be set up to expect
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pterm.RXVTHomeEnd <br>
This option should be set to either 0 or 1; the default is
0. When it is set to 1, the Home and End keys generate the
control sequences they would generate in the rxvt <br>
terminal emulator, instead of the more usual ones generated
by other emulators.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pterm.LinuxFunctionKeys <br>
This option can be set to any number between 0 and 5
inclusive; the default is 0. The modes vary the control
sequences sent by the function keys; for more complete
docu&acirc; <br>
mentation, it is probably simplest to try each option in
&lsquo;pterm -e cat&rsquo;, and press the keys to see what
they generate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pterm.NoApplicationKeys <br>
This option should be set to either 0 or 1; the default is
0. When set to 1, it stops the server from ever switching
the numeric keypad into application mode (where the <br>
keys send function-key-like sequences instead of numbers or
arrow keys). You probably only need this if some application
is making a nuisance of itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pterm.NoApplicationCursors <br>
This option should be set to either 0 or 1; the default is
0. When set to 1, it stops the server from ever switching
the cursor keys into application mode (where the keys <br>
send slightly different sequences). You probably only need
this if some application is making a nuisance of itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pterm.NoMouseReporting <br>
This option should be set to either 0 or 1; the default is
0. When set to 1, it stops the server from ever enabling
mouse reporting mode (where mouse clicks are sent to <br>
the application instead of controlling cut and paste).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pterm.NoRemoteResize <br>
This option should be set to either 0 or 1; the default is
0. When set to 1, it stops the server from being able to
remotely control the size of the pterm window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pterm.NoAltScreen <br>
This option should be set to either 0 or 1; the default is
0. When set to 1, it stops the server from using the
&lsquo;alternate screen&rsquo; terminal feature, which lets
full-screen <br>
applications leave the screen exactly the way they found
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pterm.NoRemoteWinTitle <br>
This option should be set to either 0 or 1; the default is
0. When set to 1, it stops the server from remotely
controlling the title of the pterm window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pterm.NoRemoteQTitle <br>
This option should be set to either 0 or 1; the default is
1. When set to 1, it stops the server from remotely
requesting the title of the pterm window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This feature is a POTENTIAL
SECURITY HAZARD. If a malicious application can write data
to your terminal (for example, if you merely cat a file
owned by someone else on the <br>
server machine), it can change your window title (unless you
have disabled this using the NoRemoteWinTitle resource) and
then use this service to have the new window title <br>
sent back to the server as if typed at the keyboard. This
allows an attacker to fake keypresses and potentially cause
your server-side applications to do things you didn&rsquo;t
<br>
want. Therefore this feature is disabled by default, and we
recommend you do not turn it on unless you really know what
you are doing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pterm.NoDBackspace <br>
This option should be set to either 0 or 1; the default is
0. When set to 1, it disables the normal action of the
Delete (^?) character when sent from the server to the <br>
terminal, which is to move the cursor left by one space and
erase the character now under it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pterm.ApplicationCursorKeys <br>
This option should be set to either 0 or 1; the default is
0. When set to 1, the default initial state of the cursor
keys are application mode (where the keys send func&acirc;
<br>
tion-key-like sequences instead of numbers or arrow keys).
When set to 0, the default state is the normal one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pterm.ApplicationKeypad <br>
This option should be set to either 0 or 1; the default is
0. When set to 1, the default initial state of the numeric
keypad is application mode (where the keys send func&acirc;
<br>
tion-key-like sequences instead of numbers or arrow keys).
When set to 0, the default state is the normal one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pterm.NetHackKeypad <br>
This option should be set to either 0 or 1; the default is
0. When set to 1, the numeric keypad operates in NetHack
mode. This is equivalent to the -nethack command-line <br>
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pterm.Answerback <br>
This option controls the string which the terminal sends in
response to receiving the ^E character (&lsquo;tell me about
yourself&rsquo;). By default this string is
&lsquo;PuTTY&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pterm.HideMousePtr <br>
This option should be set to either 0 or 1; the default is
0. When it is set to 1, the mouse pointer will disappear if
it is over the pterm window and you press a key. It <br>
will reappear as soon as you move it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pterm.WindowBorder <br>
This option controls the number of pixels of space between
the text in the pterm window and the window frame. The
default is 1. You can increase this value, but decreasing
<br>
it to 0 is not recommended because it can cause the window
manager&rsquo;s size hints to work incorrectly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pterm.CurType <br>
This option should be set to either 0, 1 or 2; the default
is 0. When set to 0, the text cursor displayed in the window
is a rectangular block. When set to 1, the cursor <br>
is an underline; when set to 2, it is a vertical line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pterm.BlinkCur <br>
This option should be set to either 0 or 1; the default is
0. When it is set to 1, the text cursor will blink when the
window is active.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pterm.Beep <br>
This option should be set to either 0 or 2 (yes, 2); the
default is 0. When it is set to 2, pterm will respond to a
bell character (^G) by flashing the window instead of <br>
beeping.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pterm.BellOverload <br>
This option should be set to either 0 or 1; the default is
0. When it is set to 1, pterm will watch out for large
numbers of bells arriving in a short time and will
tempo&acirc; <br>
rarily disable the bell until they stop. The idea is that if
you cat a binary file, the frantic beeping will mostly be
silenced by this feature and will not drive you <br>
crazy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The bell overload mode is
activated by receiving N bells in time T; after a further
time S without any bells, overload mode will turn itself off
again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bell overload mode is always
deactivated by any keypress in the terminal. This means it
can respond to large unexpected streams of data, but does
not interfere with ordi&acirc; <br>
nary command-line activities that generate beeps (such as
filename completion).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pterm.BellOverloadN <br>
This option counts the number of bell characters which will
activate bell overload if they are received within a length
of time T. The default is 5.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pterm.BellOverloadT <br>
This option specifies the time period in which receiving N
or more bells will activate bell overload mode. It is
measured in microseconds, so (for example) set it to <br>
1000000 for one second. The default is 2000000 (two
seconds).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pterm.BellOverloadS <br>
This option specifies the time period of silence required to
turn off bell overload mode. It is measured in microseconds,
so (for example) set it to 1000000 for one sec&acirc; <br>
ond. The default is 5000000 (five seconds of silence).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pterm.ScrollbackLines <br>
This option specifies how many lines of scrollback to save
above the visible terminal screen. The default is 200. This
resource is equivalent to the -sl command-line <br>
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pterm.DECOriginMode <br>
This option should be set to either 0 or 1; the default is
0. It specifies the default state of DEC Origin Mode. (If
you don&rsquo;t know what that means, you probably
don&rsquo;t <br>
need to mess with it.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pterm.AutoWrapMode <br>
This option should be set to either 0 or 1; the default is
1. It specifies the default state of auto wrap mode. When
set to 1, very long lines will wrap over to the next <br>
line on the terminal; when set to 0, long lines will be
squashed against the right-hand edge of the screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pterm.LFImpliesCR <br>
This option should be set to either 0 or 1; the default is
0. When set to 1, the terminal will return the cursor to the
left side of the screen when it receives a line <br>
feed character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pterm.WinTitle <br>
This resource is the same as the -T command-line option: it
controls the initial title of the window. The default is
&lsquo;pterm&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pterm.TermWidth <br>
This resource is the same as the width part of the -geometry
command-line option: it controls the number of columns of
text in the window. The default is 80.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pterm.TermHeight <br>
This resource is the same as the width part of the -geometry
command-line option: it controls the number of columns of
text in the window. The defaults is 24.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pterm.Font <br>
This resource is the same as the -fn command-line option: it
controls the font used to display normal text. The default
is &lsquo;fixed&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pterm.BoldFont <br>
This resource is the same as the -fb command-line option: it
controls the font used to display bold text when
BoldAsColour is set to 0 or 2. The default is unset (the
font <br>
will be bolded by printing it twice at a one-pixel
offset).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pterm.WideFont <br>
This resource is the same as the -fw command-line option: it
controls the font used to display double-width characters.
The default is unset (double-width characters can&acirc;
<br>
not be displayed).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pterm.WideBoldFont <br>
This resource is the same as the -fwb command-line option:
it controls the font used to display double-width characters
in bold, when BoldAsColour is set to 0 or 2. The <br>
default is unset (double-width characters are displayed in
bold by printing them twice at a one-pixel offset).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pterm.ShadowBoldOffset <br>
This resource can be set to an integer; the default is
&acirc;1. It specifies the offset at which text is
overprinted when using &lsquo;shadow bold&rsquo; mode. The
default (1) means that <br>
the text will be printed in the normal place, and also one
character to the right; this seems to work well for most X
bitmap fonts, which have a blank line of pixels down <br>
the right-hand side. For some fonts, you may need to set
this to &acirc;1, so that the text is overprinted one pixel
to the left; for really large fonts, you may want to set it
<br>
higher than 1 (in one direction or the other).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pterm.BoldAsColour <br>
This option should be set to either 0, 1, or 2; the default
is 1. It specifies how bold text should be displayed. When
set to 1, bold text is shown by displaying it in a <br>
brighter colour; when set to 0, bold text is shown by
displaying it in a heavier font; when set to 2, both effects
happen at once (a heavy font and a brighter colour).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pterm.Colour0, pterm.Colour1,
..., pterm.Colour21 <br>
These options control the various colours used to display
text in the pterm window. Each one should be specified as a
triple of decimal numbers giving red, green and blue <br>
values: so that black is &lsquo;0,0,0&rsquo;, white is
&lsquo;255,255,255&rsquo;, red is &lsquo;255,0,0&rsquo; and
so on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Colours 0 and 1 specify the
foreground colour and its bold equivalent (the -fg and -bfg
command-line options). Colours 2 and 3 specify the
background colour and its bold <br>
equivalent (the -bg and -bbg command-line options). Colours
4 and 5 specify the text and block colours used for the
cursor (the -cfg and -cbg command-line options). Each <br>
even number from 6 to 20 inclusive specifies the colour to
be used for one of the ANSI primary colour specifications
(black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, <br>
white, in that order); the odd numbers from 7 to 21
inclusive specify the bold version of each colour, in the
same order. The defaults are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pterm.Colour0: 187,187,187 <br>
pterm.Colour1: 255,255,255 <br>
pterm.Colour2: 0,0,0 <br>
pterm.Colour3: 85,85,85 <br>
pterm.Colour4: 0,0,0 <br>
pterm.Colour5: 0,255,0 <br>
pterm.Colour6: 0,0,0 <br>
pterm.Colour7: 85,85,85 <br>
pterm.Colour8: 187,0,0 <br>
pterm.Colour9: 255,85,85 <br>
pterm.Colour10: 0,187,0 <br>
pterm.Colour11: 85,255,85 <br>
pterm.Colour12: 187,187,0 <br>
pterm.Colour13: 255,255,85 <br>
pterm.Colour14: 0,0,187 <br>
pterm.Colour15: 85,85,255 <br>
pterm.Colour16: 187,0,187 <br>
pterm.Colour17: 255,85,255 <br>
pterm.Colour18: 0,187,187 <br>
pterm.Colour19: 85,255,255 <br>
pterm.Colour20: 187,187,187 <br>
pterm.Colour21: 255,255,255</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pterm.RectSelect <br>
This option should be set to either 0 or 1; the default is
0. When set to 0, dragging the mouse over several lines
selects to the end of each line and from the beginning <br>
of the next; when set to 1, dragging the mouse over several
lines selects a rectangular region. In each case, holding
down Alt while dragging gives the other behaviour.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pterm.MouseOverride <br>
This option should be set to either 0 or 1; the default is
1. When set to 1, if the application requests mouse tracking
(so that mouse clicks are sent to it instead of <br>
doing selection), holding down Shift will revert the mouse
to normal selection. When set to 0, mouse tracking
completely disables selection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pterm.Printer <br>
This option is unset by default. If you set it, then
server-controlled printing is enabled: the server can send
control sequences to request data to be sent to a printer.
<br>
That data will be piped into the command you specify here;
so you might want to set it to &lsquo;lpr&rsquo;, for
example, or &lsquo;lpr -Pmyprinter&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pterm.ScrollBar <br>
This option should be set to either 0 or 1; the default is
1. When set to 0, the scrollbar is hidden (although
Shift-PageUp and Shift-PageDown still work). This is the
<br>
same as the -sb command-line option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pterm.ScrollbarOnLeft <br>
This option should be set to either 0 or 1; the default is
0. When set to 1, the scrollbar will be displayed on the
left of the terminal instead of on the right.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pterm.ScrollOnKey <br>
This option should be set to either 0 or 1; the default is
0. When set to 1, any keypress causes the position of the
scrollback to be reset to the very bottom.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pterm.ScrollOnDisp <br>
This option should be set to either 0 or 1; the default is
1. When set to 1, any activity in the display causes the
position of the scrollback to be reset to the very
bot&acirc; <br>
tom.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pterm.LineCodePage <br>
This option specifies the character set to be used for the
session. This is the same as the -cs command-line
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pterm.NoRemoteCharset <br>
This option disables the terminal&rsquo;s ability to change
its character set when it receives escape sequences telling
it to. You might need to do this to interoperate with <br>
programs which incorrectly change the character set to
something they think is sensible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pterm.BCE <br>
This option should be set to either 0 or 1; the default is
1. When set to 1, the various control sequences that erase
parts of the terminal display will erase in whatever <br>
the current background colour is; when set to 0, they will
erase in black always.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pterm.BlinkText <br>
This option should be set to either 0 or 1; the default is
0. When set to 1, text specified as blinking by the server
will actually blink on and off; when set to 0, pterm <br>
will use the less distracting approach of making the
text&rsquo;s background colour bold.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pterm.StampUtmp <br>
This option should be set to either 0 or 1; the default is
1. When set to 1, pterm will log the login in the various
system log files. This resource is equivalent to the <br>
-ut command-line option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pterm.LoginShell <br>
This option should be set to either 0 or 1; the default is
1. When set to 1, pterm will execute your shell as a login
shell. This resource is equivalent to the -ls com&acirc;
<br>
mand-line option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Most of the X resources have silly names. (Historical
reasons from PuTTY, mostly.)</p>
