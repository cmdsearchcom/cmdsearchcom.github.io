<p>TOMAC(1) General Commands Manual TOMAC(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
tomac - Transmit files to the Mac</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
tomac [ - options ] [ files ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
tomac takes the files specified in tomac and transmits them
to the Mac subject to the options specified. If files also
specifies directories they are followed recursively, and
<br>
all files found will be transmitted. If no files parameter
is specified, binhex reads a MacBinary stream from standard
input and transmits the files found; folder information is
<br>
lost.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
In the absence of any options, tomac takes the specified
files and transmits them to to the Mac using the XMODEM
protocol. Directories named in files are followed
recursively, <br>
all files found will be transmitted. Files are assumed to be
in MacBinary format. However, if the filename ends with
.info the file is assumed to be the info fork of a
MacIn&acirc; <br>
tosh file split amongst more than one file. In that case the
files with .data and .rsrc extensions are also read (if
present). Also, if the info fork is mentioned in the
param&acirc; <br>
eter list, the names of data and resource forks can also be
mentioned, but those will be ignored (this is to allow
wild-card expansion by the shell.) Further, if some form of
<br>
AppleShare is supported by the installed program, and if the
current directory, or one of the directories found during
recursive processing, is a directory in the format of the
<br>
supported version of AppleShare, those files will be handled
according to the properties of AppleShare.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r No intelligent
file-processing is performed; all files named are assumed to
be plain resource files, and are transmitted as if they were
MacIntosh resource files with cre&acirc; <br>
ator &quot;RSED&quot; and type &quot;RSRC&quot;, unless
another creator and/or type are specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d No intelligent
file-processing is performed; all files named are assumed to
be plain data files, and are transmitted as if they were
MacIntosh data files with creator <br>
&quot;MACA&quot; and type &quot;TEXT&quot;, unless another
creator and/or type are specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u As -d, but the codes for CR
and LF are interchanged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U Is a synonym for -u.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c creator <br>
Defines the creator name to be used if one of the previous
options is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t type <br>
Defines the type name to be used if one of the previous
options is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l List every file and directory
processed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i Do not transmit files, give
information only (implies -l.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Ask the user for every
file/directory whether it should be visited (implies
-l.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x Use the XMODEM protocol for
transmission.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-y Use the YMODEM protocol for
transmission (not yet supported.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z Use the ZMODEM protocol for
transmission (not yet supported.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o Use the pre-beta version of
XMODEM.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T Allow for time-out detection
during the protocol. Normally you will not need this option
because on occasion, when network delays do occur, time-out
detection interferes <br>
with a good transmission. Also, when for some reason the
connection is broken the program will normally receive a
hang-up signal and terminate. However, in some situa&acirc;
<br>
tions it might be necessary to early detect time-outs
(because of communication loss or whatever, without loss of
connection). You should check whether use of this option
<br>
has profits in your situation or not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Gives the patchlevel of the
program, and other information. Other options are ignored
and the program quits immediately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H Give short information about
the options. Other options are ignored and the program quits
immediately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
As this is a beta release, there may still be some
problems.</p>
