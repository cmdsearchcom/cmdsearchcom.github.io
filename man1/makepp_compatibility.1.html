The many Perl versions available and still installed on many machines come with
  various subtle bugs. We have tried to work around most of them, but a few
  remain. We have a test suite of around 75 tests, all of which usually pass. On
  some platforms lacking some features, notably Cygwin, a few tests are
  explicitly skipped. This table shows with what version this has been tested
  where, and whether it was successful. We would like to hear of your results on
  other platforms too!
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that you get a comparable overview when going to the top right CPAN tab and
  choosing Perl/Platform Version Matrix
  (&lt;http://matrix.cpantesters.org/?dist=makepp&gt;). But they give a red bar
  even if only one out of about hundred tests fail. And since those test are
  automated on screened off machines, it can be hard to find out or even fix
  what is going wrong. Often it is something that could be worked around, like
  compiler, operating or file system particularities or wrong environment
  variables.

      usable. Perl 5.10.1 has a problem with chmod 0 files, so they can't be
      used to prevent repository imports. In rare cases recent Cygwin also leads
      <i>stat()</i> to report a symlink for an inexistent file. This does not

      Links are emulated by copying while symbolic linking fails. Apparently
      write operations come back before they are visible on disk, which confuses
      makepp about the success of the commands it executes. Six out of 76 tests
      fail due to this. On the bright side, timestamps have a precision of 100
      nanoseconds (though the observed obtainable differences are only about a
      centisecond). This is much better than most older Unix file systems --
      alas Perl's &quot;stat&quot; function has no access to this very welcome
