This program is part of <b>Netpbm</b>(1)
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>pamcomp</b> reads two images and produces a composite image with one of the
  images overlayed on top of the other, possible translucently. The images need
  not be the same size. The input and outputs are Netpbm format image files.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In its simplest use, <b>pamcomp</b> simply places the image in the file
  <i>overlay_file</i> on top of the image in the file <i>underlying_file</i>,
  blocking out the part of <i>underlying_file</i> beneath it.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you add the <b>-alpha</b> option, then <b>pamcomp</b> uses the image in file
  <i>alpha-pgmfile</i> as an alpha mask, which means it determines the level of
  transparency of each point in the overlay image. The alpha mask must have the
  same dimensions as the overlay image. In places where the alpha mask defines
  the overlay image to be opaque, the composite output contains only the
  contents of the overlay image; the underlying image is totally blocked out. In
  places where the alpha mask defines the overlay image to be transparent, the
  composite output contains none of the overlay image; the underlying image
  shows through completely. In places where the alpha mask shows a value in
  between opaque and transparent (translucence), the composite image contains a
  mixture of the overlay image and the underlying image and the level of
  translucence determines how much of each.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The alpha mask is a PGM file in which a white pixel represents opaqueness and a
  black pixel transparency. Anything in between is translucent. (Like any Netpbm
  program, <b>pamcomp</b> will see a PBM file as if it is PGM).
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the overlay image is a PAM image of tuple type RGB_ALPHA or GRAYSCALE_ALPHA,
  then the overlay image contains transparency information itself and
  <b>pamcomp</b> uses it the same way as the alpha mask described above. If you
  supply both an overlay image that has transparency information and an alpha
  mask, <b>pamcomp</b> multiplies the two opacities to get the opacity of the
  overlay pixel.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Before Netpbm 10.25 (October 2004), <b>pamcomp</b> did not recognize the
  transparency information in a PAM image -- it just ignored it. So people had
  to make appropriate alpha masks in order to have a non-opaque overlay. Some
  Netpbm programs that convert from image formats that contain transparency
  information are not able to create RGB_ALPHA or GRAYSCALE_ALPHA PAM output, so
  you have to use the old method -- extract the transparency information from
  the original into a separate alpha mask and use that as input to
  <b>pamcomp</b>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The output image is always of the same dimensions as the underlying image.
  <b>pamcomp</b> uses only parts of the overlay image that fit within the
  underlying image.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The output image is a PAM image. Its tuples are color, grayscale, or black and
  white, whichever is the 'highest' format between the two input images. The
  maxval of the output is the least common multiple of the maxvals of the input,
  up to the maximum possible PAM maxval, 65535.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The output has an opacity channel if and only if the underlying image does, and
  then the opacities are as described under the <b>-mixtransparency</b> option.
  Before Netpbm 10.56 (September 2011), the output never has an opacity channel.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To specify where on the underlying image to place the overlay image, use the
  <b>-align</b>, <b>-valign</b>, <b>-xoff</b>, and <b>-yoff</b> options. Without
  these options, the default horizontal position is flush left and the default
  vertical position is flush top.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The overlay image, in the position you specify, need not fit entirely within the
  underlying image. <b>pamcomp</b> uses only the parts of the overlay image that
  appear above the underlying image. It is possible to specify positioning such
  that <i>none</i> of the overlay image is over the underlying image -- i.e. the
  overlay is out of frame. If you do that, <b>pamcomp</b> issues a warning.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 The overlay and underlying images may be of different formats (e.g. overlaying
  a PBM text image over a full color PPM image) and have different maxvals. The
  output image has the more general of the two input formats and a maxval that
  is the least common multiple the two maxvals (or the maximum maxval allowable
  by the format, if the LCM is more than that).

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-opacity=</b><i>opacity</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This option tells how opaque the overlay image is to be,
      i.e. how much of the composite image should be from the overlay image, as
      opposed to the underlying image. <i>opacity</i> is a floating point
      number, with 1.0 meaning the overlay image is totally opaque and 0.0
      meaning it is totally transparent. The default is 1.0.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If you specify an alpha mask (the <b>-alpha</b> option), <b>pamcomp</b> uses
      the product of the opacity indicated by the alpha mask (as modified by the
      <b>-invert</b> option, as a fraction, and this opacity value. The
      <b>-invert</b> option does not apply to this opacity value.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    As a simple opacity value, the value makes sense only if it is between 0 and
      1, inclusive. However, <b>pamcomp</b> accepts all values and performs the
      same arithmetic computation using whatever value you provide. An opacity
      value less than zero means the underlay image is intensified and then the
      overlay image is &quot;subtracted&quot; from it. An opacity value greater
      than unity means the overlay image is intensified and the underlaying
      image subtracted from it. In either case, <b>pamcomp</b> clips the
      resulting color component intensities so they are nonnegative and don't
      exceed the output image's maxval.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This may seem like a strange thing to do, but it has uses. You can use it to
      brighten or darken or saturate or desaturate areas of the underlaying
      image. See this description (1)
    <br/>
     of the technique.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This option was added in Netpbm 10.6 (July 2002). Before Netpbm 10.15 (April
      2003), values less than zero or greater than unity were not allowed.

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-mixtransparency</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This option controls what <b>pamcomp</b> does where both
      the underlying and overlay image are non-opaque.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    By default, the output image has the same transparency as the underlying
      image and the transparency of the underlying image has no effect on the
      composition of color.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    But with this option, <b>pamcomp</b> composes the image according to a
      plastic transparency metaphor: the underlying and overlay images are
      plastic slides. The output image is the slide you get when you stack up
      those two slides. So the transparency of the output is a combination of
      the transparency of the inputs and the transparency of the underlying
      image affects the underlying image's contribution to the output image's
      color.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Unlike the metaphorical slide, a PAM pixel has a color even where it is
      completely transparent, so <b>pamcomp</b> departs from the metaphor in
      that case and makes the output color identical to the underlying image.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This option was new in Netpbm 10.56 (September 2011). Before that, the
      output is always opaque and the <b>pamcomp</b> ignores the transparency of
      the underlying image.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
  </dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-linear</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This option indicates that the inputs are not true Netpbm
      images but rather a non-gamma-adjusted variation. This is relevant only
      when you mix pixels, using the <b>-opacity</b> option or an alpha mask
      (the <b>-alpha</b> option).
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The alpha mask and <b>-opacity</b> values indicate a fraction of the light
      intensity of a pixel. But the PNM and PNM-equivalent PAM image formats
      represent intensities with gamma-adjusted numbers that are not linearly
      proportional to intensity. So <b>pamcomp</b>, by default, performs a
      calculation on each sample read from its input and each sample written to
      its output to convert between these gamma-adjusted numbers and internal
      intensity-proportional numbers.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Sometimes you are not working with true PNM or PAM images, but rather a
      variation in which the sample values are in fact directly proportional to
      intensity. If so, use the <b>-linear</b> option to tell <b>pamcomp</b>
      this. <b>pamcomp</b> then will skip the conversions.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The conversion takes time. And the difference between intensity-proportional
      values and gamma-adjusted values may be small enough that you would barely
      see a difference in the result if you just pretended that the
      gamma-adjusted values were in fact intensity-proportional. So just to save
      time, at the expense of some image quality, you can specify <b>-linear</b>
      even when you have true PPM input and expect true PPM output.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    For the first 13 years of Netpbm's life, until Netpbm 10.20 (January 2004),
      <b>pamcomp</b>'s predecessor <b>pnmcomp</b> always treated the PPM samples
      as intensity-proportional even though they were not, and drew few
      complaints. So using <b>-linear</b> as a lie is a reasonable thing to do
      if speed is important to you.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Another technique to consider is to convert your PNM image to the linear
      variation with <b>pnmgamma</b>, run <b>pamcomp</b> on it and other
      transformations that like linear PNM, and then convert it back to true PNM
      with <b>pnmgamma -ungamma</b>. <b>pnmgamma</b> is often faster than
      <b>pamcomp</b> in doing the conversion.
