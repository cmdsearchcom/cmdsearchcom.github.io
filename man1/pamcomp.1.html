<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pamcomp - composite (overlay) two Netpbm images together</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pamcomp</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[-align={left|center|right|
beyondleft|beyondright}] [-valign={top|middle|bottom|
above|below}] [-xoff=X] [-yoff=Y] [-alpha=alpha-pgmfile]
[-invert] [-opacity=opacity] [-mix&acirc; <br>
transparency] [-linear] overlay_file [underlying_file
[output_file]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Minimum unique abbreviation of
option is acceptable. You may use double hyphens instead of
single hyphen to denote options. You may use white space in
place of the equals sign <br>
to separate an option name from its value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This program is part of Netpbm(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pamcomp reads two images and
produces a composite image with one of the images overlayed
on top of the other, possible translucently. The images need
not be the same size. The <br>
input and outputs are Netpbm format image files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In its simplest use, pamcomp
simply places the image in the file overlay_file on top of
the image in the file underlying_file, blocking out the part
of underlying_file beneath <br>
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you add the -alpha option,
then pamcomp uses the image in file alpha-pgmfile as an
alpha mask, which means it determines the level of
transparency of each point in the overlay <br>
image. The alpha mask must have the same dimensions as the
overlay image. In places where the alpha mask defines the
overlay image to be opaque, the composite output contains
<br>
only the contents of the overlay image; the underlying image
is totally blocked out. In places where the alpha mask
defines the overlay image to be transparent, the composite
<br>
output contains none of the overlay image; the underlying
image shows through completely. In places where the alpha
mask shows a value in between opaque and transparent <br>
(translucence), the composite image contains a mixture of
the overlay image and the underlying image and the level of
translucence determines how much of each.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The alpha mask is a PGM file in
which a white pixel represents opaqueness and a black pixel
transparency. Anything in between is translucent. (Like any
Netpbm program, pamcomp <br>
will see a PBM file as if it is PGM).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the overlay image is a PAM
image of tuple type RGB_ALPHA or GRAYSCALE_ALPHA, then the
overlay image contains transparency information itself and
pamcomp uses it the same way <br>
as the alpha mask described above. If you supply both an
overlay image that has transparency information and an alpha
mask, pamcomp multiplies the two opacities to get the
opac&acirc; <br>
ity of the overlay pixel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Before Netpbm 10.25 (October
2004), pamcomp did not recognize the transparency
information in a PAM image -- it just ignored it. So people
had to make appropriate alpha masks in <br>
order to have a non-opaque overlay. Some Netpbm programs
that convert from image formats that contain transparency
information are not able to create RGB_ALPHA or <br>
GRAYSCALE_ALPHA PAM output, so you have to use the old
method -- extract the transparency information from the
original into a separate alpha mask and use that as input to
pam&acirc; <br>
comp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The output image is always of
the same dimensions as the underlying image. pamcomp uses
only parts of the overlay image that fit within the
underlying image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The output image is a PAM image.
Its tuples are color, grayscale, or black and white,
whichever is the &rsquo;highest&rsquo; format between the
two input images. The maxval of the output <br>
is the least common multiple of the maxvals of the input, up
to the maximum possible PAM maxval, 65535.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The output has an opacity
channel if and only if the underlying image does, and then
the opacities are as described under the -mixtransparency
option. Before Netpbm 10.56 (Sep&acirc; <br>
tember 2011), the output never has an opacity channel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To specify where on the
underlying image to place the overlay image, use the -align,
-valign, -xoff, and -yoff options. Without these options,
the default horizontal position is <br>
flush left and the default vertical position is flush
top.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The overlay image, in the
position you specify, need not fit entirely within the
underlying image. pamcomp uses only the parts of the overlay
image that appear above the under&acirc; <br>
lying image. It is possible to specify positioning such that
none of the overlay image is over the underlying image --
i.e. the overlay is out of frame. If you do that, pamcomp
<br>
issues a warning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The overlay and underlying
images may be of different formats (e.g. overlaying a PBM
text image over a full color PPM image) and have different
maxvals. The output image has <br>
the more general of the two input formats and a maxval that
is the least common multiple the two maxvals (or the maximum
maxval allowable by the format, if the LCM is more than <br>
that).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-align=alignment <br>
This option selects the basic horizontal position of the
overlay image with respect to the underlying image, in
syntax reminiscent of HTML. left means flush left, center
<br>
means centered, and right means flush right.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -xoff option modifies this
position.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">beyondleft means just out of
frame to the left -- the right edge of the overlay is flush
with the left edge of the underlying image. beyondright
means just out of frame <br>
to the right. These alignments are useful only if you add a
-xoff option. These two values were added in Netpbm 10.10
(October 2002).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is left.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-valign=alignment <br>
This option selects the basic vertical position of the
overlay image with respect to the underlying image, in
syntax reminiscent of HTML. top means flush top, middle <br>
means centered, and bottom means flush bottom.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -yoff option modifies this
position.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">above means just out of frame to
the top -- the bottom edge of the overlay is flush with the
top edge of the underlying image. below means just out of
frame to the bot&acirc; <br>
tom. These alignments are useful only if you add a -yoff
option. These two values were added in Netpbm 10.10 (October
2002).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is top.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-xoff=x <br>
This option modifies the horizontal positioning of the
overlay image with respect to the underlying image as
selected by the -align option. pamcomp shifts the overlay
<br>
image from that basic position x pixels to the right. x can
be negative to indicate shifting to the left.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The overlay need not fit
entirely (or at all) on the underlying image. pamcomp uses
only the parts that lie over the underlying image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Before Netpbm 10.10 (October
2002), -xoff was mutually exclusive with -align and always
measured from the left edge.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-yoff=y <br>
This option modifies the vertical positioning of the overlay
image with respect to the underlying image as selected by
the -valign option. pamcomp shifts the overlay <br>
image from that basic position y pixels downward. y can be
negative to indicate shifting upward.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The overlay need not fit
entirely (or at all) on the underlying image. pamcomp uses
only the parts that lie over the underlying image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Before Netpbm 10.10 (October
2002), -xoff was mutually exclusive with -valign and always
measured from the top edge.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-alpha=alpha-pgmfile <br>
This option names a file that contains the alpha mask. If
you don&rsquo;t specify this option, there is no alpha mask,
which is equivalent to having an alpha mask specify total
<br>
opaqueness everywhere.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can specify - as the value
of this option and the alpha mask will come from Standard
Input. If you do this, don&rsquo;t specify Standard Input as
the source of any other <br>
input image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-invert <br>
This option inverts the sense of the values in the alpha
mask, which effectively switches the roles of the overlay
image and the underlying image in places where the two <br>
intersect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-opacity=opacity <br>
This option tells how opaque the overlay image is to be,
i.e. how much of the composite image should be from the
overlay image, as opposed to the underlying image.
opac&acirc; <br>
ity is a floating point number, with 1.0 meaning the overlay
image is totally opaque and 0.0 meaning it is totally
transparent. The default is 1.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you specify an alpha mask
(the -alpha option), pamcomp uses the product of the opacity
indicated by the alpha mask (as modified by the -invert
option, as a fraction, <br>
and this opacity value. The -invert option does not apply to
this opacity value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As a simple opacity value, the
value makes sense only if it is between 0 and 1, inclusive.
However, pamcomp accepts all values and performs the same
arithmetic computa&acirc; <br>
tion using whatever value you provide. An opacity value less
than zero means the underlay image is intensified and then
the overlay image is &quot;subtracted&quot; from it. An <br>
opacity value greater than unity means the overlay image is
intensified and the underlaying image subtracted from it. In
either case, pamcomp clips the resulting color <br>
component intensities so they are nonnegative and
don&rsquo;t exceed the output image&rsquo;s maxval.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This may seem like a strange
thing to do, but it has uses. You can use it to brighten or
darken or saturate or desaturate areas of the underlaying
image. See this <br>
description (1) <br>
of the technique.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option was added in Netpbm
10.6 (July 2002). Before Netpbm 10.15 (April 2003), values
less than zero or greater than unity were not allowed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mixtransparency <br>
This option controls what pamcomp does where both the
underlying and overlay image are non-opaque.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, the output image has
the same transparency as the underlying image and the
transparency of the underlying image has no effect on the
composition of color.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">But with this option, pamcomp
composes the image according to a plastic transparency
metaphor: the underlying and overlay images are plastic
slides. The output image is <br>
the slide you get when you stack up those two slides. So the
transparency of the output is a combination of the
transparency of the inputs and the transparency of the <br>
underlying image affects the underlying image&rsquo;s
contribution to the output image&rsquo;s color.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unlike the metaphorical slide, a
PAM pixel has a color even where it is completely
transparent, so pamcomp departs from the metaphor in that
case and makes the output <br>
color identical to the underlying image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option was new in Netpbm
10.56 (September 2011). Before that, the output is always
opaque and the pamcomp ignores the transparency of the
underlying image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-linear <br>
This option indicates that the inputs are not true Netpbm
images but rather a non-gamma-adjusted variation. This is
relevant only when you mix pixels, using the -opacity <br>
option or an alpha mask (the -alpha option).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The alpha mask and -opacity
values indicate a fraction of the light intensity of a
pixel. But the PNM and PNM-equivalent PAM image formats
represent intensities with <br>
gamma-adjusted numbers that are not linearly proportional to
intensity. So pamcomp, by default, performs a calculation on
each sample read from its input and each sample <br>
written to its output to convert between these
gamma-adjusted numbers and internal intensity-proportional
numbers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sometimes you are not working
with true PNM or PAM images, but rather a variation in which
the sample values are in fact directly proportional to
intensity. If so, use <br>
the -linear option to tell pamcomp this. pamcomp then will
skip the conversions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The conversion takes time. And
the difference between intensity-proportional values and
gamma-adjusted values may be small enough that you would
barely see a difference <br>
in the result if you just pretended that the gamma-adjusted
values were in fact intensity-proportional. So just to save
time, at the expense of some image quality, you <br>
can specify -linear even when you have true PPM input and
expect true PPM output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For the first 13 years of
Netpbm&rsquo;s life, until Netpbm 10.20 (January 2004),
pamcomp&rsquo;s predecessor pnmcomp always treated the PPM
samples as intensity-proportional even <br>
though they were not, and drew few complaints. So using
-linear as a lie is a reasonable thing to do if speed is
important to you.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another technique to consider is
to convert your PNM image to the linear variation with
pnmgamma, run pamcomp on it and other transformations that
like linear PNM, and <br>
then convert it back to true PNM with pnmgamma -ungamma.
pnmgamma is often faster than pamcomp in doing the
conversion.</p>

ppmmix(1) <br>
and pnmpaste(1) <br>
are simpler, less general versions of the same tool.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ppmcolormask(1) <br>
and pbmmask(1) , and pambackground(1) <br>
can help with generating an alpha mask.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pnmcomp(1) <br>
is an older program that runs faster, but has less
function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pnm(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY <br>
pamcomp was new in Netpbm 10.21 (March 2004). Its
predecessor, pnmcomp, was one of the first programs added to
Netpbm when the project went global in 1993.</p>
