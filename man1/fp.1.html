This binary is the integrated development environment of the <i>Free Pascal
  Compiler (FPC)</i> which is an advanced <i>Turbo Pascal</i> and <i>Delphi
  (7.0)</i> compatible multitarget Pascal compiler. The compiler engine is not
  based on GCC, but is completely standalone.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The compiler uses <b>LD</b>(1) and can use <b>AS</b>(1) (see parameter -Aas),
  but also has its own binary object writer.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The current main targets are <i>Go32V2</i> (Dos DJGPP extender), <i>Freebsd,</i>
  <i>Linux,</i> <i>MacOS,</i> <i>MacOSX,</i> <i>MorphOS,</i> <i>Netware,</i>
  <i>OS/2</i> and <i>Win32.</i> The other targets (M68K compilers for Atari and
  Amiga) are either based on older versions of the compiler or are still in
  development.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This manpage is meant for quick-reference only. FPC comes with a great (2000+
  pages) manual, which is updated constantly, while this man page can be out of
  date.

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Usage"><a class="selflink" href="#Usage">Usage</a></h1>
The user interface of the IDE has been designed to be similar to Turbo Pascal.
  It provides the user with a user friendly, but rather powerful editor, an
  extensive on-line help system and a debugger.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
A text mode windowing system is the base of the user interface. The mouse is
  supported, but most people will use the keyboard. The user will usually open a
  few text editor windows in which he will design his program, during which he
  can regularily check and debug through the use of hot keys. The high speed of
  the compiler ensures that programmers can do this often and therefore allows
  speedy development of code.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Help_files"><a class="selflink" href="#Help_files">Help
  files</a></h1>
No help files are provided by default. The user must download the Free Pascal
  documentation in HTML format and install it into the IDE using the
  Help-&gt;Files menu. Turbo Pascal .tph files can also be installed in this
  menu and can be useful for source code that ships with
  <b>.tph</b>files<b>as</b>documentation.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Character_sets"><a class="selflink" href="#Character_sets">Character
  sets</a></h1>
The IDE has been designed for VGA text mode fonts. These fonts allow visually
  more interresting text modes than the the VT100 fonts normally used on Unix
  systems and also more portable, since most operating systems use VGA character
  sets for their text modes.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
When running on a VT100 compatible terminal, some emulation will occur.
  Internally the IDE will think it is running on a VGA text mode font (most
  likely code page 850), while all characters will (in the case of code page
  850) be converted to Latin-1 and VT100 alternate character set characters.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The Linux console can do VGA fonts and therefore the IDE can be viewed as it was
  intended on it. The Linux console mode supports the all of the VGA character
  set through the /dev/vcsa* devices and most of it through normal escape
  sequences. To prevent bad user experiences, the IDE has been made rather
  aggressive in using VGA character sets. First it will determine the actual
  console number you are running on (even if you run on a pty, like in Midnight
  Commander). Then the IDE will open the /dev/vcsa* device belonging to that
  console. If permission is denied the IDE will call the grab_vcsa utility,
  which is a setuid root utility which will grant permissions to the vcsa
  device.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
In case the vcsa device is not available, the IDE will send escape codes to
  enable the VGA font. In this mode a few characters in the low 32 ascii
  positions are unavailable, but mainly since the full set of line drawing
  characters is available the user will notice few differences.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The Linux frame buffer device and the Free Pascal IDE are an excellent
  combination. With fbdev it is possible to use text mode resolutions higher
  than the normal 80x25, which allows the programmer to see a lot more code at a
  time.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The Linux console allows the user to load user defined fonts. If you do this,
  such a font must have a VGA styled layout, i.e. code page 437/850/... (Note
  that this does not mean your file system has to use such an encoding, the
  Linux console handles the conversion from ISO-8859-1, UTF-8 or whatever to the
  font.) Since the default fonts have a code page 437 layout, only users that
  have experimented with fonts will have to take care here.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The IDE recognizes the environment variable CONSOLEFONT_CP in which you can
  specify the code page of the console font. Recognized values are currently
  &quot;cp437&quot; and &quot;cp850&quot;. If you do not set this variable code
  page 437 will be assumed. Currently, if you use code page 850 without setting
  the variable there won't be a huge impact at this time, the characters that
  the IDE uses exist in both code pages.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Note: KOI8-R/KOI8-U fonts have all required characters, but the line drawing
  characters are not in the right positions. We may support this in the future,
  but currently do not.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Keyboard"><a class="selflink" href="#Keyboard">Keyboard</a></h1>
Unix keyboard handling is a complicated matter because not all key combinations
  generate escape codes, different terminal emulators generate different escape
  codes, and some key combinations may trigger actions in the X11 Window
  manager.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Because the Free Pascal IDE's user interface is designed to be similar to Turbo
  Pascal, including keyboard commands, you may experience one of the above
  situations. Some alternative keys have been added, and perhaps more will have
  to be added in the future.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
When running on the Linux console, the keyboard is reprogrammed for full
  functionality.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Here are some common problems you may encounter and possible work-arounds:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>Problem:</b> Selecting text with shift+arrow keys does not work.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>Solution:</b> Use the mouse
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>Solution:</b> Use &quot;ctrl+k b&quot; to mark start of block,&quot;ctrl+k
  e&quot; to mark end of block, &quot;ctrl+k h&quot; to hide the block.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>Problem:</b> Cut/Copy/Paste keys do not work.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>Solution:</b> Go to Options-&gt;Environment-&gt;Keyboard &amp; mouse and
  enable the Microsoft styled Cut/Copy/Paste keys.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>Solution:</b> Use the menu bar.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>Problem:</b> Alt key does not work.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>Solution:</b> Press Escape first, then the key without alt. Note that this is
  not possible on the Linux console, but the Alt key does work there.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If for whatever reason the reprogrammed Linux console keyboard is not restored
  to the original state after exit (IDE crash?), you can do something like
  &quot;/etc/init.d/kbd start&quot; to reprogram it into its normal behaviour.
