<p>fp(1) Free Pascal IDE fp(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
fp - Free Pascal Compiler (FPC) integrated development
environment</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
fp [options] [sourcefile]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This binary is the integrated development environment of the
Free Pascal Compiler (FPC) which is an advanced Turbo Pascal
and Delphi (7.0) compatible multitarget Pascal compiler.
<br>
The compiler engine is not based on GCC, but is completely
standalone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The compiler uses LD(1) and can
use AS(1) (see parameter -Aas), but also has its own binary
object writer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The current main targets are
Go32V2 (Dos DJGPP extender), Freebsd, Linux, MacOS, MacOSX,
MorphOS, Netware, OS/2 and Win32. The other targets (M68K
compilers for Atari and Amiga) <br>
are either based on older versions of the compiler or are
still in development.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This manpage is meant for
quick-reference only. FPC comes with a great (2000+ pages)
manual, which is updated constantly, while this man page can
be out of date.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Usage <br>
The user interface of the IDE has been designed to be
similar to Turbo Pascal. It provides the user with a user
friendly, but rather powerful editor, an extensive on-line
help <br>
system and a debugger.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A text mode windowing system is
the base of the user interface. The mouse is supported, but
most people will use the keyboard. The user will usually
open a few text editor win&acirc; <br>
dows in which he will design his program, during which he
can regularily check and debug through the use of hot keys.
The high speed of the compiler ensures that programmers can
<br>
do this often and therefore allows speedy development of
code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Help files <br>
No help files are provided by default. The user must
download the Free Pascal documentation in HTML format and
install it into the IDE using the Help-&gt;Files menu. Turbo
Pascal <br>
.tph files can also be installed in this menu and can be
useful for source code that ships with
.tphfilesasdocumentation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Character sets <br>
The IDE has been designed for VGA text mode fonts. These
fonts allow visually more interresting text modes than the
the VT100 fonts normally used on Unix systems and also more
<br>
portable, since most operating systems use VGA character
sets for their text modes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When running on a VT100
compatible terminal, some emulation will occur. Internally
the IDE will think it is running on a VGA text mode font
(most likely code page 850), while all <br>
characters will (in the case of code page 850) be converted
to Latin-1 and VT100 alternate character set characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Linux console can do VGA
fonts and therefore the IDE can be viewed as it was intended
on it. The Linux console mode supports the all of the VGA
character set through the <br>
/dev/vcsa* devices and most of it through normal escape
sequences. To prevent bad user experiences, the IDE has been
made rather aggressive in using VGA character sets. First it
<br>
will determine the actual console number you are running on
(even if you run on a pty, like in Midnight Commander). Then
the IDE will open the /dev/vcsa* device belonging to that
<br>
console. If permission is denied the IDE will call the
grab_vcsa utility, which is a setuid root utility which will
grant permissions to the vcsa device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In case the vcsa device is not
available, the IDE will send escape codes to enable the VGA
font. In this mode a few characters in the low 32 ascii
positions are unavailable, but <br>
mainly since the full set of line drawing characters is
available the user will notice few differences.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Linux frame buffer device
and the Free Pascal IDE are an excellent combination. With
fbdev it is possible to use text mode resolutions higher
than the normal 80x25, which <br>
allows the programmer to see a lot more code at a time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Linux console allows the
user to load user defined fonts. If you do this, such a font
must have a VGA styled layout, i.e. code page 437/850/...
(Note that this does not mean <br>
your file system has to use such an encoding, the Linux
console handles the conversion from ISO-8859-1, UTF-8 or
whatever to the font.) Since the default fonts have a code
page <br>
437 layout, only users that have experimented with fonts
will have to take care here.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The IDE recognizes the
environment variable CONSOLEFONT_CP in which you can specify
the code page of the console font. Recognized values are
currently &quot;cp437&quot; and &quot;cp850&quot;. If <br>
you do not set this variable code page 437 will be assumed.
Currently, if you use code page 850 without setting the
variable there won&rsquo;t be a huge impact at this time,
the char&acirc; <br>
acters that the IDE uses exist in both code pages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: KOI8-R/KOI8-U fonts have
all required characters, but the line drawing characters are
not in the right positions. We may support this in the
future, but currently do not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Keyboard <br>
Unix keyboard handling is a complicated matter because not
all key combinations generate escape codes, different
terminal emulators generate different escape codes, and some
key <br>
combinations may trigger actions in the X11 Window
manager.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Because the Free Pascal
IDE&rsquo;s user interface is designed to be similar to
Turbo Pascal, including keyboard commands, you may
experience one of the above situations. Some alter&acirc;
<br>
native keys have been added, and perhaps more will have to
be added in the future.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When running on the Linux
console, the keyboard is reprogrammed for full
functionality.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here are some common problems
you may encounter and possible work-arounds:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Problem: Selecting text with
shift+arrow keys does not work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Solution: Use the mouse</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Solution: Use &quot;ctrl+k
b&quot; to mark start of block,&quot;ctrl+k e&quot; to mark
end of block, &quot;ctrl+k h&quot; to hide the block.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Problem: Cut/Copy/Paste keys do
not work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Solution: Go to
Options-&gt;Environment-&gt;Keyboard &amp; mouse and enable
the Microsoft styled Cut/Copy/Paste keys.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Solution: Use the menu bar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Problem: Alt key does not
work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Solution: Press Escape first,
then the key without alt. Note that this is not possible on
the Linux console, but the Alt key does work there.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If for whatever reason the
reprogrammed Linux console keyboard is not restored to the
original state after exit (IDE crash?), you can do something
like &quot;/etc/init.d/kbd start&quot; to <br>
reprogram it into its normal behaviour.</p>
