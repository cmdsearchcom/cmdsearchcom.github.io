<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
ra6 allows the assessment of IPv6 implementations with
respect to a variety of attacks based on ICMPv6 Router
Advertisement messages. This tool is part of the SI6
Networks&rsquo; IPv6 <br>
Toolkit: a security assessment suite for the IPv6
protocols.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This tool has two modes of
operation: active and passive. In active mode, the tool
attacks a specific target, while in passive mode the tool
listens to traffic on the local net&acirc; <br>
work, and launches an attack in response to such traffic.
Active mode is employed when an Ethernet destination address
and/or an IPv6 destination address are specified. Passive
<br>
mode is employed when the &quot;-L&quot; option (or its long
variant &quot;--listen&quot;) is specified. In passive mode,
the ra6 tool listens for incoming Router Solicitation
messages and responds <br>
with the Router Advertisement attack messages. If both a
destination address and the &quot;-L&quot; option are
specified, the tool firstly employs active mode to attack
the specified tar&acirc; <br>
get, and then enters passive mode to respond to Router
Solicitation messages with Router Advertisement attack
packets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
ra6 takes its parameters as command-line options. Each of
the options can be specified with a short name (one
character preceded with the hyphen character, as e.g.
&quot;-i&quot;) or with <br>
a long name (a string preceded with two hyphen characters,
as e.g. &quot;--interface&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Depending on the amount of
information (i.e., options and option data) to be conveyed
into the Router Advertisements, it may be necessary for ra6
to split that information into <br>
more than one Router Advertisement message. This may be
particularly the case when the &quot;flood-prefixes&quot;,
&quot;--flood-routes&quot;, or &quot;--flood-dns&quot;
options are used. Also, when the ra6 <br>
tool is instructed to flood the victim with Router
Advertisements from different sources
(&quot;--flood-sources&quot; option), multiple packets may
need to be generated. ra6 supports IPv6 <br>
fragmentation, which may be of use if a large amount of
information needs to be conveyed within a single Router
Advertisement message. IPv6 fragmentation is not enabled by
<br>
default, and must be explicitly enabled with the
&quot;-y&quot; option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The tool supports filtering of
incoming Router Solicitation messages based on the Ethernet
Source Address, the Ethernet Destination Address, the IPv6
Source Address, and the IPv6 <br>
Destination Address. There are two types of filters:
&quot;block filters&quot; and &quot;accept filters&quot;. If
any &quot;block filter&quot; is specified, and the incoming
Router Solicitation message <br>
matches any of those filters, the message is discarded (and
thus no Router Advertisements are sent in response). If any
&quot;accept filter&quot; is specified, incoming Router
Solicitation <br>
messages must match the specified filters in order for the
ra6 tool to respond with Router Advertisement messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i INTERFACE, --interface
INTERFACE <br>
This option specifies the network interface that the tool
will use. If the destination address (&quot;-d&quot; option)
is a link-local address, or the &quot;listening&quot;
(&quot;-L&quot;) mode is <br>
selected, the interface must be explicitly specified. The
interface may also be specified along with a destination
address, with the &quot;-d&quot; option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s SRC_ADDR, --src-address
SRC_ADDR</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option specifies the IPv6
Source Address (or IPv6 prefix) to be used for the Router
Advertisement messages. If left unspecified, a randomized
link-local unicast <br>
(fe80::/64) address is selected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d DST_ADDR, --dst-address
DST_ADDR</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This specifies the IPv6
Destination Address of the Router Advertisement messages. If
this option is left unspecified, but the Ethernet
Destination Address is specified, <br>
the &quot;all-nodes link-local multicast&quot; address
(ff02::1) is selected as the IPv6 Destination Address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When operating in passive mode
(&quot;-L&quot; option), the IPv6 Destination Address is
selected according to the IPv6 Source Address of the Router
Solicitation message. If the IPv6 <br>
Source Address of the Router Solicitation is the unspecified
address (::), the &quot;all-nodes link-local multicast&quot;
address (ff02::1) is used as the IPv6 Destination Address.
<br>
Otherwise, the IPv6 Source Address of the incoming Router
Solicitation message is used as the IPv6 Destination Address
of the outgoing Router Advertisement messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--hop-limit, -A</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option specifies the Hop
Limit of the Router Advertisement messages. It defaults to
255. Note that IPv6 nodes are required to check that the Hop
Limit of incoming <br>
Router Advertisement messages is 255. Therefore, this option
is only useful to assess whether an IPv6 implementation
fails to enforce the aforementioned check.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-y SIZE, --frag-hdr SIZE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option specifies that the
resulting packet must be fragmented. The fragment size must
be specified as an argument to this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u HDR_SIZE, --dst-opt-hdr
HDR_SIZE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option specifies that a
Destination Options header is to be included in the
resulting packet. The extension header size must be
specified as an argument to this <br>
option (the header is filled with padding options). Multiple
Destination Options headers may be specified by means of
multiple &quot;-u&quot; options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U HDR_SIZE, --dst-opt-u-hdr
HDR_SIZE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option specifies a
Destination Options header to be included in the
&quot;unfragmentable part&quot; of the resulting packet. The
header size must be specified as an argument to <br>
this option (the header is filled with padding options).
Multiple Destination Options headers may be specified by
means of multiple &quot;-U&quot; options. This option is
only valid <br>
if the &quot;-y&quot; option is specified (as the concept of
&quot;unfragmentable part&quot; only makes sense when
fragmentation is employed).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H HDR_SIZE, --hbh-opt-hdr
HDR_SIZE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option specifies that a
Hop-by-Hop Options header is to be included in the resulting
packet. The header size must be specified as an argument to
this option (the <br>
header is filled with padding options). Multiple Hop-by-Hop
Options headers may be specified by means of multiple
&quot;-H&quot; options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--curhop, -c</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option specifies the CurHop
value that is included in Router Advertisement messages.
This is the value that nodes should use for the &quot;Hop
Limit&quot; field of the IPv6 <br>
packets they send. If this option is not specified, the
CurHop value defaults to 255.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--lifetime, -t</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option specifies the Router
Lifetime value that is included in Router Advertisement
messages. The Router Lifetime is the amount of time (in
seconds) that the router <br>
can be used as a &quot;default router&quot;. If this option
is left unspecified, a Router Lifetime value of 9000 seconds
is selected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--reachable, -r</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option specifies the
Reachable Time value that is included in Router
Advertisement messages. The Router Lifetime is the amount of
time in milliseconds that a neighbor <br>
is considered &quot;reachable&quot; after a reachability
confirmation. If this option is left unspecified, a
Reachable Time of 0xffffffff (&quot;infinity&quot;) is
selected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--retrans, -x</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option specifies the
Retrans Timer value that is included in Router Advertisement
messages. The Retrans Timer specifies the amount of time in
milliseconds between <br>
retransmitted Neighbor Solicitation messages (with
&acirc;0&acirc; meaning &quot;unspecified by this
router&quot;). If this option is left unspecified, a Retrans
Timer of 4000 milliseconds is <br>
selected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--managed, -m</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option causes the ra6 tool
to set the &acirc;M&acirc; (Managed) bit in the Router
Advertisement messages that it sends. The &acirc;M&acirc;
bit indicates that network configuration is &quot;man&acirc;
<br>
aged&quot; (e.g., DHCPv6 should be used instead). If left
unspecified, the &acirc;M&acirc; bit is not set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--other, -o</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option causes the ra6 tool
to set the &acirc;O&acirc; (&quot;Other&quot;) bit in the
Router Advertisement messages that it sends. The
&acirc;O&acirc; bit indicates that additional configuration
infor&acirc; <br>
mation is available through other means (e.g., DHCPv6). If
left unspecified, the &acirc;O&acirc; bit is not set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--home-agent, -a</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option causes the ra6 tool
to set the &acirc;H&acirc; (&quot;Home Agent&quot;) bit in
the Router Advertisement messages that it sends (the
&acirc;H&acirc; bit is specified in RFC 3775). If this <br>
option is left unspecified, the &acirc;H&acirc; bit is not
set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--nd-proxy, -q</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option causes the ra6 tool
to set the &acirc;P&acirc; (&quot;ND Proxy&quot;) bit in the
Router Advertisement messages that it sends (the
&quot;P&quot; bit is specified in RFC4389). If this option
is <br>
left unspecified, the &acirc;P&acirc; bit is not set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--preference, -p</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option specifies the
Preference field of the Router Advertisement messages, with
&quot;1&quot; meaning &quot;High&quot;, &quot;0&quot;
meaning &quot;Normal&quot;, and &quot;-1&quot; meaning
&quot;low&quot; (the value &quot;-2&quot; is <br>
forbidden). If left unspecified, a Preference value of
&quot;1&quot; (High) is selected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S SRC_LINK_ADDR,
--src-link-address SRC_LINK_ADDR</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option specifies the
link-layer Source Address of the Router Advertisement
messages (this option is only valid for Ethernet
interfaces). If left unspecified, the <br>
link-layer Source Address is randomized.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When operating in passive mode,
the link-layer Source Address is selected according to the
IPv6 Destination Address of the incoming Router Solicitation
messages. If the <br>
IPv6 Destination Address of the incoming Router Solicitation
message is a multicast address (usually the
&quot;all-routers link-local multicast&quot; address
&quot;ff02::02&quot;), the <br>
link-layer Source Address is set to the address specified by
the &quot;-S&quot; option (or to a random address if the
&quot;-S&quot; option was left unspecified). If the IPv6
Destination <br>
Address of the incoming Router Solicitation is not a
multicast address (i.e., it is a unicast address), the
link-layer Source Address is set to the Ethernet Destination
<br>
Address of the incoming Router Solicitation message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D DST_LINK_ADDR,
--dst-link-address DST_LINK_ADDR</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is meant to specify
the link-layer Destination Address of the Router
Advertisement messages (this option is only valid for
Ethernet interfaces). If left <br>
unspecified, it is set to &quot;33:33:00:00:00:01&quot; (the
Ethernet multicast address corresponding to the IPv6
&quot;all-nodes link-local multicast&quot; address).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When operating in passive mode,
the link-layer Destination Address is set depending to the
IPv6 Source Address of the incoming Router Solicitation
message. If the IPv6 <br>
Source Address of the incoming Router Solicitation message
is the unspecified address (::), the link-layer destination
address is set to &quot;33:33:00:00:00:01&quot; (the
Ethernet <br>
multicast address corresponding to the IPv6 &quot;all-nodes
link-local multicast&quot; address). Otherwise, the
link-layer Destination Address is set to the same value as
the <br>
link-layer Source Address of the incoming Router
Solicitation message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--source-lla-opt, -E</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option specifies the
contents of a source link-layer address option to be
included in the Router Advertisement messages. If a single
option is specified, it is <br>
included in all the outgoing Router Advertisement messages.
If more than one source link-layer address is specified,
they are included only in the first packet of a set of <br>
Router Advertisements (if more than one Router Advertisement
needs to be sent in order to convey all the specified
information).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--add-slla-opt, -e</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option instructs the ra6
tool to include a source link-layer address option in the
Router Advertisement messages. The link-layer address
included in the option is the <br>
same as the Ethernet Source Address used for the outgoing
Router Advertisement message. The difference between this
option and the &quot;-E&quot; option is that the latter does
not <br>
specify the actual value of the option, but just instructs
the tool include the option (the actual value of the option
is selected according to the Ethernet Source address <br>
used in the outgoing packet).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--prefix-opt, -P</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option specifies the
contents of a Prefix Information option to be included in
Router advertisement messages, with the following format:
&quot;-P pre&acirc; <br>
fix/length#flags#valid#preferred&quot;. Where
&quot;prefix/length&quot; is a mandatory field that
indicates an IPv6 prefix (e.g., &quot;2001::/16&quot;).
&quot;flags&quot; is an optional argument that indi&acirc;
<br>
cates which flags should be set for this prefix
(&acirc;L&acirc; for the &quot;on-link&quot; flag,
&acirc;A&acirc; for the &quot;autonomous
address-configuration&quot; flag, &acirc;R&acirc; for
&quot;Router Address&quot;, and &acirc;-&acirc; for <br>
indicating that no flags should be set for this prefix) --
if this field is left unspecified, the &quot;L&quot; and
&quot;A&quot; flags are set for in the specified Prefix
Information option. <br>
&quot;valid&quot; is an optional field that indicates the
&quot;Valid Lifetime&quot; for this prefix (the length of
time in seconds during which this information can be used
for on-link <br>
determination. If left unspecified, a value of 0xffffffff
(infinity) is used. &quot;preferred&quot; is an optional
argument that specifies the &quot;Preferred Lifetime&quot;
value for this <br>
prefix (the length of time in seconds that addresses
generated from this prefix via stateless address
auto-configuration remain preferred). If left unspecified, a
value of <br>
0xffffffff (infinity) is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--route-opt, -R</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option specifies the
contents of a Route Information option to be included in
Router advertisement messages, with the following format:
&quot;-R prefix/length#prefer&acirc; <br>
ence#lifetime&quot;. Where &quot;prefix/length&quot; is a
mandatory field that indicates an IPv6 prefix (e.g.,
&quot;2001::/16&quot;). &quot;preference&quot; is an
optional argument that indicates the pref&acirc; <br>
erence of this prefix (with &acirc;1&acirc; meaning
&quot;high&quot;, &acirc;0&acirc; meaning
&quot;normal&quot;, &acirc;-1&acirc; meaning
&quot;low&quot;, and &acirc;-2&acirc; being an invalid
value). If this field is left unspecified, a value of <br>
&acirc;1&acirc; (i.e., &quot;high&quot;) is selected.
&quot;lifetime&quot; is an optional parameter that specifies
the &quot;Route Lifetime&quot; for the specified route (the
period of time during which this <br>
information can be used for route determination). If left
unspecified, a value of 0xffffffff (infinity) is
selected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--mtu-opt, -M</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is meant to specify
the value of a MTU option that should be included in Router
Advertisements. Multiple MTU options can be specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--rdnss-opt, -N</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option allows the
advertisement of a number of recursive DNS servers by means
of the RDNSS option. A &quot;Lifetime&quot; parameter (32
bits) indicates the amount of time (in <br>
seconds) that the specified DNS server(s) may be used for
name resolution. Multiple IPv6 addresses can be specified in
the same RDNSS option in the form &quot;--dns-opt
life&acirc; <br>
time#ipv6address1#ipv6address2&quot;. Also, more than one
RDNSS option may be specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--flood-prefixes, -f</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option instructs the ra6
tool to flood the victim host with Prefix information
options. The number of Prefix Information options to be sent
is specified as &quot;-f num&acirc; <br>
ber&quot;. When this option is specified, a &quot;-P&quot;
option must be specified (with the usual syntax &quot;-P
prefix/length#flags#valid#preferred&quot;), such that it
instructs ra6 about how <br>
to generate the Prefix Information options. The
&quot;prefix/length&quot; specifies the length of the
prefixes that will be included in each Prefix Information
option. While the <br>
prefix length will be constant for all options, the actual
prefix will be randomized. The rest of the parameters will
be shared by all the prefixes, and have the same <br>
&quot;defaults&quot; as indicated in the description of the
&quot;-P&quot; option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--flood-sources, -F</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option instructs the tool
to send Router Advertisement messages from multiple
addresses. The number of different sources is specified as
&quot;-F number&quot;. The Source <br>
Address of each Router Advertisement is randomly selected
from the prefix specified by the &quot;-s&quot; option. If
the &quot;-F&quot; option is specified but the
&quot;-s&quot; option is left unspec&acirc; <br>
ified, the Source Address of the packets is randomly
selected from the prefix fe80::/64 (link-local unicast). It
should be noted that hosts are required to discard Router
<br>
Advertisement messages that do not have a link-local unicast
address as the Source Address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--flood-routes, -w</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option instructs the ra6
tool to flood the target with Route Information options. The
number of Route Information options to be sent is specified
as &quot;-R number&quot;. When <br>
this option is specified, a &quot;-R&quot; option should be
specified (with the usual syntax &quot;-R
prefix/length#preference#lifetime&quot;) such that ra6 is
instructed about how to gener&acirc; <br>
ate the Route Information options. The
&quot;prefix/length&quot; species the length of the prefixes
that will be included in each Route Information option.
While the prefix length <br>
will be constant for all options, the actual prefix will be
randomized. The rest of the parameters are shared by all the
the options, and have the same &quot;default values&quot;
<br>
as indicated in the description of the &quot;-R&quot;
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--flood-dns, -W</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option instructs the ra6
tool to flood the target with random IPv6 addresses
(supposed to correspond to recursive DNS servers), by means
of the Recursive DNS Server <br>
(RDNSS) option. The number of IPv6 addresses that are to be
sent to the target is specified as &quot;-k number&quot;. As
there is a limit in the number of IPv6 addresses that can be
<br>
included in a RDNSS option, it may be necessary for the tool
to split those addresses into several RDNSS options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is possible to instruct the
ra6 about the maximum number of IPv6 addresses that each
RDNSS option should contain, by means of a second (and
optional) parameter to the <br>
&quot;-k&quot; option. Namely, the tool can be instructed to
send a total number of addresses
(&quot;totaladdresses&quot;) with up to some specific number
(&quot;addrsperoption&quot;) of addresses per <br>
RDNSS option in the form &quot;-k
totaladresses#addrsperoption&quot;. This might be helpful if
it is believed that the target implementation enforces a
limit on the number of <br>
addresses it honors on a &quot;per RNDSS option&quot; basis,
but no limit on the aggregate number of addresses. In such a
case, an implementation might e.g. survive the attack
&quot;-k <br>
5000&quot;, but still be vulnerable to the attack &quot;-k
5000#3&quot;). The &quot;Lifetime&quot; value for these
addresses can be specified by issuing a &quot;-N&quot;
option with the desired &quot;Lifetime&quot; <br>
(this is analogous to how the &quot;--flood-routes&quot;
operates together with the &quot;-R&quot; option, and how
the &quot;--flood-prefixes&quot; operates together with the
&quot;-P&quot; option).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--block-src, -j</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option sets a block filter
for the incoming Router Solicitation messages based on their
IPv6 Source Address. It allows the specification of an IPv6
prefix in the form <br>
&quot;-j prefix/prefixlen&quot;. If the prefix length is not
specified, a prefix length of &quot;/128&quot; is selected
(i.e., the option assumes that a single IPv6 address, rather
than an <br>
IPv6 prefix, has been specified).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--block-dst, -k</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option sets a block filter
for the incoming Router Solicitation messages, based on
their IPv6 Destination Address. It allows the specification
of an IPv6 prefix in <br>
the form &quot;-k prefix/prefixlen&quot;. If the prefix
length is not specified, a prefix length of &quot;/128&quot;
is selected (i.e., the option assumes that a single IPv6
address, rather <br>
than an IPv6 prefix, has been specified).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--block-link-src, -J</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option sets a block filter
for the incoming Router Solicitation messages, based on
their link-layer Source Address. The option must be followed
by a link-layer <br>
address (this option is only valid for Ethernet
interfaces).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--block-link-dst, -K</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option sets a block filter
for the incoming Router Solicitation messages, based on
their link-layer Destination Address. The option must be
followed by a link-layer <br>
address (this option is only valid for Ethernet
interfaces).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--accept-src, -b</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option sets an accept
filter for the incoming Router Solicitation messages, based
on their IPv6 Source Address. It allows the specification of
an IPv6 prefix in the <br>
form &quot;-b prefix/prefixlen&quot;. If the prefix length
is not specified, a prefix length of &quot;/128&quot; is
selected (i.e., the option assumes that a single IPv6
address, rather than <br>
an IPv6 prefix, has been specified).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--accept-dst, -g</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option sets a accept filter
for the incoming Router Solicitation messages, based on
their IPv6 Destination Address. It allows the specification
of an IPv6 prefix in <br>
the form &quot;-g prefix/prefixlen&quot;. If the prefix
length is not specified, a prefix length of &quot;/128&quot;
is selected (i.e., the option assumes that a single IPv6
address, rather <br>
than an IPv6 prefix, has been specified).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--accept-link-src, -B</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option sets an accept
filter for the incoming Router Solicitation messages, based
on their link-layer Source Address. The option must be
followed by a link-layer <br>
address (this option is only valid for Ethernet
interfaces).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--accept-link-dst, -K</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option sets an accept
filter for the incoming Router Solicitation messages, based
on their link-layer Destination Address. The option must be
followed by a link-layer <br>
address (this option is only valid for Ethernet
interfaces).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--loop, -l</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option instructs the ra6
tool to send periodic Router Advertisements to the
destination node. The amount of time to pause between
sending Router Advertisements can be <br>
specified by means of the &quot;-z&quot; option, and
defaults to 1 second. Note that this option cannot be set in
conjunction with the &quot;-L&quot; (&quot;--listen&quot;)
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--sleep, -z</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option specifies the amount
of time to pause between sending Router Advertisements. If
left unspecified, it defaults to 1 second.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--listen, -L</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option specifies that the
tool should enter the &quot;passive&quot; mode (possibly
after operating in active mode, if the &acirc;-d&acirc; or
&acirc;-D&acirc; options were specified).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--verbose, -v</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option instructs the ra6
tool to be verbose.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help, -h</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Print help information for the
ra6 tool.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
The following sections illustrate typical use cases of the
ra6 tool.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example #1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># ra6 -i eth0 -P 2001::/64#LA -P
2002::/64#A -e -L</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Listen (&quot;-L&quot;) for
incoming Router Solicitations on interface eth0 (&quot;-i
eth0&quot;), and advertise the prefix 2001::/64 for both
on-link determination and auto-configuration (&quot;-P <br>
2001::/64#LA&quot;) and the prefix 2002::/64 only for
auto-configuration (&quot;-P 2002::/64#A&quot;). Include a
source link-layer address option (&quot;-e&quot;) in the
Router Advertisements.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example #2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># ra6 -i eth0 -d fe80::1 -D
01:02:03:04:05:06 -c 5 --lifetime 100 -o -e -M 1400</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use the network interface
&quot;eth0&quot; to send a Router Advertisement using a
random link-local IPv6 Source Address and a random Ethernet
Source Address, to the IPv6 Destination <br>
address fe80::1 and the Ethernet Destination Address
01:02:03:04:05:06. The Router Advertisement includes a
&quot;Router Lifetime&quot; of 100, and advertises a CurHop
value of 5 (i.e., a <br>
recommended &quot;Hop Limit&quot; of &quot;5&quot;). The
&acirc;O&acirc; bit is set (thus indicating that other
configuration information is available via DHCP). The Router
Advertisement includes a source <br>
link-layer address option (containing the same address as
the Ethernet Source Address of the packet) and an MTU option
with a value of 1400.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example #3</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># ra6 -i eth0 --flood-sources 10
--flood-routes 50 --flood-prefixes 40 -R ::/64#1 -P ::/48#LA
-L -e</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Listen for incoming Router
Solicitation messages on the interface &quot;eth0&quot;, and
respond with Router Advertisements from 10 different
link-local unicast IPv6 Source Addresses (ran&acirc; <br>
domized) and 10 different (randomized) Ethernet Source
Addresses. Each Router Advertisement includes 50 Route
Information options, each of them with a randomized /64
prefix and a <br>
preference of 1 (&quot;high&quot;). The Router
Advertisements also contain 40 Prefix Information options,
each with a randomized /48 prefix and the &acirc;A&acirc;
(auto-configuration) and &acirc;L&acirc; (on- <br>
link determination) bits set. In addition, each Router
Advertisement includes a source link-layer address option,
containing the same (randomized) address as that used for
the <br>
Ethernet Source Address field.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example #4</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># ra6 -i eth0 -N
1000#fe80::1#2001:db8::1 -L</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Listen for incoming Router
Solicitation messages, and respond with a Router
Advertisement that contains one RDNSS option with two IPv6
addresses (fe80::1 and 2001:db8::1), with a <br>
Lifetime of &quot;1000&quot;. All Router Solicitation
messages sent to multicast addresses will be responded using
the same (randomized) IPv6 Source Address and the same
(randomized) Eth&acirc; <br>
ernet Source Address. Router Solicitation messages destined
to unicast addresses will be responded with Router
Advertisements using the IPv6 Destination Address and the
Ethernet <br>
Destination Address of the incoming Router Solicitation
message for the IPv6 Source Address and the Ethernet Source
Address of the Router Advertisement, respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example #5</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># ra6 -i eth0 -s fe80::1234 -S
00:01:02:03:04:05 -d fe80::1 -N 900 --flood-dns 1000#10
-L</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Flood the target (fe80::1) with
1000 random IPv6 addresses of Recursive DNS Servers, with a
maximum of 10 addresses per RDNSS option. Each RDNSS option
has a &quot;Lifetime&quot; of 900. <br>
Packets are sent with an IPv6 Source Address of
&quot;fe80::1234&quot; and an Ethernet Source Address of
&quot;00:01:02:03:04:05&quot;. Once the target has been
attacked, listen for incoming Router <br>
Solicitation messages and respond with the same
&quot;flood&quot; packets (the Ethernet Source Address and
the IPv6 Source Address will change if the Router
Solicitation messages have been <br>
sent to a unicast address, though).</p>
