gpsctl can switch a dual-mode GPS between NMEA and vendor-binary modes. It can
  also be used to set the device baudrate. Note: Not all devices have these
  capabilities.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you have only one GPS attached to your machine, and gpsd is running, it is
  not necessary to specify the device; gpsctl does its work through gpsd, which
  will locate it for you.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When gpsd is not running, the device specification is required, and you will
  need to be running as root or be a member of the device's owning group in
  order to have write access to the device. On many Unix variants the owning
  group will be named 'dialout'.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The program accepts the following options:
<div class="Pp"></div>
-b
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Put the GPS into native (binary) mode.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-c
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Change the GPS's cycle time. Units are
  seconds. Note, most GPSes have a fixed cycle time of 1 second.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-e
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Generate the packet from any other arguments
  specified and ship it to standard output instead of the device. This switch
  can be used with the <b>-t</b> option without specifying a device. Note: the
  packet data for a binary prototype will be raw, not ASCII-ized in any
  way.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-f
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Force low-level access (not through the
  daemon).</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-l
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">List a table showing which option switches can
  be applied to which device types, and exit.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-n
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Put GPS into NMEA mode.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-s
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Set the baud rate at which the GPS emits
  packets.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Use this option with caution. On USB and Bluetooth GPSes it is also possible for
  serial mode setting to fail either because the serial adaptor chip does not
  support non-8N1 modes or because the device firmware does not properly
  synchronize the serial adaptor chip with the UART on the GPS chipset when the
  speed changes. These failures can hang your device, possibly requiring a GPS
  power cycle or (in extreme cases) physically disconnecting the NVRAM backup
  battery.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-t
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Force the device type.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-x
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Send a specified control string to the GPS;
  gpsctl will provide packet headers and trailers and checksum as appropriate
  for binary packet types, and whatever checksum and trailer is required for
  text packet types. (You must include the leading $ for NMEA packets.) When
  sending to a UBX device, the first two bytes of the string supplied will
  become the message class and type, and the remainder the payload. When sending
  to a Navcom NCT or Trimble TSIP device, the first byte is interpreted as the
  command ID and the rest as payload. When sending to a Zodiac device, the first
  two bytes are used as a message ID of type little-endian short, and the
  remainder as payload in byte pairs interpreted as little-endian short. For all
  other supported binary GPSes (notably including SiRF) the string is taken as
  the entire message payload and wrapped with appropriate header, trailer and
  checksum bytes. C-style backslash escapes in the string, notably \xNN for hex,
  will be interpreted; additionally, \e will be replaced with ESC. This switch
  implies <b>-f</b>.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-T
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Change the sampling timeout. Defaults to 8
  seconds, which should always be sufficient to get an identifying packet from a
  device emitting at the normal rate of 1 per second.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-R
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Remove the GPSD shared-memory segment used for
  SHM export. This option will normally only be of interest to GPSD
  developers.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-h
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Display program usage and exit.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-D
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Set level of debug messages.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-V
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Display program version and exit.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The argument of the forcing option, <b>-t</b>, should be a string which is
  contained in exactly one of the known driver names; for a list, do <b>gpsctl
  -l</b>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Forcing the device type behaves somewhat differently depending on whether this
  tool is going through the daemon or not. In high-level mode, if the device
  that daemon selects for you doesn't match the driver you specified, gpsctl
  exits with a warning. (This may be useful in scripts.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
In low-level mode, if the device identifies as a Generic NMEA, use the selected
  driver instead. This will be useful if you have a GPS device of known type
  that is in NMEA mode and not responding to probes. (This option was originally
  implemented for talking to SiRFStar I chips, which don't respond to the normal
  SiRF ID probe.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
If no options are given, the program will display a message identifying the GPS
  type of the selected device and exit.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Reset (-r) operations must stand alone; others can be combined. Multiple options
  will be executed in this order: mode changes (-b and -n) first, speed changes
  (-s) second, and control-string sends (-c) last.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES"><a class="selflink" href="#ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES">ENVIRONMENT
  VARIABLES</a></h1>
By setting the environment variable <b>GPSD_SHM_KEY</b>, you can control the key
  value used to designate the shared-memory segment removed with the -R option.
  This will be useful mainly when isolating test instances of gpsd from
  production ones.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="EXAMPLES"><a class="selflink" href="#EXAMPLES">EXAMPLES</a></h1>
<b>gpsctl /dev/ttyUSB0</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Attempt to identify the device on USB serial
  device 0. Time out after the default number of seconds. Adding the <b>-f</b>
  will force low-level access and suppress the normal complaint when this tool
  can't find a GPSD to work through.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
gpsctl -f -n -s 9600 /dev/ttyUSB0
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Use low-level operations (not going through a
  gpsd instance) to switch a GPS to NMEA mode at 9600bps. The tool will identify
  the GPS type itself.</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="BUGS"><a class="selflink" href="#BUGS">BUGS</a></h1>
SiRF GPSes can only be identified by the success of an attempt to flip them into
  SiRF binary mode. Thus, the process of probing one of these running in NMEA
  will change its behavior.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Baud rate and mode changes work in direct mode but are not reliable in client
  mode. This will be fixed in a future release.
