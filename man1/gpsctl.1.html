<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
gpsctl - control the modes of a GPS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
gpsctl [-h] [-b | -n] [-x control] [-e] [-f] [-l] [-s speed]
[-t devicetype] [-R] [-D debuglevel] [-V] [serial-port]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
gpsctl can switch a dual-mode GPS between NMEA and
vendor-binary modes. It can also be used to set the device
baudrate. Note: Not all devices have these capabilities.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you have only one GPS
attached to your machine, and gpsd is running, it is not
necessary to specify the device; gpsctl does its work
through gpsd, which will locate it for <br>
you.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When gpsd is not running, the
device specification is required, and you will need to be
running as root or be a member of the device&rsquo;s owning
group in order to have write access <br>
to the device. On many Unix variants the owning group will
be named &rsquo;dialout&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The program accepts the
following options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b <br>
Put the GPS into native (binary) mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c <br>
Change the GPS&rsquo;s cycle time. Units are seconds. Note,
most GPSes have a fixed cycle time of 1 second.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e <br>
Generate the packet from any other arguments specified and
ship it to standard output instead of the device. This
switch can be used with the -t option without specifying a
<br>
device. Note: the packet data for a binary prototype will be
raw, not ASCII-ized in any way.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f <br>
Force low-level access (not through the daemon).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l <br>
List a table showing which option switches can be applied to
which device types, and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n <br>
Put GPS into NMEA mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s <br>
Set the baud rate at which the GPS emits packets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use this option with caution. On
USB and Bluetooth GPSes it is also possible for serial mode
setting to fail either because the serial adaptor chip does
not support non-8N1 <br>
modes or because the device firmware does not properly
synchronize the serial adaptor chip with the UART on the GPS
chipset when the speed changes. These failures can hang <br>
your device, possibly requiring a GPS power cycle or (in
extreme cases) physically disconnecting the NVRAM backup
battery.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t <br>
Force the device type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x <br>
Send a specified control string to the GPS; gpsctl will
provide packet headers and trailers and checksum as
appropriate for binary packet types, and whatever checksum
and <br>
trailer is required for text packet types. (You must include
the leading $ for NMEA packets.) When sending to a UBX
device, the first two bytes of the string supplied will <br>
become the message class and type, and the remainder the
payload. When sending to a Navcom NCT or Trimble TSIP
device, the first byte is interpreted as the command ID and
the <br>
rest as payload. When sending to a Zodiac device, the first
two bytes are used as a message ID of type little-endian
short, and the remainder as payload in byte pairs <br>
interpreted as little-endian short. For all other supported
binary GPSes (notably including SiRF) the string is taken as
the entire message payload and wrapped with <br>
appropriate header, trailer and checksum bytes. C-style
backslash escapes in the string, notably for hex, will be
interpreted; additionally, \ will be replaced with <br>
ESC. This switch implies -f.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T <br>
Change the sampling timeout. Defaults to 8 seconds, which
should always be sufficient to get an identifying packet
from a device emitting at the normal rate of 1 per
second.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R <br>
Remove the GPSD shared-memory segment used for SHM export.
This option will normally only be of interest to GPSD
developers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h <br>
Display program usage and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D <br>
Set level of debug messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V <br>
Display program version and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The argument of the forcing
option, -t, should be a string which is contained in exactly
one of the known driver names; for a list, do gpsctl -l.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Forcing the device type behaves
somewhat differently depending on whether this tool is going
through the daemon or not. In high-level mode, if the device
that daemon selects for <br>
you doesn&rsquo;t match the driver you specified, gpsctl
exits with a warning. (This may be useful in scripts.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In low-level mode, if the device
identifies as a Generic NMEA, use the selected driver
instead. This will be useful if you have a GPS device of
known type that is in NMEA mode <br>
and not responding to probes. (This option was originally
implemented for talking to SiRFStar I chips, which
don&rsquo;t respond to the normal SiRF ID probe.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no options are given, the
program will display a message identifying the GPS type of
the selected device and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Reset (-r) operations must stand
alone; others can be combined. Multiple options will be
executed in this order: mode changes (-b and -n) first,
speed changes (-s) second, and <br>
control-string sends (-c) last.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
By setting the environment variable GPSD_SHM_KEY, you can
control the key value used to designate the shared-memory
segment removed with the -R option. This will be useful
mainly <br>
when isolating test instances of gpsd from production
ones.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
gpsctl /dev/ttyUSB0 <br>
Attempt to identify the device on USB serial device 0. Time
out after the default number of seconds. Adding the -f will
force low-level access and suppress the normal <br>
complaint when this tool can&rsquo;t find a GPSD to work
through.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gpsctl -f -n -s 9600
/dev/ttyUSB0 <br>
Use low-level operations (not going through a gpsd instance)
to switch a GPS to NMEA mode at 9600bps. The tool will
identify the GPS type itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
SiRF GPSes can only be identified by the success of an
attempt to flip them into SiRF binary mode. Thus, the
process of probing one of these running in NMEA will change
its <br>
behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Baud rate and mode changes work
in direct mode but are not reliable in client mode. This
will be fixed in a future release.</p>
