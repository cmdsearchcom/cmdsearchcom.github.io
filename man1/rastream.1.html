<b>rastream</b> - stream block processor for <b>argus(8)</b> data.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<b>rastream</b> [[ <b>-M</b> <i>splitmode</i>] [<i>splitmode options</i>]] [
  <b>-f</b> <i>file processing program</i> -B secs] [ <b>raoptions</b>]
  [<b>--</b> <i>filter-expression</i>]
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>Rastream</b> reads <b>argus</b> data from an <i>argus-data</i> source, and
  splits the resulting output into consecutive sections of records based on
  size, count time, or flow event, writing the output into a set of
  output-files.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>Rastream</b> provides the option to run a program against the output files,
  <b>seconds</b> after the file is understood to be finished. The program must
  be specified in a manner so that <b>rastream</b> can find it, either within
  the system $PATH, or provided as a full pathname.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
By default, <b>rastream</b> splits the stream by output file record count,
  putting 10,000 records of input into each <b>argus</b> output file, or
  standard out, as needed. The behavior is similar to the unix split.1 command.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The output files' name consists of a prefix, which is specified using the
  <i>-w</i> <i>ra option</i>, and a suffix, which is created for each resulting
  file. If no prefix is provided, then <b>rastream</b> will use 'x' as the
  default prefix. The suffix that is used is determined by the mode of
  operation. When <b>rastream</b> is using the default count mode or the size
  mode, the suffix is a group of letters 'aa', &#x00B4;ab&#x00B4;, and so on,
  such that concatenating the output files in sorted order by file name produces
  the original input file. If <b>rastream</b> will need to create more output
  files than are allowed by the default suffix strategy, more letters will be
  added, in order to accomodate the needed files. When the mode is <b>time</b>
  mode, the default output filename suffix is '%Y.%m.%d.%h.%m.%s', which is used
  by strftime() to create an output filename that is time oriented. This default
  is overrided by adding a '%' extension to the name provided on the commandline
  using the <i>-w</i> option.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
When standard out is specified, using <i>-w -</i>, <b>rastream</b> will output a
  single <b>argus-stream</b> with START and STOP argus management records
  inserted appropriately to indicate where the output is split. See
  <b>argus(8)</b> for more information on output stream formats.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
When <b>rastream</b> is spliting on output record count (the default), the
  number of records is specified as an ordinal counter, the default is 10,000
  records. When <b>rastream</b> is spliting based on the maximum output file
  size, the size is specified as bytes. The scale of the bytes can be specified
  by appending 'b', 'k' and 'm' to the number provided.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
When <b>rastream</b> is spliting based on time, the time period is specified
  with the option, and can be any period based in seconds (s), minutes (m),
  hours (h), days (d), weeks (w), months (M) or years (y). <b>Rastream</b> will
  create and modify records as required to split on prescribed time boundaries.
  If any record spans a time boundary, the record is split and the metrics are
  adjusted using a uniform distribution model to distribute the statistics
  between the two records. Care is taken to avoid records with zero packet and
  byte counts, that could result from roundoff error.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
When <b>rastream</b> is spliting based on flow event, the flow that acts as the
  event marker is specified using a standard <b>ra</b> filter expression, that
  is bounded by quotes (&quot;). Records that preceed the first flow event in
  the data stream are written to the specified output file, and then new files
  are generated with the flow event record being the first record of the new
  file. This method will allow you to use wire events as triggers for spliting
  data.

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="RASTREAM_SPECIFIC_OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#RASTREAM_SPECIFIC_OPTIONS">RASTREAM
  SPECIFIC OPTIONS</a></h1>
Rastream, like all ra based clients, supports a number of <b>ra options</b>
  including remote data access, reading from multiple files and filtering of
  input argus records through a terminating filter expression.
  <b>rastream(1)</b> specific options are:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-a</b><i> suffix length</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Starting append suffix length. The default is 2
    characters.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-B</b><i> duration</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Buffer hold time before processing. This value is usually
      in the 5-15 second range and provides time for rastream to sort records
      and schedule outputfile processing. The number is derived from the larges
      FAR status interval of all the argus data sources encountered.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
  </dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-f</b><i> program</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Post processing program. <b>rastream</b>, will execute this
      program just after closing the output file, passing the full path to the
      closed output file as a parameter, using this convention:
    <pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
   program -r /full/path/to/closed/file
<div class="Pp"></div>
    </pre>
    This allows you to post-process the output file in an automated fashion.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Generally, this program can do anything you like, such as aggregating and
      correcting flow records, labeling records for semantic enhancement,
      indexing the files, using programs like rasqltimeindex(), and compressing
      the files. Traditionally, the program has been a shell-script, perl
      program, or php script, so that it can be easily modified, on the fly, but
      it can be any executable that can handle the &quot;-r filename&quot;
      parameter convention. The program should provides its own accountability
      and error logging, so that you know that things are working as you expect.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
     <b>rastream</b> must have a path to the program, the program must be
      executable, and <b>rastream</b> must have permission to run the program
      for this strategy to be successful.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    An example rastream.sh is provided in the ./support/Config directory.

      fields.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Another extended feature, when using <b>time</b> mode, <b>rastream</b> will
      process the supplied filename using <b>strftime(3)</b>, so that time

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="INVOCATION"><a class="selflink" href="#INVOCATION">INVOCATION</a></h1>
This invocation reads <b>argus(8)</b> data from <b>inputfile</b> and splits the
  <b>argus(8)</b> data stream based on output file size of no greater than 1
  Megabyte. The resulting output files have a prefix of <i>argus.</i> and suffix
  that starts with 'aa'. The single trailing '.' is significant.
<pre>
 
    <b>rastream</b> -r inputfile -M size 1m -w argus.
 
</pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This invocation splits <b>inputfile</b> based on hard 10 minute time boundaries.
  The resulting output files are created with a prefix of
  <i>/archive/%Y/%m/%d/argus.</i> and the suffix is <i>%H.%M.%S</i>. The values
  will be supplied based on the time in the record being written out.
<pre>
  
    <b>rastream</b> -r * -M time 10m -w &quot;/archive/%Y/%m/%d/argus.%H.%M.%S&quot;
 
</pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This invocation splits <b>inputfile</b> based on the argus source identifier.
  The resulting output files are created with a prefix of <i>/archive/Source
  Identifier/argus.</i> and the default suffix starting with &quot;aa&quot;. The
  source identifier will be supplied based on the contents of the record being
  exported.
<pre>
  
    <b>rastream</b> -r * -M time 10m -w &quot;/archive/$srcid/argus.&quot;
 
</pre>
This invocation splits <b>inputfile</b> based on a flow event marker. The
  resulting output files are created with a prefix of 'outfile.' and the default
  suffix starting with &quot;aa&quot;. Whenever a ping to a specific host is
  seen in the stream, a new output file is generated.
<pre>
  
    <b>rastream</b> -r * -M flow &quot;echo and host 1.2.3.4&quot; -w outfile.
