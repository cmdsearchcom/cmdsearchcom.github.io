texexpand - expand \input and \include statements in a TeX file
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
General translation mechanism:
<div class="Pp"></div>
The main program latex2html calls texexpand with the document name in order to
  expand some of its \input and \include statements, here also called 'merging',
  and to write a list of sensitized style, class, input, or include file names.
  When texexpand has finished, all is contained in one file, TMP_foo. (assumed
  foo.tex is the name of the document to translate).
<div class="Pp"></div>
In this version, texexpand cares for following environments that may span
  include files / section boundaries: a) \begin{comment} b) %begin{comment} c)
  \begin{any} introduced with \excludecomment d) %begin{any} e) \begin{verbatim}
  f) \begin{latexonly} g) %begin{latexonly}
<div class="Pp"></div>
e) - g) prevent texexpand from expanding input files, but the environment
  content goes fully into the output file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Together with each merging of \input etc. there are so-called %%%texexpand
  markers accompanying the boundary.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When latex2html reads in the output file, it uses these markers to write each
  part to a separate file, and process them further.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Detailed technical notes:</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
1. %begin{latexonly} and %end{latexonly} have to be on a separate line. Anything
  between these tags (including the tags) is discarded.
<div class="Pp"></div>
2. \begin{latexonly} and \end{latexonly} have to be on a separate line. Anything
  between these tags (including the tags) is not expanded.
<div class="Pp"></div>
3. [%\]begin{&quot;to exclude&quot;} and [%\]end{&quot;to exclude&quot;} have to
  be on a separate line. Anything between these tags (including the tags) is
  discarded.
<div class="Pp"></div>
4. \begin{verbatim/verbatim*} and \end{verbatim/verbatim*} have to be on a
  separate line. Anything between these tags (including the tags) is not
  expanded.
<div class="Pp"></div>
5. The scope of any such tags may extend over several files. The opening tag for
  latexonly may occur on a different include level than the closing tag. The
  opening tag for verbatim/&quot;to exclude&quot; must occur within the same
  file than the closing tag.
<div class="Pp"></div>
6. Warnings are printed when the document has been parsed and open tags remain.
<div class="Pp"></div>
7. When in a &quot;to exclude&quot;/verbatim environment, texexpand won't
  recognize ANY command except the corresponding closing tag. There cannot be
  any nested constructions. This behaviour is identical to that of LaTeX.
<div class="Pp"></div>
8. \begin{latexonly},\end{latexonly} may be nested, whereas
  %begin{latexonly},%end{latexonly} may not be nested.
<div class="Pp"></div>
9. A &quot;%&quot; tag cannot close a &quot;\&quot; tag, and vice versa.
<div class="Pp"></div>
10. Every \ <i>document</i>(class&#x23AA;style), \usepackage, \input and
  \include command has to be on a separate line.
<div class="Pp"></div>
11. Everything behind a `%' that isn't preceded by a `\' is regarded as a
  comment, i.e. it is printed but not interpreted.
<div class="Pp"></div>
12. If any command listed in 10. is preceded by an occurence of `\verb' or
  `\latex' then it is NOT interpreted. This crashes on lines like this: blah
  blah \verb+foo foo+ \input{bar} % bar won't be loaded!
<div class="Pp"></div>
13. Packages provided via \usepackage are handled the same way as `options' in \
  <i>document</i>(class&#x23AA;style), i.e. they are included when -auto_exclude
  is off, the package isn't in @dont_include *OR* the package is in @do_include
  (new). They are added to the style file together with their options if the
  file itself hasn't been merged. \documentclass[options]{class} searches for
  every option.clo, \documentstyle[options]{style} searches for every
  option.sty. \usepackage[options]{packages} searches for every package.sty.
<div class="Pp"></div>
14. Each texinputs directory is searched for input files/styles. If it ends in
  `//', the whole subdirectory tree is searched.
<div class="Pp"></div>
15. \input / \include merge the given file (if found under the given name or
  with .tex extension) if its basename is in @do_include or if it isn't in
  @dont_include or if the given filename doesn't end in .sty/.clo/.cls when
  -auto_exclude is set.

Include and parse a file. This routine is recursive, see also
  &amp;process_input_include_file, &amp;process_document_header, and
  &amp;process_package_cmd.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Two global flags control the states of texexpand.
<br/>
 o $active is true if we should interprete the lines to expand files, check for
  packages, etc.
<br/>
 o $mute is true if we should prevent the lines from going into the out file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
We have three general states of texexpand:
<br/>
 1) interprete the lines and pass them to the out file This is the normal case.
  Corresponding: $active true, $mute false
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 2) interprete minimal and suppress them
This is when parsing inside a comment environment, which
also would retain its body from LaTeX. =&gt; $active false, $mute true
<div class="Pp"></div>
</pre>
<pre>
 3) interprete minimal and pass the lines to the out file
This is inside a verbatim or latexonly environment.
The line of course must be at least interpreted to determine the closing tag.
=&gt; $active false, $mute false
<div class="Pp"></div>
</pre>
Any environment may extend over several include files. Any environement except
  verbatim and latexonly may have its opening or closing tag on different input
  levels. The comment and verbatim environments cannot be nested, as is with
  LaTeX. We must at least parse verbatim/comment environments in latexonly
  environments, to catch fake latexonly tags.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The work scheme: Five functions influence texexpand's behavior. o
  &amp;process_file opens the given file and parses the non-comment part in
  order to set $active and $mute (see above). It calls &amp;interprete to
  interprete the non-comment content and either continues with the next line of
  its file or terminates if &amp;interprete detected the \end{document} or an
  \endinput.
<div class="Pp"></div>
o &amp;interprete handles some LaTeX tags with respect to the three states
  controlled by $active and $mute. Regarding to \input&#x23AA;include, \
  <i>document</i>(class&#x23AA;style), and \(use&#x23AA;Require)package the
  functions &amp;process_input_include_file, &amp;process_document_header, and
  &amp;process_package_cmd are called respectively.
<div class="Pp"></div>
o These three functions check if the file name or option files are enabled or
  disabled for merging (via TEXE_DO_INCLUDE or TEXE_DONT_INCLUDE). Any file that
  is to include will be 'merged' into the current file, i.e. the function
  &amp;process_file is called at this place in time (recursively). This will
  stop interpretation at the current line in file, start with the new file to
  process and continues with the next line as soon as the new file is
  interpreted to its end.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The call tree (noweb+xy.sty would be handy here):
<div class="Pp"></div>

      v
 +-&gt;process_file
 &#x23AA;    &#x23AA;
 &#x23AA;    v

 &#x23AA;    v                           v                        v
 &#x23AA;  process_input_include_file  process_document_header  process_package_cmd
 &#x23AA;    &#x23AA;                           &#x23AA;                        &#x23AA;
 &#x23AA;    v                           v                        v
 +----+---------------------------+------------------------+

</pre>
Bugs: o Since the latexonly environment is not parsed, its contents might
  introduce environments which are not recognized.
<div class="Pp"></div>
o The closing tag for latexonly is not found if hidden inside an input file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
o One environment tag per line, yet!
<div class="Pp"></div>
o If I would have to design test cases for this beast I would immediately
  desintegrate into a logic cloud.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Notes:
<div class="Pp"></div>
o Ok, I designed test cases for it. Please refer to test 'expand' of the
  regression test suite in the developers' module of the l2h repository.
<div class="Pp"></div>
o -unsegment feature: In this (rare) case, the user wants to translate a
  segmented document not in segments but in a whole (for testing, say). We
  enable this by recognizing the \segment command in &amp;interprete, causing
  the segment file to be treated like \input but loosing the first lines prior
  to \startdocument (incl.), as controlled via $segmentfile. On how to segment a
  document you are best guided by section ``Document Segmentation'' of the
  LaTeX2HTML manual.
