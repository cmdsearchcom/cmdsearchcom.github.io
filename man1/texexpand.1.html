<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
texexpand - expand input and include statements in a TeX
file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
General translation mechanism:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The main program latex2html
calls texexpand with the document name in order to expand
some of its input and include statements, here also called
&rsquo;merging&rsquo;, and to write a list <br>
of sensitized style, class, input, or include file names.
When texexpand has finished, all is contained in one file,
TMP_foo. (assumed foo.tex is the name of the document to
<br>
translate).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In this version, texexpand cares
for following environments that may span include files /
section boundaries: a) g i n { g a i n n y { } cnt} b)
%begin{comment} c) id o n m t m r o d u c g g i i n <br>
with \xcludecomment d) %begin{any} e) nrbatim} f) {xonly} {
l v a t g) %begin{latexonly}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">e) - g) prevent texexpand from
expanding input files, but the environment content goes
fully into the output file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Together with each merging of
input etc. there are so-called %%%texexpand markers
accompanying the boundary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When latex2html reads in the
output file, it uses these markers to write each part to a
separate file, and process them further.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Detailed technical notes:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. %begin{latexonly} and
%end{latexonly} have to be on a separate line. Anything
between these tags (including the tags) is discarded. g i
n</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. {xonly} and \nd{latexonly}
have to be on a separate l a t line. Anything between these
tags (including the tags) is not expanded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. [%]begin{&quot;to
exclude&quot;} and [%]end{&quot;to exclude&quot;} have to be
on a separate line. Anything between these tags (including
the tags) is discarded.g i</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. nrbatim/verbatim*} and
\nd{verbatim/verbatim*} have to { v be on a separate line.
Anything between these tags (including the tags) is not
expanded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5. The scope of any such tags
may extend over several files. The opening tag for latexonly
may occur on a different include level than the closing tag.
The opening tag for <br>
verbatim/&quot;to exclude&quot; must occur within the same
file than the closing tag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6. Warnings are printed when the
document has been parsed and open tags remain.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">7. When in a &quot;to
exclude&quot;/verbatim environment, texexpand won&rsquo;t
recognize ANY command except the corresponding closing tag.
There cannot be any nested constructions. This <br>
behaviour is identical to that of LaTeX. g i n</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">8. {xonly},\nd{latexonly} may be
nested, whereas l a t %begin{latexonly},%end{latexonly} may
not be nested.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">9. A &quot;%&quot; tag cannot
close a &quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">10. Every
ocument(class&acirc;&ordf;style), sepackage, input and
include command has to be on a separate line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">11. Everything behind a
&lsquo;%&rsquo; that isn&rsquo;t preceded by a
&lsquo;&acute; is regarded as a comment, i.e. it is printed
but not interpreted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">12. If any command listed in 10.
is preceded by an occurence of &lsquo;b&rsquo; or
&lsquo;ex&rsquo; then it is NOT interpreted. This crashes on
lines like this: blah blah b+foo foo+ <br>
input{bar} % bar won&rsquo;t be loaded!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">13. Packages provided via
sepackage are handled the same way as &lsquo;options&rsquo;
in ocument(class&acirc;&ordf;style), i.e. they are included
when -auto_exclude is off, the package isn&rsquo;t in <br>
@dont_include *OR* the package is in @do_include (new). They
are added to the style file together with their options if
the file itself hasn&rsquo;t been merged. <br>
ocumentclass[options]{class} searches for every option.clo,
ocumentstyle[options]{style} searches for every option.sty.
sepackage[options]{packages} searches for every <br>
package.sty.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">14. Each texinputs directory is
searched for input files/styles. If it ends in
&lsquo;//&rsquo;, the whole subdirectory tree is
searched.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">15. input / include merge the
given file (if found under the given name or with .tex
extension) if its basename is in @do_include or if it
isn&rsquo;t in @dont_include or if the <br>
given filename doesn&rsquo;t end in .sty/.clo/.cls when
-auto_exclude is set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Notes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Recognizes ocumentclass,
ocumentstyle, sepackage, rbatim}...\nd{verbatim},
%begin{latexonly}...%end{latexonly}, g i n { <br>
xonly}...\nd{latexonly}, input, include, b, ex \ndinput, l a
t g i n \nd{document} includecomment, \xcludecomment
{xclude&quot;}, \nd{&quot;to &quot; t o exclude&quot;} <br>
%begin{&quot;to exclude&quot;}, %end{&quot;to
exclude&quot;}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The gory Details <br>
Include and parse a file. This routine is recursive, see
also &amp;process_input_include_file,
&amp;process_document_header, and
&amp;process_package_cmd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Two global flags control the
states of texexpand. <br>
o $active is true if we should interprete the lines to
expand files, check for packages, etc. <br>
o $mute is true if we should prevent the lines from going
into the out file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">We have three general states of
texexpand: <br>
1) interprete the lines and pass them to the out file This
is the normal case. Corresponding: $active true, $mute
false</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2) interprete minimal and
suppress them <br>
This is when parsing inside a comment environment, which
<br>
also would retain its body from LaTeX. =&gt; $active false,
$mute true</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3) interprete minimal and pass
the lines to the out file <br>
This is inside a verbatim or latexonly environment. <br>
The line of course must be at least interpreted to determine
the closing tag. <br>
=&gt; $active false, $mute false</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any environment may extend over
several include files. Any environement except verbatim and
latexonly may have its opening or closing tag on different
input levels. The comment <br>
and verbatim environments cannot be nested, as is with
LaTeX. We must at least parse verbatim/comment environments
in latexonly environments, to catch fake latexonly tags.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The work scheme: Five functions
influence texexpand&rsquo;s behavior. o &amp;process_file
opens the given file and parses the non-comment part in
order to set $active and $mute (see <br>
above). It calls &amp;interprete to interprete the
non-comment content and either continues with the next line
of its file or terminates if &amp;interprete detected the
\nd{document} <br>
or an \ndinput.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o &amp;interprete handles some
LaTeX tags with respect to the three states controlled by
$active and $mute. Regarding to input&acirc;&ordf;include,
ocument(class&acirc;&ordf;style), and <br>
e&acirc;&ordf;Require)package the functions
&amp;process_input_include_file,
&amp;process_document_header, and &amp;process_package_cmd
are called respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o These three functions check if
the file name or option files are enabled or disabled for
merging (via TEXE_DO_INCLUDE or TEXE_DONT_INCLUDE). Any file
that is to include will <br>
be &rsquo;merged&rsquo; into the current file, i.e. the
function &amp;process_file is called at this place in time
(recursively). This will stop interpretation at the current
line in file, <br>
start with the new file to process and continues with the
next line as soon as the new file is interpreted to its
end.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The call tree (noweb+xy.sty
would be handy here):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">main <br>
&acirc;&ordf; <br>
v <br>
+-&gt;process_file <br>
&acirc;&ordf; &acirc;&ordf; <br>
&acirc;&ordf; v <br>
&acirc;&ordf; interprete (with respect to the current line,
one of that three) <br>
&acirc;&ordf; &acirc;&ordf; &acirc;&ordf; &acirc;&ordf; <br>
&acirc;&ordf; v v v <br>
&acirc;&ordf; process_input_include_file
process_document_header process_package_cmd <br>
&acirc;&ordf; &acirc;&ordf; &acirc;&ordf; &acirc;&ordf; <br>
&acirc;&ordf; v v v <br>

+----+---------------------------+------------------------+</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bugs: o Since the latexonly
environment is not parsed, its contents might introduce
environments which are not recognized.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o The closing tag for latexonly
is not found if hidden inside an input file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o One environment tag per line,
yet!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o If I would have to design test
cases for this beast I would immediately desintegrate into a
logic cloud.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Notes:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Ok, I designed test cases for
it. Please refer to test &rsquo;expand&rsquo; of the
regression test suite in the developers&rsquo; module of the
l2h repository.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o -unsegment feature: In this
(rare) case, the user wants to translate a segmented
document not in segments but in a whole (for testing, say).
We enable this by recognizing the <br>
ment command in &amp;interprete, causing the segment file to
be treated like input but loosing the first lines prior to
rtdocument (incl.), as controlled via $segmentfile. <br>
On how to segment a document you are best guided by section
&lsquo;&lsquo;Document Segmentation&rsquo;&rsquo; of the
LaTeX2HTML manual.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CAVEATS <br>
This utility is automatically configured and built to work
on the local setup. If this setup changes (e.g. some of the
external commands are moved), the script has be be <br>
reconfigured.</p>
