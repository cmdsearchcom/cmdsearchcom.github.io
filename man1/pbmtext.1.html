<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pbmtext - render text into a PBM image</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pbmtext [-font fontfile] [-builtin fontname] [-space pixels]
[-lspace pixels] [-nomargins] [-width pixels] [text]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Minimum unique abbreviation of
option is acceptable. You may use double hyphens instead of
single hyphen to denote options. You may use white space in
place of the equals sign <br>
to separate an option name from its value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This program is part of Netpbm(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pbmtext takes the specified
text, either a single line from the command line or multiple
lines from standard input, and renders it into a PBM
graphical image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the image, each line of input
is a line of output. Formatting characters such as newline
have no effect on the formatting; like any unprintable
character, they turn into spa&acirc; <br>
ces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The image is just wide enough
for the longest line of text, plus margins, and just high
enough to contain the lines of text, plus margins.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The left and right margins are
twice the width of the widest character in the font; the top
and bottom margins are the height of the tallest character
in the font. But if the <br>
text is only one line, all the margins are half of this. You
can use the -nomargins option to eliminate the margins.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pbmtextps does the same thing as
pbmtext, but uses Ghostscript to generate the characters,
which means you can use Postscript fonts. But it also means
you have to have Ghost&acirc; <br>
script installed and it isn&rsquo;t as fast. Also, pbmtextps
generates only one line of text, whereas pbmtext can create
multiple lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pbmtext is meant for small
quantities of simple text. If you&rsquo;re working with a
document, you would be better off using a document
formatting program to &rsquo;print&rsquo; to a Postscript
<br>
file, then feeding that Postscript to pstopnm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-font</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-builtin <br>
-builtin selects a font among those built into Netpbm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-font selects a font that you
supply yourself either as an X Window System BDF (Bitmap
Distribution Format)
&acirc;&uml;http://xfree86.org/current/bdf.pdf&acirc;&copy;
file or as a PBM file in <br>
a special form.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is the built in font
&rsquo;bdf.&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&rsquo;bdf&rsquo; is Times-Roman
15 pixels high. (That&rsquo;s about 14 point type printed at
75 dpi).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&rsquo;fixed&rsquo; is a built
in fixed width font.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For information about other
fonts, and how to make one of your own, see Fonts
&acirc;&uml;#fonts&acirc;&copy; below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-space pixels <br>
Add pixels pixels of space between characters. This is in
addition to whatever space surrounding characters is built
into the font, which is usually enough to produce a <br>
reasonable string of text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pixels may be fractional, in
which case the number of pixels added varies so as to
achieve the specified average. For example -space=1.5 causes
half the spaces to be 1 <br>
pixel and half to be 2 pixels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pixels may be negative to crowd
text together, but the author has not put much thought or
testing into how this works in every possible case, so it
might cause disastrous <br>
results.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-lspace pixels <br>
Add pixels pixels of space between lines. This is in
addition to whatever space above and below characters is
built into the font, which is usually enough to produce a
<br>
reasonable line spacing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pixels must be a whole
number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pixels may be negative to crowd
lines together, but the author has not put much thought or
testing into how this works in every possible case, so it
might cause disastrous <br>
results.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nomargins <br>
By default, pbmtext adds margins all around the image as
described above. This option causes pbmtext not to add any
margins.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that there may still be
space beyond the edges of the type because a character
itself may include space at its edges. To eliminate all
surrounding background, so the <br>
type touches all four edges of the image, use pnmcrop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-width pixels <br>
This specifies how much horizontal space the text is
supposed to fit into.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the input is one line,
pbmtext breaks it into multiple lines as needed to fit the
specified width. It breaks it between characters, but does
not pay attention to white <br>
space; it may break in the middle of a word and a line may
begin or end with white space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the input is multiple lines,
pbmtext assumes you already have line breaks where they make
sense, and pbmtext simply truncates each line as needed to
fit the specified <br>
width.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USAGE <br>
Often, you want to place text over another image. One way to
do this is with ppmlabel. For more flexible (but complex)
drawing of text on an image, there is ppmdraw. These do <br>
not give you the font options that pbmtext does, though.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another way is to use pbmtext to
create an image containing the text, then use pamcomp to
overlay the text image onto your base image. To make only
the text (and not the entire <br>
rectangle containing it) cover the base image, you will need
to give pamcomp a mask, via its -alpha option. You can just
use the text image itself as the mask, as long as you <br>
also specify the -invert option to pamcomp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to overlay colored
text instead of black, just use ppmchange to change all
black pixels to the color of your choice before overlaying
the text image. But still use <br>
the original black and white image for the alpha mask.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want the text at an
angle, use pnmrotate on the text image (and alpha mask)
before overlaying.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FONTS <br>
There are three kinds of fonts you an use with pbmtext:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; built in</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; BDF</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; PBM</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Built In Fonts <br>
There are two built in fonts: bdf and fixed. You select
these fonts with a -builtin option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bdf is the default when you
specify no font information on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bdf is encoded in ISO 8859-1
(Latin 1, 8-bit). In addition to English it can handle most
West European languages (Spanish, French, German, Swedish
...) This set lacks the Euro <br>
currency sign.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fixed is ASCII (7-bit) only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BDF Font <br>
BDF is an ancient font format that at one time was standard
for the X Window System. Now, you don&rsquo;t see it very
often, but you can find some BDF fonts on the Xfree86 <br>

&acirc;&uml;http://cvsweb.xfree86.org/cvsweb/xc/fonts/bdf/&acirc;&copy;
web site.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can get the full package of
the BDF fonts from XFree86 (see above) from the Netpbm web
site
&acirc;&uml;http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/bdffont.tgz&acirc;&copy;
.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PBM Font <br>
To create a font as a PBM file (to use with the -font
option), you just create a PBM image of the text matrix
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first step is to display
text matrix below on the screen, e.g. in an X11 window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">M &rsquo;,/^_[&lsquo;jpqy| M</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/ !&rsquo;#$%&amp;&rsquo;()*+ /
<br>
&lt; ,-./01234567 &lt; <br>
&gt; 89:;&lt;=&gt;?@ABC &gt; <br>
@ DEFGHIJKLMNO @ <br>
_ PQRSTUVWXYZ[ _ <br>
{ ]^_&lsquo;abcdefg { <br>
} hijklmnopqrs } <br>
~ tuvwxyz{|}~ ~</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">M &rsquo;,/^_[&lsquo;jpqy| M</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Make sure it&rsquo;s a fixed
width font -- This should display as a perfect
rectangle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also, try to use a simple
display program. Pbmtext divides this into a matrix of
cells, all the same size, each containing one character, so
it is important that whatever you <br>
use to display it display with uniform horizontal and
vertical spacing. Fancy word processing programs sometimes
stretch characters in both directions to fit certain
dimensions, <br>
and that won&rsquo;t work. Sometimes a display program
scales a font to show a character larger or smaller than its
natural size. That too won&rsquo;t often work because the
rounding <br>
involved in such scaling causes non-uniform distances
between characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you display the text matrix
improperly, the usual symptom is that when you try to use
the font, pbmtext fails with an error message telling you
that the number of lines in the <br>
font isn&rsquo;t divisible by 11, or it can&rsquo;t find the
blank band around the inner rectangle. Sometimes the symptom
is that one of the characters displays with a piece of the
charac&acirc; <br>
ter that is next to it in the matrix. For example,
&rsquo;l&rsquo; might display with a little piece of the
&rsquo;m&rsquo; attached on its right.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Do a screen grab or window dump
of that text, using for instance xwd, xgrabsc, or
screendump. Convert the result into a pbm file. If
necessary, use pamcut to remove anything <br>
you grabbed in addition to the text pictured above (or be a
wimp and use a graphical editor such as ImageMagick).
Finally, run it through pnmcrop. to make sure the edges are
<br>
right up against the text. pbmtext can figure out the sizes
and spacings from that.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NON-ENGLISH TEXT <br>
pbmtext does little to accommodate the special needs of
non-English text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pbmtext reads input in byte
units. Unicode (utf-7, utf-8, utf-16, etc.) text which
contains multibyte characters does not work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pbmtext can handle 7-bit and
8-bit character sets. Examples are ASCII, ISO 8859 family,
koi8-r/u and VISCII. It is up to the user to supply a BDF
file covering the necessary <br>
glyphs with the &quot;-font&quot; option. The font file must
be in the right encoding.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pbmtext does not recognize
locale. It ignores the associated environment variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pbmtext cannot render vertically
or right to left.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TIPS <br>
If you get garbled output, check whether the font file
encoding corresponds to the input text encoding. Also make
sure that your input is not in utf-* or any other multi-byte
<br>
format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To dump characters in a BDF font
file run this command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ awk &rsquo;BEGIN { for
(i=0x01; i&lt;=0xFF; i++) <br>
{ printf(&rsquo;%c%s&rsquo;,i,i%16==15 ?
&rsquo;0:&rsquo;&rsquo;); } }&rsquo; | pbmtext -f font.bdf
&gt; dump.pbm</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you need only ASCII, change
the for statement to:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">for (i=0x20; i&lt;=0x7E;
i++)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To check the encoding of a BDF
file, examine the CHARSET_REGISTRY line and the next line,
which should be CHARSET_ENCODING:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ grep -A1 CHARSET_REGISTRY
font-a.bdf <br>
CHARSET_REGISTRY &rsquo;ISO8859&rsquo; <br>
CHARSET_ENCODING &rsquo;1&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ grep -A1 CHARSET_REGISTRY
font-b.bdf <br>
CHARSET_REGISTRY &rsquo;ISO10646&rsquo; <br>
CHARSET_ENCODING &rsquo;1&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The latter is Unicode. BDF files
coded in ISO 16046-1 usually work for Western European
languages, because ISO 16046-1 expands ISO 8859-1 (also
called &rsquo;Latin-1&rsquo;) while maintain&acirc; <br>
ing the first 256 code points. ISO 8859-1 itself is a
superset of ASCII. Run the above command and verify the
necessary glyphs are present.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It may sound strange that
pbmtext accepts font files encoded in Unicode but not input
text in Unicode. This is because Unicode provides several
&rsquo;numbering schemes&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When rendering text in character
sets other than ISO 8859-1, one often has to produce a BDF
file in the given encoding from a master BDF file encoded in
ISO 10646-1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In particular, 75% of the BDF
files in the font collection available from the Netpbm
website
&acirc;&uml;http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/bdffont.tgz&acirc;&copy;
are in ISO 10646-1. Many have the Euro <br>
sign, Greek letters, etc, but they are placed in code points
beyond what pbmtext sees.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are several programs that
perform BDF encoding conversion. If you have the X Window
System installed, first look for ucs2any. If you
don&rsquo;t, you can download ucs2any.pl <br>
from Unicodefontsandtools for X11 (1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another converter is trbdf,
included in the &rsquo;trscripts&rsquo; package, available
in some GNU/Linux distributions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BDF files encoded in ISO 8859-2,
ISO 8859-7, koi8-r, etc. are available from ISO8859Alphabet
Soup (1) <br>
and its sister page TheCyrillicCharset Soup (1) of 8-bit
character sets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To convert OTF or TTF font files
to BDF, use <br>
