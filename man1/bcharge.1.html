<p>BCHARGE(1) General Commands Manual BCHARGE(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
bcharge - program to set BlackBerry handhelds to 500mA</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
bcharge</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
bcharge is a program that sends a special handshake to all
BlackBerry devices it finds on the USB bus. This handshake
causes the device to reset itself, and then request 500mA
<br>
instead of the usual 100mA. This allows proper charging on
Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is safe to run this command
multiple times, as it only changes devices that are not
already set to 500mA, or are not in the desired mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-o For Blackberry Pearl devices, using this switch causes
bcharge to set the Product ID to 0001.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the Pearl is in 0004 mode,
two USB interfaces are presented: one for database access
and one for mass storage. In 0001 mode, only the database
access is available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Before bcharge is run, the Pearl
shows up with a Product ID of 0006, which only gives mass
storage functionality. You must run bcharge for the Pearl
before using btool.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d This switch is for the
Blackberry Pearl to switch it back to 0004 dual mode after
having run bcharge with the -o option. Alternately, newer
devices (such as Storm with <br>
product ID of 8007) will be switched to 0004. Since a Pearl
in mode 0001 is practically indistinguishable from a classic
Blackberry, the -d switch is needed to tell <br>
bcharge that you really are working with a Pearl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g Guess whether Dual mode is
needed. If USB Interface Class 255 is not found on the
device (the class used for database access), then dual mode
is set. Otherwise, the <br>
device is left as is.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Help summary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p devpath <br>
If your system runs a kernel with CONFIG_USB_SUSPEND enabled
(some Ubuntu kernels have this turned on, as well as some
Fedora 7 kernels), then you also need to adjust the <br>
suspend state to avoid going into power saving mode. This
option is used when run from udev, using a rule such as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUS==&quot;usb&quot;,
SUBSYSTEM==&quot;usb_device&quot;, ACTION==&quot;add&quot;,
SYSFS{idVendor}==&quot;0fca&quot;,
SYSFS{idProduct}==&quot;0001&quot;,
SYMLINK+=&quot;bb-%k&quot;, GROUP=&quot;plugdev&quot;,
MODE=&quot;0660&quot;, <br>
RUN=&quot;/usr/sbin/bcharge -p %p&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When using this option, you will
almost always need to be root.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s path <br>
Specify the mount point for the sysfs filesystem. On most
systems this is mounted at /sys which is the default.</p>
