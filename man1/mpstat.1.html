<p>MPSTAT(1) Linux User&rsquo;s Manual MPSTAT(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
mpstat - Report processors related statistics.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
mpstat [ -A ] [ -u ] [ -V ] [ -I { SUM | CPU | SCPU | ALL }
] [ -P { cpu [,...] | ON | ALL } ] [ interval [ count ]
]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The mpstat command writes to standard output activities for
each available processor, processor 0 being the first one.
Global average activities among all processors are also <br>
reported. The mpstat command can be used both on SMP and UP
machines, but in the latter, only global average activities
will be printed. If no activity has been selected, then <br>
the default report is the CPU utilization report.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The interval parameter specifies
the amount of time in seconds between each report. A value
of 0 (or no parameters at all) indicates that processors
statistics are to be <br>
reported for the time since system startup (boot). The count
parameter can be specified in conjunction with the interval
parameter if this one is not set to zero. The value of <br>
count determines the number of reports generated at interval
seconds apart. If the interval parameter is specified
without the count parameter, the mpstat command generates
<br>
reports continuously.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-A This option is equivalent to specifying -u -I ALL -P
ALL</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I { SUM | CPU | SCPU | ALL }
<br>
Report interrupts statistics.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With the SUM keyword, the mpstat
command reports the total number of interrupts per
processor. The following values are displayed:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CPU <br>
Processor number. The keyword all indicates that statistics
are calculated as averages among all processors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">intr/s <br>
Show the total number of interrupts received per second by
the CPU or CPUs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With the CPU keyword, the number
of each individual interrupt received per second by the CPU
or CPUs is displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With the SCPU keyword, the
number of each individual software interrupt received per
second by the CPU or CPUs is displayed. This option works
only with kernels 2.6.31 and <br>
later.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ALL keyword is equivalent to
specifying all the keywords above and therefore all the
interrupts statistics are displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P { cpu [,...] | ON | ALL }
<br>
Indicate the processor number for which statistics are to be
reported. cpu is the processor number. Note that processor 0
is the first processor. The ON keyword indi&acirc; <br>
cates that statistics are to be reported for every online
processor, whereas the ALL keyword indicates that statistics
are to be reported for all processors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u Report CPU utilization. The
following values are displayed:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CPU <br>
Processor number. The keyword all indicates that statistics
are calculated as averages among all processors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%usr <br>
Show the percentage of CPU utilization that occurred while
executing at the user level (application).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%nice <br>
Show the percentage of CPU utilization that occurred while
executing at the user level with nice priority.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%sys <br>
Show the percentage of CPU utilization that occurred while
executing at the system level (kernel). Note that this does
not include time spent servicing hardware and <br>
software interrupts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%iowait <br>
Show the percentage of time that the CPU or CPUs were idle
during which the system had an outstanding disk I/O
request.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%irq <br>
Show the percentage of time spent by the CPU or CPUs to
service hardware interrupts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%soft <br>
Show the percentage of time spent by the CPU or CPUs to
service software interrupts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%steal <br>
Show the percentage of time spent in involuntary wait by the
virtual CPU or CPUs while the hypervisor was servicing
another virtual processor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%guest <br>
Show the percentage of time spent by the CPU or CPUs to run
a virtual processor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%gnice <br>
Show the percentage of time spent by the CPU or CPUs to run
a niced guest.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%idle <br>
Show the percentage of time that the CPU or CPUs were idle
and the system did not have an outstanding disk I/O
request.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: On SMP machines a
processor that does not have any activity at all is a
disabled (offline) processor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Print version number then
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
The mpstat command takes into account the following
environment variable:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">S_TIME_FORMAT <br>
If this variable exists and its value is ISO then the
current locale will be ignored when printing the date in the
report header. The mpstat command will use the ISO 8601 <br>
format (YYYY-MM-DD) instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
mpstat 2 5 <br>
Display five reports of global statistics among all
processors at two second intervals.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mpstat -P ALL 2 5 <br>
Display five reports of statistics for all processors at two
second intervals.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
/proc filesystem must be mounted for the mpstat command to
work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Only a few activities are given
by the Linux kernel for each processor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/proc contains various files with system statistics.</p>
