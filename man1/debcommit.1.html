<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
debcommit - commit changes to a package</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
debcommit [options] [--all | files to commit]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
debcommit generates a commit message based on new text in
debian/changelog, and commits the change to a
package&rsquo;s repository. It must be run in a working copy
for the package. <br>
Supported version control systems are: cvs, git, hg
(mercurial), svk, svn (Subversion), baz, bzr, tla (arch),
darcs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-c, --changelog path <br>
Specify an alternate location for the changelog. By default
debian/changelog is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, --release <br>
Commit a release of the package. The version number is
determined from debian/changelog, and is used to tag the
package in the repository.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that svn/svk tagging
conventions vary, so debcommit uses svnpath(1) to determine
where the tag should be placed in the repository.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R, --release-use-changelog <br>
When used in conjunction with --release, if there are
uncommitted changes to the changelog then derive the commit
message from those changes rather than using the default
<br>
message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m text, --message text <br>
Specify a commit message to use. Useful if the program
cannot determine a commit message on its own based on
debian/changelog, or if you want to override the default
message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --noact <br>
Do not actually do anything, but do print the commands that
would be run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --diff <br>
Instead of committing, do print the diff of what would have
been committed if this option were not given. A typical
usage scenario of this option is the generation of patches
<br>
against the current working copy (e.g. when you don&rsquo;t
have commit access right).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C, --confirm <br>
Display the generated commit message and ask for
confirmation before committing it. It is also possible to
edit the message at this stage; in this case, the
confirmation <br>
prompt will be re-displayed after the editing has been
performed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e, --edit <br>
Edit the generated commit message in your favorite editor
before committing it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a, --all <br>
Commit all files. This is the default operation when using a
VCS other than git.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --strip-message,
--no-strip-message <br>
If this option is set and the commit message has been
derived from the changelog, the characters &quot;* &quot;
will be stripped from the beginning of the message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is set by default
and ignored if more than one line of the message begins with
&quot;[*+-] &quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--sign-commit, --no-sign-commit
<br>
If this option is set, then the commits that debcommit
creates will be signed using gnupg. Currently this is only
supported by git, hg, and bzr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--sign-tags, --no-sign-tags <br>
If this option is set, then tags that debcommit creates will
be signed using gnupg. Currently this is only supported by
git.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--changelog-info <br>
If this option is set, the commit author and date will be
determined from the Maintainer and Date field of the first
paragraph in debian/changelog. This is mainly useful <br>
when using debchange(1) with the --no-mainttrailer
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION VARIABLES <br>
The two configuration files /etc/devscripts.conf and
~/.devscripts are sourced by a shell in that order to set
configuration variables. Command line options can be used to
<br>
override configuration file settings. Environment variable
settings are ignored for this purpose. The currently
recognised variables are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEBCOMMIT_STRIP_MESSAGE <br>
If this is set to no, then it is the same as the
--no-strip-message command line parameter being used. The
default is yes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEBCOMMIT_SIGN_TAGS <br>
If this is set to yes, then it is the same as the
--sign-tags command line parameter being used. The default
is no.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEBCOMMIT_SIGN_COMMITS <br>
If this is set to yes, then it is the same as the
--sign-commit command line parameter being used. The default
is no.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEBCOMMIT_RELEASE_USE_CHANGELOG
<br>
If this is set to yes, then it is the same as the
--release-use-changelog command line parameter being used.
The default is no.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEBSIGN_KEYID <br>
This is the key id used for signing tags. If not set, a
default will be chosen by the revision control system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VCS SPECIFIC FEATURES <br>
tla / baz <br>
If the commit message contains more than 72 characters, a
summary will be created containing as many full words from
the message as will fit within 72 characters, followed by
<br>
an ellipsis.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each of the features described
below is applicable only if the commit message has been
automatically determined from the changelog.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">git If only a single change is
detected in the changelog, debcommit will unfold it to a
single line and behave as if --strip-message was used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Otherwise, the first change will
be unfolded and stripped to form a summary line and a commit
message formed using the summary line followed by a blank
line and the changes <br>
as extracted from the changelog. debcommit will then spawn
an editor so that the message may be fine-tuned before
committing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hg / darcs <br>
The first change detected in the changelog will be unfolded
to form a single line summary. If multiple changes were
detected then an editor will be spawned to allow the <br>
message to be fine-tuned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bzr If the changelog entry used
for the commit message closes any bugs then --fixes options
to &quot;bzr commit&quot; will be generated to associate the
revision and the bugs.</p>
