<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
panalysis.PLS - An example/tutorial script how to access
analysis tools</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
# run an analysis with your sequence in a local file <br>
./panalysis.PLS -n &rsquo;edit.seqret&rsquo;-w -r
sequence_direct_data=@/home/testdata/my.seq</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See more examples in the text
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
A client showing how to use
&quot;Bio::Tools::Run::Analysis&quot; module, a module for
executing and controlling local or remote analysis tools. It
also calls methods from the <br>
&quot;Bio::Tools::Run::AnalysisFactory&quot; module, a
module providing lists of available analyses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Primarily, this client is meant
as an example how to use analysis modules, and also to test
them. However, because it has a lot of options in order to
cover as many methods as <br>
possible, it can be also used as a fully functional
command-line client for accessing various analysis
tools.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Defining location and access
method <br>
&quot;panalysis.PLS&quot; is independent on the access
method to the remote analyses (the analyses running on a
different machines). The method used to communicate with the
analyses is <br>
defined by the &quot;-A&quot; option, with the default value
soap. The other possible values (not yet supported, but
coming soon) are corba and local.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each access method may have
different meaning for parameter &quot;-l&quot; defining a
location of services giving access to the analysis tools.
For example, the soap access expects a URL <br>
of a Web Service in the &quot;-l&quot; option, while the
corba access may find here a stringified Interoperable
Object Reference (IOR).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A default location for the soap
access is &quot;http://www.ebi.ac.uk/soaplab/services&quot;
which represents services running at European Bioinformatics
Institute on top of over hundred <br>
EMBOSS analyses (and on top of few others).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Available analyses <br>
&quot;panalysis.PLS&quot; can show a list of available
analyses (from the given location using given access
method). The &quot;-L&quot; option shows all analyses, the
&quot;-c&quot; option lists all available <br>
categories (a category is a group of analyses with similar
functionality or processing similar type of data), and
finally the &quot;-C&quot; option shows only analyses
available within the <br>
given category.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note, that all these functions
are provided by module
&quot;Bio::Tools::Run::AnalysisFactory&quot; (respectively,
by one of its access-dependent sub-classes). The module has
also a factory <br>
method &quot;create_analysis&quot; which is not used by this
script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Service <br>
A &quot;service&quot; is a higher level of abstraction of an
analysis tool. It understands a well defined interface
(module &quot;Bio::AnalysisI&quot;, a fact which allows this
script to be <br>
independent on the access protocol to various services.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The service name must be given
by the &quot;-n&quot; option. This option can be omitted
only if you invoked just the &quot;factory&quot; methods
(described above).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each service (representing an
analysis tool, a program, or an application) has its
description, available by using options &quot;-a&quot;
(analysis name, type, etc.), &quot;-i&quot;, &quot;-I&quot;
<br>
(specification of analysis input data, most important are
their names), and &quot;-o&quot;, &quot;-O&quot; (result
names and their types). The option &quot;-d&quot; gives the
most detailed description in the <br>
XML format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The service description is nice
but the most important is to use the service for invoking an
underlying analysis tool. For each invocation, the service
creates a &quot;job&quot; and feeds <br>
it with input data. There are three stages: (a) create a
job, (b) run the job, and (c) wait for its completion.
Correspondingly. there are three options: the &quot;-b&quot;
which just <br>
creates (builds) a job, the &quot;-x&quot; which creates a
job and executes it, and finally &quot;-w&quot; which
creates a job, runs it and blocks the client until the job
is finished. Always only <br>
one of these options is used (so it does not make sense to
use more of them, the &quot;panalysis.PLS&quot; priorities
them in the order &quot;-x&quot;, &quot;-w&quot;, and
&quot;-b&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All of these options take input
data from the command-line (see next section about it) and
all of them return (internally) an object representing a
job. There are many methods <br>
(options) dealing with the job objects (see one after next
section about them).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Last note in this section: the
&quot;-b&quot; option is actually optional - a job is
created even without this option when there are some input
data found on the command-line. You have to <br>
use it, however, if you do not pass any data to an analysis
tool (an example would be the famous
&quot;Classic::HelloWorld&quot; service).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Input data <br>
Input data are given as name/value pairs, put on the
command-line with equal sign between name and value. If the
value part starts with an un-escaped character
&quot;@&quot;, it is used as <br>
a local file name and the &quot;panalysis.PLS&quot; reads
the file and uses its contents instead. Examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">panalysis.PLS -n edit.seqret -w
-r <br>
sequence_direct_data=&rsquo;tatatctcccc&rsquo;
osformat=embl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">panalysis.PLS ... <br>
sequence_direct_data=@/my/data/my.seq</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The names of input data come
from the &quot;input specification&quot; that can be shown
by the &quot;-i&quot; or &quot;-I&quot; options. The input
specification (when using option &quot;-I&quot;) shows also
- for some <br>
inputs - a list of allowed values. The specification,
however, does not tell what input data are mutually
exclusive, or what other constrains apply. If there is a
conflict, an <br>
error message is produced later (before the job starts).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Input data are used when any of
the options &quot;-b&quot;, &quot;-x&quot;, or
&quot;-w&quot; is present, but option &quot;-j&quot; is not
present (see next section about this job option).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Job <br>
Each service (defined by a name given in the &quot;-n&quot;
option) can be executed one or more times, with the same,
but usually with different input data. Each execution
creates a job <br>
object. Actually, the job is created even before execution
(remember that option &quot;-b&quot; builds a job but does
not execute it yet).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any job, executed or not, is
persistent and can be used again later from another
invocation of the &quot;panalysis.PLS&quot; script. Unless
you explicitly destroy the job using option <br>
&quot;-z&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A job created by options
&quot;-b&quot;, &quot;-x&quot; and &quot;-w&quot; (and by
input data) can be accessed in the same
&quot;panalysis.PLS&quot; invocation using various
job-related options, the most important are <br>
&quot;-r&quot; and &quot;-R&quot; for retrieving results
from the finished job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, you can also re-create
a job created by a previous invocation. Assuming that you
know the job ID (the &quot;panalysis.PLS&quot; prints it
always on the standard error when a new <br>
job is created), use option &quot;-j&quot; to re-create the
job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">./panalysis.PLS -n
&rsquo;edit.seqret&rsquo; <br>
sequence_direct_data=@/home/testdata/my.seq</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It prints:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">JOB ID:
edit.seqret/bb494b:ef55e47c99:-8000</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Next invocation (asking to run
the job, to wait for its completion and to show job status)
can be:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">./panalysis.PLS -n
&rsquo;edit.seqret&rsquo; <br>
-j edit.seqret/bb494b:ef55e47c99:-800 <br>
-w -s</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">And again later another
invocation can ask for results:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">./panalysis.PLS -n
&rsquo;edit.seqret&rsquo; <br>
-j edit.seqret/bb494b:ef55e47c99:-800 <br>
-r</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here is a list of all job
options (except for results, they are in the next
section):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Job execution and termination
<br>
There are the same options &quot;-x&quot; and &quot;-w&quot;
for executing a job and for executing it and waiting for its
completion, as they were described above. But now, the
options act on a <br>
job given by the &quot;-j&quot; option, now they do not use
any input data from the command-line (the input data had to
be used when the job was created).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Additionally, there is a
&quot;-k&quot; option to kill a running job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Job characteristics <br>
Other options tell about the job status (&quot;-s&quot;,
about the job execution times (&quot;-t&quot; and
&quot;-T&quot;, and about the last available event what
happened with the job (&quot;-e&quot;). Note that <br>
the event notification is not yet fully implemented, so this
option will change in the future to reflect more
notification capabilities.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Results <br>
Of course, the most important on the analysis tools are
their results. The results are named (in the similar way as
the input data) and they can be retrieved all in one go
using <br>
option &quot;-r&quot; (so you do not need to know their
names actually), or by specifying (all or some) result names
using the &quot;-R&quot; option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a result does not exist
(either not yet, or the name is wrong) an undef value is
returned (no error message produced).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some results are better to save
directly into files instead to show them in the terminal
window (this applies to the binary results, mostly
containing images). The <br>
&quot;panalysis.PLS&quot; helps to deal with binary results
by saving them automatically to local files (actually it is
the module &quot;Bio::Tools::Run::Analysis&quot; and its
submodules who do <br>
help with the binary data).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">So why not to use a traditional
shell re-direction to a file? There are two reasons. First,
a job can produce more than one result, so they would be
mixed together. But mainly, <br>
because each result can consist of several parts whose
number is not known in advance and which cannot be mixed
together in one file. Again, this is typical for the binary
data <br>
returning images - an invocation can produce many
images.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;-r&quot; option
retrieves all available results and treat them as described
by the &rsquo;?&rsquo; format below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;-R&quot; option has a
comma-separated list of result names, each of the names can
be either a simple name (as specified by the &quot;result
specification&quot; obtainable using the &quot;-o&quot; or
<br>
&quot;-O&quot; options), or a equal-sign-separated
name/format construct suggesting what to do with the result.
The possibilities are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">result-name <br>
It prints given result on the standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">result-name=filename <br>
It saves the given result into given file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">result-name=@ <br>
It saves the given result into a file whose name is
automatically invented, and it guarantees that the same name
will not be used in the next invocation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">result=name=@template <br>
It saves the given result into a file whose name is given by
the &quot;template&quot;. The template can contain several
strings which are substituted before using it as the
filename:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any &rsquo;*&rsquo; <br>
Will be replaced by a unique number</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ANALYSIS or ${ANALYSIS} <br>
Will be replaced by the current analysis name</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$RESULT or ${RESULT} <br>
Will be replaced by the current result name</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">How to tell what to do with
results? Each result name</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Additionally, a template can be
given as an environment variable
&quot;RESULT_FILENAME_TEMPLATE&quot;. Such variable is used
for any result having in its format a simple &quot;?&quot;
or &quot;@&quot; <br>
character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">result-name=? <br>
It first decides whether the given result is binary or not.
Then, the binary results are saved into local files whose
names are automatically invented, the other results are <br>
sent to the standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">result-name=?template <br>
The same as above but the filenames for binary files are
deduced from the given template (using the same rules as
described above).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r <br>
-R report <br>
-R report,outseq <br>
-R Graphics_in_PNG=@ <br>
-R Graphics_in_PNG=@$ANALYSIS-*-$RESULT</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the result formatting
will be enriched in the future by using existing data type
parsers in bioperl.</p>
