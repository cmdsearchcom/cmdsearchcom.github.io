<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
A client showing how to use &quot;Bio::Tools::Run::Analysis&quot; module, a
  module for executing and controlling local or remote analysis tools. It also
  calls methods from the &quot;Bio::Tools::Run::AnalysisFactory&quot; module, a
  module providing lists of available analyses.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Primarily, this client is meant as an example how to use analysis modules, and
  also to test them. However, because it has a lot of options in order to cover
  as many methods as possible, it can be also used as a fully functional
  command-line client for accessing various analysis tools.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Defining_location_and_access_method"><a class="selflink" href="#Defining_location_and_access_method">Defining
  location and access method</a></h2>
&quot;panalysis.PLS&quot; is independent on the access method to the remote
  analyses (the analyses running on a different machines). The method used to
  communicate with the analyses is defined by the &quot;-A&quot; option, with
  the default value <i>soap</i>. The other possible values (not yet supported,
  but coming soon) are <i>corba</i> and <i>local</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Each access method may have different meaning for parameter &quot;-l&quot;
  defining a location of services giving access to the analysis tools. For
  example, the <i>soap</i> access expects a URL of a Web Service in the
  &quot;-l&quot; option, while the <i>corba</i> access may find here a
  stringified Interoperable Object Reference (IOR).
<div class="Pp"></div>
A default location for the <i>soap</i> access is
  &quot;http://www.ebi.ac.uk/soaplab/services&quot; which represents services
  running at European Bioinformatics Institute on top of over hundred EMBOSS
  analyses (and on top of few others).
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Available_analyses"><a class="selflink" href="#Available_analyses">Available
  analyses</a></h2>
&quot;panalysis.PLS&quot; can show a list of available analyses (from the given
  location using given access method). The &quot;-L&quot; option shows all
  analyses, the &quot;-c&quot; option lists all available categories (a category
  is a group of analyses with similar functionality or processing similar type
  of data), and finally the &quot;-C&quot; option shows only analyses available
  within the given category.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note, that all these functions are provided by module
  &quot;Bio::Tools::Run::AnalysisFactory&quot; (respectively, by one of its
  access-dependent sub-classes). The module has also a <i>factory</i> method
  &quot;create_analysis&quot; which is not used by this script.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Service"><a class="selflink" href="#Service">Service</a></h2>
A &quot;service&quot; is a higher level of abstraction of an analysis tool. It
  understands a well defined interface (module &quot;Bio::AnalysisI&quot;, a
  fact which allows this script to be independent on the access protocol to
  various services.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The service name must be given by the &quot;-n&quot; option. This option can be
  omitted only if you invoked just the &quot;factory&quot; methods (described
  above).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Each service (representing an analysis tool, a program, or an application) has
  its description, available by using options &quot;-a&quot; (analysis name,
  type, etc.), &quot;-i&quot;, &quot;-I&quot; (specification of analysis input
  data, most important are their names), and &quot;-o&quot;, &quot;-O&quot;
  (result names and their types). The option &quot;-d&quot; gives the most
  detailed description in the XML format.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The service description is nice but the most important is to use the service for
  invoking an underlying analysis tool. For each invocation, the service creates
  a &quot;job&quot; and feeds it with input data. There are three stages: (a)
  create a job, (b) run the job, and (c) wait for its completion.
  Correspondingly. there are three options: the &quot;-b&quot; which just
  creates (builds) a job, the &quot;-x&quot; which creates a job and executes
  it, and finally &quot;-w&quot; which creates a job, runs it and blocks the
  client until the job is finished. Always only one of these options is used (so
  it does not make sense to use more of them, the &quot;panalysis.PLS&quot;
  priorities them in the order &quot;-x&quot;, &quot;-w&quot;, and
  &quot;-b&quot;).
<div class="Pp"></div>
All of these options take input data from the command-line (see next section
  about it) and all of them return (internally) an object representing a job.
  There are many methods (options) dealing with the job objects (see one after
  next section about them).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Last note in this section: the &quot;-b&quot; option is actually optional - a
  job is created even without this option when there are some input data found
  on the command-line. You <i>have</i> to use it, however, if you do not pass
  any data to an analysis tool (an example would be the famous
  &quot;Classic::HelloWorld&quot; service).
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Input_data"><a class="selflink" href="#Input_data">Input
  data</a></h2>
Input data are given as name/value pairs, put on the command-line with equal
  sign between name and value. If the <i>value</i> part starts with an
  un-escaped character &quot;@&quot;, it is used as a local file name and the
  &quot;panalysis.PLS&quot; reads the file and uses its contents instead.
  Examples:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   panalysis.PLS -n edit.seqret -w -r
                 sequence_direct_data='tatatctcccc' osformat=embl
   panalysis.PLS ...
               sequence_direct_data=@/my/data/my.seq
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The names of input data come from the &quot;input specification&quot; that can
  be shown by the &quot;-i&quot; or &quot;-I&quot; options. The input
  specification (when using option &quot;-I&quot;) shows also - for some inputs
  - a list of allowed values. The specification, however, does not tell what
  input data are mutually exclusive, or what other constrains apply. If there is
  a conflict, an error message is produced later (before the job starts).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Input data are used when any of the options &quot;-b&quot;, &quot;-x&quot;, or
  &quot;-w&quot; is present, but option &quot;-j&quot; is not present (see next
  section about this job option).
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Job"><a class="selflink" href="#Job">Job</a></h2>
Each service (defined by a name given in the &quot;-n&quot; option) can be
  executed one or more times, with the same, but usually with different input
  data. Each execution creates a <i>job object</i>. Actually, the job is created
  even before execution (remember that option &quot;-b&quot; builds a job but
  does not execute it yet).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Any job, executed or not, is persistent and can be used again later from another
  invocation of the &quot;panalysis.PLS&quot; script. Unless you explicitly
  destroy the job using option &quot;-z&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A job created by options &quot;-b&quot;, &quot;-x&quot; and &quot;-w&quot; (and
  by input data) can be accessed in the same &quot;panalysis.PLS&quot;
  invocation using various job-related options, the most important are
  &quot;-r&quot; and &quot;-R&quot; for retrieving results from the finished
  job.
<div class="Pp"></div>
However, you can also re-create a job created by a previous invocation. Assuming
  that you know the job ID (the &quot;panalysis.PLS&quot; prints it always on
  the standard error when a new job is created), use option &quot;-j&quot; to
  re-create the job.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Example:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   ./panalysis.PLS -n 'edit.seqret'
                 sequence_direct_data=@/home/testdata/my.seq
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
It prints:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   JOB ID: edit.seqret/bb494b:ef55e47c99:-8000
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Next invocation (asking to run the job, to wait for its completion and to show
  job status) can be:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   ./panalysis.PLS -n 'edit.seqret'
                 -j edit.seqret/bb494b:ef55e47c99:-800
                 -w -s
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
And again later another invocation can ask for results:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   ./panalysis.PLS -n 'edit.seqret'
                 -j edit.seqret/bb494b:ef55e47c99:-800
                 -r
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Here is a list of all job options (except for results, they are in the next
  section):
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">Job execution and termination</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">There are the same options &quot;-x&quot; and
      &quot;-w&quot; for executing a job and for executing it and waiting for
      its completion, as they were described above. But now, the options act on
      a job given by the &quot;-j&quot; option, now they do not use any input
      data from the command-line (the input data had to be used when the job was
      created).
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Additionally, there is a &quot;-k&quot; option to kill a running job.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">Job characteristics</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Other options tell about the job status (&quot;-s&quot;,
      about the job execution times (&quot;-t&quot; and &quot;-T&quot;, and
      about the last available event what happened with the job
      (&quot;-e&quot;). Note that the event notification is not yet fully
      implemented, so this option will change in the future to reflect more
      notification capabilities.</dd>
</dl>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Results"><a class="selflink" href="#Results">Results</a></h2>
Of course, the most important on the analysis tools are their results. The
  results are named (in the similar way as the input data) and they can be
  retrieved all in one go using option &quot;-r&quot; (so you do not need to
  know their names actually), or by specifying (all or some) result names using
  the &quot;-R&quot; option.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If a result does not exist (either not yet, or the name is wrong) an undef value
  is returned (no error message produced).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Some results are better to save directly into files instead to show them in the
  terminal window (this applies to the <i>binary</i> results, mostly containing
  images). The &quot;panalysis.PLS&quot; helps to deal with binary results by
  saving them automatically to local files (actually it is the module
  &quot;Bio::Tools::Run::Analysis&quot; and its submodules who do help with the
  binary data).
<div class="Pp"></div>
So why not to use a traditional shell re-direction to a file? There are two
  reasons. First, a job can produce more than one result, so they would be mixed
  together. But mainly, because each result can consist of several parts whose
  number is not known in advance and which cannot be mixed together in one file.
  Again, this is typical for the binary data returning images - an invocation
  can produce many images.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The &quot;-r&quot; option retrieves all available results and treat them as
  described by the '?' format below.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The &quot;-R&quot; option has a comma-separated list of result names, each of
  the names can be either a simple name (as specified by the &quot;result
  specification&quot; obtainable using the &quot;-o&quot; or &quot;-O&quot;
  options), or a equal-sign-separated name/format construct suggesting what to
  do with the result. The possibilities are:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">result-name</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">It prints given result on the standard output.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">result-name=filename</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">It saves the given result into given file.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">result-name=@</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">It saves the given result into a file whose name is
      automatically invented, and it guarantees that the same name will not be
      used in the next invocation.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">result=name=@template</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">It saves the given result into a file whose name is given
      by the &quot;template&quot;. The template can contain several strings
      which are substituted before using it as the filename:</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">Any '*'</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Will be replaced by a unique number</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">$ANALYSIS or ${ANALYSIS}</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Will be replaced by the current analysis name</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">$RESULT or ${RESULT}</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Will be replaced by the current result name
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    How to tell what to do with results? Each result name</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Additionally, a template can be given as an environment variable
  &quot;RESULT_FILENAME_TEMPLATE&quot;. Such variable is used for any result
  having in its format a simple &quot;?&quot; or &quot;@&quot; character.</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">result-name=?</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">It first decides whether the given result is binary or not.
      Then, the binary results are saved into local files whose names are
      automatically invented, the other results are sent to the standard
    output.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">result-name=?template</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The same as above but the filenames for binary files are
      deduced from the given template (using the same rules as described
    above).</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Examples:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   -r
   -R report
   -R report,outseq
   -R Graphics_in_PNG=@
   -R Graphics_in_PNG=@$ANALYSIS-*-$RESULT
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that the result formatting will be enriched in the future by using existing
  data type parsers in bioperl.
