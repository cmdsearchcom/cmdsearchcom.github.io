mailcross - a cross-validation simulator for use with dbacl.

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>mailcross</b> automates the task of cross-validating email filtering and
  classification programs such as <b>dbacl</b>(1). Given a set of categorized
  documents, mailcross initiates simulation runs to estimate the classification
  errors and thereby permits fine tuning of the parameters of the classifier.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Cross-validation is a method which is widely used to compare the quality of
  classification and learning algorithms, and as such permits rudimentary
  comparisons between those classifiers which make use of <b>dbacl</b>(1) and
  <b>bayesol</b>(1), and other competing classifiers.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The mechanics of cross-validation are as follows: A set of pre-classified email
  messages is first split into a number of roughly equal-sized subsets. For each
  subset, the filter (by default, <b>dbacl</b>(1)) is used to classify each
  message within this subset, based upon having learned the categories from the
  remaining subsets. The resulting classification errors are then averaged over
  all subsets.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The results obtained by cross validation essentially do not depend upon the
  ordering of the sample emails. Other methods (see
  <b>mailtoe</b>(1),<b>mailfoot</b>(1)) attempt to capture the behaviour of
  classification errors over time.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>mailcross</b> uses the environment variables MAILCROSS_LEARNER and
  MAILCROSS_FILTER when executing, which permits the cross-validation of
  arbitrary filters, provided these satisfy the compatibility conditions stated
  in the ENVIRONMENT section below.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For convenience, <b>mailcross</b> implements a <b>testsuite</b> framework with
  predefined wrappers for several open source classifiers. This permits the
  direct comparison of <b>dbacl</b>(1) with competing classifiers on the same
  set of email samples. See the USAGE section below.
<div class="Pp"></div>
During preparation, <b>mailcross</b> builds a subdirectory named mailcross.d in
  the current working directory. All needed calculations are performed inside
  this subdirectory.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="EXIT_STATUS"><a class="selflink" href="#EXIT_STATUS">EXIT

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="USAGE"><a class="selflink" href="#USAGE">USAGE</a></h1>
The normal usage pattern is the following: first, you should separate your email
  collection into several categories (manually or otherwise). Each category
  should be associated with one or more folders, but each folder should not
  contain more than one category. Next, you should decide how many subsets to
  use, say 10. Note that too many subsets will slow down the calculations
  rapidly. Now you can type
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div class="Pp" style="margin-left: 5.00ex; text-indent: -5.00ex;">% mailcross
  prepare 10</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Next, for every category, you must add every folder associated with this
  category. Suppose you have three categories named <i>spam</i>, <i>work</i>,
  and <i>play</i>, which are associated with the mbox files <i>spam.mbox</i>,
  <i>work.mbox</i>, and <i>play.mbox</i> respectively. You would type
<div class="Pp"></div>
% mailcross add spam spam.mbox
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
% mailcross add work work.mbox
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
% mailcross add play play.mbox
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can now perform as many simulations as desired. Every cross validation
  consists of a learning, a running and a summarizing stage. These operations
  are performed on the classifier specified in the MAILCROSS_FILTER and
  MAILCROSS_LEARNER variables. By setting these variables appropriately, you can
  compare classification performance as you vary the command line options of
  your classifier(s).
<div class="Pp"></div>
% mailcross learn
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
% mailcross run
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
% mailcross summarize
<div class="Pp"></div>
The testsuite commands are designed to simplify the above steps and allow
  comparison of a wide range of email classifiers, including but not limited to
  <b>dbacl</b>. Classifiers are supported through wrapper scripts, which are
  located in the <i>/usr/share/dbacl/testsuite</i> directory.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The first stage when using the testsuite is deciding which classifiers to
  compare. You can view a list of available wrappers by typing:
<div class="Pp"></div>
% mailcross testsuite list
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that the wrapper scripts are NOT the actual email classifiers, which must
  be installed separately by your system administrator or otherwise. Once this
  is done, you can select one or more wrappers for the simulation by typing, for
  example:
<div class="Pp"></div>
% mailcross testsuite select dbaclA ifile
<div class="Pp"></div>
If some of the selected classifiers cannot be found on the system, they are not
  selected. Note also that some wrappers can have hard-coded category names,
  e.g. if the classifier only supports binary classification. Heed the warning
  messages.
<div class="Pp"></div>
It remains only to run the simulation. Beware, this can take a long time
  (several hours depending on the classifier).
<div class="Pp"></div>
% mailcross testsuite run
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
% mailcross testsuite summarize
<div class="Pp"></div>
Once you are all done with simulations, you can delete the working files, log
  files etc. by typing
<div class="Pp"></div>
% mailcross clean
<div class="Pp"></div>
The progress of the cross validation is written silently in various log files
  which are located in the <i>mailcross.d/log</i> directory. Check these in case
  of problems.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SCRIPT_INTERFACE"><a class="selflink" href="#SCRIPT_INTERFACE">SCRIPT
  INTERFACE</a></h1>
<b>mailcross testsuite</b> takes care of learning and classifying your prepared
  email corpora for each selected classifier. Since classifiers have widely
  varying interfaces, this is only possible by wrapping those interfaces
  individually into a standard form which can be used by <b>mailcross
  testsuite</b>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Each wrapper script is a command line tool which accepts a single command
  followed by zero or more optional arguments, in the standard form:
<div class="Pp"></div>
wrapper command [argument]...
<div class="Pp"></div>
Each wrapper script also makes use of STDIN and STDOUT in a well defined way. If
  no behaviour is described, then no output or input should be used. The
  possible commands are described below:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">filter</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">In this case, a single email is expected on STDIN, and a
      list of category filenames is expected in $2, $3, etc. The script writes
      the category name corresponding to the input email on STDOUT. No trailing
      newline is required or expected.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">learn</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">In this case, a standard mbox stream is expected on STDIN,
      while a suitable category file name is expected in $2. No output is
      written to STDOUT.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">clean</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">In this case, a directory is expected in $2, which is
      examined for old database information. If any old databases are found,
      they are purged or reset. No output is written to STDOUT.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">describe</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">IN this case, a single line of text is written to STDOUT,
      describing the filter's functionality. The line should be kept short to
      prevent line wrapping on a terminal.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">bootstrap</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">In this case, a directory is expected in $2. The wrapper
      script first checks for the existence of its associated classifier, and
      other prerequisites. If the check is successful, then the wrapper is
      cloned into the supplied directory. A courtesy notification should be
      given on STDOUT to express success or failure. It is also permissible to
      give longer descriptions caveats.</dd>

Right after loading, <b>mailcross</b> reads the hidden file .mailcrossrc in the
  $HOME directory, if it exists, so this would be a good place to define custom
  values for environment variables.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">MAILCROSS_FILTER</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This variable contains a shell command to be executed
      repeatedly during the running stage. The command should accept an email
      message on STDIN and output a resulting category name. It should also
      accept a list of category file names on the command line. If undefined,
      <b>mailcross</b> uses the default value MAILCROSS_FILTER=&quot;dbacl -T
      email -T xml -v&quot; (and also magically adds the -c option before each
      category).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">MAILCROSS_LEARNER</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This variable contains a shell command to be executed
      repeatedly during the learning stage. The command should accept a mbox
      type stream of emails on STDIN for learning, and the file name of the

      default value MAILCROSS_LEARNER=&quot;dbacl -H 19 -T email -T xml
      -l&quot;.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">

Cross-validation is a widely used, but ad-hoc statistical procedure, completely
