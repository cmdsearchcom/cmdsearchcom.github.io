<p style="margin-top: 1em">MAILCROSS(1) MAILCROSS(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
mailcross - a cross-validation simulator for use with
dbacl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
mailcross command [ command_arguments ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
mailcross automates the task of cross-validating email
filtering and classification programs such as dbacl(1).
Given a set of categorized documents, mailcross initiates
simula&acirc; <br>
tion runs to estimate the classification errors and thereby
permits fine tuning of the parameters of the classifier.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cross-validation is a method
which is widely used to compare the quality of
classification and learning algorithms, and as such permits
rudimentary comparisons between those <br>
classifiers which make use of dbacl(1) and bayesol(1), and
other competing classifiers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The mechanics of
cross-validation are as follows: A set of pre-classified
email messages is first split into a number of roughly
equal-sized subsets. For each subset, the filter <br>
(by default, dbacl(1)) is used to classify each message
within this subset, based upon having learned the categories
from the remaining subsets. The resulting classification
<br>
errors are then averaged over all subsets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The results obtained by cross
validation essentially do not depend upon the ordering of
the sample emails. Other methods (see
mailtoe(1),mailfoot(1)) attempt to capture the be&acirc;
<br>
haviour of classification errors over time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mailcross uses the environment
variables MAILCROSS_LEARNER and MAILCROSS_FILTER when
executing, which permits the cross-validation of arbitrary
filters, provided these satisfy <br>
the compatibility conditions stated in the ENVIRONMENT
section below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For convenience, mailcross
implements a testsuite framework with predefined wrappers
for several open source classifiers. This permits the direct
comparison of dbacl(1) with com&acirc; <br>
peting classifiers on the same set of email samples. See the
USAGE section below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">During preparation, mailcross
builds a subdirectory named mailcross.d in the current
working directory. All needed calculations are performed
inside this subdirectory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
mailcross returns 0 on success, 1 if a problem occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMANDS <br>
prepare size <br>
Prepares a subdirectory named mailcross.d in the current
working directory, and populates it with empty
subdirectories for exactly size subsets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">add category [FILE]... <br>
Takes a set of emails from either FILE if specified, or
STDIN, and associates them with category. All emails are
distributed randomly into the subdirectories of mail&acirc;
<br>
cross.d for later use. For each category, this command can
be repeated several times, but should be executed at least
once.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">clean Deletes the directory
mailcross.d and all its contents.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">learn For every previously built
subset of email messages, pre-learns all the categories
based on the contents of all the subsets except this one.
The command_arguments are <br>
passed to MAILCROSS_LEARNER.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">run For every previously built
subset of email messages, performs the classification based
upon the pre-learned categories associated with all but this
subset. The com&acirc; <br>
mand_arguments are passed to MAILCROSS_FILTER.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">summarize <br>
Prints statistics for the latest cross-validation run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">review truecat predcat <br>
Scans the last run statistics and extracts all the messages
which belong to category truecat but have been classified
into category predcat. The extracted messages are <br>
copied to the directory mailcross.d/review for perusal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">testsuite list <br>
Shows a list of available filters/wrapper scripts which can
be selected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">testsuite select [FILTER]...
<br>
Prepares the filter(s) named FILTER to be used for
simulation. The filter name is the name of a wrapper script
located in the directory /usr/share/dbacl/testsuite. Each
<br>
filter has a rigid interface documented below, and the act
of selecting it copies it to the mailcross.d/filters
directory. Only filters located there are used in the
simu&acirc; <br>
lations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">testsuite deselect [FILTER]...
<br>
Removes the named filter(s) from the directory
mailcross.d/filters so that they are not used in the
simulation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">testsuite run <br>
Invokes every selected filter on the datasets added
previously, and calculates misclassification rates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">testsuite status <br>
Describes the scheduled simulations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">testsuite summarize <br>
Shows the cross validation results for all filters. Only
makes sense after the run command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USAGE <br>
The normal usage pattern is the following: first, you should
separate your email collection into several categories
(manually or otherwise). Each category should be associated
<br>
with one or more folders, but each folder should not contain
more than one category. Next, you should decide how many
subsets to use, say 10. Note that too many subsets will <br>
slow down the calculations rapidly. Now you can type</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% mailcross prepare 10</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Next, for every category, you
must add every folder associated with this category. Suppose
you have three categories named spam, work, and play, which
are associated with the <br>
mbox files spam.mbox, work.mbox, and play.mbox respectively.
You would type</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% mailcross add spam spam.mbox
<br>
% mailcross add work work.mbox <br>
% mailcross add play play.mbox</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can now perform as many
simulations as desired. Every cross validation consists of a
learning, a running and a summarizing stage. These
operations are performed on the clas&acirc; <br>
sifier specified in the MAILCROSS_FILTER and
MAILCROSS_LEARNER variables. By setting these variables
appropriately, you can compare classification performance as
you vary the <br>
command line options of your classifier(s).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% mailcross learn <br>
% mailcross run <br>
% mailcross summarize</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The testsuite commands are
designed to simplify the above steps and allow comparison of
a wide range of email classifiers, including but not limited
to dbacl. Classifiers are <br>
supported through wrapper scripts, which are located in the
/usr/share/dbacl/testsuite directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first stage when using the
testsuite is deciding which classifiers to compare. You can
view a list of available wrappers by typing:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% mailcross testsuite list</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the wrapper scripts
are NOT the actual email classifiers, which must be
installed separately by your system administrator or
otherwise. Once this is done, you can <br>
select one or more wrappers for the simulation by typing,
for example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% mailcross testsuite select
dbaclA ifile</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If some of the selected
classifiers cannot be found on the system, they are not
selected. Note also that some wrappers can have hard-coded
category names, e.g. if the classifier <br>
only supports binary classification. Heed the warning
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It remains only to run the
simulation. Beware, this can take a long time (several hours
depending on the classifier).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% mailcross testsuite run <br>
% mailcross testsuite summarize</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once you are all done with
simulations, you can delete the working files, log files
etc. by typing</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% mailcross clean</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The progress of the cross
validation is written silently in various log files which
are located in the mailcross.d/log directory. Check these in
case of problems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SCRIPT INTERFACE <br>
mailcross testsuite takes care of learning and classifying
your prepared email corpora for each selected classifier.
Since classifiers have widely varying interfaces, this is
<br>
only possible by wrapping those interfaces individually into
a standard form which can be used by mailcross
testsuite.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each wrapper script is a command
line tool which accepts a single command followed by zero or
more optional arguments, in the standard form:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wrapper command
[argument]...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each wrapper script also makes
use of STDIN and STDOUT in a well defined way. If no
behaviour is described, then no output or input should be
used. The possible commands are <br>
described below:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">filter In this case, a single
email is expected on STDIN, and a list of category filenames
is expected in $2, $3, etc. The script writes the category
name corresponding to the <br>
input email on STDOUT. No trailing newline is required or
expected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">learn In this case, a standard
mbox stream is expected on STDIN, while a suitable category
file name is expected in $2. No output is written to
STDOUT.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">clean In this case, a directory
is expected in $2, which is examined for old database
information. If any old databases are found, they are purged
or reset. No output is written <br>
to STDOUT.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">describe <br>
IN this case, a single line of text is written to STDOUT,
describing the filter&rsquo;s functionality. The line should
be kept short to prevent line wrapping on a terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bootstrap <br>
In this case, a directory is expected in $2. The wrapper
script first checks for the existence of its associated
classifier, and other prerequisites. If the check is
suc&acirc; <br>
cessful, then the wrapper is cloned into the supplied
directory. A courtesy notification should be given on STDOUT
to express success or failure. It is also permissible <br>
to give longer descriptions caveats.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">toe Used by mailtoe(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">foot Used by mailfoot(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
Right after loading, mailcross reads the hidden file
.mailcrossrc in the $HOME directory, if it exists, so this
would be a good place to define custom values for
environment <br>
variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MAILCROSS_FILTER <br>
This variable contains a shell command to be executed
repeatedly during the running stage. The command should
accept an email message on STDIN and output a resulting
cat&acirc; <br>
egory name. It should also accept a list of category file
names on the command line. If undefined, mailcross uses the
default value MAILCROSS_FILTER=&quot;dbacl -T email -T <br>
xml -v&quot; (and also magically adds the -c option before
each category).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MAILCROSS_LEARNER <br>
This variable contains a shell command to be executed
repeatedly during the learning stage. The command should
accept a mbox type stream of emails on STDIN for learning,
<br>
and the file name of the category on the command line. If
undefined, mailcross uses the default value
MAILCROSS_LEARNER=&quot;dbacl -H 19 -T email -T xml
-l&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TEMPDIR <br>
This directory is exported for the benefit of wrapper
scripts. Scripts which need to create temporary files should
place them a the location given in TEMPDIR.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
The subdirectory mailcross.d can grow quite large. It
contains a full copy of the training corpora, as well as
learning files for size times all the added categories, and
various <br>
log files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WARNING <br>
Cross-validation is a widely used, but ad-hoc statistical
procedure, completely unrelated to Bayesian theory, and
subject to controversy. Use this at your own risk.</p>
