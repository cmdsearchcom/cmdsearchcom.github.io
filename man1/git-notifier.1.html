<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
git-notifier - script to be used with git as a post-receive
hook</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
git-notifier [options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
git-notifier is a script to be used with git as a
post-receive hook. Once installed, it emails out a summary
of all changes each time a user pushes an update to the
repository. <br>
Different from other similar scripts, git-notifier sends
exactly one email per change, each of which includes a
complete diff of all modifications as well as the set of
branches <br>
from which the new revision can be reached. The scripts
ensure that that each change is mailed out only exactly once
by keeping a state file of already reported revisions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition, git-notifier also
mails updates when branches or annotated tags are created or
removed; and it furthermore mails a revision summary if a
head moves to now include <br>
commits already reported previously (e.g., on
fast-forwards).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a commit message contains
[nodiff], the generated mail will not include a diff. If a
commit message contains [nomail], no mail will be send for
that change.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">git-notifier supports the
options below. Alternatively to giving them on the command
line, all of them can alse be set via git config
hooks.&lt;option&gt;. For example, to set a recip&acirc;
<br>
ient address, do git config hooks.mailinglist
git-updates@foo.com.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For full documentation, see the
homepage at: http://www.icir.org/robin/git-notifier/.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INSTALLATION <br>
The basic installation is simple: just run the script from
hooks/post-receive, as in:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#!/bin/sh</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/full/path/to/git-notifier</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, the script will send
its mails to the user running the git-notifier (i.e., the
one doing the update). As that&rsquo;s usually not the
desired recipient, an alternative <br>
email address can be specified via command line or git
options, see the mailinglist option below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
--allchanges &lt;branches&gt; <br>
Lists &lt;branches&gt; for which all changes made to them
should be mailed out as straight diffs to their previous
state, independent of whether the corresponding commit has
<br>
already been reported in the past. For merge commits, the
mails include the full diff (i.e., git&rsquo;s diff -m).
This might for example make sense for master if one wants to
<br>
closely track any modification applied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;branches&gt; is a list of
comma-separated names of heads to treat this way.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--branches &lt;branches&gt; <br>
Lists &lt;branches&gt; to include/exclude in reporting. By
default, all branches are included. If this option is
specified, only branches listed are included. Alternatively,
one <br>
can prefix a branch with - to exclude it: then all but the
excluded ones are reported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;branches&gt; is a list of
comma-separated names of heads to treat this way.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--config=PATH <br>
PATH to alternative configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--debug <br>
Run the script in debug mode, which means that it will (1)
log more verbosely and to stderr, and (2) run git-notifier
with the --debug and --noupdate options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--diff [rev1...] rev2 <br>
Mails out diffs between all revisions on the first
parent&rsquo;s way from rev1 to rev2. This option produces
output similar to that of a head moving forward which is
listed <br>
with --allchanges. If rev1 is skipped, rev2~1 is
assumed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is primarily for
debugging and retropective (re-)generation of this outut,
and does not change the current notifier state in any way.
The main difference to <br>
--manual is that it considers only revision on the first
parent&rsquo;s path, and mails out actual diffs between
these.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--emailprefix <br>
Specifies a prefix for the mails&rsquo; subject line. If the
prefix contain an %r, that will be replace with the
repositories name. Default is [git/%r]. Note that the name
of <br>
this option is compatible with some of other git
notification scripts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--hostname &lt;name&gt; <br>
Defines the hostname to use when building the repository
path shown in the notification mails. Default is the
canonical name of the system the script is running on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ignoreremotes <br>
If given, git-notifier will not report any commits that are
already known by any configured remote repository.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--gitbasedir=DIRECTORY <br>
Specifies a base DIRECTORY for the git repository. If not
given, the current directory is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
show help message and exit</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--link &lt;url&gt; <br>
Specifies a &lt;url&gt; that will be included into
notification mails for locating a changeset online. The
&lt;url&gt; can contain a %s placeholder that will be
replaced with the cor&acirc; <br>
responding git revision number. The &lt;url&gt; can also
contain an %r placeholder that will be replaced with the
name of the repository.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--log &lt;file&gt; <br>
Write logging information into the given &lt;file&gt;.
Default is git-notifier.log inside the repository.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--mailcmd &lt;command&gt; <br>
Specifies the command to use for sending mail. Default is
/usr/sbin/sendmail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--mailinglist &lt;address&gt;
<br>
Specifies the recipient for all generated mails. Default is
mailing to the system account that is running the
script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--mailserver &lt;host&gt; <br>
SMTP server to use for outgoing mails. Default is None, in
which case mail gets sent through the local sendmail (or
whatever --mailcmd defines alternatively).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--mailsubjectlen &lt;max&gt;
<br>
Limits subjects of generated mails to &lt;max&gt;
characters. Default os no limit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--manual [rev1..] rev2 <br>
Mails out notifications for all revisions on the way from
rev1 to rev2. If rev1 is skipped, rev2~1 is assumed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is primarily for
debugging and retropective (re-)generation of this output,
and does not change the current notifier state in any
way.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--maxage &lt;days&gt; <br>
Limits the age of commits to report. No commit older than
this many days will trigger a commit notification. Default
is 30 days; zero disables the age check.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--maxdiffsize &lt;size&gt; <br>
Limits the &lt;size&gt;of mails by giving a maximum number
of kilobytes that a diff may have. If the diff for a change
is larger than this value, a notification mail is still <br>
send out but the diff is excluded (and replaced with a note
saying so). Default is 50K.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--mergediffs &lt;branches&gt;
<br>
Lists &lt;branches&gt; for which merges should include the
full diff, including all changes that are already part of
branch commits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;branches&gt; is a list of
command-separated names of heads to treat this way.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--noupdate <br>
Does not update the internal state file, meaning that any
updates will be reported again next time the script is
run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--replyto &lt;email&gt; <br>
Adds a Reply-To: &lt;email&gt; header to outgoing mails.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--repouri=URI <br>
full URI for the repository</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--sender &lt;address&gt; <br>
Defines the sender &lt;address&gt; for all generated mails.
Default is the user doing the update (if gitolite is used,
that&rsquo;s the gitolite acccount doing the push, not the
sys&acirc; <br>
tem account running git-notifier.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--update-only <br>
Does not send out any mail notifications but still updates
the index. In other words, all recent changes will be marked
as &quot;seen&quot;, without reporting them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--users &lt;file&gt; <br>
This is only for installations using gitolite &lt;XXX&gt;,
for which the default sender address for all mails would
normally be the gitolite user account name of the person
<br>
doing the push. With this option, one can alternatively
specify a file that maps such account names to alternative
addresses, which will then be used as the sender for <br>
mails.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that even if --users is not
given, git-notifier will still look for such a file in
../conf/sender.cfg, relative to the top-level repository
directory. In other words, <br>
you can check a file sender.cfg containing the mappings into
gitolite&rsquo;s config/ directory and it should Just
Work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Shows program&rsquo;s version number and exit</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
git-notifier.conf</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is the git-notifier
configuration file, which provides system-wide default
configuration values. Configuration data is taken in the
following order of precedence:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. command-line options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. repository-specific
configuration (via git config hooks.&lt;option&gt;)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. this file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the default configuration
file shipped with git-notifier, options are specified with
their default value where possible, but are left commented.
Uncommented options <br>
override the default value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">../conf/sender.cfg</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is only for installations
using gitolite &lt;XXX&gt;, for which the default sender
address for all mails would normally be the gitolite user
account name of the person <br>
doing the push.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The file must consist of line of
the form &lt;gitolite-user&gt; &lt;sender&gt;, where sender
will be used for the mails and can include spaces. Empty
lines and lines starting with # <br>
are ignored. It&rsquo;s ok if for a user no entry is found,
in which case the default value will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, if there&rsquo;s a
gitolite user account &quot;joe&quot;, one could provide a
users file like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">joe Joe Smith
&lt;joe@foo.bar&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Now all mails triggered by Joe
will have the specified sender.</p>
