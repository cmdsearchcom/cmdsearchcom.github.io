<p>TRIAL(1) TRIAL(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
trial - run unit tests</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
trial [ options ] [ file | package | module | TestCase |
testmethod ] ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">trial --help | -h</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
trial loads and executes a suite of unit tests, obtained
from modules, packages and files listed on the command
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">trial will take either filenames
or fully qualified Python names as arguments. Thus
&lsquo;trial myproject/foo.py&rsquo;, &lsquo;trial
myproject.foo&rsquo; and &lsquo;trial
myproject.foo.SomeTest&acirc; <br>
Case.test_method&rsquo; are all valid ways to invoke
trial.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After running the given test
suite, the default test reporter prints a summary of the
test run. This consists of the word &quot;PASSED&quot; (if
all tests ran as expected) or &quot;FAILED&quot; (if <br>
any test behaved unexpectedly) followed by a count of the
different kinds of test results encountered. The possible
kinds of test results includes:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">successes <br>
Tests that passed all their assertions and completed without
error. These are marked &quot;PASSED&quot; in the normal
test output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">failures <br>
Tests that failed an assertion, called self.fail() or
explicitly raised self.failureException for some reason.
These are marked &quot;FAILED&quot; in the normal test
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">errors Tests that raised an
unexpected exception (including AssertionError), tests that
caused the tearDown() method to raise an exception, tests
that run for longer than the <br>
timeout interval, tests that caused something to call
twisted.python.log.err() without subsequently calling
self.flushLoggedErrors(), tests that leave the reactor in an
<br>
unclean state, etc. These are marked &quot;ERROR&quot; in
the normal test output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that because errors can be
caused after the actual test method returns, it is possible
for a single test to be reported as both an error and a
failure, and hence the <br>
total number of test results can be greater than the total
number of tests executed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">skips Tests that were skipped,
usually because of missing dependencies. These are marked
&quot;SKIPPED&quot; in the normal test output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">expectedFailures <br>
Tests that failed, but were expected to fail, usually
because the test is for a feature that hasn&rsquo;t been
implemented yet. These are marked &quot;TODO&quot; in the
normal test out&acirc; <br>
put.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unexpectedSuccesses <br>
Tests that should have been listed under expectedFailures,
except that for some reason the test succeeded. These are
marked &quot;SUCCESS!?!&quot; in the normal test output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-b, --debug <br>
Run the tests in the Python debugger. Also does post-mortem
debugging on exceptions. Will load &lsquo;.pdbrc&rsquo; from
current directory if it exists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B, --debug-stacktraces <br>
Report Deferred creation and callback stack traces</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--coverage <br>
Generate coverage information in the &lsquo;coverage&rsquo;
subdirectory of the trial temp directory
(&lsquo;_trial_temp&rsquo; by default). For each Python
module touched by the execution of the <br>
given tests, a file will be created in the coverage
directory named for the module&rsquo;s fully-qualified name
with the suffix &lsquo;.cover&rsquo;. For example, because
the trial test <br>
runner is written in Python, the coverage directory will
almost always contain a file named
&lsquo;twisted.trial.runner.cover&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each &lsquo;.cover&rsquo; file
contains a copy of the Python source of the module in
question, with a prefix at the beginning of each line
containing coverage information. For lines <br>
that are not executable (blank lines, comments, etc.) the
prefix is blank. For executable lines that were run in the
course of the test suite, the prefix is a number <br>
indicating the number of times that line was executed. The
string &lsquo;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&rsquo; prefixes
executable lines that were not executed in the course of the
test suite.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that this functionality
uses Python&rsquo;s sys.settrace() function, so tests that
call sys.settrace() themselves are likely to break
trial&rsquo;s coverage functionality.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--disablegc <br>
Disable the garbage collector for the duration of the test
run. As each test is run, trial saves the TestResult
objects, which means that Python&rsquo;s garbage collector
has <br>
more non-garbage objects to wade through, making each
garbage-collection run slightly slower. Disabling garbage
collection entirely will make some test suites complete <br>
faster (contrast --force-gc, below), at the cost of
increasing (possibly greatly) memory consumption. This
option also makes tests slightly more deterministic, which
might <br>
help debugging in extreme circumstances.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e, --rterrors <br>
Print tracebacks to standard output as soon as they
occur</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--force-gc <br>
Run gc.collect() before and after each test case. This can
be used to isolate errors that occur when objects get
collected. This option would be the default, except it <br>
makes tests run about ten times slower.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Print a usage message to standard output, then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help-reporters <br>
Print a list of valid reporters to standard output, then
exit. Reporters can be selected with the --reporter option
described below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help-reactors <br>
Print a list of possible reactors to standard output, then
exit. Not all listed reactors are available on every
platform. Reactors can be selected with the --reactor <br>
option described below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, --logfile logfile <br>
Direct the log to a different file. The default file is
&lsquo;test.log&rsquo;. logfile is relative to
_trial_temp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --dry-run <br>
Go through all the tests and make them pass without
running.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N, --no-recurse <br>
By default, trial recurses through packages to find every
module inside every subpackage. Unless, that is, you specify
this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--nopm Don&rsquo;t automatically
jump into debugger for post-mortem analysis of exceptions.
Only usable in conjunction with --debug.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--profile <br>
Run tests under the Python profiler.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, --reactor reactor <br>
Choose which reactor to use. See --help-reactors for a
list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--recursionlimit <br>
Set Python&rsquo;s recursion limit. See
sys.setrecursionlimit()</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--reporter <br>
Select the reporter to use for trial&rsquo;s output. Use the
--help-reporters option to see a list of valid
reporters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--spew Print an insanely verbose
log of everything that happens. Useful when debugging
freezes or locks in complex code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--tbformat format <br>
Format to display tracebacks with. Acceptable values are
&lsquo;default&rsquo;, &lsquo;brief&rsquo; and
&lsquo;verbose&rsquo;. &lsquo;brief&rsquo; produces
tracebacks that play nicely with Emacs&rsquo; GUD.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--temp-directory directory <br>
WARNING: Do not use this options unless you know what you
are doing. By default, trial creates a directory called
_trial_temp under the current working directory. When <br>
trial runs, it first deletes this directory, then creates
it, then changes into the directory to run the tests. The
log file and any coverage files are stored here. Use <br>
this option if you wish to have trial run in a directory
other than _trial_temp. Be warned, trial will delete the
directory before re-creating it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--testmodule filename <br>
Ask trial to look into filename and run any tests specified
using the Emacs-style buffer variable
&lsquo;test-case-name&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--unclean-warnings <br>
As of Twisted 8.0, trial will report an error if the reactor
is left unclean at the end of the test. This option is
provided to assist in migrating from Twisted 2.5 to <br>
Twisted 8.0 and later. Enabling this option will turn the
errors into warnings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u, --until-failure <br>
Keep looping the tests until one of them raises an error or
a failure. This is particularly useful for reproducing
intermittent failures.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Prints the Twisted version number and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--without-module modulenames
<br>
Simulate the lack of the specified comma-separated list of
modules. This makes it look like the modules are not present
in the system, causing tests to check the behavior <br>
for that configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z, --random [seed] <br>
Run the tests in random order using the specified seed.</p>
