<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ezstream &acirc; source client for Icecast with external
de-/encoder support</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ezstream [-hnqVv] -c configfile <br>
ezstream -s [playlist]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The ezstream utility is a source client for the Icecast
media streaming server. In its basic mode of operation, it
streams media files and data from standard input
&quot;as-is&quot; &acirc; such <br>
as Ogg Vorbis, Ogg Theora and MP3 &acirc; to a server. It
can also use various external decoders and encoders to
re-encode from one format to another, and stream the result.
The only <br>
requirement is that the external programs support writing to
or reading from standard input, and can be used from the
command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Command line parameters <br>
-c configfile <br>
Use the XML configuration in configfile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Print a summary of available
command line parameters with short descriptions and
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Normalize metadata strings by
removing excess whitespaces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Be more quiet. Suppress the
output that external programs send to standard error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s [playlist] <br>
Run ezstream as a line-based shuffling utility. If no
playlist argument is given, a list of media file names is
read from standard input instead of an input file. After
<br>
successfully reading the entire list, it is shuffled and
printed to standard output, and ezstream will exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Print the ezstream version
number and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Produce more verbose output
from ezstream. Use twice for even more verbose output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the -q and -v parameters
are provided simultaneously, an additional line of
information about the currently streamed file &acirc;
playlist position, approximate playing time and bit <br>
rate &acirc; is displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Runtime control <br>
On POSIX systems, ezstream offers limited runtime control
via signals. By sending a signal to the ezstream process,
e.g. with the kill(1) utility, a certain action will be
trig&acirc; <br>
gered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGHUP <br>
Rereads the playlist file after the track that is currently
streamed. If the playlist is not to be shuffled, ezstream
attempts to find the previously streamed file and con&acirc;
<br>
tinue with the one following it, or restarts from the
beginning of the list otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGUSR1 <br>
Skips the currently playing track and moves on to the next
in playlist mode, or restarts the current track when
streaming a single file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGUSR2 <br>
Triggers rereading of metadata for the stream by running the
program or script specified in &lt;metadata_progname/&gt;
(see below.) This is the only meaningful signal when
streaming <br>
from standard input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION FILE SYNTAX <br>
The ezstream utility uses a simple XML configuration file
format. It has a tree-like structure and is made up of XML
elements. Of all the possible XML features, only regular
ele&acirc; <br>
ments that contain text or other elements, and comments,
appear in an ezstream configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each element in the
configuration file consists of a start tag, its content and
an end tag. For example:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;filename&gt;playlist.m3u&lt;/filename&gt;
<br>
&lt;!-- XML comments look like this. --&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">XML CONFIGURATION <br>
In this section, each available element is listed and
described. Note that for this purpose, elements are
introduced in their short, i.e. empty form. In the
configuration file, <br>
they need to be used as start tag + content + end tag, like
in the introductory example shown above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Root element <br>
&lt;ezstream /&gt; <br>
(Mandatory.) The configuration file&rsquo;s root element. It
contains all other configuration elements.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Global configuration elements
<br>
Each of the global configuration elements have the
&lt;ezstream/&gt; element as their parent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;url /&gt; <br>
(Mandatory.) Specifies the location and mount point of the
Icecast server, to which the stream will be sent. The
content must be of the form http://server:port/mountpoint
For <br>
example:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;url&gt;http://example.com:8000/stream.ogg&lt;/url&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;sourceuser /&gt; <br>
(Optional.) Sets the source username for authentication with
the Icecast server. The default user (usually
&acirc;source&acirc;) is used if this element is not
provided.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;sourcepassword /&gt; <br>
(Mandatory.) Sets the source password for authentication
with the Icecast server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;format /&gt; <br>
(Mandatory.) This element has two different meanings,
depending on whether re-encoding is enabled or not. It
specifies the output format of the stream if re-encoding is
<br>
enabled. Otherwise, it specifies the input format of all
input files. Recognized and supported values for output
stream formats are VORBIS, MP3 and THEORA. Other values <br>
will be ignored and cause ezstream to simply pass through
the data, which may or may not work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;filename /&gt; <br>
(Mandatory.) Set the path and name of a single media file, a
playlist, the name of an external program (see below), or
the keyword stdin for streaming from standard input. <br>
Playlists are recognized by their filename extension and end
with either .m3u or .txt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A playlist consists of
filenames, one entry per line. Comments in playlists are
introduced by a &acirc;#&acirc; sign at the beginning of a
line and ignored by ezstream.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;playlist_program /&gt; <br>
(Optional.) Set to 1 (one) to indicate that the file in
&lt;filename/&gt; is actually an executable program or
script. If set to 0 (zero), &lt;filename/&gt; content is
assumed to be a <br>
media file, playlist file or the keyword stdin (the
default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See the SCRIPTING section for
details on how the playlist program must behave.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;shuffle /&gt; <br>
(Optional.) Set to 1 (one) to randomly shuffle the entries
of the playlist specified in &lt;filename/&gt;. Files are
played sequentially if set to 0 (zero) or when the
&lt;shuffle/&gt; <br>
element is absent. This option will be ignored if
&lt;playlist_program/&gt; is set to 1 (one.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;metadata_progname /&gt; <br>
(Optional.) Set the path and name of an executable program
or script that should be used by ezstream to set the
metadata of the stream. The program is automatically queried
<br>
when a new track is streamed, or whenever the SIGUSR2 signal
is received.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the
&lt;metadata_progname/&gt; element is present in the
configuration, no attempts will be made to read metadata
from files that are being streamed. If this behavior is not
<br>
desired, it should be removed or commented out in the
configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See the SCRIPTING section for
details on how the metadata program must behave.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;metadata_format /&gt; <br>
(Optional.) Set the format of the string that should be used
for the &acirc;@M@&acirc; placeholder when setting metadata
with an external program or script via
&lt;metadata_progname/&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See the METADATA section for
details on how metadata is handled by ezstream.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;stream_once /&gt; <br>
Set to 1 (one) in order to stream the content of
&lt;filename/&gt; only once, and to 0 (zero) for continuous
streaming (the default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;reconnect_tries /&gt; <br>
Set how many attempts should be made to reconnect to the
Icecast server in case the connection is interrupted. The
default is to try indefinitely, which is equal to setting
<br>
this configuration option to 0 (zero).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;svrinfoname /&gt; <br>
(Optional.) Set the name of the broadcast. Informational
only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;svrinfourl /&gt; <br>
(Optional.) Set the URL of the web site associated with the
broadcast. Informational only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;svrinfogenre /&gt; <br>
(Optional.) Set the genre of the broadcast. Informational
only, used for YP.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;svrinfodescription /&gt;
<br>
(Optional.) Set the description of the broadcast.
Informational only, used for YP.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;svrinfobitrate /&gt; <br>
(Optional.) Set the bit rate of the broadcast. This setting
is also purely informational and only used for YP. The value
is set by the user and not ezstream, and should <br>
match the bit rate of the stream.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;svrinfoquality /&gt; <br>
(Optional.) Set the quality setting of an Ogg Vorbis
broadcast. Informational only and needs to be set by the
user, used for YP.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;svrinfochannels /&gt; <br>
(Optional.) Set the number of audio channels in the
broadcast, e.g. 1 (one) for mono or 2 for stereo.
Informational only and needs to be set by the user, used for
YP.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;svrinfosamplerate /&gt; <br>
(Optional.) Set the sample rate of the broadcast.
Informational only and needs to be set by the user, used for
YP.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;svrinfopublic /&gt; <br>
(Optional.) Set to 1 (one) if the broadcast may be listed in
a public YP directory. If set to 0 (zero), the Icecast
server will not submit this stream to a YP directory, <br>
which is also the default if the &lt;svrinfopublic/&gt;
element is absent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;reencode /&gt; <br>
(Optional.) Element that contains child elements, which
specify if and how re-encoding should be done.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Re-encoding settings <br>
Each of the re-encoding configuration elements have the
&lt;reencode/&gt; element as their parent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;enable /&gt; <br>
Set to 1 (one) to enable re-encoding. If set to 0 (zero), no
re-encoding will be done, which is also the default if the
&lt;enable/&gt; element is absent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;encdec /&gt; <br>
Element that contains child elements, which specify how to
decode and encode a certain media file format for streaming.
Each format is described by a separate &lt;encdec/&gt;
ele&acirc; <br>
ment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Decoder/Encoder settings <br>
Each of the decoder/encoder configuration elements have the
&lt;encdec/&gt; element as their parent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;format /&gt; <br>
This element is used by ezstream to find the appropriate
encoder for the output stream format specified in the
&lt;format/&gt; element inside the global configuration. For
consis&acirc; <br>
tency reasons, it is recommended that this element is always
supplied, even for currently unsupported output formats,
with content such as VORBIS, MP3, THEORA, FLAC, et <br>
cetera.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;match /&gt; <br>
Set the filename extension used to identify a given media
file format. This allows ezstream to find the appropriate
decoder for a given file. Should be set to .mp3 for MP3,
<br>
.flac for FLAC, .ogg for Ogg Vorbis, and so on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;decode /&gt; <br>
Set the command to decode the specified media file format to
raw data and send it to standard output. During runtime, the
placeholder &acirc;@T@&acirc; is replaced with the name of
the <br>
media file, as it is specified in the &lt;filename/&gt;
element or contained in a playlist file. It should always be
enclosed in quotes, to prevent problems with filenames that
<br>
contain whitespaces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Metadata placeholders can be
used in the &lt;decode/&gt; element as well, for combined
de-/encoder programs that produce data that can be streamed.
See the METADATA section for <br>
details on how metadata is handled by ezstream.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, to decode Ogg
Vorbis files using the oggdec utility:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;decode&gt;oggdec -R -o -
&quot;@T@&quot;&lt;/decode&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;encode /&gt; <br>
Set the command to encode raw data, received from standard
input, to the specified stream format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Metadata placeholders can be
used in the &lt;encode/&gt; element. For details about using
metadata in ezstream, see below in the METADATA section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, to encode an Ogg
Vorbis stream using the quality setting 1.5 with the oggenc
utility:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;encode&gt;oggenc -r -q 1.5
-t &quot;@M@&quot; -&lt;/encode&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SCRIPTING <br>
The ezstream utility provides hooks for externally
controlled playlist and metadata management. This is done by
running external programs or scripts that need to behave in
ways <br>
explained here.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Common Rules <br>
- The program must be an executable file. <br>
- The program must write one line to standard output and
exit. <br>
- The program must not require arbitrary command line
options to function. A wrapper script must be used if there
is no other way.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Playlist Programs <br>
- The program must return only filenames, with one filename
per execution. <br>
- The program should not return an empty line unless
ezstream is supposed to know that the end of the playlist
has been reached. This is significant when the
&lt;stream_once/&gt; <br>
option is enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Metadata Programs <br>
- The program must not return anything (just a newline
character is okay) if it is called by ezstream with a
command line parameter that the program does not support.
<br>
- When called without command line parameters, the program
should return a complete string that should be used for
metadata. <br>
- When called with the command line parameter
&quot;artist&quot;, the program should return only the
artist information of the metadata. (Optional.) <br>
- When called with the command line parameter
&quot;title&quot;, the program should return only the title
information of the metadata. (Optional.) <br>
- The supplied metadata must be encoded in UTF-8.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">METADATA <br>
The main tool for handling metadata with ezstream is
placeholders in decoder and encoder commands that are
replaced with real content during runtime. The tricky part
is that one <br>
of the placeholders has to be handled differently, depending
on where the metadata comes from. This section will explain
each possible scenario.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Metadata Placeholders <br>
@T@ Replaced with the media file name. Required in
&lt;decode/&gt; and is available in
&lt;metadata_format/&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@M@ Replaced with a metadata
string. See below for a detailed explanation. Available in
&lt;decode/&gt; and &lt;encode/&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@a@ Replaced with the artist
information. Available in &lt;decode/&gt;, &lt;encode/&gt;
and &lt;metadata_format/&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@t@ Replaced with the title
information. Available in &lt;decode/&gt;, &lt;encode/&gt;
and &lt;metadata_format/&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@s@ Replaced with the string
returned by &lt;metadata_progname/&gt; when called without
any command line parameters. Available only in
&lt;metadata_format/&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The @M@ Placeholder <br>
While all other placeholders are simply replaced with
whatever data they are associated with, &acirc;@M@&acirc; is
context-sensitive. The logic used by ezstream is the
following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If (&rsquo;@M@ is
present&rsquo;) <br>
If (&rsquo;&lt;metadata_progname/&gt;&rsquo; AND
&rsquo;&lt;metadata_format/&gt;&rsquo;) <br>
Replace with format string result. <br>
Else <br>
If (NOT &rsquo;&lt;metadata_progname/&gt;&rsquo; AND
&rsquo;@t@ is present&rsquo;) <br>
Replace with empty string. <br>
else <br>
Replace with generated metadata string. <br>
Endif <br>
Endif <br>
Endif</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The generated metadata string
for &acirc;@M@&acirc; is of the format &acirc;Artist -
Title&acirc;, if both artist and title information is
available. If one of the two is missing, the available one
is <br>
displayed without a leading or trailing dash, e.g. just
&acirc;Artist&acirc;. If neither artist nor title are
available, the name of the media file &acirc; without its
file extension &acirc; is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Metadata Caveats <br>
It is possible to generate strange results with odd
combinations of placeholders, external metadata programs and
updates during runtime via SIGUSR2. If things start to
become just <br>
confusing, simplify.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Metadata updates during runtime
are done with a relatively broken feature of libshout.
Additional metadata information that is already present in
the stream sent via ezstream is <br>
usually destroyed and replaced with the new data. It is not
possible to properly discern between artist and title
information, which means that anything set with the SIGUSR2
fea&acirc; <br>
ture will continue to end up entirely in the
&quot;Title&quot; field of a stream.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Of all possible Ogg-based
streams, only Ogg Vorbis can have its metadata manipulated
by Icecast. Any attempt of ezstream to update other Ogg
metadata is actually a no-op.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">While ezstream tries to do its
best with relaying metadata accurately to Icecast, and
subsequently the listeners, different codesets and locales
can pose a problem. Especially <br>
when streaming MP3 files, it may help to explicitly set a
codeset to work with via the LC_CTYPE environment variable,
as ezstream assumes ID3v1 tags to be in the user&rsquo;s
current <br>
locale. Note that, even though support for different locales
is provided by ezstream, Icecast itself and the listening
clients also have a say in the matter. The only way to <br>
ensure consistent results with metadata in non-Ogg streams
is to use the characters available in the ISO-8859-1
codeset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">External encoders may put
additional, and possibly artificial, restrictions on valid
characters in metadata.</p>
