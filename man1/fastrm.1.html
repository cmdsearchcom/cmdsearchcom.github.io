<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
fastrm - Quickly remove a list of files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
fastrm [-de] [-c|-cI] [-s|-sM] [-u|-uN] base-directory</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
fastrm reads a list of either file names or storage API
tokens, one per line, from its standard input and removes
them. Storage API tokens are removed via the SMcancel() <br>
interface. fastrm does not delete files safely or with an
eye to security, but rather cuts every corner it can to
delete files as fast as it can. It should therefore never be
<br>
run on publically writable directories, or in any other
environment where a hostile party may control the directory
structure in which it is working.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a file name is not an
absolute path name, it is considered to be relative to
base-directory as given on the command line. The
base-directory parameter must be a simple <br>
absolute pathname (it must not contain multiple consecutive
slashes or references to the special directories
&quot;.&quot; or &quot;..&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fastrm is designed to be faster
than the typical &quot;| xargs rm&quot; pipeline when given
a sorted list of file names as input. For example, fastrm
will usually chdir(2) into a <br>
directory before removing files from it, meaning that if its
input is sorted, most names passed to unlink(2) will be
simple names. This can substantially reduce the operating
<br>
system overhead from directory lookups.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fastrm assumes that its input is
valid and that it is safe to call unlink(2) on every file
name it is given. As a safety measure, however, fastrm when
running as root will check <br>
with stat(2) that a file name doesn&rsquo;t specify a
directory before removing it. (In some operating systems,
root is allowed to unlink directories, even directories
which aren&rsquo;t <br>
empty, which can cause file system corruption.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The input to fastrm should
always be sorted -- or even better be in the order file
names are output by find(1) -- if speed is an issue and the
input isn&rsquo;t solely storage API <br>
tokens. (It deals fine with unsorted input, but is unlikely
to be any faster in that case than a simple &quot;| xargs
rm&quot; command.) Sorting may even slightly speed up the
removal of <br>
storage API tokens due to caching effects, since sorting
will tend to keep all of the tokens from a particular
storage method together.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Various additional optimizations
for removing files can be turned on and/or tuned with
options (see below). Which options will be most effective
depends heavily on the <br>
underlying structure of the file system, the way in which
directories are stored and searched, and similar, often
underdocumented, operating system implementation details.
The <br>
more sophisticated the underlying operating system and file
system, the more likely that it will already perform the
equivalent of these optimizations internally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-c[I] <br>
Controls when fastrm calls chdir(2). If the number of files
to be unlinked from a given directory is at least I, then
fastrm will change to that directory before unlinking <br>
those files. Otherwise, it will use either the absolute path
names or a path name relative to the current directory
(whichever is likely more efficient). The I parameter is
<br>
optional; if just -c is given, -c1 is assumed, which will
cause fastrm to always chdir before calling unlink(2). The
default is -c3. Use -c0 to prevent fastrm from ever <br>
using chdir(2).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Don&rsquo;t remove any files.
Instead, print a list of the files that would be removed to
standard output. Each line contains either the current
directory of fastrm at the time <br>
it would do the unlink and the relative path name it would
pass to unlink(2) as two fields separated by whitespace and
a &quot;/&quot;, the absolute path name (as a single field)
that <br>
would be passed to unlink(2), or the string
&quot;Token&quot; and the storage API token that would be
removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e Treat an empty input file as
an error. This is most useful when fastrm is last in a
pipeline after a preceding sort(1) command, ensuring that
fastrm will fail if the sort <br>
fails.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s[M] <br>
When -s is given and the number of files to remove in a
directory is greater than M, rather than remove files in the
order given, fastrm will open the directory and read it,
<br>
unlinking files in the order that they appear in the
directory. On systems with a per-process directory cache or
that use a linear search to find files in a directory, this
<br>
should make directory lookups faster. The M parameter is
optional; if just -s is given, -s5 is assumed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When this option is in effect,
fastrm won&rsquo;t attempt to remove files that it
doesn&rsquo;t see in the directory, possibly significantly
speeding it up if most of the files to be <br>
removed have already been deleted. However, using this
option requires fastrm to do more internal work and it also
assumes that the order of directory listings is stable in
<br>
the presence of calls to unlink(2) between calls to
readdir(3). This may be a dangerous assumption with some
sophisticated file systems (and in general this option is
only <br>
useful with file systems that use unindexed linear searches
to find files in directories or when most of the files to be
removed have already been deleted).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This optimization is off by
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u[N] <br>
Specifying this option promises that there are no symbolic
links in the directory tree from which files are being
removed. This allows fastrm to make an additional <br>
optimization to its calls to chdir(2), constructing a
relative path using &quot;../..&quot; and the like to pass
to chdir(2) rather than always using absolute paths. Since
this <br>
reduces the number of directory lookups needed with deeply
nested directory structures (such as that typically created
by traditional news spool storage), it can be a <br>
significant optimization, but it breaks horribly in the
presence of symbolic links to directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When -u is given, fastrm will
use at most N levels of &quot;..&quot; segments to construct
paths. N is optional; if just -u is given, -u1 is
assumed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This optimization is off by
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fastrm also accepts -a and -r
options, which do nothing at all except allow you to say
&quot;fastrm -usa&quot;, &quot;fastrm -usr&quot;, or
&quot;fastrm -user&quot;. These happen to often be
convenient sets <br>
of options to use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
fastrm exits with a status of zero if there were no
problems, and an exit status of 1 if something went wrong.
Attempting to remove a file that does not exist is not
considered <br>
a problem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
fastrm is typically invoked by INN via expirerm(8) using a
command like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fastrm -e &lt;patharticles in
inn.conf&gt; &lt; expire.list</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To enable all optimizations and
see the affect on the order of removal caused by -s,
use:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fastrm -d -s -e -u
&lt;patharticles&gt; &lt; expire.list</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If your file system has indexed
directory lookups, but you have a deeply nested directory
structure, you may want to use a set of flags like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fastrm -e -u3
&lt;patharticles&gt; &lt; expire.list</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">to strongly prefer relative
paths but not to use readdir(2) to order the calls to
unlink(2).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may want to edit expirerm(8)
to change the flags passed to fastrm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WARNINGS <br>
fastrm cuts corners and does not worry about security, so it
does not use chdir(2) safely and could be tricked into
removing files other than those that were intended if run on
a <br>
specially constructed file tree or a file tree that is being
modified while it is running. It should therefore never be
used with world-writable directories or any other <br>
directory that might be controlled or modified by an
attacker.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
fastrm defers opening the storage subsystem or attempting to
parse any INN configuration files until it encounters a
token in the list of files to remove. It&rsquo;s therefore
<br>
possible to use fastrm outside of INN as a general fast file
removal program.</p>
