fastrm - Quickly remove a list of files
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<b>fastrm</b> [<b>-de</b>] [<b>-c</b>|<b>-c</b><i>I</i>]
  [<b>-s</b>|<b>-s</b><i>M</i>] [ <b>-u</b>|<b>-u</b><i>N</i>]
  <i>base-directory</i>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>fastrm</b> reads a list of either file names or storage API tokens, one per
  line, from its standard input and removes them. Storage API tokens are removed
  via the <i>SMcancel()</i> interface. <b>fastrm</b> does not delete files
  safely or with an eye to security, but rather cuts every corner it can to
  delete files as fast as it can. It should therefore never be run on publically
  writable directories, or in any other environment where a hostile party may
  control the directory structure in which it is working.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If a file name is not an absolute path name, it is considered to be relative to
  <i>base-directory</i> as given on the command line. The <i>base-directory</i>
  parameter must be a simple absolute pathname (it must not contain multiple
  consecutive slashes or references to the special directories &quot;.&quot; or
  &quot;..&quot;).
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>fastrm</b> is designed to be faster than the typical &quot;| xargs rm&quot;
  pipeline when given a sorted list of file names as input. For example,
  <b>fastrm</b> will usually <i>chdir</i>(2) into a directory before removing
  files from it, meaning that if its input is sorted, most names passed to
  <i>unlink</i>(2) will be simple names. This can substantially reduce the
  operating system overhead from directory lookups.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>fastrm</b> assumes that its input is valid and that it is safe to call
  <i>unlink</i>(2) on every file name it is given. As a safety measure, however,
  <b>fastrm</b> when running as root will check with <i>stat</i>(2) that a file
  name doesn't specify a directory before removing it. (In some operating
  systems, root is allowed to unlink directories, even directories which aren't
  empty, which can cause file system corruption.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
The input to <b>fastrm</b> should always be sorted --&#x00A0;or even better be
  in the order file names are output by <i>find</i>(1)&#x00A0;-- if speed is an
  issue and the input isn't solely storage API tokens. (It deals fine with
  unsorted input, but is unlikely to be any faster in that case than a simple
  &quot;| xargs rm&quot; command.) Sorting may even slightly speed up the
  removal of storage API tokens due to caching effects, since sorting will tend
  to keep all of the tokens from a particular storage method together.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Various additional optimizations for removing files can be turned on and/or
  tuned with options (see below). Which options will be most effective depends
  heavily on the underlying structure of the file system, the way in which
  directories are stored and searched, and similar, often underdocumented,
  operating system implementation details. The more sophisticated the underlying
  operating system and file system, the more likely that it will already perform
  the equivalent of these optimizations internally.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-c</b>[<i>I</i>]</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Controls when <b>fastrm</b> calls <i>chdir</i>(2). If the
      number of files to be unlinked from a given directory is at least
      <i>I</i>, then <b>fastrm</b> will change to that directory before
      unlinking those files. Otherwise, it will use either the absolute path
      names or a path name relative to the current directory (whichever is
      likely more efficient). The <i>I</i> parameter is optional; if just
      <b>-c</b> is given, <b>-c1</b> is assumed, which will cause <b>fastrm</b>
      to always chdir before calling <i>unlink</i>(2). The default is
      <b>-c3</b>. Use <b>-c0</b> to prevent <b>fastrm</b> from ever using
      <i>chdir</i>(2).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-d</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Don't remove any files. Instead, print a list of the files
      that would be removed to standard output. Each line contains either the
      current directory of <b>fastrm</b> at the time it would do the unlink and
      the relative path name it would pass to <i>unlink</i>(2) as two fields
      separated by whitespace and a &quot;/&quot;, the absolute path name (as a
      single field) that would be passed to <i>unlink</i>(2), or the string
      &quot;Token&quot; and the storage API token that would be removed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-e</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Treat an empty input file as an error. This is most useful
      when <b>fastrm</b> is last in a pipeline after a preceding <i>sort</i>(1)
      command, ensuring that <b>fastrm</b> will fail if the sort fails.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-s</b>[<i>M</i>]</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">When <b>-s</b> is given and the number of files to remove
      in a directory is greater than <i>M</i>, rather than remove files in the
      order given, <b>fastrm</b> will open the directory and read it, unlinking
      files in the order that they appear in the directory. On systems with a
      per-process directory cache or that use a linear search to find files in a
      directory, this should make directory lookups faster. The <i>M</i>
      parameter is optional; if just <b>-s</b> is given, <b>-s5</b> is assumed.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    When this option is in effect, <b>fastrm</b> won't attempt to remove files
      that it doesn't see in the directory, possibly significantly speeding it
      up if most of the files to be removed have already been deleted. However,
      using this option requires <b>fastrm</b> to do more internal work and it
      also assumes that the order of directory listings is stable in the
      presence of calls to <i>unlink</i>(2) between calls to <i>readdir</i>(3).
      This may be a dangerous assumption with some sophisticated file systems
      (and in general this option is only useful with file systems that use
      unindexed linear searches to find files in directories or when most of the
      files to be removed have already been deleted).
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This optimization is off by default.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-u</b>[<i>N</i>]</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Specifying this option promises that there are no symbolic
      links in the directory tree from which files are being removed. This
      allows <b>fastrm</b> to make an additional optimization to its calls to
      <i>chdir</i>(2), constructing a relative path using &quot;../..&quot; and
      the like to pass to <i>chdir</i>(2) rather than always using absolute
      paths. Since this reduces the number of directory lookups needed with
      deeply nested directory structures (such as that typically created by
      traditional news spool storage), it can be a significant optimization, but
      it breaks horribly in the presence of symbolic links to directories.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    When <b>-u</b> is given, <b>fastrm</b> will use at most <i>N</i> levels of
      &quot;..&quot; segments to construct paths. <i>N</i> is optional; if just
      <b>-u</b> is given, <b>-u1</b> is assumed.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This optimization is off by default.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>fastrm</b> also accepts <b>-a</b> and <b>-r</b> options, which do nothing at
  all except allow you to say &quot;fastrm -usa&quot;, &quot;fastrm -usr&quot;,
  or &quot;fastrm -user&quot;. These happen to often be convenient sets of
  options to use.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="EXIT_STATUS"><a class="selflink" href="#EXIT_STATUS">EXIT
  STATUS</a></h1>
<b>fastrm</b> exits with a status of zero if there were no problems, and an exit
  status of 1 if something went wrong. Attempting to remove a file that does not
  exist is not considered a problem.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="EXAMPLES"><a class="selflink" href="#EXAMPLES">EXAMPLES</a></h1>
<b>fastrm</b> is typically invoked by INN via <i>expirerm</i>(8) using a command
  like:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    fastrm -e &lt;patharticles in inn.conf&gt; &lt; expire.list
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
To enable all optimizations and see the affect on the order of removal caused by
  <b>-s</b>, use:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    fastrm -d -s -e -u &lt;patharticles&gt; &lt; expire.list
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If your file system has indexed directory lookups, but you have a deeply nested
  directory structure, you may want to use a set of flags like:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    fastrm -e -u3 &lt;patharticles&gt; &lt; expire.list
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
to strongly prefer relative paths but not to use <i>readdir</i>(2) to order the
  calls to <i>unlink</i>(2).
<div class="Pp"></div>
You may want to edit <i>expirerm</i>(8) to change the flags passed to
  <b>fastrm</b>.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="WARNINGS"><a class="selflink" href="#WARNINGS">WARNINGS</a></h1>
<b>fastrm</b> cuts corners and does not worry about security, so it does not use
  <i>chdir</i>(2) safely and could be tricked into removing files other than
  those that were intended if run on a specially constructed file tree or a file
  tree that is being modified while it is running. It should therefore never be
  used with world-writable directories or any other directory that might be
  controlled or modified by an attacker.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="NOTES"><a class="selflink" href="#NOTES">NOTES</a></h1>
<b>fastrm</b> defers opening the storage subsystem or attempting to parse any
  INN configuration files until it encounters a token in the list of files to
  remove. It's therefore possible to use <b>fastrm</b> outside of INN as a
  general fast file removal program.
