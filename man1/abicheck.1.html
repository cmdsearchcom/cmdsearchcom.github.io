<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
abicheck - check application binaries for calls to private
or evolving symbols in libraries and for static linking of
some system libraries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
abicheck [-h] [-k] [-a] [-I] [-v] [-f listfile] [-o outfile]
[-p pattern] [-e pattern] [-j njobs] [-l library] [-L
ldpath] [(-s|-S) dbfile] [(-d|-D) dbfile] [-O dbfile] [-A
list&acirc; <br>
file] files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
abicheck is run on application binaries and issues warnings
whenever any of the following three conditions are
detected:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Private symbol
usage. Private symbols are functions or data variables in a
library package that are internal to that package. They are
used by the libraries in the package for <br>
internal communication and are not part of the API/ABI that
application developers should use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Evolving symbol
usage. Evolving symbols are functions or data variables in a
library package that are intended for developer consumption,
but have been marked as &quot;evolving&quot; or <br>
&quot;unstable&quot; in the sense that they may become
incompatible or disappear on a later release of the library
package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Static linking.
Static linking of system libraries (for example, libc.a)
into an application is generally not a good idea because the
system library code it &quot;locks&quot; into the <br>
application binary may become incompatible with later
releases of the system. abicheck attempts to detect static
linking of a few system libraries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default behavior is, for
each binary object checked, to examine direct calls from
that binary object only. The -l option allows the libraries
the binary object brings in to <br>
have their calls checked as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The following options are supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k Keep on checking binaries
even if there are serious errors (dynamic linker reports
unresolved symbols, ldd(1) failures, no symbols
detected).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Print out long form of
help.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Verbose. Print out additional
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f listfile <br>
The listfile is a file containing a list of binary objects
to check, one per line. This list is appended to any files
provided as arguments on the command line. If list&acirc;
<br>
file is &quot;-&quot;, then stdin is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o outfile <br>
Write output to outfile instead of stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p pattern <br>
Modify the version name pattern match labelling private
version sets. Default is /private/ using a case-insensitive
match.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a component of the regex
pattern contains two colons in a row: patt1::patt2, then
symbol-level matching will be activated by checking whether
version::symbol or <br>
library::symbol matches pattern (where the symbol name,
version (if any), and library basename are substituted for
symbol, version, and library). For example,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p
&rsquo;FOO_VERS.*::_foopriv&rsquo; <br>
or <br>
-p &rsquo;libfoo.so.*::_foopriv&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e pattern <br>
Same as -p but for &quot;evolving&quot; interfaces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L ldpath <br>
Set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable to ldpath
before invoking dynamic linker. Use -L &quot;&quot; to unset
LD_LIBRARY_PATH.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If one of the components of
ldpath is the string &quot;find&quot;, then all shared
libraries in files are found and their paths inserted into
the &quot;find&quot; location. Note that the <br>
order will random.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l library <br>
Add the basename or full pathname of the shared library
library to the list of objects to be checked for making
private calls. This option may occur more than once on the
<br>
command line and is additive. By default, only direct calls
from a binary to the system libraries are checked. The -l
switch allows checking of indirect calls e.g.: app <br>
-&gt; supportlib -&gt; systemlib.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a Loop through all of the
binaries before checking and collect the list of all shared
objects. Take the basename of each shared object found and
act as though it was speci&acirc; <br>
fied with the -l option option and then run the abicheck
checks. This way, calls from all &quot;application
internal&quot; objects are checked rather than just the
direct calls. <br>
(Useful when shared objects do not have their dependencies
recorded.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I Ignore shared libraries in
checking, only check executables. Compatible with -a,
libraries will be searched for first but then not
checked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d dbfile, -D dbfile <br>
Specify fallback flat-file symbol database for the dynamic
(public vs. private) test. These classifications will be
used if the library is not versioned (i.e. classifica&acirc;
<br>
tion does not exist in the library itself). Use -D to
indicate that only information from dbfile should be used.
Lines in dbfile can be of one of these forms:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">library|symbol <br>
library|class|symbol <br>
library|FILE=path</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">library must be the full path to
the library to be specified (it cannot be a basename).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first form marks symbol as
private.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The second form marks symbol
with class where class may be public, private, or
evolving.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The third form indicates the
file path should be opened on demand when library is first
encountered. File path contains lines of the first two forms
except for the <br>
library field. The third form is a speedup to avoid
processing many classification lines for libraries never
encountered in the run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O dbfile <br>
Specify an override file to modify the symbol classification
for the dynamic (public vs. private) test. The format for
the override file is like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">library|symbol|class</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The library can be the full path
or basename. If library is &quot;__SKIP__&quot; the symbol
will be ignored for any library it is found in. The class
can be &quot;public&quot;, &quot;private&quot;, <br>
&quot;evolving&quot;, or &quot;deleted&quot;. The
&quot;deleted&quot; class is special-cased, means the symbol
was deleted from the library on some release. The symbol
&quot;__ALL__&quot; for the &quot;deleted&quot; <br>
class means the entire library was deleted or is otherwise
unstable to use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">libfoo.so.1|__bar|private <br>
/lib/libxyz.so.1|baz|public <br>
__SKIP__|__fputwc_xpg5</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These settings override any
classification inside the library (from library versioning,
obtainable from pvs(1), etc).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A listfile <br>
Set the ABI libraries of interest to the libraries listed in
listfile (full pathnames, one per line). Only calls into
these libraries will be checked; all other library <br>
calls will be ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s dbfile, -S dbfile <br>
Specify more extensive symbol databases for the static
linking test. dbfile may be a comma separated list of files.
If a file is a static archive (lib*.a) it is pro&acirc; <br>
cessed to extract the symbols. Otherwise it is a database
file consisting of lines of the form symbol|library:module
for example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">shmat|/usr/lib/libc.a:shmsys.o
<br>
shmctl|/usr/lib/libc.a:shmsys.o <br>
shmdt|/usr/lib/libc.a:shmsys.o <br>
shmget|/usr/lib/libc.a:shmsys.o <br>
...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When all symbols in a module.o
are defined in the application, static linking of that
module (and corresponding library archive) is assumed. Use
-S to indicate that only <br>
the static link test should be performed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use -S int to do only the static
link check and using the internal database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use -s none or -S none to skip
the static linking check entirely.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-j njobs <br>
Run njobs in parallel as separate processes. Implies -k.
Primarily intended for multiple CPU machines where njobs
should be close to the number of processors. Output is <br>
collected in tmp files and printed all at once near the end
of the run as each job finishes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If njobs is &quot;-&quot;,
&quot;detect&quot;, or &quot;n&quot;, then njobs will be set
to a number depending on the number of processors on the
current machine (if that can be determined).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERANDS <br>
The following operands are supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">files A list of application
binary objects to check.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT <br>
There is one line per problem (there may be multiple
problems per binary checked) which look like the
following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no problems were found: <br>
filename: OK</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If private symbol usage: <br>
filename: PRIVATE (library:private_version) private_sym</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If evolving symbol usage: <br>
filename: EVOLVING (library:evolving_vers) evolving_sym</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If file statically linked in a
system archive library: <br>
filename: STATIC_LINK (archive)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If checking of the file was
skipped: <br>
filename: SKIP (reason)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Under use of the deleted class
in the -O override file option, these problems may be
found:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a symbol has been deleted
from the library on some release: <br>
filename: DELETED_SYM: symbol/library</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(library will be
&quot;unbound&quot; if the symbol was unbound)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If an entire library has been
deleted on some release or is otherwise unstable to use:
<br>
filename: UNSTABLE_LIB: library-soname = library-path</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(library-path may be &quot;file
not found&quot; if the library could not be found)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following problems will
cause a fatal error unless the -k option is used:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the dynamic linker could not
resolve N symbols when ldd -r was run: <br>
filename: UNBOUND_SYMBOLS: N</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the dynamic linker found no
dynamic bindings: <br>
filename: NO_BINDINGS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If ldd -r with
LD_DEBUG=files,bindings failed: <br>
filename: LDD_ERROR</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In these latter three cases run
ldd -r on the binary file for more information on what went
wrong (note that abicheck runs ldd -r with
LD_DEBUG=files,bindings set). On some sys&acirc; <br>
tems the dynamic linker will not process SUID programs with
LD_DEBUG set (this usually results in NO_BINDINGS in the
abicheck output).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that if you are running
abicheck on a shared library (for example, libfoo.so) that
has not been built with -l lib flags to record its library
dependencies, then the &quot;unbound <br>
symbols&quot; problem is very likely. There is not much that
can be done besides rebuilding the library or checking an
application binary that uses the library and using the -l
option <br>
of abicheck.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The following exit values are returned:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 No errors and no problems
found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 A fatal error occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 No fatal errors occurred, but
some binaries had problems detected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
Only ELF objects are checked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the -s -S -d and -O dbfiles
the &rsquo;#&rsquo; character starts a comment line in the
usual way.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unless one is using the
&quot;::&quot; custom matches supplied via the -p or -e
flags, abicheck can only check against system libraries that
have had symbol versioning applied to them <br>
(i.e. the private and/or evolving information recorded for
each symbol in the library itself). For more info about
symbol versioning, see the &quot;Solaris Linker and
Libraries Guide&quot; <br>
answerbook at the URL http://docs.sun.com/ab2/coll.45.13 and
the Commands/Version-Script section of the GNU linker
&quot;ld&quot; info page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default symbol version name
matching patterns are case insensitive matches to the
strings &quot;private&quot; and &quot;evolving&quot; for the
private and evolving cases, respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Odd filenames containing the
single-quote character or newline will be skipped; such
characters interfere with calling commands via the
shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To recurse directories use
find(1) and either collect the output to a file for use with
the -f option, or in a pipe in via:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">find ... | abicheck -f - ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
The program is dependent on the form of the runtime
linker&rsquo;s debug output. Since this output is intended
to be human readable rather than machine readable, abicheck
will break <br>
whenever the output format changes. On Solaris it is
possible that the Link Auditing C interface could be used to
avoid this problem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On Linux when ldd(1) is run on a
SUID binary, it (ldd and the dynamic-linker) will sometimes
actually run the binary. On Linux SUID/SGID binaries are
currently skipped even if <br>
the user is root; test unprivileged copies instead.</p>
