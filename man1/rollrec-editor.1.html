<p>ROLLREC-EDITOR(1) User Contributed Perl Documentation
ROLLREC-EDITOR(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
rollrec-editor - DNSSEC-Tools Rollrec GUI Editor</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
rollrec-editor [options] &lt;rollrec-file&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
rollrec-editor provides the capability for easy GUI-based
management of rollrec files. A rollrec file contains one or
more rollrec records. These records are used by the <br>
DNSSEC-Tools rollover utilities (rollerd, etc.) to describe
zones&rsquo; rollover state. Each zone&rsquo;s rollrec
record contains such information as the zone file, the
rollover phase, and <br>
logging level. rollrec files are text files and may be
edited by any text editor. rollrec-editor allows editing of
only those records a user should change and performs error
<br>
checking on the data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When rollrec-editor starts, a
window is created that has &quot;buttons&quot; for each
rollrec record in the given rollrec file. (In this
documentation, this window is called the Button <br>
Window.) Clicking on the buttons selects (or deselects) that
zone. After one or more zones are selected, one of several
commands may be executed. Commands allow modification <br>
and deletion of existing rollrec records, creation of new
rollrec records, merging of rollrec files, and verification
of file validity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rollrec-editor&rsquo;s commands
are available through the menus and most have a keyboard
accelerator. The commands are described below in the
COMMANDS section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a rollrec record is
selected for modification, a new window is created to hold
the editable fields of the record. The fields may be
modified in place. When editing is <br>
complete, the record is &quot;saved&quot;. This does not
save the modified rollrec into its on-disk file; the file
must be saved explicitly from the Button Window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As stated above, verification
checks are performed when saving an edited rollrec record.
One set of checks ensures that files and directories
associated with a zone actually <br>
exist. This check may be turned off at command start-up with
the -ignore-warns command line option. It may be modified
during execution with the &quot;Ignore Edit Warnings&quot;
menu <br>
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Button Window Layout <br>
The Button Window contains a button for each rollrec record
in the selected file. The buttons are arranged in a table
that with at least three columns. The number of columns <br>
may be set at command start-up with the -columns command
line option. It may be modified during execution with the
&quot;Columns in Button Window&quot; menu command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When setting the number of
columns, rollrec-editor minimizes the space required to
display the selected file&rsquo;s rollrec buttons. This will
sometimes cause the number of columns <br>
to differ from that requested.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, assume a rollrec
file has 12 rollrec records. The following table shows how
many rows and columns are given for each of the given column
selections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">column count rows columns <br>
1 12 1 <br>
2 6 2 <br>
3 4 3 <br>
4 3 4 <br>
5 3 4 <br>
6 2 6 <br>
7 2 6 <br>
8 2 6 <br>
9 2 6 <br>
10 2 6 <br>
11 2 6 <br>
12 1 12</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The actual rows and columns for
a requested column count will vary in order to allow a
&quot;best-fit&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UNDOING MODIFICATIONS <br>
The &quot;undo&quot; capability is not currently
implemented.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rollrec-editor has the ability
to reverse modifications it has made to a rollrec file. This
historical restoration will only work for modifications made
during a particular <br>
execution of rollrec-editor; modifications made during a
previous execution may not be undone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After a &quot;Save&quot;
operation, the data required for reversing modifications are
deleted. This is not the case for the &quot;Save As&quot;
operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
rollrec-editor supports the following options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-columns columns <br>
This option allows the user to specify the number of columns
to be used in the Button Window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ignore-warns <br>
This option causes rollrec-editor to ignore edit warnings
when performing validation checks on the contents of rollrec
records.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-no-filter <br>
This option turns off name filtering when rollrec-editor
presents a file-selection dialog for choosing a new rollrec
file. If this option is not given, then the file- <br>
selection dialog will only list regular files with a suffix
of .rrf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Version <br>
Displays the version information for rollrec-editor and the
DNSSEC-Tools package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMANDS <br>
rollrec-editor provides the following commands, organized by
menus: File, Edit, Commands, Rollrecs, and Options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File Menu <br>
The File Menu contains commands for manipulating rollrec
files and stopping execution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Open <br>
Open a new rollrec file. If the specified file does not
exist, the user will be prompted for the action to take. If
the user chooses the &quot;Continue&quot; action, then
rollrec- <br>
editor will continue editing the current rollrec file. If
the &quot;Quit&quot; action is selected, then rollrec-editor
will exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Save <br>
Save the current rollrec file. The data for the &quot;Undo
Changes&quot; command are purged, so this file will appear
to be unmodified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Nothing will happen if no
changes have been made.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Save As <br>
Save the current rollrec file to a name selected by the
user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Quit <br>
Exit rollrec-editor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Edit Menu <br>
The Edit Menu contains commands for general editing
operations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Undo Changes <br>
Reverse modifications made to the rollrec records. This is
only for the in-memory version of the rollrec file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Not currently implemented.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Commands Menu <br>
The Commands Menu contains commands for modifying rollrec
records.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">New Rollrec <br>
Create a new rollrec record. The user is given a new window
in which to edit the user-modifiable rollrec fields. A
button for the new rollrec record will be inserted into <br>
the Button Window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After editing is completed, the
&quot;Save&quot; button will add the new rollrec record to
the in-memory rollrec file. The file must be saved in order
to have the new rollrec added to <br>
the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Potentially erroneous conditions
will be reported to the user at save time. If the
ignore-warnings flag has been turned on, then these warnings
will not be reported. Errors <br>
(e.g., invalid log conditions) will always be reported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Delete Selected Rollrecs <br>
Delete the selected rollrec records. The buttons for each
selected record will be removed from the Button Window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Edit Selected Rollrecs <br>
Modify the selected rollrec records. For every record
selected for modification, the user is given a new window in
which to edit the user-modifiable rollrec fields. When <br>
the edit window goes away (after a &quot;Save&quot; or
&quot;Cancel&quot;), the rollrec record&rsquo;s button is
deselected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After editing is completed, the
&quot;Save&quot; button will add the new rollrec record to
the in-memory rollrec file. The file must be saved in order
to have the new rollrec added to <br>
the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Potentially erroneous conditions
will be reported to the user at save time. If the
ignore-warnings flag has been turned on, then these warnings
will not be reported. Errors <br>
(e.g., invalid log conditions) will always be reported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Rename Selected Rollrec <br>
Rename the selected rollrec record. The name in the
rollrec&rsquo;s &quot;roll&quot; or &quot;skip&quot; line
will be changed to the new name. Only one rollrec may be
renamed at a time, and it may <br>
not be edited while the rename is taking place.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the rollrec has been
modified, the new contents must be written to disk prior to
the rename happening. The user will be prompted to ensure
that this the user wishes to <br>
continue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Merge Rollrec Files <br>
Merge a rollrec file with the currently open rollrec file.
After a successful merge, the rollrec records in the second
file will be added to the end of the currently open <br>
rollrec file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If there are any rollrec name
collisions in the files, then the user will be asked whether
to continue with the merge or cancel it. If the merge
continues, then the <br>
conflicting rollrec records from the &quot;new&quot; file
will be discarded in favor of the currently open rollrec
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Verify Rollrec File <br>
Verify the validity of the rollrec file. The user-editable
fields in the open rollrec file are checked for validity. An
edit window is opened for each rollrec record that <br>
registers an error or warning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the ignore-warnings flag has
been turned on, then potentially erroneous conditions will
not be reported. Errors (e.g., invalid log conditions) will
always be reported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Summarize Problems <br>
Summarize the warning and error counts of the rollrec file.
Each rollrec record in the open rollrec file is checked for
validity. If any warnings or errors are found, a <br>
window is displayed that lists the name of each rollrec
record and its warning and error counts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the ignore-warnings flag has
been turned on, then potentially erroneous conditions will
not be reported. Errors (e.g., invalid log conditions) will
always be reported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">View Menu <br>
The View Menu contains miscellaneous commands for viewing
edit windows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Select All Rollrecs/Unselect All
Rollrecs <br>
Select or unselect all rollrec buttons. All the buttons in
the Button Window will be selected or unselected. If any of
the buttons are not selected, this command will cause <br>
all the buttons to become selected. If all of the buttons
are selected, this command will cause all the buttons to be
deselected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command is a toggle that
switches between Select All Rollrecs and Unselect All
Rollrecs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Reveal Rollrec Edit Windows <br>
Raise all rollrec edit windows. This command brings all
rollrec edit windows to the front so that any that are
hidden behind other windows will become visible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Close Rollrec Edit Windows <br>
Close all rollrec edit windows. This command closes and
deselects all rollrec edit windows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options Menu <br>
The Options Menu allows the user to set several options that
control rollrec-editor behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ignore Edit Warnings/Don&rsquo;t
Ignore Edit Warnings <br>
Certain operations perform validation checks on the contents
of rollrec records. Warnings and errors may be reported by
these checks. This option controls whether or not <br>
warnings are flagged during validation. If they are flagged,
then the operation will not continue until the warning
condition is fixed or the operation canceled. If the <br>
warnings are ignored, then the operation will complete
without the condition being fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command is a toggle that
switches between Ignore Edit Warnings mode and Don&rsquo;t
Ignore Edit Warnings mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Filter Name
Selection/Don&rsquo;t Filter Name Selection <br>
When opening rollrec files for editing or merging, a
file-selection dialog box is displayed to allow the user to
select a rollrec file. This option controls whether a <br>
filename filter is used by the dialog box. If Filter Names
Selection mode is used, then only regular files with a
suffix of .rrf will be displayed by the dialog box. If <br>
Don&rsquo;t Filter Name Selection mode is used, then all
regular files will be displayed by the dialog box.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command is a toggle that
switches between Filter Name Selection display and
Don&rsquo;t Filter Name Selection display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Columns in Button Window <br>
Set the number of columns used in the Button Window. See the
Button Window Layout section for more information on columns
in the Button Window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Help Menu <br>
The Help Menu contains commands for getting assistance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Help <br>
Display a help window.</p>
