<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
t.vect.algebra performs temporal and spatial overlay and
buffer functions on space time vector datasets (STVDS) by
using the temporal vector algebra. New STVDS can be created,
<br>
which are expressions of existing STVDS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROGRAM USE <br>
The module expects an expression as input parameter in the
following form:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;result = expression&quot;
<br>
The statement structure is similar to r.mapcalc, see
r.mapcalc. Where result represents the name of a space time
dataset (STVDS) that will contain the result of the
calculation <br>
that is given as expression on the right side of the
equality sign. These expression can be any valid or nested
combination of temporal operations and functions that are
pro&acirc; <br>
vided by the temporal vector algebra. <br>
The algebra provides methods for map selection from STDS
based on their temporal relations. It is also possible to
temporally shift maps, to create temporal buffer and to snap
<br>
time instances to create a valid temporal topology.
Furthermore expressions can be nested and evaluated in
conditional statements (if, else statements). Within
if-statements the <br>
algebra provides temporal variables like start time, end
time, day of year, time differences or number of maps per
time interval to build up conditions. These operations can
be <br>
assigned to space time datasets or to the results of
operations between space time datasets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The type of the input space time
datasets must be defined with the input parameter type.
Possible options are STRDS, STVDS or STR3DS. The default is
set to space time raster <br>
datasets (STRDS).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As default, topological
relationships between space time datasets will be evaluated
only temporal. Use the s flag to activate the additionally
spatial topology evaluation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The expression option must be
passed as quoted expression, for example: <br>
t.select expression=&quot;C = A : B&quot; <br>
Where C is the new space time raster dataset that will
contain maps from A that are selected by equal temporal
relationships to the existing dataset B in this case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TEMPORAL VECTOR ALGEBRA <br>
The temporal algebra provides a wide range of temporal
operators and functions that will be presented in the
following section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TEMPORAL RELATIONS <br>
Several temporal topology relations between registered maps
of space time datasets are supported: <br>
equals A ------ <br>
B ------ <br>
during A ---- <br>
B ------ <br>
contains A ------ <br>
B ---- <br>
starts A ---- <br>
B ------ <br>
started A ------ <br>
B ---- <br>
finishs A ---- <br>
B ------ <br>
finished A ------ <br>
B ---- <br>
precedes A ---- <br>
B ---- <br>
follows A ---- <br>
B ---- <br>
overlapped A ------ <br>
B ------ <br>
overlaps A ------ <br>
B ------ <br>
over booth overlaps and overlapped <br>
The relations must be read as: A is related to B, like - A
equals B - A is during B - A contains B</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Topological relations must be
specified in {} parentheses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TEMPORAL OPERATORS <br>
The temporal algebra defines temporal operators that can be
combined with other operators to perform spatio-temporal
operations. The temporal operators process the time
instances <br>
and intervals of two temporal related maps and calculate the
result temporal extent by five different possibilities. <br>
LEFT REFERENCE l Use the time stamp of the left space time
dataset <br>
INTERSECTION i Intersection <br>
DISJOINT UNION d Disjoint union <br>
UNION u Union <br>
RIGHT REFERENCE r Use the time stamp of the right space time
dataset</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TEMPORAL SELECTION <br>
The temporal selection simply selects parts of a space time
dataset without processing raster or vector data. The
algebra provides a selection operator : that selects parts
of a <br>
space time dataset that are temporally equal to parts of a
second one by default. The following expression <br>
C = A : B <br>
means: Select all parts of space time dataset A that are
equal to B and store it in space time dataset C. The parts
are time stamped maps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition the inverse
selection operator !: is defined as the complement of the
selection operator, hence the following expression <br>
C = A !: B <br>
means: select all parts of space time time dataset A that
are not equal to B and store it in space time dataset (STDS)
C.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To select parts of a STDS by
different topological relations to other STDS, the temporal
topology selection operator can be used. The operator
consists of the temporal selection <br>
operator, the topological relations, that must be separated
by the logical OR operator | and the temporal extent
operator. All three parts are separated by comma and
surrounded <br>
by curly braces: <br>
{&quot;temporal selection operator&quot;, &quot;topological
relations&quot;, &quot;temporal operator&quot;}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples: <br>
C = A {:, equals} B <br>
C = A {!:, equals} B <br>
We can now define arbitrary topological relations using the
OR operator &quot;|&quot; to connect them: <br>
C = A {:,equals|during|overlaps} B <br>
Select all parts of A that are equal to B, during B or
overlaps B. <br>
In addition we can define the temporal extent of the result
STDS by adding the temporal operator. <br>
C = A {:, during,r} B <br>
Select all parts of A that are during B and use the temporal
extents from B for C.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The selection operator is
implicitly contained in the temporal topology selection
operator, so that the following statements are exactly the
same: <br>
C = A : B <br>
C = A {:} B <br>
C = A {:,equal} B <br>
C = A {:,equal,l} B <br>
Same for the complementary selection: <br>
C = A !: B <br>
C = A {!:} B <br>
C = A {!:,equal} B <br>
C = A {!:,equal,l} B</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS <br>
Selection operations can be evaluated within conditional
statements. <br>
Note A and B can either be space time datasets or
expressions. The temporal relationship between the
conditions and the conclusions can be defined at the
beginning of the if <br>
statement. The relationship between then and else conclusion
must be always equal. <br>
if statement decision option temporal relations <br>
if(if, then, else) <br>
if(conditions, A) A if conditions are True; temporal
topological relation between if and then is equal. <br>
if(conditions, A, B) A if conditions are True, B otherwise;
temporal topological relation between if, then and else is
equal. <br>
if(topologies, conditions, A) A if conditions are True;
temporal topological relation between if and then is
explicit specified by topologies. <br>
if(topologies, conditions, A, B) A if conditions are True, B
otherwise; temporal topological relation between if, then
and else is explicit specified by topologies.</p>

end_minute(A) The minute of the end time [0 - 59] <br>
end_second(A) The second of the end time [0 - 59]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Comparison operator <br>
The conditions are comparison expressions that are used to
evaluate space time datasets. Specific values of temporal
variables are compared by logical operators and evaluated
for <br>
each map of the STDS and the related maps. For complex
relations the comparison operator can be used to combine
conditions: <br>
The structure is similar to the select operator with the
extension of an aggregation operator: <br>
{&quot;comparison operator&quot;, &quot;topological
relations&quot;, aggregation operator, &quot;temporal
operator&quot;} <br>
This aggregation operator (| or &amp;) define the behaviour
if a map is related the more than one map, e.g for the
topological relations &acirc;contains&acirc;. Should all
(&amp;) conditions for <br>
the related maps be true or is it sufficient to have any (|)
condition that is true. The resulting boolean value is then
compared to the first condition by the comparison
opera&acirc; <br>
tor (|| or &amp;&amp;). As default the aggregation operator
is related to the comparison operator: <br>
Comparison operator -&gt; aggregation operator: <br>
|| -&gt; | and &amp;&amp; -&gt; &amp; <br>
Examples: <br>
Condition 1 {||, equal, r} Condition 2 <br>
Condition 1 {&amp;&amp;, equal|during, l} Condition 2 <br>
Condition 1 {&amp;&amp;, equal|contains, |, l} Condition 2
<br>
Condition 1 {&amp;&amp;, equal|during, l} Condition 2
&amp;&amp; Condition 3 <br>
Condition 1 {&amp;&amp;, equal|during, l} Condition 2
{&amp;&amp;,contains, |, r} Condition 3</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hash operator <br>
Additionally the number of maps in intervals can be computed
and used in conditional statements with the hash (#)
operator. <br>
A{#, contains}B <br>
This expression computes the number of maps from space time
dataset B which are during the time intervals of maps from
space time dataset A. <br>
A list of integers (scalars) corresponding to the maps of A
that contain maps from B will be returned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C = if({equal}, A {#, contains}
B &gt; 2, A {:, contains} B) <br>
This expression selects all maps from A that temporally
contains at least 2 maps from B and stores them in space
time dataset C. The leading equal statement in the if
condition <br>
specifies the temporal relation between the if and then part
of the if expression. This is very important, so we do not
need to specify a global time reference (a space time <br>
dataset) for temporal processing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Furthermore the temporal algebra
allows temporal buffering, shifting and snapping with the
functions buff_t(), tshift() and tsnap() respectively. <br>
buff_t(A, size) Buffer STDS A with granule (&quot;1
month&quot; or 5) <br>
tshift(A, size) Shift STDS A with granule (&quot;1
month&quot; or 5) <br>
tsnap(A) Snap time instances and intervals of STDS A</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Single map with temporal extent
<br>
The temporal algebra can also handle single maps with time
stamps in the tmap function. <br>
tmap() <br>
For example: <br>
C = A {:,during} tmap(event) <br>
This statement select all maps from space time data set A
that are during the temporal extent of single map
&acirc;event&acirc;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Spatial vector operators <br>
The module supports the following boolean vector operations:
<br>
Boolean Name Operator Meaning Precedence Correspondent
function <br>

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
AND &amp; Intersection 1 (v.overlay operator=and) <br>
OR | Union 1 (v.overlay operator=or) <br>
DISJOINT OR + Disjoint union 1 (v.patch) <br>
XOR ^ Symmetric difference 1 (v.overlay operator=xor) <br>
NOT ~ Complement 1 (v.overlay operator=not) <br>
And vector functions: <br>
buff_p(A, size) Buffer the points of vector map layer A with
size <br>
buff_l(A, size) Buffer the lines of vector map layer A with
size <br>
buff_a(A, size) Buffer the areas of vector map layer A with
size</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Combinations of temporal, vector
and select operators <br>
We combine the temporal topology relations, the temporal
operators and the spatial/select operators to create
spatio-temporal vector operators: <br>
{&quot;spatial or select operator&quot; , &quot;list of
temporal relations&quot;, &quot;temporal operator&quot;
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For multiple topological
relations or several related maps the spatio-temporal
operators feature implicit aggregation. The algebra
evaluates the stated STDS by their temporal <br>
topologies and apply the given spatio temporal operators in
a aggregated form. If we have two STDS A and B, B has three
maps: b1, b2, b3 that are all during the temporal extent
<br>
of the single map a1 of A, then the following overlay
calculations would implicitly aggregate all maps of B into
one result map for a1 of A: <br>
C = A {&amp;, contains} B --&gt; c1 = a1 &amp; b1 &amp; b2
&amp; b3 <br>
Keep attention that the aggregation behaviour is not
symmetric: <br>
C = B {&amp;, during} A --&gt; c1 = b1 &amp; a1 <br>
c2 = b2 &amp; a1 <br>
c3 = b3 &amp; a1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples: <br>
Spatio-temporal intersect all maps from space time dataset A
with all maps from space time dataset B which have equal
time stamps and are temporary before Jan. 1. 2005 and store
<br>
them in space time dataset D. <br>
D = if(start_date(A) &lt; &quot;2005-01-01&quot;, A &amp; B)
<br>
Buffer all vector points from space time vector dataset A
and B with a distance of one and intersect the results with
overlapping, containing, during and equal temporal relations
<br>
to store the result in space time vector dataset D with
intersected time stamps. <br>
D = buff_p(A, 1)
{&amp;,overlaps|overlapped|equal|during|contains,i}
buff_p(B, 1) <br>
Select all maps from space time dataset B which are during
the temporal buffered space time dataset A with a map
interval of three days, else select maps from C and store
them in <br>
space time dataset D. <br>
D = if(contains, td(buff_t(A, &quot;1 days&quot;)) == 3, B,
C)</p>
