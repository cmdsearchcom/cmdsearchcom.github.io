PodLinkCheck parses Perl POD from a script, module or documentation and checks
  that &quot;L&lt;&gt;&quot; links within it refer to a known program, module,
  or man page.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    L&lt;foo&gt;          check module, pod or program &quot;foo&quot;
    L&lt;foo/section&gt;    and check section within the pod
    L&lt;bar(1)&gt;       check man page &quot;bar(1)&quot;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The command line is either individual files or whole directories. For a
  directory all the <i>.pl</i>, <i>.pm</i> and <i>.pod</i> files under it are
  checked. So for example to churn through all installed add-on modules,
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    podlinkcheck /usr/share/perl5
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Bad links are usually typos in the module name or section name, or sometimes
  &quot;L&lt;display|target&gt;&quot; parts the wrong way around. Occasionally
  there may be an &quot;L&lt;foo&gt;&quot; used where just markup
  &quot;C&lt;&gt;&quot; or &quot;I&lt;&gt;&quot; was intended.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Checks"><a class="selflink" href="#Checks">Checks</a></h2>
External links are checked by seeking the target <i>.pm</i> module or
  <i>.pod</i> documentation in the @INC path (per Pod::Find), or seeking a
  script (no file extension) in the usual executable &quot;PATH&quot;. A section
  name in a link is checked by parsing the POD in the target file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If a module is not installed in @INC or extra &quot;-I&quot; directories then
  its existence is also checked in the CPAN indexes with
  &quot;App::cpanminus&quot;, &quot;CPAN::SQLite&quot;, &quot;CPAN&quot; or
  &quot;CPANPLUS&quot;. Nothing is downloaded, just current data consulted. A
  warning is given if a section name in a link goes unchecked because it's on
  CPAN but not available locally.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If checking your own work then most likely you will have copies of
  cross-referenced modules installed (having compared or tried them). In that
  sense the CPAN index lookups are a fallback.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Manpage links are checked by asking the &quot;man&quot; program if it recognises
  the name, including any number part like chmod(2). A manpage can also satisfy
  what otherwise appears to be a POD link with no sub-section, since there's
  often some confusion between the two.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Internal_Links"><a class="selflink" href="#Internal_Links">Internal
  Links</a></h2>
Internal links are sometimes written
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    L&lt;SYNOPSIS&gt;                     # may be ambiguous
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
but the Perl 5.10 &quot;perlpodspec&quot; advice is to avoid ambiguity between
  an external module and a one-word internal section by writing a section with /
  or quotes,
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    See L&lt;/SYNOPSIS&gt; above.         # good
    See L&lt;&quot;SYNOPSIS&quot;&gt; above.        # good
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;podlinkcheck&quot; warns about &quot;L&lt;SYNOPSIS&gt;&quot; section
  links. But not if it's both an valid external module and internal section --
  because it's not uncommon to have a module name as a heading or item and an
  &quot;L&lt;&gt;&quot; link still meaning the external one.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Section_Name_Matching"><a class="selflink" href="#Section_Name_Matching">Section
  Name Matching</a></h2>
An &quot;L&lt;&gt;&quot; section name can use just the first word of an item or
  heading. This is how &quot;Pod::Checker&quot; behaves and it's good for
  &quot;perlfunc&quot; cross references where just the function name can be
  given without the full argument list of the &quot;=item&quot;. Eg.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    L&lt;perlfunc/split&gt;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The first word is everything up to the first whitespace. This doesn't come out
  very well on a target like &quot;=item somefun( ARG )&quot;, but it's how
  &quot;Pod::Checker&quot; 1.45 behaves. If the targets are your own then you
  might make the first word or full item something sensible to appear in an
  &quot;L&lt;&gt;&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If a target section is not found then &quot;podlinkcheck&quot; will try to
  suggest something close, eg. differing only in punctuation or upper/lower
  case. Some of the POD translators may ignore upper/lower case anyway, but it's
  good to write an &quot;L&lt;&gt;&quot; the same as the actual target.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    foo.pl:130:31: no section &quot;constructor&quot; in &quot;CHI&quot;
      (file /usr/share/perl5/CHI.pm)
      perhaps it should be &quot;CONSTRUCTOR&quot;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
For reference, numbered &quot;=item&quot; section names go in an
  &quot;L&lt;&gt;&quot; without the number. This is good since the numbering
  might change. If &quot;podlinkcheck&quot; suggests a number in a target then
  it may be a mistake in the target document. A numbered item should have the
  number alone on the &quot;=item&quot; and the section name as the next
  paragraph.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    =item 1.                        # good
    The First Thing                 # the section name
    Paragraph about this thing.
    =item 2. The Second Thing       # bad
    Paragraph about this next thing.
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The second item &quot;2. The Second Thing&quot; is not a numbered item for POD
  purposes, but rather text that happens to start with a number. Of course
  sometimes that's what you want, eg.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    =item 64 Bit Support
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;podlinkcheck&quot; uses &quot;Pod::Simple&quot; for parsing and so follows
  its interpretation of the various hairy &quot;L&lt;&gt;&quot; link forms. If
  an &quot;L&lt;&gt;&quot; appears to be mis-interpreted you might rewrite or
  add some escapes (like E&lt;sol&gt;) for the benefit of all translators which
  use &quot;Pod::Simple&quot;. In Perl 5.10 that includes the basic
  &quot;pod2man&quot;.

&quot;podchecker&quot; (the &quot;Pod::Checker&quot; module) checks internal
  links, but it doesn't check external links.
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;Test::Pod::LinkCheck&quot; is similar in a <i>.t</i> test framework. It
  uses some of PodLinkCheck but different reporting and a stricter approach to
  dubious POD.

&quot;App::cpanminus&quot; is checked first since it's a bsearch of
  <i>02packages.details.txt</i>, and &quot;CPAN::SQLite&quot; second since it's
  a database lookup. But if a target is not found there then the full
  &quot;CPAN&quot; and &quot;CPANPLUS&quot; caches are loaded and checked. This
  might use a fair bit of memory for a non-existent target, but it's also
  possible they're more up-to-date.
<div class="Pp"></div>
No attempt is made to tell which of the indexes is the most up-to-date. If a
  module has been renamed (bad) then it may still exist in an old index. The
  suggestion is to avoid having old stuff lying around (including old mirror
  files in &quot;App::cpanminus&quot;).
<div class="Pp"></div>
The code consulting &quot;CPAN.pm&quot; may need a tolerably new version of that
  module, maybe 1.61 circa Perl 5.8.0. On earlier versions its index is not
  used.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The line:column number reported for an offending &quot;L&lt;&gt;&quot; is found
  by some gambits extending what &quot;Pod::Simple&quot; normally records.
  There's a chance it could be a little off within the paragraph.
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;Pod::Simple&quot; prior to version 3.24 didn't allow dots &quot;.&quot; in
  man-page names, resulting in for example <i>login.conf</i>(5) being treated as
  a Perl module name not a man page name. If you have such links then
  &quot;Pod::Simple&quot; 3.24 up is recommended.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Directories are currently traversed using File::Find::Iterator. It follows
  symlinks but neither its version 0.4 nor PodLinkCheck guard against infinite
  descent into symlink cycles. The intention perhaps would be follow all
  symlinks to files, but follow to a directory just once as protection against
  cycles.
