<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ttcn3_logformat - TTCN-3 log file formatter utility</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ttcn3_logformat [ -i n ] [ -o outfile ] [ -s ] [ file.log ]
[ -n ] <br>
or <br>
ttcn3_logformat -v</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This manual page is a quick reference for the TTCN-3
logformat utility of the TTCN-3 Test Executor. The
ttcn3_logformat utility, which can be found in
$TTCN3_DIR/bin, reads the <br>
unformatted log file generated by test executor from its
standard input. It can split up the log into several files
based on the lines that are automatically logged at the
begin&acirc; <br>
ning or end of each test case. Furthermore, ttcn3_logformat
formats the sent and received messages in the log file. The
structured values are indented and each field is put into
<br>
a new line according to the braces and commas.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Available command line switches are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i n Sets the depth of each
indentation level to n characters. The default value is 4.
If the sent or received PDU is too complex and has too
deeply nested fields, this num&acirc; <br>
ber can be decreased to get more readable output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o outfile <br>
Places the output into file outfile. If the -s flag is also
set, only those parts of the log files will be written into
this file that were logged outside the test <br>
cases (i.e. in control part or on PTCs). If this option is
omitted, the formatted log will be printed to standard
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s If this option is set, the
entries that were recorded during the execution of a
particular test case will be saved in a separate file in
ttcn3_logformat working direc&acirc; <br>
tory. The name of this file will be identical to the name of
the test case. If the same test case is executed several
times after each other, the results of repeated <br>
test runs will be collected after each other. If the output
file contained some data before ttcn3_logformat was started
(e.g. the results of previous test run), the <br>
output file will be emptied and the old logs will be
destroyed. <br>
ttcn3_logformat recognizes any types of timestamps that can
be set in the [LOGGING] section of the configuration
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WARNING! This option is useless
when formatting the log files of PTCs, because these logs do
not contain the name of the testcase that the PTC belongs
to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n If this option is set,
newline and tab characters are not modified, they are
printed as and</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Prints version and license
key information and exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
TTCN3_DIR <br>
The installation directory where the uncompressed binary
package of TTCN-3 Test Executor can be found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TTCN3_LICENSE_FILE <br>

contains the personalized license key for the current user
or host.</p>
