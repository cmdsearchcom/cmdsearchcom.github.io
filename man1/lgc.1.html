The Logiweb compiler translates Logiweb pages from source format to a number of
  machine and human readable formats.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Pages may contain free text mixed with machine intelligible objects like
  computer programs, testsuites, and formal proofs. The compiler can compile
  embedded computer programs, run testsuites, and check the correctness of
  formal proofs.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The compiler takes a source file as input and produces a 'vector', a 'rack', and
  a 'rendering' as output. Source, vector, rack, and rendering all represent the
  same Logiweb page. The source format is suited for authoring of Logiweb pages
  using an ordinary text editor. The vector is a condensed representation suited
  for transmission over the Internet. The rack is a comprehensive representation
  suited for storing on a local disk. The rendering is a human readable
  representation suited for reading in a web browser.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The compiler assigns a world-wide unique 'reference' to each page it translates.
  A reference comprises around 30 bytes. Having the reference of a page one may
  retrieve the vector of the page via an untrusted network from an untrusted
  repository. This is so since the reference contains a RIPEMD-160 hash code
  which allows to verify the authenticity of the page.
<div class="Pp"></div>
References are expressed in 'mixed endian hexadecimal': Each byte is written
  with the most significant hex digit first, bytes are given in network byte
  order, and capital letters are used for the hex digits A to F.

While it is possible to give the following options on the command line, they are
  intended to be used in configuration files.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">--leap=leapspec</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Tell lgc that a leap second occurred or will occur at the
      given point in time. A leapspec has format

<div class="Pp"></div>
    </pre>
    The year, month, and day are given as a Gregorian date. Days go from UTC
      midnight to UTC midnight. The month and day have two digits. The year has
      four until year 9999. A leapspec indicates that the length of the given
      day is altered by the given amount (+1 second or -1 second). The leap
      affects the last minute of the last hour of the given UTC day. See LIST
      OPTIONS below on how to give this option more than once.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">--newline=value</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Tell lgc what host newline convention to use. Possible

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">--script=headline</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Tell lgc what line to start with when emitting an
      executable. Default is '#!/usr/bin/lgwam script'</dd>
</dl>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="LIST_OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#LIST_OPTIONS">LIST
  OPTIONS</a></h1>
The value of each option is a list of strings. Each command line option
  transforms the value of some option. The available transformations are: (1)
  Discard the current value and set the given option to a one element list
  containing the given string. (2) Add the given string in front of the given
  option. (3) Add the given string at the end of the given option. (4) Set the
  given option to the empty list. These four possibilities are illustrated in
  the following using the PATH variable as an example.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">-p xyzzy, --path=xyzzy</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Set PATH to a one element list containing xyzzy.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">+p foo, --path+foo</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Add foo in front of PATH. If given after the option above,
      the PATH now has value foo;xyzzy.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">++p bar, --path++bar</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Add bar at end of PATH. If given after the options above,
      the PATH now has value foo;xyzzy;bar.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">--path</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Set path to the empty list</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Options like HELP, VERSION, and so on have default value 'no'. Such options take
  effect when they differ from 'no'. As an example, -h translates to --help
  which sets HELP to the empty list which differs from 'no'.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Options like SITECONFIG, USERCONFIG, and RENDERING only use the first string in
  the list. As an example, '-s file' translates to '--siteconfig=file' which
  sets the first (and only) element of SITECONFIG to file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A source file foo given on the command line translate to --source=foo. The
  compiler only uses the first string of the SOURCE option.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The compiler processes the command line left to right. Long options are case
  insensitive. Short options are case sensitive. Short options are translated to
  long options before processing.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CONFIGURATION_FILES"><a class="selflink" href="#CONFIGURATION_FILES">CONFIGURATION
  FILES</a></h1>
The compiler processes options from the following sources in the order given.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">Compiled in defaults</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">These are the default values which can only be changed by
      recompiling lgc.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">Script defaults</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The compiler is itself a Logiweb script and may look like
      this:
    <pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>

lgc
execute
siteconfig=/etc/logiweb/lgc.conf
<div class="Pp"></div>
    </pre>
    The first five lines identify the lgc compiler. The remaining lines define
      options exactly like long options do on the command line except that the
      leading two hyphens are omitted. Blank lines and lines starting with a
      hashmark (#) are ignored. Lines may be ended by an arbitrary sequence of
      CR and LF characters.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">Site configuration file</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The site configuration file is treated like the option part
      of the script.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">User configuration file</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The user configuration file is treated like the site
      configuration file. The only difference between the two is that the site
      file is processed before the user file.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">Environment variables</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Environment options like LGC_FOO=xyzzy are treated as
      --FOO=xyzzy. Environment options can only be used for setting options to
      one-element lists of strings. As a special case, the environment variable
      HOME=xyzzy is treated as --HOME=xyzzy.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">Command line options</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">These were treated in great detail earlier in this man
      page.</dd>

<div class="Pp"></div>
Options from the six sources above are treated as one long list of option
  transformations. As an example, --path+foo on the command line adds foo in
  front of whatever the five other sources have defined PATH to be.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The compiler reads options once but process them three times: First for finding
  the value of SITECONFIG ignoring the site and user configuration files. Second
  for finding the value of USERCONFIG ignoring the user configuration file. And
  finally for finding the value of all the other options.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The compiler does not restrict the set of possible options to those it knows
  itself. Hence, 'lgc --foo=bar source' will define the FOO option to equal
  'bar'. Such user defined options can be picked up by user defined rendering
  functions in the source and may affect the outcome of rendering. Note that if
  the rendering is put on WWW this may expose the options used to the outside
  world. This includes the environment variable HOME and variables starting with
  LGC_. Use 'lgc --options' to see what might get exposed to the outside world.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="PATH_ITEMS"><a class="selflink" href="#PATH_ITEMS">PATH
  ITEMS</a></h1>
When looking up a page by name or reference, lgc considers the locations in
  NAMEPATH and PATH, respectively, one at a time as follows.
<div class="Pp"></div>
(1) If the item does not start with &quot;file:&quot; or &quot;http:&quot;, then
  &quot;file:&quot; is prepended.
<div class="Pp"></div>
(2) The item is divided in scheme and contents at the leftmost colon character.
  Hence, the scheme is either &quot;file&quot; or &quot;http&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
(3) If the scheme is &quot;file&quot; and the contents starts with a tilde, then
  the tilde is replaced by the value of $HOME.
<div class="Pp"></div>
(4) The rightmost colon character (if any) is replaced by the name (for
  NAMEPATH) or reference (for PATH) of the page. The reference is expressed in
  mixed endian hexadecimal.
<div class="Pp"></div>
(5) The page is looked up as a file or using http depending on the scheme. A
  page with extension .lgr is treated as a Logiweb rack. A page with extension
  .lgw is treated as a Logiweb vector. A page with extension .lgu is treated as
  an URL which points at the page to be fetched. That URL is supposed to have
  extension .lgr or .lgw or .lgu. The .lgu extension is intended for future uses
  involving CGI scripts.
<div class="Pp"></div>
As an example, if the item is ~/.logiweb/cache/:/page.lgr and the referenced
  page has reference 01AB then .logiweb/cache/01AB/page.lgr under the users home
  catalogue is retrieved and is interpretted as a Logiweb rack.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="FILES"><a class="selflink" href="#FILES">FILES</a></h1>
The site configuration file typically resides in /etc/logiweb/lgc.conf. It is
  considered to be blank if it does not exist.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The user configuration file typically resides in ~/.logiweb/lgc.conf. It is
  considered to be blank if it does not exist.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Example source files typically reside in /usr/share/doc/logiweb/examples.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Source files should have extension .lgs (this may become mandatory in the
  future).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Links to rendering output typically have no extension.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Logiweb vectors (compact representations of Logiweb pages suited for
  transmission over the internet) have extension .lgw.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Logiweb racks (precompiled representations of Logiweb pages suited for fast
  loading) have extension .lgr.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Logiweb pointers (page references in mixed endian hexadecimal) have extension
  .lgp.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Logiweb URL indirections have extension .lgu.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ENVIRONMENT"><a class="selflink" href="#ENVIRONMENT">ENVIRONMENT</a></h1>
For each long option there is an associated environment variable, c.f.
  CONFIGURATION FILES above. Furthermore, lgc may use the HOME environment
  variable.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SECURITY_CONSIDERATIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#SECURITY_CONSIDERATIONS">SECURITY
  CONSIDERATIONS</a></h1>
The HOME environment variable and environment variables starting with LGC_ may
  get exposed if rendering output is made available via WWW.
<div class="Pp"></div>
All transitively referenced pages are rendered locally. Local rendering may
  involve invokation of latex, bibtex, makeindex, and dvipdfm. Local rendering
  should occur in a chroot jail, but this has not yet been implemented. Thus:
  only reference trusted pages.
<div class="Pp"></div>
All pages may define executable code. Executables end up under the rendering
  directory. Such executables can do anything if they are invoked. The lgc
  compiler never itself invokes an executable, but an attacker could either
  persuade or fool you to run it or could exploit security holes in latex to do
  so. Thus: only reference trusted pages.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When loading a Logiweb vector, lgc uses the RIPEMD-160 hash function to verify
  the authenticity of the received vector. lgc makes no check of racks. Thus,
  only load racks from trusted places (typically your own harddisk and nowhere
  else).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Feel free to include locations like http://untrusted.com/:/vector.lgw in PATH.
  RIPEMD-160 will protect you. But never include .lgr references to untrusted
  places and never include references to untrusted places in NAMEPATH.
