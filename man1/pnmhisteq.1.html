<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This program is part of Netpbm(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pnmhisteq increases the contrast
of a PGM or PPM image through the technique of
&rsquo;histogram equalization.&rsquo;[1]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pnmhisteq computes a histogram
of the luminosity of the pixels in the image. It then
calculates a mapping between each luminosity and a new
luminosity such that it spreads out <br>
intensity levels around histogram peaks and compresses them
at troughs. I.e. it moves pixels around in the histogram so
as to make it flat. It applies that mapping to the <br>
input image to produce the output image. The effect of this
is that the image has equal numbers of pixels at each
possible intensity level, which means it uses the available
<br>
levels of intensity more efficiently and thereby has more
visible detail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mathematically, the luminosity
mapping is this: Assume the pixels are sorted by luminosity
into B buckets numbered from 0 (lowest luminosity) to B-1.
N[i] is the number of pix&acirc; <br>
els in bucket i. T is the total number of pixels (sum of
N[i] over all i). W is the luminosity of white.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pnmhisteq replaces an input
pixel whose luminosity falls into bucket j with one whose
luminosity is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">j <br>
--- <br>
&gt; (N[i] / T) * W <br>
/ <br>
--- <br>
i=0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Considering a grayscale image
for simplicity, this means that pixels in the most luminous
bucket become white. Pixels in the 10th per centile of
luminosity become 10% of white.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pnmhisteq maps a single
luminosity in the input to a single luminosity in the
output. That means if pixels A and B both have luminosity .2
in the input, and pixel A has luminos&acirc; <br>
ity .4 in the output, pixel B also has luminosity .4 in the
output. And since the luminosities in the input are not
continuous, the luminosities in the output aren&rsquo;t
either and <br>
pnmhisteq doesn&rsquo;t meet the ideal of having exactly the
same number of pixels of each luminosity in the output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you&rsquo;re processing a
related set of images, for example frames of an animation,
it&rsquo;s generally best to apply the same luminosity
mapping to every frame, since otherwise you&rsquo;ll <br>
get distracting frame-to-frame changes in the brightness of
objects. pnmhisteq&rsquo;s -wmap option allows you to save,
as a PGM image, the luminosity map it computes from an
image. <br>
The -rmap option causes pnmisteq to use such an image as its
luminosity map.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">So you can run pnmhisteq with
-wmap on a composite you created with pnmcat of the images
you intend to process. Then, you can run pnmisteq with -rmap
on each of the individual <br>
images, using the luminosity map you generated from the
composite.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use pnmhistmap to see the
result. Run a color image through ppmtopgm first so that you
see a histogram of the luminosity instead of histograms of
the three color components. It <br>
should generally show a flat histogram. But due to the
quantization effects described above, you might see high
bars interleaved with low bars, with the local average being
<br>
flat. To see local averages, use the -width option of
pnmhistmap.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
You can abbreviate any option to its shortest unique
prefix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-gray When processing a color
image, only gray pixels (those with identical red, green,
and blue values) are included in the histogram and modified
in the output image. This is <br>
a special purpose option intended for images where the
actual data are gray scale, with color annotations you
don&rsquo;t want modified. Weather satellite images that
show con&acirc; <br>
tinent outlines in color are best processed using this
option. The option has no effect when the input is a
graymap.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-rmap mapfile <br>
Process the image using the luminosity map specified by the
PGM file mapfile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The PGM image, usually created
by an earlier run of pnmhisteq with the -wmap option,
contains a single row with number of columns equal to the
maxval (greatest intensity <br>
value) of the image plus one. Each pixel in the image is
transformed by looking up its luminosity in the
corresponding column in the map file (column number =
luminosity) <br>
and changing it to the value given by that column.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-wmap mapfile <br>
Creates a PGM file mapfile, containing the luminosity map
computed from the histogram of the input image. This map
file can be read on subsequent runs of pnmhisteq with <br>
the -rmap option, allowing a group of images to be processed
with an identical map.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-verbose <br>
Prints the histogram and luminosity map on Standard
Error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LIMITATIONS <br>
Histogram equalization is effective for increasing the
visible detail in scientific imagery and in some
continuous-tone pictures. It is often too drastic, however,
for scanned <br>
halftone images, where it does an excellent job of making
halftone artifacts apparent. You might want to experiment
with pnmnorm and pnmgamma for more subtle contrast
enhance&acirc; <br>
ment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The luminosity map file supplied
by the -rmap option must have the same maxval as the input
image. This is always the case when the map file was created
by the -wmap option of <br>
pnmhisteq. If this restriction causes a problem, simply
adjust the maxval of the map with pamdepth to agree with the
input image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the input is a PBM file (on
which histogram equalization is an identity operation), the
only effect of passing the file through pnmhisteq will be
the passage of time.</p>
