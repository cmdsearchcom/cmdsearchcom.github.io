<p>KYUA-TESTER(1) BSD General Commands Manual
KYUA-TESTER(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
kyua-tester &acirc; Scriptable interface to interact with
test programs</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
kyua-tester [-g gid] [-t timeout] [-u uid] list test_program
<br>
kyua-tester [-g gid] [-t timeout] [-u uid] test [-v
var=value] test_program test_case result_file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This generic manual page does not correspond to any specific
binary. It describes the generic command-line interface
provided by all Kyua testers shipped by the
&acirc;kyua-testers&acirc; <br>
package, which all have names of the form
kyua-INTERFACE-NAME-tester.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The main goal of a kyua-tester
is to provide a scriptable interface to run a single test
case of a single test program in a generic manner. The
specific implementation of how to <br>
do this is up to the tester, as each kyua-tester binary
implements a specific test interface. The following binaries
are shipped with the &acirc;kyua-testers&acirc; package:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kyua-atf-tester(1) <br>
An implementation of kyua-tester that wraps tests that
follow the kyua-atf-interface(7) interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kyua-plain-tester(1) <br>
An implementation of kyua-tester that wraps tests that
follow the kyua-plain-interface(7) interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kyua(1) uses the various
kyua-tester binaries to execute tests that implement diverse
interfaces, without having to know about any of its
specifics. It is possible for other pack&acirc; <br>
ages to provide new testers that implement other interfaces
as long as the tester&rsquo;s command line complies to what
is described in this manual page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A kyua-tester implements a
typical command-line interface based on subcommands. The
tool takes a set of generic options first, a subcommand
name, a set of any options accepted by <br>
such subcommand, and a set of arguments to the
subcommand.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options apply to
all subcommands:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g gid GID of the user to switch
to before running the test case. Defaults to the current
GID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t timeout Seconds to allow the
test program to run before killing it. Defaults to 60.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u uid UID of the user to switch
to before running the test case. Defaults to the current
UID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Killing the tester should always
be a safe operation, resulting in the subsequent termination
of the test program being run and the cleanup of any used
resources.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Workflow <br>
The way kyua(1) uses the testers to interact with individual
test cases is the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. For every test program listed
in a kyuafile(5), execute the &acirc;list&acirc; subcommand
of the kyua-tester that matches the interface name in the
test program description.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. kyua(1) collects the test
cases returned in the previous step and checks if they are
runnable according to their metadata.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. For every test case collected
from the previous steps, execute the &acirc;test&acirc;
subcommand of the same kyua-tester used in the test case
listing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. Reinterpret the generic test
result and record it as necessary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The list subcommand <br>
The &acirc;list&acirc; subcommand extracts the list of test
cases that are part of the given test program in a
machine-parseable format. The test program should be
provided as an absolute <br>
pathname.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The format of the output is
described in kyua-tester-list(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The test subcommand <br>
The &acirc;test&acirc; subcommand executes a single test
case of a test program in a controlled manner, which means
that it is placed in its own subprocess and its own work
directory so that <br>
side-effects during execution are minimized.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the test is executed
successfully, the result_file is created following the
format described in kyua-tester-result(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the test crashes halfway
through and dumps core, kyua-tester will attempt to gather a
stacktrace and print it as part of the test&rsquo;s
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options are
specific to the test command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v var=name Passes a
configuration variable to the test case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following configuration
variables have special meaning:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unprivileged-user The name (not
UID) of an unprivileged user that the test can use for its
own purposes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
The following variables are recognized and can be freely
tuned by the end user:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TMPDIR Path to the system-wide
temporary directory. kyua-tester uses this location to place
the work directory of test cases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default value is /tmp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
kyua-tester returns the following exit codes: <br>
0 The tester ran correctly and the test passed. <br>
1 The tester ran correctly, but the test failed. <br>
2 The tester failed. The result of the test itself is
irrelevant. <br>
3 The user invoked the tester incorrectly.</p>
