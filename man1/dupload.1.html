<p>DUPLOAD(1) Debian Project DUPLOAD(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
dupload - utility to upload Debian packages</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
dupload [options] [changes_file | dir] ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
dupload is a tool that enables Debian developers to easily
upload their packages to the Debian archive. At least for
chiark the upload procedure is somewhat error prone (upload
<br>
to Incoming/, move it to queue/).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dupload checks each non-option
argument to find readable files or directories. It parses
the files as .changes files, or tries to find such files in
the given directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dupload will warn if the name of
the file doesn&rsquo;t end with &quot;.changes&quot;.
Further processing is done chdir&rsquo;ed into the
directories of the changes files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dupload tests the available
checksums and size for each file listed in the .changes
file, and fails if it finds a mismatch. If all this goes
well, dupload checks if there is an <br>
.upload file with the basename of the .changes file. If the
file to be uploaded is recorded to have already been
uploaded to the specified host, it is skipped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dupload will stop and verify if
it sees you try to upload a package with a non-US Section
field to a host that is neither non-us.debian.org,
security.debian.org nor has the <br>
&quot;nonus&quot; option set to 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After the list of files to
upload is finished, dupload tries to connect to the server
and upload. Each successfully uploaded file is recorded in
the .upload log file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If all files of a package are
processed, the .changes file is mailed to the announcement
address specified in the configuration file. If files with
<br>
package.announce, package_UPSTREAMVER.announce, or <br>
package_UPSTREAMVER-DEBIANREV.announce exist, these files
get prepended to the announcement. UPSTREAMVER and DEBIANREV
are to be replaced with actual version numbers. For <br>
example, if your package is called foobar, has upstream
version 3.14, and Debian revision 2:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you only want the
announcement to be made with only ONE upload, you name it
foobar_3.14-2.announce.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want it to be made with
every upload of a particular upstream version, name it
foobar_3.14.announce.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want it made with every
upload of a given package, name it foobar.announce.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please note: Some mail readers
(like elm w/ PGP extensions) don&rsquo;t show mail contents
outside of the signed part of a message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Login and password <br>
If no login (username) is defined in the configuration file,
&quot;anonymous&quot; is used. The password is derived from
your login name and your hostname, which is common for
anonymous <br>
FTP logins. For anonymous logins only, you can provide the
&quot;password&quot; in the configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For logins other than
&quot;anonymous&quot;, you&rsquo;re asked for the password.
For security reasons there&rsquo;s no way to supply it via
the commandline or the environment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FTP / scp / rsync <br>
The default transfer method is FTP. Alternative methods are
scp/SSH and rsync/SSH. For scp and rsync, the default login
is taken from your local user name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The scp/SSH method only works
properly if no password is required (see ssh(1)). When you
use scp, it is recommended to set the &quot;method&quot;
keyword to &quot;scpb&quot;, which will transfer <br>
all files in a batch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are using an upload
queue, use FTP because it&rsquo;s fast. If you are using an
authenticated host, always use scp or rsync via SSH, because
FTP transmits the password in clear <br>
text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-d --debug [level] <br>
Enable more verbose output from the FTP module.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f --force Upload regardless of
the transfers logged as already completed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k --keep Keep going, skipping
packages whose checksums don&rsquo;t match.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c --configfile <br>
Read the file ./dupload.conf (if it exists). Warning: this
is a security risk if you are in a directory where other
people can write. That&rsquo;s why it is not the <br>
default (unlike the previous versions).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no Dry run, no files are
changed, no upload is attempted, only tell what we would
do.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--nomail Supress announcement
for this run. You can send it later by just calling dupload
again w/o this option. Note that this option is by default
implied for all hosts with <br>
the &quot;dinstall_runs&quot; option set to 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--mailonly Acts as if --no has
been specified and but sends the announcements,
unconditionally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--noarchive Adds a
&quot;X-No-Archive: yes&quot; header so that the
announcement will not be archived. You can use the per-host
&quot;archive&quot; option in the configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p --print Print the
&quot;database&quot; as read from the config files and exit.
If a host is specified via option --to, only this
host&rsquo;s entry is displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q --quiet Be quiet, i.e.
supress normal output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t --to nickname optional <br>
Upload to nickname&rsquo;d host. nickname is the key for
doing lookups in the config file. You can use the
&quot;default_host&quot; configuration option to specify a
host without <br>
--to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V --Version <br>
Prints version and exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
Configuration <br>
The configuration files are searched as follows (and read in
this order, overriding each other):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/dupload.conf <br>
~/.dupload.conf</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other <br>
Various Debian package files are used by dupload: .dsc,
.changes, .deb, .orig.tar.gz, .diff.gz</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dupload itself writes the log
file package_version-debian.upload, and the additional
announcement files package.announce,
package_upstreamver.announce, and <br>
package_upstreamver-debianrev.announce.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Announcement addresses <br>
By default, the announcement addresses are unset because
dinstall sends mails instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
dupload is tested on Debian systems only. It shouldn&rsquo;t
require too much effort to make it run under others systems,
though, it&rsquo;s written in Perl.</p>
