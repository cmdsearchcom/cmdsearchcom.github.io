dupload - utility to upload Debian packages
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<b>dupload</b> [<i>options</i>] [<i>changes_file</i> | <i>dir</i>] ...
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>dupload</b> is a tool that enables Debian developers to easily upload their
  packages to the Debian archive. At least for chiark the upload procedure is
  somewhat error prone (upload to Incoming/, move it to queue/).
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>dupload</b> checks each non-option argument to find readable files or
  directories. It parses the files as <i>.changes</i> files, or tries to find
  such files in the given directories.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>dupload</b> will warn if the name of the file doesn't end with
  &quot;.changes&quot;. Further processing is done chdir'ed into the directories
  of the changes files.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>dupload</b> tests the available checksums and size for each file listed in
  the <i>.changes</i> file, and fails if it finds a mismatch. If all this goes
  well, <b>dupload</b> checks if there is an <i>.upload</i> file with the
  basename of the <i>.changes</i> file. If the file to be uploaded is recorded
  to have already been uploaded to the specified host, it is skipped.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>dupload</b> will stop and verify if it sees you try to upload a package with
  a non-US Section field to a host that is neither non-us.debian.org,
  security.debian.org nor has the &quot;nonus&quot; option set to 1.
<div class="Pp"></div>
After the list of files to upload is finished, <b>dupload</b> tries to connect
  to the server and upload. Each successfully uploaded file is recorded in the
  <i>.upload</i> log file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If all files of a package are processed, the .changes file is mailed to the
  announcement address specified in the configuration file. If files with
<br/>
 <i>package</i>.announce, <i>package_UPSTREAMVER</i>.announce, or
<br/>
 <i>package_UPSTREAMVER-DEBIANREV</i>.announce exist, these files get prepended
  to the announcement. UPSTREAMVER and DEBIANREV are to be replaced with actual
  version numbers. For example, if your package is called <b>foobar</b>, has
  upstream version 3.14, and Debian revision 2:
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you only want the announcement to be made with only ONE upload, you name it
  foobar_3.14-2.announce.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you want it to be made with every upload of a particular upstream version,
  name it foobar_3.14.announce.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you want it made with <b>every</b> upload of a given package, name it
  foobar.announce.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Please note:</b> Some mail readers (like elm w/ PGP extensions) don't show
  mail contents outside of the signed part of a message.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Login_and_password"><a class="selflink" href="#Login_and_password">Login
  and password</a></h2>
If no login (username) is defined in the configuration file,
  &quot;anonymous&quot; is used. The password is derived from your login name
  and your hostname, which is common for anonymous FTP logins. For anonymous
  logins only, you can provide the &quot;password&quot; in the configuration
  file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For logins other than &quot;anonymous&quot;, you're asked for the password. For
  security reasons there's no way to supply it via the commandline or the
  environment.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="FTP_/_scp_/_rsync"><a class="selflink" href="#FTP_/_scp_/_rsync">FTP
  / scp / rsync</a></h2>
The default transfer method is FTP. Alternative methods are scp/SSH and
  rsync/SSH. For scp and rsync, the default login is taken from your local user
  name.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The scp/SSH method only works properly if no password is required (see
  <b>ssh</b>(1)). When you use scp, it is recommended to set the
  &quot;method&quot; keyword to &quot;scpb&quot;, which will transfer all files
  in a batch.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you are using an upload queue, use FTP because it's fast. If you are using an
  authenticated host, <b>always</b> use scp or rsync via SSH, because FTP
  transmits the password in clear text.

The configuration files are searched as follows (and read in this order,
  overriding each other):
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        /etc/dupload.conf
        ~/.dupload.conf
</pre>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Other"><a class="selflink" href="#Other">Other</a></h2>
Various Debian package files are used by <b>dupload</b>: .dsc, .changes, .deb,
  .orig.tar.gz, .diff.gz
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>dupload</b> itself writes the log file <i>package_version-debian</i>.upload,
  and the additional announcement files <i>package.announce</i>,
  <i>package_upstreamver.announce</i>, and
  <i>package_upstreamver-debianrev.announce</i>.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Announcement_addresses"><a class="selflink" href="#Announcement_addresses">Announcement
  addresses</a></h2>
By default, the announcement addresses are unset because dinstall sends mails
  instead.

<b>dupload</b> is tested on <b>Debian</b> systems only. It shouldn't require too
  much effort to make it run under others systems, though, it's written in Perl.
