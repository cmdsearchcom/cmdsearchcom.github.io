<p>STAR(1) Schily&Acirc;&acute;s USER COMMANDS STAR(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
star - unique standard tape archiver</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
star command [options] [-find] file1 ... filen [find_expr]
<br>
ustar command [options] [-find] file1 ... filen [find_expr]
<br>
tar command [options] file1 ... filen <br>
star -copy [options] [-find] file1 ... [f_expr] directory
<br>
star -copy [options] -C from_directory . to_directory</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Star is a very fast tar(1) like tape archiver with improved
functionality.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Star archives and extracts
multiple files to and from a single file called a tarfile. A
tarfile is usually a magnetic tape, but it can be any file.
In all cases, appearance of <br>
a directory name refers to the files and (recursively)
subdirectories of that directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Star&rsquo;s actions are
controlled by the mandatory command flags from the list
below. The way star acts may be modified by additional
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that unpacking tar archives
may be a security risk because star may overwrite existing
files. See SECURITY NOTES for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FEATURES <br>
Star includes the first free implementation of POSIX.1-2001
extended tar headers. The POSIX.1-2001 extended tar headers
define a new standard way for going beyond the limitations
<br>
of the historic tar format. They allow (among others) to
archive all UNIX time stamps in sub-second resolution, files
of arbitrary size and filenames without length limitation
<br>
using UNICODE UTF-8 coding for best exchange
compatibility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Star by default uses a fifo to
optimize data flow from/to tape. This results in a normally
streaming tape during the whole backup. See -fifo and fs=
option to get information on <br>
how to find the best fifo size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Star includes a pattern matcher
to control the list of files to be processed. This gives a
convenient interface for archiving and restoring complex
lists of files. In conjunction <br>
with the -w flag it is easy to merge a tar archive into an
existing file tree. See also -U option. In create mode use
the pat= option to specify either select or exclude
pat&acirc; <br>
terns (depending on the -V flag). In extract or list mode
all file type arguments are interpreted as select patterns
while the patterns specified with the pat= option may be
used <br>
as select or exclude patterns (depending on the -V flag).
Have a look at the description of the -C option to learn how
to fetch files from a list of directories (in create mode)
<br>
or to distribute files to a list of directories (in extract
mode). A substitute option allows ed(1) like pattern
substitution in file names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Star includes an enhanced
function that is similar to the find(1) command (see
sfind(1)). This allows to use find expressions, even in
extract or list mode, directly on the con&acirc; <br>
tent on an archive. The extensions to find(1) allow to
modify the file metadata.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Star includes a sophisticated
diff command. Several diff options allow user tailorable
functionality. Star won&rsquo;t show you differences you are
not interested in. Check the dif&acirc; <br>
fopts= option for more details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Star has no limitation on
filename length. Pathnames and linknames up to PATH_MAX
(1023 bytes with old OS versions and 4095 bytes with
POSIX.1-2001) may be archived. Later ver&acirc; <br>
sions may be able to deal with longer pathnames.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Star deals with all 3 times,
available for files on UNIX systems if the archive format is
either chosen from the star specific formats or is a format
that uses POSIX.1-2001 <br>
extended headers. This is either done in second resolution
by using a star specific POSIX.1-1988 compatible extension
or in sub second resolution by using POSIX.1-2001 extended
<br>
headers. Star is able to store and restore all 3 times
(mtime, atime and even ctime). On Solaris 2.x systems, star
is able to do backups without changing any of the 3 the
times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If used with the H=ustar option,
or if called as ustar or tar while the H=headertype option
is not used, star is 100% POSIX compliant.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Star&rsquo;s default format (if
called as star) is xstar and is as posix compliant as
possible. Enhancements to the standard that prevent correct
extraction of single files when using <br>
a different tar implementation that is only POSIX.1-1988
compliant may occur, but they only affect single files with
a pathname that is longer than 100+130 chars or when
archiv&acirc; <br>
ing sparse files with the -sparse option in effect. All
other files will extract correctly. See the description for
the H=headertype option below for more information on
ar&acirc; <br>
chive formats and possible archive interchange problems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Star makes it easy to repair
corrupted filesystems. After a fsck -y has been run on the
filesystem, star is able to restore only the missing files
automatically. Use then star <br>
-diff to check for differences (see EXAMPLES for more
information).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Star automatically recognizes
the type of the archive. Star therefore is able to handle
features and properties of different archive types in their
native mode, if it knows <br>
about the peculiarities of the archive type. See the
H=headertype option for more details. To be able to do this,
star adds hidden fingerprints to the archive header that
<br>
allows to recognise all star specific archive formats. The
GNU tar format is recognised by the way it deviates from the
standard.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Star automatically recognizes
and handles byte swapped archives. There is no option to
manually control byte swapping.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Star automatically recognizes
and handles compressed archives inside plain files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Star is able to archive and
restore Access Control Lists for files using POSIX.1-2001
extended headers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMAND <br>
In native mode, star is compatible to the command line
syntax of a typical POSIX command and for this reason
expects commands and options to start with a single dash
(-). In this <br>
case, commands and options may be specified separately, all
boolean or increment type options may be specified either
separately or combined. For compatibility with GNU
pro&acirc; <br>
grams, long options may alternatively start with a double
dash. In compatibility mode to POSIX tar, star expects
commands and options to appear as one single string that
does <br>
not start with a dash. In POSIX tar compatibility mode,
additional non POSIX options may be specified but must
appear after the POSIX options and their args and need to
start <br>
with a dash.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Create a new tarfile and
write named files into it. Writing starts at the beginning
of tarfile. See -v option for information on how to increase
verbosity while the ar&acirc; <br>
chive is written.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-copy Copy named files to the
target directory which is the last file type argument. The
target directory must exist. The shorthand -cx instead of
-copy is not allowed because <br>
this could be a result of a typo.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the option -diff has been
specified in addition, star performs a one pass directory
tree compare instead of copying files. The shorthand -c
-diff instead of -copy <br>
-diff is also allowed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On operating systems with slow
file I/O (such as Linux), it may help to use -no-fsync in
addition, but then star is unable to detect all error
conditions; so use with <br>
care.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the option -t has been
specified in addition, the last file type argument is not a
target directory and star is performing a one pass listing
instead of copying files. <br>
This makes sense as the listing from star may be better
readable than the output from ls -lR. The shorthand -c -t or
-ct instead of -copy -t is also allowed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The job is by default done in
the best archive mode. This implies that it defaults to
H=exustar -dump. When in -copy mode, star forks into two
processes and data <br>
exchange is done via the shared memory from the FIFO. This
gives the best possible performance. Without FIFO, the -copy
mode will not work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The list= option, patterns and
substitutions apply only to the create side of the copy
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-diff Compare the content and
the attributes of the files from the archive in tarfile to
the filesystem. This may also be used to compare two file
trees in the filesystem. If <br>
you use a set of diffopts that fits your needs, it will give
- in many cases - a more readable output than diff -r. If
you use star&rsquo;s dump extensions for the tar archive,
<br>
the -diff option allows to find even if the directory in the
file tree contains more files than the archive. This way, it
is possible to compare all properties of two file <br>
trees in one run. See diffopts for more details. Adding one
or more -v options increases the verbosity. With -vv and
above, the directory content is compared also if <br>
star is reading a tar archive that has been created in -dump
mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n No extraction. Show what star
would do, in case the -x command had been specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Replace files in a tarfile.
The named files are written to the end of tarfile. This
implies that later, the appropriate files will be found more
than once on the <br>
tarfile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Table of contents. List the
contents of the tarfile. If the -v flag is used, the listing
is similar to the format of ls -l output. With this option,
the flags -a, <br>
-atime and -ctime have a different meaning if the archive is
in star, xstar, xustar, exustar, or pax format. The option
-a or -atime lists the access time instead of the <br>
modification time, the option -ctime lists the file creation
time instead of the modification time. The option -tpath may
be used in addition to modify the output so it <br>
may be used in shell scripts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u Update a tarfile. The named
files are written to the end of tarfile if they are not
already there or if the files are newer than the files of
the same name found in the <br>
archive. The -r and -u command only work if the tar archives
is a regular file or if the tar archive is an unblocked tape
that may backspace.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x Extract the named files from
the tarfile. If no filename argument or pattern is
specified, the entire content of the tarfile is restored. If
the -U flag is not used, <br>
star extracts no file which is older than the corresponding
file on disk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On operating systems with slow
file I/O (such as Linux), it may help to use -no-fsync in
addition, but then star is unable to detect all error
conditions; so use with <br>
care.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Except for the shorthands
documented above, exactly one of the commands above must be
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If one or more patterns or
substitution commands have been specified, they apply to any
of the command listed above. In copy mode, all patterns and
substitute commands apply to <br>
the create side.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-help Print a summary of the most important options for
star(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-xhelp Print a summary of the
less important options for star(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-/ Don&rsquo;t strip leading
slashes from file names when extracting an archive. Tar
archives containing absolute pathnames are usually a bad
idea. With other tar implementa&acirc; <br>
tions, they may possibly never be extracted without
clobbering existing files. Star for that reason, by default
strips leading slashes from filenames when in extract <br>
mode. As it may be impossible to create an archive where
leading slashes have been stripped while retaining correct
path names, star does not strip leading slashes in <br>
create mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See SECURITY NOTES for more
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-.. Don&rsquo;t skip files that
contain /../ in the name. Tar archives containing names with
/../ could be used to compromise the system. If they are
unpacked together with a lot of <br>
other files, this would in most cases not even be noticed.
For this reason, star by default does not extract files that
contain /../ in the name if star is not in interac&acirc;
<br>
tive mode (see -w option).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See SECURITY NOTES for more
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-7z run the input or output
through a p7zip pipe - see option -z below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the p7zip program
currently does not operate on a pipe but on a /tmp file copy
and thus limits the maximum archive size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-5</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-6</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-7 Select an archive entry from
/etc/default/star. The format for the archive entries is the
same as the format in /etc/default/tar in Solaris.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-acl Handle Access Control List
(ACL) information in create and extract mode. If -acl has
been specified, star is in create mode and the header type
is exustar, star will add <br>
ACL information to the archive using POSIX.1-2001 extended
headers. If -acl has been specified and star is in extract
mode, star will try to restore ACL information. If <br>
there is no ACL information for one or all files in the
archive, star will clear the ACL information for the
specific file. Note that if -acl has not been specified,
star <br>
will not handle ACL information at all and files may inherit
ACL information from the parent directories. If the -acl
option has been specified, star assumes that the -p <br>
option has been specified too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">artype=headertype <br>
Generate a tape archive in headertype format. If this option
is used in extract/list mode this forces star to interpret
the headers to be of type headertype. As star <br>
even in case of a user selected extract archive format does
format checking, it may be that you will not be able to
unpack a specific archive with all possible forced ar&acirc;
<br>
chive formats. Selecting the old tar format for extraction
will always work though. Valid parameter for headertype
are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">help Print a help message about
possible header types.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">v7tar Old UNIX V7 tar format.
This archive format may only store plain files. Pathnames or
linknames longer than 99 chars may not be archived.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the v7tar format has been
selected, star will not use enhancements to the historic
UNIX V7 tar format. File size is limited to 2 GB - 2 bytes,
uid/gid is <br>
limited to 262143. Sparse files will be filled up with
zeroes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tar Old BSD UNIX tar format.
This archive format may only store plain files, directories
and symbolic links. Pathnames or linknames longer than 99
chars may not be <br>
archived. See also the -d option as a note to some even
older tar implementations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the tar format has been
selected, star will not use enhancements to the historic tar
format. File size is limited to 2 GB - 2 bytes, uid/gid is
limited to <br>
262143. Sparse files will be filled up with zeroes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">star Old star standard format.
This is an upward/downward compatible enhancement of the old
(pre Posix) UNIX tar format. It has been introduced in 1985
and therefore <br>
is not Posix compliant. The star format allows to archive
special files (even sockets) and records access time and
creation time besides the modification time. <br>
Newer versions of the old star format allow very long
filenames (100+155 chars and above), linknames &gt; 100
chars and sparse files (if -sparse is used). This <br>
format is able to copy the device nodes on HP-UX that have
24 bits in the minor device number, which is more then the
21 bits that are possible with the <br>
POSIX-1003.1-1988 archive format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The nonstandard extensions are
located in the space between the link name and the POSIX
file name prefix. As the star format does not use a POSIX
magic string, <br>
the extensions do not interfere with the POSIX tar formats.
The last 4 bytes of the tar header contain a &rsquo;tar
&rsquo; signature.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gnutar This is a commonly used,
but unfortunately not Posix compliant (although designed
after 1987) enhancement to the old tar format. The gnutar
format has been <br>
defined between 1989 and 1994. Do not use the gnutar archive
format unless you want to create an archive for a target
system that is known to have only the gnu&acirc; <br>
tar program available. The gnutar archive format violates
basic rules for any (even the historic) tar archive format,
in special when sparse files are archived <br>
using the -sparse option. Using the gnutar archive format
causes a high risk that the resulting archive may only be
read by gnutar or by star. The implementa&acirc; <br>
tion of the gnutar archive format within star is not
complete, but sufficient for most gnutar archives. See NOTES
for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ustar
IEEE/Posix1003/IEC-9945-1-1988 Standard Data Interchange
format. With this option in effect, star will generate 100%
POSIX.1-1988 compliant tar archives. Files <br>
with pathnames longer than 100+155 chars or linknames longer
than 100 chars may not be archived. If star is called as
ustar the default archive format is ustar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the ustar format has been
selected, star will not use enhancements to the POSIX.1-1988
tar format, the archive will be strictly conforming. File
size is lim&acirc; <br>
ited to 8 GB, uid/gid/major/minor is limited to 2097151.
Sparse files will be filled up with zeroes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pax The
IEEE/Posix1003/IEC-9945-1-1988 successor is the
POSIX-1003.1-2001 Standard Data Interchange format. It is
called the pax archive format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the pax format has been
selected, star will not use enhancements to the POSIX.1-2001
tar format, the archive will be strictly conforming. File
size is unlim&acirc; <br>
ited, uid/gid/uname/gidname is unlimited, major/minor is
limited to 2097151. Sparse files will be filled up with
zeroes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xstar The extended standard tar
format has been introduced in 1994. Star uses the xstar
format as default archive format. This is an upward/downward
compatible <br>
enhancement of the IEEE/Posix1003/IEC-9945-1 Standard Data
Interchange format. It allows among others very long
filenames (100+130 chars and above) and records <br>
access time and creation time. Sparse files will be archived
correctly (if -sparse is used).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The access time and creation
time are stored at the end of the POSIX file name prefix
(this limits the prefix to 130 chars). These extensions do
not interfere <br>
with the POSIX standard as the fields for mtime and ctime
field are always separated from the POSIX file name prefix
by a null byte. The last 4 bytes of the tar <br>
header contain a &rsquo;tar &rsquo; signature.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The xstar format is the default
format when star is neither called as tar nor called as
ustar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xustar A new format introduced
1998, that omits the &rsquo;tar &rsquo; signature at the end
of the tar header. It is otherwise identical to the xstar
format. As some tar imple&acirc; <br>
mentations do not follow the POSIX rules and compute the
checksum for less than 512 bytes of the tar header, this
format may help to avoid problems with these <br>
broken tar implementations. The main other difference to the
xstar format is that the xustar format uses POSIX.1-2001
extended headers to overcome limitations <br>
of the historic tar format while the xstar format uses
proprietary extensions. The xustar format is the default
format when star is called as tar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File size is unlimited,
uid/gid/uname/gidname is unlimited, major/minor is
unlimited. Sparse files will be archived correctly (if
-sparse is used).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">exustar A format similar to the
xustar format but with forced POSIX.1-2001 extended headers.
If this format is used together with the -acl option, star
records Access <br>
Control Lists (ACLs) in POSIX.1-2001 extended headers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The exustar format allows to
archive all file types but it does not archive more than the
POSIX.1-1988 set by default. If the -dump option is used or
if star is <br>
otherwise on dump mode, star archives all file types and in
addition archives more meta data then usual.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File size is unlimited,
uid/gid/uname/gidname is unlimited, major/minor is
unlimited. Sparse files will be archived correctly (if
-sparse is used).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">suntar The extended header
format found on Solaris 7/8/9. This format is similar to the
pax format but does not handle atime and ctime and in
addition uses &rsquo;X&rsquo; as the <br>
typeflag for the extended headers instead of the standard
&rsquo;x&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File size is unlimited,
uid/gid/uname/gidname is unlimited, major/minor is
unlimited. Sparse files will be filled up with zeroes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bin The cpio UNIX V7 binary
format. This is a format with big interoperability problems.
Try to avoid this format. It is only present to make the
scpio command <br>
SVr4 compliant.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cpio The POSIX.1-1988 cpio
format. This format uses octal ascii headers. A similar
format is created by calling cpio -o -c on pre SYSVr4
systems and by calling cpio <br>
-o -Hodc on SYSVr4 systems. The POSIX.1-1988 cpio format
allows a file name length up to 262142 characters and allows
to archive nearly any file type. File <br>
size is limited to 8 GB, uid/gid/st_dev is limited to
262143. The way major and minor device numbers are stored
inside the st_dev field is implementation depen&acirc; <br>
dent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Even though this archive format
is covered by the POSIX.1-1988 standard, it has a lower
portability than the ustar format. Try to avoid the cpio
archive format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">odc This archive format is
similar to the The POSIX.1-1988 cpio format but the file
name length is limited to 255 characters and the socket file
type is not allowed. <br>
This archive format has been introduced to allow non POSIX
cpio implementations such as the cpio program on SYSV to
accept the archive. Use this format whenever <br>
you are not sure if the target system offers a fully POSIX
compliant cpio program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Even though this archive format
is covered by the POSIX.1-1988 standard, it has a lower
portability than the ustar format. Try to avoid the odc
archive format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">asc Tell star to create a cpio
archive in the ascii format that is created with cpio -o -c
on SYSVr4 systems. It uses extended (32 bit) numbers for
uid&rsquo;s, gid&rsquo;s and <br>
device numbers but limits the file size to 4 GB - 2 bytes
although the format has been specified after the
POSIX.1-1988 cpio format. Try to avoid the asc ar&acirc;
<br>
chive format because of its limited portability.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">crc This format is similar to
the asc cpio format but in addition uses a simple byte based
checksum called here as CRC. This algorithm is simple Sum32
-- not a <br>
polynomial CRC. Try to avoid the crc archive format because
of its limited portability.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All tar archive formats may be
interchanged if the archive contains no files that may not
be archived by using the old tar format. Archives in the
xstar format may be <br>
extracted by any 100% POSIX compliant tar implementation if
they contain no files with pathnames &gt; 100+130 chars and
if they contain no sparse files that have been <br>
archived by using the -sparse option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ask_remove <br>
obsoleted by -ask-remove</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ask-remove <br>
Ask to remove non writable files on extraction. By default,
star will not overwrite files that are read only. If this
option is in effect, star will ask whether it <br>
should remove these files to allow the extraction of a file
in the following way:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">remove &rsquo;filename&rsquo; ?
Y(es)/N(o) :</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-atime, -a <br>
Reset access time of files after storing them to tarfile. On
Solaris 2.x, (if invoked by root) star uses the _FIOSATIME
ioctl to do this. This enables star not to trash <br>
the ctime while resetting the atime of the files. If the
-atime option is used in conjunction with the list command,
star lists access time instead of modification time. <br>
(This works only in conjunction with the star, xstar,
xustar, exustar, and with the pax format.) Another option to
retain the access time for the the files that are going <br>
to be archives is to readonly mount a UFS snapshot and to
archive files from the mount point of the UFS snapshot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B Force star to perform
multiple reads (if necessary) to fill a block. This option
exists so that star can work across the Ethernet, since
pipes and sockets return partial <br>
blocks even when more data is coming. If star uses stdin as
archive file, star behaves as if it has been called with the
-B option. For this reason, the option -B in <br>
practice is rarely needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-block-number <br>
Print the archive block number (archive offset / 512) at the
beginning of each line when in verbose mode. This allows to
write backup scripts that archive the offsets for <br>
files and that use</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mt fsr blockno</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">to skip to the tape block number
of interest in a fast way if a single file needs to be
restored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">blocks=#, b=# <br>
Set the blocking factor of the tarfile to # times 512 bytes
(unless a different multiplication factor has been specified
- see bs= option for possible multiplication fac&acirc; <br>
tors). Changing the blocking factor only makes sense when
the archive is located on a real tape device or when the
archive is accessed via the remote tape protocol (see <br>
f= option below). The default is to use a blocking factor of
20 i.e. 10 kBytes. Increasing the blocksize will speed up
the backup. For portability with very old tar <br>
implementations (pre BSD 4.2 or pre AT&amp;T SVR4),
blocksize should not be more than 10 kBytes. For
POSIX.1-1988 compatibility, blocksize should be no more than
10 kBytes. <br>
For POSIX.1-2001 compatibility, blocksize should be no more
than 32 kBytes. Most systems also have a hardware limitation
for the blocksize, 32 kBytes and 63 kBytes are <br>
common limits on many systems. The upper limit in any case
is the size of the buffer RAM in the tape drive. Make a test
if you want to make sure that the target system <br>
will handle the intended blocksize. If you use star for data
exchange via tape, it is a good idea to use a blocksize of
10 kBytes unless you are sure that the reading <br>
system will handle a larger blocksize. If you use star for
backup purposes with recent hardware (e.g. DLT tape drives),
a blocksize of 256 kBytes results in sufficient <br>
speed and seems to be a good choice. Star allows block sizes
up to 2 GByte if the system does not impose a smaller limit.
If you want to determine the blocking factor <br>
when reading an unknown tar archive on tape, specify a
blocking factor that is higher than the supposed blocking
factor of the tape. Star then will determine the blocking
<br>
factor by reading the first record of the tape and print a
message:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">star: Blocksize = # records.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Where # is the blocking factor
in multiples of 512 bytes. The blocks= option and the bs=
option are equivalent methods to specify the tape block
size. The blocks= option <br>
is preferred by people who like to use an option that
behaves similar to the interface of the historic tar(1)
implementations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bs=# Set output block size to #.
You may use the same method as in dd(1) and sdd(1). The
number representing the size is taken in bytes unless
otherwise specified. If a num&acirc; <br>
ber is followed directly by the letter &lsquo;.&rsquo;,
&lsquo;w&rsquo;, &lsquo;b&rsquo;, &lsquo;k&rsquo;,
&lsquo;m&rsquo;, &lsquo;g&rsquo;, &lsquo;t&rsquo;, or
&lsquo;p&rsquo;, the size is multiplied by 1, 2, 512, 1024,
1024*1024, 1024*1024*1024, 1024*1024*1024*1024 <br>
or 1024*1024*1024*1024*1024. If the size consists of numbers
separated by &lsquo;x&rsquo; or &lsquo;*&rsquo;,
multiplication of the two numbers is performed. Thus bs=7x8k
will specify a block&acirc; <br>
size of 56 kBytes. Blocksize must be a multiple of 512
bytes. See also the description of the blocks= option for
more details on blocksizes. The option bs= is preferred <br>
by people who like to use an option that behaves similar to
the interface used by dd(1) and sdd(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-bsdchdir <br>
Switch the behavior of the C= option to BSD style. The
default behavior of star is to stay in a working directory
until a new C= is seen. With BSD tar, the C= option is <br>
only related to the next file type argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-bz run the input or output
through a bzip2 pipe - see option -z -Z and -j below. As the
-bz the -j the -Z and the -z option are non standard, it
makes sense to omit the -bz <br>
the -j the -Z and the -z options inside shell scripts if you
are going to extract a compressed archive that is located
inside a plain file as star will auto detect com&acirc; <br>
pression and choose the right decompression option to
extract.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C=dir</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C dir Perform a chdir(2)
operation to dir before storing or extracting the next
files. In all cases, star will perform the chdir(2)
operation relative to the current working <br>
directory of the shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; In list mode
(with the -t flag), star ignores all -C options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; In create mode
(with the -c, -r and -u flag), star walks through all -C
options and file type arguments. While a BSD derived tar(1)
implementation goes back to the <br>
current working directory after storing one file argument
that immediately follows the -C option, star changes the
directory only if a new -C option follows. To <br>
emulate the behavior of a BSD derived tar(1), add a -C .
option after the file argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; In extract mode
(with the -x, -n and -diff flag), star builds a pattern list
together with corresponding directories from previous C=dir
options and performs a <br>
chdir(2) to the corresponding directory of a matching
pattern. All pat= options that do not follow a C=dir option
are interpreted as if they were preceded by a -C <br>
. option. See EXAMPLES for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">compress-program=name <br>
Set a named compress program. The program must compress in a
pipe when called without parameters and decompress when run
with the -d option in a pipe. This option is <br>
otherwise similar to the -z the -j the -Z and the -bz
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-copydlinks <br>
Try to recursively copy the content of linked directories
instead of creating the link. This is an experimental
feature that may help to unpack archives on DOS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-copyhardlinks <br>
This option allows to copy hardlinked targets rather than
creating the link. It helps to extract tar files on systems
that do not implement hardlinks (e.g. BeOS).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-copylinks <br>
This option allows to copy both, hard- and symlinked targets
rather than creating a link. It helps to extract tar files
on systems that do not implement links (e.g. <br>
OS/2). To extract and copy all symlinks correctly, you may
need to call star twice as star cannot copy files that
appear in the archive later than a symlink pointing to <br>
them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-copysymlinks <br>
This option allows to copy symlinked targets rather than
creating a symbolic link. It helps to extract tar files on
systems that do not implement links (e.g. OS/2). To <br>
extract and copy all symlinks correctly, you may need to
call star twice as star cannot copy files that appear in the
archive later than a symlink pointing to them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-cpio-statistics <br>
Instead of the star flavor of the statistics, print
statistics in cpio flavor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ctime If used with the list
command, this lists ctime rather than mtime if the archive
format is star, xstar, xustar, exustar, or pax.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If star is run as root and if
-ctime is used with the extract command and the same archive
formats, this causes star to try to restore even the ctime
of a file by generat&acirc; <br>
ing time storms. You should not do this when in multi user
mode because this may confuse programs like cron and the
news system. Although star tries to eliminate the <br>
accumulative effects of the time storm, there is a tendency
for the system clock to slow down a bit. The clock typically
lags about one millisecond per extracted file. <br>
Use with care and check the system clock after using this
feature.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If used with the create command
this changes the behavior of the newer= option. Star, in
this case compares the ctime of all files to the mtime of
the stamp file rather <br>
then comparing the mtimes of both files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-cumulative <br>
A shorthand for -dump-cumulative. See -dump-cumulative for
more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D Do not descend directories
when in create mode. Normally, star descends the whole tree
if it encounters a directory in in its file parameters. The
option -D is in effect <br>
by default if the list=file option is used. If you like star
to descend directories found in the list file, use the
-dodesc option (see below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Do not store/create
directories. Old versions of tar such as published with the
seventh edition of UNIX are not able to deal with
directories in tar archives. If a tar <br>
archive is generated without directories this avoids
problems with tar implementations found on SYSVr3 and
earlier. If used during extract, no intermediate missing
direc&acirc; <br>
tories are created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-data-change-warn <br>
If the size of a file changes while the file is being
archived, treat this condition as a warning only that does
not cause a non zero exit code. A warning message is <br>
still written if the condition is not otherwise ignored by
another rule from an errctl= option. The -data-change-warn
option works as if the last error control option was</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">errctl=&quot;WARN|GROW|SHRINK
*&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -e option or an ABORT entry
in a condition set up by errctl= has a higher precedence
than the -data-change-warn option. This option is ignored in
extract or list <br>
mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-debug Print debug messages.
Among other things, this gives debug messages for header
type recognition, tar type properties, EOF recognition,
opening of remote archives and fifo <br>
internals.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">diffopts=optlst <br>
Comma separated list of diffopts. Valid members in optlst
are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">help Print a summary of possible
members of the diffopts list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">! Invert the meaning of the
following string. No comma is needed after the exclamation
mark.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">not Invert the meaning of all
members in the diffopts list i.e. exclude all present
options from an initially complete set compare list. When
using csh(1) you might <br>
have problems to use ! due to its strange parser. This is
why the not alias exists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perm Compare file permissions.
With this option in effect, star compares the low order 12
bits of the st_mode field.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mode Same as perm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">symperm Compare permissions even
in case the target file on the local filesystem is a
symbolic link. By default, star will not compare the
permission of symbolic links <br>
as most systems cannot set the permission of symbolic links.
Star compares symperm only if perm is compared also.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">type Compare file type. Note
that star cannot compare the file type in case of a hard
link.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nlink Compare link count on
hardlinks. This only works if the archive is in exustar
format and contains star&rsquo;s dump extensions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">uid Compare numerical user id of
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gid Compare numerical group id
of file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">uname Compare ASCII version of
user id of file. The user name is mapped via the file
/etc/passwd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gname Compare ASCII version of
group id of file. The group name is mapped via the file
/etc/group.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">id Shorthand for:
uid,gid,uname,gname. Compare all user/group related info of
file. Note that this will always find differences if the
source and target system <br>
use different user or group mappings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">size Compare file size. Note
that star cannot compare the file size in case of a hard
link.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">data Compare content of file. If
star already found that the size of the files differ, it
will not compare the content anymore. If the size of the
files differ, <br>
star will always report different data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cont Same as data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rdev Compare major/minor numbers
for device nodes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hardlink Compare target of
hardlinks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">symlink Compare target of
symlinks. This evaluates the paths returned by the
readlink(2) call.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Two symlinks are considered
equal, it they either have a characterwise identical
link-name, or if they either both use an absolute path name
or both use a rela&acirc; <br>
tive path name and the following is true: Both symlinks
point to the same file that must exist or both pathnames
look similar enough.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sympath Compare the target
pathnames of symlinks. This characterwise compares the
strings returned from the readlink(2) call.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sparse Compare if either both
files are sparse or not. If only one of both files is
sparse, then a difference is flagged. This only works with
if the archive format is <br>
star, xstar, xustar, exustar, or gnutar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">atime Compare access time of
file. This only works with if the archive format is star,
xstar, xustar, exustar, or pax.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mtime Compare modification time
of file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ctime This only works with if
the archive format is star, xstar, xustar, exustar, or
pax.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lmtime Compare the modification
time even in case the target file on the local filesystem is
a symbolic link. By default, star will not compare the
modification time <br>
of symbolic links as most systems cannot set the
modification time of symbolic links. Star compares lmtime
only if mtime is compared also.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">times Shorthand for:
atime,mtime,ctime.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dir Compare the content of
directories. This only works if the archive is in exustar
format and contains star&rsquo;s dump extensions. Together
with increased verbose <br>
level (-vv) this will print a list of files that are only in
the archive and a list of files that are only on the current
filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xtimes Shorthand for:
atime,mtime,ctime,lmtime.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">acl Compare access control
lists. This only works if the archive is in exustar format
and has been created with star&rsquo;s -acl option. You need
to specify the -acl <br>
option in addition when running the diff.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xattr Compare extended file
attributes. This only works if the archive is in exustar
format and has been created with star&rsquo;s -xattr option.
You need to specify the <br>
-xattr option in addition when running the diff.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fflags Compare extended file
flags. This only works if the archive is in exustar format
and has been created with star&rsquo;s -xfflags option. You
need to specify the <br>
-xfflags option in addition when running the diff.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If optlst starts with a ! the
meaning of all members in optlst is inverted as with the not
optlist member. In this case, star starts with a complete
list that includes <br>
atime and lmtime. Reasonable diff options to use when
comparing against a copy of a directory tree are
diffopts=!atime,ctime,lmtime.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If diffopts are not specified,
star compares everything but the access time of the files
and the modification time of symbolic links.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dir-group=group <br>
If star extracts archives as root, this option allows to
control the group id of intermediate directories created by
star.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dir-owner=user <br>
If star extracts archives as root, this option allows to
control the owner of intermediate directories created by</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dirmode <br>
If in create mode (i.e. when storing files to archive), star
stores directories past the corresponding files. This
guarantees that even old tar implementations without a <br>
directory cache will be able to restore the correct times of
directories. The option -dirmode should only be used if the
archive needs to be extracted by an old tar <br>
implementation. If star is used to extract an archive that
has been created with -dirmode the directories will not get
an old time stamp unless the option -U is used while <br>
extracting the archive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dodesc <br>
Force star to descend directories found in a list=file. See
also the -D option above. The -dodesc option only works in
create mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dump Allows to create archives
with the same number of attributes as an archive that has
been created with the level= option but without the
restrictions that apply to a true <br>
dump.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The resultant archive may be
seen as a level-less dump which includes similar attributes
as a level 0 dump but may span more than a single file
system and does not need to <br>
use a -C option. It has been originally introduced to make
it easier to implement a star version that supports true
incremental dumps, but it is kept as it gives addi&acirc;
<br>
tional benefits. Star currently sets the archive type to
exustar and, in addition archives more inode meta data
inside POSIX.1-2001 extended headers. See also level= <br>
option and the section INCREMENTAL BACKUPS for more
information on true incremental dumps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dump-cumulative <br>
instructs star to perform incremental dumps relatively to
the last incremental dump of the same level. Incremental
dumps with a level higher than 0 are normally done
rel&acirc; <br>
atively to the content of a previous dump with lower level.
If incremental dumps and restores are going to be used to
synchronize filesystem content, every successive <br>
incremental dump will increase in size if -dump-cumulative
is not used. See section SYNCHRONIZING FILESYSTEMS for more
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dumpdate=name <br>
Tells star to use the mtime of the time stamp file name
instead of using the start time of star. This is needed when
star is run on file system snapshots. If star would <br>
use the the start time with snapshots, all files that have
been modified between the setup of the snapshot and the
start of star would be missing on the backup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dumpmeta <br>
changes the behavior of star in incremental dump mode. If
-dumpmeta is used and only the inode change time (st_ctime)
of a file has been updated since the last incremen&acirc;
<br>
tal dump, star will archive only the meta data of the file
(e.g. uid, permissions, ...) but not the file content. Using
-dumpmeta will result in smaller incremental <br>
dumps, but files that have been created between two
incrementals and set to an old date in st_mtime (e.g. as a
result from a tar extract) will not be archived with full
<br>
content. Using -dumpmeta thus may result in incomplete
incremental dumps, use with extreme care.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e Exit immediately with exit
status -3 (253) if any unexpected error occurs. The -e
option works as if the last error control option was</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">errctl=&quot;ABORT|ALL|DIFF
*&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This allows to use the errctl=
option together with the -e option and thus to ignore some
error conditions while aborting on all other conditions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">errctl= name</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">errctl= error control spec <br>
Add the content from file name to the error control
definitions or add error control spec to the error control
definitions. More than one error control file and more than
<br>
one error control spec as well as a mixture of both forms is
possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The reason for using error
control is to make star quiet about error conditions that
are known to be irrelevant on the quality of the archive or
restore run or to tell <br>
star to abort on certain error conditions instead of trying
to continue with the archive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A typical reason to use error
control is to suppress warnings about growing log files
while doing a backup on a live file system. Another typical
reason to use error con&acirc; <br>
trol is to tell star to abort if e.g. a file could not be
archived instead of continuing to archive other files from a
list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The error control file contains
a set of lines, each starting with a list of error
conditions to be ignored followed by white space followed by
a file name pattern (see <br>
match(1) or patmatch(3) for more information). The error
control spec uses the same syntax as a single line from the
error control file. If the file name pattern needs <br>
to start with white space, use a backslash to escape the
start of the file name. It is not possible to have new line
characters in the file name pattern. Whenever an <br>
error situation is encountered, star checks the lines in the
error control file starting from the top. If the current
error condition is listed on a line in the error <br>
control file, then star checks whether the pattern on the
rest of the line matches the current file name. If this is
the case, star uses the current error control speci&acirc;
<br>
fication to control the current error condition.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The list of error conditions to
be handled may use one or more (in this case separated by a
&rsquo;|&rsquo; character) identifiers from the list
below:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ABORT If this meta condition is
included in an error condition, star aborts (exits) as soon
as possible after this error condition has been seen instead
of making <br>
star quiet about the condition. This error condition flag
may only be used together with at another error condition or
a list of error conditions (separated <br>
by a &rsquo;|&rsquo; character).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WARN If this meta condition is
included in an error condition, star prints the warning
about the error condition but the error condition does not
affect the exit <br>
code of star and the error statistics (which is printed to
the end) does not include the related errors. This error
condition flag may only be used together <br>
with at another error condition or a list of error
conditions (separated by a &rsquo;|&rsquo; character). The
WARN meta condition has a lower precedence than ABORT.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Be very careful when using error
control as you may ignore any error condition. If you ignore
the wrong error conditions, you may not be able to see real
problems anymore.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-exclude-from name <br>
Exclude from named file, this is an alias for the -X option.
See -X option for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F,-FF ... <br>
Fast and simple exclude option for create mode. With one -F
argument, star ignores all directories called SCCS and RCS.
With two -F arguments, star in addition ignores <br>
all files called core errs a.out all files ending with .o.
OBJ/. With three -F arguments, star ignores all sub trees
starting from a directory that includes a file .mir&acirc;
<br>
ror or .exclude and all object files and files called core
errs a.out all files ending with .o. With four -F arguments,
star ignores all sub trees starting from a direc&acirc; <br>
tory that includes a file .mirror or .exclude the latter
files are excluded too as well as and all object files and
files called core errs a.out all files ending with .o. <br>
With five -F arguments, star in addition again excludes all
directories called SCCS and RCS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fifo Use a fifo to optimize
data flow from/to tarfile. This option is in effect by
default (it may be changed at compile time). The default
fifo size is 8 MBytes on all plat&acirc; <br>
forms except Linux versions that do not support mmap() (4 MB
because kernels before 2.4 did not handle big shared memory
areas) and Sun/mc68000 (1 MB). This will star <br>
make even work on a tiny machine like a Sun 3/50. The fifo
size may be modified with the fs= option. A rule of dumb for
the fifo size is to use more than the buffer size <br>
of the tape drive and less then half of the real memory of
the machine. A good choice would be to use a fifo size
between 8 and 256 MB. This may increase backup speed up <br>
to 5% compared to the speed achieved with the default fifo
size. Note that with a DLT drive that gives 12MB/s transfer
rate, a fifo of 256 MB size will keep the tape at <br>
least streaming in units of 20 seconds. All options that
start with the -f sequence are sensitive to typo problems,
see BUGS section for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fifostats <br>
Print fifo statistics at the end of a star run when the fifo
has been in effect. All options that start with the -f
sequence are sensitive to typo problems, see BUGS sec&acirc;
<br>
tion for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file=tarfilename, f=tarfilename
<br>
Use tarfilename as the name for the tar archive. Currently
up to 100 file= options are possible. Specifying more then
one file= option make sense in multi volume mode. In <br>
this case star will use the next name in the list every time
a media change is needed. To make star behave consistent
with the single file case, star loops over the list <br>
of known archive files. Note that if star is installed suid
root and the first tarfile is a remote archive, only the
connection to this archive will be created with root <br>
privileges. After this connection has been established as
root, star switches back to the id of the caller. If any of
the other archives in the list is located on a dif&acirc;
<br>
ferent host, star will not be able to open this archive
later on, unless run by root.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Star normally uses stdin/stdout
for the tar archive because the most common way to use star
is in conjunction with pipes. If star is installed suid root
or if it has been <br>
called by root, tarfilename may be in remote syntax:
user@host:filename as in rcp(1) even if invoked by non root
users. See SUID NOTES for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To make a file local although it
includes a colon (:), the filename must start with:
&rsquo;/&rsquo;, &rsquo;./&rsquo; or &rsquo;../&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that if star talks to an
old rmt remote tape server that does not support symbolic
open modes, it does not open a remote tape with the O_CREAT
open flag because this <br>
would be extremely dangerous. If the rmt server on the other
side is the rmt server that comes with star or the GNU rmt
server, star may use the symbolic mode for the <br>
open flags. Only the symbolic open modes allow to send all
possible open modes in a portable way to remote tape
servers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is recommended to use the rmt
server that comes with star. It is the only rmt server that
gives platform independent compatibility with BSD, Sun and
GNU rmt clients <br>
and it includes security features that may be set up in
/etc/default/rmt. All options that start with the -f
sequence are sensitive to typo problems, see BUGS section
for <br>
more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See ENVIRONMENT section for
information on how to use ssh(1) to create a remote tape

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that if file=- has been
specified, it is no longer possible to use the -find -exec
primary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-find This option acts a
separator. If it is used, all star options must be to the
left of the -find option. To the right of the -find option,
star accepts the find command <br>
line syntax only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The find expression acts as a
filter between the source of file names and the consumer,
which may either be the archiving engine or list/extract
engine. If the find <br>
expression evaluated as TRUE, then the related file is
selected for processing, otherwise it is omited.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to make the evaluation
of the find expression more convenient, star implements
additional find primaries that have side effects on the file
meta data. Star <br>
implements the following additional find primaries:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-chgrp gname <br>
The primary always evaluates as true; it sets the group of
the file to gname.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-chmod mode <br>
The primary always evaluates as true; it sets the
permissions of the file to mode. Octal and symbolic
permissions are accepted for mode as with chmod(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-chown uname <br>
The primary always evaluates as true; it sets the owner of
the file to uname.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-false The primary always
evaluates as false; it allows to make the result of the full
expression different from the result of a part of the

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-force_hole <br>
obsoleted by -force-hole</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-force-hole <br>
Try to extract all files with holes. This even works with
files that are created without the -sparse option. Star, in
this case examines the content of the files in the <br>
archive and replaces writes to parts containing binary
zeroes with seeks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If used together with the
-sparse option in create mode, star assumes all files to be
sparse and archives files with blocks of nulls as sparse
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option should be used with
extreme care because you sometimes get in trouble when files
get unattended holes. All options that start with the -f
sequence are sensi&acirc; <br>
tive to typo problems, see BUGS section for more
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-force_remove <br>
obsoleted by -force-remove</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-force-remove <br>
Force to remove non writable files on extraction. By
default, star will not overwrite files that are read only.
If this option is in effect, star will silently remove <br>
these files to allow the extraction of a file. All options
that start with the -f sequence are sensitive to typo
problems, see BUGS section for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-force-restore <br>
Force an incremental restore even if the incremental dump is
only a partial dump. See -wtardumps, level= and section
INCREMENTAL BACKUPS for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fs=# Set fifo size to #. See bs=
for the possible syntax. The default size of the fifo is 1
Mbyte on Sun mc68000 systems, 4 Mbytes on non mmap() aware
Linux systems and 8 <br>
Mbytes on all other systems. See -fifo option for hints on
using the right fifo size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fs-name=mount_point <br>
Use mount_point when recording information in /etc/tardumps
and when comparing against information in /etc/tardumps for
incremental backups. This makes sense when backups <br>
are made using file system snapshots and allows
/etc/tardumps and the archive to contain the real name of
the file system instead of the temporary mount point that is
used <br>
for the snapshot device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">H=headertype <br>
See artype=headertype option. Note that POSIX.1-2001 defines
an option -H that follows symbolic links that have been
encountered on the command line. For this reason, <br>
the old star option H=headertype option may go away in the
future even though this option has been in use by cpio since
1989.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, -L Follow symbolic links as
if they were files. Normally star will not follow symbolic
links but stores their values in tarfile. See also the -L
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-hardlinks <br>
In extract mode, this option tells star to try to create a
hardlink whenever a symlink is encountered in the archive.
In create mode, this option tells star to try to ar&acirc;
<br>
chive a hardlink whenever a symlink is encountered in the
file system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-hpdev Allow 24 bits for the
minor device number using 8 octal digits. Note that although
it allows to create tar archives that can be read with HP-UX
tar, this creates tar ar&acirc; <br>
chives which violate POSIX.1-1988. This option is only
needed if you like to use a POSIX.1-1988 based archive
format that does not include extensions. If you use the <br>
xstar format, star will use a base 256 extension that allows
bigger major/minor numbers by default, if you use the xustar
or the exustar format there is no limitation at <br>
all as these formats use POSIX.1-2001 extended headers to
archive the major/minor numbers by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i Ignore checksum errors on tar
headers. If this option is specified, star will not exit if
a header with a bad checksum is found but search for the
next valid header.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-install <br>
Carefully replace existing files when extracting files. This
is done similar to install(1) by first extracting the files
into a temporary name and renaming the file to the <br>
final name after the extraction of that file was
successful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As star by default does not
remove non-empty directories, an install that needs to
remove existing non-empty directories may also need the
options -force-remove and <br>
-remove-recursive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-j run the input or output
through a bzip2 pipe - see option -z -Z and -bz below. As
the -bz the -j the -Z and the -z option are non standard, it
makes sense to omit the -bz <br>
the -j the -Z and the -z options inside shell scripts if you
are going to extract a compressed archive that is located
inside a plain file as star will auto detect com&acirc; <br>
pression and choose the right decompression option to
extract.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-keep-nonempty-dirs <br>
Do not complain about trying to remove nonempty directories
in case that -remove-recursive has not been specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-keep_old_files <br>
obsoleted by -keep-old-files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-keep-old-files, -k <br>
Keep existing files rather than restoring them from tarfile.
This saves files from being clobbered even if tarfile
contains a more recent version of the corresponding <br>
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See SECURITY NOTES for more
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L, -h Follow symbolic links as
if they were files. Normally star will not follow symbolic
links but stores their values in tarfile. See also the -h
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l Do not print a warning
message if not all links to hard linked files could be
dumped. This option is evaluated in the opposite way to
historic tar(1) implementations and <br>
to POSIX.1. POSIX.1 requests that by default no warning
messages will be printed and -l will enable warning messages
when not all links could be archived.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">level=dumplevel <br>
Set level for incremental dumps. This option is used to
switch star into true incremental dump mode. The dumplevel
may be in the range between 0..99.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In true incremental dump mode, a
-C option which is followed by the name a mount point and a
dot (&rsquo;.&rsquo;) as starting directory name is
required. Only a single file system <br>
may be handled at a time. If the directory following the -C
option is not referring to a root directory of a file
system, the dump is called a partial dump. If the <br>
directory following the -C option is referring to a root
directory of a file system and no other restrictions apply
that exclude certain files from the dump, the dump is <br>
called a full dump.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, the tardumps
database is not written. See also the tardumps=name and
-wtardumps options and the section INCREMENTAL BACKUPS for
more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-link-data <br>
In create mode, include the data for files even if these
files are hard links. This feature in create mode is
currently only available for the exustar archive format and
<br>
only in case -sparse has not been specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In extract mode, allow star to
deal with data in hard linked files even if the standard
would not allow this for the used archive format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-link-dirs <br>
When in create mode, try to find hard linked directories.
Using -link-dirs will force star to keep track of all
directories that will go into the archive and thus causes
<br>
a lot more memory to be allocated than in the default
case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you like to extract a cpio
archive that contains hard linked directories, you also need
to specify -link-dirs in extract or diff mode. This is
needed because many cpio <br>
implementations create buggy archives with respect to hard
links. If star would look for hard linked directories in all
cases, it would detect many pseudo hard links to <br>
directories. Use -link-dirs with care if you extract cpio
archives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that not all filesystem
allow to create hard links to directories. Also note that
even though a non-root user is able detect and archive hard
linked directories, all <br>
known operating systems require the extraction to be done as
root in order to be able to create or remove hard links to
directories. For this reason its only recommended <br>
to use this option when doing accurate backups and when hard
links to directories are expected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the option -link-dirs is
not used and hard links to directories are present, the
appendant sub-tree will appear more than once on the archive
and star will print <br>
Linkcount below zero warnings for non directory hard links
inside the sub-tree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list=filename <br>
Read filenames for store/create/list/diff command from
filename. The file filename must contain a list of path
names, each on a separate line. This option implies the -D
<br>
option. To force star to descend directories, use the
-dodesc option in this case. See also the -X option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that if list=- has been
specified, it is no longer possible to use the -find -exec
primary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-lowmem <br>
Try to run with reduced memory requirements. This causes
star to default to 1 MB of FIFO memory. Instead of
allocating memory to hold the directory content and reading
<br>
the directory at once, star reads the directory name by
name. This may cause star to close the directory if it rans
out of file descriptors because of deeply nested
direc&acirc; <br>
tories. If a directory then does not support
telldir(3)/seekdir(3), star will fail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-lzip run the input or output
through a lzip pipe - see option -z below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-lzo run the input or output
through a lzop pipe - see option -z below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M, -xdev <br>
Do not descend mount points. This is useful when doing
backups of complete file systems. See NOTES for more
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m Do not restore access and
modification time. (Access time is only available if star is
reading star, xstar, xustar, exustar, or pax archives). If
star extracts other ar&acirc; <br>
chive types, the -m flag only refers to the modification
time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-match-tree <br>
If in create mode a pattern does not match a directory, and
-match-tree has been specified, the whole directory tree is
excluded from the archive and from further direc&acirc; <br>
tory scans. By default, star excludes the directory but
still recursively scans the content of this directory as
complex patterns could allow files inside the directory <br>
tree to match. Using -match-tree allows to efficiently
exclude whole trees from scanning. This helps to avoid
scannings directory trees that are on remote file systems or
<br>
contain excessive bad blocks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">maxsize=# <br>
Do not store files in tarfile if they are bigger than #. See
bs= for the possible syntax. By default, the number is
multiplied by 1024, so the value counts in units of <br>
kBytes. If the size specifier ends with a valid
multiplication character (e.g &rsquo;.&rsquo; for bytes or
&rsquo;M&rsquo; for MB) the specified size is used as
specified and not multiplied by <br>
1024. See bs= option for all possible multipliers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-meta In create mode, -meta
causes star to archive all meta data of the file (e.g. uid,
permissions, ...) but not the file content. In extract mode,
it causes star to restore <br>
all meta data but not the file content. In addition, in
extract mode no plain file, special file or directory will
be created. Meta files are needed to support incremen&acirc;
<br>
tal backups.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning: Do not try to extract
star archives containing meta files using other tar
implementations if they are not aware of the meta file
extensions of star. Star tries <br>
to force all tar implementations that are not standard
compliant to abort. Star also tries to make all non
POSIX.1-2001 compliant tar implementations unable to find a
<br>
valid filename. However when other POSIX.1-2001 aware tar
implementations come up and don&rsquo;t know about meta
files, they will destroy files on disk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The problems result from the
only current fallback in the POSIX standard that tells tar
implementations to treat all unknown file types as if they
were plain files. As <br>
meta files are needed for incremental backups, I am looking
for people and companies who like to support me to be able
to add the meta file concept to the POSIX.1-2005 <br>
standard.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-modebits <br>
This options allows you to create tar archives that include
more than 12 bits from st_mode. Note this create tar
archives that violate POSIX but some tar implementations
<br>
insist in reading such nonstandard archives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-multivol <br>
Switch to multi volume mode. In multi volume mode, there
will be no logical EOF marker written to the end of a single
tape. If -multivol is used in read mode, a hard EOF <br>
on input (if not preceded by a logical EOF) triggers a
medium change operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specifying -multivol tells star
to split files across volumes if needed. This way, a virtual
archive is created that spans more than one medium. Multi
volume mode is <br>
needed whenever it is not possible to split the archiving or
extracting into several logically independent tasks. This is
true for e.g. incremental dump/restore operations <br>
where inode numbers need to be traced for the whole
task.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When tsize=# has been specified,
but star is not in multi volume mode, files cannot be split
across volumes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When -multivol has been
specified in create mode together with tsize=# then a media
change is initiated exactly after an amount of tsize data
has been written. When -mul&acirc; <br>
tivol has been specified in create mode and tsize=# has not
been specified, then the medium change is triggered by a EOT
condition from writing the medium. This allows to <br>
use media where the size cannot be known in advance (e.g.
tapes with build in compression); it does not work if the
EOT condition is not returned in sync with the related <br>
write operation. For this reason, it is expected that data
buffering inside a device driver cannot be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Depending on the selected
archive format, star writes a volume header at the beginning
of a new medium. This medium header allows to verify the
correct volume after a <br>
change during read back. It is recommended to use the
exustar format for best results. In create mode, -multivol
is only supported for archives types that allow to write
<br>
reliable multi volume header information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See tsize=# option for more
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that -multivol is an
interactive option that prevents star from being used in
non-interactive environments. If you like to use it in a
non-interactive environment, <br>
you need to specify new-volume-script=script in addition in
order to automate the media change procedure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">newer=filename <br>
Do not store files to tarfile if their modification time is
not newer than the modification time of filename. See -ctime
option for changing this behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-newest <br>
In conjunction with the list command this lists you only the
newest file in tarfile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-newest_file <br>
obsoleted by -newest-file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-newest-file <br>
In conjunction with the list command this lists you only the
newest regular file in tarfile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">new-volume-script=script <br>
Call script at end of each tape if in multi volume mode. If
this option is not in effect, star will ask the user to
confirm the volume change. The script is called with <br>
two parameters. The first parameter is the next volume
number and the second parameter is the next archive file
name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nodump <br>
If this option is set, star will not dump files that have
the nodump flag set. Note that this currently only works on
BSD-4.4 derivates and on Linux. On Linux, using this <br>
option will cause a performance degradation (the system time
increases by 10%) because of the unlucky kernel
interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-no-dirslash <br>
Do not add a slash to the end of directory names if writing
to an archive. Historic tar archive formats did only allow
to specify plain files and hard links. Around <br>
1980, BSD added a feature to specify a directory on tape by
adding a slash to the end of the name. POSIX.1-1988 defined
the first official tar archive format that had a <br>
clean method to specify the type of a directory. As old tar
formats need the slash to recognize a directory,
-no-dirslash may not be used if archives should be
compatible <br>
with the old tar format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-no_fifo <br>
obsoleted by -no-fifo</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-no-fifo <br>
Don&rsquo;t use a fifo to optimize data flow from/to
tarfile. Currently the -fifo option is used as default.
(This may be changed at compile time.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-no-fsync <br>
Do not call fsync(2) for each file that has been extracted
from the archive. Using -no-fsync may speed up extraction on
operating systems with slow file I/O (such as <br>
Linux), but includes the risk that star may not be able to
detect extraction problems that occur after the call to
close(2). A typical cause for such problems is a NFS <br>
file system that fills up before the buffer cache is synced
or a write error that occurs while the buffer cache is
synced. There may be other reasons. Use with extreme <br>
care.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nochown, -o <br>
Do not restore owner and group of files. This may be used if
super user privileges are needed to overwrite existing files
but the local ownership of the existing files <br>
should not change.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-no-p Do not restore files and
directories to their original permissions. This option is
needed only if star is called by the super user and the
permissions should not be <br>
restored from the archive. See also the -p option. The -p
options has a higher precedence than the -no-p option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-no_statistics <br>
obsoleted by -no-statistics</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-no-statistics <br>
Do not print statistic messages at the end of a star
run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-no-xheader <br>
Do not create or extract POSIX.1-2001 extended headers. This
option may be used if you like to read an archive with
broken extended headers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-not, -V <br>
Invert the meaning of the pattern list. i.e. use those files
which do not match any of the pattern. Note that this option
only applies to patterns that have been speci&acirc; <br>
fied via the pattern=pattern or pat=pattern option. Patterns
specified as file type arguments will not be affected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-notarg, -pax-c <br>
Match all file or archive members except those specified by
the pattern or file operands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nowarn <br>
Do not print warning messages. This sometimes is useful to
make the output more readable (e.g. when hundreds of files
that are going to be extracted are not newer in the <br>
archive then on the filesystem).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-numeric <br>
Use the numeric user/group fields in the listing rather than
the default. The default allows to list the ASCII version of
user/group of the file and to extract the owners <br>
of the files based on numeric values rather than the names.
In create mode, no user/groups names are put on the archive.
The -numeric option also applies when ACLs are <br>
going to be archived or extracted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O Be compatible to old versions
of tar. If star is invoked with this option, star generates
archives which are fully compatible with old UNIX tar
archives. If in extract <br>
mode, star ignores any additional info in the headers. This
implies neither that archives generated with this option are
binary equal with archives generated by old tar <br>
versions nor that star is trying to comprehend all bugs that
are found in old tar versions. The bug in old tar versions
that cause a reversal of a space and a NULL byte <br>
in the checksum field is not repeated. If you want to have
signed checksums you have to specify the -signed-checksum
option too. If you want directories not to be <br>
archived in order to be compatible to very old historic tar
archives, you need to specify the -d option too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is superseeded by
the H=headertype option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o, -nochown <br>
Do not restore owner and group of files. This may be used if
super user privileges are needed to overwrite existing files
but the local ownership of the existing files <br>
should not change.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-onull, -nullout <br>
Do not actually write to the archive but compute and add the
sizes. This is useful when trying to figure out if a tape
may hold the current backup. Please only use the <br>
-onull option as it is a similar option as used by the
sdd(1) command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P Allow star to write a partial
record as the last record. Normally, star writes each record
with the same size. This option is useful on unblocked tapes
i.e. cartridge <br>
tapes like QIC tapes as well as with archives that are
located in files. If you use this option on local files, the
size of the archive will be smaller. If you use this <br>
option on cartridge tapes, is makes sure that later - in
extract mode - star will read up to the end of file marker
on the tape and the next call to star will read from <br>
the next archive on the same tape.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p Restore files and directories
to their original permissions. Without this option, they are
created using the permissions in the archive and the present
umask(2). If star <br>
is called by the super user, star behaves as if it has been
called with the -p option. See also -no-p option. If the
archive contains Access Control Lists (ACLs) in <br>
POSIX.1-2001 extended headers, star will restore the access
control lists from the archive for files if the -acl option
is specified. If the option -acl has not been <br>
specified, ACLs are not restored at all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pattern=pattern, pat=pattern
<br>
Set matching pattern to pattern. A maximum of 100
pattern=pat options may be specified. As each pattern is
unlimited in length, this is no real limitation. If more
than <br>
one pattern is specified, a file matches if any of the
specified pattern matches. Patterns may be used in create
mode to select or exclude files from the list of file <br>
type arguments or the files located in a sub tree of a file
type argument directory. By default, star scans the whole
directory tree underneath a directory that is in the <br>
argument list. This may be modified by using the -match-tree
option. In extract or list mode, all file type arguments are
interpreted to be select pattern and all option <br>
type patterns may be either select or exclude patterns
depending on the presence or absence of the -not option. If
you use file type select patterns, they work exactly <br>
like the method used by other (non pattern aware) tar(1)
implementations. File type select patterns do not offer
pattern matching but allow to restore subtrees. To <br>
extract a complete sub tree from the directory dir with star
using the pattern= option, use pattern= dir/if you like to
select a subtree by using the historic method, <br>
use dir as file type argument. If you only like to extract
the directory itself, use dir/ as file type argument. See
manual page for match(1) for more details of the <br>
pattern matcher. All patterns are selection patterns by
default. To make them exclude patterns, use the -not or the
-V option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pkglist=file <br>
This is (for now) an internal interface for the Schily
Source Package System (sps). It only works in create mode
and behaves similar to the list= option, but it allows to
<br>
overwrite the permissions, the uid and gid values from the
content of the pkglist= file. Each line from the pkglist=
file contains a file name followed by the permission, <br>
a user name and a group name. The permission is an octal
character string. Each value that is not used to overwrite
the original values may be replaced by a &rsquo;?&rsquo;.
The <br>
fields are separated by spaces, so the pkglist= option does
not allow files that contain newline or space
characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pax-c, -notarg <br>
Match all file or archive members except those specified by
the pattern or file operands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pax-H Follow symbolic links
that have been encountered on the command line. If the
referenced file does not exist, the file information and
type will be for the link itself. <br>
If the link is referencing a file type that cannot be
archived with the current archive format, the file
information and type will be for the link itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pax-i Do interactive renaming
in a way that has been defined for POSIX pax. Star will
print the original filename and prompt for a reply. If you
type just RETURN, than the <br>
file is skipped. If you type &rsquo;.&rsquo;, then the
original file name is retained. If you type anything else,
then this is taken as the new file name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that -pax-i is an
interactive option that prevents star from being used in
non-interactive environments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pax-L Follow symbolic links. If
the referenced file does not exist, the file information and
type will be for the link itself. If the link is referencing
a file type that can&acirc; <br>
not be archived with the current archive format, the file

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pax-ls <br>
Switch listing format to the format defined for POSIX pax
and ls.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pax-match <br>
Allow file type arguments to be recognised as regular
expressions in a way that has been defined for POSIX
pax.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pax-n Allow each pattern to
match only once. If a pattern matches a directors, then the
whole sub tree matches the pattern.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pax-p string <br>
PAX style privileges string. Several characters (each has
its own meaning). The following characters are defined:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a Do not preserve file access
times. This option is currently ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">e Preserve the user ID, group
ID, file mode bits. This is equivalent to calling star -p

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-prinodes <br>
Print inode numbers in verbose list mode if the archive
contains inode numbers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-print-artype <br>
Check the type of the archive, print the archive and

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-refresh_old_files <br>
obsoleted by -refresh-old-files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-refresh-old-files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-refresh <br>
Do not create new files. Only already existing files may be
overwritten from tarfile if either newer versions are
present in the archive or if the -U flag is used. This <br>
allows to overwrite files by more recent files from an
archive that contains more files than the target directory
should contain. The option -refresh-old-files is the <br>
same as the -refresh option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-remove_first <br>
obsoleted by -remove-first</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-remove-first <br>
Remove files before extraction. If this option is in effect,
star will remove files before extracting a file from the
archive. This is needed if you want to change the <br>
file type or if you need to break a hard link. If you do not
use either -ask-remove or -force-remove together with
-remove-first, this option is useless and no files will <br>
be removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-remove_recursive <br>
obsoleted by -remove-recursive</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-remove-recursive <br>
Remove files recursive. If removing of a file is permitted,
star will only remove files, specials and empty directories.
If this option is in effect, star will be <br>
allowed to recursively removes non empty directories
too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-restore <br>
switches star into true incremental restore mode. A file
named star-symtable and a directory named star-tmpdir is
created in the root directory of the file system where <br>
the extraction takes place. If -restore has been specified,
star behaves as if -xdot has been specified too. See also
level= option and section INCREMENTAL BACKUPS for <br>
more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: Do not use the -restore
option if you only like to restore a single file or a list
of selected files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S Do not store/create special
files. A special files is any file except plain files,
symbolic links and directories. You need to be super user to
extract special files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s replstr <br>
Modify file or archive member names named by a pattern
according to the substitution expression replstr. The format
of replstr is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s /old/new/[gp]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The old pattern may use regular
expressions and the new string may contain the special
character &rsquo;&amp;&rsquo;. The character
&rsquo;&amp;&rsquo; is substituted by the string that
matches the old <br>
pattern. The optional trailing &rsquo;g&rsquo; means global
substitution. If &rsquo;g&rsquo; is not used, a substitution
pattern is only used once on a name. If the optional
trailing &rsquo;p&rsquo; is <br>
used, the substitution is printed to standard error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Up to 100 substitute options may
be used. If more than one substitute option has been
specified, star will loop over all substitute patterns until
one matches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the name substitutes to the
empty string, the file is skipped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-secure-links <br>
Do not extract hard links or symbolic links if the link name
(the target of the link) starts with a slash (/) or if /../
is contained in the link name. Tar archives con&acirc; <br>
taining such links could be used to compromise the system.
If they are unpacked together with a lot of other files,
this may not even be noticed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As the usability of a tar
archiver would be limited if -secure-links checking would be
done by default, star makes link checking optional.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you unpacked a tar archive
using the -secure-links and did not get a security warning
at the end of the star run, all files and links have been
extracted. If you get a <br>
warning, you should unpack the archive a second time and
specify the options -k, -w and -nowarn in addition to the
options used for the first run. See SECURITY NOTES for <br>
more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-shm Use System V shared memory
for fifo. Normally star is compiled to use mapped /dev/zero
pages for the fifo, if the operating system supports this.
If star is compiled to <br>
have both code for mapped pages and for System V shared
memory, star will use shared memory instead of the default.
If the -help menu doesn&rsquo;t show the -shm flag you have
<br>
no choice. When using System V shared memory, you may have
to raise the system&rsquo;s internal limit for shared memory
resources to get enough shared memory for star.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-signed_checksum <br>
obsoleted by -signed-checksum</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-signed-checksum <br>
Use signed chars to calculate checksums. This violates the
tar specs but old versions of tar derived from the seventh
edition of UNIX are implemented in this way. Note: <br>
Only filenames and linknames containing chars with the most
significant bit set may trigger this problem because all
other fields only contain 7 bit ASCII characters, <br>
octal digits or binary zeroes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-silent <br>
Suppress informational messages like foobar is sparse.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sparse <br>
Handle files with holes effectively on store/create. Note
that sparse files may not be archived this way if the
archive format is tar, ustar, suntar, pax, or any cpio <br>
variant. On Solaris-2.3 ... Solaris-2.5.1 there is a special
ioctl() called _FIOAI that allows root to get the allocation
info more efficiently. On Solaris 11 there is <br>
an enhanced lseek(2) call with addidional whence values
SEEK_HOLE and SEEK_DATA that allow to find holes in an
efficient way. Other operating systems lack support to get
<br>
the real allocation list and force star to scan the files to
look for blocks that only contain null characters. This may
star cause to assume more holes to be present <br>
than the number that the file really contains.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-symlinks <br>
This option tells star in extract mode to try to create a
symlink whenever a hardlink is encountered in the
archive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T If the option file= or f= is
omitted and the -T option is present, star will use the
device indicated by the TAPE environment variable, if
set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tardumps=name <br>
Set the file name for tar dump dates database to name. The
default name is /etc/tardumps. Use in combination with the
level= option to create true incremental dumps. <br>
See also -wtardumps option and section INCREMENTAL BACKUPS
for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-time Print timing info. See
DIAGNOSTICS for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-to_stdout <br>
obsoleted by -to-stdout</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-to-stdout <br>
Extract files to stdout. This option may be used to extract
tarfiles containing tarfiles (see examples below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-tpath Use this option together
with the -t option or with -cv (verbose create) to get only
a list of the pathnames of the files in the archive. This
may be used in shell <br>
scripts to generate a name list. If used together with the
-diff option, star will only print the names of the files
that differ. A second run of star may then be used <br>
to restore all files that had differences to the archive.
Use the list= option to specify the namelist in this
case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tsize=# <br>
Set tape volume size to # to enable multi volume tape
support. The value refers to the archive size without
compression. See bs= for the possible syntax. By default,
<br>
the number is multiplied by 512, so the value counts in
units of 512 byte blocks. If the size specifier ends with a
valid multiplication character (e.g &rsquo;.&rsquo; for
bytes or <br>
&rsquo;M&rsquo; for MB) the specified size is used as
specified and not multiplied by 512. With this option in
effect, star is able to archive filesystems that are bigger
then the <br>
tape size. If the option tsize=# without -multivol then no
file will be split across volumes and each volume may in
theory be read back separately. Files that do not fit <br>
on a single tape may not be stored in this mode. If
-multivol has been specified in addition, star will split
files when the maximum allowed tape size has been reached.
<br>
If the tape volume size is not a multiple of the tape block
size, the tape volume size is silently rounded down to a
value that is a multiple of the tape block size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See -multivol option for more
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U Restore files
unconditionally. By default, an older file from the archive
will not replace a corresponding newer file on disk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">umask=mask <br>
Set star&rsquo;s umask to mask. This allows to control the
permissions for intermediate directories that are created by
star in extract mode. See also -p option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Increment verbose level by
one. This normally results in more output during operation.
See also in the description for the -t flag. Normally, star
does its work <br>
silently. If the verbose level is 2 or more and star is in
create or update mode, star will produce a listing to the
format of the ls -l output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, -not <br>
Invert the meaning of the pattern list. i.e. use those files
which do not match any of the pattern. Note that this option
only applies to patterns that have been speci&acirc; <br>
fied via the pattern=pattern or pat=pattern option. Patterns
specified as file type arguments will not be affected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-version <br>
Print version information and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VOLHDR=name <br>
Use name to generate a volume header.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w Do interactive creation,
extraction or renaming. For every file that matches the list
of patterns and that has a more recent modification time in
the tar archive (if in <br>
extract mode and the -U option is not specified) star prints
its name and asks:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">get/put ? Y(es)/N(o)/C(hange
name) :</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may answer either
&lsquo;N&rsquo; for No or &lt;Return&gt; to skip this file.
If you answer &lsquo;Y&rsquo; the file is extracted or
archived on tape with its original name. If you answer
&lsquo;C&rsquo;, <br>
you are prompted for a new name. This name is used for the
filename on disk if star is in extract mode or for the
archive name if star is in create mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See SECURITY NOTES for more
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that -w is an interactive
option that prevents star from being used in non-interactive
environments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-wready <br>
This option tells Star to wait up to two minutes for the
drive to become ready. It has been added as a hack for a bug
in the SunOS/Solaris st device driver. This driver <br>
has problems to sense the loading time with Exabyte drives
with factory settings. It also makes sense to use -wready if
multiple remote backups are made. In this case, <br>
the remote connection is closed while the remote tape server
is still writing a file mark. If another remote backup is
initiated before the old remote server did finish <br>
to write the file mark, it would be impossible to open the
tape driver unless -wready is specified to tell star to wait
for the drive to become ready again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-wtardumps <br>
Tell star to update the file that contains the tar dump
dates data base if in dump mode. If the dump is not a full
dump, the tar dump dates data base file is not written. <br>
See also tardumps=name and -C option or INCREMENTAL BACKUPS
section for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X filename <br>
Use the file filename as a file containing a list of path
names to be excluded from the store/create/list/diff
operation. The file filename must contain a list of path
<br>
names, each on a separate line. Be careful with white space
and note that path names in the list may not contain new
lines. Multiple -X options may be used. Each argu&acirc;
<br>
ment must refer to a file containing path names. The -X
option has precedence before other options that select files
to be included in the operation. See also list= <br>
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-xattr</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-xattr-linux <br>
Store and extract extended file attributes as found on Linux
systems. This option only makes sense when creating or
extracting exustar archives as it is based on <br>
POSIX.1-2001 extended tar headers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The method used in the current
implementation could be used to store and extract extended
file attributes from BSD too. Note that the current
implementation is not <br>
generic enough to cover more general extended file attribute
implementations as found on Solaris. If star starts to
implement a method that covers extended file <br>
attributes on Solaris, the new method will be used then
-xattr has been specified and -xattr-linux will refer to the
old method. The method used with -xattr-linux may go <br>
away in the future.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xdebug=#, xd=# <br>
Set extended debug level to #.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-xdev, -M <br>
Do not descend mount points. This is useful when doing
backups of complete file systems. See NOTES for more
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-xdir Extract directories even
if the corresponding directories on the archive are not
newer. This is useful when for some reason, the directories
are recorded after their con&acirc; <br>
tent (see -dirmode option), or when the permissions of some
directories must be set in any case. As the classical UNIX
cpio program does not implement delayed directory <br>
permission and time stamp setting, cpio users often create
archives in reverse order (directories past their content).
For this reason, it makes sense to use -xdir while <br>
extracting cpio archives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-xdot Unconditionally extract
the first directory in the archive if the name of this
directory is either &rsquo;.&rsquo; or &rsquo;./&rsquo;.
This helps to extract archives in an expected way if the
<br>
target directory is a newly created empty directory. As this
directory is newer than the top level directory in the
archive, star would usually skip this directory during <br>
extraction. The effect of this directory is as if -xdir has
been specified but is switched off after the first directory
has been found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-xfflags <br>
Store and extract extended file flags as found on BSD and
Linux systems. This option only makes sense when creating or
extracting exustar archives as it is based on <br>
POSIX.1-2001 extended tar headers. See NOTES section for
problems with -xfflags on Linux systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-xmeta Extract meta files as if
they were files. Meta files in archives are plain files that
do not contain any content data in the archive. They may be
created by using the <br>
-meta option in star&rsquo;s create mode. Existing files are
not overwritten. If a file is missing, a zero sized file is
created. If the option -meta is used together with the <br>
option -force-hole, missing plain files are created as
sparse empty files of the original size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-xz run the input or output
through a xz pipe - see option -z below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Z run the input or output
through a compress pipe - see option -z below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z run the input or output
through a gzip pipe. This is currently a quick and dirty
hack, that mainly will cover the most common usage to
compress the tar output if it is a <br>
file. No reblocking will be done, so this option will
currently only make sense on plain files. As the -bz the -j
the -Z and the -z option are non standard, it makes <br>
sense to omit the -bz the -j the -Z and the -z options
inside shell scripts if you are going to extract a
compressed archive that is located inside a plain file as
star <br>
will auto detect compression and choose the right
decompression option to extract. The environment variable
STAR_COMPRESS_FLAG may be used to specify one option for
gzip. <br>
If you want to write write compressed archives to tape, you
should use <br>
star -c . | gzip | sdd ibs=4k obs=32k -fill of=/dev/rmt/1bn
<br>
or <br>
star -c . | gzip | sdd ibs=4k obs=32k -fill ovsize=60m
of=/dev/rmt/1bn <br>
if the tape can hold 60 MB.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INCREMENTAL BACKUPS <br>
Star is able to back up file system in full and incremental
mode. To allow incremental backups, the file system must
implement POSIX semantics.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To be more verbose:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The filesystem
needs to uniquely identify files by the two numbers st_dev
(The device ID of the device containing the file) and st_ino
(The file serial number). If a file <br>
is renamed, these numbers need to be retained. Both numbers
need to be a cardinal scalar that is expressible in a
decimal number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The filesystem
needs to implement at least two time stamps, st_mtime the
file&rsquo;s last modification time and st_ctime the
file&rsquo;s last status change time. Both time stamps <br>
need to be dealt with as documented by the POSIX standard.
Both numbers need to be a cardinal scalar that is
expressible in a decimal number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The filesystem
needs to allow to rename files and directories by either
calling rename(2), or link(2) and unlink(2).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The filesystem
needs to honor and preserve the case of file names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The incremental backup method
used by star depends on comparing the time stamps of all
files against the time of the last backup. Note that this
method only works correctly if <br>
the level 0 backup and all higher level incrementals include
the whole file system. As star archives all inode meta data,
star is able to detect renamed files by comparing the <br>
inode numbers of all files while in incremental restore
mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Detecting renamed files only
works if star, while in backup mode, scans the whole file
system tree for each full and incremental backup. This will
work in case no files are <br>
excluded and the dump starts at the root directory of a file
system. In case that no files are renamed from excluded
parts to included parts, partial backups may be taken also.
<br>
Partial backups only make sense if a complete directory sub
tree is excluded (e.g. by using the pat= option) or if a
partial backup starts at a sub directory that is not the
root <br>
directory of the file system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To create a level 0 dump
call:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">star -c -xdev -sparse -acl
-link-dirs level=0 -wtardumps f=archive-name -C
/filestem-mount-point .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To create a level 1 dump
call:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">star -c -xdev -sparse -acl
-link-dirs level=1 -wtardumps f=archive-name -C
/filestem-mount-point .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Do not forget the dot at the end
of the command line that specifies the directory to start
the operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Backups from live filesystems
should be avoided. On operating systems that support file
system snapshots, backups should be made from a read-only
mount of a snapshot. Be careful <br>
that all files that have been created between setting up a
snapshot and starting an incremental backup may be missing
from all backups unless the dumpdate=name option is
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the system that is going to
be backed up is not acting as a file server, it makes sense
to shut down all services that may result in inconsistent
file states before setting up <br>
the filesystem snapshot. After the filesystem snapshot has
been set up, the services may be restarted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the the system that is going
to be backed up is acting as a file server, it may be that
services on remote clients cause inconsistent file states
unless all such services that <br>
remotely access files are shut down before the snapshot is
set up.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Star includes options that help
to deal with file system snapshots. The following example
backs up a file system on Solaris using a file system
snapshot:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">echo &gt; /tmp/snapstamp</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mount -r &lsquo;fssnap -F ufs -o
backing-store=/var/tmp/EXPORT-NFS.snap /export/nfs&lsquo;
/mnt</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">star -c -xdev -sparse -acl
-link-dirs level=0 -wtardumps f=archive-name
dumpdate=/tmp/snapstamp fs-name=/export/nfs -C /mnt .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">First a file with a current time
stamp is created, then a snapshot for /export/nfs is created
and mounted on /mnt. The following star command then creates
a level 0 backup from <br>
the file system using the time the snapshot was created and
the original mount point of the file system for
/etc/tardumps and the archive header.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that if the backup is done
on a live file system, it may be unreliable. A typical
problem problem in this context is caused by growing log
files. As growing files are not a <br>
real problem with backups, the best way of dealing with
growing files is to set up a star error control file (see
errctl= option) and to tell star to ignore growing
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BACKUP SCHEDULES <br>
Full (level 0) dumps should be made on a regular base (e.g.
once a month). As a full dump may take a long time and takes
a lot of tape, it is wise to make higher level
incremen&acirc; <br>
tal dumps with shorter intervals. The next table shows a
dump level list that may be used if monthly full dumps take
place:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sun Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri <br>
Week 1: 0 10 10 10 10 5 <br>
Week 2: 10 10 10 10 10 5 <br>
Week 3: 10 10 10 10 10 5 <br>
Week 4: 10 10 10 10 10 5</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The level 10 dumps made between
Monday and Friday accumulate all changes made within the
week. If you don&rsquo;t like this, use the following backup
schedule:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sun Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri <br>
Week 1: 0 20 30 40 50 5 <br>
Week 2: 10 20 30 40 50 5 <br>
Week 3: 10 20 30 40 50 5 <br>
Week 4: 10 20 30 40 50 5</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that in this case, 7 dumps
need to be restored if the a crash happens at the worst case
date (just before the Friday dump in week 2 or later).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INCREMENTAL RESTORES <br>
Incremental restores should be made to an empty file system
(except for the lost+found directory). Star is currently
unable to perform incremental restores to a file system that
<br>
contains active mount points.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The incremental restore
procedure starts with restoring the last full (level 0)
dump. Then the latest incremental dump of each dump level
(with ascending order of dump levels) <br>
need to be restored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Let us assume the first example
from the section BACKUP SCHEDULES for the backup schedule.
If a disk crash happens before the Thursday dump of week 3
has been made, the following <br>
restore procedure needs to be applied:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">level 0 <br>
starting with an empty disk, the full (level 0) dump from
week 1 is restored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">level 5 <br>
after the level 0 restore has been finished, the level 5
dump from Friday in week 2 is restored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">level 10 <br>
after the level 5 restore has been finished, the level 10
dump from Wednesday in week 3 is restored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The disk now contains the same
files as it did when the level 10 dump has been made on
Wednesday of week 3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To extract a level 0 dump
call:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cd /filestem-mount-point <br>
star -xpU -restore f=archive-name</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This creates the directory
star-tmpdir and the database star-symtable in the root
directory of the new file system. Subsequent restores with
higher level backups depend on these <br>
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To extract a level 1 (or higher)
dump call:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cd /filestem-mount-point <br>
star -xpU -restore f=archive-name</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the environment
variable STAR_DEBUG exists, star does not remove files with
link count 1 that have been removed between incremental
dumps. These files are moved to the <br>
directory star-tmpdir. Before you start to extract the next
incremental, you need to remove all files in
star-tmpdir.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNCHRONIZING FILESYSTEMS <br>
Star may be used to synchronize filesystem content. To do
this, an initial copy of the current content of the source
filesystem needs to be performed first.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To create an initial copy of a
filesystem call:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">star -c -xdev -sparse -acl
-link-dirs level=0 -wtardumps -C /filestem-mount-point . |
star -xpU -restore -C /extract-target-dir</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to perform subsequent
synchronization of the target filesystem with the content of
the source filesystem, a modified incremental dump/restore
procedure may be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To copy incremental content of a
filesystem call:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">star -c -xdev -sparse -acl
-link-dirs level=1 -wtardumps -cumulative -C
/filestem-mount-point . | star -xpU -restore -C
/extract-target-dir</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that like with backups in
general, copies from a live filesystem should be avoided. On
operating systems that support file system snapshots, copies
should be made from a <br>
read-only mount of a snapshot. Be careful that all files
that have been created between setting up a snapshot and
starting an incremental copy may be missing from all copies
<br>
unless the dumpdate=name option is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See section INCREMENTAL BACKUPS
to learn how to modify the command line in case file system
snapshots are used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGNALS <br>
If star handles a signal, it first prints the statistics.
Star handles the following signals:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGINT usually generated by ^C
from the controlling tty. Upon receipt of a SIGINT, star
prints statistics and exits. If in create mode i.e. storing
files to archive, star <br>
finishes with the current file to ensure that no partial
file is written to the archive, write an eof record and then
exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGHUP not to be generated from
a tty. The actions are the same as upon receipt of a
SIGINT.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGQUIT usually generated by
^&nbsp;from the controlling tty. Upon receipt of a SIGQUIT,
star prints statistics and continues with the current
operation. This is useful to watch <br>
the progress of the current operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The following exit values are returned:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 All files were processed
successfully.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-3 / 253 <br>
Star has been called with the option -e, or the errctl=
option has been used to mark the current error fatal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-2 / 254 <br>
One or more files could not be processed successfully.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-1 / 255 <br>
Command line parsing error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt;0 Other positive exit codes:
The errno of the call that caused the fatal error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
To get a listing in a way similar to ls -l one might
use:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">example% star -tv
f=/dev/rmt/1bn</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The same command as listed above
in a POSIX tar command line syntax compliant way is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">example% star tvf
/dev/rmt/1mbn</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To copy the directory tree in
/home/someuser to the directory /home/fs use:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">example% (cd /home/someuser;
star -c .) | (cd /home/fs ; star -xp)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or by using the change directory
option of star:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">example% star -c -C
/home/someuser . | star -xp -C /home/fs</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that both examples above
are not the optimum way to copy a directory tree. A more
efficient way to copy a directory tree is to use the -copy
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">example% star -copy -p -xdot -C
/home/someuser . /home/fs</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To copy a file tree including
the Access Control List entries for all files and to
correctly copy sparse (holey) files use:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">example% star -copy -p -xdot
-acl -sparse -C /home/someuser . /home/fs</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To compare the content of a tape
to the filesystem one might use:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">example% star -diff -v
f=/dev/rmt/1bn</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To compare two directory trees
one might use:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">example% star -c . | star -C
todir -diff -v diffopts=!times</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or better by using a method
similar to the -copy method above:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">example% star -c -diff -v
diffopts=!times -C fromdir . todir</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To compare all properties of two
file trees, use:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">example% star -c -diff -vv -dump
-acl -sparse -C fromdir . todir</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To extract a backup of the /usr
tree without all files residing below /usr/openwin one might
use:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">example% star -xp -V
pat=openwin/f=/dev/rmt/1bn</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To extract all .c files to src,
all .o files to obj and all other files to /tmp one might
use:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">example% star -xp -C src
&rsquo;*.c&rsquo; -C obj &rsquo;*.o&rsquo; -C /tmp
&rsquo;*&rsquo; f=/dev/rmt/1bn</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To extract files from a zipped
tar archive that is located on a read only filesystem e.g. a
CD while having the shell&rsquo;s working directory on the
CD one might use:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">example% star -zxp -C /tmp
f=star-1.1.tar.gz</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">to extract the files from the
tar archive to the /tmp directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To backup a list of files
generated by the find(1) command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">example% find . find_options
-print | star -c list=- f=/dev/rmt/1bn</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that this does not work if
the file names from output of the find command include new
line characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To extract a tarfile that
contains a tarfile one might use:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">example% star -x -to-stdout
f=/dev/rmt/1bn pat=pat | star -xp</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pat, in this case should match
the tarfile in the tarfile on tape that should be
extracted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To make a backup of the root
filesystem to a tape drive connected to a remote machine,
one might use:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">example# cd / <br>
example# star -cM fs=128m bs=63k
f=tape@remotehost:/dev/rmt/1bn .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You need a line in /etc/passwd
like the following to enable this:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">tape:NP:60001:60001:Tape:/etc/tapehome:/opt/schily/sbin/rmt</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">And a .rhosts file in
/etc/tapehome to allow remote connections from the
appropriate hosts. Make sure that the file /etc/default/rmt
exists and allows remote access to the <br>
requested tape drive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To use a ssh(1) connection for a
backup to a remote tape server, one might use:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">example# env RSH=/usr/bin/ssh
star -cM fs=128m bs=63k f=tape@remotehost:/dev/rmt/1bn .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To repair a corrupted filesystem
for which no recent backup exists, do the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">example# fsck -y /filesys <br>
example# mount /filesys <br>
example# cd /filesys <br>
example# star -xpk f=/dev/rmt/1bn <br>
example# mt -f /dev/rmt/1bn rewind <br>
example# star -diff -v diffopts=!times f=/dev/rmt/1bn</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Now check the differences and
decide whether to restore additional files. This may be done
by generating a list containing the needed filenames and
using the list= option or by <br>
using the interactive mode (see -w option).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want a list that only
contains all filenames from files with differences you may
use:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">example# star -diff -tpath
diffopts=!times f=/dev/rmt/1bn</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are looking for files
that changed the type or the access permission because this
is a common case on still corrupted files, use:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">example# star -diff -tpath
diffopts=type,perm f=/dev/rmt/1bn</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you like to archive all
directories only that are part of the directory tree under
&quot;.&quot;, use:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">example# star -c f=archive-name
-find . -type d</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you like to archive all files
as owner root and group root and make all files world
readable in the archive, use:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">example# star -c f=archive-name
-find . -chown root -chgrp root -chmod o+r</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you like to list all files in
an archive in a way like sfind(1), instead of the way used
by star, use:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">example# star -t f=archive-name
-find . -ls -false</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
STAR_COMPRESS_FLAG <br>
If you like star to always create compressed files that use
maximum compression, you may set the environment variable
STAR_COMPRESS_FLAG to -9.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STAR_DEBUG <br>
If this environment variable is present, star will not
remove temporary files from ./star-tmpdir. The files in this
directory are files that have been removed by users <br>
before the last incremental dump did take place on the
master filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STAR_FIFOSIZE <br>
If you like to by default let star use a different fifo
size, set this environment variable to the desired size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TAPE Unlike other tar(1)
implementations, star defaults to use stdin/stdout for the
archive. If you like star to use the file name from the TAPE
environment instead, you need <br>
to specify the -T option too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RSH If the RSH environment is
present, the remote connection will not be created via
rcmd(3) but by calling the program pointed to by RSH. Use
e.g. RSH=/usr/bin/ssh to cre&acirc; <br>
ate a secure shell connection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that this forces star to
create a pipe to the rsh(1) program and disallows star to
directly access the network socket to the remote server.
This makes it impossible <br>
to set up performance parameters and slows down the
connection compared to a root initiated rcmd(3)
connection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See BUGS section for more
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RMT If the RMT environment is
present, the remote tape server will not be the program
/etc/rmt but the program pointed to by RMT. Note that the
remote tape server program <br>
name will be ignored if you log in using an account that has
been created with a remote tape server program as login
shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/etc/default/star <br>
Default values can be set for the following options in
/etc/default/star. For example: CDR_FIFOSIZE=64m</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STAR_FIFOSIZE <br>
Sets the default size of the FIFO (see also fs=#
option).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STAR_FIFOSIZE_MAX <br>
Sets the maximum size of the FIFO (see also fs=# option).
Setting STAR_FIFOSIZE_MAX in /etc/default/star allows to
overwrite global values from backup scripts for <br>
machines with less memory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">archive0=</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">archive1=</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">archive2=</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">archive3=</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">archive4=</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">archive5=</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">archive6=</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">archive7= <br>
Archive entries for the -[0..7] option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A correct archive?= line has
3..4 space separated entries. The first is the device entry
(e.g. archive0=/dev/tape). The second is the blocking factor
in 512 byte <br>
units. The third is the maximum media size in 1024 byte
units. If this entry contains a 0, then the media size is
unlimited. The fourth entry is optional. If it <br>
contains a &rsquo;n&rsquo; or a &rsquo;N&rsquo;, then the
archive device is not a tape.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">archive0=/dev/tape 512 0 y <br>
archive1=/dev/fd0 1 1440 n <br>
archive2=/dev/rmt/0mbn 512 0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the default file does not
need to be shared with the tar program from Solaris, any
number may be used like a generic size option like bs=.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">archive0=/dev/tape 256k 40G
y</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/tardumps <br>
The default name for the dump level archive. The default
name is used whenever the tardumps=name option has not been
specified. The file is written or updated when -wtar&acirc;
<br>
dumps is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The file holds one or more
lines, each specifying a dump level entry. Each dump level
entry starts with a mount point name followed by a TAB and
one or more spaces, fol&acirc; <br>
lowed by the decimal dump level, a space and the dump
time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the dump level is directly
followed by a &rsquo;P&rsquo;, then the dump refers to a
partial dump (a dump that does not include the whole
filesystem).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The dump time itself includes
the decimal representation of the UTC seconds since Jan 01
1970, a space and the textual local time representation of
the dump time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The numerical decimal dump time
representation may be followed by a dot and a sub second
value. The textual local time representation is for
informational use by humans <br>
only and not evaluated by star.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">./star-symtable <br>
Contains a database that is needed in incremental restore
mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">./star-symdump <br>
Contains an intermediate dump of restore database after a
fatal error condition was met during an incremental restore

storage by star if in incremental restore mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">./star-lock <br>
Is a lock file created by star when doing an incremental

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
The command line syntax for the tar command (as defined in
SUSv2 - UNIX-98) deviates from the command line syntax
defined for all other commands. While the POSIX command line
<br>
syntax requests all options to start with a dash (-) and
allows to either write options separately or combined (in
case of boolean flags), the tar command line syntax requires
<br>
all options to be combined into a single string that does
not start with a dash. Star by default assumes a command
line syntax like a typical POSIX command and includes a
com&acirc; <br>
patibility mode that allows to specify a command line syntax
as documented for the UNIX-98 tar command. If you believe
that you found a bug in the way star parses the command <br>
line, please first check your command line for correctness
before you make a bug report for star.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you like to write portable
shell scripts that call tar, use the UNIX-98 tar command
line syntax (i.e. a single option string and no dash),
choose the commands and options from <br>
the following set of characters ( rxtuc vxfblmo ) and check
the shell script with both, your local tar and star for
correct behavior. It you expect the script to call gnutar,
do <br>
not include the -o option as gnutar implements this option
in a way that violates UNIX-98.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Star strips leading ./ sequences
from pathnames. This lets star in many cases store longer
pathnames than other implementations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The POSIX.1-1988 method (ustar
format) of storing files with pathnames that are longer than
100 chars has some limitations:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The name field (100 chars) an
inserted slash (&lsquo;/&rsquo;) and the prefix field (155
chars) produce the pathname of the file. When recreating the
original filename, name and pre&acirc; <br>
fix are concatenated, using a slash character in the middle.
If a pathname does not fit in the space provided or may not
be split at a slash character so that the parts <br>
will fit into 100 + 155 chars, the file may not be archived.
Linknames longer than 100 chars may not be archived too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The star, xstar, xustar,
exustar, pax, and gnutar archive formats don&rsquo;t have
these limitations. While gnutar uses a method that makes it
impossible for other tar implementations <br>
(except star) to restore filenames that are longer than 100
chars, the xstar, xustar, exustar and pax archive format
uses a method that allows an POSIX.1-1988 compliant way of
<br>
storing filenames, if the POSIX method would allow this.
When the archive format is xustar, exustar or pax very long
filenames are stored using extended headers from the <br>
POSIX.1-2001 standard.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some buggy tar implementations
will generate incorrect filenames during a restore operation
if the archive contains pathnames or linknames of exactly
100 chars length.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Star adds a tar signature in the
last four bytes of each tar header if the archive format is
star or xstar. This is no problem with the star archive
format as it is an extension <br>
of the old pre POSIX.1-1988 tar format. On the other side,
the xstar archive format claims to be as POSIX.1-1988
compliant as possible. Inserting this tar signature is a
minor <br>
deviation from the standard that has the last 12 bytes of
each header reserved for future use. On the other side, tar
implementations such as some pax implementations that only
<br>
compute checksums on the first 500 bytes of the header are
violating the standard that requests the checksum to be
computed on all 512 bytes of the tar header. All tar
implemen&acirc; <br>
tations that are 100% Posix compliant will be able to
extract xstar archives as long as no new standard is defined
that claims the last 12 bytes of the header for a different
<br>
use. But then the ustar version number should be changed
from &lsquo;00&rsquo; to &lsquo;01&rsquo;. Now, that the
POSIX-2001 standard has been accepted, it is even
predictable that all extensions to <br>
the standard tar format will go into the POSIX.1-2001
extended headers which are extensible to include any feature
without future limitation. The only known tar implementation
<br>
that also uses the last 12 bytes of the tar header is
Sun&rsquo;s tar which uses these 12 bytes for files that are
split over several archives. Such archives created by
Sun&rsquo;s tar are <br>
not readable by the buggy pax implementation too. The Sun
extension is not incompatible to the star signature because
Sun expects an octal number at the beginning of the 12 byte
<br>
field which is a null character in the star case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Star uses these four bytes since
1985 without problems. If you need a 100% POSIX.1-1988 and
100% POSIX.1-2001 compliant tar archive, you may use the
xustar, exustar or the pax <br>
archive format. The probability of falsely detecting other
tar formats as xustar or exustar format however is
higher.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is no way to ask for the
n-th occurrence of a file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The way EOF is handled by star
differs, whether the fifo is in effect or not. If the fifo
is not used, star stops reading the archive if it encounters
a logical EOF record in <br>
the archive. If the fifo is used, star may read until the
fifo is full or until the real EOF mark on tape is reached.
How much data star actually reads depends on the time when
<br>
the star foreground process sends a fifo shutdown signal to
the background fifo read process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Gnu tar often creates tar
archives with incorrect logical EOF marks. The standard
requires two blocks that are completely zeroed, whereas
gnutar often only adds one of them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Old versions of tar found on
SYSVr3 and earlier cannot read tar archives with a blocksize
greater than 10 kBytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The method of storing sparse
files currently used with the star and xstar format is not
guaranteed to be used in later versions of star. If the
author decides to change this <br>
method, later versions of star may not be able to restore
sparse files from tar archives made by the current version
of star.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some tar implementations violate
the standard in using only the first 500 Bytes of the header
for checksum computation. These tar implementations will not
accept star and xstar <br>
type tar archives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sun&rsquo;s Solaris 2.x tar
implementation violates the Posix standard. Tar archives
generated by star cause Sun&rsquo;s tar to print tar:
impossible file type messages. You may ignore these <br>
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Gnutar&rsquo;s dumpdirs are non
standard and are currently not implemented.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If gnutar archives sparse files
with more than four holes, it produces archives that violate
the standard in a way that prevents other tar
implementations to read these archives. <br>
Star knows about that and is able to handle these gnutar
archives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The filetype N (LF_NAMES) from
gnutar (an obsolete method of storing long names) will never
be implemented.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that on operating systems
(like DOS) that do not implement real pipes, star implements
compression via a temporary file. Using compression thus is
limited by the maximum <br>
file size and the available disk space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The extended file flags
implementation (see -xfflags option) on Linux is buggy by
design. In order to retrieve the needed information, every
file needs to be opened. If the <br>
/dev directory is included in create mode, every possible
driver will be loaded which may hang the system for a long
time. In the worst case, unwanted side effects from opening
<br>
devices (such as causing tape drives to rewind the media)
may be caused.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SECURITY NOTES <br>
If you unpack a tar archive in a non empty directory, any
file in that directory may be overwritten unless you specify
the -k option. If the archive contains symbolic links or
<br>
hard links, star may even overwrite files outside the
current directory. If the directory where the archive is
been unpacked is not empty and contains contains symbolic
links or <br>
hard links to directories outside that directory, star may
also overwrite files outside the current directory. As many
other commands, star usually has all possible permissions
<br>
when run as root. Unpacking archives as root thus may have
fatal results to any file on your system. Be very careful
when you try to extract an archive that has not been
cre&acirc; <br>
ated by you. It is possible to create hand crafted tar
archives that may overwrite critical files (like
/etc/passwd) on your system. In addition all tar archives
that have been <br>
created with the list= option and tar archives where the C=
option was not specified before all file type arguments may
be critical.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A good advise is to extract all
doubtful archives as non root in an empty directory and to
specify the -secure-links option. If you get a warning, you
should unpack the archive <br>
a second time and specify the options -k, -w and -nowarn in
addition to the options used for the first run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SUID NOTES <br>
If star is installed suid root, star is able to make
connections to remote archives for non root users. This is
done by using the rcmd(3) interface to get a connection to a
<br>
rmt(8) server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Star resets its effective uid
back to the real user id immediately after setting up the
remote connection to the rmt server and before opening any
other file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If star has not been installed
suid root and not called by root, it will try to create the
remote connection via rsh(1) or ssh(1) (in case the
environment RSH has been set to <br>
ssh). Note that in this case, the throughput to the remote
tape server will be much lower than with a connection that
has been initiated via rcmd(3).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LIMITATIONS <br>
If star is running on a large file aware platform, star is
able to handle files up to 8 GB in a mode that is compliant
to the POSIX.1-1988 ustar format. With a nonstandard star
<br>
specific extension, up to 95 bits may be used to code the
filesize. This will handle files up to 200,000,000 TB. With
the new POSIX.1-2001 extended headers used by the xustar,
<br>
exustar and pax format, any filesize may be archived.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
The fact that the -f option has to be implemented in a way
that is compatible with old tar implementations gives
several problems. The options -fifostats, -force-hole, <br>
-force-remove and -fifo interfere with the -f option and the
fact that they exist prevents users from using filenames
like e.g. ifo using the traditional way where the filename
<br>
directly follows the string -f without any space between the
option name and the file name. However, there is no problem
to use a file named ifo by by calling -f ifo, f=ifo, <br>
-f=ifo or -f= ifo. Be careful not to make typos with the
above options. The result could be that a file is created as
a result of the mistyped option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is currently no way to set
the fifo lowwater and highwater marks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is currently no way to
automatically delete files in the target file tree if they
are obsolete. Star should implement something similar to
gnutar&rsquo;s dumpdirs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If not invoked by the super user
star may not be able to extract files if they reside in read
only directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Star is not able to make a
complete backup of a filesystem if files are hidden by a
mount that is in effect on a directory of this filesystem.
This may be avoided in case of the <br>
ufs filesystem if the backup is made off a ufs snapshot (see
the man page for fssnap(1m) It could be avoided for any
filesystem if the loopback filesystem had an option that
<br>
tells lofs not to traverse mountpoints.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For now (late 2002), we know
that the following programs are broken and do not implement
signal handling correctly:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rsh on SunOS-5.0...SunOS-5.9</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ssh from ssh.com</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ssh from openssh.org</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sun already did accept a bug
report for rsh(1)/ssh(1). Openssh.org accepted and fixed a
bug for their implementation of ssh(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you use star to create a
remote connection via an unfixed rsh(1) or ssh(1), be
prepared that terminal generated signals may interrupt the
remote connection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY <br>
Star was first created in 1982 to extract tapes on a UNIX
clone that had no tar command. In 1985 the first fully
functional version has been released as mtar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the old star format
extensions have been introduced in 1985, it was renamed to
star (Schily tar). In 1994, Posix 1003.1-1988 extensions
were added and star was renamed to <br>
star (Standard tar).</p>
