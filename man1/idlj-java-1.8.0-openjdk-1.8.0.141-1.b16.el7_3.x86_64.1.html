<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
idlj - Generates Java bindings for a specified Interface
Definition Language (IDL) file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
idlj [ options ] idlfile</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">options <br>
The command-line options. See Options. Options can appear in
any order, but must precede the idlfile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">idlfile <br>
The name of a file that contains Interface Definition
Language (IDL) definitions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The IDL-to-Java Compiler generates the Java bindings for a
specified IDL file. For binding details, see Java IDL: IDL
to Java Language Mapping at <br>

http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/idl/mapping/jidlMapping.html</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some earlier releases of the
IDL-to-Java compiler were named idltojava.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EMIT CLIENT AND SERVER BINDINGS
<br>
The following idlj command generates an IDL file named
My.idl with client-side bindings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">idlj My.idl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The previous syntax is
equivalent to the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">idlj -fclient My.idl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The next example generates the
server-side bindings, and includes the client-side bindings
plus the skeleton, all of which are POA (Inheritance
Model).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">idlg -fserver My.idl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to generate both
client and server-side bindings, then use one of the
following (equivalent) commands:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">idlj -fclient -fserver My.idl
<br>
idlj -fall My.idl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are two possible
server-side models: the Portal Servant Inheritance Model and
the Tie Model. See Tie Delegation Model.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Portable Servant Inheritance
Model. The default server-side model is the Portable Servant
Inheritance Model. Given an interface My defined in My.idl,
the file MyPOA.java is <br>
generated. You must provide the implementation for the My
interface, and the My interface must inherit from the MyPOA
class. MyPOA.java is a stream-based skeleton that extends
<br>
the org.omg.PortableServer.Servant class at
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/org/omg/PortableServer/Servant.html
The My interface implements the callHandler interface and
<br>
the operations interface associated with the IDL interface
the skeleton implements.The PortableServer module for the
Portable Object Adapter (POA) defines the native Servant
<br>
type. See Portable Object Adapter (POA) at
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/idl/POA.html
In the Java programming language, the Servant type is mapped
to the <br>
Java org.omg.PortableServer.Servant class. It serves as the
base class for all POA servant implementations and provides
a number of methods that can be called by the application
<br>
programmer, and methods that are called by the POA and that
can be overridden by the user to control aspects of servant
behavior.Another option for the Inheritance Model is to <br>
use the -oldImplBase flag to generate server-side bindings
that are compatible with releases of the Java programming
language before Java SE 1.4. The -oldImplBase flag is <br>
nonstandard, and these APIs are deprecated. You would use
this flag only for compatibility with existing servers
written in Java SE 1.3. In that case, you would need to
modify an <br>
existing make file to add the -oldImplBase flag to the idlj
compiler. Otherwise POA-based server-side mappings are
generated. To generate server-side bindings that are
backward <br>
compatible, do the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">idlj -fclient -fserver
-oldImplBase My.idl <br>
idlj -fall -oldImplBase My.idl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Given an interface My defined in
My.idl, the file _MyImplBase.java is generated. You must
provide the implementation for the My interface, and the My
interface must inherit from <br>
the _MyImplBase class.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tie Delegation Model. The other
server-side model is called the Tie Model. This is a
delegation model. Because it is not possible to generate
ties and skeletons at the same time, <br>
they must be generated separately. The following commands
generate the bindings for the Tie Model:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">idlj -fall My.idl <br>
idlj -fallTIE My.idl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For the My interface, the second
command generates MyPOATie.java. The constructor to the
MyPOATie class takes a delegate. In this example, using the
default POA model, the <br>
constructor also needs a POA. You must provide the
implementation for the delegate, but it does not have to
inherit from any other class, only the interface
MyOperations. To use <br>
it with the ORB, you must wrap your implementation within
the MyPOATie class, for example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ORB orb = ORB.init(args,
System.getProperties()); <br>
// Get reference to rootpoa &amp; activate the POAManager
<br>
POA rootpoa =
(POA)orb.resolve_initial_references(&quot;RootPOA&quot;);
<br>
rootpoa.the_POAManager().activate(); <br>
// create servant and register it with the ORB <br>
MyServant myDelegate = new MyServant(); <br>
myDelegate.setORB(orb); <br>
// create a tie, with servant being the delegate. <br>
MyPOATie tie = new MyPOATie(myDelegate, rootpoa); <br>
// obtain the objectRef for the tie <br>
My ref = tie._this(orb);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You might want to use the Tie
model instead of the typical Inheritance model when your
implementation must inherit from some other implementation.
Java allows any number of <br>
interface inheritance, but there is only one slot for class
inheritance. If you use the inheritance model, then that
slot is used up. With the Tie Model, that slot is freed up
<br>
for your own use. The drawback is that it introduces a level
of indirection: one extra method call occurs when a method
is called.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For server-side generation, Tie
model bindings that are compatible with versions of the IDL
to Java language mapping in versions earlier than Java SE
1.4.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">idlj -oldImplBase -fall My.idl
<br>
idlj -oldImplBase -fallTIE My.idl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For the My interface, the this
generates My_Tie.java. The constructor to the My_Tie class
takes an impl object. You must provide the implementation
for impl, but it does not have <br>
to inherit from any other class, only the interface
HelloOperations. But to use it with the ORB, you must wrap
your implementation within My_Tie, for example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ORB orb = ORB.init(args,
System.getProperties()); <br>
// create servant and register it with the ORB <br>
MyServant myDelegate = new MyServant(); <br>
myDelegate.setORB(orb); <br>
// create a tie, with servant being the delegate. <br>
MyPOATie tie = new MyPOATie(myDelegate); <br>
// obtain the objectRef for the tie <br>
My ref = tie._this(orb);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SPECIFY ALTERNATE LOCATIONS FOR
EMITTED FILES <br>
If you want to direct the emitted files to a directory other
than the current directory, then call the compiler this way:
idlj -td /altdir My.idl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For the My interface, the
bindings are emitted to /altdir/My.java, etc., instead of
./My.java.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SPECIFY ALTERNATE LOCATIONS FOR
INCLUDE FILES <br>
If the My.idl file includes another idl file, MyOther.idl,
then the compiler assumes that the MyOther.idl file resides
in the local directory. If it resides in /includes, for <br>
example, then you call the compiler with the following
command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">idlj -i /includes My.idl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If My.idl also included
Another.idl that resided in /moreIncludes, for example, then
you call the compiler with the following command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">idlj -i /includes -i
/moreIncludes My.idl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Because this form of include can
become long, another way to indicate to the compiler where
to search for included files is provided. This technique is
similar to the idea of an <br>
environment variable. Create a file named idl.config in a
directory that is listed in your CLASSPATH variable. Inside
of idl.config, provide a line with the following form:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">includes=/includes;/moreIncludes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The compiler will find this file
and read in the includes list. Note that in this example the
separator character between the two directories is a
semicolon (;). This separator <br>
character is platform dependent. On the Windows platform,
use a semicolon, on the Unix platform, use a colon, and so
on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EMIT BINDINGS FOR INCLUDE FILES
<br>
By default, only those interfaces, structures, and so on,
that are defined in the idl file on the command line have
Java bindings generated for them. The types defined in <br>
included files are not generated. For example, assume the
following two idl files:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">My.idl file: <br>
#include &lt;MyOther.idl&gt; <br>
interface My <br>
{ <br>
}; <br>
MyOther.idl file: <br>
interface MyOther <br>
{ <br>
};</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is a caveat to the default
rule. Any #include statements that appear at the global
scope are treated as described. These #include statements
can be thought of as import <br>
statements. The #include statements that appear within an
enclosed scope are treated as true #include statements,
which means that the code within the included file is
treated as <br>
though it appeared in the original file and, therefore, Java
bindings are emitted for it. Here is an example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">My.idl file: <br>
#include &lt;MyOther.idl&gt; <br>
interface My <br>
{ <br>
#include &lt;Embedded.idl&gt; <br>
}; <br>
MyOther.idl file: <br>
interface MyOther <br>
{ <br>
}; <br>
Embedded.idl <br>
enum E {one, two, three};</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Runidlj My.idlto generate the
following list of Java files. Notice that MyOther.java is
not generated because it is defined in an import-like
#include. But E.java was generated <br>
because it was defined in a true #include. Notice that
because the Embedded.idl file is included within the scope
of the interface My, it appears within the scope of My (in
<br>
MyPackage). If the -emitAll flag had been used, then all
types in all included files would have been emitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">./MyHolder.java <br>
./MyHelper.java <br>
./_MyStub.java <br>
./MyPackage <br>
./MyPackage/EHolder.java <br>
./MyPackage/EHelper.java <br>
./MyPackage/E.java <br>
./My.java</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INSERT PACKAGE PREFIXES <br>
Suppose that you work for a company named ABC that has
constructed the following IDL file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Widgets.idl file: <br>
module Widgets <br>
{ <br>
interface W1 {...}; <br>
interface W2 {...}; <br>
};</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you run this file through the
IDL-to-Java compiler, then the Java bindings for W1 and W2
are placed within the Widgets package. There is an industry
convention that states <br>
that a company&rsquo;s packages should reside within a
package named com.&lt;company name&gt;. To follow this
convention, the package name should be com.abc.Widgets. To
place this package <br>
prefix onto the Widgets module, execute the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">idlj -pkgPrefix Widgets com.abc
Widgets.idl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you have an IDL file that
includes Widgets.idl, then the -pkgPrefix flag must appear
in that command also. If it does not, then your IDL file
will be looking for a Widgets <br>
package rather than a com.abc.Widgets package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you have a number of these
packages that require prefixes, then it might be easier to
place them into the idl.config file described previously.
Each package prefix line should <br>
be of the form: PkgPrefix.&lt;type&gt;=&lt;prefix&gt;. The
line for the previous example would be
PkgPrefix.Widgets=com.abc. This option does not affect the
Repository ID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEFINE SYMBOLS BEFORE
COMPILATION <br>
You might need to define a symbol for compilation that is
not defined within the IDL file, perhaps to include
debugging code in the bindings. The command idlj -d MYDEF
My.idlis <br>
equivalent to putting the line #define MYDEF inside
My.idl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PRESERVE PREEXISTING BINDINGS
<br>
If the Java binding files already exist, then the -keep flag
keeps the compiler from overwriting them. The default is to
generate all files without considering that they already
<br>
exist. If you have customized those files (which you should
not do unless you are very comfortable with their contents),
then the -keep option is very useful. The command idlj <br>
-keep My.idl emits all client-side bindings that do not
already exist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VIEW COMPILATION PROGRESS <br>
The IDL-to-Java compiler generates status messages as it
progresses through its phases of execution. Use the -v
option to activate the verbose mode: idlj -v My.idl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default the compiler does not
operate in verbose mode</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DISPLAY VERSION INFORMATION <br>
To display the build version of the IDL-to-Java compiler,
specify the -version option on the command-line: idlj
-version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Version information also appears
within the bindings generated by the compiler. Any
additional options appearing on the command-line are
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-d symbol <br>
This is equivalent to the following line in an IDL file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#define symbol</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-demitAll <br>
Emit all types, including those found in #include files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fside <br>
Defines what bindings to emit. The side parameter can be
client, server, serverTIE, all, or allTIE. The -fserverTIE
and -fallTIE options cause delegate model skeletons to <br>
be emitted. Defaults to -fclient when the flag is not
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i include-path <br>
By default, the current directory is scanned for included
files. This option adds another directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i keep <br>
If a file to be generated already exists, then do not
overwrite it. By default it is overwritten.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-noWarn <br>
Suppress warning messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-oldImplBase <br>
Generates skeletons compatible with pre-1.4 JDK ORBs. By
default, the POA Inheritance Model server-side bindings are
generated. This option provides backward-compatibility <br>
with earlier releases of the Java programming language by
generating server-side bindings that are ImplBase
Inheritance Model classes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pkgPrefix typeprefix <br>
Wherever type is encountered at file scope, prefix the
generated Java package name with prefix for all files
generated for that type. The type is the simple name of
either <br>
a top-level module, or an IDL type defined outside of any
module.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pkgTranslate typepackage <br>
Whenever the module name type is encountered in an
identifier, replace it in the identifier with package for
all files in the generated Java package. Note that pkgPrefix
<br>
changes are made first. The type value is the simple name of
either a top-level module, or an IDL type defined outside of
any module and must match the full package name <br>
exactly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If more than one translation
matches an identifier, then the longest match is chosen as
shown in the following example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pkgTranslate type pkg
-pkgTranslate type2.baz pkg2.fizz</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Resulting Translation:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">type =&gt; pkg <br>
type.ext =&gt; pkg.ext <br>
type.baz =&gt; pkg2.fizz <br>
type2.baz.pkg =&gt; pkg2.fizz.pkg</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following package names org,
org.omg, or any subpackages of org.omg cannot be translated.
Any attempt to translate these packages results in
uncompilable code, and the <br>
use of these packages as the first argument after
-pkgTranslate is treated as an error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-skeletonName xxx%yyy <br>
Use xxx%yyy as the pattern for naming the skeleton. The
defaults are: %POA for the POA base class (-fserver or
-fall), and _%ImplBase for the oldImplBase class <br>
(-oldImplBase) and (-fserver or -fall)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-td dir <br>
Use dir for the output directory instead of the current
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-tieName xxx%yyy <br>
Use xxx%yyy according to the pattern. The defaults are: %POA
for the POA base class (-fserverTie or -fallTie), and _%Tie
for the oldImplBase tie class (-oldImplBase) and <br>
(-fserverTie or -fallTie))</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nowarn, -verbose <br>
Displays release information and terminates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-version <br>
Displays release information and terminates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RESTRICTIONS <br>
Escaped identifiers in the global scope cannot have the same
spelling as IDL primitive types, Object, or ValueBase. This
is because the symbol table is preloaded with these <br>
identifiers. Allowing them to be redefined would overwrite
their original definitions. Possible permanent
restriction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The fixed IDL type is not
supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KNOWN PROBLEMS <br>
No import is generated for global identifiers. If you call
an unexported local impl object, then you do get an
exception, but it seems to be due to a NullPointerException
in the <br>
ServerDelegate DSI code.</p>
