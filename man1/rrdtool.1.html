It is pretty easy to gather status information from all sorts of things, ranging
  from the temperature in your office to the number of octets which have passed
  through the FDDI interface of your router. But it is not so trivial to store
  this data in an efficient and systematic manner. This is where <b>RRDtool</b>
  comes in handy. It lets you <i>log and analyze</i> the data you gather from
  all kinds of data-sources ( <b>DS</b>). The data analysis part of RRDtool is
  based on the ability to quickly generate graphical representations of the data
  values collected over a definable time period.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In this man page you will find general information on the design and
  functionality of the Round Robin Database Tool (RRDtool). For a more detailed
  description of how to use the individual functions of <b>RRDtool</b> check the
  corresponding man page.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For an introduction to the usage of RRDtool make sure you consult the
  rrdtutorial.

While the man pages talk of command line switches you have to set in order to
  make <b>RRDtool</b> work it is important to note that <b>RRDtool</b> can be
  remotely controlled through a set of pipes. This saves a considerable amount
  of startup time when you plan to make <b>RRDtool</b> do a lot of things
  quickly. Check the section on Remote_Control further down. There is also a
  number of language bindings for RRDtool which allow you to use it directly
  from Perl, python, Tcl, PHP, etc.

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">Data Acquisition</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">When monitoring the state of a system, it is convenient to
      have the data available at a constant time interval. Unfortunately, you
      may not always be able to fetch data at exactly the time you want to.
      Therefore <b>RRDtool</b> lets you update the log file at any time you
      want. It will automatically interpolate the value of the data-source (
      <b>DS</b>) at the latest official time-slot (interval) and write this
      interpolated value to the log. The original value you have supplied is
      stored as well and is also taken into account when interpolating the next
      log entry.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">Consolidation</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">You may log data at a 1 minute interval, but you might also
      be interested to know the development of the data over the last year. You
      could do this by simply storing the data in 1 minute intervals for the
      whole year. While this would take considerable disk space it would also
      take a lot of time to analyze the data when you wanted to create a graph
      covering the whole year. <b>RRDtool</b> offers a solution to this problem
      through its data consolidation feature. When setting up an Round Robin
      Database ( <b>RRD</b>), you can define at which interval this
      consolidation should occur, and what consolidation function ( <b>CF</b>)
      (average, minimum, maximum, total, last) should be used to build the
      consolidated values (see rrdcreate). You can define any number of
      different consolidation setups within one <b>RRD</b>. They will all be
      maintained on the fly when new data is loaded into the <b>RRD</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">Round Robin Archives</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Data values of the same consolidation setup are stored into
      Round Robin Archives ( <b>RRA</b>). This is a very efficient manner to
      store data for a certain amount of time, while using a known and constant
      amount of storage space.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    It works like this: If you want to store 1'000 values in 5 minute interval,
      <b>RRDtool</b> will allocate space for 1'000 data values and a header
      area. In the header it will store a pointer telling which slots (value) in
      the storage area was last written to. New values are written to the Round
      Robin Archive in, you guessed it, a round robin manner. This automatically
      limits the history to the last 1'000 values (in our example). Because you
      can define several <b>RRA</b>s within a single <b>RRD</b>, you can setup
      another one, for storing 750 data values at a 2 hour interval, for
      example, and thus keep a log for the last two months at a lower
      resolution.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The use of <b>RRA</b>s guarantees that the <b>RRD</b> does not grow over
      time and that old data is automatically eliminated. By using the
      consolidation feature, you can still keep data for a very long time, while
      gradually reducing the resolution of the data along the time axis.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Using different consolidation functions ( <b>CF</b>) allows you to store
      exactly the type of information that actually interests you: the maximum
      one minute traffic on the LAN, the minimum temperature of your wine
      cellar, the total minutes of down time, etc.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">Unknown Data</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">As mentioned earlier, the <b>RRD</b> stores data at a
      constant interval. Sometimes it may happen that no new data is available
      when a value has to be written to the <b>RRD</b>. Data acquisition may not
      be possible for one reason or other. With <b>RRDtool</b> you can handle
      these situations by storing an <i>*UNKNOWN*</i> value into the database.
      The value ' <i>*UNKNOWN*</i>' is supported through all the functions of
      the tool. When consolidating a data set, the amount of <i>*UNKNOWN*</i>
      data values is accounted for and when a new consolidated value is ready to
      be written to its Round Robin Archive ( <b>RRA</b>), a validity check is
      performed to make sure that the percentage of unknown values in the data
      point is above a configurable level. If not, an <i>*UNKNOWN*</i> value
      will be written to the <b>RRA</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">Graphing</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>RRDtool</b> allows you to generate reports in numerical
      and graphical form based on the data stored in one or several <b>RRD</b>s.
      The graphing feature is fully configurable. Size, color and contents of
      the graph can be defined freely. Check rrdgraph for more information on
      this.</dd>

  <dd class="It-tag">A mechanism to decide if and when an observed value or

</dl>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 8.00ex;">
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Here is a brief explanation of these components:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The Holt-Winters time series forecasting algorithm is an on-line (or
  incremental) algorithm that adaptively predicts future observations in a time
  series. Its forecast is the sum of three components: a baseline (or
  intercept), a linear trend over time (or slope), and a seasonal coefficient (a
  periodic effect, such as a daily cycle). There is one seasonal coefficient for
  each time point in the period (cycle). After a value is observed, each of
  these components is updated via exponential smoothing. This means that the
  algorithm &quot;learns&quot; from past values and uses them to predict the
  future. The rate of adaptation is governed by 3 parameters, alpha (intercept),
  beta (slope), and gamma (seasonal). The prediction can also be viewed as a
  smoothed value for the time series.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The measure of deviation is a seasonal weighted absolute deviation. The term
  <i>seasonal</i> means deviation is measured separately for each time point in
  the seasonal cycle. As with Holt-Winters forecasting, deviation is predicted
  using the measure computed from past values (but only at that point in the
  seasonal cycle). After the value is observed, the algorithm learns from the
  observed value via exponential smoothing. Confidence bands for the observed
  time series are generated by scaling the sequence of predicted deviation
  values (we usually think of the sequence as a continuous line rather than a
  set of discrete points).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Aberrant behavior (a potential failure) is reported whenever the number of times
  the observed value violates the confidence bands meets or exceeds a specified
  threshold within a specified temporal window (e.g. 5 violations during the
  past 45 minutes with a value observed every 5 minutes).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This functionality is embedded in a set of related <b>RRAs</b>. In particular, a
  FAILURES <b>RRA</b> logs potential failures. With these data you could, for
  example, use a front-end application to <b>RRDtool</b> to initiate real-time
  alerts.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
For a detailed description on how to set this up, see rrdcreate.</div>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="REMOTE_CONTROL"><a class="selflink" href="#REMOTE_CONTROL">REMOTE
  CONTROL</a></h2>
When you start <b>RRDtool</b> with the command line option '<b>-</b>' it waits
  for input via standard input (STDIN). With this feature you can improve
  performance by attaching <b>RRDtool</b> to another process (MRTG is one
  example) through a set of pipes. Over these pipes <b>RRDtool</b> accepts the
  same arguments as on the command line and some special commands like <b>quit,
  cd, mkdir</b> and <b>ls</b>. For detailed help on the server commands type:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   rrdtool help cd|mkdir|pwd|ls|quit
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
When a command is completed, RRDtool will print the string '&quot;OK&quot;',
  followed by timing information of the form <b>u:</b><i>usertime</i>
  <b>s:</b><i>systemtime</i>. Both values are the running totals of seconds
  since RRDtool was started. If an error occurs, a line of the form
  '&quot;ERROR:&quot; <i>Description of error</i>' will be printed instead.
  <b>RRDtool</b> will not abort, unless something really serious happens. If a
  <b>workdir</b> is specified and the UID is 0, RRDtool will do a chroot to that
  workdir. If the UID is not 0, RRDtool only changes the current directory to
  <b>workdir</b>.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="RRD_Server"><a class="selflink" href="#RRD_Server">RRD
  Server</a></h2>
If you want to create a RRD-Server, you must choose a TCP/IP Service number and
  add them to <i>/etc/services</i> like this:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 rrdsrv      13900/tcp                       # RRD server
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Attention: the TCP port 13900 isn't officially registered for rrdsrv. You can
  use any unused port in your services file, but the server and the client
  system must use the same port, of course.
<div class="Pp"></div>
With this configuration you can add RRDtool as meta-server to
  <i>/etc/inetd.conf</i>. For example:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 rrdsrv stream tcp nowait root /opt/rrd/bin/rrdtool rrdtool - /var/rrd
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Don't forget to create the database directory /var/rrd and reinitialize your
  inetd.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If all was setup correctly, you can access the server with Perl sockets, tools
  like netcat, or in a quick interactive test by using 'telnet localhost
  rrdsrv'.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>NOTE:</b> that there is no authentication with this feature! Do not setup
  such a port unless you are sure what you are doing.

For very big setups, updating thousands of RRD files often becomes a serious IO
  problem. If you run into such problems, you might want to take a look at
  rrdcached, a caching daemon for RRDtool which may help you lessen the stress
  on your disks.
