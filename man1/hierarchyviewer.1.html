The Hierarchy Viewer application allows you to debug and optimize your user
  interface. It provides a visual representation of the layout's View hierarchy
  (the Layout View) and a magnified inspector of the display (the Pixel Perfect
  View).
<div class="Pp"></div>
To get the Hierarchy Viewer started:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">1.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Connect your device or launch an emulator.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">2.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Launch Hierarchy Viewer from the shell or your desktop
      environment's menu.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">3.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">In the window that opens, you'll see a list of Devices.
      When a device is selected, a list of currently active Windows is displayed
      on the right. The &lt;Focused Window&gt; is the window currently in the
      foreground, and also the default window loaded if you do not select
      another.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">4.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Select the window that you'd like to inspect and click Load
      View Hierarchy. The Layout View will be loaded. You can then load the
      Pixel Perfect View by clicking the second icon at the bottom-left of the
      window.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you've navigated to a different window on the device, press Refresh Windows
  to refresh the list of available windows on the right.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Layout_View"><a class="selflink" href="#Layout_View">Layout
  View</a></h2>
The Layout View offers a look at the View layout and properties. It has three
  views:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    Tree View: a hierarchy diagram of the Views, on the left.
    Properties View: a list of the selected View's properties, on the top-right.
    Wire-frame View: a wire-frame drawing of the layout, on the bottom-right.
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Select a node in the Tree View to display the properties of that element in the
  Properties View. When a node is selected, the Wire-frame View also indicates
  the bounds of the element with a red rectangle. Double click a node in the
  tree (or select it, and click Display View) to open a new window with a
  rendering of that element.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The Layout View includes a couple other helpful features for debugging your
  layout: Invalidate and Request Layout. These buttons execute the respective
  View calls, <i>invalidate()</i> and <i>requestLayout()</i>, on the View
  element currently selected in the tree. Calling these methods on any View can
  be very useful when simultaneously running a debugger on your application.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The Tree View can be resized by adjusting the zoom slider, below the diagram.
  The number of View elements in the window is also given here. You should look
  for ways to minimize the number of Views. The fewer View elements there are in
  a window, the faster it will perform.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you interact with the device and change the focused View, the diagram will
  not automatically refresh. You must reload the Layout View by clicking Load
  View Hierarchy.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Pixel_Perfect_View"><a class="selflink" href="#Pixel_Perfect_View">Pixel
  Perfect View</a></h2>
The Pixel Perfect View provides a magnified look at the current device window.
  It has three views:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    Explorer View: shows the View hierarchy as a list, on the left.
    Normal View: a normal view of the device window, in the middle.
    Loupe View: a magnified, pixel-grid view of the device window, on the right.
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Click on an element in the Explorer View and a &quot;layout box&quot; will be
  drawn in the Normal View to indicate the layout position of that element. The
  layout box uses multiple rectangles, to indicate the normal bounds, the
  padding and the margin (as needed). The purple or green rectangle indicates
  the normal bounds of the element (the height and width). The inner white or
  black rectangle indicates the content bounds, when padding is present. A black
  or white rectangle outside the normal purple/green rectangle indicates any
  present margins. (There are two colors for each rectangle, in order to provide
  the best contrast based on the colors currently in the background.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
A very handy feature for designing your UI is the ability to overlay an image in
  the Normal and Loupe Views. For example, you might have a mock-up image of how
  you'd like to layout your interface. By selecting Load... from the controls in
  the Normal View, you can choose the image from your computer and it will be
  placed atop the preview. Your chosen image will anchor at the bottom left
  corner of the screen. You can then adjust the opacity of the overlay and begin
  fine-tuning your layout to match the mock-up.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The Normal View and Loupe View refresh at regular intervals (5 seconds by
  default), but the Explorer View does not. If you navigate away and focus on a
  different View, then you should refresh the Explorer's hierarchy by clicking
  Load View Hierarchy. This is even true when you're working in a window that
  holds multiple Views that are not always visible. If you do not, although the
  previews will refresh, clicking a View in the Explorer will not provide the
  proper layout box in the Normal View, because the hierarchy believes you are
  still focused on the prior View.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Optional controls include:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    Overlay: Load an overlay image onto the view and adjust its opacity.
    Refresh Rate: Adjust how often the Normal and Loupe View refresh their display.
    Zoom: Adjust the zoom level of the Loupe View.
