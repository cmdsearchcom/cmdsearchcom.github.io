<p>HIERARCHYVIEWER(1) Android SDK Tools
HIERARCHYVIEWER(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
hierarchyviewer - a tool to debug and optimize Android user
interface</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
hierarchyviewer</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The Hierarchy Viewer application allows you to debug and
optimize your user interface. It provides a visual
representation of the layout&rsquo;s View hierarchy (the
Layout View) and a <br>
magnified inspector of the display (the Pixel Perfect
View).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To get the Hierarchy Viewer
started:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. Connect your device or launch
an emulator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Launch Hierarchy Viewer from
the shell or your desktop environment&rsquo;s menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. In the window that opens,
you&rsquo;ll see a list of Devices. When a device is
selected, a list of currently active Windows is displayed on
the right. The &lt;Focused Window&gt; is the <br>
window currently in the foreground, and also the default
window loaded if you do not select another.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. Select the window that
you&rsquo;d like to inspect and click Load View Hierarchy.
The Layout View will be loaded. You can then load the Pixel
Perfect View by clicking the second <br>
icon at the bottom-left of the window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you&rsquo;ve navigated to a
different window on the device, press Refresh Windows to
refresh the list of available windows on the right.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Layout View <br>
The Layout View offers a look at the View layout and
properties. It has three views:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tree View: a hierarchy diagram
of the Views, on the left. <br>
Properties View: a list of the selected View&rsquo;s
properties, on the top-right. <br>
Wire-frame View: a wire-frame drawing of the layout, on the
bottom-right.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Select a node in the Tree View
to display the properties of that element in the Properties
View. When a node is selected, the Wire-frame View also
indicates the bounds of the <br>
element with a red rectangle. Double click a node in the
tree (or select it, and click Display View) to open a new
window with a rendering of that element.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Layout View includes a
couple other helpful features for debugging your layout:
Invalidate and Request Layout. These buttons execute the
respective View calls, invalidate() <br>
and requestLayout(), on the View element currently selected
in the tree. Calling these methods on any View can be very
useful when simultaneously running a debugger on your <br>
application.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Tree View can be resized by
adjusting the zoom slider, below the diagram. The number of
View elements in the window is also given here. You should
look for ways to minimize <br>
the number of Views. The fewer View elements there are in a
window, the faster it will perform.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you interact with the device
and change the focused View, the diagram will not
automatically refresh. You must reload the Layout View by
clicking Load View Hierarchy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pixel Perfect View <br>
The Pixel Perfect View provides a magnified look at the
current device window. It has three views:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Explorer View: shows the View
hierarchy as a list, on the left. <br>
Normal View: a normal view of the device window, in the
middle. <br>
Loupe View: a magnified, pixel-grid view of the device
window, on the right.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Click on an element in the
Explorer View and a &quot;layout box&quot; will be drawn in
the Normal View to indicate the layout position of that
element. The layout box uses multiple <br>
rectangles, to indicate the normal bounds, the padding and
the margin (as needed). The purple or green rectangle
indicates the normal bounds of the element (the height and
<br>
width). The inner white or black rectangle indicates the
content bounds, when padding is present. A black or white
rectangle outside the normal purple/green rectangle
indicates <br>
any present margins. (There are two colors for each
rectangle, in order to provide the best contrast based on
the colors currently in the background.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A very handy feature for
designing your UI is the ability to overlay an image in the
Normal and Loupe Views. For example, you might have a
mock-up image of how you&rsquo;d like to <br>
layout your interface. By selecting Load... from the
controls in the Normal View, you can choose the image from
your computer and it will be placed atop the preview. Your
chosen <br>
image will anchor at the bottom left corner of the screen.
You can then adjust the opacity of the overlay and begin
fine-tuning your layout to match the mock-up.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Normal View and Loupe View
refresh at regular intervals (5 seconds by default), but the
Explorer View does not. If you navigate away and focus on a
different View, then you <br>
should refresh the Explorer&rsquo;s hierarchy by clicking
Load View Hierarchy. This is even true when you&rsquo;re
working in a window that holds multiple Views that are not
always visible. <br>
If you do not, although the previews will refresh, clicking
a View in the Explorer will not provide the proper layout
box in the Normal View, because the hierarchy believes you
<br>
are still focused on the prior View.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Optional controls include:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Overlay: Load an overlay image
onto the view and adjust its opacity. <br>
Refresh Rate: Adjust how often the Normal and Loupe View
refresh their display. <br>
Zoom: Adjust the zoom level of the Loupe View.</p>
