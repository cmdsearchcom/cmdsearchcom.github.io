(See the OPTIONS section for alternate option syntax with
long option names.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Less is a program similar to more (1), but which allows
backward movement in the file as well as forward movement.
Also, less does not have to read the entire input file
before <br>
starting, so with large input files it starts up faster than
text editors like vi (1). Less uses termcap (or terminfo on
some systems), so it can run on a variety of terminals. <br>
There is even limited support for hardcopy terminals. (On a
hardcopy terminal, lines which should be printed at the top
of the screen are prefixed with a caret.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Commands are based on both more
and vi. Commands may be preceded by a decimal number, called
N in the descriptions below. The number is used by some
commands, as indicated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMANDS <br>
In the following descriptions, ^X means control-X. ESC
stands for the ESCAPE key; for example ESC-v means the two
character sequence &quot;ESCAPE&quot;, then
&quot;v&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">h or H Help: display a summary
of these commands. If you forget all the other commands,
remember this one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SPACE or ^V or f or ^F <br>
Scroll forward N lines, default one window (see option -z
below). If N is more than the screen size, only the final
screenful is displayed. Warning: some systems use ^V <br>
as a special literalization character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">z Like SPACE, but if N is
specified, it becomes the new window size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ESC-SPACE <br>
Like SPACE, but scrolls a full screenful, even if it reaches
end-of-file in the process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENTER or RETURN or ^N or e or ^E
or j or ^J <br>
Scroll forward N lines, default 1. The entire N lines are
displayed, even if N is more than the screen size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">d or ^D <br>
Scroll forward N lines, default one half of the screen size.
If N is specified, it becomes the new default for subsequent
d and u commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">b or ^B or ESC-v <br>
Scroll backward N lines, default one window (see option -z
below). If N is more than the screen size, only the final
screenful is displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">w Like ESC-v, but if N is
specified, it becomes the new window size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">y or ^Y or ^P or k or ^K <br>
Scroll backward N lines, default 1. The entire N lines are
displayed, even if N is more than the screen size. Warning:
some systems use ^Y as a special job control char&acirc;
<br>
acter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">u or ^U <br>
Scroll backward N lines, default one half of the screen
size. If N is specified, it becomes the new default for
subsequent d and u commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ESC-) or RIGHTARROW <br>
Scroll horizontally right N characters, default half the
screen width (see the -# option). If a number N is
specified, it becomes the default for future RIGHTARROW and
<br>
LEFTARROW commands. While the text is scrolled, it acts as
though the -S option (chop lines) were in effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ESC-( or LEFTARROW <br>
Scroll horizontally left N characters, default half the
screen width (see the -# option). If a number N is
specified, it becomes the default for future RIGHTARROW and
<br>
LEFTARROW commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">r or ^R or ^L <br>
Repaint the screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">R Repaint the screen, discarding
any buffered input. Useful if the file is changing while it
is being viewed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">F Scroll forward, and keep
trying to read when the end of file is reached. Normally
this command would be used when already at the end of the
file. It is a way to monitor <br>
the tail of a file which is growing while it is being
viewed. (The behavior is similar to the &quot;tail -f&quot;
command.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ESC-F Like F, but as soon as a
line is found which matches the last search pattern, the
terminal bell is rung and forward scrolling stops.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">g or &lt; or ESC-&lt; <br>
Go to line N in the file, default 1 (beginning of file).
(Warning: this may be slow if N is large.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">G or &gt; or ESC-&gt; <br>
Go to line N in the file, default the end of the file.
(Warning: this may be slow if N is large, or if N is not
specified and standard input, rather than a file, is being
<br>
read.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">p or % Go to a position N
percent into the file. N should be between 0 and 100, and
may contain a decimal point.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">P Go to the line containing byte
offset N in the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">{ If a left curly bracket
appears in the top line displayed on the screen, the {
command will go to the matching right curly bracket. The
matching right curly bracket is <br>
positioned on the bottom line of the screen. If there is
more than one left curly bracket on the top line, a number N
may be used to specify the N-th bracket on the line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">} If a right curly bracket
appears in the bottom line displayed on the screen, the }
command will go to the matching left curly bracket. The
matching left curly bracket is <br>
positioned on the top line of the screen. If there is more
than one right curly bracket on the top line, a number N may
be used to specify the N-th bracket on the line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">( Like {, but applies to
parentheses rather than curly brackets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">) Like }, but applies to
parentheses rather than curly brackets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[ Like {, but applies to square
brackets rather than curly brackets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">] Like }, but applies to square
brackets rather than curly brackets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ESC-^F Followed by two
characters, acts like {, but uses the two characters as open
and close brackets, respectively. For example, &quot;ESC ^F
&lt; &gt;&quot; could be used to go forward to <br>
the &gt; which matches the &lt; in the top displayed
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ESC-^B Followed by two
characters, acts like }, but uses the two characters as open
and close brackets, respectively. For example, &quot;ESC ^B
&lt; &gt;&quot; could be used to go backward to <br>
the &lt; which matches the &gt; in the bottom displayed
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">m Followed by any lowercase
letter, marks the current position with that letter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&rsquo; (Single quote.) Followed
by any lowercase letter, returns to the position which was
previously marked with that letter. Followed by another
single quote, returns to the <br>
position at which the last &quot;large&quot; movement
command was executed. Followed by a ^ or $, jumps to the
beginning or end of the file respectively. Marks are
preserved when <br>
a new file is examined, so the &rsquo; command can be used
to switch between input files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^X^X Same as single quote.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/pattern <br>
Search forward in the file for the N-th line containing the
pattern. N defaults to 1. The pattern is a regular
expression, as recognized by the regular expression <br>
library supplied by your system. The search starts at the
first line displayed (but see the -a and -j options, which
change this).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Certain characters are special
if entered at the beginning of the pattern; they modify the
type of search rather than become part of the pattern:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^N or ! <br>
Search for lines which do NOT match the pattern.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^E or * <br>
Search multiple files. That is, if the search reaches the
END of the current file without finding a match, the search
continues in the next file in the command <br>
line list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^F or @ <br>
Begin the search at the first line of the FIRST file in the
command line list, regardless of what is currently displayed
on the screen or the settings of the -a or <br>
-j options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^K Highlight any text which
matches the pattern on the current screen, but don&rsquo;t
move to the first match (KEEP current position).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^R Don&rsquo;t interpret regular
expression metacharacters; that is, do a simple textual
comparison.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">?pattern <br>
Search backward in the file for the N-th line containing the
pattern. The search starts at the line immediately before
the top line displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Certain characters are special
as in the / command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^N or ! <br>
Search for lines which do NOT match the pattern.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^E or * <br>
Search multiple files. That is, if the search reaches the
beginning of the current file without finding a match, the
search continues in the previous file in the <br>
command line list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^F or @ <br>
Begin the search at the last line of the last file in the
command line list, regardless of what is currently displayed
on the screen or the settings of the -a or -j <br>
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^K As in forward searches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^R As in forward searches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ESC-/pattern <br>
Same as &quot;/*&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ESC-?pattern <br>
Same as &quot;?*&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">n Repeat previous search, for
N-th line containing the last pattern. If the previous
search was modified by ^N, the search is made for the N-th
line NOT containing the pat&acirc; <br>
tern. If the previous search was modified by ^E, the search
continues in the next (or previous) file if not satisfied in
the current file. If the previous search was <br>
modified by ^R, the search is done without using regular
expressions. There is no effect if the previous search was
modified by ^F or ^K.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">N Repeat previous search, but in
the reverse direction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ESC-n Repeat previous search,
but crossing file boundaries. The effect is as if the
previous search were modified by *.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ESC-N Repeat previous search,
but in the reverse direction and crossing file
boundaries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ESC-u Undo search highlighting.
Turn off highlighting of strings matching the current search
pattern. If highlighting is already off because of a
previous ESC-u command, turn <br>
highlighting back on. Any search command will also turn
highlighting back on. (Highlighting can also be disabled by
toggling the -G option; in that case search commands <br>
do not turn highlighting back on.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&amp;pattern <br>
Display only lines which match the pattern; lines which do
not match the pattern are not displayed. If pattern is empty
(if you type &amp; immediately followed by ENTER), any <br>
filtering is turned off, and all lines are displayed. While
filtering is in effect, an ampersand is displayed at the
beginning of the prompt, as a reminder that some <br>
lines in the file may be hidden.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Certain characters are special
as in the / command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^N or ! <br>
Display only lines which do NOT match the pattern.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^R Don&rsquo;t interpret regular
expression metacharacters; that is, do a simple textual
comparison.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">:e [filename] <br>
Examine a new file. If the filename is missing, the
&quot;current&quot; file (see the :n and :p commands below)
from the list of files in the command line is re-examined. A
per&acirc; <br>
cent sign (%) in the filename is replaced by the name of the
current file. A pound sign (#) is replaced by the name of
the previously examined file. However, two consec&acirc;
<br>
utive percent signs are simply replaced with a single
percent sign. This allows you to enter a filename that
contains a percent sign in the name. Similarly, two
consecu&acirc; <br>
tive pound signs are replaced with a single pound sign. The
filename is inserted into the command line list of files so
that it can be seen by subsequent :n and :p com&acirc; <br>
mands. If the filename consists of several files, they are
all inserted into the list of files and the first one is
examined. If the filename contains one or more spa&acirc;
<br>
ces, the entire filename should be enclosed in double quotes
(also see the -&quot; option).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^X^V or E <br>
Same as :e. Warning: some systems use ^V as a special
literalization character. On such systems, you may not be
able to use ^V.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">:n Examine the next file (from
the list of files given in the command line). If a number N
is specified, the N-th next file is examined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">:p Examine the previous file in
the command line list. If a number N is specified, the N-th
previous file is examined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">:x Examine the first file in the
command line list. If a number N is specified, the N-th file
in the list is examined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">:d Remove the current file from
the list of files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">t Go to the next tag, if there
were more than one matches for the current tag. See the -t
option for more details about tags.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">T Go to the previous tag, if
there were more than one matches for the current tag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">= or ^G or :f <br>
Prints some information about the file being viewed,
including its name and the line number and byte offset of
the bottom line being displayed. If possible, it also <br>
prints the length of the file, the number of lines in the
file and the percent of the file above the last displayed
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Followed by one of the command
line option letters (see OPTIONS below), this will change
the setting of that option and print a message describing
the new setting. If a <br>
^P (CONTROL-P) is entered immediately after the dash, the
setting of the option is changed but no message is printed.
If the option letter has a numeric value (such as -b <br>
or -h), or a string value (such as -P or -t), a new value
may be entered after the option letter. If no new value is
entered, a message describing the current setting is <br>
printed and nothing is changed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-- Like the - command, but takes
a long option name (see OPTIONS below) rather than a single
option letter. You must press ENTER or RETURN after typing
the option name. A <br>
^P immediately after the second dash suppresses printing of
a message describing the new setting, as in the -
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-+ Followed by one of the
command line option letters this will reset the option to
its default setting and print a message describing the new
setting. (The &quot;-+X&quot; command <br>
does the same thing as &quot;-+X&quot; on the command line.)
This does not work for string-valued options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--+ Like the -+ command, but
takes a long option name rather than a single option
letter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-! Followed by one of the
command line option letters, this will reset the option to
the &quot;opposite&quot; of its default setting and print a
message describing the new setting. <br>
This does not work for numeric or string-valued options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--! Like the -! command, but
takes a long option name rather than a single option
letter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">_ (Underscore.) Followed by one
of the command line option letters, this will print a
message describing the current setting of that option. The
setting of the option is <br>
not changed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">__ (Double underscore.) Like the
_ (underscore) command, but takes a long option name rather
than a single option letter. You must press ENTER or RETURN
after typing the <br>
option name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+cmd Causes the specified cmd to
be executed each time a new file is examined. For example,
+G causes less to initially display each file starting at
the end rather than the <br>
beginning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">V Prints the version number of
less being run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">q or Q or :q or :Q or ZZ <br>
Exits less.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following four commands may
or may not be valid, depending on your particular
installation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">v Invokes an editor to edit the
current file being viewed. The editor is taken from the
environment variable VISUAL if defined, or EDITOR if VISUAL
is not defined, or <br>
defaults to &quot;vi&quot; if neither VISUAL nor EDITOR is
defined. See also the discussion of LESSEDIT under the
section on PROMPTS below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">! shell-command <br>
Invokes a shell to run the shell-command given. A percent
sign (%) in the command is replaced by the name of the
current file. A pound sign (#) is replaced by the name <br>
of the previously examined file. &quot;!!&quot; repeats the
last shell command. &quot;!&quot; with no shell command
simply invokes a shell. On Unix systems, the shell is taken
from the <br>
environment variable SHELL, or defaults to &quot;sh&quot;.
On MS-DOS and OS/2 systems, the shell is the normal command
processor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">| &lt;m&gt; shell-command <br>
&lt;m&gt; represents any mark letter. Pipes a section of the
input file to the given shell command. The section of the
file to be piped is between the first line on the cur&acirc;
<br>
rent screen and the position marked by the letter. &lt;m&gt;
may also be ^ or $ to indicate beginning or end of file
respectively. If &lt;m&gt; is . or newline, the current
screen <br>
is piped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">s filename <br>
Save the input to a file. This only works if the input is a
pipe, not an ordinary file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Command line options are described below. Most options may
be changed while less is running, via the &quot;-&quot;
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most options may be given in one
of two forms: either a dash followed by a single letter, or
two dashes followed by a long option name. A long option
name may be abbreviated as <br>
long as the abbreviation is unambiguous. For example,
--quit-at-eof may be abbreviated --quit, but not --qui,
since both --quit-at-eof and --quiet begin with --qui. Some
long <br>
option names are in uppercase, such as --QUIT-AT-EOF, as
distinct from --quit-at-eof. Such option names need only
have their first letter capitalized; the remainder of the
name <br>
may be in either case. For example, --Quit-at-eof is
equivalent to --QUIT-AT-EOF.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options are also taken from the
environment variable &quot;LESS&quot;. For example, to avoid
typing &quot;less -options ...&quot; each time less is
invoked, you might tell csh:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">setenv LESS
&quot;-options&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or if you use sh:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LESS=&quot;-options&quot;;
export LESS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On MS-DOS, you don&rsquo;t need
the quotes, but you should replace any percent signs in the
options string by double percent signs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The environment variable is
parsed before the command line, so command line options
override the LESS environment variable. If an option appears
in the LESS variable, it can be <br>
reset to its default value on the command line by beginning
the command line option with &quot;-+&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some options like -k or -D
require a string to follow the option letter. The string for
that option is considered to end when a dollar sign ($) is
found. For example, you can <br>
set two -D options on MS-DOS like this:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">LESS=&quot;Dn9.1$Ds4.1&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the --use-backslash option
appears earlier in the options, then a dollar sign or
backslash may be included literally in an option string by
preceding it with a backslash. If <br>
the --use-backslash option is not in effect, then
backslashes are not treated specially, and there is no way
to include a dollar sign in the option string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-? or --help <br>
This option displays a summary of the commands accepted by
less (the same as the h command). (Depending on how your
shell interprets the question mark, it may be neces&acirc;
<br>
sary to quote the question mark, thus: &quot;- <br>
-a or --search-skip-screen <br>
By default, forward searches start at the top of the
displayed screen and backwards searches start at the bottom
of the displayed screen (except for repeated searches <br>
invoked by the n or N commands, which start after or before
the &quot;target&quot; line respectively; see the -j option
for more about the target line). The -a option causes
for&acirc; <br>
ward searches to instead start at the bottom of the screen
and backward searches to start at the top of the screen,
thus skipping all lines displayed on the screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A or --SEARCH-SKIP-SCREEN <br>
Causes all forward searches (not just non-repeated searches)
to start just after the target line, and all backward
searches to start just before the target line. Thus, <br>
forward searches will skip part of the displayed screen
(from the first line up to and including the target line).
Similarly backwards searches will skip the displayed <br>
screen from the last line up to and including the target
line. This was the default behavior in less versions prior
to 441.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-bn or --buffers=n <br>
Specifies the amount of buffer space less will use for each
file, in units of kilobytes (1024 bytes). By default 64K of
buffer space is used for each file (unless the <br>
file is a pipe; see the -B option). The -b option specifies
instead that n kilobytes of buffer space should be used for
each file. If n is -1, buffer space is unlimited; <br>
that is, the entire file can be read into memory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B or --auto-buffers <br>
By default, when data is read from a pipe, buffers are
allocated automatically as needed. If a large amount of data
is read from the pipe, this can cause a large amount <br>
of memory to be allocated. The -B option disables this
automatic allocation of buffers for pipes, so that only 64K
(or the amount of space specified by the -b option) is <br>
used for the pipe. Warning: use of -B can result in
erroneous display, since only the most recently viewed part
of the piped data is kept in memory; any earlier data is
<br>
lost.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c or --clear-screen <br>
Causes full screen repaints to be painted from the top line
down. By default, full screen repaints are done by scrolling
from the bottom of the screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C or --CLEAR-SCREEN <br>
Same as -c, for compatibility with older versions of
less.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d or --dumb <br>
The -d option suppresses the error message normally
displayed if the terminal is dumb; that is, lacks some
important capability, such as the ability to clear the
screen or <br>
scroll backward. The -d option does not otherwise change the
behavior of less on a dumb terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Dxcolor or --color=xcolor <br>
[MS-DOS only] Sets the color of the text displayed. x is a
single character which selects the type of text whose color
is being set: n=normal, s=standout, d=bold, <br>
u=underlined, k=blink. color is a pair of numbers separated
by a period. The first number selects the foreground color
and the second selects the background color of the <br>
text. A single number N is the same as N.M, where M is the
normal background color.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e or --quit-at-eof <br>
Causes less to automatically exit the second time it reaches
end-of-file. By default, the only way to exit less is via
the &quot;q&quot; command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E or --QUIT-AT-EOF <br>
Causes less to automatically exit the first time it reaches
end-of-file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f or --force <br>
Forces non-regular files to be opened. (A non-regular file
is a directory or a device special file.) Also suppresses
the warning message when a binary file is opened. <br>
By default, less will refuse to open non-regular files. Note
that some operating systems will not allow directories to be
read, even if -f is set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F or --quit-if-one-screen <br>
Causes less to automatically exit if the entire file can be
displayed on the first screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g or --hilite-search <br>
Normally, less will highlight ALL strings which match the
last search command. The -g option changes this behavior to
highlight only the particular string which was found <br>
by the last search command. This can cause less to run
somewhat faster than the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-G or --HILITE-SEARCH <br>
The -G option suppresses all highlighting of strings found
by search commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--old-bot <br>
Reverts to the old bottom of screen behavior. This can be
sometimes desirable if the long lines are not wrapped
correctly when reaching the bottom of the termi&acirc; <br>
nal, while scrolling forward.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-hn or --max-back-scroll=n <br>
Specifies a maximum number of lines to scroll backward. If
it is necessary to scroll backward more than n lines, the
screen is repainted in a forward direction instead. <br>
(If the terminal does not have the ability to scroll
backward, -h0 is implied.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i or --ignore-case <br>
Causes searches to ignore case; that is, uppercase and
lowercase are considered identical. This option is ignored
if any uppercase letters appear in the search pattern; <br>
in other words, if a pattern contains uppercase letters,
then that search does not ignore case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I or --IGNORE-CASE <br>
Like -i, but searches ignore case even if the pattern
contains uppercase letters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-jn or --jump-target=n <br>
Specifies a line on the screen where the &quot;target&quot;
line is to be positioned. The target line is the line
specified by any command to search for a pattern, jump to a
line <br>
number, jump to a file percentage or jump to a tag. The
screen line may be specified by a number: the top line on
the screen is 1, the next is 2, and so on. The number <br>
may be negative to specify a line relative to the bottom of
the screen: the bottom line on the screen is -1, the second
to the bottom is -2, and so on. Alternately, the <br>
screen line may be specified as a fraction of the height of
the screen, starting with a decimal point: .5 is in the
middle of the screen, .3 is three tenths down from the <br>
first line, and so on. If the line is specified as a
fraction, the actual line number is recalculated if the
terminal window is resized, so that the target line remains
<br>
at the specified fraction of the screen height. If any form
of the -j option is used, forward searches begin at the line
immediately after the target line, and backward <br>
searches begin at the target line, unless changed by -a or
-A. For example, if &quot;-j4&quot; is used, the target line
is the fourth line on the screen, so forward searches begin
<br>
at the fifth line on the screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-J or --status-column <br>
Displays a status column at the left edge of the screen. The
status column shows the lines that matched the current
search. The status column is also used if the -w or <br>
-W option is in effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-kfilename or
--lesskey-file=filename <br>
Causes less to open and interpret the named file as a
lesskey (1) file. Multiple -k options may be specified. If
the LESSKEY or LESSKEY_SYSTEM environment variable is <br>
set, or if a lesskey file is found in a standard place (see
KEY BINDINGS), it is also used as a lesskey file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-K or --quit-on-intr <br>
Causes less to exit immediately (with status 2) when an
interrupt character (usually ^C) is typed. Normally, an
interrupt character causes less to stop whatever it is <br>
doing and return to its command prompt. Note that use of
this option makes it impossible to return to the command
prompt from the &quot;F&quot; command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L or --no-lessopen <br>
Ignore the LESSOPEN environment variable (see the INPUT
PREPROCESSOR section below). This option can be set from
within less, but it will apply only to files opened
sub&acirc; <br>
sequently, not to the file which is currently open.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m or --long-prompt <br>
Causes less to prompt verbosely (like more), with the
percent into the file. By default, less prompts with a
colon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M or --LONG-PROMPT <br>
Causes less to prompt even more verbosely than more.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n or --line-numbers <br>
Suppresses line numbers. The default (to use line numbers)
may cause less to run more slowly in some cases, especially
with a very large input file. Suppressing line <br>
numbers with the -n option will avoid this problem. Using
line numbers means: the line number will be displayed in the
verbose prompt and in the = command, and the v com&acirc;
<br>
mand will pass the current line number to the editor (see
also the discussion of LESSEDIT in PROMPTS below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N or --LINE-NUMBERS <br>
Causes a line number to be displayed at the beginning of
each line in the display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ofilename or
--log-file=filename <br>
Causes less to copy its input to the named file as it is
being viewed. This applies only when the input file is a
pipe, not an ordinary file. If the file already exists, <br>
less will ask for confirmation before overwriting it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Ofilename or
--LOG-FILE=filename <br>
The -O option is like -o, but it will overwrite an existing
file without asking for confirmation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no log file has been
specified, the -o and -O options can be used from within
less to specify a log file. Without a file name, they will
simply report the name of the <br>
log file. The &quot;s&quot; command is equivalent to
specifying -o from within less.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ppattern or --pattern=pattern
<br>
The -p option on the command line is equivalent to
specifying +/pattern; that is, it tells less to start at the
first occurrence of pattern in the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Pprompt or --prompt=prompt <br>
Provides a way to tailor the three prompt styles to your own
preference. This option would normally be put in the LESS
environment variable, rather than being typed in <br>
with each less command. Such an option must either be the
last option in the LESS variable, or be terminated by a
dollar sign. -Ps followed by a string changes the <br>
default (short) prompt to that string. -Pm changes the
medium (-m) prompt. -PM changes the long (-M) prompt. -Ph
changes the prompt for the help screen. -P= changes <br>
the message printed by the = command. -Pw changes the
message printed while waiting for data (in the F command).
All prompt strings consist of a sequence of letters and <br>
special escape sequences. See the section on PROMPTS for
more details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q or --quiet or --silent <br>
Causes moderately &quot;quiet&quot; operation: the terminal
bell is not rung if an attempt is made to scroll past the
end of the file or before the beginning of the file. If the
<br>
terminal has a &quot;visual bell&quot;, it is used instead.
The bell will be rung on certain other errors, such as
typing an invalid character. The default is to ring the
terminal <br>
bell in all such cases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Q or --QUIET or --SILENT <br>
Causes totally &quot;quiet&quot; operation: the terminal
bell is never rung.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r or --raw-control-chars <br>
Causes &quot;raw&quot; control characters to be displayed.
The default is to display control characters using the caret
notation; for example, a control-A (octal 001) is displayed
<br>
as &quot;^A&quot;. Warning: when the -r option is used, less
cannot keep track of the actual appearance of the screen
(since this depends on how the screen responds to each type
of <br>
control character). Thus, various display problems may
result, such as long lines being split in the wrong
place.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R or --RAW-CONTROL-CHARS <br>
Like -r, but only ANSI &quot;color&quot; escape sequences
are output in &quot;raw&quot; form. Unlike -r, the screen
appearance is maintained correctly in most cases. ANSI
&quot;color&quot; escape <br>
sequences are sequences of the form:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ESC [ ... m</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where the &quot;...&quot; is
zero or more color specification characters For the purpose
of keeping track of screen appearance, ANSI color escape
sequences are assumed to not move <br>
the cursor. You can make less think that characters other
than &quot;m&quot; can end ANSI color escape sequences by
setting the environment variable LESSANSIENDCHARS to the
list of <br>
characters which can end a color escape sequence. And you
can make less think that characters other than the standard
ones may appear between the ESC and the m by setting <br>
the environment variable LESSANSIMIDCHARS to the list of
characters which can appear.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s or --squeeze-blank-lines <br>
Causes consecutive blank lines to be squeezed into a single
blank line. This is useful when viewing nroff output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S or --chop-long-lines <br>
Causes lines longer than the screen width to be chopped
(truncated) rather than wrapped. That is, the portion of a
long line that does not fit in the screen width is not <br>
shown. The default is to wrap long lines; that is, display
the remainder on the next line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ttag or --tag=tag <br>
The -t option, followed immediately by a TAG, will edit the
file containing that tag. For this to work, tag information
must be available; for example, there may be a <br>
file in the current directory called &quot;tags&quot;, which
was previously built by ctags (1) or an equivalent command.
If the environment variable LESSGLOBALTAGS is set, it is
<br>
taken to be the name of a command compatible with global
(1), and that command is executed to find the tag. (See
http://www.gnu.org/software/global/global.html). The -t <br>
option may also be specified from within less (using the -
command) as a way of examining a new file. The command
&quot;:t&quot; is equivalent to specifying -t from within
less.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Ttagsfile or
--tag-file=tagsfile <br>
Specifies a tags file to be used instead of
&quot;tags&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u or --underline-special <br>
Causes backspaces and carriage returns to be treated as
printable characters; that is, they are sent to the terminal
when they appear in the input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U or --UNDERLINE-SPECIAL <br>
Causes backspaces, tabs and carriage returns to be treated
as control characters; that is, they are handled as
specified by the -r option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, if neither -u nor -U
is given, backspaces which appear adjacent to an underscore
character are treated specially: the underlined text is
displayed using the <br>
terminal&rsquo;s hardware underlining capability. Also,
backspaces which appear between two identical characters are
treated specially: the overstruck text is printed using the
<br>
terminal&rsquo;s hardware boldface capability. Other
backspaces are deleted, along with the preceding character.
Carriage returns immediately followed by a newline are <br>
deleted. Other carriage returns are handled as specified by
the -r option. Text which is overstruck or underlined can be
searched for if neither -u nor -U is in effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V or --version <br>
Displays the version number of less.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w or --hilite-unread <br>
Temporarily highlights the first &quot;new&quot; line after
a forward movement of a full page. The first &quot;new&quot;
line is the line immediately following the line previously
at the <br>
bottom of the screen. Also highlights the target line after
a g or p command. The highlight is removed at the next
command which causes movement. The entire line is <br>
highlighted, unless the -J option is in effect, in which
case only the status column is highlighted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-W or --HILITE-UNREAD <br>
Like -w, but temporarily highlights the first new line after
any forward movement command larger than one line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-xn,... or --tabs=n,... <br>
Sets tab stops. If only one n is specified, tab stops are
set at multiples of n. If multiple values separated by
commas are specified, tab stops are set at those posi&acirc;
<br>
tions, and then continue with the same spacing as the last
two. For example, -x9,17 will set tabs at positions 9, 17,
25, 33, etc. The default for n is 8.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X or --no-init <br>
Disables sending the termcap initialization and
deinitialization strings to the terminal. This is sometimes
desirable if the deinitialization string does something
unnec&acirc; <br>
essary, like clearing the screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-yn or --max-forw-scroll=n <br>
Specifies a maximum number of lines to scroll forward. If it
is necessary to scroll forward more than n lines, the screen
is repainted instead. The -c or -C option may <br>
be used to repaint from the top of the screen if desired. By
default, any forward movement causes scrolling.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-[z]n or --window=n <br>
Changes the default scrolling window size to n lines. The
default is one screenful. The z and w commands can also be
used to change the window size. The &quot;z&quot; may be
<br>
omitted for compatibility with some versions of more. If the
number n is negative, it indicates n lines less than the
current screen size. For example, if the screen is <br>
24 lines, -z-4 sets the scrolling window to 20 lines. If the
screen is resized to 40 lines, the scrolling window
automatically changes to 36 lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-&quot;cc or --quotes=cc <br>
Changes the filename quoting character. This may be
necessary if you are trying to name a file which contains
both spaces and quote characters. Followed by a single <br>
character, this changes the quote character to that
character. Filenames containing a space should then be
surrounded by that character rather than by double quotes.
<br>
Followed by two characters, changes the open quote to the
first character, and the close quote to the second
character. Filenames containing a space should then be
pre&acirc; <br>
ceded by the open quote character and followed by the close
quote character. Note that even after the quote characters
are changed, this option remains -&quot; (a dash fol&acirc;
<br>
lowed by a double quote).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-~ or --tilde <br>
Normally lines after end of file are displayed as a single
tilde (~). This option causes lines after end of file to be
displayed as blank lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-# or --shift <br>
Specifies the default number of positions to scroll
horizontally in the RIGHTARROW and LEFTARROW commands. If
the number specified is zero, it sets the default number of
<br>
positions to one half of the screen width. Alternately, the
number may be specified as a fraction of the width of the
screen, starting with a decimal point: .5 is half of <br>
the screen width, .3 is three tenths of the screen width,
and so on. If the number is specified as a fraction, the
actual number of scroll positions is recalculated if <br>
the terminal window is resized, so that the actual scroll
remains at the specified fraction of the screen width.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--follow-name <br>
Normally, if the input file is renamed while an F command is
executing, less will continue to display the contents of the
original file despite its name change. If --fol&acirc; <br>
low-name is specified, during an F command less will
periodically attempt to reopen the file by name. If the
reopen succeeds and the file is a different file from the
<br>
original (which means that a new file has been created with
the same name as the original (now renamed) file), less will
display the contents of that new file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-keypad <br>
Disables sending the keypad initialization and
deinitialization strings to the terminal. This is sometimes
useful if the keypad strings make the numeric keypad behave
in <br>
an undesirable manner.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--use-backslash <br>
This option changes the interpretations of options which
follow this one. After the --use-backslash option, any
backslash in an option string is removed and the following
<br>
character is taken literally. This allows a dollar sign to
be included in option strings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-- A command line argument of
&quot;--&quot; marks the end of option arguments. Any
arguments following this are interpreted as filenames. This
can be useful when viewing a file <br>
whose name begins with a &quot;-&quot; or &quot;+&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+ If a command line option
begins with +, the remainder of that option is taken to be
an initial command to less. For example, +G tells less to
start at the end of the file <br>
rather than the beginning, and +/xyz tells it to start at
the first occurrence of &quot;xyz&quot; in the file. As a
special case, +&lt;number&gt; acts like +&lt;number&gt;g;
that is, it starts <br>
the display at the specified line number (however, see the
caveat under the &quot;g&quot; command above). If the option
starts with ++, the initial command applies to every file
<br>
being viewed, not just the first one. The + command
described previously may also be used to set (or change) an
initial command for every file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LINE EDITING <br>
When entering command line at the bottom of the screen (for
example, a filename for the :e command, or the pattern for a
search command), certain keys can be used to manipulate <br>
the command line. Most commands have an alternate form in [
brackets ] which can be used if a key does not exist on a
particular keyboard. (Note that the forms beginning with
<br>
ESC do not work in some MS-DOS and Windows systems because
ESC is the line erase character.) Any of these special keys
may be entered literally by preceding it with the
&quot;lit&acirc; <br>
eral&quot; character, either ^V or ^A. A backslash itself
may also be entered literally by entering two
backslashes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LEFTARROW [ ESC-h ] <br>
Move the cursor one space to the left.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RIGHTARROW [ ESC-l ] <br>
Move the cursor one space to the right.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^LEFTARROW [ ESC-b or
ESC-LEFTARROW ] <br>
(That is, CONTROL and LEFTARROW simultaneously.) Move the
cursor one word to the left.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^RIGHTARROW [ ESC-w or
ESC-RIGHTARROW ] <br>
(That is, CONTROL and RIGHTARROW simultaneously.) Move the
cursor one word to the right.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOME [ ESC-0 ] <br>
Move the cursor to the beginning of the line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">END [ ESC-$ ] <br>
Move the cursor to the end of the line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BACKSPACE <br>
Delete the character to the left of the cursor, or cancel
the command if the command line is empty.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DELETE or [ ESC-x ] <br>
Delete the character under the cursor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^BACKSPACE [ ESC-BACKSPACE ]
<br>
(That is, CONTROL and BACKSPACE simultaneously.) Delete the
word to the left of the cursor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^DELETE [ ESC-X or ESC-DELETE ]
<br>
(That is, CONTROL and DELETE simultaneously.) Delete the
word under the cursor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UPARROW [ ESC-k ] <br>
Retrieve the previous command line. If you first enter some
text and then press UPARROW, it will retrieve the previous
command which begins with that text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DOWNARROW [ ESC-j ] <br>
Retrieve the next command line. If you first enter some text
and then press DOWNARROW, it will retrieve the next command
which begins with that text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TAB Complete the partial
filename to the left of the cursor. If it matches more than
one filename, the first match is entered into the command
line. Repeated TABs will cycle <br>
thru the other matching filenames. If the completed filename
is a directory, a &quot;/&quot; is appended to the filename.
(On MS-DOS systems, a &quot; <br>
variable LESSSEPARATOR can be used to specify a different
character to append to a directory name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BACKTAB [ ESC-TAB ] <br>
Like, TAB, but cycles in the reverse direction thru the
matching filenames.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^L Complete the partial filename
to the left of the cursor. If it matches more than one
filename, all matches are entered into the command line (if
they fit).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^U (Unix and OS/2) or ESC
(MS-DOS) <br>
Delete the entire command line, or cancel the command if the
command line is empty. If you have changed your line-kill
character in Unix to something other than ^U, that <br>
character is used instead of ^U.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^G Delete the entire command
line and return to the main prompt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KEY BINDINGS <br>
You may define your own less commands by using the program
lesskey (1) to create a lesskey file. This file specifies a
set of command keys and an action associated with each <br>
key. You may also use lesskey to change the line-editing
keys (see LINE EDITING), and to set environment variables.
If the environment variable LESSKEY is set, less uses that
<br>
as the name of the lesskey file. Otherwise, less looks in a
standard place for the lesskey file: On Unix systems, less
looks for a lesskey file called &quot;$HOME/.less&quot;. On
MS-DOS <br>
and Windows systems, less looks for a lesskey file called
&quot;$HOME/_less&quot;, and if it is not found there, then
looks for a lesskey file called &quot;_less&quot; in any
directory specified in <br>
the PATH environment variable. On OS/2 systems, less looks
for a lesskey file called &quot;$HOME/less.ini&quot;, and if
it is not found, then looks for a lesskey file called
&quot;less.ini&quot; in <br>
any directory specified in the INIT environment variable,
and if it not found there, then looks for a lesskey file
called &quot;less.ini&quot; in any directory specified in
the PATH envi&acirc; <br>
ronment variable. See the lesskey manual page for more
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A system-wide lesskey file may
also be set up to provide key bindings. If a key is defined
in both a local lesskey file and in the system-wide file,
key bindings in the local <br>
file take precedence over those in the system-wide file. If
the environment variable LESSKEY_SYSTEM is set, less uses
that as the name of the system-wide lesskey file.
Other&acirc; <br>
wise, less looks in a standard place for the system-wide
lesskey file: On Unix systems, the system-wide lesskey file
is /usr/local/etc/sysless. (However, if less was built with
<br>
a different sysconf directory than /usr/local/etc, that
directory is where the sysless file is found.) On MS-DOS and
Windows systems, the system-wide lesskey file is
c:_sys&acirc; <br>
less. On OS/2 systems, the system-wide lesskey file is
c:less.ini.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUT PREPROCESSOR <br>
You may define an &quot;input preprocessor&quot; for less.
Before less opens a file, it first gives your input
preprocessor a chance to modify the way the contents of the
file are dis&acirc; <br>
played. An input preprocessor is simply an executable
program (or shell script), which writes the contents of the
file to a different file, called the replacement file. The
<br>
contents of the replacement file are then displayed in place
of the contents of the original file. However, it will
appear to the user as if the original file is opened; that
<br>
is, less will display the original filename as the name of
the current file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An input preprocessor receives
one command line argument, the original filename, as entered
by the user. It should create the replacement file, and when
finished, print the name <br>
of the replacement file to its standard output. If the input
preprocessor does not output a replacement filename, less
uses the original file, as normal. The input preprocessor
<br>
is not called when viewing standard input. To set up an
input preprocessor, set the LESSOPEN environment variable to
a command line which will invoke your input preprocessor.
<br>
This command line should include one occurrence of the
string &quot;%s&quot;, which will be replaced by the
filename when the input preprocessor command is invoked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When less closes a file opened
in such a way, it will call another program, called the
input postprocessor, which may perform any desired clean-up
action (such as deleting the <br>
replacement file created by LESSOPEN). This program receives
two command line arguments, the original filename as entered
by the user, and the name of the replacement file. To <br>
set up an input postprocessor, set the LESSCLOSE environment
variable to a command line which will invoke your input
postprocessor. It may include two occurrences of the string
<br>
&quot;%s&quot;; the first is replaced with the original name
of the file and the second with the name of the replacement
file, which was output by LESSOPEN.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, on many Unix
systems, these two scripts will allow you to keep files in
compressed format, but still let less view them
directly:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lessopen.sh: <br>
#! /bin/sh <br>
case &quot;$1&quot; in <br>
*.Z) uncompress - <br>
if [ -s /tmp/less.$$ ]; then <br>
echo /tmp/less.$$ <br>
else <br>
rm -f /tmp/less.$$ <br>
fi <br>
;; <br>
esac</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lessclose.sh: <br>
#! /bin/sh <br>
rm $2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To use these scripts, put them
both where they can be executed and set
LESSOPEN=&quot;lessopen.sh %s&quot;, and
LESSCLOSE=&quot;lessclose.sh %s %s&quot;. More complex
LESSOPEN and LESSCLOSE scripts <br>
may be written to accept other types of compressed files,
and so on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is also possible to set up an
input preprocessor to pipe the file data directly to less,
rather than putting the data into a replacement file. This
avoids the need to decom&acirc; <br>
press the entire file before starting to view it. An input
preprocessor that works this way is called an input pipe. An
input pipe, instead of writing the name of a replacement
<br>
file on its standard output, writes the entire contents of
the replacement file on its standard output. If the input
pipe does not write any characters on its standard output,
<br>
then there is no replacement file and less uses the original
file, as normal. To use an input pipe, make the first
character in the LESSOPEN environment variable a vertical
bar <br>
(|) to signify that the input preprocessor is an input
pipe.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, on many Unix
systems, this script will work like the previous example
scripts:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lesspipe.sh: <br>

case &quot;$1&quot; in <br>
*.Z) uncompress -c $1 2&gt;/dev/null <br>
*) exit 1 <br>
;; <br>
esac <br>
exit $?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To use this script, put it where
it can be executed and set LESSOPEN=&quot;|lesspipe.sh
%s&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that a preprocessor cannot
output an empty file, since that is interpreted as meaning
there is no replacement, and the original file is used. To
avoid this, if LESSOPEN <br>
starts with two vertical bars, the exit status of the script
becomes meaningful. If the exit status is zero, the output
is considered to be replacement text, even if it empty. <br>
If the exit status is nonzero, any output is ignored and the
original file is used. For compatibility with previous
versions of less, if LESSOPEN starts with only one vertical
<br>
bar, the exit status of the preprocessor is ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When an input pipe is used, a
LESSCLOSE postprocessor can be used, but it is usually not
necessary since there is no replacement file to clean up. In
this case, the replacement <br>
file name passed to the LESSCLOSE postprocessor is
&quot;-&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For compatibility with previous
versions of less, the input preprocessor or pipe is not used
if less is viewing standard input. However, if the first
character of LESSOPEN is a <br>
dash (-), the input preprocessor is used on standard input
as well as other files. In this case, the dash is not
considered to be part of the preprocessor command. If
standard <br>
input is being viewed, the input preprocessor is passed a
file name consisting of a single dash. Similarly, if the
first two characters of LESSOPEN are vertical bar and dash
<br>
(|-) or two vertical bars and a dash (||-), the input pipe
is used on standard input as well as other files. Again, in
this case the dash is not considered to be part of the <br>
input pipe command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are used following files
to set up default preprocessor: <br>
/etc/profile.d/less.sh <br>
/etc/profile.d/less.csh <br>
These files set up /usr/bin/lesspipe.sh as a default filter.
An user defined filter can be specified in ~/.lessfilter.
This file should have an execute bit set and accept only
<br>
one parameter, which represents a filename. If the user
defined filter process the file, zero should be returned.
Otherwise ~/.lessfilter tries to handle the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NATIONAL CHARACTER SETS <br>
There are three types of characters in the input file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">normal characters <br>
can be displayed directly to the screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">control characters <br>
should not be displayed directly, but are expected to be
found in ordinary text files (such as backspace and
tab).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">binary characters <br>
should not be displayed directly and are not expected to be
found in text files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A &quot;character set&quot; is
simply a description of which characters are to be
considered normal, control, and binary. The LESSCHARSET
environment variable may be used to select a <br>
character set. Possible values for LESSCHARSET are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ascii BS, TAB, NL, CR, and
formfeed are control characters, all chars with values
between 32 and 126 are normal, and all others are
binary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">iso8859 <br>
Selects an ISO 8859 character set. This is the same as
ASCII, except characters between 160 and 255 are treated as
normal characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">latin1 Same as iso8859.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">latin9 Same as iso8859.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dos Selects a character set
appropriate for MS-DOS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ebcdic Selects an EBCDIC
character set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IBM-1047 <br>
Selects an EBCDIC character set used by OS/390 Unix
Services. This is the EBCDIC analogue of latin1. You get
similar results by setting either LESSCHARSET=IBM-1047 or
<br>
LC_CTYPE=en_US in your environment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">koi8-r Selects a Russian
character set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">next Selects a character set
appropriate for NeXT computers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">utf-8 Selects the UTF-8 encoding
of the ISO 10646 character set. UTF-8 is special in that it
supports multi-byte characters in the input file. It is the
only character set <br>
that supports multi-byte characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">windows <br>
Selects a character set appropriate for Microsoft Windows
(cp 1251).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In rare cases, it may be desired
to tailor less to use a character set other than the ones
definable by LESSCHARSET. In this case, the environment
variable LESSCHARDEF can be <br>
used to define a character set. It should be set to a string
where each character in the string represents one character
in the character set. The character &quot;.&quot; is used
for a <br>
normal character, &quot;c&quot; for control, and
&quot;b&quot; for binary. A decimal number may be used for
repetition. For example, &quot;bccc4b.&quot; would mean
character 0 is binary, 1, 2 and 3 are con&acirc; <br>
trol, 4, 5, 6 and 7 are binary, and 8 is normal. All
characters after the last are taken to be the same as the
last, so characters 9 through 255 would be normal. (This is
an <br>
example, and does not necessarily represent any real
character set.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This table shows the value of
LESSCHARDEF which is equivalent to each of the possible
values for LESSCHARSET:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ascii 8bcccbcc18b95.b <br>
dos 8bcccbcc12bc5b95.b. <br>
ebcdic 5bc6bcc7bcc41b.9b7.9b5.b..8b6.10b6.b9.7b <br>
9.8b8.17b3.3b9.7b9.8b8.6b10.b.b.b. <br>
IBM-1047 4cbcbc3b9cbccbccbb4c6bcc5b3cbbc4bc4bccbc <br>
191.b <br>
iso8859 8bcccbcc18b95.33b. <br>
koi8-r 8bcccbcc18b95.b128. <br>
latin1 8bcccbcc18b95.33b. <br>
next 8bcccbcc18b95.bb125.bb</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If neither LESSCHARSET nor
LESSCHARDEF is set, but any of the strings
&quot;UTF-8&quot;, &quot;UTF8&quot;, &quot;utf-8&quot; or
&quot;utf8&quot; is found in the LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE or LANG
environment variables, then the <br>
default character set is utf-8.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If that string is not found, but
your system supports the setlocale interface, less will use
setlocale to determine the character set. setlocale is
controlled by setting the <br>
LANG or LC_CTYPE environment variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, if the setlocale
interface is also not available, the default character set
is latin1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Control and binary characters
are displayed in standout (reverse video). Each such
character is displayed in caret notation if possible (e.g.
^A for control-A). Caret notation <br>
is used only if inverting the 0100 bit results in a normal
printable character. Otherwise, the character is displayed
as a hex number in angle brackets. This format can be <br>
changed by setting the LESSBINFMT environment variable.
LESSBINFMT may begin with a &quot;*&quot; and one character
to select the display attribute: &quot;*k&quot; is blinking,
&quot;*d&quot; is bold, &quot;*u&quot; <br>
is underlined, &quot;*s&quot; is standout, and
&quot;*n&quot; is normal. If LESSBINFMT does not begin with
a &quot;*&quot;, normal attribute is assumed. The remainder
of LESSBINFMT is a string which may <br>
include one printf-style escape sequence (a % followed by x,
X, o, d, etc.). For example, if LESSBINFMT is
&quot;*u[%x]&quot;, binary characters are displayed in
underlined hexadecimal <br>
surrounded by brackets. The default if no LESSBINFMT is
specified is &quot;*s&lt;%02X&gt;&quot;. Warning: the result
of expanding the character via LESSBINFMT must be less than
31 characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the character set is utf-8,
the LESSUTFBINFMT environment variable acts similarly to
LESSBINFMT but it applies to Unicode code points that were
successfully decoded but are <br>
unsuitable for display (e.g., unassigned code points). Its
default value is &quot;&lt;U+%04lX&gt;&quot;. Note that
LESSUTFBINFMT and LESSBINFMT share their display attribute
setting (&quot;*x&quot;) so <br>
specifying one will affect both; LESSUTFBINFMT is read after
LESSBINFMT so its setting, if any, will have priority.
Problematic octets in a UTF-8 file (octets of a truncated
<br>
sequence, octets of a complete but non-shortest form
sequence, illegal octets, and stray trailing octets) are
displayed individually using LESSBINFMT so as to facilitate
diagnos&acirc; <br>
tic of how the UTF-8 file is ill-formed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROMPTS <br>
The -P option allows you to tailor the prompt to your
preference. The string given to the -P option replaces the
specified prompt string. Certain characters in the string
are <br>
interpreted specially. The prompt mechanism is rather
complicated to provide flexibility, but the ordinary user
need not understand the details of constructing personalized
<br>
prompt strings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A percent sign followed by a
single character is expanded according to what the following
character is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%bX Replaced by the byte offset
into the current input file. The b is followed by a single
character (shown as X above) which specifies the line whose
byte offset is to be <br>
used. If the character is a &quot;t&quot;, the byte offset
of the top line in the display is used, an &quot;m&quot;
means use the middle line, a &quot;b&quot; means use the
bottom line, a &quot;B&quot; means <br>
use the line just after the bottom line, and a &quot;j&quot;
means use the &quot;target&quot; line, as specified by the
-j option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%B Replaced by the size of the
current input file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%c Replaced by the column number
of the text appearing in the first column of the screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%dX Replaced by the page number
of a line in the input file. The line to be used is
determined by the X, as with the %b option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%D Replaced by the number of
pages in the input file, or equivalently, the page number of
the last line in the input file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%E Replaced by the name of the
editor (from the VISUAL environment variable, or the EDITOR
environment variable if VISUAL is not defined). See the
discussion of the LESSEDIT <br>
feature below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%f Replaced by the name of the
current input file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%F Replaced by the last
component of the name of the current input file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%i Replaced by the index of the
current file in the list of input files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%lX Replaced by the line number
of a line in the input file. The line to be used is
determined by the X, as with the %b option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%L Replaced by the line number
of the last line in the input file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%m Replaced by the total number
of input files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%pX Replaced by the percent into
the current input file, based on byte offsets. The line used
is determined by the X as with the %b option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%PX Replaced by the percent into
the current input file, based on line numbers. The line used
is determined by the X as with the %b option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%s Same as %B.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%t Causes any trailing spaces to
be removed. Usually used at the end of the string, but may
appear anywhere.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%x Replaced by the name of the
next input file in the list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If any item is unknown (for
example, the file size if input is a pipe), a question mark
is printed instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The format of the prompt string
can be changed depending on certain conditions. A question
mark followed by a single character acts like an
&quot;IF&quot;: depending on the following <br>
character, a condition is evaluated. If the condition is
true, any characters following the question mark and
condition character, up to a period, are included in the
prompt. <br>
If the condition is false, such characters are not included.
A colon appearing between the question mark and the period
can be used to establish an &quot;ELSE&quot;: any characters
<br>
between the colon and the period are included in the string
if and only if the IF condition is false. Condition
characters (which follow a question mark) may be:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">?a True if any characters have
been included in the prompt so far.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">?bX True if the byte offset of
the specified line is known.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">?B True if the size of current
input file is known.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">?c True if the text is
horizontally shifted (%c is not zero).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">?dX True if the page number of
the specified line is known.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">?e True if at end-of-file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">?f True if there is an input
filename (that is, if input is not a pipe).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">?lX True if the line number of
the specified line is known.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">?L True if the line number of
the last line in the file is known.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">?m True if there is more than
one input file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">?n True if this is the first
prompt in a new input file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">?pX True if the percent into the
current input file, based on byte offsets, of the specified
line is known.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">?PX True if the percent into the
current input file, based on line numbers, of the specified
line is known.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">?s Same as &quot;?B&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">?x True if there is a next input
file (that is, if the current input file is not the last
one).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any characters other than the
special ones (question mark, colon, period, percent, and
backslash) become literally part of the prompt. Any of the
special characters may be <br>
included in the prompt literally by preceding it with a
backslash.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">?f%f:Standard input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This prompt prints the filename,
if known; otherwise the string &quot;Standard
input&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">?f%f .?ltLine %lt:?pt%pt:?btByte
%bt:-...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This prompt would print the
filename, if known. The filename is followed by the line
number, if known, otherwise the percent if known, otherwise
the byte offset if known. Oth&acirc; <br>
erwise, a dash is printed. Notice how each question mark has
a matching period, and how the % after the %pt is included
literally by escaping it with a backslash.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">?n?f%f .?m(file %i of %m)
..?e(END) ?x- Next %x..%t</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This prints the filename if this
is the first prompt in a file, followed by the &quot;file N
of N&quot; message if there is more than one input file.
Then, if we are at end-of-file, the <br>
string &quot;(END)&quot; is printed followed by the name of
the next file, if there is one. Finally, any trailing spaces
are truncated. This is the default prompt. For reference,
here <br>
are the defaults for the other two prompts (-m and -M
respectively). Each is broken into two lines here for
readability only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">?n?f%f .?m(file %i of %m)
..?e(END) ?x- Next %x.: <br>
?pB%pB:byte %bB?s/%s...%t</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">?f%f .?n?m(file %i of %m)
..?ltlines %lt-%lb?L/%L. : <br>
byte %bB?s/%s. .?e(END) ?x- Next %x.:?pB%pB..%t</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">And here is the default message
produced by the = command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">?f%f .?m(file %i of %m)
.?ltlines %lt-%lb?L/%L. . <br>
byte %bB?s/%s. ?e(END) :?pB%pB..%t</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The prompt expansion features
are also used for another purpose: if an environment
variable LESSEDIT is defined, it is used as the command to
be executed when the v command is <br>
invoked. The LESSEDIT string is expanded in the same way as
the prompt strings. The default value for LESSEDIT is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%E ?lm+%lm. %f</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that this expands to the
editor name, followed by a + and the line number, followed
by the file name. If your editor does not accept the
&quot;+linenumber&quot; syntax, or has other <br>
differences in invocation syntax, the LESSEDIT variable can
be changed to modify this default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SECURITY <br>
When the environment variable LESSSECURE is set to 1, less
runs in a &quot;secure&quot; mode. This means these features
are disabled:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">! the shell command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">| the pipe command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">:e the examine command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">v the editing command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">s -o log files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k use of lesskey files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t use of tags files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">metacharacters in filenames,
such as *</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">filename completion (TAB,
^L)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Less can also be compiled to be
permanently in &quot;secure&quot; mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMPATIBILITY WITH MORE <br>
If the environment variable LESS_IS_MORE is set to 1, or if
the program is invoked via a file link named
&quot;more&quot;, less behaves (mostly) in conformance with
the POSIX &quot;more&quot; com&acirc; <br>
mand specification. In this mode, less behaves differently
in these ways:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -e option works differently.
If the -e option is not set, less behaves as if the -E
option were set. If the -e option is set, less behaves as if
the -e and -F options were <br>
set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -m option works differently.
If the -m option is not set, the medium prompt is used, and
it is prefixed with the string &quot;--More--&quot;. If the
-m option is set, the short <br>
prompt is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -n option acts like the -z
option. The normal behavior of the -n option is unavailable
in this mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The parameter to the -p option
is taken to be a less command rather than a search
pattern.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The LESS environment variable is
ignored, and the MORE environment variable is used in its
place.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
Environment variables may be specified either in the system
environment as usual, or in a lesskey (1) file. If
environment variables are defined in more than one place,
vari&acirc; <br>
ables defined in a local lesskey file take precedence over
variables defined in the system environment, which take
precedence over variables defined in the system-wide lesskey
<br>
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COLUMNS <br>
Sets the number of columns on the screen. Takes precedence
over the number of columns specified by the TERM variable.
(But if you have a windowing system which supports <br>
TIOCGWINSZ or WIOCGETD, the window system&rsquo;s idea of
the screen size takes precedence over the LINES and COLUMNS
environment variables.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EDITOR The name of the editor
(used for the v command).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOME Name of the user&rsquo;s
home directory (used to find a lesskey file on Unix and OS/2
systems).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOMEDRIVE, HOMEPATH <br>
Concatenation of the HOMEDRIVE and HOMEPATH environment
variables is the name of the user&rsquo;s home directory if
the HOME variable is not set (only in the Windows

init directory (used to find a lesskey file on OS/2
systems).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LANG Language for determining
the character set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_CTYPE <br>

Characters which may end an ANSI color escape sequence
(default &quot;m&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LESSANSIMIDCHARS <br>
Characters which may appear between the ESC character and
the end character in an ANSI color escape sequence (default
&quot;0123456789;[?!&quot;&rsquo;#%()*+ &quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LESSBINFMT <br>
Format for displaying non-printable, non-control
characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LESSCHARDEF <br>
Defines a character set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LESSCHARSET <br>
Selects a predefined character set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LESSECHO <br>
Name of the lessecho program (default &quot;lessecho&quot;).
The lessecho program is needed to expand metacharacters,
such as * and ?, in filenames on Unix systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LESSEDIT <br>
Editor prototype string (used for the v command). See
discussion under PROMPTS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LESSGLOBALTAGS <br>
Name of the command used by the -t option to find global
tags. Normally should be set to &quot;global&quot; if your
system has the global (1) command. If not set, global tags
are <br>
not used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LESSHISTFILE <br>
Name of the history file used to remember search commands
and shell commands between invocations of less. If set to
&quot;-&quot; or &quot;/dev/null&quot;, a history file is
not used. The <br>
default is &quot;$HOME/.lesshst&quot; on Unix systems,
&quot;$HOME/_lesshst&quot; on DOS and Windows systems, or
&quot;$HOME/lesshst.ini&quot; or
&quot;$INIT/lesshst.ini&quot; on OS/2 systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LESSHISTSIZE <br>
The maximum number of commands to save in the history file.
The default is 100.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LESSKEY <br>
Name of the default lesskey(1) file.</p>

List of characters which are considered
&quot;metacharacters&quot; by the shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LESSMETAESCAPE <br>
Prefix which less will add before each metacharacter in a
command sent to the shell. If LESSMETAESCAPE is an empty
string, commands containing metacharacters will not be <br>
passed to the shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LESSOPEN <br>
Command line to invoke the (optional)
input-preprocessor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LESSSECURE <br>

Format for displaying non-printable Unicode code points.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LESS_IS_MORE <br>
Emulate the more (1) command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LINES Sets the number of lines
on the screen. Takes precedence over the number of lines
specified by the TERM variable. (But if you have a windowing
system which supports <br>
TIOCGWINSZ or WIOCGETD, the window system&rsquo;s idea of
