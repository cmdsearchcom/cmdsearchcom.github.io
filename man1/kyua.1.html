<p>KYUA(1) BSD General Commands Manual KYUA(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
kyua &acirc; Command-line interface to Kyua quality
assurance toolkit</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
kyua [--config file] [--logfile file] [--loglevel level]
[--variable name=value] command [command_options]
[command_arguments]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Kyua is a quality assurance toolkit: a package that provides
libraries to aid in the creation of test cases, and tools to
execute such test cases and generate reports of their <br>
results.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This manual page describes kyua
(note the lowercase), which is the command-line interface to
the Kyua package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are here because all you
want to know is how to run the tests in
/usr/libexec/kyua-cli/tests, you most likely want to read
the tests(7) manual page instead if your system <br>
provides one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As can be observed in the
synopsis, the interface of kyua implements a common
subcommand-based interface. The arguments to the tool
specify, in this order: a set of common options <br>
that all the commands accept, a required command name that
specifies what kyua should do, and a set of
possibly-optional command_options and command_arguments that
are specific to <br>
the chosen command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options supported by all
commands <br>
The following options are recognized by all the commands.
Keep in mind that these must always be specified before the
command name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--config path, -c path <br>
Specifies the configuration file to process, which must be
in the format described in kyua.conf(5). The special value
&acirc;none&acirc; explicitly disables the loading of any
configura&acirc; <br>
tion file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Defaults to ~/.kyua/kyua.conf if
it exists, otherwise to /etc/kyua/kyua.conf if it exists, or
else to &acirc;none&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--logfile path <br>
Specifies the location of the file to which kyua will log
run time events useful for postmortem debugging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default depends on different
environment variables as described in Logging, but typically
the file will be stored within the user&rsquo;s home
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--loglevel level <br>
Specifies the maximum logging level to record in the log
file. See Logging for more details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is
&acirc;info&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--variable name=value, -v
name=value <br>
Sets the name configuration variable to value. The values
set through this option have preference over the values set
in the configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The specified variable can
either be a builtin variable or a test-suite specific
variable. See kyua.conf(5) for more details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Available commands <br>
The following commands are generic and do not have any
relation to the execution of tests or the inspection of
their results:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">about Shows general program
information. See kyua-about(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">config Inspects the values of
the configuration variables. See kyua-config(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">db-exec Executes an arbitrary
SQL statement on a results file and prints the resulting
table. See kyua-db-exec(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">help Shows usage information.
See kyua-help(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following commands are used
to generate reports based on the data previously recorded in
a results file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">report Generates a plain-text
report. See kyua-report(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">report-html Generates an HTML
report. See kyua-report-html(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">report-junit Generates a JUnit
report. See kyua-report-junit(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following commands are used
to interact with a test suite:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">debug Executes a single test
case in a controlled environment for debugging purposes. See
kyua-debug(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list Lists test cases and their
metadata. See kyua-list(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">test Runs tests. See
kyua-test(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Logging <br>
kyua has a logging facility that collects all kinds of
events at run time. These events are always logged to a file
so that the log is available when it is most needed: right
<br>
after a non-reproducible problem happens. The only way to
disable logging is by sending the log to /dev/null.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The location of the log file can
be manually specified with the --logfile option, which
applies to all commands. If no file is explicitly specified,
the location of the log files <br>
is chosen in this order:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. ${HOME}/.kyua/logs/ if HOME
is defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. ${TMPDIR}/ if TMPDIR is
defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. /tmp/.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">And the default naming scheme of
the log files is:
&acirc;&lt;progname&gt;.&lt;timestamp&gt;.log&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The messages stored in the log
file have a level (or severity) attached to them. These
are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">error Fatal error messages. The
program generally terminates after these, either in a clean
manner or by crashing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">warning Non-fatal error
messages. These generally report a condition that must be
addressed but the application can continue to run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">info Informational messages.
These tell the user what the program was doing at a general
level of operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">debug Detailed informational
messages. These are often useful when debugging problems in
the application, as they contain lots of internal
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default log level is
&acirc;info&acirc; unless expicitly overriden with
--loglevel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The log file is a plain text
file containing one line per log record. The format of each
line is as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">timestamp entry_type pid
file:line: message</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">entry_type can be one of:
&acirc;E&acirc; for an error, &acirc;W&acirc; for a warning,
&acirc;I&acirc; for an informational message and
&acirc;D&acirc; for a debug message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bug reporting <br>
If you think you have encountered a bug in kyua, please take
the time to let the developers know about it. This will
ensure that the bug is addressed and potentially fixed in
the <br>
next Kyua release.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first step in reporting a
bug is to check if there already is a similar bug in the
database. You can check what issues are currently in the
database by going to:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">https://github.com/jmmv/kyua/issues/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If there is no existing issue
that describes an issue similar to the one you are
experiencing, you can open a new one by visiting:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">https://github.com/jmmv/kyua/issues/new/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When doing so, please include as
much detail as possible. Among other things, explain what
operating system and platform you are running kyua on, what
were you trying to do, what <br>
exact messages you saw on the screen, how did you expect the
program to behave, and any other details that you may find
relevant.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also, please include a copy of
the log file corresponding to the problem you are
experiencing. Unless you have changed the location of the
log files, you can most likely find them <br>
in ~/.kyua/logs/. If the problem is reproducible, it is good
idea to regenerate the log file with an increased log level
so as to provide more information. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ kyua --logfile=problem.log
--loglevel=debug [rest of the command line]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
The following variables are recognized and can be freely
tuned by the end user:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COLUMNS The width of the screen,
in number of characters. kyua uses this to wrap long lines.
If not present, the width of the screen is determined from
the terminal stdout is <br>
connected to, and, if the guessing fails, this defaults to
infinity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOME Path to the user&rsquo;s
home directory. kyua uses this location to determine paths
to configuration files and default log files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TMPDIR Path to the system-wide
temporary directory. kyua uses this location to place the
work directory of test cases, among other things.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default value of this
variable depends on the operating system. In general, it is
/tmp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following variables are also
recognized, but you should not need to set them during
normal operation. They are only provided to override the
value of built-in values, which is <br>
useful when testing kyua itself:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KYUA_CONFDIR Path to the
system-wide configuration files for kyua.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Defaults to /etc/kyua.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KYUA_DOCDIR Path to the location
of installed documentation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Defaults to
/usr/share/doc/kyua-cli.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KYUA_MISCDIR Path to the
location of the installed miscellaneous scripts and data
files provided by kyua.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Defaults to
/usr/share/kyua-cli/misc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KYUA_STOREDIR Path to the
location of the installed store support files; e.g. the
directory containing the SQL database schema.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Defaults to
/usr/share/kyua-cli/store.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KYUA_TESTERSDIR <br>
Path to the location of the installed testers; e.g. the
directory containing programs like plain_tester. Defaults to
/usr/libexec.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
~/.kyua/store/ <br>
Default location for the results files. See
kyua-results-files(7) for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~/.kyua/kyua.conf <br>
User-specific configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~/.kyua/logs/ <br>
Default location for the collected log files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/kyua/kyua.conf <br>
System-wide configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
kyua returns 0 on success, 1 on a controlled error condition
in the given subcommand, 2 on a general unexpected error and
3 on a usage error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The documentation of the
subcommands in the corresponding manual pages only details
the difference between a successful exit (0) and the
detection of a controlled error (1). Even <br>
though when those manual pages do not describe any other
exit statuses, codes above 1 can be returned.</p>
