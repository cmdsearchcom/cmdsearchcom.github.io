<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
tcpreplay-edit - Replay network traffic stored in pcap
files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
tcpreplay-edit [-flags] [-flag [value]] [--option-name[[=|
]value]] &lt;pcap_file(s)&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tcpreplay is a tool for
replaying network traffic from files saved with tcpdump or
other tools which write pcap(3) files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The basic operation of tcpreplay is to resend all packets
from the input file(s) at the speed at which they were
recorded, or a specified data rate, up to as fast as the
<br>
hardware is capable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Optionally, the traffic can be
split between two interfaces, written to files, filtered and
edited in various ways, providing the means to test
firewalls, NIDS and other network <br>
devices.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For more details, please see the
Tcpreplay Manual at: http://tcpreplay.appneta.com</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r string, --portmap=string <br>
Rewrite TCP/UDP ports. This option may appear up to 9999
times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specify a list of comma
delimited port mappingings consisting of colon delimited
port number pairs. Each colon delimited port pair consists
of the port to match followed <br>
by the port number to rewrite.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples: <br>
--portmap=80:8000 --portmap=8080:80 # 80-&gt;8000 and
8080-&gt;80 <br>
--portmap=8000,8080,88888:80 # 3 different ports become 80
<br>
--portmap=8000-8999:80 # ports 8000 to 8999 become 80</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s number, --seed=number <br>
Randomize src/dst IPv4/v6 addresses w/ given seed. This
option may appear up to 1 times. This option must not appear
in combination with any of the following options: <br>
fuzz-seed. This option takes an integer number as its
argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Causes the source and
destination IPv4/v6 addresses to be pseudo randomized but
still maintain client/server relationships. Since the
randomization is deterministic based <br>
on the seed, you can reuse the same seed value to recreate
the traffic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N string, --pnat=string <br>
Rewrite IPv4/v6 addresses using pseudo-NAT. This option may
appear up to 2 times. This option must not appear in
combination with any of the following options: srcipmap.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Takes a comma delimited series
of colon delimited CIDR netblock pairs. Each netblock pair
is evaluated in order against the IP addresses. If the IP
address in the packet <br>
matches the first netblock, it is rewritten using the second
netblock as a mask against the high order bits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IPv4 Example: <br>

--pnat=192.168.0.0/16:10.77.0.0/16,172.16.0.0/12:10.1.0.0/24
<br>
IPv6 Example: <br>

--pnat=[2001:db8::/32]:[dead::/16],[2001:db8::/32]:[::ffff:0:0/96]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S string, --srcipmap=string
<br>
Rewrite source IPv4/v6 addresses using pseudo-NAT. This
option may appear up to 1 times. This option must not appear
in combination with any of the following options: <br>
pnat.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Works just like the --pnat
option, but only affects the source IP addresses in the
IPv4/v6 header.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D string, --dstipmap=string
<br>
Rewrite destination IPv4/v6 addresses using pseudo-NAT. This
option may appear up to 1 times. This option must not appear
in combination with any of the following <br>
options: pnat.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Works just like the --pnat
option, but only affects the destination IP addresses in the
IPv4/v6 header.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e string, --endpoints=string
<br>
Rewrite IP addresses to be between two endpoints. This
option may appear up to 1 times. This option must appear in
combination with the following options: cachefile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Takes a pair of colon delimited
IPv4/v6 addresses which will be used to rewrite all traffic
to appear to be between the two IP addresses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IPv4 Example: <br>
--endpoints=172.16.0.1:172.16.0.2 <br>
IPv6 Example: <br>
--endpoints=[2001:db8::dead:beef]:[::ffff:0:0:ac:f:0:2]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b, --skipbroadcast <br>
Skip rewriting broadcast/multicast IPv4/v6 addresses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default --seed, --pnat and
--endpoints will rewrite broadcast and multicast IPv4/v6 and
MAC addresses. Setting this flag will keep
broadcast/multicast IPv4/v6 and <br>
MAC addresses from being rewritten.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C, --fixcsum <br>
Force recalculation of IPv4/TCP/UDP header checksums.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Causes each IPv4/v6 packet to
have their checksums recalculated and fixed. Automatically
enabled for packets modified with --seed, --pnat,
--endpoints or --fixlen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m number, --mtu=number <br>
Override default MTU length (1500 bytes). This option may
appear up to 1 times. This option takes an integer number as
its argument. The value of number is constrained <br>
to being: <br>
in the range 1 through MAXPACKET</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Override the default 1500 byte
MTU size for determining the maximum padding length
(--fixlen=pad) or when truncating (--mtu-trunc).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--mtu-trunc <br>
Truncate packets larger then specified MTU. This option may
appear up to 1 times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Similar to --fixlen, this option
will truncate data in packets from Layer 3 and above to be
no larger then the MTU.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E, --efcs <br>
Remove Ethernet checksums (FCS) from end of frames.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note, this option is pretty
dangerous! We do not actually check to see if a FCS actually
exists in the frame, we just blindly delete the last 4
bytes. Hence, you should <br>
only use this if you know know that your OS provides the FCS
when reading raw packets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ttl=string <br>
Modify the IPv4/v6 TTL/Hop Limit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Allows you to modify the TTL/Hop
Limit of all the IPv4/v6 packets. Specify a number to
hard-code the value or +/-value to increase or decrease by
the value provided (lim&acirc; <br>
ited to 1-255).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples: <br>
--ttl=10 <br>
--ttl=+7 <br>
--ttl=-64</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--tos=number <br>
Set the IPv4 TOS/DiffServ/ECN byte. This option may appear
up to 1 times. This option takes an integer number as its
argument. The value of number is constrained to <br>
being: <br>
in the range 0 through 255</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Allows you to override the TOS
(also known as DiffServ/ECN) value in IPv4.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--tclass=number <br>
Set the IPv6 Traffic Class byte. This option may appear up
to 1 times. This option takes an integer number as its
argument. The value of number is constrained to being: <br>
in the range 0 through 255</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Allows you to override the IPv6
Traffic Class field.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--flowlabel=number <br>
Set the IPv6 Flow Label. This option may appear up to 1
times. This option takes an integer number as its argument.
The value of number is constrained to being: <br>
in the range 0 through 1048575</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Allows you to override the 20bit
IPv6 Flow Label field. Has no effect on IPv4 packets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F string, --fixlen=string <br>
Pad or truncate packet data to match header length. This
option may appear up to 1 times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Packets may be truncated during
capture if the snaplen is smaller then the packet. This
option allows you to modify the packet to pad the packet
back out to the size <br>
stored in the IPv4/v6 header or rewrite the IP header total
length to reflect the stored packet length.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pad Truncated packets will be
padded out so that the packet length matches the IPv4 total
length</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">trunc Truncated packets will
have their IPv4 total length field rewritten to match the
actual packet length</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">del Delete the packet</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--fuzz-seed=number <br>
Fuzz 1 in X packets. Edit bytes, length, or emulate packet
drop. This option takes an integer number as its argument.
The value of number is constrained to being: <br>
greater than or equal to 0 <br>
The default number for this option is: <br>
0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This fuzzing was designed as to
test layer 7 protocols such as voip protocols. It modifies
randomly 1 out of X packets (where X = --fuzz-factor) in
order for stateful <br>
protocols to cover more of their code. The random fuzzing
actions focus on data start and end because it often is the
part of the data application protocols base their <br>
decisions on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Possible fuzzing actions list:
<br>
* drop packet <br>
* reduce packet size <br>
* edit packet Bytes: <br>
* Not all Bytes have the same probability of appearance in
real life. <br>
Replace with 0x00, 0xFF, or a random byte with equal
likelyhook <br>
* Not all Bytes have the same significance in a packet. <br>
Replace the start, the end, or the middle of the packet with
equal likelihood. <br>
* do nothing (7 out of 8 packets)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--fuzz-factor=number <br>
Set the Fuzz 1 in X packet ratio (default 1 in 8 packets).
This option must appear in combination with the following
options: fuzz-seed. This option takes an integer <br>
number as its argument. The value of number is constrained
to being: <br>
greater than or equal to 1 <br>
The default number for this option is: <br>
8</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sets the ratio of for
--fuzz-seed option. By default this value is 8, which means
1 in 8 packets are modified by fuzzing. Note that this ratio
is based on the random num&acirc; <br>
ber genereated by the supplied fuzz seed. Therefore by
default you cannot expect that exactly every eighth packet
will be modified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--skipl2broadcast <br>
Skip rewriting broadcast/multicast Layer 2 addresses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, editing Layer 2
addresses will rewrite broadcast and multicast MAC
addresses. Setting this flag will keep broadcast/multicast
MAC addresses from being rewrit&acirc; <br>
ten.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dlt=string <br>
Override output DLT encapsulation. This option may appear up
to 1 times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, no DLT (data link
type) conversion will be made. To change the DLT type of the
output pcap, select one of the following values:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">enet Ethernet aka DLT_EN10MB</p>

Override destination ethernet MAC addresses. This option may
appear up to 1 times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Takes a pair of comma
deliminated ethernet MAC addresses which will replace the
destination MAC address of outbound packets. The first MAC
address will be used for the <br>
server to client traffic and the optional second MAC address
will be used for the client to server traffic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example: <br>
--enet-dmac=00:12:13:14:15:16,00:22:33:44:55:66</p>

Preloads packets into RAM before sending.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option loads the specified
pcap(s) into RAM before starting to send in order to improve
replay performance while introducing a startup performance
hit. Preloading <br>
can be used with or without --loop. This option also
suppresses flow statistics collection for every iteration,
which can significantly reduce memory usage. Flow
statis&acirc; <br>
tics are predicted based on options supplied and statistics
collected from the first loop iteration.</p>

dualfile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you have a pcap file you
would like to use to send bi-directional traffic through a
device (firewall, router, IDS, etc) then using tcpprep you
can create a cachefile <br>
which tcpreplay will use to split the traffic across two
network interfaces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-2, --dualfile <br>
Replay two files at a time from a network tap. This option
may appear up to 1 times. This option must appear in
combination with the following options: intf2. This <br>
option must not appear in combination with any of the
following options: cachefile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you captured network traffic
using a network tap, then you can end up with two pcap
files- one for each direction. This option will replay these
two files at the same <br>
time, one on each interface and inter-mix them using the
timestamps in each.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i string, --intf1=string <br>
Client to server/RX/primary traffic output interface. This
option may appear up to 1 times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Required network interface used

usually client-to-server or inbound <br>
(RX) on khial virtual interfaces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I string, --intf2=string <br>
Server to client/TX/secondary traffic output interface. This
option may appear up to 1 times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Optional network interface used
to send traffic which is marked as &rsquo;secondary&rsquo;
via tcpprep. Secondary traffic is usually server-to-client
or outbound (TX) on khial vir&acirc; <br>
tual interfaces. Generally, it only makes sense to use this
option with --cachefile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--listnics <br>
List available network interfaces and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l number, --loop=number <br>
Loop through the capture file X times. This option may

greater than or equal to 0 <br>
The default number for this option is: <br>
1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--loopdelay-ms=number <br>
Delay between loops in milliseconds. This option must appear
in combination with the following options: loop. This option
takes an integer number as its argument. The <br>
value of number is constrained to being: <br>
greater than or equal to 0 <br>
The default number for this option is: <br>
0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--pktlen <br>
Override the snaplen and use the actual packet len. This
option may appear up to 1 times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, tcpreplay will send
packets based on the size of the &quot;snaplen&quot; stored
in the pcap file which is usually the correct thing to do.
However, occasionally, tools <br>
will store more bytes then told to. By specifying this
option, tcpreplay will ignore the snaplen field and instead
try to send packets based on the original packet <br>
length. Bad things may happen if you specify this
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L number, --limit=number <br>
Limit the number of packets to send. This option may appear
up to 1 times. This option takes an integer number as its
argument. The value of number is constrained to <br>
being: <br>
greater than or equal to 1 <br>
The default number for this option is: <br>
-1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, tcpreplay will send
all the packets. Alternatively, you can specify a maximum
number of packets to send.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--duration=number <br>
Limit the number of seconds to send. This option may appear
up to 1 times. This option takes an integer number as its
argument. The value of number is constrained to <br>
being: <br>
greater than or equal to 1 <br>
The default number for this option is: <br>
-1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, tcpreplay will send
all the packets. Alternatively, you can specify a maximum
number of seconds to transmit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x string, --multiplier=string
<br>
Modify replay speed to a given multiple. This option may
appear up to 1 times. This option must not appear in
combination with any of the following options: pps, mbps,
<br>
oneatatime, topspeed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specify a value to modify the
packet replay speed. Examples: <br>
2.0 will replay traffic at twice the speed captured <br>
0.7 will replay traffic at 70% the speed captured</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p string, --pps=string <br>
Replay packets at a given packets/sec. This option may
appear up to 1 times. This option must not appear in
combination with any of the following options: multiplier,
<br>
mbps, oneatatime, topspeed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specify a value to regulate the
packet replay to a specific packet-per-second rate.
Examples: <br>
200 will replay traffic at 200 packets per second <br>
0.25 will replay traffic at 15 packets per minute</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M string, --mbps=string <br>
Replay packets at a given Mbps. This option may appear up to
1 times. This option must not appear in combination with any
of the following options: multiplier, pps, <br>
oneatatime, topspeed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specify a floating point value
for the Mbps rate that tcpreplay should send packets at.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t, --topspeed <br>
Replay packets as fast as possible. This option must not
appear in combination with any of the following options:
mbps, multiplier, pps, oneatatime.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o, --oneatatime <br>
Replay one packet at a time for each user input. This option
must not appear in combination with any of the following
options: mbps, pps, multiplier, topspeed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Allows you to step through one
or more packets at a time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--pps-multi=number <br>
Number of packets to send for each time interval. This
option must appear in combination with the following
options: pps. This option takes an integer number as its
<br>
argument. The value of number is constrained to being: <br>
greater than or equal to 1 <br>
The default number for this option is: <br>
1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When trying to send packets at
very high rates, the time between each packet can be so
short that it is impossible to accurately sleep for the
required period of time. <br>
This option allows you to send multiple packets at a time,
thus allowing for longer sleep times which can be more
accurately implemented.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--unique-ip <br>
Modify IP addresses each loop iteration to generate unique
flows. This option must appear in combination with the
following options: loop. This option must not appear in <br>
combination with any of the following options: seed,
fuzz-seed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ensure IPv4 and IPv6 packets
will be unique for each --loop iteration. This is done in a
way that will not alter packet CRC, and therefore will
genrally not affect per&acirc; <br>
formance. This option will significantly increase the
flows/sec over generated over multiple loop iterations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--unique-ip-loops=string <br>
Number of times to loop before assigning new unique ip. This
option may appear up to 1 times. This option must appear in
combination with the following options: unique- <br>
ip.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Number of --loop iterations
before a new unique IP is assigned. Default is 1. Assumes
both --loop and --unique-ip.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--netmap <br>
Write packets directly to netmap enabled network
adapter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This feature will detect netmap
capable network drivers on Linux and BSD systems. If
detected, the network driver is bypassed for the execution
duration, and network buf&acirc; <br>
fers will be written to directly. This will allow you to
achieve full line rates on commodity network adapters,
similar to rates achieved by commercial network traffic <br>
generators. Note that bypassing the network driver will
disrupt other applications connected through the test
interface. See INSTALL for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This feature can also be enabled
by specifying an interface as
&rsquo;netmap:&lt;intf&gt;&rsquo; or
&rsquo;vale:&lt;intf&gt;. For example
&rsquo;netmap:eth0&rsquo; specifies netmap over interface
eth0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--nm-delay=number <br>
Netmap startup delay. This option takes an integer number as
its argument. The default number for this option is: <br>
10</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Number of seconds to delay after
netmap is loaded. Required to ensure interfaces are fully up
before netmap transmit. Requires netmap option. Default is
10 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-flow-stats <br>
Suppress printing and tracking flow count, rates and
expirations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Suppress the collection and
printing of flow statistics. This option may improve
performance when not using --preload-pcap option, otherwise
its only function is to sup&acirc; <br>
press printing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The flow feature will track and
print statistics of the flows being sent. A flow is loosely
defined as a unique combination of a 5-tuple, i.e. source
IP, destination IP, <br>
source port, destination port and protocol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If --loop is specified, the
flows from one iteration to the next will not be unique,
unless the packets are altered. Use --unique-ip or
tcpreplay-edit to alter packets <br>
between iterations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--flow-expiry=number <br>
Number of inactive seconds before a flow is considered
expired. This option must not appear in combination with any
of the following options: no-flow-stats. This option <br>
takes an integer number as its argument. The value of number
is constrained to being: <br>
greater than or equal to 0 <br>
The default number for this option is: <br>
0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option will track and
report flow expirations based on the flow idle times. The
timestamps within the pcap file are used to determine the
expiry, not the actual time&acirc; <br>
stamp of the packets are replayed. For example, a value of
30 suggests that if no traffic is seen on a flow for 30
seconds, any subsequent traffic would be considered a <br>
new flow, and thereby will increment the flows and flows per
second (fps) statistics.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option can be used to
optimize flow timeout settings for flow products. Setting
the timeout low may lead to flows being dropped when in fact
the flow is simply slow <br>
to respond. Configuring your flow timeouts too high may
increase resources required by your flow product.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that using this option
while replaying at higher than original speeds can lead to
inflated flows and fps counts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default is 0 (no expiry) and a
typical value is 30-120 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P, --pid <br>
Print the PID of tcpreplay at startup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--stats=number <br>
Print statistics every X seconds, or every loop if
&rsquo;0&rsquo;. This option takes an integer number as its
argument. The value of number is constrained to being: <br>
greater than or equal to 0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that timed delays are a
&quot;best effort&quot; and long delays between sending
packets may cause equally long delays between printing
statistics.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
Print version information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --less-help <br>
Display less usage information and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H, --help <br>
Display usage information and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-!, --more-help <br>
Pass the extended usage information through a pager.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--save-opts [=cfgfile] <br>
Save the option state to cfgfile. The default is the last
configuration file listed in the OPTION PRESETS section,
below. The command will exit after updating the config <br>
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--load-opts=cfgfile,
--no-load-opts <br>
Load options from cfgfile. The no-load-opts form will
disable the loading of earlier config/rc/ini files.
--no-load-opts is handled early, out of order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTION PRESETS <br>
Any option that is not marked as not presettable may be
preset by loading values from configuration (&quot;RC&quot;
or &quot;.INI&quot;) file(s). The homerc file is
&quot;$$/&quot;, unless that is a direc&acirc; <br>
tory. In that case, the file &quot;.tcpreplay-editrc&quot;
is searched for within that directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
See OPTION PRESETS for configuration files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
One of the following exit values will be returned:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 (EXIT_SUCCESS) <br>
Successful program execution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 (EXIT_FAILURE) <br>
The operation failed or the command syntax was not
valid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">66 (EX_NOINPUT) <br>
A specified configuration file could not be loaded.</p>
