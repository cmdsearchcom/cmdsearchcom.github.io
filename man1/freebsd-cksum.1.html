<p>CKSUM(1) BSD General Commands Manual CKSUM(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
cksum, sum &acirc; display file checksums and block
counts</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
cksum [-o 1 | 2 | 3] [file ...] <br>
sum [file ...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The cksum utility writes to the standard output three
whitespace separated fields for each input file. These
fields are a checksum CRC, the total number of octets in the
file and <br>
the file name. If no file name is specified, the standard
input is used and no file name is written.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The sum utility is identical to
the cksum utility, except that it defaults to using historic
algorithm 1, as described below. It is provided for
compatibility only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The options are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o Use historic algorithms
instead of the (superior) default one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Algorithm 1 is the algorithm
used by historic BSD systems as the sum(1) algorithm and by
historic AT&amp;T System V UNIX systems as the sum(1)
algorithm when using the -r <br>
option. This is a 16-bit checksum, with a right rotation
before each addition; overflow is discarded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Algorithm 2 is the algorithm
used by historic AT&amp;T System V UNIX systems as the
default sum(1) algorithm. This is a 32-bit checksum, and is
defined as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">s = sum of all bytes; <br>
r = s % 2^16 + (s % 2^32) / 2^16; <br>
cksum = (r % 2^16) + r / 2^16;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Algorithm 3 is what is commonly
called the &acirc;32bit CRC&acirc; algorithm. This is a
32-bit checksum.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Both algorithm 1 and 2 write to
the standard output the same fields as the default algorithm
except that the size of the file in bytes is replaced with
the size of the file <br>
in blocks. For historic reasons, the block size is 1024 for
algorithm 1 and 512 for algorithm 2. Partial blocks are
rounded up.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default CRC used is based on
the polynomial used for CRC error checking in the networking
standard ISO/IEC 8802-3:1989. The CRC checksum encoding is
defined by the generating <br>
polynomial:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">G(x) = x^32 + x^26 + x^23 + x^22
+ x^16 + x^12 + <br>
x^11 + x^10 + x^8 + x^7 + x^5 + x^4 + x^2 + x + 1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mathematically, the CRC value
corresponding to a given file is defined by the following
procedure:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The n bits to be evaluated are
considered to be the coefficients of a mod 2 polynomial M(x)
of degree n-1. These n bits are the bits from the file, with
the most significant <br>
bit being the most significant bit of the first octet of the
file and the last bit being the least significant bit of the
last octet, padded with zero bits (if necessary) to <br>
achieve an integral number of octets, followed by one or
more octets representing the length of the file as a binary
value, least significant octet first. The smallest
num&acirc; <br>
ber of octets capable of representing this integer are
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">M(x) is multiplied by x^32
(i.e., shifted left 32 bits) and divided by G(x) using mod 2
division, producing a remainder R(x) of degree &lt;= 31.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The coefficients of R(x) are
considered to be a 32-bit sequence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The bit sequence is complemented
and the result is the CRC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The cksum and sum utilities exit 0 on success, and &gt;0 if
an error occurs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
md5(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default calculation is
identical to that given in pseudo-code in the following ACM
article.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Dilip V. Sarwate,
&quot;Computation of Cyclic Redundancy Checks Via Table
Lookup&quot;, Communications of the ACM, August 1988.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STANDARDS <br>
The cksum utility is expected to conform to IEEE Std
1003.2-1992 (&acirc;POSIX.2&acirc;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY <br>
The cksum utility appeared in 4.4BSD.</p>
