<p>WATCH(1) User Commands WATCH(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
watch - execute a program periodically, showing output
fullscreen</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
watch [options] command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
watch runs command repeatedly, displaying its output and
errors (the first screenfull). This allows you to watch the
program output change over time. By default, the program is
<br>
run every 2 seconds. By default, watch will run until
interrupted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-d, --differences [permanent] <br>
Highlight the differences between successive updates. Option
will read optional argument that changes highlight to be
permanent, allowing to see what has changed at least <br>
once since first iteration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --interval seconds <br>
Specify update interval. The command will not allow quicker
than 0.1 second interval, in which the smaller values are
converted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, --precise <br>
Make watch attempt to run command every interval seconds.
Try it with ntptime and notice how the fractional seconds
stays (nearly) the same, as opposed to normal mode <br>
where they continuously increase.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t, --no-title <br>
Turn off the header showing the interval, command, and
current time at the top of the display, as well as the
following blank line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b, --beep <br>
Beep if command has a non-zero exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e, --errexit <br>
Freeze updates on command error, and exit after a key
press.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g, --chgexit <br>
Exit when the output of command changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --color <br>
Interpret ANSI color and style sequences.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x, --exec <br>
command is given to sh -c which means that you may need to
use extra quoting to get the desired effect. This with the
--exec option, which passes the command to exec(2) <br>
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Display help text and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --version <br>
Display version information and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE <br>
Note that POSIX option processing is used (i.e., option
processing stops at the first non-option argument). This
means that flags after command don&rsquo;t get interpreted
by watch <br>
itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
To watch for mail, you might do</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">watch -n 60 from</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To watch the contents of a
directory change, you could use</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">watch -d ls -l</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you&rsquo;re only interested
in files owned by user joe, you might use</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">watch -d &rsquo;ls -l | fgrep
joe&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To see the effects of quoting,
try these out</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">watch echo $$ <br>
watch echo &rsquo;$$&rsquo; <br>
watch echo
&quot;&rsquo;&quot;&rsquo;$$&rsquo;&quot;&rsquo;&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To see the effect of precision
time keeping, try adding -p to</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">watch -n 10 sleep 1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can watch for your
administrator to install the latest kernel with</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">watch uname -r</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(Note that -p isn&rsquo;t
guaranteed to work across reboots, especially in the face of
ntpdate or other bootup time-changing mechanisms)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Upon terminal resize, the screen will not be correctly
repainted until the next scheduled update. All --differences
highlighting is lost on that update as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Non-printing characters are
stripped from program output. Use &quot;cat -v&quot; as part
of the command pipeline if you want to see them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Combining Characters that are
supposed to display on the character at the last column on
the screen may display one column early, or they may not
display at all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Combining Characters never count
as different in --differences mode. Only the base character
counts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Blank lines directly after a
line which ends in the last column do not display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--precise mode doesn&rsquo;t yet
have advanced temporal distortion technology to compensate
for a command that takes more than interval seconds to
execute. watch also can get into a <br>
state where it rapid-fires as many executions of command as
it can to catch up from a previous executions running longer
than interval (for example, netstat taking ages on a DNS
<br>
lookup).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
0 Success. <br>
1 Various failures. <br>
2 Forking the process to watch failed. <br>
3 Replacing child process stdout with write side pipe
failed. <br>
4 Command execution failed. <br>
5 Closing child process write pipe failed. <br>
7 IPC pipe creation failed. <br>
8 Getting child process return value with waitpid(2) failed,
or command exited up on error. <br>
other The watch will propagate command exit status as child
exit status. AUTHORS <br>
The original watch was written by Tony Rems
&acirc;&uml;rembo@unisoft.com&acirc;&copy; in 1991, with
mods and corrections by Francois Pinard. It was reworked and
new features added by Mike Coleman <br>
&acirc;&uml;mkc@acm.org&acirc;&copy; in 1999. The beep,
exec, and error handling features were added by Morty Abzug
&acirc;&uml;morty@frakir.org&acirc;&copy; in 2008. On a not
so dark and stormy morning in March of 2003, <br>
Anthony DeRobertis
&acirc;&uml;asd@suespammers.org&acirc;&copy; got sick of his
watches that should update every minute eventually updating
many seconds after the minute started, and added microsecond
<br>
precision. Unicode support was added in 2009 by Jarrod Lowe
&acirc;&uml;procps@rrod.net&acirc;&copy;</p>
