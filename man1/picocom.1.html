<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
picocom - minimal dumb-terminal emulation program</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
picocom [ options ] device</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
As its name suggests, picocom(1) is a minimal dumb-terminal
emulation program. It is, in principle, very much like
minicom(1), only it&rsquo;s &quot;pico&quot; instead of
&quot;mini&quot;! It was de&acirc; <br>
signed to serve as a simple, manual, modem configuration,
testing, and debugging tool. It has also served (quite well)
as a low-tech serial communications program to allow
ac&acirc; <br>
cess to all types of devices that provide serial consoles.
It could also prove useful in many other similar tasks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When picocom starts it opens the
terminal (serial device) given as its non-option argument.
Unless the --noinit option is given, it configures the
device to the settings speci&acirc; <br>
fied by the option-arguments (or to some default settings),
and sets it to &quot;raw&quot; mode. If --noinit is given,
the initialization and configuration is skipped; the device
is just <br>
opened. Following this, picocom sets the standard-input and
standard-output to raw mode. Having done so, it goes in a
loop where it listens for input from stdin, or from the <br>
serial port. Input from the serial port is copied to the
standard output while input from the standard input is
copied to the serial port. Picocom also scans its input
stream <br>
for a user-specified control character, called the escape
character (being by default C-a). If the escape character is
seen, then instead of sending it to the serial-device, the
<br>
program enters &quot;command mode&quot; and waits for the
next character (which is called the &quot;function
character&quot;). Depending on the value of the function
character, picocom performs one <br>
of the operations described in the COMMANDS section
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMANDS <br>
Commands are given to picocom by first keying the espace
character which by default is C-a (see OPTIONS below for how
to change it), and then keying one of the function (command)
<br>
characters shown here.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">escape character <br>
Send the escape character to the serial port and return to
&quot;transparent&quot; mode. This means that if the escape
character (C-a, by default) is typed twice, the program
sends <br>
the escape character to the serial port, and remains in
transparent mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C-x Exit the program: if the
--noreset option was not given then the serial port is reset
to its original settings before exiting; if it was given the
serial port is not re&acirc; <br>
set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C-q Quit the program without
reseting the serial port, regardless of the --noreset
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C-p Pulse the DTR line. Lower it
for 1 sec, and then raise it again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C-t Toggle the DTR line. If DTR
is up, then lower it. If it is down, then raise it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C-backslash <br>
Generate a break sequence on the serial line. A break
sequence is usually generated by marking (driving to logical
one) the serial Tx line for an amount of time core&acirc;
<br>
sponding to several character durations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C-b Set baurdate. Prompts you to
enter a baudrate numerically (in bps) and configures the
serial port accordingly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C-u Baud up. Increase the
baud-rate. The list of baud-rates stepped-through by this
command is: 50, 75, 110, 134, 150, 200, 300, 600, 1200,
2400, 4800, 9600, 19200, 38400, <br>
57600, 115200. If HIGH_BAUD support is compiled-in, then the
following baud-rates are also added to the list: 230400,
460800, 500000, 576000, 921600, 1000000, 1152000, <br>
1500000, 2000000, 2500000, 3000000, 3500000, 4000000.
Depending on you system, any of the higher baud rates may be
missing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C-d Baud down. Decrease the
baud-rate. The list of baud-rates stepped-through by this
command is the same as for the &quot;baud-up&quot;
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C-f Cycle through flow-control
settings (RTS/CTS, XON/XOFF, none).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C-y Cycle through parity
settings (even, odd, none).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C-i Cycle through
databits-number settings (5, 6, 7, 8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C-j Cycle through
stopbits-number settings (1, 2).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C-c Toggle local-echo mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C-v Show program options (like
baud rate, data bits, etc) as well as the actual serial port
settings. Only the options and port settings that can be
modified online (through <br>
commands) are shown, not those that can only be set at the
command-line. See DISPLAY OF OPTIONS AND PORT SETTINGS for
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C-h or C-k <br>
Show help or show keys. Prints a short description of all
available function (command) keys.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C-s Send (upload) a file. See
SENDING AND RECEIVING FILES below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C-r Receive (download) a file.
See SENDING AND RECEIVING FILES below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After performing one of the
above operations, the program leaves the command mode and
enters transparent mode. Example: To increase the baud-rate
by two steps, you have to type:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C-a, C-u, C-a, C-u</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">assuming of-course that C-a is
the escape character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Picocom accepts the following command-line options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--baud | -b <br>
Defines the baud-rate to set the serial-port (terminal)
to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--flow | -f <br>
Defines the flow-control mode to set the serial-port to.
Must be one of: x for xon/xoff (software) mode, h for
hardware flow control (RTS/CTS), n for no flow control. <br>
(Default: n)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--parity | -y <br>
Defines the parity mode to set the serial-port to. Must be
one of: o for odd parity mode, e for even parity mode, n for
no parity mode. (Default: n)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--databits | -d <br>
Defines the number of data bits in every character. Must be
one of: 5, 6, 7, 8. (Default: 8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--stopbits | -p <br>
Defines the number of stop bits in every character. Must be
one of: 1, or 2. (Default: 1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--escape | -e <br>
Defines the character that will make picocom enter
command-mode (see description above). If x is given, then
C-x will make picocom enter command mode. (Default: a)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--echo | -c <br>
Enable local echo. Every character being read from the
terminal (standard input) is echoed to the terminal
(standard output) subject to the echo-mapping configuration
<br>
(see --emap option). (Default: Disabled)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--noinit | -i <br>
If given, picocom will not initialize, reset, or otherwise
meddle with the serial port at start-up. It will just open
it. This is useful, for example, for connecting <br>
picocom to already-connected modems, or already configured
ports without terminating the connection, or altering the
settings. If required, serial port parameters can <br>
then be adjusted at run-time by commands. (Default:
Disabled)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--noreset | -r <br>
If given, picocom will not reset the serial port when
exiting. It will just close the filedes and do nothing more.
This is useful, for example, for leaving modems con&acirc;
<br>
nected when exiting picocom. Regardless whether the
--noreset option is given, the user can exit picocom using
the &quot;Quit&quot; command (instead of &quot;Exit&quot;),
which never resets <br>
the serial port. If --noreset is given then &quot;Quit&quot;
and &quot;Exit&quot; behave essentially the same. (Default:
Disabled)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--nolock | -l <br>
If given, picocom will not attempt to lock the serial port
before opening it. Normally, depending on how it&rsquo;s
compiled, picocom attempts to get a UUCP-style lock-file
<br>
(e.g. &rsquo;/var/lock/LCK..ttyS0&rsquo;) before opening the
port, or attempts to lock the port device-node using
flock(2). Failing to do so, results in the program exiting
after <br>
emitting an error-message. It is possible that your picocom
binary is compiled without support for locking. In this case
the --nolock option is accepted, but has no ef&acirc; <br>
fect. (Default: Disabled)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--send-cmd | -s <br>
Specifies the external program (and any arguments to it)
that will be used for transmitting files. If the argument to
--send-cmd is the empty string (&rsquo;&rsquo;), the
send-file <br>
command is disabled. See SENDING AND RECEIVING FILES.
(Default: sz -vv)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--receive-cmd | -v <br>
Specifies the external program (and any arguments to it)
that will be used for receiving files. If the argument to
--receive-cmd is the empty string (&rsquo;&rsquo;), the
re&acirc; <br>
ceive-file command is disabled. See SENDING AND RECEIVING
FILES. (Default: rz -vv)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--imap Specifies the input
character map (i.e. special characters to be replaced when
read from the serial port). See INPUT, OUTPUT, AND ECHO
MAPPING. (Defaul: Empty)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--omap Specifies the output
character map (i.e. special characters to be replaced before
being written to serial port). See INPUT, OUTPUT, AND ECHO
MAPPING. (Defaul: Empty)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--emap Specifies the local-echo
character map (i.e. special characters to be replaced before
being echoed-back to the terminal, if local-echo is
enabled). See INPUT, OUTPUT, <br>
AND ECHO MAPPING. (Defaul: delbs,crcrlf)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help | -h <br>
Print a short help message describing the command-line
options. Picocom&rsquo;s version, ompile-time options, and
enabled features are also shown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DISPLAY OF OPTIONS AND PORT
SETTINGS <br>
The &quot;show program options&quot; command (C-v), as well
as the commands that change program options (C-b, C-u, C-d,
C-f, etc) print messages showing the current values (or the
new val&acirc; <br>
ues, if they were changed) for the respective options. If
picocom determines that an actual serial-port setting
differs from the current value of the respective option (for
<br>
whatever reason), then the value of the option is shown
followed by the value of the actual serial-port setting in
parenthesis. Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*** baud: 115200 (9600)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This means that a baud rate of
115200bps has been selected (from the command line, or using
commands that change the baudrate) but the serial-port is
actually operating at <br>
9600bps (the driver may not support the higher setting, and
has silently replaced it with a safe default, or the setting
may have been changed from outside picocom). If the
op&acirc; <br>
tion and the corresponding serial-port setting are the same,
only a single value is shown. Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*** baud: 9600</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This behavioir was intriduced in
picocom 2.0. Older releases displayed only the option
values, not the actual serial-port settings corresponding to
them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SENDING AND RECEIVING FILES <br>
Picocom can send and receive files over the serial port
using external programs that implement the respective
protocols. In Linux typical programs for this purpose
are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; rx(1) - receive
using the X-MODEM protocol</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; rb(1) - receive
using the Y-MODEM protocol</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; rz(1) - receive
using the Z-MODEM protocol</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; sx(1) - send
using the X-MODEM protocol</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; sb(1) - send
using the Y-MODEM protocol</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; sz(1) - send
using the Z-MODEM protocol</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; ascii-xfr(1) -
receive or transmit ASCII files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The name of, and the
command-line options to, the program to be used for
transmitting files are given by the --send-cmd option.
Similarly the program to receive files, and its <br>
argumets, are given by the --receive-cmd option. For
example, in order to start a picocom session that uses sz(1)
to transmit files, and rz(1) to receive files, you have to
say <br>
something like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">picocom --send-cmd &quot;sz
-vv&quot; --receive-cmd &quot;rz -vv&quot; ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the argument to the -send-cmd
option, or the argument to the --receive-cmd option is the
empty string, then the respective command is disabled. For
example, in order to dis&acirc; <br>
able both the &quot;send&quot; and the &quot;receive&quot;
commands you can invoke picocom like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">picocom --send-cmd
&rsquo;&rsquo; --receive-cmd &rsquo;&rsquo; ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A picocom session with both, the
send- and the receive-file commands disabled does not
fork(2) and does not run any external programs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">During the picocom session, if
you key the &quot;send&quot; or &quot;receive&quot; commands
(e.g. by pressing C-a, C-s, or C-a, C-r) you will be
prompted for a filename. At this prompt you can en&acirc;
<br>
ter one or more file-names, and any additional arguments to
the transmission or reception program. Command-line editing
and rudimentary pathname completion are available at this
<br>
prompt, if you have compiled picocom with support for the
linenoise library. Pressing C-c at this prompt will cancel
the file transfer command and return to normal picocom
oper&acirc; <br>
ation. After entering a filename (and / or additional
transmission or reception program arguments) and assuming
you have not canceled the operation by pressing C-c, picocom
will <br>
start the the external program as specified by the
--send-cmd, or --receive-cmd option, and with any filenames
and additional arguments you may have supplied. The standard
input <br>
and output of the external program will be connected to the
serial port. The standard error of the external program will
be connected to the terminal which---while the program <br>
is running---will revert to canonical mode. Pressing C-c
while the external program is running will prematurely
terminate it (assuming that the program itself does not
ignore <br>
SIGINT), and return control to picocom. Pressing C-c at any
other time, has no special effect; the character is normally
passed to the serial port.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUT, OUTPUT, AND ECHO MAPPING
<br>
Using the --imap, --omap, and --emap options you can make
picocom map (tranlate, replace) certain special characters
after being read from the serial port (with --imap), before
<br>
being written to the serial port (with --omap), and before
being locally echoed to the terminal (standard output) if
local echo is enabled (with --emap). These mapping options
<br>
take, each, a single argument which is a comma-separated
list of one or more of the following identifiers:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; crlf (map CR to
LF),</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; crcrlf (map CR
to CR + LF),</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; igncr (ignore
CR),</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; lfcr (map LF to
CR),</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; lfcrlf (map LF
to CR + LF),</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; ignlf (ignore
LF),</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; bsdel (map BS to
DEL),</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; delbs (map DEL
to BS)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example the command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">picocom --omap crlf,delbs --imap
inglf,bsdel --emap crcrlf ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Replace every CR
(carriage return, 0x0d) caracter with LF (line feed, 0x0a)
and every DEL (delete, 0x7f) character with BS (backspace,
0x08) before writing it to the serial <br>
port.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Ignore (not
write to the terminal) every LF character read from the
serial port, and replace every BS character read from the
serial port with DEL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Replace every CR
character with CR and LF when echoing to the terminal (if
local-echo is enabled).</p>
