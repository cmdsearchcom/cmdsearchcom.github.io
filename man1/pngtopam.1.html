<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pngtopam - convert a PNG image into a Netpbm image</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pngtopam [-verbose] [-alphapam | -alpha | -mix]
[-background=color] [-gamma=value] [-text=filename] [-time]
[-byrow] [pngfile]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Minimum unique abbreviation of
option is acceptable. You may use double hyphens instead of
single hyphen to denote options. You may use white space in
place of the equals sign <br>
to separate an option name from its value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This program is part of Netpbm(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pngtopam reads a PNG image
(Portable Network Graphics) as input and produces a Netpbm
image as output. The type of the output file depends on the
input file - if it&rsquo;s black &amp; <br>
white, pngtopam creates a PBM file. If it&rsquo;s grayscale,
pngtopam creates a PGM file. Otherwise, it creates a PPM
file. Except that with the -alphapam option, it always
creates <br>
a PAM file. That file has tuple type GRAYSCALE_ALPHA or
RGB_ALPHA depending on whether the input has color or
not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To convert in the other
direction, use pnmtopng or pamrgbatopng. The former is more
powerful in almost every way, except that only the latter
can recognize transparency informa&acirc; <br>
tion in a PAM file, as you might generate with pngtopam
-alphapam. To use pnmtopng with a PAM file with
transparency, you can separate out the transparency channel
with pamchan&acirc; <br>
nel and feed it to pnmtopng separately. But you may want to
use pngtopam -alpha instead of pngtopam -alphapam if
you&rsquo;re going to be converting back.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-verbose <br>
Display various information about the input PNG image and
the conversion process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want even more
information about the PNG image, use pngcheck (not part of
Netpbm).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-alphapam <br>
Produce a single output image containing the main image
(foreground) and the alpha channel or transparency mask.
This image is in the PAM format with tuple type of either
<br>
GRAYSCALE_ALPHA (which has a depth of 2 channels) or
RGB_ALPHA (which has a depth of 4 channels).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can specify only one of
-alphapam, -alpha, and -mix. With none of them, pngtopam
produces an image of the foreground of the input image and
discards transparency <br>
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that converting in the
other direction, the pamtopng converter won&rsquo;t
recognize the transparency information you generate with
-alphapam, but pamrgbatopng will.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option was new in Netpbm
10.44 (September 2008).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-alpha Output the alpha channel
or transparency mask of the image. The result is either a
PBM file or a PGM file, depending on whether different
levels of transparency appear.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pngtopam discards the main image
(the foreground).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can specify only one of
-alphapam, -alpha, and -mix. With none of them, pngtopam
produces an image of the foreground of the input image and
discards transparency <br>
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mix Compose the image with the
transparency or alpha mask against a background. The
background color is determined by the bKGD chunk in the PNG,
except that you can override <br>
it with -background. If the PNG has no bKGD chunk and you
don&rsquo;t specify -background, the background color is
white.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can specify only one of
-alphapam, -alpha, and -mix. With none of them, pngtopam
produces an image of the foreground of the input image and
discards transparency <br>
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-background=color <br>
This option specifies the background color with which to mix
the image when you specify -mix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">color is as described for the
argument of the ppm_parsecolor() library routine
&acirc;&uml;libppm.html#colorname&acirc;&copy; .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
-background=rgb:01/ff/80</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
-background=rgbi:1/255/128</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you don&rsquo;t specify
-background, the background color is what is specified in
the PNG image, and if the PNG doesn&rsquo;t specify
anything, white.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You cannot specify -background
unless you also specify -mix. Before Netpbm 10.27 (March
2005), you could specify -background without -mix and it was
just ignored. (This <br>
caused a usability problem).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-gamma=value <br>
Converts the image to a new display-gamma value. If a gAMA
chunk is present in the png-file, pngtopam uses the
specified image-gamma value. If not, pngtopam considers <br>
the image-gamma to be 1.0. Based on the image-gamma and the
display-gamma given with this option, pngtopam adjusts the
colors written to the pnm-file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Because the gammas of
uncompensated monitors are around 2.6, which results in an
image-gamma of 0.45, some typical situations are: when the
image-gamma is 0.45 (use -ver&acirc; <br>
bose to check) and the picture is too light, your system is
gamma-corrected, so convert with &rsquo;-gamma 1.0&rsquo;.
When no gAMA chunk is present or the image-gamma is 1.0, use
<br>
2.2 to make the picture lighter and 0.45 to make the picture
darker.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One oddity to be aware of when
using -gamma on an image with transparency: The PNG image
specifies that a certain color is transparent, i.e. every
pixel in the image of <br>
that color is transparent. But pngtopam interprets this as
applying to the gamma-corrected space, and there may be less
precision in that space than in the original, <br>
which means multiple uncorrected colors map to the same
corrected color. So imagine that the image contains 3 shades
of white and specifies that one of them is transpar&acirc;
<br>
ent. After gamma correction, those three shades are
indistinguishable, so pngtopam considers pixels of all three
shades to be transparent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this is not what you want,
don&rsquo;t use gamma. Instead, use pnmgamma on the
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-text=file <br>
Writes the tEXt and zTXt chunks to a file, in a format as
described in the pnmtopng user manual. These chunks contain
text comments or annotations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-time Prints the tIME chunk to
stderr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-byrow This option can make
pngtopam run faster or in environments where it would
otherwise fail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pngtopam has two ways to do the
conversion from PNG to PAM, using respectively two
facilities of the PNG library:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Whole Image <br>
Decode the entire image into memory at once, using
png_read_image(), then convert to PAM and output row by
row.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Row By Row <br>
Read, convert, and output one row at a time using
png_read_row().</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Whole Image is generally
preferable because the PNG library does more of the work,
which means it understands more of the PNG format
possibilities now and in the future. <br>
Also, if the PNG is interlaced, pngtopam does not know how
to assemble the rows in the right order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Row By Row uses far less memory,
which means with large images, it can run in environments
where Whole Image cannot and may also run faster. And
because Netpbm code does <br>
more of the work, it&rsquo;s possible that it can be more
flexible or at least give better diagnostic information if
there&rsquo;s something wrong with the PNG.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Netpbm native code may do
something correctly that the PNG library does incorrectly,
or vice versa.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In Netpbm, we stress function
over performance, so by default pngtopam uses Whole Image.
You can select Row By Row with -byrow if you want the speed
or resource require&acirc; <br>
ment improvement.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-byrow was new in Netpbm 10.54
(March 2010).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-orientraw <br>
A TIFF stream contains raster data which can be arranged in
the stream various ways. Most commonly, it is arranged by
rows, with the top row first, and the pixels left to <br>
right within each row, but many other orientations are
possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The common orientation is the
same on the Netpbm formats use, so tifftopnm can do its jobs
quite efficiently when the TIFF raster is oriented that
way.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">But if the TIFF raster is
oriented any other way, it can take a considerable amount of
processing for tifftopnm to convert it to Netpbm format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For information on the PNG
format, see http://schaik.com/png
&acirc;&uml;http://schaik.com/png&acirc;&copy; .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE <br>
A PNG image contains a lot of information that can&rsquo;t
be represented in Netpbm formats. Therefore, you lose
information when you convert to another format with
&quot;pngtopam | pnm&acirc; <br>
toxxx&quot;. If there is a specialized converter that
converts directly to the other format, e.g. ptot to convert
from PNG to TIFF, you&rsquo;ll get better results using
that.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LIMITATIONS <br>
There could be an option to include PNG comment chunks in
the output image as PNM comments instead of putting them in
a separate file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The program could be much
faster, with a bit of code optimizing. As with any Netpbm
program, speed always takes a back seat to quick present and
future development.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY <br>
pngtopam was new in Netpbm 10.44, as a replacement for
pngtopnm. The main improvement over pngtopnm was that it
could generate a PAM image with a transparency channel,
whereas <br>
with pngtopnm, you would have to extract the transparency
channel as a separate file, in a separate run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pngtopnm was new in Netpbm 8.1
(March 2000), the first big change to the package in
Netpbm&rsquo;s renaissance. It and pnmtopng were simply
copied from the pnmtopng package (1) <br>
by Greg Roelofs. Those were based on simpler reference
applications by Alexander Lehmann
&lt;alex@hal.rhein-main.de&gt; and Willem van Schaik
&lt;willem@schaik.com&gt; and distributed with <br>
their PNG library.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Nearly all of the code has
changed since it was copied from the pnmtopng package, most
of it just to improve maintainability.</p>
