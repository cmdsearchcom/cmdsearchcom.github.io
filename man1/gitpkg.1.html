<p>GITPKG(1) General Commands Manual GITPKG(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
gitpkg - export a Debian source package from nominated git
revisions</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
gitpkg branch [origbranch]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
If gitpkg is run in a git(1) repo with a single
&rsquo;branch&rsquo; specified, then it will do a
git-archive export of that branch to the DEB_DIR directory.
If the package is Debian native <br>
it will simply create a source package from it. If the
package has a Debian version, then an orig tarball will be
expected to already exist for it. If an orig tarball does
not <br>
already exist then what happens next depends on the value of
the gitpkg.create-fake-orig configuration option (described
below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If gitpkg is invoked with two
branches specified, then the first branch will be exported
as the unpacked complete source, while the second branch
will be exported for the <br>
orig.tar.gz. This allows all local changes to the source to
be recorded in the resulting diff.gz if a pristine upstream
branch exists in the repository. If an orig tarball <br>
already exists for the version at &rsquo;branch&rsquo; then
what happens next depends on the value of the
gitpkg.force-overwrite-orig configuration option (described
below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &rsquo;branch&rsquo; should
always have a debian/ dir and may be any tree-ish object
that is accepted by git-archive(1). The
&rsquo;origbranch&rsquo;, if supplied, should usually not
have a debian/ <br>
dir.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION OPTIONS <br>
Almost all gitpkg configuration is handled using
git-config(1) now. The following configuration options are
supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gitpkg.deb-dir <br>
May be set to override the default destination directory for
exported packages. Default is &rsquo;../deb-packages&rsquo;.
Available to hook scripts as DEB_DIR. This may be
overrid&acirc; <br>
den on the command line with the --deb-dir=path option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gitpkg.build-rootcmd <br>
May be set to override the default command used to get root
for package build operations. Default is
&rsquo;fakeroot&rsquo;. Available to hook scripts as
BUILD_ROOTCMD.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gitpkg.prebuild-target <br>
May be set to a target or targets from debian/rules which
will be called after the debian source tree is exported, but
before the source package is built. Some packages <br>
may use this to generate autoconf files or the like, which
should generally not be in the repo, but which should be in
the distributed package. The target is invoked us&acirc;
<br>
ing the BUILD_ROOTCMD. A common use for this hook would be
to call the package&rsquo;s &rsquo;clean&rsquo; target. This
hook is unset by default since gitpkg 0.18. Previous to that
it <br>
defaulted to the clean target. Available to hook scripts as
PREBUILD_TARGET.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gitpkg.orig-compressor <br>
May be set to override the default compression for an
exported package.orig.tar. Default is &rsquo;gzip&rsquo;.
For format 3.0 packages, valid values also include xz and
bzip2. <br>
Available to hook scripts as ORIG_COMPRESSOR.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gitpkg.orig-compress-level <br>
An optional compression level to use with
gitpkg.orig-compressor. 1 is usually the fastest and 9 is
usually the smallest, with the precise details of everything
between <br>
being up to the chosen compressor. Default is unset (which
will use whatever the compressor default is). Available to
hook scripts as ORIG_COMPRESS_LEVEL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gitpkg.deb-compressor <br>
May be set to override the default compression used by
dpkg-source(1) for exported packages. Default (if unset) is
to use whatever dpkg-source wants to use. For format <br>
3.0 packages, valid values also include xz and bzip2.
Available to hook scripts as DEB_COMPRESSOR.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gitpkg.deb-compress-level <br>
An optional compression level to use with
gitpkg.deb-compressor. 1 is usually the fastest and 9 is
usually the smallest, with the precise details of everything
between <br>
being up to the chosen compressor. Default is unset (which
will use whatever the dpkg-source default is, currently
&rsquo;9&rsquo;). Available to hook scripts as
DEB_COMPRESS_LEVEL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gitpkg.dpkg-source <br>
May be set to pass arbitrary options verbatim to
dpkg-source(1) when building the source package. Use with
caution and at your own risk. To pass multiple options to
dp&acirc; <br>
kg-source you must set this option multiple times (ie. using
git config --add for each option) due to the otherwise
amusing quoting requirements for options such as <br>
&quot;--format=3.0 (native)&quot;. Default is empty.
Available to hook scripts as the indexed array
DPKG_SOURCE_OPTS. Do not use this to set the dpkg-source(1)
-Z or -z options, <br>
they should instead be set using the deb-compressor and
deb-compress-level options respectively. This may be
overridden on the command line with the --dpkg-source=arg
op&acirc; <br>
tion, which likewise must be passed multiple times to set
multiple options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gitpkg.create-fake-orig <br>
Sometimes both upstream source and debian support really are
intermingled into a single branch of the repo but
you&rsquo;d still like to make a &rsquo;non-native&rsquo;
package from it. <br>
gitpkg can fake an orig tarball from such a tree out of
everything but the contents of the debian/ directory.
Setting this option to &rsquo;true&rsquo; makes that
behaviour the de&acirc; <br>
fault if a single treeish is passed to gitpkg and no
corresponding orig tarball is found. Setting this option to
&rsquo;false&rsquo; will make gitpkg fail, reporting an
error, if a <br>
single treeish is passed and no orig tarball with the
correct version already exists for it (and none was
retrieved by a hook script prior to it being needed). If
this <br>
option is unset then the user will be prompted for the
correct thing to do if this situation arises. Default is
unset. Available to hook scripts as CREATE_FAKE_ORIG.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gitpkg.force-overwrite-orig <br>
This option controls the behaviour of gitpkg if an
&rsquo;origbranch&rsquo; treeish is specified and the
corresponding orig.tar for the &rsquo;branch&rsquo; already
exists. If this is set to <br>
&rsquo;true&rsquo;, then the orig.tar will be overwritten
with the repo source (to reuse an existing orig.tar simply
call gitpkg with only the single debian &rsquo;branch&rsquo;
treeish you wish <br>
to export). If this is set to &rsquo;false&rsquo;, then it
is a hard error to attempt to export the upstream source
again when the orig.tar already exists, and gitpkg will
terminate <br>
and scold you if you try. If unset you will be prompted
about whether to overwrite it or not, and the build will
continue using whichever of the two you selected. De&acirc;
<br>
fault is unset. Available to hook scripts as
FORCE_OVERWRITE_ORIG.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gitpkg.keep-unpacked-source <br>
This option controls whether or not the unpacked source
directory is kept after the package export and exit hook
have successfully completed. If this is set to
&rsquo;true&rsquo;, <br>
the unpacked source will be retained. If set to
&rsquo;false&rsquo; or unset then that directory will be
removed as the final operation before gitpkg exits if all
prior operations <br>
completed successfully. Default is unset. Available to hook
scripts as KEEP_UNPACKED_SOURCE. This may be overridden on
the command line with the <br>
--keep-unpacked-source=bool option (where &rsquo;no&rsquo;
or &rsquo;false&rsquo; will not keep it, and any other
value, including nothing, will).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SCRIPT HOOKS <br>
User defined scripts can be invoked from a number of points
during the package build process. They are sourced into
gitpkg as bash shell snippets, in most cases in a subshell,
<br>
so they can read state variables and perform external
actions, but cannot alter the running configuration once a
build is in progress. If a hook returns with a non-zero
status, <br>
then gitpkg will be terminated. (Hooks that do terminate
gitpkg should take some care not to leave too much of a
mess, but also should leave enough clues intact for the user
to <br>
diagnose and fix whatever the problem was. Useful and
informative error messages should be barked to stderr before
exiting in this way.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hook scripts may be installed on
the host system outside of the repo tree, or sourced from
version controlled files in the repo itself. Both methods
have advantages and risks <br>
for different use cases. Hook scripts are activated by the
local admin, by setting each relevant git-config(1) option
with the path to the script to be executed. Paths may be
<br>
absolute or relative to the directory which that hook is
called from. If a hook is set, the script must exist when it
is called. Care should be taken to only enable them for <br>
use by trusted source trees when hooking into files in the
repo itself. Usually you should enable them on a per-repo
basis with git-config(1) rather than at a --global or
--sys&acirc; <br>
tem level.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A brief admonition against
getting hooked: <br>
You should avoid complicated in-package hook arrangements
becoming essential for exporting your package source. If you
need them to create a particular package correctly, and <br>
need strict version binding with the source being released,
and they aren&rsquo;t useful to any other package at all ...
then you&rsquo;re quite probably doing something, or several
things, <br>
quite wrong. Else you&rsquo;re in such deep shit working
around some broken build system that you don&rsquo;t need me
to tell you about it. Either way, local admin has to enable
your hooks <br>
before they can run, so if you want to be friendly to others
(and yourself), then keep the &rsquo;normal&rsquo; packaging
work strictly inside the usual package building tools, and
leave the <br>
gitpkg hooks free for other local admins to wrap whatever
automation it is they need around things. If a particular
version of the package source needs some particular actions
<br>
performed on it prior to the first source package build,
then the PREBUILD_TARGET option from above is most probably
what you want rather than one of these hooks. Other people
<br>
can use that again later without needing to have gitpkg
around. The aim is for this to Help You. For some values of
All Of You. So do be careful to avoid letting it screw
oth&acirc; <br>
er people over if the hook isn&rsquo;t called, and/or let
them know what they need to do instead if it isn&rsquo;t. Ok
then, there&rsquo;s the barb to watch out for, so back to
the point again:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hook points <br>
The available hook points are listed below in roughly the
order that they would usually be invoked:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gitpkg.package-config-hook <br>
This hook runs in the top level directory of the repo gitpkg
was invoked in, prior to any operations taking place, with
all git-config(1) sourced options available to it. <br>
No detailed information about the package itself is
available in the hook environment yet, not even its name or
version, only the tree-ish(es) that gitpkg was passed by
<br>
the user, but the hook may run its own self-checks based on
the current (possibly &rsquo;dirty&rsquo;) contents of the
working tree that gitpkg was invoked in.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This hook is able to modify the
gitpkg configuration variables for subsequent operations. It
can perform operations on the repo if needed, but since it
needs to be com&acirc; <br>
mitted to the repo before it will ever be called, that may
not be so useful here in practice. Basically, it can do
anything it pleases, it&rsquo;s just a shell script, nothing
<br>
else has really begun yet, and it has been sourced into the
topmost shell level of gitpkg.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Its operation is different from
the admin-config-hook in only one respect, the path to this
hook must be relative to the TLD of the repo, and the
revision of the file that <br>
will be sourced is checked out from the &rsquo;branch&rsquo;
tree-ish that gitpkg was requested to export. The file must
exist in that version at the path given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Available to hook scripts as
PACKAGE_CONFIG_HOOK.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gitpkg.admin-config-hook <br>
This hook is run after the package-config-hook returns, and
differs from it in operation only by reading a static file
from the current filesystem rather than extracting a <br>
version controlled one from the repo being exported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This can be used by the local
admin to override any package specific options, that may
have been set by the package-config-hook, with site specific
configuration. This is <br>
a policy control, not a security one. Security was all over
when you let the package-config-hook run, this just lets you
override it without having to fake up a new com&acirc; <br>
mit changing the package hook.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is the last hook to run
that is able to modify the gitpkg configuration and set
environment options that will be visible to later hooks.
Available to hook scripts as <br>
ADMIN_CONFIG_HOOK. This may be overridden on the command
line with the --admin-config-hook=path option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gitpkg.pre-export-hook <br>
This hook runs in the top level directory of the repo, after
the package name and version have been determined, and with
the final package configuration including any <br>
tweaking by the previous hooks. It cannot alter any
configuration options, only act upon them or terminate
gitpkg.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This can be used to do things
like invoke pristine-tar or prefetch an existing orig
tarball from some foreign source. It may perform operations
on the repo if any such <br>
are desired, or any other last minute check that needs to be
done before we actually get about the task of exporting the
source we want packaged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Available to hook scripts as
PRE_EXPORT_HOOK.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gitpkg.deb-export-hook <br>
This hook runs in the top level directory of the exported
debian source, immediately after the source has been
exported from the requested tree-ish, and immediately prior
<br>
to the PREBUILD_TARGET being invoked (if provided). It
cannot alter any configuration options, only act upon them
or terminate gitpkg. If this hook terminates gitpkg, <br>
the exported source directory will be left on the system for
the user to inspect. Subsequent invocations of gitpkg for
the same release version will overwrite it though. <br>
Available to hook scripts as DEB_EXPORT_HOOK.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gitpkg.orig-export-hook <br>
This hook runs in the top level directory of the exported
&rsquo;upstream&rsquo; source, immediately after the source
has been exported from the provided tree-ish, and prior to
it be&acirc; <br>
ing compressed into a tarball. It cannot alter any
configuration options, only act upon them or terminate
gitpkg. If this hook terminates gitpkg, the exported source
di&acirc; <br>
rectory will be left on the system for the user to inspect.
Subsequent invocations of gitpkg for the same release
version will overwrite it though.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This hook is only invoked if the
upstream &rsquo;origbranch&rsquo; actually is exported from
the repository. If an existing orig.tar is found or has been
created by some earlier hook <br>
(and it is not being overwritten, see force-overwrite-orig
above), then the operations this hook would perform are
presumed to have already happened for this tarball and <br>
it is skipped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is not safe to assume that
this hook will be executed before or after deb-export-hook,
and it may in fact be run in parallel with it at some point
in the future. They <br>
both will be entered after pre-export-hook returns, and
exit-hook will not begin until (at least) after both have
returned. What else happens in the middle of all that we
<br>
make no firm promises about at this stage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Available to hook scripts as
ORIG_EXPORT_HOOK.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gitpkg.exit-hook <br>
This hook runs in the directory where the package .dsc was
deposited by dpkg-source(1), after all internal gitpkg
operations have successfully completed. It&rsquo;s too late
to <br>
alter any configuration options, or even to terminate gitpkg
really. You can pretty much do what you like from this one,
anything that goes wrong from here on is your own <br>
doing. Available to hook scripts as EXIT_HOOK. This may be
overridden on the command line with the --exit-hook=path
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hook Environment <br>
The following variables are made available for hook scripts,
in addition to those already listed as shadowing a
git-config option from above. Not all of them are
valid/useful at <br>
all hook points, see the hook documentation above for the
exceptions applying to specific hooks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GITPKG_HOOK_API <br>
Permits hook scripts to query what interfaces are available
to them. Has only two numeric components separated by a
&rsquo;.&rsquo; of which the number to the right of point
will get <br>
incremented every time we add some new variable a hook might
access, or add some new knob it might tweak where existing
interfaces have not have changed. If we do screw <br>
up and need to change some current interface, the number to
the left will get bumped. The current API version is 0.2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Available in API version 0.1
<br>
These variables have been available to hooks since gitpkg
version 0.13</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GITPKG_TREEISH <br>
The user-passed debian &rsquo;branch&rsquo; tree-ish that
gitpkg was invoked to export.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GITPKG_ORIG_TREEISH <br>
The &rsquo;origbranch&rsquo; tree-ish that gitpkg was
invoked with. This will be empty if only a single
&rsquo;branch&rsquo; tree-ish was specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEB_SOURCE <br>
The name of the source package to create, without any
versioning. As seen in the Source: field of
dpkg-parsechangelog(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEB_VERSION <br>
The version of the source package to create, without any
epoch. As seen in the name of the .diff.gz and .dsc
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UPSTREAM_VERSION <br>
The version of the source package to create, without any
debian version. As seen in the name of the orig tarball. For
native packages this will be the same as DEB_VER&acirc; <br>
SION.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEB_ORIG <br>
The full versioned filename of the orig tarball to use or
create. This variable is empty for native packages without a
Debian version part.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEB_DSC <br>
The full filename of the package .dsc that will be or has
been created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEB_PACKAGE <br>
The directory name of the debianised source tree to pass to
dpkg-source(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REPO_DIR <br>
An absolute path to the top level directory of the git repo
we are exporting from. Usually, if you need to look out of
the tree that you were dropped in, you&rsquo;re probably
<br>
doing something (at the) wrong (time), but there are
exceptions, and being able to query git-config options is
one of them. That&rsquo;s mostly what this one is for right
now. <br>
See the repo-config-helper documented below. Be careful if
you do use it for much else.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Available in API version 0.2
<br>
These variables have been available to hooks since gitpkg
version 0.24</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GITPKG_AOPTS <br>
An associative array containing the command line options not
parsed by gitpkg itself which can be used to override the
behaviour of a hook. The array is keyed on the <br>
names of the options with the &rsquo;--&rsquo; removed. If
an option was passed multiple times, only the last value
passed will be stored in this array. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ gitpkg --my-option=foo
--option2 --opt=oops --opt=&rsquo;bar baz&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Will give:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">${GITPKG_AOPTS[my-option]} =
&quot;foo&quot; <br>
${GITPKG_AOPTS[option2]} = &quot;&quot; <br>
${GITPKG_AOPTS[opt]} = &quot;bar baz&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GITPKG_IOPTS <br>
An indexed array containing the command line options not
parsed by gitpkg itself which can be used to override the
behaviour of a hook. The array contains the literal
op&acirc; <br>
tion strings passed and so can be used to access options
which are intended to be passed multiple times. For
example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ gitpkg --my-option=foo
--option2 --opt=oops --opt=&rsquo;bar baz&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Will give:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">${GITPKG_IOPTS[0]} =
&quot;--my-option=foo&quot; <br>
${GITPKG_IOPTS[1]} = &quot;--option2&quot; <br>
${GITPKG_IOPTS[2]} = &quot;--opt=oops&quot; <br>
${GITPKG_IOPTS[3]} = &quot;--opt=bar baz&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The extract_values_for_option
function in repo-config-helper (see below for details of it)
can be used to further parse this array to obtain all the
value(s) for a specif&acirc; <br>
ic option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hook Library <br>
There are some canned hook scripts for various tasks
available in /usr/share/gitpkg/hooks which currently
include:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cowpoke-exit-hook <br>
A simple exit hook which sends the exported package off for
building using cowpoke(1). To enable it:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git config gitpkg.exit-hook
/usr/share/gitpkg/hooks/cowpoke-exit-hook</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Additional git-config(1)
configuration options:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">gitpkg-cowpoke-exit-hook.ask-first
<br>
If &rsquo;true&rsquo; prompt for confirmation before calling
cowpoke. Default is to just go ahead and do it.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">gitpkg-cowpoke-exit-hook.options
<br>
May include any other options to pass verbatim to cowpoke.
To pass multiple options, set this multiple times, once for
each option. This may be overridden on the <br>
command line with the --cowpoke=arg option, which likewise
must be passed multiple times to set multiple options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dpkg-buildpackage-exit-hook <br>
A simple exit hook to build binary packages locally with
dpkg-buildpackage(1). To enable it:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git config gitpkg.exit-hook
/usr/share/gitpkg/hooks/dpkg-buildpackage-exit-hook</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Additional git-config(1)
configuration options:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">gitpkg-dpkg-buildpackage-exit-hook.ask-first
<br>
If &rsquo;true&rsquo; prompt for confirmation before calling
dpkg-buildpackage. Default is to just do it.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">gitpkg-dpkg-buildpackage-exit-hook.options
<br>
May include any other options to pass verbatim to
dpkg-buildpackage. To pass multiple options, set this
multiple times, once for each option. This may be overridden
<br>
on the command line with the --dpkg-bp=arg option, which
likewise must be passed multiple times to set multiple
options.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">gitpkg-dpkg-buildpackage-exit-hook.build-log
<br>
If set &rsquo;false&rsquo; don&rsquo;t save a log of the
build process, the default is to record one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pristine-tar-pre-export-hook
<br>
A hook to extract an orig tarball using pristine-tar. Which
orig to extract is determined by the package version of the
&rsquo;branch&rsquo; tree-ish. To enable it:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git config
gitpkg.pre-export-hook
/usr/share/gitpkg/hooks/pristine-tar-pre-export-hook</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a pristine-tar branch is not
found in the repo, then gitpkg will be terminated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">quilt-patches-deb-export-hook
<br>
This hook reads a list of revision ranges suitable for
git-format-patch(1) from the file debian/source/git-patches,
one per line, and exports them to the debian/patches
di&acirc; <br>
rectory in a form suitable for (format 3.0) quilt packages.
It is not required for creating such packages, but permits
you to separate out individual patches however you <br>
please from the default single patch that is otherwise
created by dpkg-source.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To enable it:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git config
gitpkg.deb-export-hook
/usr/share/gitpkg/hooks/quilt-patches-deb-export-hook</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The contents of
debian/source/git-patches may include comments (on any line
beginning with a #), empty lines, and expressions of a range
of commits. The revision ranges may <br>
include $DEB_VERSION, $UPSTREAM_VERSION, $DEB_REF or
$UPSTREAM_REF. The first pair will be substituted with the
version of the package being exported, the second pair with
<br>
those version strings after mangling by sanitise_git_ref to
remap them to a legal git refname. Using the sanitised
versions is to be preferred in most cases. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Export all commits between
these two treeishes, <br>
# based on the version of the package being exported.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">upstream/$UPSTREAM_REF..patches/$DEB_REF</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">debcherry-deb-export-hook <br>
This hook invokes git-debcherry(1) to find and export
patches to the upstream source in a form suitable for use
with (format 3.0) quilt packages. It allows for a more
natu&acirc; <br>
ral (and automatic) workflow than the quilt-patches hook
above by searching for patches made to the packaging branch
that have not yet been applied upstream.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To enable it:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git config
gitpkg.deb-export-hook
/usr/share/gitpkg/hooks/debcherry-deb-export-hook</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to use this hook, a
${DEB_ORIG}.commit file must be created which contains the
treeish of the exported upstream source in the repository.
This will be created auto&acirc; <br>
matically (if this hook is enabled) when you export an
upstream tarball by passing both branch and origbranch to
gitpkg, or if you use the pristine-tar-pre-export-hook,
which <br>
determines an appropriate commit corresponding to the
tarball. If your upstream tarball is created using some
other mechanism you will need to ensure that file is created
<br>
yourself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If using this hook, you may wish
to document that in your repository with something similar
to the text in
/usr/share/doc/gitpkg/examples/README.debcherry-export as a
conve&acirc; <br>
nience to other users. Your package will still be exportable
without this hook enabled, it just won&rsquo;t have the
upstream patches individually separated out into a quilt
se&acirc; <br>
ries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hook Library Helpers <br>
These are even more trivial snippets, for operations which
may be shared by several scripts. Also found in
/usr/share/gitpkg/hooks. Usually these would be sourced by
other <br>
scripts rather than being hooked to directly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">repo-config-helper <br>
Provides a simple wrapper around &lsquo;git config&lsquo;,
which ensures it is called from the repo tree where any
repo-specific config options may be stored. Useful to
scripts which <br>
aren&rsquo;t called from inside the repo tree, but which do
have git-config options of their own to query.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Provides the sanitise_git_ref
shell function which remaps character strings that are
illegal to use in a git refname.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Provides the
extract_values_for_option shell function which can be used
to extract an array of the values for a particular option
from GITPKG_IOPTS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See the content of that file
itself for more detailed documentation on the functions that
it provides.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INTERACTIVIY <br>
If you intend to call gitpkg from your own scripts, then you
should note that there are two situations when it may prompt
interactively by default. There is no One True Sane
De&acirc; <br>
fault for these cases, so it&rsquo;s better to just ask the
user and continue than to make them start the whole process
again in the likely case where they have called gitpkg
directly. <br>
For details, see the gitpkg.force-overwrite-orig and
gitpkg.create-fake-orig config options above. You should set
both explicitly to the behaviour that you desire from them
if <br>
gitpkg should never become interactive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WORKFLOW <br>
Though gitpkg explicitly does not try to force any
particular workflow procedure upon you in order to make full
use of it, it probably is worth making quick mention of at
least <br>
one simple way to manage Debian packages in git.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One common repo structure is to
keep pristine upstream source on one branch, which is
updated either directly from an upstream repo or by
importing tar archives to it periodical&acirc; <br>
ly, with the Debian patched source on another branch. In
this situation the task of preparing a new upstream release
from a tarball might look a bit like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Check out the upstream branch
<br>
$ cd myrepo <br>
$ git checkout upstream</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Remove all old upstream files
from the repo <br>
$ rm -rf $(all_files_except .git)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unpack the new tarball in their
place <br>
$ tar zxf $new_upstream.tar.gz</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Let git figure out what is
renamed/new/gone by itself. <br>
Make sure you don&rsquo;t have things like vim .swp files
lurking <br>
in the tree still at this point. <br>
$ git add . <br>
$ git commit -a <br>
$ git tag v$upstream_version</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Prepare the Debian branch <br>
$ git checkout debian <br>
$ git merge upstream <br>
$ $(update changelog and other debian patches etc.) <br>
$ git commit -a <br>
$ git tag v${upstream_version}-$debian_version</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Make a release <br>
$ gitpkg v${upstream_version}-$debian_version
v$upstream_version <br>
$ cd ../deb-packages/mypackage &amp;&amp; dpkg-buildpackage
...</p>
