<p>HXINDEX(1) HTML-XML-utils HXINDEX(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
hxindex - insert an index into an HTML document</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
hxindex [-t] [-x] [-n] [-f] [-r] [-c class[,class...]] [-b
base] [-i indexdb] [-s template] [-u phrase] [-O
element[,element...]] [-X element[,element...]] [--]
[file-or-URL]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The hxindex looks for terms to be indexed in a document,
collects them, turns them into target anchors and creates a
sorted index as an HTML list, which is inserted at the place
<br>
of a placeholder in the document. The resulting document is
written to standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The index is inserted at the
place of a comment of the form</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;!--index--&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or between two comments of the
form</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;!--begin-index--&gt; <br>
... <br>
&lt;!--end-index--&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the latter case, all existing
content between the two comments is removed first.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Index terms are either elements
of type &lt;dfn&gt; or elements with a class attribute of
&quot;index&quot;. (For backward compatibility, also class
attributes &quot;index-inst&quot; and &quot;index-def&quot;
are <br>
recognized.) &lt;dfn&gt; elements (and class
&quot;index-def&quot;) are considered more important than
elements with class &quot;index&quot; and will appear in
bold in the generated index.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The option -c adds additional
classes, that are aliases for &quot;index&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, the contents of the
element are taken as the index term. Here are two examples
of occurrences of the index term &quot;shoe&quot;:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A &lt;dfn&gt;shoe&lt;/dfn&gt; is
a piece of clothing that... <br>
completed by a leather &lt;span
class=&quot;index&quot;&gt;shoe&lt;/span&gt;...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the term to be indexed is not
equal to the contents of the element, the title attribute
can be used to give the correct term:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">... &lt;dfn
title=&quot;shoe&quot;&gt;Shoes&lt;/dfn&gt; are pieces of
clothing that... <br>
... with two leather &lt;span class=&quot;index&quot;
title=&quot;shoe&quot;&gt;shoes&lt;/span&gt;...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The title attribute must also be
used when the index term is a subterm of another. Subterms
appear indented in the index, under their head term. To
define a subterm, use a title <br>
attribute with two exclamation marks (&quot;!!&quot;)
between the term and the subterm, like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;dfn
title=&quot;shoe!!leather&quot;&gt;...&lt;/dfn&gt; <br>
&lt;dfn title=&quot;shoe!!invention
of&quot;&gt;...&lt;/dfn&gt; <br>
&lt;em class=&quot;index&quot;
title=&quot;shoe!!protective!!steel
nosed&quot;&gt;...&lt;/em&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As the last example above shows,
there can be multiple levels of sub-subterms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The title attribute also allows
multiple index terms to be associated with a single
occurrence. The multiple terms are separated with a vertical
bar (&quot;|&quot;). Compare the following <br>
examples with the ones above:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;dfn
title=&quot;shoe|boot&quot;&gt;...&lt;/dfn&gt; <br>
&lt;dfn title=&quot;shoe!!invention
of|inventions!!shoe&quot;&gt;...&lt;/dfn&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These two elements both insert
two terms into the index. Note that the second example above
combines subterms and multiple terms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is possible to run index on a
file that already has an index. The old target anchors and
the old index will be removed before being re-generated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The following options are supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t By default, hxindex adds an
ID attribute to the element that contains the occurrence of
a term and also inserts an &lt;a&gt; element inside it with
a name attribute equal to <br>
the ID. This is to allow old browsers that ignore ID
attributes, such as Netscape 4, to find the target as well.
The -t option suppresses the &lt;a&gt; element.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x This option turns on XML
syntax conventions: empty elements will end in /&gt; instead
of &gt; as in HTML. -x implies -t.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i indexdb <br>
hxindex can read an initial index from a file and write the
merged collection of index terms back to that file. This
allows an index to span several documents. The -i <br>
option is used to give the name of the file that contains
the index.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b base This option is useful in
combination with -i to give the base URL reference of the
document. By default, hxindex will store links to
occurrences in the indexdb file in <br>
the form #anchor, but when -b is given, the links will look
like base#anchor instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When used in combination with
-n, the title attributes of the links will contain the title
of the document that contains the term. The title is
inserted before the tem&acirc; <br>
plate (see option -s) and separated from it with a comma and
a space. E.g., if hxindex is called with</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hxindex -i termdb -n -base
myfile.html myfile.html</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and the termdb already contains
an entry for &quot;foo&quot; in in section &quot;3.1&quot;
of a document called &quot;file2.html&quot; with title
&quot;The foos&quot;, then the generated index will contain
an <br>
entry such as this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">foo, &lt;a
href=&quot;file2.html#foo&quot; <br>
title=&quot;The foos, section 3.1&quot;&gt;3.1&lt;/a&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c class,class,... <br>
Normal index terms are recognized because they have a class
of &quot;index&quot;. The -c option adds additional,
comma-separated class names that will be considered aliases
for <br>
&quot;index&quot;. E.g., -c instance will make sure that
&lt;span class=&quot;instance&quot;&gt;term&lt;/span&gt; is
recognized as a term for the index.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n By default, the index
consists of links with &quot;#&quot; as the anchor text.
Option -n causes the link text to consist of the section
numbers of the sections in which the <br>
terms occur, falling back to &quot;without number&quot; (see
option -u below) if no section number could be found.
Section numbers are found by looking for the nearest
preceding <br>
start tag with a class of &quot;secno&quot; or
&quot;no-num&quot;. In the case of &quot;secno&quot;, the
contents of that element are taken as the section number. In
the case of &quot;no-num&quot; the section <br>
is assumed to have no number and hxindex will print
&quot;without number&quot; instead. These classes are also
used by hxnum(1), so it is useful to run hxindex after
hxnum, e.g.,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hxnum myfile.html | hxindex -n
&gt;mynewfile.html</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s template <br>
When option -n is used, the link will have a title attribute
and the template determines what it contains. The default is
&quot;section %s&quot;, where the %s is a placeholder <br>
for the section number. In other words, the index will
contain entries like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">term, &lt;a
href=&quot;#term&quot; title=&quot;section
7.8&quot;&gt;7.8&lt;/a&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hxindex -n -s &rsquo;chapter
%s&rsquo; <br>
hxindex -n -s &rsquo;part %s&rsquo; <br>
hxindex -n -s &rsquo;hoofdstuk %s&rsquo; -u &rsquo;zonder
nummer&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is only useful in
combination with -n</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u phrase When option -n is used
to display section numbers, references for which no section
number can be found are shown as phrase instead. The default
is &quot;??&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is only useful in
combination with -n</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Remove title attributes that
were used for the index as well as the comments that delimit
the inserted index. This avoids that browsers display these
attributes. Note <br>
that hxindex cannot be run again on its own output if this
option is used. (Mnemonic: &quot;freeze&quot; or
&quot;final&quot;.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Do not ignore trailing
punctuation when sorting index terms. E.g., if two terms are
written as</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;dfn&gt;foo,&lt;/dfn&gt;...
&lt;span class=index&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hxindex will normally ignore the
comma and treat them as the same term, but with -r, they are
treated as different. This affects trailing commas (,),
semicolons (;), <br>
colons (:), exclamations mark (!), question marks (?) and
full stops (.). A final full stop is never ignored if there
are two or more in the term, to protect abbrevia&acirc; <br>
tions (&quot;B.C.&quot;) and ellipsis (&quot;more...&quot;).
This does not affect how the index term is printed (it is
always printed as it appears in the text), only how it is
compared to <br>
similar terms. (Mnemonic: &quot;raw&quot;.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O element,element,... <br>
If -O is present, only elements with the given names will be
indexed. E.g.,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hxindex -O span,i,em</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">means that hxindex will only
look for class=&quot;index&quot; (and other classes,
according to -c) on the elements span, i and em. The
argument of -O must be a comma-separated <br>
list of element names. Note that this does not affect the
element dfn. It will always be indexed as a defining
instance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X element,element,... <br>
The option -X excludes the given elements from being
indexed. E.g.,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hxindex -X ul,ol</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">makes sure that ul and ol
elements are not indexed, even if they have a
class=&quot;index&quot; attribute. This does not exclude
their children from being indexed. E.g.,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;ul class=index&gt; <br>
&lt;li class=index&gt;foo <br>
&lt;li class=index&gt;bar <br>
&lt;li&gt;baz <br>
&lt;/ul&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will add foo and bar to the
index, but not the whole content of the ul element (foo bar
baz). If both -O and -X are given and an element occurs in
both options, it <br>
will be excluded. E.g.,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hxindex -X p,h1,ul -O
em,span,h1,h2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will cause hxindex to only look
for class attributes on em, span and h2, because h1 is
excluded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERANDS <br>
The following operand is supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file-or-URL <br>
The name of an HTML or XML file or the URL of one. If
absent, or if the file is &quot;-&quot;, standard input is
read instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The following exit values are returned:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 Successful completion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt;0 An error occurred in
parsing the HTML file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
The input is assumed to be in UTF-8, but the current locale
is used to determine the sorting order of the index terms.
I.e., hxindex looks at the LANG, LC_ALL and/or LC_COLLATE
<br>
environment variables. See locale(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To use a proxy to retrieve
remote files, set the environment variables http_proxy or
ftp_proxy. E.g.,
http_proxy=&quot;http://localhost:8080/&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Assumes UTF-8 as input. Doesn&rsquo;t expand character
entities (apart from the standard ones:
&quot;&amp;amp;&quot;, &quot;&amp;lt;&quot;,
&quot;&amp;gt&quot; and &quot;&amp;quot&quot;). Instead,
pipe the input through hxunent(1) and, if <br>
needed, asc2xml(1) to convert it to UTF-8.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Remote files (specified with a
URL) are currently only supported for HTTP.
Password-protected files or files that depend on HTTP
&quot;cookies&quot; are not handled. (You can use tools <br>
such as curl(1) or wget(1) to retrieve such files.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The accessibility of an index,
even when generated with option -n, is poor.</p>
