<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
directvnc - a vnc client for the linux framebuffer
device</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
directvnc server:display [options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
DirectVNC is a client implementing the remote framebuffer
protocol (rfb) which is used by VNC servers. If a VNC server
is running on a machine you can connect to it using this
<br>
client and have the contents of its display shown on your
screen. Keyboard and mouse events are sent to the server, so
you can basically control a VNC server remotely. There are
<br>
servers (and other clients) freely available for all
operating systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">What makes DirectVNC different
from other unix vnc clients is that it uses the linux
framebuffer device through the DirectFB library which
enables it to run on anything that has <br>
a framebuffer without the need for a running X server. This
includes embedded devices. DirectFB even uses acceleration
features of certain graphics cards. Thus a lot of
config&acirc; <br>
uration can be done by creating the library specific
configuration file /etc/directfbrc or the program-specific
configuration file /etc/directfbrc.directvnc. See
directfbrc(5) or <br>
find out all about DirectFB here:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">www.directfb.org</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DirectVNC basically provides a
very thin VNC client for unix framebuffer systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">QUITTING <br>
Hitting &lt;ctrl-q&gt; exits the viewer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-h, --help <br>
display help output and exit</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --version <br>
output version information and exit</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, --password <br>
password string to be passed to the server for
authentication. Use this with care!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b, --bpp <br>
the bits per pixel to be used by the client. Currently only
16 and 24 bpp are available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e --encodings <br>
DirectVNC supports several different compression methods to
encode screen updates; this option specifies a set of them
to use in order of preference. Encodings are specified <br>
separated with spaces, and must thus be enclosed in quotes
if more than one is specified. Available encodings, in
default order for a remote connection, are &quot;copyrect
tight <br>
hextile zlib corre rre raw&quot;. For a local connection (to
the same machine), the default order to try is &quot;raw
copyrect tight hextile zlib corre rre&quot;. Raw encoding is
always <br>
assumed as a last option if no other encoding can be used
for some reason.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f --pollfrequency <br>
time in ms to wait between polls for screen updates when no
events are to be processed. This reduces cpu and network
load. Default is 50 ms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --shared (default) <br>
Don&rsquo;t disconnect already connected clients.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --noshared <br>
Disconnect already connected clients.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --nolocalcursor <br>
Disable local cursor tracking By default, and if the server
is capable of the SoftCursor encoding, mouse movements do
not generate framebuffer updates and the cursor state <br>
is kept locally. This removes mouse pointer lag and lets the
connection appear faster.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c --compresslevel level <br>
Use specified compression level (0..9) for &quot;tight&quot;
and &quot;zlib&quot; encodings (only usable with servers
capable of those encodings). Level 1 uses minimum of CPU
time and achieves <br>
weak compression ratios, while level 9 offers best
compression but is slow in terms of CPU time consumption on
the server side. Use high levels with very slow network
con&acirc; <br>
nections, and low levels when working over high-speed LANs.
It&rsquo;s not recommended to use compression level 0,
reasonable choices start from the level 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q --quality level <br>
Use the specified image quality level (0..9) for
&quot;tight&quot; encoding (only usable with servers capable
of those encodings). Specifying this option allows
&quot;tight&quot; encoder to <br>
use lossy JPEG compression. Quality level 0 denotes bad
image quality but very impressive compression ratios, while
level 9 offers very good image quality at lower
compres&acirc; <br>
sion ratios. Note that &quot;tight&quot; encoder uses JPEG
to encode only those screen areas that look suitable for
lossy compression, so quality level 0 does not always mean
unac&acirc; <br>
ceptable image quality.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m --modmap PATH <br>
Path to the modmap (subset of X-style) file to load. With
this option, it is possible to set an alternative keyboard
layout, with ability to support non-latin characters <br>
such as Cyrillic. A plain text file, containing a subset of
xmodmap(1) syntax (only keycode expressions are recognized
with up to four KEYSYMNAMEs) can be converted into the <br>
format that directvnc understands, and can be loaded upon
directvnc startup with this option. See
directvnc-kbmapping(7).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LIMITATIONS <br>
At the moment, it is still necessary to use the --bpp
command line option to set color depth. When negotiating
with the remote VNC server side, color depth supplied by the
server <br>
will be used. It is therefore necessary to make sure (at
least in the present) that screen color depth (default, or
set in the DirectFB configuration file), color depth
supplied <br>
at the command line, and remote VNC server color depth all
match.</p>
