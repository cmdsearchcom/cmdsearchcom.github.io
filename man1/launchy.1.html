Launchy - smart search launcher utility

Launchy is a cross-platform utility designed to help you forget about your start
  menu, the icons on your desktop, and even your file manager.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Launchy indexes the programs in your start menu and can launch your documents,
  project files, folders, and bookmarks with just a few keystrokes.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Once Launchy has been started, it hides in the background. You bring it forward
  by holding the Ctrl and the Space keys. You can then type in a few keys of the
  program you are searching for and hit enter once it has been found. You can
  also make Launchy dissappear again by hitting the Escape key or Ctrl+Space.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Launchy allows you to add additional command line parameters to the selected
  launch. Simply hit Tab key once you have found the application you are
  interested in and then enter the parameters.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When the input text area is empty, press the down arrow key and Launchy will
  display a history of the commands entered previously. You can scroll up and
  down the list and press Enter key to repeat the command. Pressing Shift+Delete
  instead will remove the item from the history.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
-exit 	Attempt to close any running instances of Launchy.
<div class="Pp"></div>
-multiple 	Allows more than one instance of Launchy to be run.
<div class="Pp"></div>
-options 	Shows the options dialog.
<div class="Pp"></div>
-rescan 	Rescan the catalog.
<div class="Pp"></div>
-rescue 	Resets Launchy's position to the center of the screen 	and selects the
  default skin.
<div class="Pp"></div>
-show 	Shows Launchy's window (default is to launch hidden in 	most cases). Can
  be used as a way to active Launchy from 	a shortcut.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If -multiple is not used and Launchy is already running, then the command will
  be sent to the running instance of Launchy.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="KNOWN_ISSUES"><a class="selflink" href="#KNOWN_ISSUES">KNOWN
  ISSUES</a></h1>
Not all skins will work with Linux builds of Launchy. If you're running a
  compositing manager (compiz or beryl) then the skins should look the same as
  in Windows. Otherwise, you will have to settle for the skins that look good
  without alpha transparency (like Default and Black Glass).
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the black area of mask.png is perfectly rectangular then, for some reason,
  compiz won't mask it correctly and you will have a strange black section
  around the skin.
