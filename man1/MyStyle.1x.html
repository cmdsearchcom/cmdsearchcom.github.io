<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
MyStyle - defines combination of color, font, style,
background to be used together</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION OPTIONS <br>
BackColor color</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specifies the background color
associated with this style. color is a color definition in
one of the color formats supported by AfterStep.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BackColor is also used to
calculate bevel colors used to draw a border around a
widget.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BackGradient type from to</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specifies that a gradient should
be used as a background instead of a solid color. The
gradient colors start at from and end at to . from and to
are color definition in <br>
one of the supported color formats . If gradient includes at
least one transparent color ( alpha value set to be below FF
), gradient will be alpha-blended over the root <br>
background image. type can be 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1: Wharf-style diagonal gradient
2: Horizontal from top to bottom 3: Horizontal from
top/bottom to center 4: Vertical from left to right 5:
Vertical from left/right to <br>
center 6: Top-Left to Bottom Right diagonal ( same as 1 ) 7:
Bottom-Left to Top-Right diagonal 8: Vertical Top to Bottom
( same as 2 ) 9: Horizontal Left to Right ( same <br>
as 4 )</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BackMultiGradient type offset1
color1 ... offsetN colorN</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specifies that a gradient should
be used as a background instead of a solid color. The
gradient colors start at color1 and end at colorN . Each
color has an offset associ&acirc; <br>
ated with it. The offset is a number between 0.0 and 1.0,
and specifies where in the gradient the colors are to be
placed. The colors are in one of the color formats
sup&acirc; <br>
ported by AfterStep. At least two colors must be given. If
gradient includes at least one transparent color ( alpha
value set to be below FF ), gradient will be <br>
alpha-blended over the root background image. The offsets
are non-decreasing numbers between 0.0 and 1.0. If the first
offset is not 0.0, it will be set to 0.0. If the <br>
last offset is not 1.0, it will be set to 1.0. type may be
any of the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6: Top-Left to Bottom Right
diagonal 7: Bottom-Left to Top-Right diagonal 8: Vertical
Top to Bottom 9: Horizontal Left to Right</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BackPixmap type
pixmap_name|color_name</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specifies that a pixmap should
be used as a background instead of a solid color. This
option has two forms, depending on the value of type :</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If type is 125, 126, 127, 128,
130-144, 150-164 - the second parameter, pixmap_name must be
the name of an image file which can be found in PixmapPath
.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If type is 129 or 149 the root
pixmap (desktop background) will be used, and the optional
second parameter must be a color with which the root pixmap
will be <br>
shaded/tinted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Depending on the value of type
AfterStep will render pixmap in many different ways :</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">125 Image is SCALED to the size
of the widget, and its opacity is used to set the shape of
the widget/window decoration, achieving non-rectangular
window effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">126 Image is TILED to the size
of the widget, and its opacity is used to set the shape of
the widget/window decoration, achieving non-rectangular
window effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">127 Image is SCALED to the size
of the widget.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">128 Image is Tiled to the size
of the image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">129 Underlying desktop
background is tinted/shaded with the color specified with
the second parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">130 Underlying desktop
background is combined with tiled image, using
&quot;allanon&quot; method - taking average of pixel
values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">131 Underlying desktop
background is alpha-blended with tiled image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">132 Underlying desktop
background is tinted using pixel values of the tiled image,
as a tint values on per-pixel basis.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">133 Each pixel of underlying
desktop background has value of tiled image&rsquo;s pixel
added to it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">134 Each pixel of underlying
desktop background has value of tiled image&rsquo;s pixel
subtracted from it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">135 Result consists of pixels
representing absolute value of difference between underlying
desktop background and tiled image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">136 Underlying desktop
background is darkened using luminocity of the tiled
image&rsquo;s pixels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">137 Underlying desktop
background is lightened using luminocity of the tiled
image&rsquo;s pixels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">138 Underlying desktop
background is &quot;screened&quot; by the tiled image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">139 Underlying desktop
background is &quot;overlayed&quot; by the tiled image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">140 Underlying desktop
background&rsquo;s hue is substituted with the hue of the
tiled image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">141 Underlying desktop
background&rsquo;s saturation is substituted with the
saturation of the tiled image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">142 Underlying desktop
background&rsquo;s value (in HSV colorspace) is substituted
with the value of the tiled image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">143 Underlying desktop
background is &quot;colorized&quot; by the tiled image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">144 Underlying desktop
background is &quot;dissipated&quot; by the tiled image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">149 Underlying desktop
background is tinted/shaded with the color specified with
the second parameter. It differs from 129 so that desktop
background could be both darkened <br>
and brightened. If tint color channel is greater the 7F (127
decimal) - then respective channel of background will be
brightened.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">150 - 164 <br>
Same as 130-144 but specified image is scaled to the size of
the widget.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BlurSize</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FIXME: add proper description
here.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DrawTextBackground [ 0|1 ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specifies that the area behind
text drawn in this style should be cleared to BackColor .
The argument is optional. If the argument is 0, this option
is turned off; if it <br>
is omitted or is nonzero, the option is turned on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specifies the font associated
with this style. font copuld beeither a standard X11 font
definition, or a filename of the TrueType font that could be
found in FontPath. To <br>
specify the size of the TrueType font - use format like that

of the color formats supported by AfterStep.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Inherit &quot; style_name
&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specifies a MyStyle to inherit
options from. Options from style_name will override
previously specified options for this style. Inherit is a
good way to save memory and <br>
network bandwidth if the same BackPixmap is used for several
styles, as the pixmap will only be loaded for the inherited
style.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MyStyle &quot; style_name

here.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SliceXEnd val</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When used with scalable
BackPixmap it will make image sliced instead scaled. Which
means that its borders will remain unchanged, but center
part will get tiled to fill <br>
empty space. SliceXEnd is the left edge of the right
border.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SliceXStart val</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
MyStyle &rsquo;s are the means to define how widgets (menu
items, titlebars, wharf buttons, Pager desktops, etc. )
should be rendered. It defines widget&rsquo;s background
(solid color, gra&acirc; <br>
dient, textured image and/or semitransparent texture), shape
- making widget non-rectangular, text font, text 3D style,
widget&rsquo;s border bevel colors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All the GUI elements are
rendered using consistent approach in every module and every
part of the AfterStep. Interface is build from so called
TBars. TBar is rectangular area <br>
that may be focused(hilited) or unfocused and pressed or
unpressed. TBAR STRUCTURE Each TBar has the following
structure :</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- the background of the TBar,
which is defined by MyStyle and state of the bar - there are
two MyStyles assigned to each TBar - one for focused and one
for unfocused state.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- tiles of the TBar. Tiles are
smaller features that gets arranged inside the bar according
to its size, alignment, position and order. Tiles could be
static icons ( cannot be <br>
pressed ); blocks of buttons - each having two shapes -
pressed and normal; Text labels; Empty space tiles. There
could be up to 256 tiles, each residing on one of the cells
in <br>
8x8 grid. Several tiles could reside in single cell, in
which case they get superimposed on top of each other.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- bevel of the TBar. When TBar
is rendered all of its tiles are superimposed on top of its
background, and resulting image will have a 3D bevel drawn
on it, using colors from <br>
same MyStyle as used for background. Bevel could be switched
off partially or entirely. Respective configuration options
has been added where appropriate. When TBar is pressed -
<br>
its bevel is inverted. TBAR RENDERING When TBar is rendered
all of its elements gets superimposed on top of each other
using one of 13 blending methods supported by
libAfterIm&acirc; <br>
age, with default being simple alphablending. See MyFrame
configuration for more details. This is refrred to as
&quot;Composition Method&quot;.</p>
