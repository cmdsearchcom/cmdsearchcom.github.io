perlref - Perl references and nested data structures
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="NOTE"><a class="selflink" href="#NOTE">NOTE</a></h1>
This is complete documentation about all aspects of references. For a shorter,
  tutorial introduction to just the essential features, see perlreftut.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
Before release 5 of Perl it was difficult to represent complex data structures,
  because all references had to be symbolic--and even then it was difficult to
  refer to a variable instead of a symbol table entry. Perl now not only makes
  it easier to use symbolic references to variables, but also lets you have
  &quot;hard&quot; references to any piece of data or code. Any scalar may hold
  a hard reference. Because arrays and hashes contain scalars, you can now
  easily build arrays of arrays, arrays of hashes, hashes of arrays, arrays of
  hashes of functions, and so on.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Hard references are smart--they keep track of reference counts for you,
  automatically freeing the thing referred to when its reference count goes to
  zero. (Reference counts for values in self-referential or cyclic data
  structures may not go to zero without a little help; see &quot;Circular
  References&quot; for a detailed explanation.) If that thing happens to be an
  object, the object is destructed. See perlobj for more about objects. (In a
  sense, everything in Perl is an object, but we usually reserve the word for
  references to objects that have been officially &quot;blessed&quot; into a
  class package.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
Symbolic references are names of variables or other objects, just as a symbolic
  link in a Unix filesystem contains merely the name of a file. The *glob
  notation is something of a symbolic reference. (Symbolic references are
  sometimes called &quot;soft references&quot;, but please don't call them that;
  references are confusing enough without useless synonyms.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
In contrast, hard references are more like hard links in a Unix file system:
  They are used to access an underlying object without concern for what its
  (other) name is. When the word &quot;reference&quot; is used without an
  adjective, as in the following paragraph, it is usually talking about a hard
  reference.
<div class="Pp"></div>
References are easy to use in Perl. There is just one overriding principle: Perl
  does no implicit referencing or dereferencing. When a scalar is holding a
  reference, it always behaves as a simple scalar. It doesn't magically start
  being an array or hash or subroutine; you have to tell it explicitly to do so,
  by dereferencing it.

References are easy to use in Perl. There is just one overriding principle: in
  general, Perl does no implicit referencing or dereferencing. When a scalar is

  explicitly to do so, by dereferencing it.
<div class="Pp"></div>
That said, be aware that Perl version 5.14 introduces an exception to the rule,
  for syntactic convenience. Experimental array and hash container function
  behavior allows array and hash references to be handled by Perl as if they had
  been explicitly syntactically dereferenced. See &quot;Syntactical
  Enhancements&quot; in perl5140delta and perlfunc for details.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Making_References"><a class="selflink" href="#Making_References">Making
  References</a></h2>
References can be created in several ways.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">1.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">By using the backslash operator on a variable, subroutine,
      or value. (This works much like the &amp; (address-of) operator in C.)
      This typically creates <i>another</i> reference to a variable, because
      there's already a reference to the variable in the symbol table. But the
      symbol table reference might go away, and you'll still have the reference
      that the backslash returned. Here are some examples:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    $scalarref = \$foo;
    $arrayref  = \@ARGV;
    $hashref   = \%ENV;
    $coderef   = \&amp;handler;
    $globref   = \*foo;
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    It isn't possible to create a true reference to an IO handle (filehandle or
      dirhandle) using the backslash operator. The most you can get is a
      reference to a typeglob, which is actually a complete symbol table entry.
      But see the explanation of the *foo{THING} syntax below. However, you can
      still use type globs and globrefs as though they were IO handles.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">2.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">A reference to an anonymous array can be created using
      square brackets:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    $arrayref = [1, 2, ['a', 'b', 'c']];
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Here we've created a reference to an anonymous array of three elements whose
      final element is itself a reference to another anonymous array of three
      elements. (The multidimensional syntax described later can be used to
      access this. For example, after the above,
      &quot;$arrayref-&gt;[2][1]&quot; would have the value &quot;b&quot;.)
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Taking a reference to an enumerated list is not the same as using square
      brackets--instead it's the same as creating a list of references!
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    @list = (\$a, \@b, \%c);
    @list = \($a, @b, %c);      # same thing!
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    As a special case, &quot;\(@foo)&quot; returns a list of references to the
      contents of @foo, not a reference to @foo itself. Likewise for %foo,
      except that the key references are to copies (since the keys are just
      strings rather than full-fledged scalars).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">3.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">A reference to an anonymous hash can be created using curly
      brackets:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    $hashref = {
        'Adam'  =&gt; 'Eve',
        'Clyde' =&gt; 'Bonnie',
    };
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Anonymous hash and array composers like these can be intermixed freely to
      produce as complicated a structure as you want. The multidimensional
      syntax described below works for these too. The values above are literals,
      but variables and expressions would work just as well, because assignment
      operators in Perl (even within <i>local()</i> or <i>my()</i>) are
      executable statements, not compile-time declarations.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Because curly brackets (braces) are used for several other things including
      BLOCKs, you may occasionally have to disambiguate braces at the beginning
      of a statement by putting a &quot;+&quot; or a &quot;return&quot; in front
      so that Perl realizes the opening brace isn't starting a BLOCK. The
      economy and mnemonic value of using curlies is deemed worth this
      occasional extra hassle.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    For example, if you wanted a function to make a new hash and return a
      reference to it, you have these options:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    sub hashem {        { @_ } }   # silently wrong
    sub hashem {       +{ @_ } }   # ok
    sub hashem { return { @_ } }   # ok
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    On the other hand, if you want the other meaning, you can do this:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    sub showem {        { @_ } }   # ambiguous (currently ok, but may change)
    sub showem {       {; @_ } }   # ok
    sub showem { { return @_ } }   # ok
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The leading &quot;+{&quot; and &quot;{;&quot; always serve to disambiguate
      the expression to mean either the HASH reference, or the BLOCK.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">4.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">A reference to an anonymous subroutine can be created by
      using &quot;sub&quot; without a subname:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    $coderef = sub { print &quot;Boink!\n&quot; };
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Note the semicolon. Except for the code inside not being immediately
      executed, a &quot;sub {}&quot; is not so much a declaration as it is an
      operator, like &quot;do{}&quot; or &quot;eval{}&quot;. (However, no matter
      how many times you execute that particular line (unless you're in an
      &quot;eval(&quot;...&quot;)&quot;), $coderef will still have a reference
      to the <i>same</i> anonymous subroutine.)
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Anonymous subroutines act as closures with respect to <i>my()</i> variables,
      that is, variables lexically visible within the current scope. Closure is
      a notion out of the Lisp world that says if you define an anonymous
      function in a particular lexical context, it pretends to run in that
      context even when it's called outside the context.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    In human terms, it's a funny way of passing arguments to a subroutine when
      you define it as well as when you call it. It's useful for setting up
      little bits of code to run later, such as callbacks. You can even do
      object-oriented stuff with it, though Perl already provides a different
      mechanism to do that--see perlobj.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    You might also think of closure as a way to write a subroutine template
      without using <i>eval()</i>. Here's a small example of how closures work:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    sub newprint {
        my $x = shift;
        return sub { my $y = shift; print &quot;$x, $y!\n&quot;; };
    }
    $h = newprint(&quot;Howdy&quot;);
    $g = newprint(&quot;Greetings&quot;);
    # Time passes...
    &amp;$h(&quot;world&quot;);
    &amp;$g(&quot;earthlings&quot;);
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This prints
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    Howdy, world!
    Greetings, earthlings!
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Note particularly that $x continues to refer to the value passed into
      <i>newprint()</i> <i>despite</i> &quot;my $x&quot; having gone out of
      scope by the time the anonymous subroutine runs. That's what a closure is
      all about.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This applies only to lexical variables, by the way. Dynamic variables
      continue to work as they have always worked. Closure is not something that
      most Perl programmers need trouble themselves about to begin with.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">5.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">References are often returned by special subroutines called
      constructors. Perl objects are just references to a special type of object
      that happens to know which package it's associated with. Constructors are
      just special subroutines that know how to create that association. They do
      so by starting with an ordinary reference, and it remains an ordinary
      reference even while it's also being an object. Constructors are often
      named &quot;new()&quot;. You <i>can</i> call them indirectly:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    $objref = new Doggie( Tail =&gt; 'short', Ears =&gt; 'long' );
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    But that can produce ambiguous syntax in certain cases, so it's often better
      to use the direct method invocation approach:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    $objref   = Doggie-&gt;new(Tail =&gt; 'short', Ears =&gt; 'long');
    use Term::Cap;
    $terminal = Term::Cap-&gt;Tgetent( { OSPEED =&gt; 9600 });
    use Tk;
    $main    = MainWindow-&gt;new();
    $menubar = $main-&gt;Frame(-relief              =&gt; &quot;raised&quot;,

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">7.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">A reference can be created by using a special syntax,
      lovingly known as the *foo{THING} syntax. *foo{THING} returns a reference
      to the THING slot in *foo (which is the symbol table entry which holds
      everything known as foo).
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    $scalarref = *foo{SCALAR};
    $arrayref  = *ARGV{ARRAY};
    $hashref   = *ENV{HASH};
    $coderef   = *handler{CODE};
    $ioref     = *STDIN{IO};

    $formatref = *foo{FORMAT};
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    All of these are self-explanatory except for *foo{IO}. It returns the IO
      handle, used for file handles (&quot;open&quot; in perlfunc), sockets
      (&quot;socket&quot; in perlfunc and &quot;socketpair&quot; in perlfunc),
      and directory handles (&quot;opendir&quot; in perlfunc). For compatibility
      with previous versions of Perl, *foo{FILEHANDLE} is a synonym for
      *foo{IO}, though it is deprecated as of 5.8.0. If deprecation warnings are
      in effect, it will warn of its use.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    *foo{THING} returns undef if that particular THING hasn't been used yet,
      except in the case of scalars. *foo{SCALAR} returns a reference to an
      anonymous scalar if $foo hasn't been used yet. This might change in a
      future release.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    *foo{IO} is an alternative to the *HANDLE mechanism given in &quot;Typeglobs
      and Filehandles&quot; in perldata for passing filehandles into or out of
      subroutines, or storing into larger data structures. Its disadvantage is
      that it won't create a new filehandle for you. Its advantage is that you
      have less risk of clobbering more than you want to with a typeglob
      assignment. (It still conflates file and directory handles, though.)
      However, if you assign the incoming value to a scalar instead of a
      typeglob as we do in the examples below, there's no risk of that
      happening.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    splutter(*STDOUT);          # pass the whole glob
    splutter(*STDOUT{IO});      # pass both file and dir handles

        print $fh &quot;her um well a hmmm\n&quot;;
    }
    $rec = get_rec(*STDIN);     # pass the whole glob
    $rec = get_rec(*STDIN{IO}); # pass both file and dir handles

<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Using_References"><a class="selflink" href="#Using_References">Using
  References</a></h2>
That's it for creating references. By now you're probably dying to know how to
  use references to get back to your long-lost data. There are several basic
  methods.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">1.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Anywhere you'd put an identifier (or chain of identifiers)
      as part of a variable or subroutine name, you can replace the identifier
      with a simple scalar variable containing a reference of the correct type:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    $bar = $$scalarref;
    push(@$arrayref, $filename);
    $$arrayref[0] = &quot;January&quot;;
    $$hashref{&quot;KEY&quot;} = &quot;VALUE&quot;;
    &amp;$coderef(1,2,3);
    print $globref &quot;output\n&quot;;
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    It's important to understand that we are specifically <i>not</i>
      dereferencing $arrayref[0] or $hashref{&quot;KEY&quot;} there. The
      dereference of the scalar variable happens <i>before</i> it does any key
      lookups. Anything more complicated than a simple scalar variable must use
      methods 2 or 3 below. However, a &quot;simple scalar&quot; includes an
      identifier that itself uses method 1 recursively. Therefore, the following
      prints &quot;howdy&quot;.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    $refrefref = \\\&quot;howdy&quot;;
    print $$$$refrefref;
    </pre>
  </dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">2.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Anywhere you'd put an identifier (or chain of identifiers)
      as part of a variable or subroutine name, you can replace the identifier
      with a BLOCK returning a reference of the correct type. In other words,
      the previous examples could be written like this:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    $bar = ${$scalarref};
    push(@{$arrayref}, $filename);
    ${$arrayref}[0] = &quot;January&quot;;
    ${$hashref}{&quot;KEY&quot;} = &quot;VALUE&quot;;
    &amp;{$coderef}(1,2,3);
    $globref-&gt;print(&quot;output\n&quot;);  # iff IO::Handle is loaded
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Admittedly, it's a little silly to use the curlies in this case, but the
      BLOCK can contain any arbitrary expression, in particular, subscripted
      expressions:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    &amp;{ $dispatch{$index} }(1,2,3);      # call correct routine
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Because of being able to omit the curlies for the simple case of $$x, people
      often make the mistake of viewing the dereferencing symbols as proper
      operators, and wonder about their precedence. If they were, though, you
      could use parentheses instead of braces. That's not the case. Consider the
      difference below; case 0 is a short-hand version of case 1, <i>not</i>
      case 2:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    $$hashref{&quot;KEY&quot;}   = &quot;VALUE&quot;;       # CASE 0
    ${$hashref}{&quot;KEY&quot;} = &quot;VALUE&quot;;       # CASE 1
    ${$hashref{&quot;KEY&quot;}} = &quot;VALUE&quot;;       # CASE 2
    ${$hashref-&gt;{&quot;KEY&quot;}} = &quot;VALUE&quot;;     # CASE 3
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Case 2 is also deceptive in that you're accessing a variable called
      %hashref, not dereferencing through $hashref to the hash it's presumably
      referencing. That would be case 3.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">3.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Subroutine calls and lookups of individual array elements
      arise often enough that it gets cumbersome to use method 2. As a form of
      syntactic sugar, the examples for method 2 may be written:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    $arrayref-&gt;[0] = &quot;January&quot;;   # Array element
    $hashref-&gt;{&quot;KEY&quot;} = &quot;VALUE&quot;;  # Hash element
    $coderef-&gt;(1,2,3);            # Subroutine call
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The left side of the arrow can be any expression returning a reference,
      including a previous dereference. Note that $array[$x] is <i>not</i> the
      same thing as &quot;$array-&gt;[$x]&quot; here:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    $array[$x]-&gt;{&quot;foo&quot;}-&gt;[0] = &quot;January&quot;;
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This is one of the cases we mentioned earlier in which references could
      spring into existence when in an lvalue context. Before this statement,
      $array[$x] may have been undefined. If so, it's automatically defined with
      a hash reference so that we can look up &quot;{&quot;foo&quot;}&quot; in
      it. Likewise &quot;$array[$x]-&gt;{&quot;foo&quot;}&quot; will
      automatically get defined with an array reference so that we can look up
      &quot;[0]&quot; in it. This process is called <i>autovivification</i>.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    One more thing here. The arrow is optional <i>between</i> brackets
      subscripts, so you can shrink the above down to
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    $array[$x]{&quot;foo&quot;}[0] = &quot;January&quot;;
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Which, in the degenerate case of using only ordinary arrays, gives you
      multidimensional arrays just like C's:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>

Using a string or number as a reference produces a symbolic reference, as
  explained above. Using a reference as a number produces an integer
  representing its storage location in memory. The only useful thing to be done
  with this is to compare two references numerically to see whether they refer
  to the same location.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    if ($ref1 == $ref2) {  # cheap numeric compare of references
        print &quot;refs 1 and 2 refer to the same thing\n&quot;;
    }
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Using a reference as a string produces both its referent's type, including any
  package blessing as described in perlobj, as well as the numeric address
  expressed in hex. The <i>ref()</i> operator returns just the type of thing the
  reference is pointing to, without the address. See &quot;ref&quot; in perlfunc
  for details and examples of its use.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <i>bless()</i> operator may be used to associate the object a reference
  points to with a package functioning as an object class. See perlobj.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A typeglob may be dereferenced the same way a reference can, because the
  dereference syntax always indicates the type of reference desired. So
  &quot;${*foo}&quot; and &quot;${\$foo}&quot; both indicate the same scalar
  variable.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Here's a trick for interpolating a subroutine call into a string:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    print &quot;My sub returned @{[mysub(1,2,3)]} that time.\n&quot;;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The way it works is that when the &quot;@{...}&quot; is seen in the
  double-quoted string, it's evaluated as a block. The block creates a reference
  to an anonymous array containing the results of the call to
  &quot;mysub(1,2,3)&quot;. So the whole block returns a reference to an array,
  which is then dereferenced by &quot;@{...}&quot; and stuck into the
  double-quoted string. This chicanery is also useful for arbitrary expressions:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    print &quot;That yields @{[$n + 5]} widgets\n&quot;;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Similarly, an expression that returns a reference to a scalar can be
  dereferenced via &quot;${...}&quot;. Thus, the above expression may be written
  as:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    print &quot;That yields ${\($n + 5)} widgets\n&quot;;
</pre>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Circular_References"><a class="selflink" href="#Circular_References">Circular
  References</a></h2>
It is possible to create a &quot;circular reference&quot; in Perl, which can
  lead to memory leaks. A circular reference occurs when two references contain
  a reference to each other, like this:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    my $foo = {};
    my $bar = { foo =&gt; $foo };
    $foo-&gt;{bar} = $bar;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can also create a circular reference with a single variable:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    my $foo;
    $foo = \$foo;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
In this case, the reference count for the variables will never reach 0, and the
  references will never be garbage-collected. This can lead to memory leaks.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Because objects in Perl are implemented as references, it's possible to have
  circular references with objects as well. Imagine a TreeNode class where each
  node references its parent and child nodes. Any node with a parent will be
  part of a circular reference.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can break circular references by creating a &quot;weak reference&quot;. A
  weak reference does not increment the reference count for a variable, which
  means that the object can go out of scope and be destroyed. You can weaken a
  reference with the &quot;weaken&quot; function exported by the Scalar::Util
  module.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Here's how we can make the first example safer:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    use Scalar::Util 'weaken';
    my $foo = {};
    my $bar = { foo =&gt; $foo };
    $foo-&gt;{bar} = $bar;
    weaken $foo-&gt;{bar};
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The reference from $foo to $bar has been weakened. When the $bar variable goes
  out of scope, it will be garbage-collected. The next time you look at the
  value of the &quot;$foo-&gt;{bar}&quot; key, it will be &quot;undef&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This action at a distance can be confusing, so you should be careful with your
  use of weaken. You should weaken the reference in the variable that will go
  out of scope <i>first</i>. That way, the longer-lived variable will contain
  the expected reference until it goes out of scope.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Symbolic_references"><a class="selflink" href="#Symbolic_references">Symbolic
  references</a></h2>
We said that references spring into existence as necessary if they are
  undefined, but we didn't say what happens if a value used as a reference is
  already defined, but <i>isn't</i> a hard reference. If you use it as a
  reference, it'll be treated as a symbolic reference. That is, the value of the
  scalar is taken to be the <i>name</i> of a variable, rather than a direct link
  to a (possibly) anonymous value.
<div class="Pp"></div>
People frequently expect it to work like this. So it does.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    $name = &quot;foo&quot;;
    $$name = 1;                 # Sets $foo
    ${$name} = 2;               # Sets $foo
    ${$name x 2} = 3;           # Sets $foofoo
    $name-&gt;[0] = 4;             # Sets $foo[0]
    @$name = ();                # Clears @foo
    &amp;$name();                   # Calls &amp;foo() (as in Perl 4)
    $pack = &quot;THAT&quot;;
    ${&quot;${pack}::$name&quot;} = 5;    # Sets $THAT::foo without eval
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This is powerful, and slightly dangerous, in that it's possible to intend (with
  the utmost sincerity) to use a hard reference, and accidentally use a symbolic
  reference instead. To protect against that, you can say
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    use strict 'refs';
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
and then only hard references will be allowed for the rest of the enclosing
  block. An inner block may countermand that with
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    no strict 'refs';
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Only package variables (globals, even if localized) are visible to symbolic
  references. Lexical variables (declared with <i>my()</i>) aren't in a symbol
  table, and thus are invisible to this mechanism. For example:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    local $value = 10;
    $ref = &quot;value&quot;;
    {
        my $value = 20;
        print $$ref;
    }
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This will still print 10, not 20. Remember that <i>local()</i> affects package
  variables, which are all &quot;global&quot; to the package.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Not-so-symbolic_references"><a class="selflink" href="#Not-so-symbolic_references">Not-so-symbolic
  references</a></h2>
Since Perl verion 5.001, brackets around a symbolic reference can simply serve
  to isolate an identifier or variable name from the rest of an expression, just
  as they always have within a string. For example,
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    $push = &quot;pop on &quot;;
    print &quot;${push}over&quot;;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
has always meant to print &quot;pop on over&quot;, even though push is a
  reserved word. In 5.001, this was generalized to work the same without the
  enclosing double quotes, so that
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    print ${push} . &quot;over&quot;;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
and even
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    print ${ push } . &quot;over&quot;;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
will have the same effect. (This would have been a syntax error in Perl 5.000,
  though Perl 4 allowed it in the spaceless form.) This construct is <i>not</i>
  considered to be a symbolic reference when you're using strict refs:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    use strict 'refs';
    ${ bareword };      # Okay, means $bareword.
    ${ &quot;bareword&quot; };    # Error, symbolic reference.
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Similarly, because of all the subscripting that is done using single words, the
  same rule applies to any bareword that is used for subscripting a hash. So
  now, instead of writing
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    $array{ &quot;aaa&quot; }{ &quot;bbb&quot; }{ &quot;ccc&quot; }
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
you can write just
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    $array{ aaa }{ bbb }{ ccc }
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
and not worry about whether the subscripts are reserved words. In the rare event
  that you do wish to do something like
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    $array{ shift }
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
you can force interpretation as a reserved word by adding anything that makes it
  more than a bareword:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    $array{ shift() }
    $array{ +shift }
    $array{ shift @_ }
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The &quot;use warnings&quot; pragma or the <b>-w</b> switch will warn you if it
  interprets a reserved word as a string. But it will no longer warn you about
  using lowercase words, because the string is effectively quoted.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Pseudo-hashes:_Using_an_array_as_a_hash"><a class="selflink" href="#Pseudo-hashes:_Using_an_array_as_a_hash">Pseudo-hashes:
  Using an array as a hash</a></h2>
Pseudo-hashes have been removed from Perl. The 'fields' pragma remains
  available.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Function_Templates"><a class="selflink" href="#Function_Templates">Function
  Templates</a></h2>
As explained above, an anonymous function with access to the lexical variables
  visible when that function was compiled, creates a closure. It retains access
  to those variables even though it doesn't get run until later, such as in a
  signal handler or a Tk callback.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Using a closure as a function template allows us to generate many functions that
  act similarly. Suppose you wanted functions named after the colors that
  generated HTML font changes for the various colors:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    print &quot;Be &quot;, red(&quot;careful&quot;), &quot;with that &quot;, green(&quot;light&quot;);
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <i>red()</i> and <i>green()</i> functions would be similar. To create these,
  we'll assign a closure to a typeglob of the name of the function we're trying
  to build.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    @colors = qw(red blue green yellow orange purple violet);
    for my $name (@colors) {
        no strict 'refs';       # allow symbol table manipulation
        *$name = *{uc $name} = sub { &quot;&lt;FONT COLOR='$name'&gt;@_&lt;/FONT&gt;&quot; };
    }
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Now all those different functions appear to exist independently. You can call
  <i>red()</i>, <i>RED()</i>, <i>blue()</i>, <i>BLUE()</i>, <i>green()</i>, etc.
  This technique saves on both compile time and memory use, and is less
  error-prone as well, since syntax checks happen at compile time. It's critical
  that any variables in the anonymous subroutine be lexicals in order to create
  a proper closure. That's the reasons for the &quot;my&quot; on the loop
  iteration variable.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This is one of the only places where giving a prototype to a closure makes much
  sense. If you wanted to impose scalar context on the arguments of these
  functions (probably not a wise idea for this particular example), you could
  have written it this way instead:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    *$name = sub ($) { &quot;&lt;FONT COLOR='$name'&gt;$_[0]&lt;/FONT&gt;&quot; };
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
However, since prototype checking happens at compile time, the assignment above
  happens too late to be of much use. You could address this by putting the
  whole loop of assignments within a BEGIN block, forcing it to occur during
  compilation.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Access to lexicals that change over time--like those in the &quot;for&quot; loop
  above, basically aliases to elements from the surrounding lexical scopes--
  only works with anonymous subs, not with named subroutines. Generally said,
  named subroutines do not nest properly and should only be declared in the main
  package scope.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This is because named subroutines are created at compile time so their lexical
  variables get assigned to the parent lexicals from the first execution of the
  parent block. If a parent scope is entered a second time, its lexicals are
  created again, while the nested subs still reference the old ones.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Anonymous subroutines get to capture each time you execute the &quot;sub&quot;
  operator, as they are created on the fly. If you are accustomed to using
  nested subroutines in other programming languages with their own private
  variables, you'll have to work at it a bit in Perl. The intuitive coding of
  this type of thing incurs mysterious warnings about &quot;will not stay
  shared&quot; due to the reasons explained above. For example, this won't work:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    sub outer {
        my $x = $_[0] + 35;
        sub inner { return $x * 19 }   # WRONG
        return $x + inner();
    }
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
A work-around is the following:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    sub outer {
        my $x = $_[0] + 35;
        local *inner = sub { return $x * 19 };
        return $x + inner();
    }
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Now <i>inner()</i> can only be called from within <i>outer()</i>, because of the
  temporary assignments of the anonymous subroutine. But when it does, it has
  normal access to the lexical variable $x from the scope of <i>outer()</i> at
  the time outer is invoked.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This has the interesting effect of creating a function local to another
  function, something not normally supported in Perl.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="WARNING"><a class="selflink" href="#WARNING">WARNING</a></h1>
You may not (usefully) use a reference as the key to a hash. It will be
  converted into a string:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    $x{ \$a } = $a;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you try to dereference the key, it won't do a hard dereference, and you won't
  accomplish what you're attempting. You might want to do something more like
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    $r = \@a;
    $x{ $r } = $r;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
And then at least you can use the <i>values()</i>, which will be real refs,
  instead of the <i>keys()</i>, which won't.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The standard Tie::RefHash module provides a convenient workaround to this.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SEE_ALSO"><a class="selflink" href="#SEE_ALSO">SEE
  ALSO</a></h1>
Besides the obvious documents, source code can be instructive. Some pathological
  examples of the use of references can be found in the <i>t/op/ref.t</i>
  regression test in the Perl source directory.
