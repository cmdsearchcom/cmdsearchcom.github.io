<b>Write</b> allows you to communicate with other users, by copying lines from
  your terminal to theirs.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When you run the <b>write</b> command, the user you are writing to gets a
  message of the form:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Message from yourname@yourhost on yourtty at
  hh:mm ...</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Any further lines you enter will be copied to the specified user's terminal. If
  the other user wants to reply, they must run <b>write</b> as well.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When you are done, type an end-of-file or interrupt character. The other user
  will see the message <b>EOF</b> indicating that the conversation is over.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can prevent people (other than the super-user) from writing to you with the
  <b>mesg</b>(1) command. Some commands, for example <b>nroff</b>(1) and
  <b>pr</b>(1), may disallow writing automatically, so that your output isn't
  overwritten.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the user you want to write to is logged in on more than one terminal, you can
  specify which terminal to write to by specifying the terminal name as the
  second operand to the <b>write</b> command. Alternatively, you can let
  <b>write</b> select one of the terminals - it will pick the one with the
  shortest idle time. This is so that if the user is logged in at work and also
  dialed up from home, the message will go to the right place.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The traditional protocol for writing to someone is that the string `-o', either
  at the end of a line or on a line by itself, means that it's the other
  person's turn to talk. The string `oo' means that the person believes the
  conversation to be over.

A <b>write</b> command appeared in Version 6 AT&amp;T UNIX.

The write command is part of the util-linux package and is available from
