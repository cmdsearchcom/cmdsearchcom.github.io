<p>SORT(1POSIX) POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s Manual
SORT(1POSIX)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROLOG <br>
This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s
Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of <br>
Linux behavior), or the interface may not be implemented on
Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
sort &acirc; sort, merge, or sequence check text files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
sort [&acirc;m] [&acirc;o output] [&acirc;bdfinru] [&acirc;t
char] [&acirc;k keydef]... [file...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sort [&acirc;c|&acirc;C]
[&acirc;bdfinru] [&acirc;t char] [&acirc;k keydef]
[file]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The sort utility shall perform one of the following
functions:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. Sort lines of all the named
files together and write the result to the specified
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Merge lines of all the named
(presorted) files together and write the result to the
specified output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. Check that a single input
file is correctly presorted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Comparisons shall be based on
one or more sort keys extracted from each line of input (or,
if no sort keys are specified, the entire line up to, but
not including, the terminat&acirc; <br>
ing &lt;newline&gt;), and shall be performed using the
collating sequence of the current locale.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The sort utility shall conform to the Base Definitions
volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax
Guidelines, except for Guideline 9, and the &acirc;k keydef
option should <br>
follow the &acirc;b, &acirc;d, &acirc;f, &acirc;i, &acirc;n,
and &acirc;r options. In addition, &rsquo;+&rsquo; may be
recognized as an option delimiter as well as
&rsquo;&acirc;&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options shall be
supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;c Check that the single
input file is ordered as specified by the arguments and the
collating sequence of the current locale. Output shall not
be sent to standard output. <br>
The exit code shall indicate whether or not disorder was
detected or an error occurred. If disorder (or, with
&acirc;u, a duplicate key) is detected, a warning message
shall <br>
be sent to standard error indicating where the disorder or
duplicate key was found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;C Same as &acirc;c,
except that a warning message shall not be sent to standard
error if disorder or, with &acirc;u, a duplicate key is
detected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;m Merge only; the input
file shall be assumed to be already sorted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;o output Specify the name
of an output file to be used instead of the standard output.
This file can be the same as one of the input files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;u Unique: suppress all
but one in each set of lines having equal keys. If used with
the &acirc;c option, check that there are no lines with
duplicate keys, in addition to <br>
checking that the input file is sorted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options shall
override the default ordering rules. When ordering options
appear independent of any key field specifications, the
requested field ordering rules <br>
shall be applied globally to all sort keys. When attached to
a specific key (see &acirc;k), the specified ordering
options shall override all global ordering options for that
key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;d Specify that only
&lt;blank&gt; characters and alphanumeric characters,
according to the current setting of LC_CTYPE, shall be
significant in comparisons. The behavior is <br>
undefined for a sort key to which &acirc;i or &acirc;n also
applies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;f Consider all lowercase
characters that have uppercase equivalents, according to the
current setting of LC_CTYPE, to be the uppercase equivalent
for the purposes of com&acirc; <br>
parison.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;i Ignore all characters
that are non-printable, according to the current setting of
LC_CTYPE. The behavior is undefined for a sort key for which
&acirc;n also applies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;n Restrict the sort key
to an initial numeric string, consisting of optional
&lt;blank&gt; characters, optional minus-sign, and zero or
more digits with an optional radix char&acirc; <br>
acter and thousands separators (as defined in the current
locale), which shall be sorted by arithmetic value. An empty
digit string shall be treated as zero. Leading <br>
zeros and signs on zeros shall not affect ordering.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;r Reverse the sense of
comparisons.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The treatment of field
separators can be altered using the options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;b Ignore leading
&lt;blank&gt; characters when determining the starting and
ending positions of a restricted sort key. If the &acirc;b
option is specified before the first &acirc;k option, <br>
it shall be applied to all &acirc;k options. Otherwise, the
&acirc;b option can be attached independently to each
&acirc;k field_start or field_end option-argument (see
below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;t char Use char as the
field separator character; char shall not be considered to
be part of a field (although it can be included in a sort
key). Each occurrence of char shall <br>
be significant (for example, &lt;char&gt;&lt;char&gt;
delimits an empty field). If &acirc;t is not specified,
&lt;blank&gt; characters shall be used as default field
separators; each maximal <br>
non-empty sequence of &lt;blank&gt; characters that follows
a non-&lt;blank&gt; shall be a field separator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sort keys can be specified using
the options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;k keydef The keydef
argument is a restricted sort key field definition. The
format of this definition is:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">field_start[type][,field_end[type]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where field_start and field_end
define a key field restricted to a portion of the line (see
the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION section), and type is a modifier
from the list of <br>
characters &rsquo;b&rsquo;, &rsquo;d&rsquo;,
&rsquo;f&rsquo;, &rsquo;i&rsquo;, &rsquo;n&rsquo;,
&rsquo;r&rsquo;. The &rsquo;b&rsquo; modifier shall behave
like the &acirc;b option, but shall apply only to the
field_start or field_end to which it is <br>
attached. The other modifiers shall behave like the
corresponding options, but shall apply only to the key field
to which they are attached; they shall have this effect <br>
if specified with field_start, field_end, or both. If any
modifier is attached to a field_start or to a field_end, no
option shall apply to either. Implementations <br>
shall support at least nine occurrences of the &acirc;k
option, which shall be significant in command line order. If
no &acirc;k option is specified, a default sort key of the
<br>
entire line shall be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When there are multiple key
fields, later keys shall be compared only after all earlier
keys compare equal. Except when the &acirc;u option is
specified, lines that otherwise <br>
compare equal shall be ordered as if none of the options
&acirc;d, &acirc;f, &acirc;i, &acirc;n, or &acirc;k were
present (but with &acirc;r still in effect, if it was
specified) and with all bytes in the <br>
lines significant to the comparison. The order in which
lines that still compare equal are written is
unspecified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERANDS <br>
The following operand shall be supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file A pathname of a file to be
sorted, merged, or checked. If no file operands are
specified, or if a file operand is &rsquo;&acirc;&rsquo;,
the standard input shall be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDIN <br>
The standard input shall be used only if no file operands
are specified, or if a file operand is
&rsquo;&acirc;&rsquo;. See the INPUT FILES section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUT FILES <br>
The input files shall be text files, except that the sort
utility shall add a &lt;newline&gt; to the end of a file
ending with an incomplete last line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
The following environment variables shall affect the
execution of sort:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LANG Provide a default value for
the internationalization variables that are unset or null.
(See the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008,
Section 8.2, Internationaliza&acirc; <br>
tion Variables for the precedence of internationalization
variables used to determine the values of locale
categories.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_ALL If set to a non-empty
string value, override the values of all the other
internationalization variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_COLLATE <br>
Determine the locale for ordering rules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_CTYPE Determine the locale
for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text data as
characters (for example, single-byte as opposed to
multi-byte characters in arguments <br>
and input files) and the behavior of character
classification for the &acirc;b, &acirc;d, &acirc;f,
&acirc;i, and &acirc;n options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_MESSAGES <br>
Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
standard error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_NUMERIC <br>
Determine the locale for the definition of the radix
character and thousands separator for the &acirc;n
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NLSPATH Determine the location
of message catalogs for the processing of LC_MESSAGES.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDOUT <br>
Unless the &acirc;o or &acirc;c options are in effect, the
standard output shall contain the sorted input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDERR <br>
The standard error shall be used for diagnostic messages.
When &acirc;c is specified, if disorder is detected (or if
&acirc;u is also specified and a duplicate key is detected),
a message <br>
shall be written to the standard error which identifies the
input line at which disorder (or a duplicate key) was
detected. A warning message about correcting an incomplete
last <br>
line of an input file may be generated, but need not affect
the final exit status.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT FILES <br>
If the &acirc;o option is in effect, the sorted input shall
be written to the file output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTENDED DESCRIPTION <br>
The notation:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;k
field_start[type][,field_end[type]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">shall define a key field that
begins at field_start and ends at field_end inclusive,
unless field_start falls beyond the end of the line or after
field_end, in which case the key <br>
field is empty. A missing field_end shall mean the last
character of the line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A field comprises a maximal
sequence of non-separating characters and, in the absence of
option &acirc;t, any preceding field separator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The field_start portion of the
keydef option-argument shall have the form:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">field_number[.first_character]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fields and characters within
fields shall be numbered starting with 1. The field_number
and first_character pieces, interpreted as positive decimal
integers, shall specify the <br>
first character to be used as part of a sort key. If
.first_character is omitted, it shall refer to the first
character of the field.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The field_end portion of the
keydef option-argument shall have the form:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">field_number[.last_character]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The field_number shall be as
described above for field_start. The last_character piece,
interpreted as a non-negative decimal integer, shall specify
the last character to be <br>
used as part of the sort key. If last_character evaluates to
zero or .last_character is omitted, it shall refer to the
last character of the field specified by field_number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the &acirc;b option or b type
modifier is in effect, characters within a field shall be
counted from the first non-&lt;blank&gt; in the field. (This
shall apply separately to first_char&acirc; <br>
acter and last_character.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The following exit values shall be returned:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 All input files were output
successfully, or &acirc;c was specified and the input file
was correctly sorted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 Under the &acirc;c option, the
file was not ordered as specified, or if the &acirc;c and
&acirc;u options were both specified, two input lines were
found with equal keys.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt;1 An error occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following sections are
informative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">APPLICATION USAGE <br>
The default value for &acirc;t, &lt;blank&gt;, has different
properties from, for example,
&acirc;t&quot;&lt;space&gt;&quot;. If a line contains:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;space&gt;&lt;space&gt;foo</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">the following treatment would
occur with default separation as opposed to specifically
selecting a &lt;space&gt;:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&not;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&not;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;
<br>
&acirc;Field &acirc; Default &acirc; &acirc;t
&quot;&lt;space&gt;&quot; &acirc; <br>

&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&frac14;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&frac14;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&curren;
<br>
&acirc; 1 &acirc; &lt;space&gt;&lt;space&gt;foo &acirc;
empty &acirc; <br>
&acirc; 2 &acirc; empty &acirc; empty &acirc; <br>
&acirc; 3 &acirc; empty &acirc; foo &acirc; <br>

&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acute;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acute;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;
<br>
The leading field separator itself is included in a field
when &acirc;t is not used. For example, this command returns
an exit status of zero, meaning the input was already
sorted:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sort &acirc;c &acirc;k 2
&lt;&lt;eof <br>
y&lt;tab&gt;b <br>
x&lt;space&gt;a <br>
eof</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(assuming that a &lt;tab&gt;
precedes the &lt;space&gt; in the current collating
sequence). The field separator is not included in a field
when it is explicitly set via &acirc;t. This is
histori&acirc; <br>
cal practice and allows usage such as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sort &acirc;t &quot;|&quot;
&acirc;k 2n &lt;&lt;eof <br>
Atlanta|425022|Georgia <br>
Birmingham|284413|Alabama <br>
Columbia|100385|South Carolina <br>
eof</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where the second field can be
correctly sorted numerically without regard to the
non-numeric field separator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The wording in the OPTIONS
section clarifies that the &acirc;b, &acirc;d, &acirc;f,
&acirc;i, &acirc;n, and &acirc;r options have to come before
the first sort key specified if they are intended to apply
to all <br>
specified keys. The way it is described in this volume of
POSIX.1&acirc;2008 matches historical practice, not
historical documentation. The results are unspecified if
these options <br>
are specified after a &acirc;k option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &acirc;f option might not
work as expected in locales where there is not a one-to-one
mapping between an uppercase and a lowercase letter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
1. The following command sorts the contents of infile with
the second field as the sort key:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sort &acirc;k 2,2 infile</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. The following command sorts,
in reverse order, the contents of infile1 and infile2,
placing the output in outfile and using the second character
of the second field as the <br>
sort key (assuming that the first character of the second
field is the field separator):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sort &acirc;r &acirc;o outfile
&acirc;k 2.2,2.2 infile1 infile2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. The following command sorts
the contents of infile1 and infile2 using the second
non-&lt;blank&gt; of the second field as the sort key:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sort &acirc;k 2.2b,2.2b infile1
infile2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. The following command prints
the System V password file (user database) sorted by the
numeric user ID (the third &lt;colon&gt;-separated
field):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sort &acirc;t : &acirc;k 3,3n
/etc/passwd</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5. The following command prints
the lines of the already sorted file infile, suppressing all
but one occurrence of lines having the same third field:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sort &acirc;um &acirc;k 3.1,3.0
infile</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RATIONALE <br>
Examples in some historical documentation state that options
&acirc;um with one input file keep the first in each set of
lines with equal keys. This behavior was deemed to be an
imple&acirc; <br>
mentation artifact and was not standardized.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &acirc;z option was omitted;
it is not standard practice on most systems and is
inconsistent with using sort to sort several files
individually and then merge them together. The <br>
text concerning &acirc;z in historical documentation
appeared to require implementations to determine the proper
buffer length during the sort phase of operation, but not
during the <br>
merge.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &acirc;y option was omitted
because of non-portability. The &acirc;M option, present in
System V, was omitted because of non-portability in
international usage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An undocumented &acirc;T option
exists in some implementations. It is used to specify a
directory for intermediate files. Implementations are
encouraged to support the use of the <br>
TMPDIR environment variable instead of adding an option to
support this functionality.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &acirc;k option was added to
satisfy two objections. First, the zero-based counting used
by sort is not consistent with other utility conventions.
Second, it did not meet syntax <br>
guideline requirements.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Historical documentation
indicates that &lsquo;&lsquo;setting &acirc;n implies
&acirc;b&rsquo;&rsquo;. The description of &acirc;n already
states that optional leading &lt;blank&gt;s are tolerated in
doing the comparison. If <br>
&acirc;b is enabled, rather than implied, by &acirc;n, this
has unusual side-effects. When a character offset is used in
a column of numbers (for example, to sort modulo 100), that
offset is <br>
measured relative to the most significant digit, not to the
column. Based upon a recommendation from the author of the
original sort utility, the &acirc;b implication has been
omitted <br>
from this volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008, and an application
wishing to achieve the previously mentioned side-effects has
to code the &acirc;b flag explicitly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Earlier versions of this
standard allowed the &acirc;o option to appear after
operands. Historical practice allowed all options to be
interspersed with operands. This version of the <br>
standard allows implementations to accept options after
operands but conforming applications should not use this
form.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Earlier versions of this
standard also allowed the &acirc;number and +number options.
These options are no longer specified by POSIX.1&acirc;2008
but may be present in some implementations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Historical implementations
produced a message on standard error when &acirc;c was
specified and disorder was detected, and when &acirc;c and
&acirc;u were specified and a duplicate key was <br>
detected. An earlier version of this standard contained
wording that did not make it clear that this message was
allowed and some implementations removed this message to be
sure <br>
that they conformed to the standard&rsquo;s requirements.
Confronted with this difference in behavior, interactive
users that wanted to be sure that they got visual feedback
instead of <br>
just exit code 1 could have used a command like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sort &acirc;c file || echo
disorder</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">whether or not the sort utility
provided a message in this case. But, it was not easy for a
user to find where the disorder or duplicate key occurred on
implementations that do <br>
not produce a message, especially when some parts of the
input line were not part of the key and when one or more of
the &acirc;b, &acirc;d, &acirc;f, &acirc;i, &acirc;n, or
&acirc;r options or keydef type modi&acirc; <br>
fiers were in use. POSIX.1&acirc;2008 requires a message to
be produced in this case. POSIX.1&acirc;2008 also contains
the &acirc;C option giving users the ability to choose
either behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a disorder or duplicate is
found when the &acirc;c option is specified, some
implementations print a message containing the first line
that is out of order or contains a duplicate <br>
key; others print a message specifying the line number of
the offending line. This standard allows either type of
message.</p>
