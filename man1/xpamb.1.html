<b>xpamb: the XPA Message Bus</b>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
The xpamb program can act as a &quot;classical&quot; message bus interface
  between clients and servers. A client can send a data request to the message
  bus, which then interfaces with multiple servers and returns the data back to
  the client.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
For xpaset, several optional switches are used to save data and manipulate the
  stored data:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>-data [name]</b>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Add the supplied data buffer to a pool of stored data buffers, using the
      specified name as a unique identifier for later retrieval. An error occurs
      if the name already exists (use either <b>replace</b> or <b>del</b> to
      rectify this). The <b>-add</b> switch is supported for backwards
      compatibility with xpa 2.0.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>-replace [name]</b>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Replace previously existing stored data having the same unique name with new
      data. This essentially is a combination of the <b>del</b> and <b>data</b>
      commands.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>-info [&quot;'info string'&quot;]</b>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    When adding a data buffer, you can specify an informational string to be
      stored with that data. This string will be returned by xpaget:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
  xpaget xpamb foo -info
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    (along with other information such as the date/time of storage and the size
      of the data buffer) if the -info switch is specified. If the info string
      contains spaces, you must enclose it in <b>two</b> sets of quotes:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
  cat foo | xpaset xpamb -store foo -info &quot;'this is info on foo'&quot;
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The first set of quotes is removed by the shell while the second is used to
      delineate the info string.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>-send [name]</b>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Broadcast the stored data buffer to the named template.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>-del [name]</b>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Delete the named data buffer and free all allocated space.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Switches can be used in any combination that makes sense. For example:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  cat foo.fits | xpaset xpamb -store foo -info &quot;FITS&quot; &quot;DS9:*&quot; fits foo.fits
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
will broadcast the foo.fits image to all access points of class <b>DS9</b>. In
  addition, the foo.fits file will be stored under the name of <b>foo</b> for
  later manipulation such as:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  xpaset -p xpamb -send foo &quot;DS9:*&quot; fits foo.fits
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
will re-broadcast the foo.fits image to all access points of class
  &quot;DS9&quot;.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
A &quot;classical&quot; message bus (such as ToolTalk) consists of servers and
  clients, along with a mediating program that transfers data between different
  processes. XPA takes a slightly different approach in that communication
  between clients and servers is direct. This generally is the correct technique
  when there is only one connection (or even a small number of connections), but
  can become inefficient for the serving program if a large amount of data is
  being transferred to many clients. For example, if a real-time data
  acquisition program is broadcasting a FITS image to several clients, it would
  need to transmit that image to each client individually. This might interfere
  with its own processing cycles. The preferable mechanism would be to pass the
  image off to an intermediate program that can then broadcast the data to the
  several clients.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>xpamb</b> program can alleviate such problems by functioning as a message
  bus in cases where such an intermediary process is wanted. It pre-defines a
  single access point named <b>XPAMB:xpamb</b> to which data can be sent for
  re-broadcast. You also can tell <b>xpamb</b> to save the data, and associate
  with that data a new access point, so that it can be retrieved later on.
<div class="Pp"></div>
All interaction with <b>xpamb</b> is performed through <b>xpaset</b> and
  <b>xpaget</b> (or the corresponding API routines,
  <b></b><b><i>XPASet()</i></b> <b></b> and
  <b></b><b><i>XPAGet()</i></b><b></b>) to the <b>XPAMB:xpamb</b> access point.
  That is, <b>xpamb</b> is just another XPA-enabled program that responds to
  requests from clients. The paramlist is used to specify the targets to which
  the data will be for re-broadcast, as well as the re-broadcast paramlist:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  data | xpaset xpamb [switches] broadcast-target broadcast-paramlist
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Optional switches are used to store data, and manipulate stored data, and are
  described below.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In its simplest form, you can, for example, send a FITS image to xpamb for
  broadcasting to all ds9 image simply by executing:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  cat foo.fits | xpaset xpamb &quot;DS9:*&quot; fits foo.fits
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Since <b>DS9</b> is the class name for the ds9 image display program, this will
  result in the FITS image being re-sent to all fits access points for all
  active image display programs.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can send stored data and new data to the same set of access points at the
  same time. The stored data always is send first, followed by the new data:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  cat foo2.fits | xpaset xpamb -send foo &quot;DS9:*&quot; fits foo.fits
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
will first send the foo.fits file, and then the foo2.fits file to all access
  points of class <b>DS9</b>. Notice that in this example, the foo2.fits file is
  not stored, but it could be stored by using the <b>-store [name]</b> switch on
  the command line.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>xpaget</b> command can be used to retrieve a data from XPA access points
  or from a stored data buffer, or retrieve information about a stored data
  buffer. If no arguments are given:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  xpaget xpamb
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
then information about all currently stored data buffers is returned. This
  information includes the data and time at which the data was stored, the size
  in bytes of the data, and the supplied info string.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If arguments are specified, they will be in the form:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  xpaget xpamb [-info] [-data] [name [paramlist]]
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the optional <b>-info</b> and/or <b>-data</b> switches are specified, then
  information and/or data will be returned for the named data buffer following
  the switches. You can use either or both of these switches in a single
  command. For example, if the -info switch is used:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  xpaget xpamb -info foo
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
then the info about that stored data buffer will be returned. If the -data is
  used with a specific name:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  xpaget xpamb -data foo
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
then the stored data itself will be returned. If both are used:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  xpaget xpamb -info -data foo
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
then the info will be returned, followed by the data. Note that it is an error
  to specify one of these switches without a data buffer name and that the
  paramlist will be ignored.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If neither the <b>-info</b> or <b>-data</b> switch is specified, then the name
  refers to an XPA access point (with an optional paramlist following). For
  example:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  xpaget xpamb ds9 file
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
is equivalent to:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  xpaget ds9 file
</pre>
