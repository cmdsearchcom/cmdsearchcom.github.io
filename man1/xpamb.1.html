<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
xpamb: the XPA Message Bus</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
The xpamb program can act as a &quot;classical&quot; message
bus interface between clients and servers. A client can send
a data request to the message bus, which then interfaces
with <br>
multiple servers and returns the data back to the
client.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
For xpaset, several optional switches are used to save data
and manipulate the stored data:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; -data [name]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Add the supplied data buffer to
a pool of stored data buffers, using the specified name as a
unique identifier for later retrieval. An error occurs if
the name already <br>
exists (use either replace or del to rectify this). The -add
switch is supported for backwards compatibility with xpa
2.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; -replace
[name]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Replace previously existing
stored data having the same unique name with new data. This
essentially is a combination of the del and data
commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; -info
[&quot;&rsquo;info string&rsquo;&quot;]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When adding a data buffer, you
can specify an informational string to be stored with that
data. This string will be returned by xpaget:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xpaget xpamb foo -info</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(along with other information
such as the date/time of storage and the size of the data
buffer) if the -info switch is specified. If the info string
contains spaces, you must <br>
enclose it in two sets of quotes:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cat foo | xpaset xpamb -store
foo -info &quot;&rsquo;this is info on foo&rsquo;&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first set of quotes is
removed by the shell while the second is used to delineate
the info string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; -send [name]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Broadcast the stored data buffer
to the named template.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; -del [name]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Delete the named data buffer and
free all allocated space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Switches can be used in any
combination that makes sense. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cat foo.fits | xpaset xpamb
-store foo -info &quot;FITS&quot; &quot;DS9:*&quot; fits
foo.fits</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will broadcast the foo.fits
image to all access points of class DS9. In addition, the
foo.fits file will be stored under the name of foo for later
manipulation such as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xpaset -p xpamb -send foo
&quot;DS9:*&quot; fits foo.fits</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will re-broadcast the foo.fits
image to all access points of class &quot;DS9&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
A &quot;classical&quot; message bus (such as ToolTalk)
consists of servers and clients, along with a mediating
program that transfers data between different processes. XPA
takes a slightly <br>
different approach in that communication between clients and
servers is direct. This generally is the correct technique
when there is only one connection (or even a small number
<br>
of connections), but can become inefficient for the serving
program if a large amount of data is being transferred to
many clients. For example, if a real-time data acquisition
<br>
program is broadcasting a FITS image to several clients, it
would need to transmit that image to each client
individually. This might interfere with its own processing
cycles. <br>
The preferable mechanism would be to pass the image off to
an intermediate program that can then broadcast the data to
the several clients.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The xpamb program can alleviate
such problems by functioning as a message bus in cases where
such an intermediary process is wanted. It pre-defines a
single access point named <br>
XPAMB:xpamb to which data can be sent for re-broadcast. You
also can tell xpamb to save the data, and associate with
that data a new access point, so that it can be retrieved
<br>
later on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All interaction with xpamb is
performed through xpaset and xpaget (or the corresponding
API routines, XPASet() and XPAGet()) to the XPAMB:xpamb
access point. That is, xpamb is <br>
just another XPA-enabled program that responds to requests
from clients. The paramlist is used to specify the targets
to which the data will be for re-broadcast, as well as the
<br>
re-broadcast paramlist:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">data | xpaset xpamb [switches]
broadcast-target broadcast-paramlist</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Optional switches are used to
store data, and manipulate stored data, and are described
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In its simplest form, you can,
for example, send a FITS image to xpamb for broadcasting to
all ds9 image simply by executing:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cat foo.fits | xpaset xpamb
&quot;DS9:*&quot; fits foo.fits</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since DS9 is the class name for
the ds9 image display program, this will result in the FITS
image being re-sent to all fits access points for all active
image display programs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can send stored data and new
data to the same set of access points at the same time. The
stored data always is send first, followed by the new
data:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cat foo2.fits | xpaset xpamb
-send foo &quot;DS9:*&quot; fits foo.fits</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will first send the foo.fits
file, and then the foo2.fits file to all access points of
class DS9. Notice that in this example, the foo2.fits file
is not stored, but it could be <br>
stored by using the -store [name] switch on the command
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The xpaget command can be used
to retrieve a data from XPA access points or from a stored
data buffer, or retrieve information about a stored data
buffer. If no arguments are <br>
given:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xpaget xpamb</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">then information about all
currently stored data buffers is returned. This information
includes the data and time at which the data was stored, the
size in bytes of the data, and <br>
the supplied info string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If arguments are specified, they
will be in the form:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xpaget xpamb [-info] [-data]
[name [paramlist]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the optional -info and/or
-data switches are specified, then information and/or data
will be returned for the named data buffer following the
switches. You can use either or <br>
both of these switches in a single command. For example, if
the -info switch is used:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xpaget xpamb -info foo</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">then the info about that stored
data buffer will be returned. If the -data is used with a
specific name:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xpaget xpamb -data foo</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">then the stored data itself will
be returned. If both are used:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xpaget xpamb -info -data foo</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">then the info will be returned,
followed by the data. Note that it is an error to specify
one of these switches without a data buffer name and that
the paramlist will be ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If neither the -info or -data
switch is specified, then the name refers to an XPA access
point (with an optional paramlist following). For
example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xpaget xpamb ds9 file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">is equivalent to:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xpaget ds9 file</p>
