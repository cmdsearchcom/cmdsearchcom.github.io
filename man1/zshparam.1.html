<p>ZSHPARAM(1) General Commands Manual ZSHPARAM(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
zshparam - zsh parameters</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
A parameter has a name, a value, and a number of attributes.
A name may be any sequence of alphanumeric characters and
underscores, or the single characters &lsquo;*&rsquo;,
&lsquo;@&rsquo;, &lsquo;#&rsquo;, &lsquo;?&rsquo;, <br>
&lsquo;-&rsquo;, &lsquo;$&rsquo;, or &lsquo;!&rsquo;. The
value may be a scalar (a string), an integer, an array
(indexed numerically), or an associative array (an unordered
set of name-value pairs, indexed by <br>
name). To declare the type of a parameter, or to assign a
scalar or integer value to a parameter, use the typeset
builtin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The value of a scalar or integer
parameter may also be assigned by writing:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">name=value</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the integer attribute, -i, is
set for name, the value is subject to arithmetic evaluation.
Furthermore, by replacing &lsquo;=&rsquo; with
&lsquo;+=&rsquo;, a parameter can be added or appended to.
<br>
See the section &lsquo;Array Parameters&rsquo; for
additional forms of assignment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To refer to the value of a
parameter, write &lsquo;$name&rsquo; or
&lsquo;${name}&rsquo;. See Parameter Expansion in zshexpn(1)
for complete details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the parameter lists that
follow, the mark &lsquo;&lt;S&gt;&rsquo; indicates that the
parameter is special. Special parameters cannot have their
type changed or their readonly attribute turned <br>
off, and if a special parameter is unset, then later
recreated, the special properties will be retained.
&lsquo;&lt;Z&gt;&rsquo; indicates that the parameter does
not exist when the shell ini&acirc; <br>
tializes in sh or ksh emulation mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ARRAY PARAMETERS <br>
To assign an array value, write one of:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set -A name value ... <br>
name=(value ...)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no parameter name exists, an
ordinary array parameter is created. If the parameter name
exists and is a scalar, it is replaced by a new array.
Ordinary array parameters may <br>
also be explicitly declared with:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">typeset -a name</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Associative arrays must be
declared before assignment, by using:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">typeset -A name</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When name refers to an
associative array, the list in an assignment is interpreted
as alternating keys and values:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set -A name key value ... <br>
name=(key value ...)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Every key must have a value in
this case. Note that this assigns to the entire array,
deleting any elements that do not appear in the list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To create an empty array
(including associative arrays), use one of:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set -A name <br>
name=()</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Array Subscripts <br>
Individual elements of an array may be selected using a
subscript. A subscript of the form &lsquo;[exp]&rsquo;
selects the single element exp, where exp is an arithmetic
expression which <br>
will be subject to arithmetic expansion as if it were
surrounded by &lsquo;$((...))&rsquo;. The elements are
numbered beginning with 1, unless the KSH_ARRAYS option is
set in which case <br>
they are numbered from zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Subscripts may be used inside
braces used to delimit a parameter name, thus
&lsquo;${foo[2]}&rsquo; is equivalent to
&lsquo;$foo[2]&rsquo;. If the KSH_ARRAYS option is set, the
braced form is the only <br>
one that works, as bracketed expressions otherwise are not
treated as subscripts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the KSH_ARRAYS option is not
set, then by default accesses to an array element with a
subscript that evaluates to zero return an empty string,
while an attempt to write such <br>
an element is treated as an error. For backward
compatibility the KSH_ZERO_SUBSCRIPT option can be set to
cause subscript values 0 and 1 to be equivalent; see the
description of <br>
the option in zshoptions(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The same subscripting syntax is
used for associative arrays, except that no arithmetic
expansion is applied to exp. However, the parsing rules for
arithmetic expressions still <br>
apply, which affects the way that certain special characters
must be protected from interpretation. See Subscript Parsing
below for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A subscript of the form
&lsquo;[*]&rsquo; or &lsquo;[@]&rsquo; evaluates to all
elements of an array; there is no difference between the two
except when they appear within double quotes.
&lsquo;&quot;$foo[*]&quot;&rsquo; <br>
evaluates to &lsquo;&quot;$foo[1] $foo[2] ...&quot;&rsquo;,
whereas &lsquo;&quot;$foo[@]&quot;&rsquo; evaluates to
&lsquo;&quot;$foo[1]&quot; &quot;$foo[2]&quot; ...&rsquo;.
For associative arrays, &lsquo;[*]&rsquo; or
&lsquo;[@]&rsquo; evaluate to all the values, in no
par&acirc; <br>
ticular order. Note that this does not substitute the keys;
see the documentation for the &lsquo;k&rsquo; flag under
Parameter Expansion Flags in zshexpn(1) for complete
details. When an <br>
array parameter is referenced as &lsquo;$name&rsquo; (with
no subscript) it evaluates to &lsquo;$name[*]&rsquo;, unless
the KSH_ARRAYS option is set in which case it evaluates to
&lsquo;${name[0]}&rsquo; (for an <br>
associative array, this means the value of the key
&lsquo;0&rsquo;, which may not exist even if there are
values for other keys).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A subscript of the form
&lsquo;[exp1,exp2]&rsquo; selects all elements in the range
exp1 to exp2, inclusive. (Associative arrays are unordered,
and so do not support ranges.) If one of the <br>
subscripts evaluates to a negative number, say -n, then the
nth element from the end of the array is used. Thus
&lsquo;$foo[-3]&rsquo; is the third element from the end of
the array foo, <br>
and &lsquo;$foo[1,-1]&rsquo; is the same as
&lsquo;$foo[*]&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Subscripting may also be
performed on non-array values, in which case the subscripts
specify a substring to be extracted. For example, if FOO is
set to &lsquo;foobar&rsquo;, then &lsquo;echo <br>
$FOO[2,5]&rsquo; prints &lsquo;ooba&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Array Element Assignment <br>
A subscript may be used on the left side of an assignment
like so:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">name[exp]=value</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In this form of assignment the
element or range specified by exp is replaced by the
expression on the right side. An array (but not an
associative array) may be created by <br>
assignment to a range or element. Arrays do not nest, so
assigning a parenthesized list of values to an element or
range changes the number of elements in the array, shifting
<br>
the other elements to accommodate the new values. (This is
not supported for associative arrays.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This syntax also works as an
argument to the typeset command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">typeset
&quot;name[exp]&quot;=value</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The value may not be a
parenthesized list in this case; only single-element
assignments may be made with typeset. Note that quotes are
necessary in this case to prevent the <br>
brackets from being interpreted as filename generation
operators. The noglob precommand modifier could be used
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To delete an element of an
ordinary array, assign &lsquo;()&rsquo; to that element. To
delete an element of an associative array, use the unset
command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unset &quot;name[exp]&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Subscript Flags <br>
If the opening bracket, or the comma in a range, in any
subscript expression is directly followed by an opening
parenthesis, the string up to the matching closing one is
consid&acirc; <br>
ered to be a list of flags, as in
&lsquo;name[(flags)exp]&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The flags s, n and b take an
argument; the delimiter is shown below as &lsquo;:&rsquo;,
but any character, or the matching pairs
&lsquo;(...)&rsquo;, &lsquo;{...}&rsquo;,
&lsquo;[...]&rsquo;, or &lsquo;&lt;...&gt;&rsquo;, may be
used, but note <br>
that &lsquo;&lt;...&gt;&rsquo; can only be used if the
subscript is inside a double quoted expression or a
parameter substitution enclosed in braces as otherwise the
expression is interpreted as a <br>
redirection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The flags currently understood
are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">w If the parameter subscripted
is a scalar then this flag makes subscripting work on words
instead of characters. The default word separator is
whitespace. This flag may <br>
not be used with the i or I flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">s:string: <br>
This gives the string that separates words (for use with the
w flag). The delimiter character : is arbitrary; see
above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">p Recognize the same escape
sequences as the print builtin in the string argument of a
subsequent &lsquo;s&rsquo; flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f If the parameter subscripted
is a scalar then this flag makes subscripting work on lines
instead of characters, i.e. with elements separated by
newlines. This is a short&acirc; <br>
hand for &lsquo;pws:0&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">r Reverse subscripting: if this
flag is given, the exp is taken as a pattern and the result
is the first matching array element, substring or word (if
the parameter is an <br>
array, if it is a scalar, or if it is a scalar and the
&lsquo;w&rsquo; flag is given, respectively). The subscript
used is the number of the matching element, so that pairs of
sub&acirc; <br>
scripts such as &lsquo;$foo[(r)??,3]&rsquo; and
&lsquo;$foo[(r)??,(r)f*]&rsquo; are possible if the
parameter is not an associative array. If the parameter is
an associative array, only the <br>
value part of each pair is compared to the pattern, and the
result is that value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a search through an ordinary
array failed, the search sets the subscript to one past the
end of the array, and hence ${array[(r)pattern]} will
substitute the empty <br>
string. Thus the success of a search can be tested by using
the (i) flag, for example (assuming the option KSH_ARRAYS is
not in effect):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[[ ${array[(i)pattern]} -le
${#array} ]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If KSH_ARRAYS is in effect, the
-le should be replaced by -lt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">R Like &lsquo;r&rsquo;, but
gives the last match. For associative arrays, gives all
possible matches. May be used for assigning to ordinary
array elements, but not for assigning to <br>
associative arrays. On failure, for normal arrays this has
the effect of returning the element corresponding to
subscript 0; this is empty unless one of the options <br>
KSH_ARRAYS or KSH_ZERO_SUBSCRIPT is in effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that in subscripts with
both &lsquo;r&rsquo; and &lsquo;R&rsquo; pattern characters
are active even if they were substituted for a parameter
(regardless of the setting of GLOB_SUBST which <br>
controls this feature in normal pattern matching). The flag
&lsquo;e&rsquo; can be added to inhibit pattern matching. As
this flag does not inhibit other forms of substitution, care
<br>
is still required; using a parameter to hold the key has the
desired effect:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">key2=&rsquo;original key&rsquo;
<br>
print ${array[(Re)$key2]}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">i Like &lsquo;r&rsquo;, but
gives the index of the match instead; this may not be
combined with a second argument. On the left side of an
assignment, behaves like &lsquo;r&rsquo;. For associative
<br>
arrays, the key part of each pair is compared to the
pattern, and the first matching key found is the result. On
failure substitutes the length of the array plus one, as
<br>
discussed under the description of &lsquo;r&rsquo;, or the
empty string for an associative array.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">I Like &lsquo;i&rsquo;, but
gives the index of the last match, or all possible matching
keys in an associative array. On failure substitutes 0, or
the empty string for an associative <br>
array. This flag is best when testing for values or keys
that do not exist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">k If used in a subscript on an
associative array, this flag causes the keys to be
interpreted as patterns, and returns the value for the first
key found where exp is matched <br>
by the key. Note this could be any such key as no ordering
of associative arrays is defined. This flag does not work on
the left side of an assignment to an associative <br>
array element. If used on another type of parameter, this
behaves like &lsquo;r&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">K On an associative array this
is like &lsquo;k&rsquo; but returns all values where exp is
matched by the keys. On other types of parameters this has
the same effect as &lsquo;R&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">n:expr: <br>
If combined with &lsquo;r&rsquo;, &lsquo;R&rsquo;,
&lsquo;i&rsquo; or &lsquo;I&rsquo;, makes them give the nth
or nth last match (if expr evaluates to n). This flag is
ignored when the array is associative. The delim&acirc; <br>
iter character : is arbitrary; see above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">b:expr: <br>
If combined with &lsquo;r&rsquo;, &lsquo;R&rsquo;,
&lsquo;i&rsquo; or &lsquo;I&rsquo;, makes them begin at the
nth or nth last element, word, or character (if expr
evaluates to n). This flag is ignored when the array <br>
is associative. The delimiter character : is arbitrary; see
above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">e This flag causes any pattern
matching that would be performed on the subscript to use
plain string matching instead. Hence
&lsquo;${array[(re)*]}&rsquo; matches only the array
ele&acirc; <br>
ment whose value is *. Note that other forms of substitution
such as parameter substitution are not inhibited.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This flag can also be used to
force * or @ to be interpreted as a single key rather than
as a reference to all values. It may be used for either
purpose on the left side <br>
of an assignment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See Parameter Expansion Flags
(zshexpn(1)) for additional ways to manipulate the results
of array subscripting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Subscript Parsing <br>
This discussion applies mainly to associative array key
strings and to patterns used for reverse subscripting (the
&lsquo;r&rsquo;, &lsquo;R&rsquo;, &lsquo;i&rsquo;, etc.
flags), but it may also affect parameter <br>
substitutions that appear as part of an arithmetic
expression in an ordinary subscript.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is possible to avoid the use
of subscripts in assignments to associative array elements
by using the syntax:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">aa+=(&rsquo;key with
&quot;*strange*&quot; characters&rsquo; &rsquo;value
string&rsquo;)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This adds a new key/value pair
if the key is not already present, and replaces the value
for the existing key if it is.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The basic rule to remember when
writing a subscript expression is that all text between the
opening &lsquo;[&rsquo; and the closing &lsquo;]&rsquo; is
interpreted as if it were in double quotes (see <br>
zshmisc(1)). However, unlike double quotes which normally
cannot nest, subscript expressions may appear inside
double-quoted strings or inside other subscript expressions
(or <br>
both!), so the rules have two important differences.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first difference is that
brackets (&lsquo;[&rsquo; and &lsquo;]&rsquo;) must appear
as balanced pairs in a subscript expression unless they are
preceded by a backslash (&lsquo;&acute;). Therefore, within
a <br>
subscript expression (and unlike true double-quoting) the
sequence &lsquo;&rsquo; becomes &lsquo;]&rsquo;. This
applies even in cases where a backslash is not normally <br>
required; for example, the pattern &lsquo;[^[]&rsquo; (to
match any character other than an open bracket) should be
written &lsquo;[^&rsquo; in a reverse-subscript pattern.
However, note that <br>
&lsquo;&rsquo; and even &lsquo;&rsquo; mean the same thing,
because backslashes are always stripped when they appear
before brackets!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The same rule applies to
parentheses (&lsquo;(&rsquo; and &lsquo;)&rsquo;) and braces
(&lsquo;{&rsquo; and &lsquo;}&rsquo;): they must appear
either in balanced pairs or preceded by a backslash, and
backslashes that protect <br>
parentheses or braces are removed during parsing. This is
because parameter expansions may be surrounded by balanced
braces, and subscript flags are introduced by balanced <br>
parentheses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The second difference is that a
double-quote (&lsquo;&quot;&rsquo;) may appear as part of a
subscript expression without being preceded by a backslash,
and therefore that the two characters &lsquo; <br>
remain as two characters in the subscript (in true
double-quoting, &lsquo; <br>
occur in balanced pairs unless preceded by a backslash. This
makes it more difficult to write a subscript expression that
contains an odd number of double-quote characters, but <br>
the reason for this difference is so that when a subscript
expression appears inside true double-quotes, one can still
write &lsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To use an odd number of double
quotes as a key in an assignment, use the typeset builtin
and an enclosing pair of double quotes; to refer to the
value of that key, again use dou&acirc; <br>
ble quotes:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">typeset -A aa <br>
typeset &quot;aa[one <br>
print &quot;$aa[one</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is important to note that the
quoting rules do not change when a parameter expansion with
a subscript is nested inside another subscript expression.
That is, it is not neces&acirc; <br>
sary to use additional backslashes within the inner
subscript expression; they are removed only once, from the
innermost subscript outwards. Parameters are also expanded
from <br>
the innermost subscript first, as each expansion is
encountered left to right in the outer expression.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A further complication arises
from a way in which subscript parsing is not different from
double quote parsing. As in true double-quoting, the
sequences &lsquo;, and &lsquo;@&rsquo; remain as <br>
two characters when they appear in a subscript expression.
To use a literal &lsquo;*&rsquo; or &lsquo;@&rsquo; as an
associative array key, the &lsquo;e&rsquo; flag must be
used:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">typeset -A aa <br>
aa[(e)*]=star <br>
print $aa[(e)*]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A last detail must be considered
when reverse subscripting is performed. Parameters appearing
in the subscript expression are first expanded and then the
complete expression is <br>
interpreted as a pattern. This has two effects: first,
parameters behave as if GLOB_SUBST were on (and it cannot be
turned off); second, backslashes are interpreted twice, once
<br>
when parsing the array subscript and again when parsing the
pattern. In a reverse subscript, it&rsquo;s necessary to use
four backslashes to cause a single backslash to match
liter&acirc; <br>
ally in the pattern. For complex patterns, it is often
easiest to assign the desired pattern to a parameter and
then refer to that parameter in the subscript, because then
the <br>
backslashes, brackets, parentheses, etc., are seen only when
the complete expression is converted to a pattern. To match
the value of a parameter literally in a reverse sub&acirc;
<br>
script, rather than as a pattern, use
&lsquo;${(q)name}&rsquo; (see zshexpn(1)) to quote the
expanded value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the &lsquo;k&rsquo;
and &lsquo;K&rsquo; flags are reverse subscripting for an
ordinary array, but are not reverse subscripting for an
associative array! (For an associative array, the keys in
<br>
the array itself are interpreted as patterns by those flags;
the subscript is a plain string in that case.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One final note, not directly
related to subscripting: the numeric names of positional
parameters (described below) are parsed specially, so for
example &lsquo;$2foo&rsquo; is equivalent to <br>
&lsquo;${2}foo&rsquo;. Therefore, to use subscript syntax to
extract a substring from a positional parameter, the
expansion must be surrounded by braces; for example,
&lsquo;${2[3,5]}&rsquo; evaluates <br>
to the third through fifth characters of the second
positional parameter, but &lsquo;$2[3,5]&rsquo; is the
entire second parameter concatenated with the filename
generation pattern &lsquo;[3,5]&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">POSITIONAL PARAMETERS <br>
The positional parameters provide access to the command-line
arguments of a shell function, shell script, or the shell
itself; see the section &lsquo;Invocation&rsquo;, and also
the section <br>
&lsquo;Functions&rsquo;. The parameter n, where n is a
number, is the nth positional parameter. The parameters *, @
and argv are arrays containing all the positional
parameters; thus <br>
&lsquo;$argv[n]&rsquo;, etc., is equivalent to simply
&lsquo;$n&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Positional parameters may be
changed after the shell or function starts by using the set
builtin, by assigning to the argv array, or by direct
assignment of the form &lsquo;n=value&rsquo; <br>
where n is the number of the positional parameter to be
changed. This also creates (with empty values) any of the
positions from 1 to n that do not already have values. Note
<br>
that, because the positional parameters form an array, an
array assignment of the form &lsquo;n=(value ...)&rsquo; is
allowed, and has the effect of shifting all the values at
positions <br>
greater than n by as many positions as necessary to
accommodate the new values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LOCAL PARAMETERS <br>
Shell function executions delimit scopes for shell
parameters. (Parameters are dynamically scoped.) The typeset
builtin, and its alternative forms declare, integer, local
and <br>
readonly (but not export), can be used to declare a
parameter as being local to the innermost scope.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a parameter is read or
assigned to, the innermost existing parameter of that name
is used. (That is, the local parameter hides any less-local
parameter.) However, assign&acirc; <br>
ing to a non-existent parameter, or declaring a new
parameter with export, causes it to be created in the
outermost scope.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Local parameters disappear when
their scope ends. unset can be used to delete a parameter
while it is still in scope; any outer parameter of the same
name remains hidden.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Special parameters may also be
made local; they retain their special attributes unless
either the existing or the newly-created parameter has the
-h (hide) attribute. This may <br>
have unexpected effects: there is no default value, so if
there is no assignment at the point the variable is made
local, it will be set to an empty value (or zero in the case
of <br>
integers). The following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">typeset
PATH=/new/directory:$PATH</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">is valid for temporarily
allowing the shell or programmes called from it to find the
programs in /new/directory inside a function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the restriction in
older versions of zsh that local parameters were never
exported has been removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PARAMETERS SET BY THE SHELL <br>
The following parameters are automatically set by the
shell:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">! &lt;S&gt; The process ID of
the last command started in the background with &amp;, or
put into the background with the bg builtin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># &lt;S&gt; The number of
positional parameters in decimal. Note that some confusion
may occur with the syntax $#param which substitutes the
length of param. Use ${#} to resolve <br>
ambiguities. In particular, the sequence
&lsquo;$#-...&rsquo; in an arithmetic expression is
interpreted as the length of the parameter -, q.v.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ARGC &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt; <br>
Same as #.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ &lt;S&gt; The process ID of
this shell. Note that this indicates the original shell
started by invoking zsh; all processes forked from the
shells without executing a new program, <br>
such as subshells started by (...), substitute the same
value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- &lt;S&gt; Flags supplied to
the shell on invocation or by the set or setopt
commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* &lt;S&gt; An array containing
the positional parameters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">argv &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt; <br>
Same as *. Assigning to argv changes the local positional
parameters, but argv is not itself a local parameter.
Deleting argv with unset in any function deletes it <br>
everywhere, although only the innermost positional parameter
array is deleted (so * and @ in other scopes are not
affected).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@ &lt;S&gt; Same as argv[@],
even when argv is not set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">? &lt;S&gt; The exit status
returned by the last command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 &lt;S&gt; The name used to
invoke the current shell. If the FUNCTION_ARGZERO option is
set, this is set temporarily within a shell function to the
name of the function, and within <br>
a sourced script to the name of the script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">status &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt; <br>
Same as ?.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pipestatus &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt;
<br>
An array containing the exit statuses returned by all
commands in the last pipeline.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">_ &lt;S&gt; The last argument of
the previous command. Also, this parameter is set in the
environment of every command executed to the full pathname
of the command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CPUTYPE <br>
The machine type (microprocessor class or machine model), as
determined at run time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EGID &lt;S&gt; <br>
The effective group ID of the shell process. If you have
sufficient privileges, you may change the effective group ID
of the shell process by assigning to this parameter. <br>
Also (assuming sufficient privileges), you may start a
single command with a different effective group ID by
&lsquo;(EGID=gid; command)&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EUID &lt;S&gt; <br>
The effective user ID of the shell process. If you have
sufficient privileges, you may change the effective user ID
of the shell process by assigning to this parameter. <br>
Also (assuming sufficient privileges), you may start a
single command with a different effective user ID by
&lsquo;(EUID=uid; command)&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ERRNO &lt;S&gt; <br>
The value of errno (see errno(3)) as set by the most
recently failed system call. This value is system dependent
and is intended for debugging purposes. It is also
use&acirc; <br>
ful with the zsh/system module which allows the number to be
turned into a name or message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GID &lt;S&gt; <br>
The real group ID of the shell process. If you have
sufficient privileges, you may change the group ID of the
shell process by assigning to this parameter. Also
(assum&acirc; <br>
ing sufficient privileges), you may start a single command
under a different group ID by &lsquo;(GID=gid;
command)&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTCMD <br>
The current history line number in an interactive shell, in
other words the line number for the command that caused
$HISTCMD to be read.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOST The current hostname.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LINENO &lt;S&gt; <br>
The line number of the current line within the current
script, sourced file, or shell function being executed,
whichever was started most recently. Note that in the case
<br>
of shell functions the line number refers to the function as
it appeared in the original definition, not necessarily as
displayed by the functions builtin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LOGNAME <br>
If the corresponding variable is not set in the environment
of the shell, it is initialized to the login name
corresponding to the current login session. This parameter
is <br>
exported by default but this can be disabled using the
typeset builtin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MACHTYPE <br>
The machine type (microprocessor class or machine model), as
determined at compile time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OLDPWD The previous working
directory. This is set when the shell initializes and
whenever the directory changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTARG &lt;S&gt; <br>
The value of the last option argument processed by the
getopts command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIND &lt;S&gt; <br>
The index of the last option argument processed by the
getopts command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OSTYPE The operating system, as
determined at compile time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PPID &lt;S&gt; <br>
The process ID of the parent of the shell. As for $$, the
value indicates the parent of the original shell and does
not change in subshells.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PWD The present working
directory. This is set when the shell initializes and
whenever the directory changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RANDOM &lt;S&gt; <br>
A pseudo-random integer from 0 to 32767, newly generated
each time this parameter is referenced. The random number
generator can be seeded by assigning a numeric value to <br>
RANDOM.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The values of RANDOM form an
intentionally-repeatable pseudo-random sequence; subshells
that reference RANDOM will result in identical pseudo-random
values unless the <br>
value of RANDOM is referenced or seeded in the parent shell
in between subshell invocations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SECONDS &lt;S&gt; <br>
The number of seconds since shell invocation. If this
parameter is assigned a value, then the value returned upon
reference will be the value that was assigned plus the <br>
number of seconds since the assignment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unlike other special parameters,
the type of the SECONDS parameter can be changed using the
typeset command. Only integer and one of the floating point
types are allowed. <br>
For example, &lsquo;typeset -F SECONDS&rsquo; causes the
value to be reported as a floating point number. The value
is available to microsecond accuracy, although the shell may
show <br>
more or fewer digits depending on the use of typeset. See
the documentation for the builtin typeset in zshbuiltins(1)
for more details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SHLVL &lt;S&gt; <br>
Incremented by one each time a new shell is started.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">signals <br>
An array containing the names of the signals.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TRY_BLOCK_ERROR &lt;S&gt; <br>
In an always block, indicates whether the preceding list of
code caused an error. The value is 1 to indicate an error, 0
otherwise. It may be reset, clearing the error <br>
condition. See Complex Commands in zshmisc(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TTY The name of the tty
associated with the shell, if any.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TTYIDLE &lt;S&gt; <br>
The idle time of the tty associated with the shell in
seconds or -1 if there is no such tty.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UID &lt;S&gt; <br>
The real user ID of the shell process. If you have
sufficient privileges, you may change the user ID of the
shell by assigning to this parameter. Also (assuming
suffi&acirc; <br>
cient privileges), you may start a single command under a
different user ID by &lsquo;(UID=uid; command)&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USERNAME &lt;S&gt; <br>
The username corresponding to the real user ID of the shell
process. If you have sufficient privileges, you may change
the username (and also the user ID and group ID) of <br>
the shell by assigning to this parameter. Also (assuming
sufficient privileges), you may start a single command under
a different username (and user ID and group ID) by <br>
&lsquo;(USERNAME=username; command)&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VENDOR The vendor, as determined
at compile time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zsh_eval_context &lt;S&gt;
&lt;Z&gt; (ZSH_EVAL_CONTEXT &lt;S&gt;) <br>
An array (colon-separated list) indicating the context of
shell code that is being run. Each time a piece of shell
code that is stored within the shell is executed a <br>
string is temporarily appended to the array to indicate the
type of operation that is being performed. Read in order the
array gives an indication of the stack of opera&acirc; <br>
tions being performed with the most immediate context
last.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the variable does not
give information on syntactic context such as pipelines or
subshells. Use $ZSH_SUBSHELL to detect subshells.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The context is one of the
following: <br>
cmdarg Code specified by the -c option to the command line
that invoked the shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cmdsubst <br>
Command substitution using the &lsquo;...&lsquo; or $(...)
construct.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">equalsubst <br>
File substitution using the =(...) construct.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">eval Code executed by the eval
builtin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">evalautofunc <br>
Code executed with the KSH_AUTOLOAD mechanism in order to
define an autoloaded function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fc Code from the shell history
executed by the -e option to the fc builtin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file Lines of code being read
directly from a file, for example by the source builtin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">filecode <br>
Lines of code being read from a .zwc file instead of
directly from the source file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">globqual <br>
Code executed by the e or + glob qualifier.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">globsort <br>
Code executed to order files by the o glob qualifier.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">insubst <br>
File substitution using the &lt;(...) construct.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">loadautofunc <br>
Code read directly from a file to define an autoloaded
function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">outsubst <br>
File substitution using the &gt;(...) construct.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sched Code executed by the sched
builtin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">shfunc A shell function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">stty Code passed to stty by the
STTY environment variable. Normally this is passed directly
to the system&rsquo;s stty command, so this value is
unlikely to be seen in prac&acirc; <br>
tice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">style Code executed as part of a
style retrieved by the zstyle builtin from the zsh/zutil
module.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">toplevel <br>
The highest execution level of a script or interactive
shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">trap Code executed as a trap
defined by the trap builtin. Traps defined as functions have
the context shfunc. As traps are asynchronous they may have
a different hier&acirc; <br>
archy from other code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zpty Code executed by the zpty
builtin from the zsh/zpty module.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zregexparse-guard <br>
Code executed as a guard by the zregexparse command from the
zsh/zutil module.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zregexparse-action <br>
Code executed as an action by the zregexparse command from
the zsh/zutil module.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ZSH_NAME <br>
Expands to the basename of the command used to invoke this
instance of zsh.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ZSH_PATCHLEVEL <br>
The revision string for the version number of the ChangeLog
file in the zsh distribution. This is most useful in order
to keep track of versions of the shell during <br>
development between releases; hence most users should not
use it and should instead rely on $ZSH_VERSION.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zsh_scheduled_events <br>
See the section &lsquo;The zsh/sched Module&rsquo; in
zshmodules(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ZSH_SUBSHELL <br>
Readonly integer. Initially zero, incremented each time the
shell forks to create a subshell for executing code. Hence
&lsquo;(print $ZSH_SUBSHELL)&rsquo; and &lsquo;print $(print
<br>
$ZSH_SUBSHELL)&rsquo; output 1, while &lsquo;( (print
$ZSH_SUBSHELL) )&rsquo; outputs 2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ZSH_VERSION <br>
The version number of the release of zsh.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PARAMETERS USED BY THE SHELL
<br>
The following parameters are used by the shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In cases where there are two
parameters with an upper- and lowercase form of the same
name, such as path and PATH, the lowercase form is an array
and the uppercase form is a <br>
scalar with the elements of the array joined together by
colons. These are similar to tied parameters created via
&lsquo;typeset -T&rsquo;. The normal use for the
colon-separated form is <br>
for exporting to the environment, while the array form is
easier to manipulate within the shell. Note that unsetting
either of the pair will unset the other; they retain their
<br>
special properties when recreated, and recreating one of the
pair will recreate the other.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ARGV0 If exported, its value is
used as the argv[0] of external commands. Usually used in
constructs like &lsquo;ARGV0=emacs nethack&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BAUD The rate in bits per second
at which data reaches the terminal. The line editor will use
this value in order to compensate for a slow terminal by
delaying updates to the <br>
display until necessary. If the parameter is unset or the
value is zero the compensation mechanism is turned off. The
parameter is not set by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This parameter may be profitably
set in some circumstances, e.g. for slow modems dialing into
a communications server, or on a slow wide area network. It
should be set <br>
to the baud rate of the slowest part of the link for best
performance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cdpath &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt;
(CDPATH &lt;S&gt;) <br>
An array (colon-separated list) of directories specifying
the search path for the cd command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COLUMNS &lt;S&gt; <br>
The number of columns for this terminal session. Used for
printing select lists and for the line editor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CORRECT_IGNORE <br>
If set, is treated as a pattern during spelling correction.
Any potential correction that matches the pattern is
ignored. For example, if the value is &lsquo;_*&rsquo; then
comple&acirc; <br>
tion functions (which, by convention, have names beginning
with &lsquo;_&rsquo;) will never be offered as spelling
corrections. The pattern does not apply to the correction of
file <br>
names, as applied by the CORRECT_ALL option (so with the
example just given files beginning with &lsquo;_&rsquo; in
the current directory would still be completed).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIRSTACKSIZE <br>
The maximum size of the directory stack, by default there is
no limit. If the stack gets larger than this, it will be
truncated automatically. This is useful with the <br>
AUTO_PUSHD option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENV If the ENV environment
variable is set when zsh is invoked as sh or ksh, $ENV is
sourced after the profile scripts. The value of ENV is
subjected to parameter expansion, <br>
command substitution, and arithmetic expansion before being
interpreted as a pathname. Note that ENV is not used unless
zsh is emulating sh or ksh.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FCEDIT The default editor for
the fc builtin. If FCEDIT is not set, the parameter EDITOR
is used; if that is not set either, a builtin default,
usually vi, is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fignore &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt;
(FIGNORE &lt;S&gt;) <br>
An array (colon separated list) containing the suffixes of
files to be ignored during filename completion. However, if
completion only generates files with suffixes in <br>
this list, then these files are completed anyway.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fpath &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt; (FPATH
&lt;S&gt;) <br>
An array (colon separated list) of directories specifying
the search path for function definitions. This path is
searched when a function with the -u attribute is
refer&acirc; <br>
enced. If an executable file is found, then it is read and
executed in the current environment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">histchars &lt;S&gt; <br>
Three characters used by the shell&rsquo;s history and
lexical analysis mechanism. The first character signals the
start of a history expansion (default &lsquo;!&rsquo;). The
second char&acirc; <br>
acter signals the start of a quick history substitution
(default &lsquo;^&rsquo;). The third character is the
comment character (default &lsquo;#&rsquo;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The characters must be in the
ASCII character set; any attempt to set histchars to
characters with a locale-dependent meaning will be rejected
with an error message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTCHARS &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt;
<br>
Same as histchars. (Deprecated.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTFILE <br>
The file to save the history in when an interactive shell
exits. If unset, the history is not saved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTSIZE &lt;S&gt; <br>
The maximum number of events stored in the internal history
list. If you use the HIST_EXPIRE_DUPS_FIRST option, setting
this value larger than the SAVEHIST size will give <br>
you the difference as a cushion for saving duplicated
history events.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOME &lt;S&gt; <br>
The default argument for the cd command. This is not set
automatically by the shell in sh, ksh or csh emulation, but
it is typically present in the environment anyway, <br>
and if it becomes set it has its usual special
behaviour.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IFS &lt;S&gt; <br>
Internal field separators (by default space, tab, newline
and NUL), that are used to separate words which result from
command or parameter expansion and words read by the <br>
read builtin. Any characters from the set space, tab and
newline that appear in the IFS are called IFS white space.
One or more IFS white space characters or one non-IFS <br>
white space character together with any adjacent IFS white
space character delimit a field. If an IFS white space
character appears twice consecutively in the IFS, this <br>
character is treated as if it were not an IFS white space
character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the parameter is unset, the
default is used. Note this has a different effect from
setting the parameter to an empty string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KEYBOARD_HACK <br>
This variable defines a character to be removed from the end
of the command line before interpreting it (interactive
shells only). It is intended to fix the problem with <br>
keys placed annoyingly close to return and replaces the
SUNKEYBOARDHACK option which did this for backquotes only.
Should the chosen character be one of singlequote,
dou&acirc; <br>
blequote or backquote, there must also be an odd number of
them on the command line for the last one to be removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For backward compabitility, if
the SUNKEYBOARDHACK option is explicitly set, the value of
KEYBOARD_HACK reverts to backquote. If the option is
explicitly unset, this <br>
variable is set to empty.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KEYTIMEOUT <br>
The time the shell waits, in hundredths of seconds, for
another key to be pressed when reading bound multi-character
sequences.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LANG &lt;S&gt; <br>
This variable determines the locale category for any
category not specifically selected via a variable starting
with &lsquo;LC_&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_ALL &lt;S&gt; <br>
This variable overrides the value of the &lsquo;LANG&rsquo;
variable and the value of any of the other variables
starting with &lsquo;LC_&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_COLLATE &lt;S&gt; <br>
This variable determines the locale category for character
collation information within ranges in glob brackets and for
sorting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_CTYPE &lt;S&gt; <br>
This variable determines the locale category for character
handling functions. If the MULTIBYTE option is in effect
this variable or LANG should contain a value that <br>
reflects the character set in use, even if it is a
single-byte character set, unless only the 7-bit subset
(ASCII) is used. For example, if the character set is <br>
ISO-8859-1, a suitable value might be en_US.iso88591
(certain Linux distributions) or en_US.ISO8859-1
(MacOS).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_MESSAGES &lt;S&gt; <br>
This variable determines the language in which messages
should be written. Note that zsh does not use message
catalogs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_NUMERIC &lt;S&gt; <br>
This variable affects the decimal point character and
thousands separator character for the formatted input/output
functions and string conversion functions. Note that <br>
zsh ignores this setting when parsing floating point
mathematical expressions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_TIME &lt;S&gt; <br>
This variable determines the locale category for date and
time formatting in prompt escape sequences.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LINES &lt;S&gt; <br>
The number of lines for this terminal session. Used for
printing select lists and for the line editor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LISTMAX <br>
In the line editor, the number of matches to list without
asking first. If the value is negative, the list will be
shown if it spans at most as many lines as given by the <br>
absolute value. If set to zero, the shell asks only if the
top of the listing would scroll off the screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LOGCHECK <br>
The interval in seconds between checks for login/logout
activity using the watch parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MAIL If this parameter is set
and mailpath is not set, the shell looks for mail in the
specified file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MAILCHECK <br>
The interval in seconds between checks for new mail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mailpath &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt;
(MAILPATH &lt;S&gt;) <br>
An array (colon-separated list) of filenames to check for
new mail. Each filename can be followed by a &lsquo;?&rsquo;
and a message that will be printed. The message will undergo
<br>
parameter expansion, command substitution and arithmetic
expansion with the variable $_ defined as the name of the
file that has changed. The default message is &lsquo;You
have <br>
new mail&rsquo;. If an element is a directory instead of a
file the shell will recursively check every file in every
subdirectory of the element.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">manpath &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt;
(MANPATH &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt;) <br>
An array (colon-separated list) whose value is not used by
the shell. The manpath array can be useful, however, since
setting it also sets MANPATH, and vice versa.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">match <br>
mbegin <br>
mend Arrays set by the shell when the b globbing flag is
used in pattern matches. See the subsection Globbing flags
in the documentation for Filename Generation in
zshexpn(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MATCH <br>
MBEGIN <br>
MEND Set by the shell when the m globbing flag is used in
pattern matches. See the subsection Globbing flags in the
documentation for Filename Generation in zshexpn(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">module_path &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt;
(MODULE_PATH &lt;S&gt;) <br>
An array (colon-separated list) of directories that zmodload
searches for dynamically loadable modules. This is
initialized to a standard pathname, usually <br>
&lsquo;/usr/local/lib/zsh/$ZSH_VERSION&rsquo;. (The
&lsquo;/usr/local/lib&rsquo; part varies from installation
to installation.) For security reasons, any value set in the
environment when the <br>
shell is started will be ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These parameters only exist if
the installation supports dynamic module loading.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NULLCMD &lt;S&gt; <br>
The command name to assume if a redirection is specified
with no command. Defaults to cat. For sh/ksh behavior,
change this to :. For csh-like behavior, unset this <br>
parameter; the shell will print an error message if null
commands are entered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">path &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt; (PATH
&lt;S&gt;) <br>
An array (colon-separated list) of directories to search for
commands. When this parameter is set, each directory is
scanned and all files found are put in a hash table.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">POSTEDIT &lt;S&gt; <br>
This string is output whenever the line editor exits. It
usually contains termcap strings to reset the terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROMPT &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt; <br>
PROMPT2 &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt; <br>
PROMPT3 &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt; <br>
PROMPT4 &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt; <br>
Same as PS1, PS2, PS3 and PS4, respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">prompt &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt; <br>
Same as PS1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROMPT_EOL_MARK <br>
When the PROMPT_CR and PROMPT_SP options are set, the
PROMPT_EOL_MARK parameter can be used to customize how the
end of partial lines are shown. This parameter undergoes
<br>
prompt expansion, with the PROMPT_PERCENT option set. If not
set, the default behavior is equivalent to the value
&lsquo;%B%S%#%s%b&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PS1 &lt;S&gt; <br>
The primary prompt string, printed before a command is read.
It undergoes a special form of expansion before being
displayed; see EXPANSION OF PROMPT SEQUENCES in zsh&acirc;
<br>
misc(1). The default is &lsquo;%m%# &rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PS2 &lt;S&gt; <br>
The secondary prompt, printed when the shell needs more
information to complete a command. It is expanded in the
same way as PS1. The default is &lsquo;%_&gt; &rsquo;, which
displays <br>
any shell constructs or quotation marks which are currently
being processed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PS3 &lt;S&gt; <br>
Selection prompt used within a select loop. It is expanded
in the same way as PS1. The default is &lsquo;?#
&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PS4 &lt;S&gt; <br>
The execution trace prompt. Default is &lsquo;+%N:%i&gt;
&rsquo;, which displays the name of the current shell
structure and the line number within it. In sh or ksh
emulation, the <br>
default is &lsquo;+ &rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">psvar &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt; (PSVAR
&lt;S&gt;) <br>
An array (colon-separated list) whose first nine values can
be used in PROMPT strings. Setting psvar also sets PSVAR,
and vice versa.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">READNULLCMD &lt;S&gt; <br>
The command name to assume if a single input redirection is
specified with no command. Defaults to more.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REPORTTIME <br>
If nonnegative, commands whose combined user and system
execution times (measured in seconds) are greater than this
value have timing statistics printed for them. Output <br>
is suppressed for commands executed within the line editor,
including completion; commands explicitly marked with the
time keyword still cause the summary to be printed in <br>
this case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REPLY This parameter is reserved
by convention to pass string values between shell scripts
and shell builtins in situations where a function call or
redirection are impossible <br>
or undesirable. The read builtin and the select complex
command may set REPLY, and filename generation both sets and
examines its value when evaluating certain expres&acirc;
<br>
sions. Some modules also employ REPLY for similar
purposes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reply As REPLY, but for array
values rather than strings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RPROMPT &lt;S&gt; <br>
RPS1 &lt;S&gt; <br>
This prompt is displayed on the right-hand side of the
screen when the primary prompt is being displayed on the
left. This does not work if the SINGLE_LINE_ZLE option is
<br>
set. It is expanded in the same way as PS1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RPROMPT2 &lt;S&gt; <br>
RPS2 &lt;S&gt; <br>
This prompt is displayed on the right-hand side of the
screen when the secondary prompt is being displayed on the
left. This does not work if the SINGLE_LINE_ZLE option <br>
is set. It is expanded in the same way as PS2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SAVEHIST <br>
The maximum number of history events to save in the history
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SPROMPT &lt;S&gt; <br>
The prompt used for spelling correction. The sequence
&lsquo;%R&rsquo; expands to the string which presumably
needs spelling correction, and &lsquo;%r&rsquo; expands to
the proposed correction. <br>
All other prompt escapes are also allowed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STTY If this parameter is set in
a command&rsquo;s environment, the shell runs the stty
command with the value of this parameter as arguments in
order to set up the terminal before <br>
executing the command. The modes apply only to the command,
and are reset when it finishes or is suspended. If the
command is suspended and continued later with the fg or <br>
wait builtins it will see the modes specified by STTY, as if
it were not suspended. This (intentionally) does not apply
if the command is continued via &lsquo;kill -CONT&rsquo;.
<br>
STTY is ignored if the command is run in the background, or
if it is in the environment of the shell but not explicitly
assigned to in the input line. This avoids running <br>
stty at every external command by accidentally exporting it.
Also note that STTY should not be used for window size
specifications; these will not be local to the command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TERM &lt;S&gt; <br>
The type of terminal in use. This is used when looking up
termcap sequences. An assignment to TERM causes zsh to
re-initialize the terminal, even if the value does not <br>
change (e.g., &lsquo;TERM=$TERM&rsquo;). It is necessary to
make such an assignment upon any change to the terminal
definition database or terminal type in order for the new
settings <br>
to take effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TERMINFO &lt;S&gt; <br>
A reference to a compiled description of the terminal, used
by the &lsquo;terminfo&rsquo; library when the system has
it; see terminfo(5). If set, this causes the shell to
reini&acirc; <br>
tialise the terminal, making the workaround
&lsquo;TERM=$TERM&rsquo; unnecessary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TIMEFMT <br>
The format of process time reports with the time keyword.
The default is &lsquo;%J %U user %S system %P cpu %*E
total&rsquo;. Recognizes the following escape sequences,
although <br>
not all may be available on all systems, and some that are
available may not be useful:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%% A &lsquo;%&rsquo;. <br>
%U CPU seconds spent in user mode. <br>
%S CPU seconds spent in kernel mode. <br>
%E Elapsed time in seconds. <br>
%P The CPU percentage, computed as (100*%U+%S)/%E. <br>
%W Number of times the process was swapped. <br>
%X The average amount in (shared) text space used in
kilobytes. <br>
%D The average amount in (unshared) data/stack space used in
kilobytes. <br>
%K The total space used (%X+%D) in kilobytes. <br>
%M The maximum memory the process had in use at any time in
megabytes. <br>
%F The number of major page faults (page needed to be
brought from disk). <br>
%R The number of minor page faults. <br>
%I The number of input operations. <br>
%O The number of output operations. <br>
%r The number of socket messages received. <br>
%s The number of socket messages sent. <br>
%k The number of signals received. <br>
%w Number of voluntary context switches (waits). <br>
%c Number of involuntary context switches. <br>
%J The name of this job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A star may be inserted between
the percent sign and flags printing time. This cause the
time to be printed in &lsquo;hh:mm:ss.ttt&rsquo; format
(hours and minutes are only printed if <br>
they are not zero).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TMOUT If this parameter is
nonzero, the shell will receive an ALRM signal if a command
is not entered within the specified number of seconds after
issuing a prompt. If there is <br>
a trap on SIGALRM, it will be executed and a new alarm is
scheduled using the value of the TMOUT parameter after
executing the trap. If no trap is set, and the idle time
<br>
of the terminal is not less than the value of the TMOUT
parameter, zsh terminates. Otherwise a new alarm is
scheduled to TMOUT seconds after the last keypress.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TMPPREFIX <br>
A pathname prefix which the shell will use for all temporary
files. Note that this should include an initial part for the
file name as well as any directory names. The <br>
default is &lsquo;/tmp/zsh&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">watch &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt; (WATCH
&lt;S&gt;) <br>
An array (colon-separated list) of login/logout events to
report. If it contains the single word &lsquo;all&rsquo;,
then all login/logout events are reported. If it contains
the <br>
single word &lsquo;notme&rsquo;, then all events are
reported as with &lsquo;all&rsquo; except $USERNAME. An
entry in this list may consist of a username, an
&lsquo;@&rsquo; followed by a remote hostname, <br>
and a &lsquo;%&rsquo; followed by a line (tty). Any or all
of these components may be present in an entry; if a
login/logout event matches all of them, it is reported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WATCHFMT <br>
The format of login/logout reports if the watch parameter is
set. Default is &lsquo;%n has %a %l from %m&rsquo;.
Recognizes the following escape sequences:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%n The name of the user that
logged in/out.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%a The observed action, i.e.
&quot;logged on&quot; or &quot;logged off&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%l The line (tty) the user is
logged in on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%M The full hostname of the
remote host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%m The hostname up to the first
&lsquo;.&rsquo;. If only the IP address is available or the
utmp field contains the name of an X-windows display, the
whole name is printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: The &lsquo;%m&rsquo; and
&lsquo;%M&rsquo; escapes will work only if there is a host
name field in the utmp on your machine. Otherwise they are
treated as ordinary strings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%S (%s) <br>
Start (stop) standout mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%U (%u) <br>
Start (stop) underline mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%B (%b) <br>
Start (stop) boldface mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%t <br>
%@ The time, in 12-hour, am/pm format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%T The time, in 24-hour
format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%w The date in
&lsquo;day-dd&rsquo; format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%W The date in
&lsquo;mm/dd/yy&rsquo; format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%D The date in
&lsquo;yy-mm-dd&rsquo; format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%(x:true-text:false-text) <br>
Specifies a ternary expression. The character following the
x is arbitrary; the same character is used to separate the
text for the &quot;true&quot; result from that for the <br>
&quot;false&quot; result. Both the separator and the right
parenthesis may be escaped with a backslash. Ternary
expressions may be nested.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The test character x may be any
one of &lsquo;l&rsquo;, &lsquo;n&rsquo;, &lsquo;m&rsquo; or
&lsquo;M&rsquo;, which indicate a &lsquo;true&rsquo; result
if the corresponding escape sequence would return a
non-empty value; or <br>
it may be &lsquo;a&rsquo;, which indicates a
&lsquo;true&rsquo; result if the watched user has logged in,
or &lsquo;false&rsquo; if he has logged out. Other
characters evaluate to neither true nor <br>
false; the entire expression is omitted in this case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the result is
&lsquo;true&rsquo;, then the true-text is formatted
according to the rules above and printed, and the false-text
is skipped. If &lsquo;false&rsquo;, the true-text is <br>
skipped and the false-text is formatted and printed. Either
or both of the branches may be empty, but both separators
must be present in any case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WORDCHARS &lt;S&gt; <br>
A list of non-alphanumeric characters considered part of a
word by the line editor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ZBEEP If set, this gives a
string of characters, which can use all the same codes as
the bindkey command as described in the zsh/zle module entry
in zshmodules(1), that will be <br>
output to the terminal instead of beeping. This may have a
visible instead of an audible effect; for example, the
string &lsquo;\[?5h\[?5l&rsquo; on a vt100 or xterm will
have the <br>
effect of flashing reverse video on and off (if you usually
use reverse video, you should use the string
&lsquo;\[?5l\[?5h&rsquo; instead). This takes precedence
over the NOBEEP <br>
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ZDOTDIR <br>
The directory to search for shell startup files (.zshrc,
etc), if not $HOME.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ZLE_LINE_ABORTED <br>
This parameter is set by the line editor when an error
occurs. It contains the line that was being edited at the
point of the error. &lsquo;print -zr --
$ZLE_LINE_ABORTED&rsquo; can <br>
be used to recover the line. Only the most recent line of
this kind is remembered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ZLE_REMOVE_SUFFIX_CHARS <br>
ZLE_SPACE_SUFFIX_CHARS <br>
These parameters are used by the line editor. In certain
circumstances suffixes (typically space or slash) added by
the completion system will be removed automatically, <br>
either because the next editing command was not an
insertable character, or because the character was marked as
requiring the suffix to be removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These variables can contain the
sets of characters that will cause the suffix to be removed.
If ZLE_REMOVE_SUFFIX_CHARS is set, those characters will
cause the suffix to <br>
be removed; if ZLE_SPACE_SUFFIX_CHARS is set, those
characters will cause the suffix to be removed and replaced
by a space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If ZLE_REMOVE_SUFFIX_CHARS is
not set, the default behaviour is equivalent to:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">ZLE_REMOVE_SUFFIX_CHARS=$&rsquo;
0&amp;|&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If ZLE_REMOVE_SUFFIX_CHARS is
set but is empty, no characters have this behaviour.
ZLE_SPACE_SUFFIX_CHARS takes precedence, so that the
following:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">ZLE_SPACE_SUFFIX_CHARS=$&rsquo;&amp;|&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">causes the characters
&lsquo;&amp;&rsquo; and &lsquo;|&rsquo; to remove the suffix
but to replace it with a space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To illustrate the difference,
suppose that the option AUTO_REMOVE_SLASH is in effect and
the directory DIR has just been completed, with an appended
/, following which the <br>
user types &lsquo;&amp;&rsquo;. The default result is
&lsquo;DIR&amp;&rsquo;. With ZLE_REMOVE_SUFFIX_CHARS set but
without including &lsquo;&amp;&rsquo; the result is
&lsquo;DIR/&amp;&rsquo;. With ZLE_SPACE_SUFFIX_CHARS set to
<br>
include &lsquo;&amp;&rsquo; the result is &lsquo;DIR
&amp;&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that certain completions
may provide their own suffix removal or replacement
behaviour which overrides the values described here. See the
completion system documen&acirc; <br>
tation in zshcompsys(1).</p>
