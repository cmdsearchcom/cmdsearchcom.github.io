make - GNU make utility to maintain groups of programs
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<b>make </b> [ <b>-f</b> <i>makefile</i> ] [ options ] ... [ targets ] ...
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="WARNING"><a class="selflink" href="#WARNING">WARNING</a></h1>
This man page is an extract of the documentation of GNU <i>make</i>. It is
  updated only occasionally, because the GNU project does not use nroff. For
  complete, current documentation, refer to the Info file <b>make.info</b> which
  is made from the Texinfo source file <b>make.texi</b>.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
The purpose of the <i>make</i> utility is to determine automatically which
  pieces of a large program need to be recompiled, and issue the commands to
  recompile them. The manual describes the GNU implementation of <i>make</i>,
  which was written by Richard Stallman and Roland McGrath, and is currently
  maintained by Paul Smith. Our examples show C programs, since they are most
  common, but you can use <i>make</i> with any programming language whose
  compiler can be run with a shell command. In fact, <i>make</i> is not limited
  to programs. You can use it to describe any task where some files must be
  updated automatically from others whenever the others change.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To prepare to use <i>make</i>, you must write a file called the <i>makefile</i>
  that describes the relationships among files in your program, and the states
  the commands for updating each file. In a program, typically the executable
  file is updated from object files, which are in turn made by compiling source
  files.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Once a suitable makefile exists, each time you change some source files, this
  simple shell command:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"><b>make</b></div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
suffices to perform all necessary recompilations. The <i>make</i> program uses
  the makefile data base and the last-modification times of the files to decide
  which of the files need to be updated. For each of those files, it issues the
  commands recorded in the data base.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>make</i> executes commands in the <i>makefile</i> to update one or more
  target <i>names</i>, where <i>name</i> is typically a program. If no <b>-f</b>
  option is present, <i>make</i> will look for the makefiles <i>GNUmakefile</i>,
  <i>makefile</i>, and <i>Makefile</i>, in that order.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Normally you should call your makefile either <i>makefile</i> or
  <i>Makefile</i>. (We recommend <i>Makefile</i> because it appears prominently
  near the beginning of a directory listing, right near other important files
  such as <i>README</i>.) The first name checked, <i>GNUmakefile</i>, is not
  recommended for most makefiles. You should use this name if you have a
  makefile that is specific to GNU <i>make</i>, and will not be understood by
  other versions of <i>make</i>. If <i>makefile</i> is `-', the standard input
  is read.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>make</i> updates a target if it depends on prerequisite files that have been
  modified since the target was last modified, or if the target does not exist.

  <dd class="It-tag">Change to directory <i>dir</i> before reading the makefiles
      or doing anything else. If multiple <b>-C</b> options are specified, each
      is interpreted relative to the previous one: <b>-C </b>/ <b>-C </b>etc is
      equivalent to <b>-C </b>/etc. This is typically used with recursive

      <i>v</i> for more verbose basic debugging, <i>i</i> for showing implicit

      <b>-I</b> flags may come directly after the flag: <b>-I</b><i>dir</i> is

      specified. This also prints the version information given by the <b>-v</b>

  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-t</b>,<b> --touch</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Touch files (mark them up to date without really changing

      When used with the <b>-n</b> flag, this shows you what would happen if you
      were to modify that file. Without <b>-n</b>, it is almost the same as
      running a <i>touch</i> command on the given file before running
      <i>make</i>, except that the modification time is changed only in the

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="EXIT_STATUS"><a class="selflink" href="#EXIT_STATUS">EXIT
  STATUS</a></h1>
GNU <i>make</i> exits with a status of zero if all makefiles were successfully
  parsed and no targets that were built failed. A status of one will be returned
  if the <b>-q</b> flag was used and <i>make</i> determines that a target needs
  to be rebuilt. A status of two will be returned if any errors were
  encountered.
