<p>MRF image format specification(0) MRF image format
specification(0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
MRF - monochrome recursive format (compressed bitmaps)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This program is part of Netpbm(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MRF is a compressed format for
bilevel (1-bit mono) images. It achieves better compression
for some such images than either GIF or PNG. (It&rsquo;s
also very easy to implement (about <br>
the same difficulty as RLE, I&rsquo;d say) and an MRF reader
needs no tables/buffers, which may make it useful for tiny
machines).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In case the above hasn&rsquo;t
made it sufficiently clear, I&rsquo;ll make this next point
explicitly: MRF cannot represent color at all. Nor can it
represent grayscale. It&rsquo;s a specifically <br>
mono format. (If you want to compress a color or grayscale
image, my advice is to use JPEG2000).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">First, here&rsquo;s what goes
where in an MRF file. I&rsquo;ll explain how the compression
works afterward.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Offset Description</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 magic number -
&rsquo;MRF1&rsquo; (in ASCII)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4 width (32-bit, MSB first (i.e.
big-endian))</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">8 height (same)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">12 reserved (single byte, must
be zero)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">13 compressed data</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that there is no
end-of-file marker in the file itself - the compressed data
carries on right up to EOF.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The way the picture is
compressed is essentially very simple, but as they say, the
devil is in the detail. So don&rsquo;t be put off if it
sounds confusing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The image is treated as a number
of 64x64 squares, forming a grid large enough to encompass
it. (If an image is (say) 129x65, it&rsquo;ll be treated in
the same way as a 192x128 one. <br>
On decompression, the extra area which was encoded (the
contents of this area is undefined) should be ignored.) Each
of these squares in turn (in left-to-right, top-to-bottom
<br>
order) is recursively subdivided until the smallest
completely black or white squares are found. Some pseudocode
(eek!) for the recursive subdivision routine should make
things <br>
clearer:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if square size &gt; 1x1 and
square is all one color, output 1 bit <br>
if whole square is black, output a 0 bit and return <br>
if whole square is white, output a 1 bit and return <br>
output a 0 bit <br>
divide the square into four quarters, calling routine for
<br>
each in this order: top-left, top-right, bottom-left,
bottom-right</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(Note that the &rsquo;output a 0
bit&rsquo; stage is not reached for squares of size 1x1,
which is what stops it recursing infinitely. I mention this
as it may not be immediately obvious.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The whole of the compressed data
is made up of the bits output by the above routine. The bits
are packed into bytes MSB first, so for example outputting
the bits 1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0 <br>
would result in a 80h byte being output. Any
&lsquo;unused&rsquo; bits in the last byte output are
undefined; these are effectively after EOF and their value
is unimportant.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If writing that sounds too much
like hard work :-), you could always adapt pbmtomrf and/or
mrftopbm. That&rsquo;s the main reason their source code is
public domain, after all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Above, I said the contents of
any extra area encoded (when a bitmap smaller than the grid
of squares is compressed) is undefined. This is deliberate
so that the MRF compressor <br>
can make these unseen areas anything it wants so as to
maximize compression, rather than simply leaving it blank.
pbmtomrf does a little in this respect but could definitely
be <br>
improved upon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mrftopbm&rsquo;s -1 option
causes it to include the edges, if any, in the output PBM.
This may help when debugging a compressor&rsquo;s edge
optimization.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the &quot;F&quot; in
the name &quot;MRF&quot; comes from &quot;format,&quot;
which is redundant because it is the name of a format. That
sort of makes &quot;MRF format&quot; sound as stupid as
&quot;PIN number,&quot; <br>
but it&rsquo;s not really that bad.</p>
