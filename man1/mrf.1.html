MRF is a compressed format for bilevel (1-bit mono) images. It achieves better
  compression for some such images than either GIF or PNG. (It's also very easy
  to implement (about the same difficulty as RLE, I'd say) and an MRF reader
  needs no tables/buffers, which may make it useful for tiny machines).
<div class="Pp"></div>
In case the above hasn't made it sufficiently clear, I'll make this next point
  explicitly: <i>MRF cannot represent color at all.</i> Nor can it represent
  grayscale. It's a specifically mono format. (If you want to compress a color
  or grayscale image, my advice is to use JPEG2000).
<div class="Pp"></div>
First, here's what goes where in an MRF file. I'll explain how the compression
  works afterward.

<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that there is no end-of-file marker in the file itself - the compressed
  data carries on right up to EOF.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The way the picture is compressed is essentially very simple, but as they say,
  the devil is in the detail. So don't be put off if it sounds confusing.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The image is treated as a number of 64x64 squares, forming a grid large enough
  to encompass it. (If an image is (say) 129x65, it'll be treated in the same
  way as a 192x128 one. On decompression, the extra area which was encoded (the
  contents of this area is undefined) should be ignored.) Each of these squares
  in turn (in left-to-right, top-to-bottom order) is recursively subdivided
  until the smallest completely black or white squares are found. Some
  pseudocode (eek!) for the recursive subdivision routine should make things
  clearer:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
    if square size &gt; 1x1 and square is all one color, output 1 bit
    if whole square is black, output a 0 bit and return
    if whole square is white, output a 1 bit and return
    output a 0 bit
    divide the square into four quarters, calling routine for
    each in this order: top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
(Note that the 'output a 0 bit' stage is not reached for squares of size 1x1,
  which is what stops it recursing infinitely. I mention this as it may not be
  immediately obvious.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
The whole of the compressed data is made up of the bits output by the above
  routine. The bits are packed into bytes MSB first, so for example outputting
  the bits 1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0 would result in a 80h byte being output. Any `unused'
  bits in the last byte output are undefined; these are effectively after EOF
  and their value is unimportant.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If writing that sounds too much like hard work :-), you could always adapt
  <b>pbmtomrf</b> and/or <b>mrftopbm</b>. That's the main reason their source
  code is public domain, after all.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Above, I said the contents of any extra area encoded (when a bitmap smaller than
  the grid of squares is compressed) is undefined. This is deliberate so that
  the MRF compressor can make these unseen areas anything it wants so as to
  maximize compression, rather than simply leaving it blank. <b>pbmtomrf</b>
  does a little in this respect but could definitely be improved upon.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>mrftopbm</b>'s <b>-1</b> option causes it to include the edges, if any, in
  the output PBM. This may help when debugging a compressor's edge optimization.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that the &quot;F&quot; in the name &quot;MRF&quot; comes from
  &quot;format,&quot; which is redundant because it is the name of a format.
  That sort of makes &quot;MRF format&quot; sound as stupid as &quot;PIN
  number,&quot; but it's not really that bad.
