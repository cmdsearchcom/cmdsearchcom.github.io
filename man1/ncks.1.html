<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
ncks combines every feature we could think of, except the
kitchen sink, into one versatile utility to manipulate
netCDF files. ncks extracts a subset of the data from
input-file <br>
and either prints it as ASCII text to stdout, or writes (or
pastes) it to output-file, or both.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ncks will print netCDF data in
ASCII format to stdout, like ncdump, but with these
differences: ncks prints data in a tabular format intended
to be easy to search for the data <br>
you want, one datum per screen line, with all dimension
subscripts and coordinate values (if any) preceding the
datum. Option -s allows the user the format the data using
C- <br>
style format strings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options -a, -F, -H, -M, -m, -Q,
-q, -s, -u, and -V control the formatted appearance of the
data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ncks will extract (and
optionally create a new netCDF file comprised of) only
selected variable from the input file, like ncextr but with
these differences: Only variables and <br>
coordinates may be specifically included or excluded---all
global attributes and any attribute associated with an
extracted variable will be copied to the screen and/or
output <br>
netCDF file. Options -c, -C, -v, and -x control which
variables are extracted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ncks will extract hyperslabs
from the specified variables. In fact ncks implements the
nccut specification exactly. Option -d controls the
hyperslab specification.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Input dimensions that are not
associated with any output variable will not appear in the
output netCDF. This feature removes superfluous dimensions
from a netCDF file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ncks will append variables and
attributes from the input-file to output-file if output-file
is a pre-existing netCDF file whose relevant dimensions
conform to dimension sizes of <br>
input-file. The append features of ncks are intended to
provide a rudimentary means of adding data from one netCDF
file to another, conforming, netCDF file. When naming
con&acirc; <br>
flicts exists between the two files, data in output-file is
usually overwritten by the corresponding data from
input-file. Thus it is recommended that the user backup
output- <br>
file in case valuable data is accidentally overwritten.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If output-file exists, the user
will be queried whether to overwrite, append, or exit the
ncks call completely. Choosing overwrite destroys the
existing output-file and create <br>
an entirely new one from the output of the ncks call. Append
has differing effects depending on the uniqueness of the
variables and attributes output by ncks: If a variable or
<br>
attribute extracted from input-file does not have a name
conflict with the members of output-file then it will be
added to output-file without overwriting any of the existing
<br>
contents of output-file. In this case the relevant
dimensions must agree (conform) between the two files; new
dimensions are created in output-file as required. When a
name <br>
conflict occurs, a global attribute from input-file will
overwrite the corresponding global attribute from
output-file. If the name conflict occurs for a non-record
variable, <br>
then the dimensions and type of the variable (and of its
coordinate dimensions, if any) must agree (conform) in both
files. Then the variable values (and any coordinate
dimen&acirc; <br>
sion values) from input-file will overwrite the
corresponding variable values (and coordinate dimension
values, if any) in output-file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since there can only be one
record dimension in a file, the record dimension must have
the same name (but not necessarily the same size) in both
files if a record dimension vari&acirc; <br>
able is to be appended. If the record dimensions are of
differing sizes, the record dimension of output-file will
become the greater of the two record dimension sizes, the
<br>
record variable from input-file will overwrite any
counterpart in output-file and fill values will be written
to any gaps left in the rest of the record variables (I
think). In <br>
all cases variable attributes in output-file are superseded
by attributes of the same name from input-file, and left
alone if there is no name conflict.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some users may wish to avoid
interactive ncks queries about whether to overwrite existing
data. For example, batch scripts will fail if ncks does not
receive responses to its <br>
queries. Options -O and -A are available to force
overwriting existing files and variables, respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options specific to ncks</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following list provides a
short summary of the features unique to ncks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a Do not alphabetize extracted
fields. By default, the specified output variables are
extracted, printed, and written to disk in alphabetical
order. This tends to make <br>
long output lists easier to search for particular variables.
Specifying -a results in the variables being extracted,
printed, and written to disk in the order in which <br>
they were saved in the input file. Thus -a retains the
original ordering of the variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d dim,[ min][,[ max]][,[
stride]] Add stride argument to hyperslabber.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H Print data to screen. The
default behavior is to print data to screen if no netCDF
output file is specified. Use -H to print data to screen if
a netCDF output is speci&acirc; <br>
fied (the same behavior applies to -m ). Unless otherwise
specified (with -s), each element of the data hyperslab is
printed on a separate line containing the names, <br>
indices, and, values, if any, of all of the variables
dimensions. The dimension and variable indices refer to the
location of the corresponding data element with respect <br>
to the variable as stored on disk (i.e., not the hyperslab).
<br>
% ncks -H -C -v three_dmn_var in.nc <br>
lat[0]=-90 lev[0]=100 lon[0]=0 three_dmn_var[0]=0 <br>
lat[0]=-90 lev[0]=100 lon[1]=90 three_dmn_var[1]=1 <br>
lat[0]=-90 lev[0]=100 lon[2]=180 three_dmn_var[2]=2 <br>
... <br>
lat[1]=90 lev[2]=1000 lon[1]=90 three_dmn_var[21]=21 <br>
lat[1]=90 lev[2]=1000 lon[2]=180 three_dmn_var[22]=22 <br>
lat[1]=90 lev[2]=1000 lon[3]=270 three_dmn_var[23]=23 <br>
Printing the same variable with the -F option shows the same
variable indexed with Fortran conventions <br>
% ncks -F -H -C -v three_dmn_var in.nc <br>
lon(1)=0 lev(1)=100 lat(1)=-90 three_dmn_var(1)=0 <br>
lon(2)=90 lev(1)=100 lat(1)=-90 three_dmn_var(2)=1 <br>
lon(3)=180 lev(1)=100 lat(1)=-90 three_dmn_var(3)=2 <br>
... <br>
Printing a hyperslab does not affect the variable or
dimension indices since these indices are relative to the
full variable (as stored in the input file), and the input
file has <br>
not changed. However, if the hyperslab is saved to an output
file and those values are printed, the indices will change:
<br>
% ncks -H -d lat,90.0 -d lev,1000.0 -v three_dmn_var in.nc
out.nc <br>
lat[1]=90 lev[2]=1000 lon[0]=0 three_dmn_var[20]=20 <br>
lat[1]=90 lev[2]=1000 lon[1]=90 three_dmn_var[21]=21 <br>
lat[1]=90 lev[2]=1000 lon[2]=180 three_dmn_var[22]=22 <br>
lat[1]=90 lev[2]=1000 lon[3]=270 three_dmn_var[23]=23 <br>
% ncks -H out.nc <br>
lat[0]=90 lev[0]=1000 lon[0]=0 three_dmn_var[0]=20 <br>
lat[0]=90 lev[0]=1000 lon[1]=90 three_dmn_var[1]=21 <br>
lat[0]=90 lev[0]=1000 lon[2]=180 three_dmn_var[2]=22 <br>
lat[0]=90 lev[0]=1000 lon[3]=270 three_dmn_var[3]=23</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M Print to screen the global
metadata describing the file. This includes file summary
information and global attributes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m Print variable metadata to
screen (similar to ncdump -h). This displays all metadata
pertaining to each variable, one variable at a time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Q Toggle printing of dimension
indices and coordinate values when printing arrays. The name
of each variable will appear flush left in the output. This
is useful when try&acirc; <br>
ing to locate specific variables when displaying many
variables with different dimensions. The mnemonic for this
option is &quot;quiet&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s format String format for text
output. Accepts C language escape sequences and printf()
formats.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u Accompany the printing of a
variable&rsquo;s values with its units attribute, if it
exists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
View all data in netCDF in.nc, printed with Fortran indexing
conventions: <br>
ncks -H -F in.nc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Copy the netCDF file in.nc to
file out.nc. <br>
ncks -O in.nc out.nc <br>
Now the file out.nc contains all the data from in.nc. There
are, however, two differences between in.nc and out.nc.
First, the history global attribute will contain the command
<br>
used to create out.nc. Second, the variables in out.nc will
be defined in alphabetical order. Of course the internal
storage of variable in a netCDF file should be transparent
<br>
to the user, but there are cases when alphabetizing a file
is useful (see description of -a switch).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Print variable three_dmn_var
from file in.nc with default notations. Next print
three_dmn_var as an un-annotated text column. Then print
three_dmn_var signed with very high <br>
precision. Finally, print three_dmn_var as a comma-separated
list. <br>
% ncks -H -C -v three_dmn_var in.nc <br>
lat[0]=-90 lev[0]=100 lon[0]=0 three_dmn_var[0]=0 <br>
lat[0]=-90 lev[0]=100 lon[1]=90 three_dmn_var[1]=1 <br>
... <br>
lat[1]=90 lev[2]=1000 lon[3]=270 three_dmn_var[23]=23 <br>
% ncks -s &quot;%f0 -H -C -v three_dmn_var in.nc <br>
0.000000 <br>
1.000000 <br>
... <br>
23.000000 <br>
% ncks -s &quot;%+16.10f0 -H -C -v three_dmn_var in.nc <br>
+0.0000000000 <br>
+1.0000000000 <br>
... <br>
+23.0000000000 <br>
% ncks -s &quot;%f, &quot; -H -C -v three_dmn_var in.nc <br>
0.000000, 1.000000, ... , 23.000000, <br>
The second and third options are useful when pasting data
into text files like reports or papers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One dimensional arrays of
characters stored as netCDF variables are automatically
printed as strings, whether or not they are NUL-terminated,
e.g., <br>
ncks -v fl_nm in.nc <br>
The %c formatting code is useful for printing
multidimensional arrays of characters representing fixed
length strings <br>
ncks -H -s &quot;%c&quot; -v fl_nm_arr in.nc <br>
Using the %s format code on strings which are not
NUL-terminated (and thus not technically strings) is likely
to result in a core dump.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Create netCDF out.nc containing
all variables, and any associated coordinates, except
variable time, from netCDF in.nc: <br>
ncks -x -v time in.nc out.nc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Extract variables time and
pressure from netCDF in.nc. If out.nc does not exist it will
be created. Otherwise the you will be prompted whether to
append to or to overwrite <br>
out.nc: <br>
ncks -v time,pressure in.nc out.nc <br>
ncks -C -v time,pressure in.nc out.nc <br>
The first version of the command creates an out.nc which
contains time, pressure, and any coordinate variables
associated with pressure. The out.nc from the second version
is <br>
guaranteed to contain only two variables time and
pressure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Create netCDF out.nc containing
all variables from file in.nc. Restrict the dimensions of
these variables to a hyperslab. Print (with -H) the
hyperslabs to the screen for good <br>
measure. The specified hyperslab is: the sixth value in
dimension time; the half-open range lat &lt;= 0.0 in
coordinate lat; the half-open range lon &gt;= 330.0 in
coordinate lon; the <br>
closed interval 0.3 &lt;= band &lt;= 0.5 in coordinate band;
and cross-section closest to 1000.0 in coordinate lev. Note
that limits applied to coordinate values are specified with
a <br>
decimal point, and limits applied to dimension indices do
not have a decimal point. <br>
ncks -H -d time,5 -d lat,,0. -d lon,330., -d band,.3,.5 -d
lev,1000. in.nc out.nc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Assume the domain of the
monotonically increasing longitude coordinate lon is 0 &lt;
lon &lt; 360. Here, lon is an example of a wrapped
coordinate. ncks will extract a hyperslab <br>
which crosses the Greenwich meridian simply by specifying
the westernmost longitude as min and the easternmost
longitude as max, as follows: <br>
ncks -d lon,260.,45. in.nc out.nc</p>
