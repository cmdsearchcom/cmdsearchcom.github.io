<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
git-pbuilder - Wrapper around cowbuilder/qemubuilder for gbp
buildpackage</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
DIST=distribution ARCH=architecture
[BUILDER=(pbuilder|qemubuilder)] git-pbuilder
debbuild-options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIST=distribution
ARCH=architecture [BUILDER=(pbuilder|qemubuilder)]

cowbuilder-options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
git-pbuilder is a wrapper around pdebuild intended for use
by gbp buildpackage. It configures pdebuild to use
cowbuilder by default, passes appropriate options to
debbuild, and <br>
sets the base path for cowbuilder based on the environment
variable DIST and, if set, the environment variable ARCH.
qemubuilder can be selected instead by setting the <br>
environment variable BUILDER to &quot;qemubuilder&quot;, and
pbuilder can be selected by setting BUILDER to
&quot;pbuilder&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, git-pbuilder assumes
the target distribution is &quot;sid&quot;, the same
architecture as the cowbuilder default, and uses
/var/cache/pbuilder/base-sid.cow if it exists. If it <br>
doesn&rsquo;t, /var/cache/pbuilder/base.cow is tried. If
DIST is set, its value is the target distribution and
/var/cache/pbuilder/base-dist.cow is used instead. If DIST
is &quot;etch&quot; or <br>
&quot;ebo&quot;, --debian-etch-workaround is also passed to
cowbuilder. If ARCH is set, its value is the target
architecture and /var/cache/pbuilder/base-dist-arch.cow is
used, with dist <br>
being set to &quot;sid&quot; if DIST was not set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If qemubuilder is used as the
builder, no base directory is used. Instead, qemubuilder is
invoked with the --config option pointing to the file <br>
/var/cache/pbuilder/qemubuilder-arch-dist.conf</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If pbuilder is used as the
builder, git-pbuilder instead looks for
/var/cache/pbuilder/base-sid.tgz by default and
/var/cache/pbuilder/base.tgz if it doesn&rsquo;t exist. If
DIST or <br>
ARCH are set, they are used to form the expected name of the
tgz file in the same way as they&rsquo;re used to form the
expected base directory for cowbuilder. Similar to
cowbuilder, <br>
--debian-etch-workaround is passed to pbuilder if from the
DIST setting it looks like the target distribution is
etch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If git-pbuilder is invoked via a
name that starts with &quot;git-*-&quot;, the part between
the hyphens is taken to be the default name of the builder
to use. However, &quot;pbuilder&quot; is <br>
mapped to cowbuilder for backward compatibility; if you want
to use pbuilder, you have to explicitly set BUILDER. The
part after the last hyphen is taken to be the default <br>
distribution (if it contains no additional hyphen) or the
default distribution followed by the default architecture
(if it contains a hyphen). One can therefore create symlinks
<br>
like &quot;git-pbuilder-squeeze&quot; pointing to
git-pbuilder and use that name when wanting to use a
distribution of &quot;squeeze&quot;, or
&quot;git-qemubuilder-sid-armel&quot; to use qemubuilder to
build <br>
for the &quot;armel&quot; architecture and the
&quot;sid&quot; distribution. Explicit settings of BUILDER,
DIST, or ARCH always override any guesses from the command
name. (But note that gbp <br>
buildpackage does not pass on environment variables when run
with --git-pbuilder; see below.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any arguments are passed as-is
to dpkg-buildpackage via the --debbuildopts option to
pdebuild. To pass arguments to the builder instead, put them
in the environment variable <br>
GIT_PBUILDER_OPTIONS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To disable all attempts to
discover the base path, tarball, or configuration file and
set up the pbuilder options and instead rely on the settings
in .pbuilderrc, set <br>
GIT_PBUILDER_AUTOCONF to &quot;no&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normally, one does not run this
script directly. Instead, it&rsquo;s used as the builder
script for gbp buildpackage via the --git-pbuilder
command-line option. When run this way, <br>
you should use the --git-dist, --git-arch,
--git-qemubuilder, --git-pbuilder-autoconf, and
--git-pbuilder-options flags instead of setting the DIST,
ARCH, BUILDER, <br>
GIT_PBUILDER_AUTOCONF, and GIT_PBUILDER_OPTIONS environment
variables. See gbp-buildpackage(1) for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alternately, git-pbuilder may be
called with an argument of &quot;update&quot;,
&quot;create&quot;, or &quot;login&quot;. In this case, it
calls cowbuilder (or the configured builder as described
above) <br>
using sudo and passes the corresponding command to the
builder, using the same logic as above to determine the base
directory and distribution. If the distribution (set in
DIST) <br>
ends in &quot;-backports&quot;, one of the following will be
added as an --othermirror parameter to the builder:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">deb http://ftp.debian.org/debian
$DIST main <br>
deb http://backports.debian.org/debian-backports $DIST
main</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first will be used for most
distributions, and the second for
&quot;squeeze-backports&quot;. If the distribution ends in
&quot;-lts&quot;, the following will be added as an
--othermirror <br>
parameter to the builder:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">deb http://ftp.debian.org/debian
$DIST main</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">to support building for Long
Term Support releases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any additional arguments to
git-pbuilder are passed along to the builder. Due to how
sudo works, invoking the builder with an action will not
read the user&rsquo;s .pbuilderrc by <br>
default, so in this case git-pbuilder will add an explicit
--configfile option pointing to the user&rsquo;s .pbuilderrc
if it exists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you use git-pbuilder with one
of these arguments, you must have the &quot;sudo&quot;
package installed, and you must configure sudo to let the
current user run the appropriate builder <br>
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
ARCH <br>
Sets the target architecture. For a cowbuilder builder, this
sets both the base path and is passed as the --architecture
option. With qemubuilder, this controls the path to <br>
the configuration file. With pbuilder, this sets the tgz
path and is passed as --architecture.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUILDER <br>
Sets the builder to use. The only supported settings are
&quot;cowbuilder&quot; (the default),
&quot;qemubuilder&quot;, and &quot;pbuilder&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COWBUILDER_BASE <br>
Set this environment variable to change the default location
for the cowbuilder base directories
(/var/cache/pbuilder).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIST <br>
Sets the target distribution. This is used primarily to
determine the base path for cowbuilder or pbuilder or the
configuration file path for qemubuilder, but it&rsquo;s also
used <br>
to determine whether to pass --debian-etch-workaround to
cowbuilder or pbuilder.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GIT_PBUILDER_AUTOCONF <br>
If set to &quot;no&quot;, disable the logic that constructs
the base path, tarball, or configuration file and all other
logic to determine the options to pass to the builder.
Instead, <br>
just run the configured builder and assume its configuration
is handled elsewhere (such as in .pbuilderrc). This also
suppresses setting --buildresult, so the user will need <br>
to ensure that the configuration still puts packages where
gbp buildpackage expects them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GIT_PBUILDER_OPTIONS <br>
Add additional options for the builder. These options are
passed as-is to cowbuilder, qemubuilder, or pbuilder via
pdebuild. The contents of this variable will undergo <br>
shell expansion, so any arguments containing shell
metacharacters or whitespace need to be quoted in the value
of the environment variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GIT_PBUILDER_OUTPUT_DIR <br>
Where to put the result of the build. The default is
&quot;..&quot; (the parent directory). This setting is
ignored if GIT_PBUILDER_AUTOCONF is set to
&quot;no&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GIT_PBUILDER_PDEBUILDOPTIONS
<br>
Add additional options for pdebuild itself (such as
--use-pdebuild-internal). The contents of this variable will
undergo shell expansion, so any arguments containing shell
<br>
metacharacters or whitespace need to be quoted in the value
of the environment variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PBUILDER_BASE <br>
Set this environment variable to change the default location
for the pbuilder tgz files (/var/cache/pbuilder) when
BUILDER is set to &quot;pbuilder&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/var/cache/pbuilder/base-sid.cow <br>
/var/cache/pbuilder/base.cow <br>
The default &quot;cowbuilder --basepath&quot; directories,
searched for in that order, if neither DIST nor ARCH is
set.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">/var/cache/pbuilder/base-sid-$ARCH.cow
<br>
The &quot;cowbuilder --basepath&quot; directory used if ARCH
is set and DIST is not set.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">/var/cache/pbuilder/base-$DIST.cow
<br>
The &quot;cowbuilder --basepath&quot; directory used if DIST
is set and ARCH is not.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">/var/cache/pbuilder/base-$DIST-$ARCH.cow
<br>
The &quot;cowbuilder --basepath&quot; directory used if DIST
and ARCH are both set.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">/var/cache/pbuilder/base-sid.tgz
<br>
/var/cache/pbuilder/base.tgz <br>
/var/cache/pbuilder/base-sid-$ARCH.tgz <br>
/var/cache/pbuilder/base-$DIST.tgz <br>
/var/cache/pbuilder/base-$DIST-$ARCH.tgz <br>
Similar to the above, the &quot;pbuilder --basetgz&quot;
path used for various settings of DIST and ARCH if BUILDER
is set to &quot;pbuilder&quot;.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">/var/cache/pbuilder/qemubuilder-$ARCH-$DIST.conf
<br>
The &quot;qemubuilder --config&quot; file used. $ARCH
defaults to &quot;armel&quot; and $DIST defaults to
&quot;sid&quot; if not set.</p>
