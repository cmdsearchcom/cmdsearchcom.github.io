<p>BASH_BUILTINS(1) General Commands Manual
BASH_BUILTINS(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
bash, :, ., [, alias, bg, bind, break, builtin, caller, cd,
command, compgen, complete, compopt, continue, declare,
dirs, disown, echo, enable, eval, exec, exit, export, false,
<br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BASH BUILTIN COMMANDS <br>
Unless otherwise noted, each builtin command documented in
this section as accepting options preceded by - accepts --
to signify the end of the options. The :, true, false, and
<br>
test builtins do not accept options and do not treat --
specially. The exit, logout, break, continue, let, and shift
builtins accept and process arguments beginning with -
with&acirc; <br>
out requiring --. Other builtins that accept arguments but
are not specified as accepting options interpret arguments
beginning with - as invalid options and require -- to
pre&acirc; <br>
vent this interpretation. <br>
: [arguments] <br>
No effect; the command does nothing beyond expanding
arguments and performing any specified redirections. A zero
exit code is returned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">. filename [arguments] <br>
source filename [arguments] <br>
Read and execute commands from filename in the current shell
environment and return the exit status of the last command
executed from filename. If filename does not con&acirc; <br>
tain a slash, filenames in PATH are used to find the
directory containing filename. The file searched for in PATH
need not be executable. When bash is not in posix mode, <br>
the current directory is searched if no file is found in
PATH. If the sourcepath option to the shopt builtin command
is turned off, the PATH is not searched. If any <br>
arguments are supplied, they become the positional
parameters when filename is executed. Otherwise the
positional parameters are unchanged. The return status is
the sta&acirc; <br>
tus of the last command exited within the script (0 if no
commands are executed), and false if filename is not found
or cannot be read.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">alias [-p] [name[=value] ...]
<br>
Alias with no arguments or with the -p option prints the
list of aliases in the form alias name=value on standard
output. When arguments are supplied, an alias is defined
<br>
for each name whose value is given. A trailing space in
value causes the next word to be checked for alias
substitution when the alias is expanded. For each name in
the <br>
argument list for which no value is supplied, the name and
value of the alias is printed. Alias returns true unless a
name is given for which no alias has been defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bg [jobspec ...] <br>
Resume each suspended job jobspec in the background, as if
it had been started with &amp;. If jobspec is not present,
the shell&rsquo;s notion of the current job is used. bg
job&acirc; <br>
spec returns 0 unless run when job control is disabled or,
when run with job control enabled, any specified jobspec was
not found or was started without job control.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bind [-m keymap] [-lpsvPSVX]
<br>
bind [-m keymap] [-q function] [-u function] [-r keyseq]
<br>
bind [-m keymap] -f filename <br>
bind [-m keymap] -x keyseq:shell-command <br>
bind [-m keymap] keyseq:function-name <br>
bind readline-command <br>
Display current readline key and function bindings, bind a
key sequence to a readline function or macro, or set a
readline variable. Each non-option argument is a command
<br>
as it would appear in .inputrc, but each binding or command
must be passed as a separate argument; e.g.,
&rsquo;&quot;read-init-file&rsquo;. Options, if supplied,
have the <br>
following meanings: <br>
-m keymap <br>
Use keymap as the keymap to be affected by the subsequent
bindings. Acceptable keymap names are emacs, emacs-standard,
emacs-meta, emacs-ctlx, vi, vi-move, vi-com&acirc; <br>
mand, and vi-insert. vi is equivalent to vi-command; emacs
is equivalent to emacs-standard. <br>
-l List the names of all readline functions. <br>
-p Display readline function names and bindings in such a
way that they can be re-read. <br>
-P List current readline function names and bindings. <br>
-s Display readline key sequences bound to macros and the
strings they output in such a way that they can be re-read.
<br>
-S Display readline key sequences bound to macros and the
strings they output. <br>
-v Display readline variable names and values in such a way
that they can be re-read. <br>
-V List current readline variable names and values. <br>
-f filename <br>
Read key bindings from filename. <br>
-q function <br>
Query about which keys invoke the named function. <br>
-u function <br>
Unbind all keys bound to the named function. <br>
-r keyseq <br>
Remove any current binding for keyseq. <br>
-x keyseq:shell-command <br>
Cause shell-command to be executed whenever keyseq is
entered. When shell-command is executed, the shell sets the
READLINE_LINE variable to the contents of the <br>
readline line buffer and the READLINE_POINT variable to the
current location of the insertion point. If the executed
command changes the value of READLINE_LINE or <br>
READLINE_POINT, those new values will be reflected in the
editing state. <br>
-X List all key sequences bound to shell commands and the
associated commands in a format that can be reused as
input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The return value is 0 unless an
unrecognized option is given or an error occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">break [n] <br>
Exit from within a for, while, until, or select loop. If n
is specified, break n levels. n must be &acirc;&yen; 1. If n
is greater than the number of enclosing loops, all
enclos&acirc; <br>
ing loops are exited. The return value is 0 unless n is not
greater than or equal to 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">builtin shell-builtin
[arguments] <br>
Execute the specified shell builtin, passing it arguments,
and return its exit status. This is useful when defining a
function whose name is the same as a shell builtin, <br>
retaining the functionality of the builtin within the
function. The cd builtin is commonly redefined this way. The
return status is false if shell-builtin is not a shell <br>
builtin command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">caller [expr] <br>
Returns the context of any active subroutine call (a shell
function or a script executed with the . or source
builtins). Without expr, caller displays the line number and
<br>
source filename of the current subroutine call. If a
non-negative integer is supplied as expr, caller displays
the line number, subroutine name, and source file
corre&acirc; <br>
sponding to that position in the current execution call
stack. This extra information may be used, for example, to
print a stack trace. The current frame is frame 0. <br>
The return value is 0 unless the shell is not executing a
subroutine call or expr does not correspond to a valid
position in the call stack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cd [-L|[-P [-e]] [-@]] [dir]
<br>
Change the current directory to dir. if dir is not supplied,
the value of the HOME shell variable is the default. Any
additional arguments following dir are ignored. <br>
The variable CDPATH defines the search path for the
directory containing dir: each directory name in CDPATH is
searched for dir. Alternative directory names in CDPATH are
<br>
separated by a colon (:). A null directory name in CDPATH is
the same as the current directory, i.e.,
&lsquo;&lsquo;.&rsquo;&rsquo;. If dir begins with a slash
(/), then CDPATH is not used. The <br>
-P option causes cd to use the physical directory structure
by resolving symbolic links while traversing dir and before
processing instances of .. in dir (see also the -P <br>
option to the set builtin command); the -L option forces
symbolic links to be followed by resolving the link after
processing instances of .. in dir. If .. appears in <br>
dir, it is processed by removing the immediately previous
pathname component from dir, back to a slash or the
beginning of dir. If the -e option is supplied with -P, and
<br>
the current working directory cannot be successfully
determined after a successful directory change, cd will
return an unsuccessful status. On systems that support it,
<br>
the -@ option presents the extended attributes associated
with a file as a directory. An argument of - is converted to
$OLDPWD before the directory change is attempted. <br>
If a non-empty directory name from CDPATH is used, or if -
is the first argument, and the directory change is
successful, the absolute pathname of the new working
direc&acirc; <br>
tory is written to the standard output. The return value is
true if the directory was successfully changed; false
otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">command [-pVv] command [arg ...]
<br>
Run command with args suppressing the normal shell function
lookup. Only builtin commands or commands found in the PATH
are executed. If the -p option is given, the <br>
search for command is performed using a default value for
PATH that is guaranteed to find all of the standard
utilities. If either the -V or -v option is supplied, a <br>
description of command is printed. The -v option causes a
single word indicating the command or filename used to
invoke command to be displayed; the -V option produces a
<br>
more verbose description. If the -V or -v option is
supplied, the exit status is 0 if command was found, and 1
if not. If neither option is supplied and an error <br>
occurred or command cannot be found, the exit status is 127.
Otherwise, the exit status of the command builtin is the
exit status of command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">compgen [option] [word] <br>
Generate possible completion matches for word according to
the options, which may be any option accepted by the
complete builtin with the exception of -p and -r, and write
<br>
the matches to the standard output. When using the -F or -C
options, the various shell variables set by the programmable
completion facilities, while available, will not <br>
have useful values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The matches will be generated in
the same way as if the programmable completion code had
generated them directly from a completion specification with
the same flags. If <br>
word is specified, only those completions matching word will
be displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The return value is true unless
an invalid option is supplied, or no matches were
generated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">complete [-abcdefgjksuv] [-o
comp-option] [-DE] [-A action] [-G globpat] [-W wordlist]
[-F function] [-C command] <br>
[-X filterpat] [-P prefix] [-S suffix] name [name ...] <br>
complete -pr [-DE] [name ...] <br>
Specify how arguments to each name should be completed. If
the -p option is supplied, or if no options are supplied,
existing completion specifications are printed in a <br>
way that allows them to be reused as input. The -r option
removes a completion specification for each name, or, if no
names are supplied, all completion specifications. <br>
The -D option indicates that the remaining options and
actions should apply to the
&lsquo;&lsquo;default&rsquo;&rsquo; command completion; that
is, completion attempted on a command for which no <br>
completion has previously been defined. The -E option
indicates that the remaining options and actions should
apply to &lsquo;&lsquo;empty&rsquo;&rsquo; command
completion; that is, completion <br>
attempted on a blank line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The process of applying these
completion specifications when word completion is attempted
is described above under Programmable Completion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other options, if specified,
have the following meanings. The arguments to the -G, -W,
and -X options (and, if necessary, the -P and -S options)
should be quoted to pro&acirc; <br>
tect them from expansion before the complete builtin is
invoked. <br>
-o comp-option <br>
The comp-option controls several aspects of the
compspec&rsquo;s behavior beyond the simple generation of
completions. comp-option may be one of: <br>
bashdefault <br>
Perform the rest of the default bash completions if the
compspec generates no matches. <br>
default Use readline&rsquo;s default filename completion if
the compspec generates no matches. <br>
dirnames <br>
Perform directory name completion if the compspec generates
no matches. <br>
filenames <br>
Tell readline that the compspec generates filenames, so it
can perform any filename-specific processing (like adding a
slash to directory names, quoting <br>
special characters, or suppressing trailing spaces).
Intended to be used with shell functions. <br>
noquote Tell readline not to quote the completed words if
they are filenames (quoting filenames is the default). <br>
nospace Tell readline not to append a space (the default) to
words completed at the end of the line. <br>
plusdirs <br>
After any matches defined by the compspec are generated,
directory name completion is attempted and any matches are
added to the results of the other <br>
actions. <br>
-A action <br>
The action may be one of the following to generate a list of
possible completions: <br>
alias Alias names. May also be specified as -a. <br>
arrayvar <br>
Array variable names. <br>
binding Readline key binding names. <br>
builtin Names of shell builtin commands. May also be
specified as -b. <br>
command Command names. May also be specified as -c. <br>
directory <br>
Directory names. May also be specified as -d. <br>
disabled <br>
Names of disabled shell builtins. <br>
enabled Names of enabled shell builtins. <br>
export Names of exported shell variables. May also be
specified as -e. <br>
file File names. May also be specified as -f. <br>
function <br>
Names of shell functions. <br>
group Group names. May also be specified as -g. <br>
helptopic <br>
Help topics as accepted by the help builtin. <br>
hostname <br>
Hostnames, as taken from the file specified by the HOSTFILE
shell variable. <br>
job Job names, if job control is active. May also be
specified as -j. <br>
keyword Shell reserved words. May also be specified as -k.
<br>
running Names of running jobs, if job control is active.
<br>
service Service names. May also be specified as -s. <br>
setopt Valid arguments for the -o option to the set builtin.
<br>
shopt Shell option names as accepted by the shopt builtin.
<br>
signal Signal names. <br>
stopped Names of stopped jobs, if job control is active.
<br>
user User names. May also be specified as -u. <br>
variable <br>
Names of all shell variables. May also be specified as -v.
<br>
-C command <br>
command is executed in a subshell environment, and its
output is used as the possible completions. <br>
-F function <br>
The shell function function is executed in the current shell
environment. When the function is executed, the first
argument ($1) is the name of the command whose <br>
arguments are being completed, the second argument ($2) is
the word being completed, and the third argument ($3) is the
word preceding the word being completed on <br>
the current command line. When it finishes, the possible
completions are retrieved from the value of the COMPREPLY
array variable. <br>
-G globpat <br>
The pathname expansion pattern globpat is expanded to
generate the possible completions. <br>
-P prefix <br>
prefix is added at the beginning of each possible completion
after all other options have been applied. <br>
-S suffix <br>
suffix is appended to each possible completion after all
other options have been applied. <br>
-W wordlist <br>
The wordlist is split using the characters in the IFS
special variable as delimiters, and each resultant word is
expanded. The possible completions are the mem&acirc; <br>
bers of the resultant list which match the word being
completed. <br>
-X filterpat <br>
filterpat is a pattern as used for pathname expansion. It is
applied to the list of possible completions generated by the
preceding options and arguments, and <br>
each completion matching filterpat is removed from the list.
A leading ! in filterpat negates the pattern; in this case,
any completion not matching filterpat is <br>
removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The return value is true unless
an invalid option is supplied, an option other than -p or -r
is supplied without a name argument, an attempt is made to
remove a completion <br>
specification for a name for which no specification exists,
or an error occurs adding a completion specification.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">compopt [-o option] [-DE] [+o
option] [name] <br>
Modify completion options for each name according to the
options, or for the currently-executing completion if no
names are supplied. If no options are given, display the
<br>
completion options for each name or the current completion.
The possible values of option are those valid for the
complete builtin described above. The -D option indi&acirc;
<br>
cates that the remaining options should apply to the
&lsquo;&lsquo;default&rsquo;&rsquo; command completion; that
is, completion attempted on a command for which no
completion has previously been <br>
defined. The -E option indicates that the remaining options
should apply to &lsquo;&lsquo;empty&rsquo;&rsquo; command
completion; that is, completion attempted on a blank
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The return value is true unless
an invalid option is supplied, an attempt is made to modify
the options for a name for which no completion specification
exists, or an out&acirc; <br>
put error occurs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">continue [n] <br>
Resume the next iteration of the enclosing for, while,
until, or select loop. If n is specified, resume at the nth
enclosing loop. n must be &acirc;&yen; 1. If n is greater
than <br>
the number of enclosing loops, the last enclosing loop (the
&lsquo;&lsquo;top-level&rsquo;&rsquo; loop) is resumed. The
return value is 0 unless n is not greater than or equal to
1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">declare [-aAfFgilnrtux] [-p]
[name[=value] ...] <br>
typeset [-aAfFgilnrtux] [-p] [name[=value] ...] <br>
Declare variables and/or give them attributes. If no names
are given then display the values of variables. The -p
option will display the attributes and values of each <br>
name. When -p is used with name arguments, additional
options, other than -f and -F, are ignored. When -p is
supplied without name arguments, it will display the <br>
attributes and values of all variables having the attributes
specified by the additional options. If no other options are
supplied with -p, declare will display the <br>
attributes and values of all shell variables. The -f option
will restrict the display to shell functions. The -F option
inhibits the display of function definitions; <br>
only the function name and attributes are printed. If the
extdebug shell option is enabled using shopt, the source
file name and line number where the function is defined <br>
are displayed as well. The -F option implies -f. The -g
option forces variables to be created or modified at the
global scope, even when declare is executed in a shell <br>
function. It is ignored in all other cases. The following
options can be used to restrict output to variables with the
specified attribute or to give variables <br>
attributes: <br>
-a Each name is an indexed array variable (see Arrays
above). <br>
-A Each name is an associative array variable (see Arrays
above). <br>
-f Use function names only. <br>
-i The variable is treated as an integer; arithmetic
evaluation (see ARITHMETIC EVALUATION above) is performed
when the variable is assigned a value. <br>
-l When the variable is assigned a value, all upper-case
characters are converted to lower-case. The upper-case
attribute is disabled. <br>
-n Give each name the nameref attribute, making it a name
reference to another variable. That other variable is
defined by the value of name. All references and <br>
assignments to name, except for changing the -n attribute
itself, are performed on the variable referenced by
name&rsquo;s value. The -n attribute cannot be applied to
<br>
array variables. <br>
-r Make names readonly. These names cannot then be assigned
values by subsequent assignment statements or unset. <br>
-t Give each name the trace attribute. Traced functions
inherit the DEBUG and RETURN traps from the calling shell.
The trace attribute has no special meaning for <br>
variables. <br>
-u When the variable is assigned a value, all lower-case
characters are converted to upper-case. The lower-case
attribute is disabled. <br>
-x Mark names for export to subsequent commands via the
environment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using &lsquo;+&rsquo; instead of
&lsquo;-&rsquo; turns off the attribute instead, with the
exceptions that +a may not be used to destroy an array
variable and +r will not remove the readonly <br>
attribute. When used in a function, declare and typeset make
each name local, as with the local command, unless the -g
option is supplied. If a variable name is followed <br>
by =value, the value of the variable is set to value. When
using -a or -A and the compound assignment syntax to create
array variables, additional attributes do not take <br>
effect until subsequent assignments. The return value is 0
unless an invalid option is encountered, an attempt is made
to define a function using &lsquo;&lsquo;-f
foo=bar&rsquo;&rsquo;, an <br>
attempt is made to assign a value to a readonly variable, an
attempt is made to assign a value to an array variable
without using the compound assignment syntax (see <br>
Arrays above), one of the names is not a valid shell
variable name, an attempt is made to turn off readonly
status for a readonly variable, an attempt is made to turn
off <br>
array status for an array variable, or an attempt is made to
display a non-existent function with -f.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dirs [-clpv] [+n] [-n] <br>
Without options, displays the list of currently remembered
directories. The default display is on a single line with
directory names separated by spaces. Directories are <br>
added to the list with the pushd command; the popd command
removes entries from the list. <br>
-c Clears the directory stack by deleting all of the
entries. <br>
-l Produces a listing using full pathnames; the default
listing format uses a tilde to denote the home directory.
<br>
-p Print the directory stack with one entry per line. <br>
-v Print the directory stack with one entry per line,
prefixing each entry with its index in the stack. <br>
+n Displays the nth entry counting from the left of the list
shown by dirs when invoked without options, starting with
zero. <br>
-n Displays the nth entry counting from the right of the
list shown by dirs when invoked without options, starting
with zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The return value is 0 unless an
invalid option is supplied or n indexes beyond the end of
the directory stack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">disown [-ar] [-h] [jobspec ...]
<br>
Without options, remove each jobspec from the table of
active jobs. If jobspec is not present, and neither the -a
nor the -r option is supplied, the current job is used. <br>
If the -h option is given, each jobspec is not removed from
the table, but is marked so that SIGHUP is not sent to the
job if the shell receives a SIGHUP. If no jobspec <br>
is supplied, the -a option means to remove or mark all jobs;
the -r option without a jobspec argument restricts operation
to running jobs. The return value is 0 unless a <br>
jobspec does not specify a valid job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">echo [-neE] [arg ...] <br>
Output the args, separated by spaces, followed by a newline.
The return status is 0 unless a write error occurs. If -n is
specified, the trailing newline is suppressed. <br>
If the -e option is given, interpretation of the following
backslash-escaped characters is enabled. The -E option
disables the interpretation of these escape characters, <br>
even on systems where they are interpreted by default. The
xpg_echo shell option may be used to dynamically determine
whether or not echo expands these escape characters <br>
by default. echo does not interpret -- to mean the end of
options. echo interprets the following escape sequences:
<br>
alert (bell) <br>
backspace <br>
\ &nbsp; <br>
an escape character <br>
form feed <br>
new line <br>
carriage return <br>
horizontal tab <br>
vertical tab <br>
\ backslash <br>
nnn the eight-bit character whose value is the octal value
nnn (zero to three octal digits) <br>
the eight-bit character whose value is the hexadecimal value
HH (one or two hex digits) <br>
HHHH the Unicode (ISO/IEC 10646) character whose value is
the hexadecimal value HHHH (one to four hex digits) <br>
UHHHHHHHH <br>
the Unicode (ISO/IEC 10646) character whose value is the
hexadecimal value HHHHHHHH (one to eight hex digits)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">enable [-a] [-dnps] [-f
filename] [name ...] <br>
Enable and disable builtin shell commands. Disabling a
builtin allows a disk command which has the same name as a
shell builtin to be executed without specifying a full <br>
pathname, even though the shell normally searches for
builtins before disk commands. If -n is used, each name is
disabled; otherwise, names are enabled. For example, to <br>
use the test binary found via the PATH instead of the shell
builtin version, run &lsquo;&lsquo;enable -n
test&rsquo;&rsquo;. The -f option means to load the new
builtin command name from shared <br>
object filename, on systems that support dynamic loading.
The -d option will delete a builtin previously loaded with
-f. If no name arguments are given, or if the -p <br>
option is supplied, a list of shell builtins is printed.
With no other option arguments, the list consists of all
enabled shell builtins. If -n is supplied, only dis&acirc;
<br>
abled builtins are printed. If -a is supplied, the list
printed includes all builtins, with an indication of whether
or not each is enabled. If -s is supplied, the out&acirc;
<br>
put is restricted to the POSIX special builtins. The return
value is 0 unless a name is not a shell builtin or there is
an error loading a new builtin from a shared <br>
object.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">eval [arg ...] <br>
The args are read and concatenated together into a single
command. This command is then read and executed by the
shell, and its exit status is returned as the value of <br>
eval. If there are no args, or only null arguments, eval
returns 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">exec [-cl] [-a name] [command
[arguments]] <br>
If command is specified, it replaces the shell. No new
process is created. The arguments become the arguments to
command. If the -l option is supplied, the shell places <br>
a dash at the beginning of the zeroth argument passed to
command. This is what login(1) does. The -c option causes
command to be executed with an empty environment. If <br>
-a is supplied, the shell passes name as the zeroth argument
to the executed command. If command cannot be executed for
some reason, a non-interactive shell exits, unless <br>
the execfail shell option is enabled. In that case, it
returns failure. An interactive shell returns failure if the
file cannot be executed. If command is not speci&acirc; <br>
fied, any redirections take effect in the current shell, and
the return status is 0. If there is a redirection error, the
return status is 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">exit [n] <br>
Cause the shell to exit with a status of n. If n is omitted,
the exit status is that of the last command executed. A trap
on EXIT is executed before the shell termi&acirc; <br>
nates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">export [-fn] [name[=word]] ...
<br>
export -p <br>
The supplied names are marked for automatic export to the
environment of subsequently executed commands. If the -f
option is given, the names refer to functions. If no <br>
names are given, or if the -p option is supplied, a list of
names of all exported variables is printed. The -n option
causes the export property to be removed from each <br>
name. If a variable name is followed by =word, the value of
the variable is set to word. export returns an exit status
of 0 unless an invalid option is encountered, one <br>
of the names is not a valid shell variable name, or -f is
supplied with a name that is not a function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fc [-e ename] [-lnr] [first]
[last] <br>
fc -s [pat=rep] [cmd] <br>
The first form selects a range of commands from first to
last from the history list and displays or edits and
re-executes them. First and last may be specified as a <br>
string (to locate the last command beginning with that
string) or as a number (an index into the history list,
where a negative number is used as an offset from the
cur&acirc; <br>
rent command number). If last is not specified it is set to
the current command for listing (so that &lsquo;&lsquo;fc -l
-10&rsquo;&rsquo; prints the last 10 commands) and to first
otherwise. <br>
If first is not specified it is set to the previous command
for editing and -16 for listing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -n option suppresses the
command numbers when listing. The -r option reverses the
order of the commands. If the -l option is given, the
commands are listed on stan&acirc; <br>
dard output. Otherwise, the editor given by ename is invoked
on a file containing those commands. If ename is not given,
the value of the FCEDIT variable is used, and <br>
the value of EDITOR if FCEDIT is not set. If neither
variable is set, vi is used. When editing is complete, the
edited commands are echoed and executed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the second form, command is
re-executed after each instance of pat is replaced by rep.
Command is intepreted the same as first above. A useful
alias to use with this <br>
is &lsquo;&lsquo;r=&quot;fc -s&quot;&rsquo;&rsquo;, so that
typing &lsquo;&lsquo;r cc&rsquo;&rsquo; runs the last
command beginning with &lsquo;&lsquo;cc&rsquo;&rsquo; and
typing &lsquo;&lsquo;r&rsquo;&rsquo; re-executes the last
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the first form is used, the
return value is 0 unless an invalid option is encountered or
first or last specify history lines out of range. If the -e
option is sup&acirc; <br>
plied, the return value is the value of the last command
executed or failure if an error occurs with the temporary
file of commands. If the second form is used, the <br>
return status is that of the command re-executed, unless cmd
does not specify a valid history line, in which case fc
returns failure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fg [jobspec] <br>
Resume jobspec in the foreground, and make it the current
job. If jobspec is not present, the shell&rsquo;s notion of
the current job is used. The return value is that of the
<br>
command placed into the foreground, or failure if run when
job control is disabled or, when run with job control
enabled, if jobspec does not specify a valid job or
job&acirc; <br>
spec specifies a job that was started without job
control.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">getopts optstring name [args]
<br>
getopts is used by shell procedures to parse positional
parameters. optstring contains the option characters to be
recognized; if a character is followed by a colon, the <br>
option is expected to have an argument, which should be
separated from it by white space. The colon and question
mark characters may not be used as option characters. <br>
Each time it is invoked, getopts places the next option in
the shell variable name, initializing name if it does not
exist, and the index of the next argument to be pro&acirc;
<br>
cessed into the variable OPTIND. OPTIND is initialized to 1
each time the shell or a shell script is invoked. When an
option requires an argument, getopts places that <br>
argument into the variable OPTARG. The shell does not reset
OPTIND automatically; it must be manually reset between
multiple calls to getopts within the same shell invo&acirc;
<br>
cation if a new set of parameters is to be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the end of options is
encountered, getopts exits with a return value greater than
zero. OPTIND is set to the index of the first non-option
argument, and name is set <br>
to ?.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">getopts normally parses the
positional parameters, but if more arguments are given in
args, getopts parses those instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">getopts can report errors in two
ways. If the first character of optstring is a colon, silent
error reporting is used. In normal operation, diagnostic
messages are <br>
printed when invalid options or missing option arguments are
encountered. If the variable OPTERR is set to 0, no error
messages will be displayed, even if the first char&acirc;
<br>
acter of optstring is not a colon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If an invalid option is seen,
getopts places ? into name and, if not silent, prints an
error message and unsets OPTARG. If getopts is silent, the
option character found <br>
is placed in OPTARG and no diagnostic message is
printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a required argument is not
found, and getopts is not silent, a question mark (?) is
placed in name, OPTARG is unset, and a diagnostic message is
printed. If getopts is <br>
silent, then a colon (:) is placed in name and OPTARG is set
to the option character found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">getopts returns true if an
option, specified or unspecified, is found. It returns false
if the end of options is encountered or an error occurs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hash [-lr] [-p filename] [-dt]
[name] <br>
Each time hash is invoked, the full pathname of the command
name is determined by searching the directories in $PATH and
remembered. Any previously-remembered pathname is <br>
discarded. If the -p option is supplied, no path search is
performed, and filename is used as the full filename of the
command. The -r option causes the shell to forget <br>
all remembered locations. The -d option causes the shell to
forget the remembered location of each name. If the -t
option is supplied, the full pathname to which each <br>
name corresponds is printed. If multiple name arguments are
supplied with -t, the name is printed before the hashed full
pathname. The -l option causes output to be dis&acirc; <br>
played in a format that may be reused as input. If no
arguments are given, or if only -l is supplied, information
about remembered commands is printed. The return status <br>
is true unless a name is not found or an invalid option is
supplied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">help [-dms] [pattern] <br>
Display helpful information about builtin commands. If
pattern is specified, help gives detailed help on all
commands matching pattern; otherwise help for all the <br>
builtins and shell control structures is printed. <br>
-d Display a short description of each pattern <br>
-m Display the description of each pattern in a manpage-like
format <br>
-s Display only a short usage synopsis for each pattern</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The return status is 0 unless no
command matches pattern.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">history [n] <br>
history -c <br>
history -d offset <br>
history -anrw [filename] <br>
history -p arg [arg ...] <br>
history -s arg [arg ...] <br>
With no options, display the command history list with line
numbers. Lines listed with a * have been modified. An
argument of n lists only the last n lines. If the <br>
shell variable HISTTIMEFORMAT is set and not null, it is
used as a format string for strftime(3) to display the time
stamp associated with each displayed history entry. <br>
No intervening blank is printed between the formatted time
stamp and the history line. If filename is supplied, it is
used as the name of the history file; if not, the <br>
value of HISTFILE is used. Options, if supplied, have the
following meanings: <br>
-c Clear the history list by deleting all the entries. <br>
-d offset <br>
Delete the history entry at position offset. <br>
-a Append the &lsquo;&lsquo;new&rsquo;&rsquo; history lines
(history lines entered since the beginning of the current
bash session) to the history file. <br>
-n Read the history lines not already read from the history
file into the current history list. These are lines appended
to the history file since the beginning of <br>
the current bash session. <br>
-r Read the contents of the history file and append them to
the current history list. <br>
-w Write the current history list to the history file,
overwriting the history file&rsquo;s contents. <br>
-p Perform history substitution on the following args and
display the result on the standard output. Does not store
the results in the history list. Each arg must be <br>
quoted to disable normal history expansion. <br>
-s Store the args in the history list as a single entry. The
last command in the history list is removed before the args
are added.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the HISTTIMEFORMAT variable
is set, the time stamp information associated with each
history entry is written to the history file, marked with
the history comment char&acirc; <br>
acter. When the history file is read, lines beginning with
the history comment character followed immediately by a
digit are interpreted as timestamps for the previous <br>
history line. The return value is 0 unless an invalid option
is encountered, an error occurs while reading or writing the
history file, an invalid offset is supplied as <br>
an argument to -d, or the history expansion supplied as an
argument to -p fails.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">jobs [-lnprs] [ jobspec ... ]
<br>
jobs -x command [ args ... ] <br>
The first form lists the active jobs. The options have the
following meanings: <br>
-l List process IDs in addition to the normal information.
<br>
-n Display information only about jobs that have changed
status since the user was last notified of their status.
<br>
-p List only the process ID of the job&rsquo;s process group
leader. <br>
-r Display only running jobs. <br>
-s Display only stopped jobs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If jobspec is given, output is
restricted to information about that job. The return status
is 0 unless an invalid option is encountered or an invalid
jobspec is supplied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -x option is supplied,
jobs replaces any jobspec found in command or args with the
corresponding process group ID, and executes command passing
it args, returning <br>
its exit status.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kill [-s sigspec | -n signum |
-sigspec] [pid | jobspec] ... <br>
kill -l [sigspec | exit_status] <br>
Send the signal named by sigspec or signum to the processes
named by pid or jobspec. sigspec is either a
case-insensitive signal name such as SIGKILL (with or
without the <br>
SIG prefix) or a signal number; signum is a signal number.
If sigspec is not present, then SIGTERM is assumed. An
argument of -l lists the signal names. If any argu&acirc;
<br>
ments are supplied when -l is given, the names of the
signals corresponding to the arguments are listed, and the
return status is 0. The exit_status argument to -l is a <br>
number specifying either a signal number or the exit status
of a process terminated by a signal. kill returns true if at
least one signal was successfully sent, or false <br>
if an error occurs or an invalid option is encountered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">let arg [arg ...] <br>
Each arg is an arithmetic expression to be evaluated (see
ARITHMETIC EVALUATION above). If the last arg evaluates to
0, let returns 1; 0 is returned otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">local [option] [name[=value]
...] <br>
For each argument, a local variable named name is created,
and assigned value. The option can be any of the options
accepted by declare. When local is used within a <br>
function, it causes the variable name to have a visible
scope restricted to that function and its children. With no
operands, local writes a list of local variables to <br>
the standard output. It is an error to use local when not
within a function. The return status is 0 unless local is
used outside a function, an invalid name is supplied, <br>
or name is a readonly variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">logout Exit a login shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mapfile [-n count] [-O origin]
[-s count] [-t] [-u fd] [-C callback] [-c quantum] [array]
<br>
readarray [-n count] [-O origin] [-s count] [-t] [-u fd] [-C
callback] [-c quantum] [array] <br>
Read lines from the standard input into the indexed array
variable array, or from file descriptor fd if the -u option
is supplied. The variable MAPFILE is the default <br>
array. Options, if supplied, have the following meanings:
<br>
-n Copy at most count lines. If count is 0, all lines are
copied. <br>
-O Begin assigning to array at index origin. The default
index is 0. <br>
-s Discard the first count lines read. <br>
-t Remove a trailing newline from each line read. <br>
-u Read lines from file descriptor fd instead of the
standard input. <br>
-C Evaluate callback each time quantum lines are read. The
-c option specifies quantum. <br>
-c Specify the number of lines read between each call to
callback.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If -C is specified without -c,
the default quantum is 5000. When callback is evaluated, it
is supplied the index of the next array element to be
assigned and the line to <br>
be assigned to that element as additional arguments.
callback is evaluated after the line is read but before the
array element is assigned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If not supplied with an explicit
origin, mapfile will clear array before assigning to it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mapfile returns successfully
unless an invalid option or option argument is supplied,
array is invalid or unassignable, or if array is not an
indexed array.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">popd [-n] [+n] [-n] <br>
Removes entries from the directory stack. With no arguments,
removes the top directory from the stack, and performs a cd
to the new top directory. Arguments, if sup&acirc; <br>
plied, have the following meanings: <br>
-n Suppresses the normal change of directory when removing
directories from the stack, so that only the stack is
manipulated. <br>
+n Removes the nth entry counting from the left of the list
shown by dirs, starting with zero. For example:
&lsquo;&lsquo;popd +0&rsquo;&rsquo; removes the first
directory, &lsquo;&lsquo;popd +1&rsquo;&rsquo; the <br>
second. <br>
-n Removes the nth entry counting from the right of the list
shown by dirs, starting with zero. For example:
&lsquo;&lsquo;popd -0&rsquo;&rsquo; removes the last
directory, &lsquo;&lsquo;popd -1&rsquo;&rsquo; the <br>
next to last.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the popd command is
successful, a dirs is performed as well, and the return
status is 0. popd returns false if an invalid option is
encountered, the directory stack is <br>
empty, a non-existent directory stack entry is specified, or
the directory change fails.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">printf [-v var] format
[arguments] <br>
Write the formatted arguments to the standard output under
the control of the format. The -v option causes the output
to be assigned to the variable var rather than being <br>
printed to the standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The format is a character string
which contains three types of objects: plain characters,
which are simply copied to standard output, character escape
sequences, which are <br>
converted and copied to the standard output, and format
specifications, each of which causes printing of the next
successive argument. In addition to the standard <br>
printf(1) format specifications, printf interprets the
following extensions: <br>
%b causes printf to expand backslash escape sequences in the
corresponding argument (except that and octal escapes
beginning with may contain up to four digits). <br>
%q causes printf to output the corresponding argument in a
format that can be reused as shell input. <br>
%(datefmt)T <br>
causes printf to output the date-time string resulting from
using datefmt as a format string for strftime(3). The
corresponding argument is an integer representing <br>
the number of seconds since the epoch. Two special argument
values may be used: -1 represents the current time, and -2
represents the time the shell was invoked. <br>
If no argument is specified, conversion behaves as if -1 had
been given. This is an exception to the usual printf
behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Arguments to non-string format
specifiers are treated as C constants, except that a leading
plus or minus sign is allowed, and if the leading character
is a single or dou&acirc; <br>
ble quote, the value is the ASCII value of the following
character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The format is reused as
necessary to consume all of the arguments. If the format
requires more arguments than are supplied, the extra format
specifications behave as if a <br>
zero value or null string, as appropriate, had been
supplied. The return value is zero on success, non-zero on
failure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pushd [-n] [+n] [-n] <br>
pushd [-n] [dir] <br>
Adds a directory to the top of the directory stack, or
rotates the stack, making the new top of the stack the
current working directory. With no arguments, exchanges the
<br>
top two directories and returns 0, unless the directory
stack is empty. Arguments, if supplied, have the following
meanings: <br>
-n Suppresses the normal change of directory when adding
directories to the stack, so that only the stack is
manipulated. <br>
+n Rotates the stack so that the nth directory (counting
from the left of the list shown by dirs, starting with zero)
is at the top. <br>
-n Rotates the stack so that the nth directory (counting
from the right of the list shown by dirs, starting with
zero) is at the top. <br>
dir Adds dir to the directory stack at the top, making it
the new current working directory as if it had been supplied
as the argument to the cd builtin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the pushd command is
successful, a dirs is performed as well. If the first form
is used, pushd returns 0 unless the cd to dir fails. With
the second form, pushd <br>
returns 0 unless the directory stack is empty, a
non-existent directory stack element is specified, or the
directory change to the specified new current directory
fails.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pwd [-LP] <br>
Print the absolute pathname of the current working
directory. The pathname printed contains no symbolic links
if the -P option is supplied or the -o physical option to
<br>
the set builtin command is enabled. If the -L option is
used, the pathname printed may contain symbolic links. The
return status is 0 unless an error occurs while read&acirc;
<br>
ing the name of the current directory or an invalid option
is supplied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">read [-ers] [-a aname] [-d
delim] [-i text] [-n nchars] [-N nchars] [-p prompt] [-t
timeout] [-u fd] [name ...] <br>
One line is read from the standard input, or from the file
descriptor fd supplied as an argument to the -u option, and
the first word is assigned to the first name, the <br>
second word to the second name, and so on, with leftover
words and their intervening separators assigned to the last
name. If there are fewer words read from the input <br>
stream than names, the remaining names are assigned empty
values. The characters in IFS are used to split the line
into words using the same rules the shell uses for <br>
expansion (described above under Word Splitting). The
backslash character ( may be used to remove any special
meaning for the next character read and for line
continua&acirc; <br>
tion. Options, if supplied, have the following meanings:
<br>
-a aname <br>
The words are assigned to sequential indices of the array
variable aname, starting at 0. aname is unset before any new
values are assigned. Other name arguments <br>
are ignored. <br>
-d delim <br>
The first character of delim is used to terminate the input
line, rather than newline. <br>
-e If the standard input is coming from a terminal, readline
(see READLINE above) is used to obtain the line. Readline
uses the current (or default, if line editing <br>
was not previously active) editing settings. <br>
-i text <br>
If readline is being used to read the line, text is placed
into the editing buffer before editing begins. <br>
-n nchars <br>
read returns after reading nchars characters rather than
waiting for a complete line of input, but honor a delimiter
if fewer than nchars characters are read before <br>
the delimiter. <br>
-N nchars <br>
read returns after reading exactly nchars characters rather
than waiting for a complete line of input, unless EOF is
encountered or read times out. Delimiter char&acirc; <br>
acters encountered in the input are not treated specially
and do not cause read to return until nchars characters are
read. <br>
-p prompt <br>
Display prompt on standard error, without a trailing
newline, before attempting to read any input. The prompt is
displayed only if input is coming from a terminal. <br>
-r Backslash does not act as an escape character. The
backslash is considered to be part of the line. In
particular, a backslash-newline pair may not be used as a
<br>
line continuation. <br>
-s Silent mode. If input is coming from a terminal,
characters are not echoed. <br>
-t timeout <br>
Cause read to time out and return failure if a complete line
of input (or a specified number of characters) is not read
within timeout seconds. timeout may be a <br>
decimal number with a fractional portion following the
decimal point. This option is only effective if read is
reading input from a terminal, pipe, or other spe&acirc;
<br>
cial file; it has no effect when reading from regular files.
If read times out, read saves any partial input read into
the specified variable name. If timeout is <br>
0, read returns immediately, without trying to read any
data. The exit status is 0 if input is available on the
specified file descriptor, non-zero otherwise. The <br>
exit status is greater than 128 if the timeout is exceeded.
<br>
-u fd Read input from file descriptor fd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no names are supplied, the
line read is assigned to the variable REPLY. The return code
is zero, unless end-of-file is encountered, read times out
(in which case the <br>
return code is greater than 128), a variable assignment
error (such as assigning to a readonly variable) occurs, or
an invalid file descriptor is supplied as the argument <br>
to -u.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">readonly [-aAf] [-p]
[name[=word] ...] <br>
The given names are marked readonly; the values of these
names may not be changed by subsequent assignment. If the -f
option is supplied, the functions corresponding to <br>
the names are so marked. The -a option restricts the
variables to indexed arrays; the -A option restricts the
variables to associative arrays. If both options are
sup&acirc; <br>
plied, -A takes precedence. If no name arguments are given,
or if the -p option is supplied, a list of all readonly
names is printed. The other options may be used to <br>
restrict the output to a subset of the set of readonly
names. The -p option causes output to be displayed in a
format that may be reused as input. If a variable name is
<br>
followed by =word, the value of the variable is set to word.
The return status is 0 unless an invalid option is
encountered, one of the names is not a valid shell
vari&acirc; <br>
able name, or -f is supplied with a name that is not a
function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">return [n] <br>
Causes a function to stop executing and return the value
specified by n to its caller. If n is omitted, the return
status is that of the last command executed in the <br>
function body. If return is used outside a function, but
during execution of a script by the . (source) command, it
causes the shell to stop executing that script and <br>
return either n or the exit status of the last command
executed within the script as the exit status of the script.
If n is supplied, the return value is its least sig&acirc;
<br>
nificant 8 bits. The return status is non-zero if return is
supplied a non-numeric argument, or is used outside a
function and not during execution of a script by . or <br>
source. Any command associated with the RETURN trap is
executed before execution resumes after the function or
script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set [--abefhkmnptuvxBCEHPT] [-o
option-name] [arg ...] <br>
set [+abefhkmnptuvxBCEHPT] [+o option-name] [arg ...] <br>
Without options, the name and value of each shell variable
are displayed in a format that can be reused as input for
setting or resetting the currently-set variables. <br>
Read-only variables cannot be reset. In posix mode, only
shell variables are listed. The output is sorted according
to the current locale. When options are specified, <br>
they set or unset shell attributes. Any arguments remaining
after option processing are treated as values for the
positional parameters and are assigned, in order, to $1,
<br>
$2, ... $n. Options, if specified, have the following
meanings: <br>
-a Automatically mark variables and functions which are
modified or created for export to the environment of
subsequent commands. <br>
-b Report the status of terminated background jobs
immediately, rather than before the next primary prompt.
This is effective only when job control is enabled. <br>
-e Exit immediately if a pipeline (which may consist of a
single simple command), a list, or a compound command (see
SHELL GRAMMAR above), exits with a non-zero sta&acirc; <br>
tus. The shell does not exit if the command that fails is
part of the command list immediately following a while or
until keyword, part of the test following the <br>
if or elif reserved words, part of any command executed in a
&amp;&amp; or || list except the command following the final
&amp;&amp; or ||, any command in a pipeline but the last,
<br>
or if the command&rsquo;s return value is being inverted
with !. If a compound command other than a subshell returns
a non-zero status because a command failed while -e <br>
was being ignored, the shell does not exit. A trap on ERR,
if set, is executed before the shell exits. This option
applies to the shell environment and each sub&acirc; <br>
shell environment separately (see COMMAND EXECUTION
ENVIRONMENT above), and may cause subshells to exit before
executing all the commands in the subshell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a compound command or shell
function executes in a context where -e is being ignored,
none of the commands executed within the compound command or
function body <br>
will be affected by the -e setting, even if -e is set and a
command returns a failure status. If a compound command or
shell function sets -e while executing in a <br>
context where -e is ignored, that setting will not have any
effect until the compound command or the command containing
the function call completes. <br>
-f Disable pathname expansion. <br>
-h Remember the location of commands as they are looked up
for execution. This is enabled by default. <br>
-k All arguments in the form of assignment statements are
placed in the environment for a command, not just those that
precede the command name. <br>
-m Monitor mode. Job control is enabled. This option is on
by default for interactive shells on systems that support it
(see JOB CONTROL above). All processes run <br>
in a separate process group. When a background job
completes, the shell prints a line containing its exit
status. <br>
-n Read commands but do not execute them. This may be used
to check a shell script for syntax errors. This is ignored
by interactive shells. <br>
-o option-name <br>
The option-name can be one of the following: <br>
allexport <br>
Same as -a. <br>
braceexpand <br>
Same as -B. <br>
emacs Use an emacs-style command line editing interface.
This is enabled by default when the shell is interactive,
unless the shell is started with the <br>
--noediting option. This also affects the editing interface
used for read -e. <br>
errexit Same as -e. <br>
errtrace <br>
Same as -E. <br>
functrace <br>
Same as -T. <br>
hashall Same as -h. <br>
histexpand <br>
Same as -H. <br>
history Enable command history, as described above under
HISTORY. This option is on by default in interactive shells.
<br>
ignoreeof <br>
The effect is as if the shell command
&lsquo;&lsquo;IGNOREEOF=10&rsquo;&rsquo; had been executed
(see Shell Variables above). <br>
keyword Same as -k. <br>
monitor Same as -m. <br>
noclobber <br>
Same as -C. <br>
noexec Same as -n. <br>
noglob Same as -f. <br>
nolog Currently ignored. <br>
notify Same as -b. <br>
nounset Same as -u. <br>
onecmd Same as -t. <br>
physical <br>
Same as -P. <br>
pipefail <br>
If set, the return value of a pipeline is the value of the
last (rightmost) command to exit with a non-zero status, or
zero if all commands in the pipeline <br>
exit successfully. This option is disabled by default. <br>
posix Change the behavior of bash where the default
operation differs from the POSIX standard to match the
standard (posix mode). See SEE ALSO below for a ref&acirc;
<br>
erence to a document that details how posix mode affects
bash&rsquo;s behavior. <br>
privileged <br>
Same as -p. <br>
verbose Same as -v. <br>
vi Use a vi-style command line editing interface. This also
affects the editing interface used for read -e. <br>
xtrace Same as -x. <br>
If -o is supplied with no option-name, the values of the
current options are printed. If +o is supplied with no
option-name, a series of set commands to recreate <br>
the current option settings is displayed on the standard
output. <br>
-p Turn on privileged mode. In this mode, the $ENV and
$BASH_ENV files are not processed, shell functions are not
inherited from the environment, and the SHELLOPTS, <br>
BASHOPTS, CDPATH, and GLOBIGNORE variables, if they appear
in the environment, are ignored. If the shell is started
with the effective user (group) id not equal <br>
to the real user (group) id, and the -p option is not
supplied, these actions are taken and the effective user id
is set to the real user id. If the -p option is <br>
supplied at startup, the effective user id is not reset.
Turning this option off causes the effective user and group
ids to be set to the real user and group ids. <br>
-t Exit after reading and executing one command. <br>
-u Treat unset variables and parameters other than the
special parameters &quot;@&quot; and &quot;*&quot; as an
error when performing parameter expansion. If expansion is
attempted on <br>
an unset variable or parameter, the shell prints an error
message, and, if not interactive, exits with a non-zero
status. <br>
-v Print shell input lines as they are read. <br>
-x After expanding each simple command, for command, case
command, select command, or arithmetic for command, display
the expanded value of PS4, followed by the com&acirc; <br>
mand and its expanded arguments or associated word list.
<br>
-B The shell performs brace expansion (see Brace Expansion
above). This is on by default. <br>
-C If set, bash does not overwrite an existing file with the
&gt;, &gt;&amp;, and &lt;&gt; redirection operators. This
may be overridden when creating output files by using the
re&acirc; <br>
direction operator &gt;| instead of &gt;. <br>
-E If set, any trap on ERR is inherited by shell functions,
command substitutions, and commands executed in a subshell
environment. The ERR trap is normally not <br>
inherited in such cases. <br>
-H Enable ! style history substitution. This option is on by
default when the shell is interactive. <br>
-P If set, the shell does not resolve symbolic links when
executing commands such as cd that change the current
working directory. It uses the physical directory <br>
structure instead. By default, bash follows the logical
chain of directories when performing commands which change
the current directory. <br>
-T If set, any traps on DEBUG and RETURN are inherited by
shell functions, command substitutions, and commands
executed in a subshell environment. The DEBUG and <br>
RETURN traps are normally not inherited in such cases. <br>
-- If no arguments follow this option, then the positional
parameters are unset. Otherwise, the positional parameters
are set to the args, even if some of them begin <br>
with a -. <br>
- Signal the end of options, cause all remaining args to be
assigned to the positional parameters. The -x and -v options
are turned off. If there are no args, the <br>
positional parameters remain unchanged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The options are off by default
unless otherwise noted. Using + rather than - causes these
options to be turned off. The options can also be specified
as arguments to an <br>
invocation of the shell. The current set of options may be
found in $-. The return status is always true unless an
invalid option is encountered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">shift [n] <br>
The positional parameters from n+1 ... are renamed to $1
.... Parameters represented by the numbers $# down to $#-n+1
are unset. n must be a non-negative number less <br>
than or equal to $#. If n is 0, no parameters are changed.
If n is not given, it is assumed to be 1. If n is greater
than $#, the positional parameters are not changed. <br>
The return status is greater than zero if n is greater than
$# or less than zero; otherwise 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">shopt [-pqsu] [-o] [optname ...]
<br>
Toggle the values of settings controlling optional shell
behavior. The settings can be either those listed below, or,
if the -o option is used, those available with the <br>
-o option to the set builtin command. With no options, or
with the -p option, a list of all settable options is
displayed, with an indication of whether or not each is <br>
set. The -p option causes output to be displayed in a form
that may be reused as input. Other options have the
following meanings: <br>
-s Enable (set) each optname. <br>
-u Disable (unset) each optname. <br>
-q Suppresses normal output (quiet mode); the return status
indicates whether the optname is set or unset. If multiple
optname arguments are given with -q, the return <br>
status is zero if all optnames are enabled; non-zero
otherwise. <br>
-o Restricts the values of optname to be those defined for
the -o option to the set builtin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If either -s or -u is used with
no optname arguments, shopt shows only those options which
are set or unset, respectively. Unless otherwise noted, the
shopt options are <br>
disabled (unset) by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The return status when listing
options is zero if all optnames are enabled, non-zero
otherwise. When setting or unsetting options, the return
status is zero unless an <br>
optname is not a valid shell option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The list of shopt options
is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">autocd If set, a command name
that is the name of a directory is executed as if it were
the argument to the cd command. This option is only used by
interactive shells. <br>
cdable_vars <br>
If set, an argument to the cd builtin command that is not a
directory is assumed to be the name of a variable whose
value is the directory to change to. <br>
cdspell If set, minor errors in the spelling of a directory
component in a cd command will be corrected. The errors
checked for are transposed characters, a missing char&acirc;
<br>
acter, and one character too many. If a correction is found,
the corrected filename is printed, and the command proceeds.
This option is only used by interactive <br>
shells. <br>
checkhash <br>
If set, bash checks that a command found in the hash table
exists before trying to execute it. If a hashed command no
longer exists, a normal path search is per&acirc; <br>
formed. <br>
checkjobs <br>
If set, bash lists the status of any stopped and running
jobs before exiting an interactive shell. If any jobs are
running, this causes the exit to be deferred <br>
until a second exit is attempted without an intervening
command (see JOB CONTROL above). The shell always postpones
exiting if any jobs are stopped. <br>
checkwinsize <br>
If set, bash checks the window size after each command and,
if necessary, updates the values of LINES and COLUMNS. <br>
cmdhist If set, bash attempts to save all lines of a
multiple-line command in the same history entry. This allows
easy re-editing of multi-line commands. <br>
compat31 <br>
If set, bash changes its behavior to that of version 3.1
with respect to quoted arguments to the [[ conditional
command&rsquo;s =~ operator and locale-specific string <br>
comparison when using the [[ conditional command&rsquo;s
&lt; and &gt; operators. Bash versions prior to bash-4.1 use
ASCII collation and strcmp(3); bash-4.1 and later use <br>
the current locale&rsquo;s collation sequence and
strcoll(3). <br>
compat32 <br>
If set, bash changes its behavior to that of version 3.2
with respect to locale-specific string comparison when using
the [[ conditional command&rsquo;s &lt; and &gt;
opera&acirc; <br>
tors (see previous item). <br>
compat40 <br>
If set, bash changes its behavior to that of version 4.0
with respect to locale-specific string comparison when using
the [[ conditional command&rsquo;s &lt; and &gt;
opera&acirc; <br>
tors (see description of compat31) and the effect of
interrupting a command list. Bash versions 4.0 and later
interrupt the list as if the shell received the <br>
interrupt; previous versions continue with the next command
in the list. <br>
compat41 <br>
If set, bash, when in posix mode, treats a single quote in a
double-quoted parameter expansion as a special character.
The single quotes must match (an even num&acirc; <br>
ber) and the characters between the single quotes are
considered quoted. This is the behavior of posix mode
through version 4.1. The default bash behavior <br>
remains as in previous versions. <br>
compat42 <br>
If set, bash does not process the replacement string in the
pattern substitution word expansion using quote removal.
<br>
complete_fullquote <br>
If set, bash quotes all shell metacharacters in filenames
and directory names when performing completion. If not set,
bash removes metacharacters such as the dol&acirc; <br>
lar sign from the set of characters that will be quoted in
completed filenames when these metacharacters appear in
shell variable references in words to be com&acirc; <br>
pleted. This means that dollar signs in variable names that
expand to directories will not be quoted; however, any
dollar signs appearing in filenames will not be <br>
quoted, either. This is active only when bash is using
backslashes to quote completed filenames. This variable is
set by default, which is the default bash <br>
behavior in versions through 4.2. <br>
direxpand <br>
If set, bash replaces directory names with the results of
word expansion when performing filename completion. This
changes the contents of the readline editing <br>
buffer. If not set, bash attempts to preserve what the user
typed. <br>
dirspell <br>
If set, bash attempts spelling correction on directory names
during word completion if the directory name initially
supplied does not exist. <br>
dotglob If set, bash includes filenames beginning with a
&lsquo;.&rsquo; in the results of pathname expansion. <br>
execfail <br>
If set, a non-interactive shell will not exit if it cannot
execute the file specified as an argument to the exec
builtin command. An interactive shell does not <br>
exit if exec fails. <br>
expand_aliases <br>
If set, aliases are expanded as described above under
ALIASES. This option is enabled by default for interactive
shells. <br>
extdebug <br>
If set, behavior intended for use by debuggers is enabled:
<br>
1. The -F option to the declare builtin displays the source
file name and line number corresponding to each function
name supplied as an argument. <br>
2. If the command run by the DEBUG trap returns a non-zero
value, the next command is skipped and not executed. <br>
3. If the command run by the DEBUG trap returns a value of
2, and the shell is executing in a subroutine (a shell
function or a shell script executed by the . <br>
or source builtins), a call to return is simulated. <br>
4. BASH_ARGC and BASH_ARGV are updated as described in their
descriptions above. <br>
5. Function tracing is enabled: command substitution, shell
functions, and subshells invoked with ( command ) inherit
the DEBUG and RETURN traps. <br>
6. Error tracing is enabled: command substitution, shell
functions, and subshells invoked with ( command ) inherit
the ERR trap. <br>
extglob If set, the extended pattern matching features
described above under Pathname Expansion are enabled. <br>
extquote <br>
If set, $&rsquo;string&rsquo; and $&quot;string&quot;
quoting is performed within ${parameter} expansions enclosed
in double quotes. This option is enabled by default. <br>
failglob <br>
If set, patterns which fail to match filenames during
pathname expansion result in an expansion error. <br>
force_fignore <br>
If set, the suffixes specified by the FIGNORE shell variable
cause words to be ignored when performing word completion
even if the ignored words are the only pos&acirc; <br>
sible completions. See SHELL VARIABLES above for a
description of FIGNORE. This option is enabled by default.
<br>
globasciiranges <br>
If set, range expressions used in pattern matching bracket
expressions (see Pattern Matching above) behave as if in the
traditional C locale when performing com&acirc; <br>
parisons. That is, the current locale&rsquo;s collating
sequence is not taken into account, so b will not collate
between A and B, and upper-case and lower-case ASCII <br>
characters will collate together. <br>
globstar <br>
If set, the pattern ** used in a pathname expansion context
will match all files and zero or more directories and
subdirectories. If the pattern is followed by a <br>
/, only directories and subdirectories match. <br>
gnu_errfmt <br>
If set, shell error messages are written in the standard GNU
error message format. <br>
histappend <br>
If set, the history list is appended to the file named by
the value of the HISTFILE variable when the shell exits,
rather than overwriting the file. <br>
histreedit <br>
If set, and readline is being used, a user is given the
opportunity to re-edit a failed history substitution. <br>
histverify <br>
If set, and readline is being used, the results of history
substitution are not immediately passed to the shell parser.
Instead, the resulting line is loaded into <br>
the readline editing buffer, allowing further modification.
<br>
hostcomplete <br>
If set, and readline is being used, bash will attempt to
perform hostname completion when a word containing a @ is
being completed (see Completing under READLINE <br>
above). This is enabled by default. <br>
huponexit <br>
If set, bash will send SIGHUP to all jobs when an
interactive login shell exits. <br>
interactive_comments <br>
If set, allow a word beginning with # to cause that word and
all remaining characters on that line to be ignored in an
interactive shell (see COMMENTS above). <br>
This option is enabled by default. <br>
lastpipe <br>
If set, and job control is not active, the shell runs the
last command of a pipeline not executed in the background in
the current shell environment. <br>
lithist If set, and the cmdhist option is enabled,
multi-line commands are saved to the history with embedded
newlines rather than using semicolon separators where
possi&acirc; <br>
ble. <br>
login_shell <br>
The shell sets this option if it is started as a login shell
(see INVOCATION above). The value may not be changed. <br>
mailwarn <br>
If set, and a file that bash is checking for mail has been
accessed since the last time it was checked, the message
&lsquo;&lsquo;The mail in mailfile has been
read&rsquo;&rsquo; is dis&acirc; <br>
played. <br>
no_empty_cmd_completion <br>
If set, and readline is being used, bash will not attempt to
search the PATH for possible completions when completion is
attempted on an empty line. <br>
nocaseglob <br>
If set, bash matches filenames in a case-insensitive fashion
when performing pathname expansion (see Pathname Expansion
above). <br>
nocasematch <br>
If set, bash matches patterns in a case-insensitive fashion
when performing matching while executing case or [[
conditional commands. <br>
nullglob <br>
If set, bash allows patterns which match no files (see
Pathname Expansion above) to expand to a null string, rather
than themselves. <br>
progcomp <br>
If set, the programmable completion facilities (see
Programmable Completion above) are enabled. This option is
enabled by default. <br>
promptvars <br>
If set, prompt strings undergo parameter expansion, command
substitution, arithmetic expansion, and quote removal after
being expanded as described in PROMPTING <br>
above. This option is enabled by default. <br>
restricted_shell <br>
The shell sets this option if it is started in restricted
mode (see RESTRICTED SHELL below). The value may not be
changed. This is not reset when the startup <br>
files are executed, allowing the startup files to discover
whether or not a shell is restricted. <br>
shift_verbose <br>
If set, the shift builtin prints an error message when the
shift count exceeds the number of positional parameters.
<br>
sourcepath <br>
If set, the source (.) builtin uses the value of PATH to
find the directory containing the file supplied as an
argument. This option is enabled by default. <br>
xpg_echo <br>
If set, the echo builtin expands backslash-escape sequences
by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">suspend [-f] <br>
Suspend the execution of this shell until it receives a
SIGCONT signal. A login shell cannot be suspended; the -f
option can be used to override this and force the sus&acirc;
<br>
pension. The return status is 0 unless the shell is a login
shell and -f is not supplied, or if job control is not
enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">test expr <br>
[ expr ] <br>
Return a status of 0 (true) or 1 (false) depending on the
evaluation of the conditional expression expr. Each operator
and operand must be a separate argument. Expres&acirc; <br>
sions are composed of the primaries described above under
CONDITIONAL EXPRESSIONS. test does not accept any options,
nor does it accept and ignore an argument of -- as <br>
signifying the end of options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Expressions may be combined
using the following operators, listed in decreasing order of
precedence. The evaluation depends on the number of
arguments; see below. Opera&acirc; <br>
tor precedence is used when there are five or more
arguments. <br>
! expr True if expr is false. <br>
( expr ) <br>
Returns the value of expr. This may be used to override the
normal precedence of operators. <br>
expr1 -a expr2 <br>
True if both expr1 and expr2 are true. <br>
expr1 -o expr2 <br>
True if either expr1 or expr2 is true.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">test and [ evaluate conditional
expressions using a set of rules based on the number of
arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 arguments <br>
The expression is false. <br>
1 argument <br>
The expression is true if and only if the argument is not
null. <br>
2 arguments <br>
If the first argument is !, the expression is true if and
only if the second argument is null. If the first argument
is one of the unary conditional operators <br>
listed above under CONDITIONAL EXPRESSIONS, the expression
is true if the unary test is true. If the first argument is
not a valid unary conditional operator, the <br>
expression is false. <br>
3 arguments <br>
The following conditions are applied in the order listed. If
the second argument is one of the binary conditional
operators listed above under CONDITIONAL EXPRES&acirc; <br>
SIONS, the result of the expression is the result of the
binary test using the first and third arguments as operands.
The -a and -o operators are considered binary <br>
operators when there are three arguments. If the first
argument is !, the value is the negation of the two-argument
test using the second and third arguments. If <br>
the first argument is exactly ( and the third argument is
exactly ), the result is the one-argument test of the second
argument. Otherwise, the expression is <br>
false. <br>
4 arguments <br>
If the first argument is !, the result is the negation of
the three-argument expression composed of the remaining
arguments. Otherwise, the expression is parsed <br>
and evaluated according to precedence using the rules listed
above. <br>
5 or more arguments <br>
The expression is parsed and evaluated according to
precedence using the rules listed above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When used with test or [, the
&lt; and &gt; operators sort lexicographically using ASCII
ordering.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">times Print the accumulated user
and system times for the shell and for processes run from
the shell. The return status is 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">trap [-lp] [[arg] sigspec ...]
<br>
The command arg is to be read and executed when the shell
receives signal(s) sigspec. If arg is absent (and there is a
single sigspec) or -, each specified signal is <br>
reset to its original disposition (the value it had upon
entrance to the shell). If arg is the null string the signal
specified by each sigspec is ignored by the shell <br>
and by the commands it invokes. If arg is not present and -p
has been supplied, then the trap commands associated with
each sigspec are displayed. If no arguments are <br>
supplied or if only -p is given, trap prints the list of
commands associated with each signal. The -l option causes
the shell to print a list of signal names and their <br>
corresponding numbers. Each sigspec is either a signal name
defined in &lt;signal.h&gt;, or a signal number. Signal
names are case insensitive and the SIG prefix is
optional.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a sigspec is EXIT (0) the
command arg is executed on exit from the shell. If a sigspec
is DEBUG, the command arg is executed before every simple
command, for command, <br>
case command, select command, every arithmetic for command,
and before the first command executes in a shell function
(see SHELL GRAMMAR above). Refer to the description <br>
of the extdebug option to the shopt builtin for details of
its effect on the DEBUG trap. If a sigspec is RETURN, the
command arg is executed each time a shell function or <br>
a script executed with the . or source builtins finishes
executing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a sigspec is ERR, the command
arg is executed whenever a a pipeline (which may consist of
a single simple command), a list, or a compound command
returns a non-zero <br>
exit status, subject to the following conditions. The ERR
trap is not executed if the failed command is part of the
command list immediately following a while or until <br>
keyword, part of the test in an if statement, part of a
command executed in a &amp;&amp; or || list except the
command following the final &amp;&amp; or ||, any command in
a pipeline but <br>
the last, or if the command&rsquo;s return value is being
inverted using !. These are the same conditions obeyed by
the errexit (-e) option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Signals ignored upon entry to
the shell cannot be trapped, reset or listed. Trapped
signals that are not being ignored are reset to their
original values in a subshell or <br>
subshell environment when one is created. The return status
is false if any sigspec is invalid; otherwise trap returns
true.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">type [-aftpP] name [name ...]
<br>
With no options, indicate how each name would be interpreted
if used as a command name. If the -t option is used, type
prints a string which is one of alias, keyword, <br>
function, builtin, or file if name is an alias, shell
reserved word, function, builtin, or disk file,
respectively. If the name is not found, then nothing is
printed, and <br>
an exit status of false is returned. If the -p option is
used, type either returns the name of the disk file that
would be executed if name were specified as a command <br>
name, or nothing if &lsquo;&lsquo;type -t name&rsquo;&rsquo;
would not return file. The -P option forces a PATH search
for each name, even if &lsquo;&lsquo;type -t
name&rsquo;&rsquo; would not return file. If a com&acirc;
<br>
mand is hashed, -p and -P print the hashed value, which is
not necessarily the file that appears first in PATH. If the
-a option is used, type prints all of the places <br>
that contain an executable named name. This includes aliases
and functions, if and only if the -p option is not also
used. The table of hashed commands is not consulted <br>
when using -a. The -f option suppresses shell function
lookup, as with the command builtin. type returns true if
all of the arguments are found, false if any are not <br>
found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ulimit [-HSTabcdefilmnpqrstuvx
[limit]] <br>
Provides control over the resources available to the shell
and to processes started by it, on systems that allow such
control. The -H and -S options specify that the hard <br>
or soft limit is set for the given resource. A hard limit
cannot be increased by a non-root user once it is set; a
soft limit may be increased up to the value of the hard <br>
limit. If neither -H nor -S is specified, both the soft and
hard limits are set. The value of limit can be a number in
the unit specified for the resource or one of the <br>
special values hard, soft, or unlimited, which stand for the
current hard limit, the current soft limit, and no limit,
respectively. If limit is omitted, the current <br>
value of the soft limit of the resource is printed, unless
the -H option is given. When more than one resource is
specified, the limit name and unit are printed before <br>
the value. Other options are interpreted as follows: <br>
-a All current limits are reported <br>
-b The maximum socket buffer size <br>
-c The maximum size of core files created <br>
-d The maximum size of a process&rsquo;s data segment <br>
-e The maximum scheduling priority (&quot;nice&quot;) <br>
-f The maximum size of files written by the shell and its
children <br>
-i The maximum number of pending signals <br>
-l The maximum size that may be locked into memory <br>
-m The maximum resident set size (many systems do not honor
this limit) <br>
-n The maximum number of open file descriptors (most systems
do not allow this value to be set) <br>
-p The pipe size in 512-byte blocks (this may not be set)
<br>
-q The maximum number of bytes in POSIX message queues <br>
-r The maximum real-time scheduling priority <br>
-s The maximum stack size <br>
-t The maximum amount of cpu time in seconds <br>
-u The maximum number of processes available to a single
user <br>
-v The maximum amount of virtual memory available to the
shell and, on some systems, to its children <br>
-x The maximum number of file locks <br>
-T The maximum number of threads</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If limit is given, and the -a
option is not used, limit is the new value of the specified
resource. If no option is given, then -f is assumed. Values
are in 1024-byte <br>
increments, except for -t, which is in seconds; -p, which is
in units of 512-byte blocks; and -T, -b, -n, and -u, which
are unscaled values. The return status is 0 unless <br>
an invalid option or argument is supplied, or an error
occurs while setting a new limit. In POSIX Mode 512-byte
blocks are used for the &lsquo;-c&rsquo; and
&lsquo;-f&rsquo; options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">umask [-p] [-S] [mode] <br>
The user file-creation mask is set to mode. If mode begins
with a digit, it is interpreted as an octal number;
otherwise it is interpreted as a symbolic mode mask similar
<br>
to that accepted by chmod(1). If mode is omitted, the
current value of the mask is printed. The -S option causes
the mask to be printed in symbolic form; the default <br>
output is an octal number. If the -p option is supplied, and
mode is omitted, the output is in a form that may be reused
as input. The return status is 0 if the mode was <br>
successfully changed or if no mode argument was supplied,
and false otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unalias [-a] [name ...] <br>
Remove each name from the list of defined aliases. If -a is
supplied, all alias definitions are removed. The return
value is true unless a supplied name is not a defined <br>
alias.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unset [-fv] [-n] [name ...] <br>
For each name, remove the corresponding variable or
function. If the -v option is given, each name refers to a
shell variable, and that variable is removed. Read-only <br>
variables may not be unset. If -f is specified, each name
refers to a shell function, and the function definition is
removed. If the -n option is supplied, and name is a <br>
variable with the nameref attribute, name will be unset
rather than the variable it references. -n has no effect if
the -f option is supplied. If no options are sup&acirc; <br>
plied, each name refers to a variable; if there is no
variable by that name, any function with that name is unset.
Each unset variable or function is removed from the <br>
environment passed to subsequent commands. If any of
COMP_WORDBREAKS, RANDOM, SECONDS, LINENO, HISTCMD, FUNCNAME,
GROUPS, or DIRSTACK are unset, they lose their special <br>
properties, even if they are subsequently reset. The exit
status is true unless a name is readonly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wait [-n] [n ...] <br>
Wait for each specified child process and return its
termination status. Each n may be a process ID or a job
specification; if a job spec is given, all processes in that
<br>
job&rsquo;s pipeline are waited for. If n is not given, all
currently active child processes are waited for, and the
return status is zero. If the -n option is supplied, wait
<br>
waits for any job to terminate and returns its exit status.
If n specifies a non-existent process or job, the return
status is 127. Otherwise, the return status is the <br>
exit status of the last process or job waited for.</p>
