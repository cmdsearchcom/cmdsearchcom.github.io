<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ltpmeter - LTP daemon task for aggregating and segmenting
transmission blocks</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ltpmeter remote_engine_nbr</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
ltpmeter is a background &quot;daemon&quot; task that
manages the presentation of LTP segments to link service
output tasks. Each &quot;span&quot; of LTP data interchange
between the local LTP <br>
engine and a neighboring LTP engine requires its own
ltpmeter task. All ltpmeter tasks are spawned automatically
by ltpadmin in response to the &rsquo;s&rsquo; command that
starts operation <br>
of the LTP protocol, and they are all terminated by ltpadmin
in response to an &rsquo;x&rsquo; (STOP) command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ltpmeter waits until its
span&rsquo;s current transmission block (the data to be
transmitted during the transmission session that is
currently being constructed) is ready for <br>
transmission, then divides the data in the span&rsquo;s
block buffer into segments and enqueues the segments for
transmission by the span&rsquo;s link service output task
(giving the <br>
segments semaphore to unblock the link service output task
as necessary), then reinitializes the span&rsquo;s block
buffer and starts another session (giving the &quot;buffer
empty&quot; <br>
semaphore to unblock the client service task -- nominally
ltpclo, the LTP convergence layer output task for Bundle
Protocol -- as necessary).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ltpmeter determines that the
current transmission block is ready for transmission by
waiting until either (a) the aggregate size of all service
data units in the block&rsquo;s buffer <br>
exceeds the aggregation size limit for this span or (b) the
length of time that the first service data unit in the
block&rsquo;s buffer has been awaiting transmission exceeds
the <br>
aggregation time limit for this span. The &quot;buffer
full&quot; semaphore is given when ION (either the
ltp_send() function or the ltpclock daemon) determines that
one of these <br>
conditions is true; ltpmeter simply waits for this semaphore
to be given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The initiation of a new session
may also be blocked: the total number of transmission
sessions that the local LTP engine may have open at a single
time is limited (this is LTP <br>
flow control), and while the engine is at this limit no new
sessions can be started. Availability of a session from the
session pool is signaled by the &quot;session&quot;
semaphore, <br>
which is given whenever a session is completed or
canceled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
&quot;0&quot; ltpmeter terminated normally, for reasons
noted in the ion.log file. If this termination was not
commanded, investigate and solve the problem identified in
the log file and <br>
use ltpadmin to restart ltpmeter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;1&quot; ltpmeter
terminated abnormally, for reasons noted in the ion.log
file. Investigate and solve the problem identified in the
log file, then use ltpadmin to restart ltpmeter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
No configuration files are needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
No environment variables apply.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
The following diagnostics may be issued to the ion.log log
file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ltpmeter can&rsquo;t initialize
LTP. <br>
ltpadmin has not yet initialized LTP protocol
operations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">No such engine in database. <br>
remote_engine_nbr is invalid, or the applicable span has not
yet been added to the LTP database by ltpadmin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ltpmeter task is already started
for this engine. <br>
Redundant initiation of ltpmeter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ltpmeter can&rsquo;t start new
session. <br>
An unrecoverable database error was encountered. ltpmeter
terminates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t take
bufClosedSemaphore. <br>
An unrecoverable database error was encountered. ltpmeter
terminates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t create extents list.
<br>
An unrecoverable database error was encountered. ltpmeter
terminates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t post
ExportSessionStart notice. <br>
An unrecoverable database error was encountered. ltpmeter
terminates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t finish session. <br>
An unrecoverable database error was encountered. ltpmeter
terminates.</p>
