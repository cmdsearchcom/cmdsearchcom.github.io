<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The ovsdb-client program is a command-line client for
interacting with a running ovsdb-server process. Each
command connects to an OVSDB server, which is
unix:/var/run/open&acirc; <br>
vswitch/db.sock by default, or may be specified as server in
one of the following forms:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ssl:ip:port <br>
The specified SSL port on the host at the given ip, which
must be expressed as an IP address (not a DNS name) in IPv4
or IPv6 address format. If ip is an IPv6 <br>
address, then wrap ip with square brackets, e.g.:
ssl:[::1]:6640. The --private-key, --certificate, and
--ca-cert options are mandatory when this form is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tcp:ip:port <br>
Connect to the given TCP port on ip, where ip can be IPv4 or
IPv6 address. If ip is an IPv6 address, then wrap ip with
square brackets, e.g.: tcp:[::1]:6640.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unix:file <br>
On POSIX, connect to the Unix domain server socket named
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On Windows, connect to a local
named pipe that is represented by a file created in the path
file to mimic the behavior of a Unix domain socket.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pssl:port[:ip] <br>
Listen on the given SSL port for a connection. By default,
connections are not bound to a particular local IP address
and it listens only on IPv4 (but not IPv6) <br>
addresses, but specifying ip limits connections to those
from the given ip, either IPv4 or IPv6 address. If ip is an
IPv6 address, then wrap ip with square brack&acirc; <br>
ets, e.g.: pssl:6640:[::1]. The --private-key,
--certificate, and --ca-cert options are mandatory when this
form is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ptcp:port[:ip] <br>
Listen on the given TCP port for a connection. By default,
connections are not bound to a particular local IP address
and it listens only on IPv4 (but not IPv6) <br>
addresses, but ip may be specified to listen only for
connections to the given ip, either IPv4 or IPv6 address. If
ip is an IPv6 address, then wrap ip with square <br>
brackets, e.g.: ptcp:6640:[::1].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">punix:file <br>
On POSIX, listen on the Unix domain server socket named file
for a connection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On Windows, listen on a local
named pipe. A file is created in the path file to mimic the
behavior of a Unix domain socket.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default database is
Open_vSwitch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Commands <br>
The following commands are implemented:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list-dbs [server] <br>
Connects to server, retrieves the list of known databases,
and prints them one per line. These database names are the
ones that may be used for database in the following <br>
commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">get-schema [server] [database]
<br>
Connects to server, retrieves the schema for database, and
prints it in JSON format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">get-schema-version [server]
[database] <br>
Connects to server, retrieves the schema for database, and
prints its version number on stdout. A schema version number
has the form x.y.z. See ovs-vswitchd.conf.db(5) <br>
for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Schema version numbers and Open
vSwitch version numbers are independent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If database was created before
schema versioning was introduced, then it will not have a
version number and this command will print a blank line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list-tables [server] [database]
<br>
Connects to server, retrieves the schema for database, and
prints a table listing the name of each table within the
database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list-columns [server] [database]
table <br>
Connects to server, retrieves the schema for database, and
prints a table listing the name and type of each column. If
table is specified, only columns in that table are <br>
listed; otherwise, the tables include columns in all
tables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">transact [server] transaction
<br>
Connects to server, sends it the specified transaction,
which must be a JSON array containing one or more valid
OVSDB operations, and prints the received reply on
stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dump [server] [database] [table
[column...]] <br>
Connects to server, retrieves all of the data in database,
and prints it on stdout as a series of tables. If table is
specified, only that table is retrieved. If at least <br>
one column is specified, only those columns are
retrieved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">monitor [server] [database]
table [column[,column]...]... <br>
monitor-cond [server] [database] conditions table
[column[,column]...]... <br>
Connects to server and monitors the contents of rows that
match conditions in table in database. By default, the
initial contents of table are printed, followed by each <br>
change as it occurs. If conditions empty, all rows will be
monitored. If at least one column is specified, only those
columns are monitored. The following column names <br>
have special meanings:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">!initial <br>
Do not print the initial contents of the specified
columns.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">!insert <br>
Do not print newly inserted rows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">!delete <br>
Do not print deleted rows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">!modify <br>
Do not print modifications to existing rows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Multiple [column[,column]...]
groups may be specified as separate arguments, e.g. to apply
different reporting parameters to each group. Whether
multiple groups or only a <br>
single group is specified, any given column may only be
mentioned once on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">conditions is a JSON array of
&lt;condition&gt; as defined in RFC 7047 5.1 with the
following change: A condition can be either a 3-element JSON
array as deescribed in the RFC <br>
or a boolean value..</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If --detach is used with monitor
or monitor-cond, then ovsdb-client detaches after it has
successfully received and printed the initial contents of
table.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The monitor command uses RFC
7047 &quot;monitor&quot; method to open a monitor session
with the server. The monitor-cond command uses RFC 7047
extension &quot;monitor_cond&quot; method. See <br>
ovsdb-server(1) for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">monitor [server] [database] ALL
<br>
Connects to server and monitors the contents of all tables
in database. Prints initial values and all kinds of changes
to all columns in the database. The --detach <br>
option causes ovsdb-client to detach after it successfully
receives and prints the initial database contents.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The monitor command uses RFC
7047 &quot;monitor&quot; method to open a monitor session
with the server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TESTING COMMANDS <br>
The following commands are mostly of interest for testing
the correctness of the OVSDB server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ovsdb-client [options] lock
[server] lock <br>
ovsdb-client [options] steal [server] lock <br>
ovsdb-client [options] unlock [server] lock <br>
Connects to server and issues corresponding RFC 7047 lock
operations on lock. Prints json reply or subsequent update
messages. The --detach option causes ovsdb-client to <br>
detach after it successfully receives and prints the initial
reply.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When running with the --detach
option, lock, steal, unlock and exit commands can be issued
by using ovs-appctl. exit command causes the ovsdb-client to
close its <br>
ovsdb-server connection before exit. The lock, steal and
unlock commands can be used to issue additional lock
operations over the same ovsdb-server connection. All above
<br>
commands take a single lock argument, which does not have to
be the same as the lock that ovsdb-client started with.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Output Formatting Options <br>
Much of the output from ovsdb-client is in the form of
tables. The following options controlling output
formatting:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f format <br>
--format=format <br>
Sets the type of table formatting. The following types of
format are available:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">table (default) <br>
2-D text tables with aligned columns.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list A list with one column per
line and rows separated by a blank line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">html HTML tables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">csv Comma-separated values as
defined in RFC 4180.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">json JSON format as defined in
RFC 4627. The output is a sequence of JSON objects, each of
which corresponds to one table. Each JSON object has the
following members <br>
with the noted values:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">caption <br>
The table&rsquo;s caption. This member is omitted if the
table has no caption.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">headings <br>
An array with one element per table column. Each array
element is a string giving the corresponding column&rsquo;s
heading.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">data An array with one element
per table row. Each element is also an array with one
element per table column. The elements of this second-level
array are the <br>
cells that constitute the table. Cells that represent OVSDB
data or data types are expressed in the format described in
the OVSDB specification; other cells <br>
are simply expressed as text strings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d format <br>
--data=format <br>
Sets the formatting for cells within output tables. The
following types of format are available:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">string (default) <br>
The simple format described in the Database Values section
of ovs-vsctl(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bare The simple format with
punctuation stripped off: [] and {} are omitted around sets,
maps, and empty columns, items within sets and maps are
space-separated, and <br>
strings are never quoted. This format may be easier for
scripts to parse.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">json JSON.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The json output format always
outputs cells in JSON format, ignoring this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-heading <br>
This option suppresses the heading row that otherwise
appears in the first row of table output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--pretty <br>
By default, JSON in output is printed as compactly as
possible. This option causes JSON in output to be printed in
a more readable fashion. Members of objects and ele&acirc;
<br>
ments of arrays are printed one per line, with
indentation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option does not affect JSON
in tables, which is always printed compactly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--bare Equivalent to
--format=list --data=bare --no-headings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--timestamp <br>
For the monitor and monitor-cond commands, add a timestamp
to each table update. Most output formats add the timestamp
on a line of its own just above the table. The <br>
JSON output format puts the timestamp in a member of the
top-level JSON object named time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Daemon Options <br>
The daemon options apply only to the monitor and
monitor-cond commands. With any other command, they have no
effect. The following options are valid on POSIX based
platforms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--pidfile[=pidfile] <br>
Causes a file (by default, ovsdb-client.pid) to be created
indicating the PID of the running process. If the pidfile
argument is not specified, or if it does not begin <br>
with /, then it is created in /var/run/openvswitch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If --pidfile is not specified,
no pidfile is created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--overwrite-pidfile <br>
By default, when --pidfile is specified and the specified
pidfile already exists and is locked by a running process,
ovsdb-client refuses to start. Specify --over&acirc; <br>
write-pidfile to cause it to instead overwrite the
pidfile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When --pidfile is not specified,
this option has no effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--detach <br>
Runs ovsdb-client as a background process. The process
forks, and in the child it starts a new session, closes the
standard file descriptors (which has the side effect of <br>
disabling logging to the console), and changes its current
directory to the root (unless --no-chdir is specified).
After the child completes its initialization, the par&acirc;
<br>
ent exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--monitor <br>
Creates an additional process to monitor the ovsdb-client
daemon. If the daemon dies due to a signal that indicates a
programming error (SIGABRT, SIGALRM, SIGBUS, SIGFPE, <br>
SIGILL, SIGPIPE, SIGSEGV, SIGXCPU, or SIGXFSZ) then the
monitor process starts a new copy of it. If the daemon dies
or exits for another reason, the monitor process <br>
exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is normally used
with --detach, but it also functions without it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-chdir <br>
By default, when --detach is specified, ovsdb-client changes
its current working directory to the root directory after it
detaches. Otherwise, invoking ovsdb-client from <br>
a carelessly chosen directory would prevent the
administrator from unmounting the file system that holds
that directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specifying --no-chdir suppresses
this behavior, preventing ovsdb-client from changing its
current working directory. This may be useful for collecting
core files, since <br>
it is common behavior to write core dumps into the current
working directory and the root directory is not a good
directory to use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option has no effect when
--detach is not specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-self-confinement <br>
By default daemon will try to self-confine itself to work
with files under well-know, at build-time whitelisted
directories. It is better to stick with this default <br>
behavior and not to use this flag unless some other Access
Control is used to confine daemon. Note that in contrast to
other access control implementations that are typi&acirc;
<br>
cally enforced from kernel-space (e.g. DAC or MAC),
self-confinement is imposed from the user-space daemon
itself and hence should not be considered as a full
confinement <br>
strategy, but instead should be viewed as an additional
layer of security.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--user Causes ovsdb-client to
run as a different user specified in &quot;user:group&quot;,
thus dropping most of the root privileges. Short forms
&quot;user&quot; and &quot;:group&quot; are also allowed,
with <br>
current user or group are assumed respectively. Only daemons
started by the root user accepts this argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On Linux, daemons will be
granted CAP_IPC_LOCK and CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICES before
dropping root privileges. Daemons that interact with a
datapath, such as ovs-vswitchd, will <br>
be granted two additional capabilities, namely CAP_NET_ADMIN
and CAP_NET_RAW. The capability change will apply even if
new user is &quot;root&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On Windows, this option is not
currently supported. For security reasons, specifying this
option will cause the daemon process not to start.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Logging Options <br>
-v[spec] <br>
--verbose=[spec] <br>
Sets logging levels. Without any spec, sets the log level
for every module and destination to dbg. Otherwise, spec is
a list of words separated by spaces or commas or <br>
colons, up to one from each category below:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A valid module
name, as displayed by the vlog/list command on
ovs-appctl(8), limits the log level change to the specified
module.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; syslog, console,
or file, to limit the log level change to only to the system
log, to the console, or to a file, respectively. (If
--detach is specified, <br>
ovsdb-client closes its standard file descriptors, so
logging to the console will have no effect.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On Windows platform, syslog is
accepted as a word and is only useful along with the
--syslog-target option (the word has no effect
otherwise).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; off, emer, err,
warn, info, or dbg, to control the log level. Messages of
the given severity or higher will be logged, and messages of
lower severity will be fil&acirc; <br>
tered out. off filters out all messages. See ovs-appctl(8)
for a definition of each log level.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Case is not significant within
spec.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Regardless of the log levels set
for file, logging to a file will not take place unless
--log-file is also specified (see below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For compatibility with older
versions of OVS, any is accepted as a word but has no
effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v <br>
--verbose <br>
Sets the maximum logging verbosity level, equivalent to
--verbose=dbg.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-vPATTERN:destination:pattern
<br>
--verbose=PATTERN:destination:pattern <br>
Sets the log pattern for destination to pattern. Refer to
ovs-appctl(8) for a description of the valid syntax for
pattern.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-vFACILITY:facility <br>
--verbose=FACILITY:facility <br>
Sets the RFC5424 facility of the log message. facility can
be one of kern, user, mail, daemon, auth, syslog, lpr, news,
uucp, clock, ftp, ntp, audit, alert, clock2, <br>
local0, local1, local2, local3, local4, local5, local6 or
local7. If this option is not specified, daemon is used as
the default for the local system syslog and local0 is <br>
used while sending a message to the target provided via the
--syslog-target option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--log-file[=file] <br>
Enables logging to a file. If file is specified, then it is
used as the exact name for the log file. The default log
file name used if file is omitted is /var/log/open&acirc;
<br>
vswitch/ovsdb-client.log.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--syslog-target=host:port <br>
Send syslog messages to UDP port on host, in addition to the
system syslog. The host must be a numerical IP address, not
a hostname.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--syslog-method=method <br>
Specify method how syslog messages should be sent to syslog
daemon. Following forms are supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; libc, use libc
syslog() function. This is the default behavior. Downside of
using this options is that libc adds fixed prefix to every
message before it is actu&acirc; <br>
ally sent to the syslog daemon over /dev/log UNIX domain
socket.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; unix:file, use
UNIX domain socket directly. It is possible to specify
arbitrary message format with this option. However, rsyslogd
8.9 and older versions use hard <br>
coded parser function anyway that limits UNIX domain socket
use. If you want to use arbitrary message format with older
rsyslogd versions, then use UDP socket to <br>
localhost IP address instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; udp:ip:port, use
UDP socket. With this method it is possible to use arbitrary
message format also with older rsyslogd. When sending syslog
messages over UDP <br>
socket extra precaution needs to be taken into account, for
example, syslog daemon needs to be configured to listen on
the specified UDP port, accidental iptables <br>
rules could be interfering with local syslog traffic and
there are some security considerations that apply to UDP
sockets, but do not apply to UNIX domain sockets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Public Key Infrastructure
Options <br>
-p privkey.pem <br>
--private-key=privkey.pem <br>
Specifies a PEM file containing the private key used as
ovsdb-client&rsquo;s identity for outgoing SSL
connections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c cert.pem <br>
--certificate=cert.pem <br>
Specifies a PEM file containing a certificate that certifies
the private key specified on -p or --private-key to be
trustworthy. The certificate must be signed by the <br>
certificate authority (CA) that the peer in SSL connections
will use to verify it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C cacert.pem <br>
--ca-cert=cacert.pem <br>
Specifies a PEM file containing the CA certificate that
ovsdb-client should use to verify certificates presented to
it by SSL peers. (This may be the same certificate <br>
that SSL peers use to verify the certificate specified on -c
or --certificate, or it may be a different one, depending on
the PKI design in use.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C none <br>
--ca-cert=none <br>
Disables verification of certificates presented by SSL
peers. This introduces a security risk, because it means
that certificates cannot be verified to be those of known
<br>
trusted hosts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--bootstrap-ca-cert=cacert.pem
<br>
When cacert.pem exists, this option has the same effect as
-C or --ca-cert. If it does not exist, then ovsdb-client
will attempt to obtain the CA certificate from the SSL <br>
peer on its first SSL connection and save it to the named
PEM file. If it is successful, it will immediately drop the
connection and reconnect, and from then on all SSL <br>
connections must be authenticated by a certificate signed by
the CA certificate thus obtained.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option exposes the SSL
connection to a man-in-the-middle attack obtaining the
initial CA certificate, but it may be useful for
bootstrapping.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is only useful if
the SSL peer sends its CA certificate as part of the SSL
certificate chain. The SSL protocol does not require the
server to send the CA cer&acirc; <br>
tificate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is mutually
exclusive with -C and --ca-cert.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SSL Connection Options <br>
--ssl-protocols=protocols <br>
Specifies, in a comma- or space-delimited list, the SSL
protocols ovsdb-client will enable for SSL connections.
Supported protocols include TLSv1, TLSv1.1, and TLSv1.2.
<br>
Regardless of order, the highest protocol supported by both
sides will be chosen when making the connection. The default
when this option is omitted is <br>
TLSv1,TLSv1.1,TLSv1.2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ssl-ciphers=ciphers <br>
Specifies, in OpenSSL cipher string format, the ciphers
ovsdb-client will support for SSL connections. The default
when this option is omitted is HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other Options <br>
-h <br>
--help Prints a brief help message to the console.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V <br>
