<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
Helping new RRDtool users to understand the basics of
RRDtool</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This manual is an attempt to assist beginners in
understanding the concepts of RRDtool. It sheds a light on
differences between RRDtool and other databases. With help
of an <br>
example, it explains the structure of RRDtool database. This
is followed by an overview of the &quot;graph&quot; feature
of RRDtool. At the end, it has sample scripts that
illustrate the <br>
usage/wrapping of RRDtool within Shell or Perl scripts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">What makes RRDtool so special?
<br>
RRDtool is GNU licensed software developed by Tobias
Oetiker, a system manager at the Swiss Federal Institute of
Technology. Though it is a database, there are distinct <br>
differences between RRDtool databases and other databases as
listed below:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; RRDtool stores
data; that makes it a back-end tool. The RRDtool command set
allows the creation of graphs; that makes it a front-end
tool as well. Other databases just store <br>
data and can not create graphs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; In case of
linear databases, new data gets appended at the bottom of
the database table. Thus its size keeps on increasing,
whereas the size of an RRDtool database is <br>
determined at creation time. Imagine an RRDtool database as
the perimeter of a circle. Data is added along the
perimeter. When new data reaches the starting point, it <br>
overwrites existing data. This way, the size of an RRDtool
database always remains constant. The name &quot;Round
Robin&quot; stems from this behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Other databases
store the values as supplied. RRDtool can be configured to
calculate the rate of change from the previous to the
current value and store this information <br>
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Other databases
get updated when values are supplied. The RRDtool database
is structured in such a way that it needs data at predefined
time intervals. If it does not get a <br>
new value during the interval, it stores an UNKNOWN value
for that interval. So, when using the RRDtool database, it
is imperative to use scripts that run at regular <br>
intervals to ensure a constant data flow to update the
RRDtool database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RRDtool is designed to store
time series of data. With every data update, an associated
time stamp is stored. Time is always expressed in seconds
passed since epoch (01-01-1970). <br>
RRDtool can be installed on Unix as well as Windows. It
comes with a command set to carry out various operations on
RRD databases. This command set can be accessed from the
<br>
command line, as well as from Shell or Perl scripts. The
scripts act as wrappers for accessing data stored in RRDtool
databases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Understanding by an example <br>
The structure of an RRD database is different than other
linear databases. Other databases define tables with
columns, and many other parameters. These definitions
sometimes are <br>
very complex, especially in large databases. RRDtool
databases are primarily used for monitoring purposes and
hence are very simple in structure. The parameters that need
to be <br>
defined are variables that hold values and archives of those
values. Being time sensitive, a couple of time related
parameters are also defined. Because of its structure, the
<br>
definition of an RRDtool database also includes a provision
to specify specific actions to take in the absence of update
values. Data Source (DS), heartbeat, Date Source Type <br>
(DST), Round Robin Archive (RRA), and Consolidation Function
(CF) are some of the terminologies related to RRDtool
databases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The structure of a database and
the terminology associated with it can be best explained
with an example.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rrdtool create target.rrd
--start 1023654125 --step 300 DS:mem:GAUGE:600:0:671744
RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:12:24 RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:288:31</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This example creates a database
named target.rrd. Start time
(1&rsquo;023&rsquo;654&rsquo;125) is specified in total
number of seconds since epoch (time in seconds since
01-01-1970). While <br>
updating the database, the update time is also specified.
This update time MUST be large (later) then start time and
MUST be in seconds since epoch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The step of 300 seconds
indicates that database expects new values every 300
seconds. The wrapper script should be scheduled to run every
step seconds so that it updates the <br>
database every step seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DS (Data Source) is the actual
variable which relates to the parameter on the device that
is monitored. Its syntax is</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">DS:variable_name:DST:heartbeat:min:max</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DS is a key word.
&quot;variable_name&quot; is a name under which the
parameter is saved in the database. There can be as many DSs
in a database as needed. After every step interval, a new
<br>
value of DS is supplied to update the database. This value
is also called Primary Data Point (PDP). In our example
mentioned above, a new PDP is generated every 300
seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note, that if you do NOT supply
new data points exactly every 300 seconds, this is not a
problem, RRDtool will interpolate the data accordingly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DST (Data Source Type) defines
the type of the DS. It can be COUNTER, DERIVE, ABSOLUTE,
GAUGE. A DS declared as COUNTER will save the rate of change
of the value over a step <br>
period. This assumes that the value is always increasing
(the difference between the current and the previous value
is greater than 0). Traffic counters on a router are an
ideal <br>
candidate for using COUNTER as DST. DERIVE is the same as
COUNTER, but it allows negative values as well. If you want
to see the rate of change in free disk space on your server,
<br>
then you might want to use the DERIVE data type. ABSOLUTE
also saves the rate of change, but it assumes that the
previous value is set to 0. The difference between the
current <br>
and the previous value is always equal to the current value.
Thus it just stores the current value divided by the step
interval (300 seconds in our example). GAUGE does not save
<br>
the rate of change. It saves the actual value itself. There
are no divisions or calculations. Memory consumption in a
server is a typical example of gauge. The difference between
<br>
the different types DSTs can be explained better with the
following example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Values = 300, 600, 900, 1200
<br>
Step = 300 seconds <br>
COUNTER DS = 1, 1, 1, 1 <br>
DERIVE DS = 1, 1, 1, 1 <br>
ABSOLUTE DS = 1, 2, 3, 4 <br>
GAUGE DS = 300, 600, 900, 1200</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The next parameter is heartbeat.
In our example, heartbeat is 600 seconds. If the database
does not get a new PDP within 300 seconds, it will wait for
another 300 seconds (total <br>
600 seconds). If it doesn&rsquo;t receive any PDP within 600
seconds, it will save an UNKNOWN value into the database.
This UNKNOWN value is a special feature of RRDtool - it is
much <br>
better than to assume a missing value was 0 (zero) or any
other number which might also be a valid data value. For
example, the traffic flow counter on a router keeps <br>
increasing. Lets say, a value is missed for an interval and
0 is stored instead of UNKNOWN. Now when the next value
becomes available, it will calculate the difference between
<br>
the current value and the previous value (0) which is not
correct. So, inserting the value UNKNOWN makes much more
sense here.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The next two parameters are the
minimum and maximum value, respectively. If the variable to
be stored has predictable maximum and minimum values, this
should be specified here. <br>
Any update value falling out of this range will be stored as
UNKNOWN.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The next line declares a round
robin archive (RRA). The syntax for declaring an RRA is</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RRA:CF:xff:step:rows</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RRA is the keyword to declare
RRAs. The consolidation function (CF) can be AVERAGE,
MINIMUM, MAXIMUM, and LAST. The concept of the consolidated
data point (CDP) comes into the <br>
picture here. A CDP is CFed (averaged, maximum/minimum value
or last value) from step number of PDPs. This RRA will hold
rows CDPs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Lets have a look at the example
above. For the first RRA, 12 (steps) PDPs (DS variables) are
AVERAGEed (CF) to form one CDP. 24 (rows) of theses CDPs are
archived. Each PDP <br>
occurs at 300 seconds. 12 PDPs represent 12 times 300
seconds which is 1 hour. It means 1 CDP (which is equal to
12 PDPs) represents data worth 1 hour. 24 such CDPs
represent 1 <br>
day (1 hour times 24 CDPs). This means, this RRA is an
archive for one day. After 24 CDPs, CDP number 25 will
replace the 1st CDP. The second RRA saves 31 CDPs; each CPD
<br>
represents an AVERAGE value for a day (288 PDPs, each
covering 300 seconds = 24 hours). Therefore this RRA is an
archive for one month. A single database can have many RRAs.
If <br>
there are multiple DSs, each individual RRA will save data
for all the DSs in the database. For example, if a database
has 3 DSs and daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly RRAs are
<br>
declared, then each RRA will hold data from all 3 data
sources.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Graphical Magic <br>
Another important feature of RRDtool is its ability to
create graphs. The &quot;graph&quot; command uses the
&quot;fetch&quot; command internally to retrieve values from
the database. With the <br>
retrieved values it draws graphs as defined by the
parameters supplied on the command line. A single graph can
show different DS (Data Sources) from a database. It is also
<br>
possible to show the values from more than one database in a
single graph. Often, it is necessary to perform some math on
the values retrieved from the database before plotting <br>
them. For example, in SNMP replies, memory consumption
values are usually specified in KBytes and traffic flow on
interfaces is specified in Bytes. Graphs for these values
will <br>
be more meaningful if values are represented in MBytes and
mbps. The RRDtool graph command allows to define such
conversions. Apart from mathematical calculations, it is
also <br>
possible to perform logical operations such as greater than,
less than, and if/then/else. If a database contains more
than one RRA archive, then a question may arise - how does
<br>
RRDtool decide which RRA archive to use for retrieving the
values? RRDtool looks at several things when making its
choice. First it makes sure that the RRA covers as much of
the <br>
graphing time frame as possible. Second it looks at the
resolution of the RRA compared to the resolution of the
graph. It tries to find one which has the same or higher
better <br>
resolution. With the &quot;-r&quot; option you can force
RRDtool to assume a different resolution than the one
calculated from the pixel width of the graph.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Values of different variables
can be presented in 5 different shapes in a graph - AREA,
LINE1, LINE2, LINE3, and STACK. AREA is represented by a
solid colored area with values as <br>
the boundary of this area. LINE1/2/3 (increasing width) are
just plain lines representing the values. STACK is also an
area but it is &quot;stack&quot;ed on top AREA or LINE1/2/3.
Another <br>
important thing to note is that variables are plotted in the
order they are defined in the graph command. Therefore care
must be taken to define STACK only after defining <br>
AREA/LINE. It is also possible to put formatted comments
within the graph. Detailed instructions can be found in the
graph manual.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Wrapping RRDtool within
Shell/Perl script <br>
After understanding RRDtool it is now a time to actually use
RRDtool in scripts. Tasks involved in network management are
data collection, data storage, and data retrieval. In <br>
the following example, the previously created target.rrd
database is used. Data collection and data storage is done
using Shell scripts. Data retrieval and report generation is
<br>
done using Perl scripts. These scripts are shown below:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Shell script (collects data,
updates database)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#!/bin/sh <br>
a=0 <br>
while [ &quot;$a&quot; == 0 ]; do <br>
snmpwalk -c public 192.168.1.250 hrSWRunPerfMem &gt;
snmp_reply <br>
total_mem=&lsquo;awk &rsquo;BEGIN {tot_mem=0} <br>
{ if ($NF == &quot;KBytes&quot;) <br>
{tot_mem=tot_mem+$(NF-1)} <br>
} <br>
END {print tot_mem}&rsquo; snmp_reply&lsquo; <br>
# I can use N as a replacement for the current time <br>
rrdtool update target.rrd N:$total_mem <br>
# sleep until the next 300 seconds are full <br>
perl -e &rsquo;sleep 300 - time % 300&rsquo; <br>
done # end of while loop</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl script (retrieves data from
database and generates graphs and statistics)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#!/usr/bin/perl -w <br>
