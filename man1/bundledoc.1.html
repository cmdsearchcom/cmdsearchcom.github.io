<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
bundledoc - bundle all the files needed by a LaTeX
document</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
bundledoc [--version] [--help] [--[no]verbose]
[--texfile=file] [--directory=directory] [--[no]localonly]
[--exclude=string] [--include=filespec] [--manifest=file]
<br>
[--listdeps=[yes|no|only|rel]...] [--[no]keepdirs]
[--config=file] .dep file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
bundledoc is a post-processor for the snapshot package that
bundles together all the classes, packages, and files needed
to build a given LaTeX document. It reads the .dep file <br>
that snapshot produces, finds each of the files mentioned
therein, and packages them into a single archive file (e.g.,
a .tar.gz file), suitable for moving across systems, <br>
transmitting to a colleague, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As the simplest example
possible, consider a LaTeX file called, say, hello.tex:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Needed by bundledoc <br>
ocumentclass[11pt]{article} g i n { d</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nt} o c u m <br>
Hello, world! <br>
\nd{document}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;auses a hello.dep file
to be produced. When bundledoc is then given
&quot;hello.dep&quot; as an argument, it locates the
dependent files -- snapshot.sty, <br>
article.cls, and size11.clo -- and bundles them into a
single archive file, along with hello.tex and a MANIFEST
file (described in &quot;OPTIONS&quot;, below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
In the following descriptions, somefile refers to the name
of your main LaTeX document (no extension).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bundledoc requires the name of
the dependency file produced by snapshot (normally
somefile.dep). The following options may also be given:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Output the bundledoc script&rsquo;s version number. This
overrides all of the remaining options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help <br>
Give a brief usage message. This overrides all of the
remaining options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--[no]verbose (default:
&quot;noverbose&quot;) <br>
bundledoc normally does not output anything except error
messages. With &quot;--verbose&quot;, it outputs copious
status messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--texfile=main .tex file
(default: somefile.tex) <br>
snapshot&rsquo;s dependency file does not list the main
LaTeX file (the one that gets passed to latex). In order for
bundledoc to find and bundle that file, bundledoc assumes it
<br>
has the same name as the snapshot dependency file but with a
.tex extension. If this is not the case, then use
&quot;--texfile&quot; to specify the correct filename.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--directory=archive directory
(default: somefile) <br>
When bundledoc creates an archive (e.g., a .tar or .zip
file) containing the document&rsquo;s files, it puts all of
them in a directory to avoid cluttering the current
directory <br>
with files. If the given dependency file is called
somefile.dep then the resulting archive will, by default,
store all the dependent files in a somefile directory. To
<br>
change the directory name use the &quot;--directory&quot;
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--[no]localonly (default:
&quot;nolocalonly&quot;) <br>
Although bundledoc normally archives all of the files named
in the .dep file, the &quot;--localonly&quot; option tells
bundledoc to exclude all files located in a directory other
than <br>
the .tex file&rsquo;s directory or one of its
subdirectories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--exclude=string (default: none)
<br>
While &quot;--localonly&quot; causes files outside of the
.tex file&rsquo;s directory tree to be omitted from the
archive, &quot;--exclude&quot; provides finer-grained
control over files to omit from <br>
the archive. The &quot;--exclude&quot; option, which can be
specified repeatedly on the command line, causes all files
whose name contains string to be omitted from the
archive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--include=filespec (default:
none) <br>
The &quot;--include&quot; option, which can be specified
repeatedly on the command line, instructs bundledoc to
include in the archive all of the files matching filespec,
even if <br>
they&rsquo;re not referenced in the .dep file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--manifest=manifest file
(default: MANIFEST) <br>
In addition to the dependent files, bundledoc includes in
the archive file one extra file called, by default,
&lsquo;&lsquo;MANIFEST&rsquo;&rsquo;. MANIFEST is a text
file that lists the original <br>
filenames of all the dependencies. To change the filename
from &lsquo;&lsquo;MANIFEST&rsquo;&rsquo; to something else,
use the &quot;--manifest&quot; option. As a special case,
&quot;--manifest=&quot;&quot;&quot; tells <br>
bundledoc not to include a manifest file at all.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--listdeps=[yes|no|only|rel]...]
(default: &quot;no&quot;) <br>
&quot;--listdeps&quot; accepts one or more of
&quot;yes&quot;, &quot;no&quot;, &quot;only&quot;, or
&quot;rel&quot; as a comma-separated list. As long as
&quot;no&quot; does not appear in this list, bundledoc
outputs all of the main <br>
LaTeX file&rsquo;s dependencies. If the list contains
&quot;rel&quot;, then bundledoc outputs the list of
dependencies with relative pathnames. If the list contains
&quot;only&quot;, then bundledoc <br>
exits after displaying the list, without producing an
archive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--[no]keepdirs (default:
&quot;nokeepdirs&quot;) <br>
Normally, the archive file that bundledoc produces contains
a single directory -- and subdirectories, if the document
refers explicitly to them -- in which all the dependent <br>
files lie. If &quot;--keepdirs&quot; is specified, all the
dependent files are stored with their original pathnames.
For example, if somefile.tex depends on
figures/somefigure.eps, <br>
article.cls, and snapshot.sty, then the somefile archive
will normally contain the following files:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
somefile/somefile.tex</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
somefile/figures/somefigure.eps</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
somefile/article.cls</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
somefile/snapshot.sty</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
somefile/MANIFEST</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, &quot;--keepdirs&quot;
will cause the somefile archive to contain the following
sorts of filenames instead:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
home/me/mydocs/somefile.tex</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
home/me/mydocs/figures/somefigure.eps</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
usr/share/texmf/tex/latex/base/article.cls</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
usr/share/texmf/tex/latex/snapshot/snapshot.sty</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;--directory&quot; is not
used when &quot;--keepdirs&quot; is in effect. In addition,
no manifest file is written to the archive file as it
contains redundant information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--config=configuration file
(default: &lt;none&gt;) <br>
The &quot;--config&quot; option is used to point bundledoc
to the appropriate configuration (.cfg) file for your TeX
distribution and operating system. bundledoc comes with a
few <br>
configuration files and it&rsquo;s easy to write more. See
&quot;CONFIGURATION FILES&quot; (below) for a description of
the configuration file format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION FILES <br>
Format <br>
Configuration files follow a fairly simple format. Lines
beginning with &quot;#&quot; are comments. Blank lines are
ignored. All other lines are of the form:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">variable: value</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The current version of bundledoc
recognizes the following variables:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bundle <br>
The command to use to bundle a set of files into a single
archive file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sink <br>
The affix to a command to discard its output</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">find <br>
The command to find a file within the TeX tree(s).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Values that are too long for one
line can be split across multiple lines by using &quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are two environment
variables that bundledoc makes available for use by
configuration-file commands: &quot;BDBASE&quot;, which is
set to somefile (as in &quot;OPTIONS&quot;), and
&quot;BDINPUTS&quot;, <br>
which is set to a space-separated list of files that a
command is to operate upon. That is, when the command
associated with &quot;bundle&quot; is running,
&quot;BDINPUTS&quot; contains the list of <br>
all the files that are to be archived. In contrast, when the
command associated with &quot;find&quot; is running,
&quot;BDINPUTS&quot; contains the name of the file to search
for.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples <br>
The following configuration file parallels bundledoc&rsquo;s
default values of the various configuration-file variables,
which represents a kpathsea-based TeX distribution running
on a <br>
generic Unix system, which doesn&rsquo;t necessarily have
any of the GNU tools, such as gzip or GNU tar:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># &quot;Default&quot;
configuration file <br>
# By Scott Pakin &lt;scott+bdoc@pakin.org&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bundle: (tar -cvf - $BDINPUTS |
compress &gt; $BDBASE.tar.Z) <br>
sink: &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 <br>
find: kpsewhich -progname=latex $BDINPUTS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The parentheses in the
&quot;bundle:&quot; line tell the Unix shell to run the
command in a subshell. This is to make the &quot;sink:&quot;
affix work properly (i.e., so there aren&rsquo;t two
&quot;&gt;&quot;&rsquo;s in <br>
the same command).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Notice how the commands treat
&quot;BDBASE&quot; and &quot;BDINPUTS&quot; like any other
environment variables in a Unix shell, using &quot;$&quot;
to take their value. Other operating systems use different
<br>
conventions for referring to environment variables. For
instance, a configuration file for a Windows-based TeX
distribution would use &quot;%BDBASE%&quot; and
&quot;%BDINPUTS%&quot; instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The value for &quot;sink:&quot;
is specific to an operating system. The value for
&quot;find:&quot; is specific to a TeX distribution.
&quot;bundle:&quot; is where the most opportunity for
customization <br>
lies. You can use &quot;bundle:&quot; to specify your
favorite archive format. For example, you can produce a shar
file on Unix with something like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bundle: (shar
--archive-name=&quot;$BDBASE&quot; $BDINPUTS &gt;
$BDBASE.sh)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or a CAB file on Microsoft
Windows with something like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bundle: cabarc -r -p N
%BDBASE%.cab %BDINPUTS%</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Assume that myfile.dep was produced from myfile.tex by
following the instructions in the Description section. The
following command produces a .zip file with the MikTeX TeX
<br>
distribution running on Microsoft Windows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bundledoc --config=miktex.cfg
myfile.dep</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(In practice, it&rsquo;s
probably necessary to specify to &quot;--config&quot; the
complete path to bundledoc&rsquo;s miktex.cfg configuration
file.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following builds a .tar.gz
archive with the TeX Live distribution running on a
Unix-like operating system. bundledoc will produce verbose
output describing its operations. <br>
All files not in the same directory tree as myfile.tex and
all files containing &quot;.fd&quot; or &quot;.sty&quot; in
their names are omitted. However, all .bib files in the
current directory will <br>
be included in the archive even though none of them are
referenced by myfile.dep. Finally, no MANIFEST file will be
produced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bundledoc
--config=texlive-unix.cfg --verbose --localonly
--exclude=.fd --exclude=.cfg --include=&quot;*.bib&quot;
--manifest=&quot;&quot; myfile.dep</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
The user must have previously installed snapshot.sty and
used it to produce a dependency file for his document.
Besides that, the set of external files needed by bundledoc
is <br>
system-specific and depends on the configuration file used.
(See &quot;CONFIGURATION FILES&quot;, above.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bundledoc currently comes with
two configuration files:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">texlive-unix.cfg <br>
Configuration file for TeX Live installations on Unix or
Linux. TeX Live is a kpathsea-based TeX distribution that
runs on various flavors of Unix and Microsoft Windows. <br>
texlive-unix.cfg assumes you have gzip and uses it to
produce a .tar.gz archive file. The configuration file has
bundledoc use kpsewhich to find LaTeX files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">miktex.cfg <br>
Configuration file for MikTeX installations. MikTeX is a
popular TeX distribution for Microsoft Windows. miktex.cfg
assumes you have zip and uses it to produce a .zip <br>
archive file. The configuration file now has bundledoc use
kpsewhich to find LaTeX files; older version of MikTeX
required the rather nonstandard initexmf for this
purpose.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">texlive-unix-arlatex.cfg <br>
This is a variant of texlive-unix.cfg that uses arlatex
instead of gzip to archive files. arlatex is a script
included in the bundledoc distribution that generates a
self- <br>
extracting .tex file based on LaTeX&rsquo;s
&quot;filecontents&quot; environment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
Including and excluding files <br>
The &quot;--localonly&quot;, &quot;--exclude&quot;, and
&quot;--include&quot; options provide control over the
archive&rsquo;s contents. &quot;--exclude&quot; and
&quot;--include&quot; can be specified repeatedly on the
command line. <br>
The order in which these options are specified is
immaterial; bundledoc processes file inclusions and
exclusions in the following order:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. All files referenced by the
.dep file are added to the list of files to archive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. If &quot;--localonly&quot; is
specified, all files not found in the .tex file&rsquo;s
directory are removed from the list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. For each
&quot;--exclude&quot; string specified, all files containing
that string are removed from the list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. For each
&quot;--include&quot; file specification, the set of files
designated by its expansion are added to the list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Issues When Running Under
Microsoft Windows <br>
First, because bundledoc is a Perl script, you should do one
of the following to run it under Windows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &quot;perl
bundledoc&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Rename bundledoc
to bundledoc.pl and run &quot;bundledoc.pl&quot;. (This is
assuming you have a file association set up for .pl.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Run the pl2bat
script (if you have it) to convert bundledoc to
bundledoc.bat, then run &quot;bundledoc&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Second, Windows uses a
multi-rooted filesystem (i.e., multiple drive letters). I
wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if bad things were to happen if
the files to be bundled are scattered <br>
across drives. In addition, Windows supports
&lsquo;&lsquo;UNC&rsquo;&rsquo; filenames, which have no
drive letter at all, just a machine and share name. UNC
filenames are also untested waters for <br>
bundledoc. Be careful!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Testing Status <br>
I have tested bundledoc only with Perl v5.6.0 and later and
only on the following platforms:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Linux + TeX
Live</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Linux +
teTeX</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Windows NT +
MiKTeX</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Solaris + ???
(something kpathsea-based)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is my hope that bundledoc
works on many more platforms than those. I tried to make the
program itself fairly independent of the operating system;
only the configuration files <br>
should have to change to run bundledoc on a different
system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Future Work <br>
I&rsquo;d like bundledoc to work on as wide a variety of TeX
distributions as possible. If your platform is significantly
different from the ones listed in &quot;Testing Status&quot;
(e.g., if <br>
you&rsquo;re running ) and you need to create a
substantially different configuration file from
texlive-unix.cfg and miktex.cfg, please send it to me at the
address listed in &quot;AUTHOR&quot; <br>
so I can include it in a future version of bundledoc. (I
make no promises, though).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once bundledoc works on all the
major operating systems and TeX distributions it would be
really convenient if I could get bundledoc to detect the
platform it&rsquo;s running on and <br>
automatically select an appropriate configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, it would be handy for
bundledoc to include fonts in the archive file. At a
minimum, it should include .tfm files, but it would be even
better if it included .mf, .pfb, <br>
.ttf, and other common font formats, as well.</p>

the &quot;--localonly&quot; option and for a discussion that

options; and to Marius <br>

subdirectories.</p>
