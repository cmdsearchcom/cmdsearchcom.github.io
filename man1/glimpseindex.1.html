glimpseindex - index whole file systems to be searched by glimpse
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OVERVIEW"><a class="selflink" href="#OVERVIEW">OVERVIEW</a></h1>
<i>Glimpse</i> (which stands for GLobal IMPlicit SEarch) is a popular UNIX
  indexing and query system that allows you to search through a large set of
  files very quickly. Glimpseindex is the indexing program for glimpse. Glimpse
  supports most of <i>agrep</i>'s options ( <i>agrep</i> is our powerful version
  of <i>grep</i>) including approximate matching (e.g., finding misspelled
  words), Boolean queries, and even some limited forms of regular expressions.
  It is used in the same way, except that you don't have to specify file names.
  So, if you are looking for a <i>needle</i> anywhere in your file system, all
  you have to do is say <i>glimpse needle</i> and all lines containing
  <i>needle</i> will appear preceded by the file name. See man glimpse for
  details on how to use glimpse.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Glimpseindex provides three indexing options: a tiny index (2-3% of the total
  size of all files), a small index (7-8%) and a medium-size index (20-30%).
  Search times are normally better with larger indexes (although unless files
  are quite large, the small index is just about as good as the medium one). To
  index all your files, you say <i>glimpseindex ~</i> for tiny index (where ~
  stands for the home directory), <i>glimpseindex -o ~</i> for small index, and
  <i>glimpseindex -b ~</i> for medium.

<i>Glimpseindex</i> builds an index of all text files in all the directories
  specified and all their subdirectories (recursively). It is also possible to
  build several separate indexes (possibly even overlapping). The simplest way
  to index your files is to say
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>glimpseindex -o ~</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The index consists of several files (described in detail below), all with the
  prefix <i>.glimpse_</i> stored in the user's home directory (unless otherwise
  specified with the -H option). Files with one of the following suffixes are
  not indexed: &quot;.o&quot;, &quot;.gz&quot;, &quot;.Z&quot;, &quot;.z&quot;,
  &quot;.hqx&quot;, &quot;.zip&quot;, &quot;.tar&quot;. (Unless the -z option is
  used, see below.) In addition, glimpseindex attempts to determine whether a
  file is a text file and does not index files that it thinks are not text
  files. Numbers are not indexed unless the -n option is used. It is possible to
  prevent specified files from being indexed by adding their names to the
  .glimpse_exclude file (described below). The -o option builds a larger index
  than without it (typically about 7-8% vs. 2-3% without -o) allowing for a
  faster search (1-5 times faster). The -b builds an even larger index and
  allows an even faster search some of the time (-b is helpful mostly when large
  files are present). There is an incremental indexing option <i>-f</i>, which
  updates an existing index by determining which files have been created or
  modified since the index was built and adding them to the index (see -f).
  Glimpseindex is reasonably fast, taking about 20 minutes to index 15,000 files
  of about 200MB (on an Dec Alpha 233) and 2-4 minutes to update an existing
  index. (Your mileage may vary.) It is also possible to increment the index by
  adding a specific file (the -a option).

Once an index is built, searching for <i>pattern</i> is as easy as saying

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="A_DETAILED_DESCRIPTION_OF_GLIMPSEINDEX"><a class="selflink" href="#A_DETAILED_DESCRIPTION_OF_GLIMPSEINDEX">A
  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF GLIMPSEINDEX</a></h1>
Glimpse does not automatically index files. You have to tell it to do it. This
  can be done manually, but a better way is to set it to run every night. It is
  probably a good idea to run glimpseindex manually for the first time to be
  sure it works properly. The following is a simple script to run glimpseindex
  every night. We assume that this script is stored in a file called
  glimpse.script:
<div class="Pp"></div>
glimpseindex -o -t -w 5000 ~ &gt;&amp; .glimpse_out
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
at -m 0300 glimpse.script
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
(It might be interesting to collect all the outputs of glimpse by changing
  &gt;&amp; to &gt;&gt;&amp; so that the file .glimpse_out maintains a history.
  In this case the file must be created before the first time &gt;&gt;&amp; is
  used. If you use ksh, replace '&gt;&amp;' with '2&gt;&amp;1'.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
Glimpseindex stores the names of all the files that it indexed in the file
  .glimpse_filenames. Each file is listed by its full path name as obtained at
  the time the files were indexed. For example, /usr1/udi/file1. Glimpse uses
  this full name when it performs the search, so the name must match the current
  name. This may become a problem when the indexing and the search are done from
  different machines (e.g., through NFS), which may cause the path names to be
  different. For example, /tmp_mnt/R/xxx/xxx/usr1/udi/file1. (The same is true
  for several other .glimpse files. See below.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
Glimpseindex does not follow symbolic links unless they are explicitly included
  in the .glimpse_include file (described below).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Glimpseindex makes an effort to identify non-text files such as binary files,
  compressed files, uuencoded files, postscript files, binhex files, etc. These
  files are automatically not indexed. In addition, all files whose names end
  with `.o', `.gz', `.Z', `.z', `.hqx', `.zip', or `.tar' will not be indexed
  (unless they are specifically included in .glimpse_include - see below).
<div class="Pp"></div>
The options for glimpseindex are as follows:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-a</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">adds the given file[s] and/or directories to an existing
      index. Any given directory will be traversed recursively and all files
      will be indexed (unless they appear in .glimpse_exclude; see below). Using
      this option is generally much faster than indexing everything from
      scratch, although in rare cases the index may not be as good. If for some
      reason the index is full (which can happen unless -o or -b are used)
      glimpseindex -a will produce an error message and will exit without
      changing the original index.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-b</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">builds a medium-size index (20-30% of the size of all
      files), allowing faster search. This option forces glimpseindex to store
      an exact (byte level) pointer to each occurrence of each word (except for
      some very common words belonging to the stop list).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-B</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">uses a hash table that is 4 times bigger (256k entries
      instead of 64K) to speed up indexing. The memory usage will increase
      typically by about 2 MB. This option is only for indexing speed; it does
      not affect the final index.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-d filename(s)</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">deletes the given file(s) from the index.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-D filename(s)</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">deletes the given file(s) from the list of file names, but
      not from the index. This is much faster than -d, and the file(s) will not
      be found by glimpse. However, the index itself will not become
    smaller.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-E</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">does not run a check on file types. Glimpse normally
      attempts to exclude non-text files, but this attempt is not always
      perfect. With -E, glimpseindex indexes all files, except those that are
      specifically excluded in .glimpse_exclude and those whose file names end
      with one of the excluded suffixes.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-f</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">incremental indexing. <i>glimpseindex</i> scans all files
      and adds to the index only those files that were created or modified after
      the current index was built. If there is no current index or if this
      procedure fails, <i>glimpseindex</i> automatically reverts to the default
      mode (which is to index everything from scratch). This option may create
      an inefficient index for several reasons, one of which is that deleted
      files are not really deleted from the index. Unless changes are small,
      mostly additions, and -o is used, we suggest to use the default mode as
      much as possible.</dd>
</dl>

  <dd class="It-tag">Put or update the index and all other .glimpse files
      (listed below) in &quot;directory&quot;. The default is the home
      directory. When glimpse is run, the -H option must be used to direct
      glimpse to this directory, because glimpse assumes that the index is in
      the home directory (see also the -H option in glimpse).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-i</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Make .glimpse_include (SEE GLIMPSEINDEX FILES) take
      precedence over .glimpse_exclude, so that, for example, one can exclude
      everything (by putting *) and then explicitly include files.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-I</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Instead of indexing, only show (print to standard out) the
      list of files that would be indexed. It is useful for filtering purposes.
      (&quot;glimpseindex -I dir | glimpseindex -F&quot; is the same as
      &quot;glimpseindex dir&quot;.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-M x</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Tells glimpseindex to use x MB of memory for temporary
      tables. The more memory you allow the faster glimpseindex will run. The
      default is x=2. The value of x must be a positive integer. Glimpseindex
      will need more memory than x for other things, and glimpseindex may
      perform some 'forks', so you'll have to experiment if you want to use this
      option. WARNING: If x is too large you may run out of swap space.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-n</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Index numbers as well as text. The default is not to index
      numbers. This is useful when searching for dates or other identifying
      numbers, but it may make the index very large if there are lots of
      numbers. In general, glimpseindex strips away any non-alphabetic
      character. For example, the string abc123 will be indexed as abc if the -n
      option is not used and as abc123 if it is used. Glimpse provides warnings
      (in .glimpse_messages) for all files in which more than half the words
      that were added to the index from that file had digits in them (this is an
      attempt to identify data files that should probably not be indexed). One
      can use the .glimpse_exclude file to exclude data files or any other
      files. (See GLIMPSEINDEX FILES.)</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-o</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Build a small index rather than tiny (meaning 7-9% of the
      sizes of all files - your mileage may vary) allowing faster search. This
      option forces glimpseindex to allocate one block per file (a block usually
      contains many files). A detailed explanation of how blocks affect glimpse
      can be found in the glimpse article. (See also LIMITATIONS.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-R</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Recompute .glimpse_filenames_index from .glimpse_filenames.
      The file .glimpse_filenames_index speeds up processing. Glimpseindex
      usually computes it automatically. However, if for some reason one wants
      to change the path names of the files listed in .glimpse_filenames, then
      running glimpseindex -R recomputes .glimpse_filenames_index. This is
      useful if the index is computed on one machine, but is used on another
      (with the same hierarchy). The names of the files listed in
      .glimpse_filenames are used in runtime, so changing them can be done at
      any time in any way (as long as just the names not the content is
      changed). This is not really an option in the regular sense; rather, it is
      a program by itself, and it is meant as a post-processing step. (Avaliable
      only from version 3.6.)</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-S k</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The number k determines the size of the <i>stop-list</i>.
      The stop-list consists of words that are too common and are not indexed
      (e.g., 'the' or 'and'). Instead of having a fixed stop-list, glimpseindex
      figures out the words that are too common for every index separately. The
      rules are different for the different indexing options. The tiny index
      contains all words (the savings from a stop-list are too small to bother).
      The small index (-o), the number k is a percentage threshold. A word will
      be in the stop list if it appears in at least k% of all files. The default
      value is 80%. (If there are less than 256 files, then the stop-list is not
      maintained.) The medium index (-b) counts all occurrences of all words,
      and a word is added to the stop-list if it appears at least k times per
      MByte. The default value is 500. A query that includes a stop list word is
      of course less efficient. (See also LIMITATIONS below.)</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-t</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">(A new option in version 3.5.) The order in which files are
      indexed is determined by scanning the directories, which is mostly
      arbitrary. With the -t option, combined with either -o and -b, the indexed
      files are stored in reversed order of modification age (younger files
      first). Results of queries are then automatically returned in this order.
      Furthermore, glimpse can filter results by age; for example, asking to
      look at only files that are at most 5 days old.</dd>

</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-w k</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Glimpseindex does a reasonable, but not a perfect, job of
      determining which files should not be indexed. Sometimes a large text file
      should not be indexed; for example, a dictionary may match most queries.
      The -w option stores in a file called .glimpse_messages (in the same
      directory as the index) the list of all files that contribute at least
      <i>k</i> new words to the index. The user can look at this list of files
      and decide which should or should not be indexed. The file
      .glimpse_exclude contains files that will not be indexed (see more below).
      We recommend to set <i>k</i> to about 1000. This is not an exact measure.
      For example, if the same file appears twice, then the second copy will not
      contribute any new words to the dictionary (but if you exclude the first
      copy and index again, the second copy will contribute).</dd>

      added to improve the performance of WebGlimpse.) Works only on files whose
      names end with .html, .htm, .shtml, and .shtm. (see
      glimpse.h/EXTRACT_INFO_SUFFIX to add to these suffixes.) The routine to
      extract titles is called extract_info, in index/filetype.c. This feature
      can be modified in various ways to extract info from many filetypes. The
      titles are appended to the corresponding filenames with a space separator.
      Glimpseindex assumes that filenames don't have spaces in them.</dd>

  <dd class="It-tag">Allow customizable filtering, using the file
      .glimpse_filters to perform the programs listed there for each match. The

    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    *.Z uncompress &lt;
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    (separated by tabs) then before indexing any file that matches the pattern
      &quot;*.Z&quot; (same syntax as the one for .glimpse_exclude) the command
      listed is executed first (assuming input is from stdin, which is why
      uncompress needs &lt;) and its output (assuming it goes to stdout) is
      indexed. The file itself is not changed (i.e., it stays compressed). Then
      if glimpse -z is used, the same program is used on these files on the fly.
      Any program can be used (we run 'exec'). For example, one can filter out
      parts of files that should not be indexed. Glimpseindex tries to apply all
      filters in .glimpse_filters in the order they are given. For example, if
      you want to uncompress a file and then extract some part of it, put the
      compression command (the example above) first and then another line that
      specifies the extraction. Note that this can slow down the search because
      the filters need to be run before files are searched.</dd>

  <dt class="It-tag"><b>.glimpse_exclude</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">contains a list of files that glimpseindex is explicitly
      told to ignore. In general, the syntax of .glimpse_exclude/include is the
      same as that of agrep (or any other grep). The lines in the
      .glimpse_exclude file are matched to the file names, and if they match,
      the files are excluded. Notice that agrep matches to parts of the string!
      e.g., agrep /ftp/pub will match /home/ftp/pub and /ftp/pub/whatever. So,
      if you want to exclude /ftp/pub/core, you just list it, as is, in the
      .glimpse_exclude file. If you put &quot;/home/ftp/pub/cdrom&quot; in
      .glimpse_exclude, every file name that matches that string will be
      excluded, meaning all files below it. You can use ^ to indicate the
      beginning of a file name, and $ to indicate the end of one, and you can
      use * and ? in the usual way. For example /ftp/*html will exclude
      /ftp/pub/foo.html, but will also exclude /home/ftp/pub/html/whatever; if
      you want to exclude files that start with /ftp and end with html use
      ^/ftp*html$ Notice that putting a * at the beginning or at the end is
      redundant (in fact, in this case glimpseindex will remove the * when it
      does the indexing). No other meta characters are allowed in
      .glimpse_exclude (e.g., don't use .* or # or |). Lines with * or ? must
      have no more than 30 characters. Notice that, although the index itself

Glimpse can search for Boolean combinations of &quot;attribute=value&quot; terms
  by using the Harvest SOIF parser library (in glimpse/libtemplate). To search
  this way, the index must be made by using the -s option of glimpseindex (this
  can be used in conjunction with other glimpseindex options). For glimpse and
  glimpseindex to recognize &quot;structured&quot; files, they must be in SOIF
  format. In this format, each value is prefixed by an attribute-name with the
  size of the value (in bytes) present in &quot;{}&quot; after the name of the
  attribute. For example, The following lines are part of an SOIF file:
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
type{17}:       Directory-Listing
md5{32}:        3858c73d68616df0ed58a44d306b12ba
</pre>
Any string can serve as an attribute name. Glimpse
  &quot;pattern;type=Directory-Listing&quot; will search for &quot;pattern&quot;
  only in files whose type is &quot;Directory-Listing&quot;. The file itself is
  considered to be one &quot;object&quot; and its name/url appears as the first
  attribute with an &quot;@&quot; prefix; e.g., @FILE { http://xxx... } The
  scope of Boolean operations changes from records (lines) to whole files when
  structured queries are used in glimpse (since individual query terms can look
  at different attributes and they may not be &quot;covered&quot; by the
  record/line). Note that glimpse can only search for patterns in the value
  parts of the SOIF file: there are some attributes (like the TTL, MD5, etc.)
  that are interpreted by Harvest's internal routines. See RFC 2655 for more
  detailed information of the SOIF format.

The index of glimpse is word based. A pattern that contains more than one word
  cannot be found in the index. The way glimpse overcomes this weakness is by
  splitting any multi-word pattern into its set of words and looking for all of
  them in the index. For example, <b>glimpse 'linear programming'</b> will first
  consult the index to find all files containing both <i>linear</i> and
  <i>programming</i>, and then apply agrep to find the combined pattern. This is
  usually an effective solution, but it can be slow for cases where both words
  are very common, but their combination is not.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The index of glimpse stores all patterns in lower case. When glimpse searches
  the index it first converts all patterns to lower case, finds the appropriate
  files, and then searches the actual files using the original patterns. So, for
  example, <i>glimpse ABCXYZ</i> will first find all files containing abcxyz in
  any combination of lower and upper cases, and then searches these files
  directly, so only the right cases will be found. One problem with this
  approach is discovering misspellings that are caused by wrong cases. For
  example, <i>glimpse -B abcXYZ</i> will first search the index for the best
  match to abcxyz (because the pattern is converted to lower case); it will find
  that there are matches with no errors, and will go to those files to search
  them directly, this time with the original upper cases. If the closest match
  is, say AbcXYZ, glimpse may miss it, because it doesn't expect an error.
  Another problem is speed. If you search for &quot;ATT&quot;, it will look at
  the index for &quot;att&quot;. Unless you use -w to match the whole word,
  glimpse may have to search all files containing, for example,
  &quot;Seattle&quot; which has &quot;att&quot; in it.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There is no size limit for simple patterns and simple patterns with Boolean AND
  or OR. More complicated patterns are currently limited to approximately 30
  characters. Lines are limited to 1024 characters. Records are limited to 48K,
  and may be truncated if they are larger than that. The limit of record length
  can be changed by modifying the parameter Max_record in agrep.h.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Each line in .glimpse_exclude or .glimpse_include that contains a * or a ? must
  not exceed 30 characters length.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Glimpseindex does not index words of size &gt; 64.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A medium-size index (-b) may lead to actually slower query times if the files
  are all very small.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Under -b, it may be impossible to make the stop list empty. Glimpseindex is
  using the &quot;sort&quot; routine, and all occurrences of a word appear at
  some point on one line. Sort is limiting the size of lines it can handle (the
  value depends on the platform; ours is 16KB). If the lines are too big, the
  word is added to the stop list.
