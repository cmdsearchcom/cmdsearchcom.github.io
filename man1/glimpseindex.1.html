<p>GLIMPSEINDEX(1) General Commands Manual
GLIMPSEINDEX(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
glimpseindex - index whole file systems to be searched by
glimpse</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OVERVIEW <br>
Glimpse (which stands for GLobal IMPlicit SEarch) is a
popular UNIX indexing and query system that allows you to
search through a large set of files very quickly.
Glimpseindex <br>
is the indexing program for glimpse. Glimpse supports most
of agrep&rsquo;s options (agrep is our powerful version of
grep) including approximate matching (e.g., finding
misspelled <br>
words), Boolean queries, and even some limited forms of
regular expressions. It is used in the same way, except that
you don&rsquo;t have to specify file names. So, if you are
look&acirc; <br>
ing for a needle anywhere in your file system, all you have
to do is say glimpse needle and all lines containing needle
will appear preceded by the file name. See man glimpse <br>
for details on how to use glimpse.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Glimpseindex provides three
indexing options: a tiny index (2-3% of the total size of
all files), a small index (7-8%) and a medium-size index
(20-30%). Search times are nor&acirc; <br>
mally better with larger indexes (although unless files are
quite large, the small index is just about as good as the
medium one). To index all your files, you say glimpseindex
<br>
~ for tiny index (where ~ stands for the home directory),
glimpseindex -o ~ for small index, and glimpseindex -b ~ for
medium.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
glimpseindex [ -abEfFiInostT -w number -dD filename(s) -H
directory -M number -S number ] directory_name[s]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INTRODUCTION <br>
Glimpseindex builds an index of all text files in all the
directories specified and all their subdirectories
(recursively). It is also possible to build several separate
indexes <br>
(possibly even overlapping). The simplest way to index your
files is to say</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">glimpseindex -o ~</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The index consists of several
files (described in detail below), all with the prefix
.glimpse_ stored in the user&rsquo;s home directory (unless
otherwise specified with the -H <br>
option). Files with one of the following suffixes are not
indexed: &quot;.o&quot;, &quot;.gz&quot;, &quot;.Z&quot;,
&quot;.z&quot;, &quot;.hqx&quot;, &quot;.zip&quot;,
&quot;.tar&quot;. (Unless the -z option is used, see below.)
In addition, <br>
glimpseindex attempts to determine whether a file is a text
file and does not index files that it thinks are not text
files. Numbers are not indexed unless the -n option is <br>
used. It is possible to prevent specified files from being
indexed by adding their names to the .glimpse_exclude file
(described below). The -o option builds a larger index <br>
than without it (typically about 7-8% vs. 2-3% without -o)
allowing for a faster search (1-5 times faster). The -b
builds an even larger index and allows an even faster search
<br>
some of the time (-b is helpful mostly when large files are
present). There is an incremental indexing option -f, which
updates an existing index by determining which files have
<br>
been created or modified since the index was built and
adding them to the index (see -f). Glimpseindex is
reasonably fast, taking about 20 minutes to index 15,000
files of about <br>
200MB (on an Dec Alpha 233) and 2-4 minutes to update an
existing index. (Your mileage may vary.) It is also possible
to increment the index by adding a specific file (the -a
<br>
option).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once an index is built,
searching for pattern is as easy as saying</p>

glimpse&rsquo;s options and features.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF
GLIMPSEINDEX <br>
Glimpse does not automatically index files. You have to tell
it to do it. This can be done manually, but a better way is
to set it to run every night. It is probably a good <br>
idea to run glimpseindex manually for the first time to be
sure it works properly. The following is a simple script to
run glimpseindex every night. We assume that this script
<br>
is stored in a file called glimpse.script:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">glimpseindex -o -t -w 5000 ~
&gt;&amp; .glimpse_out <br>
at -m 0300 glimpse.script <br>
(It might be interesting to collect all the outputs of
glimpse by changing &gt;&amp; to &gt;&gt;&amp; so that the
file .glimpse_out maintains a history. In this case the file
must be created <br>
before the first time &gt;&gt;&amp; is used. If you use ksh,
replace &rsquo;&gt;&amp;&rsquo; with
&rsquo;2&gt;&amp;1&rsquo;.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Glimpseindex stores the names of
all the files that it indexed in the file
.glimpse_filenames. Each file is listed by its full path
name as obtained at the time the files were <br>
indexed. For example, /usr1/udi/file1. Glimpse uses this
full name when it performs the search, so the name must
match the current name. This may become a problem when the
<br>
indexing and the search are done from different machines
(e.g., through NFS), which may cause the path names to be
different. For example, /tmp_mnt/R/xxx/xxx/usr1/udi/file1.
<br>
(The same is true for several other .glimpse files. See
below.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Glimpseindex does not follow
symbolic links unless they are explicitly included in the
.glimpse_include file (described below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Glimpseindex makes an effort to
identify non-text files such as binary files, compressed
files, uuencoded files, postscript files, binhex files, etc.
These files are automati&acirc; <br>
cally not indexed. In addition, all files whose names end
with &lsquo;.o&rsquo;, &lsquo;.gz&rsquo;, &lsquo;.Z&rsquo;,
&lsquo;.z&rsquo;, &lsquo;.hqx&rsquo;, &lsquo;.zip&rsquo;, or
&lsquo;.tar&rsquo; will not be indexed (unless they are
specifically included in <br>
.glimpse_include - see below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The options for glimpseindex are
as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a adds the given file[s] and/or
directories to an existing index. Any given directory will
be traversed recursively and all files will be indexed
(unless they appear in <br>
.glimpse_exclude; see below). Using this option is generally
much faster than indexing everything from scratch, although
in rare cases the index may not be as good. If <br>
for some reason the index is full (which can happen unless
-o or -b are used) glimpseindex -a will produce an error
message and will exit without changing the original <br>
index.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b builds a medium-size index
(20-30% of the size of all files), allowing faster search.
This option forces glimpseindex to store an exact (byte
level) pointer to each <br>
occurrence of each word (except for some very common words
belonging to the stop list).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B uses a hash table that is 4
times bigger (256k entries instead of 64K) to speed up
indexing. The memory usage will increase typically by about
2 MB. This option is only <br>
for indexing speed; it does not affect the final index.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d filename(s) <br>
deletes the given file(s) from the index.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D filename(s) <br>
deletes the given file(s) from the list of file names, but
not from the index. This is much faster than -d, and the
file(s) will not be found by glimpse. However, the <br>
index itself will not become smaller.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E does not run a check on file
types. Glimpse normally attempts to exclude non-text files,
but this attempt is not always perfect. With -E,
glimpseindex indexes all files, <br>
except those that are specifically excluded in
.glimpse_exclude and those whose file names end with one of
the excluded suffixes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f incremental indexing.
glimpseindex scans all files and adds to the index only
those files that were created or modified after the current
index was built. If there is no <br>
current index or if this procedure fails, glimpseindex
automatically reverts to the default mode (which is to index
everything from scratch). This option may create an <br>
inefficient index for several reasons, one of which is that
deleted files are not really deleted from the index. Unless
changes are small, mostly additions, and -o is <br>
used, we suggest to use the default mode as much as
possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F Glimpseindex receives the
list of files to index from standard input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H directory <br>
Put or update the index and all other .glimpse files (listed
below) in &quot;directory&quot;. The default is the home
directory. When glimpse is run, the -H option must be used
to <br>
direct glimpse to this directory, because glimpse assumes
that the index is in the home directory (see also the -H
option in glimpse).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i Make .glimpse_include (SEE
GLIMPSEINDEX FILES) take precedence over .glimpse_exclude,
so that, for example, one can exclude everything (by putting
*) and then explicitly <br>
include files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I Instead of indexing, only
show (print to standard out) the list of files that would be
indexed. It is useful for filtering purposes.
(&quot;glimpseindex -I dir | glimpseindex <br>
-F&quot; is the same as &quot;glimpseindex dir&quot;.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M x Tells glimpseindex to use x
MB of memory for temporary tables. The more memory you allow
the faster glimpseindex will run. The default is x=2. The
value of x must be a <br>
positive integer. Glimpseindex will need more memory than x
for other things, and glimpseindex may perform some
&rsquo;forks&rsquo;, so you&rsquo;ll have to experiment if
you want to use <br>
this option. WARNING: If x is too large you may run out of
swap space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Index numbers as well as
text. The default is not to index numbers. This is useful
when searching for dates or other identifying numbers, but
it may make the index very <br>
large if there are lots of numbers. In general, glimpseindex
strips away any non-alphabetic character. For example, the
string abc123 will be indexed as abc if the -n <br>
option is not used and as abc123 if it is used. Glimpse
provides warnings (in .glimpse_messages) for all files in
which more than half the words that were added to the <br>
index from that file had digits in them (this is an attempt
to identify data files that should probably not be indexed).
One can use the .glimpse_exclude file to exclude <br>
data files or any other files. (See GLIMPSEINDEX FILES.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o Build a small index rather
than tiny (meaning 7-9% of the sizes of all files - your
mileage may vary) allowing faster search. This option forces
glimpseindex to allocate <br>
one block per file (a block usually contains many files). A
detailed explanation of how blocks affect glimpse can be
found in the glimpse article. (See also LIMITA&acirc; <br>
TIONS.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R Recompute
.glimpse_filenames_index from .glimpse_filenames. The file
.glimpse_filenames_index speeds up processing. Glimpseindex
usually computes it automatically. How&acirc; <br>
ever, if for some reason one wants to change the path names
of the files listed in .glimpse_filenames, then running
glimpseindex -R recomputes .glimpse_filenames_index. <br>
This is useful if the index is computed on one machine, but
is used on another (with the same hierarchy). The names of
the files listed in .glimpse_filenames are used in <br>
runtime, so changing them can be done at any time in any way
(as long as just the names not the content is changed). This
is not really an option in the regular sense; <br>
rather, it is a program by itself, and it is meant as a
post-processing step. (Avaliable only from version 3.6.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s supports structured queries.
This option was added to support the Harvest project and it
is applicable mostly in that context. See STRUCTURED QUERIES
below for more <br>
information and also http://harvest.sourceforge.net/ for
more information about the Harvest project.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S k The number k determines the
size of the stop-list. The stop-list consists of words that
are too common and are not indexed (e.g., &rsquo;the&rsquo;
or &rsquo;and&rsquo;). Instead of having a <br>
fixed stop-list, glimpseindex figures out the words that are
too common for every index separately. The rules are
different for the different indexing options. The tiny <br>
index contains all words (the savings from a stop-list are
too small to bother). The small index (-o), the number k is
a percentage threshold. A word will be in the stop <br>
list if it appears in at least k% of all files. The default
value is 80%. (If there are less than 256 files, then the
stop-list is not maintained.) The medium index <br>
(-b) counts all occurrences of all words, and a word is
added to the stop-list if it appears at least k times per
MByte. The default value is 500. A query that includes <br>
a stop list word is of course less efficient. (See also
LIMITATIONS below.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t (A new option in version
3.5.) The order in which files are indexed is determined by
scanning the directories, which is mostly arbitrary. With
the -t option, combined <br>
with either -o and -b, the indexed files are stored in
reversed order of modification age (younger files first).
Results of queries are then automatically returned in <br>
this order. Furthermore, glimpse can filter results by age;
for example, asking to look at only files that are at most 5
days old.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T builds the turbo file.
Starting at version 3.0, this is the default, so using this
option has no effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w k Glimpseindex does a
reasonable, but not a perfect, job of determining which
files should not be indexed. Sometimes a large text file
should not be indexed; for example, a <br>
dictionary may match most queries. The -w option stores in a
file called .glimpse_messages (in the same directory as the
index) the list of all files that contribute at <br>
least k new words to the index. The user can look at this
list of files and decide which should or should not be
indexed. The file .glimpse_exclude contains files that <br>
will not be indexed (see more below). We recommend to set k
to about 1000. This is not an exact measure. For example, if
the same file appears twice, then the second <br>
copy will not contribute any new words to the dictionary
(but if you exclude the first copy and index again, the
second copy will contribute).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X (starting at version 4.0B1)
Extract titles from HTML pages and add the titles to the
index (in .glimpse_filenames). (This feature was added to
improve the performance of <br>
WebGlimpse.) Works only on files whose names end with .html,
.htm, .shtml, and .shtm. (see glimpse.h/EXTRACT_INFO_SUFFIX
to add to these suffixes.) The routine to <br>
extract titles is called extract_info, in index/filetype.c.
This feature can be modified in various ways to extract info
from many filetypes. The titles are appended to <br>
the corresponding filenames with a space separator.
Glimpseindex assumes that filenames don&rsquo;t have spaces
in them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z Allow customizable filtering,
using the file .glimpse_filters to perform the programs
listed there for each match. The best example is
compress/decompress. If <br>
.glimpse_filters include the line <br>
*.Z uncompress &lt; <br>
(separated by tabs) then before indexing any file that
matches the pattern &quot;*.Z&quot; (same syntax as the one
for .glimpse_exclude) the command listed is executed first
(assum&acirc; <br>
ing input is from stdin, which is why uncompress needs &lt;)
and its output (assuming it goes to stdout) is indexed. The
file itself is not changed (i.e., it stays com&acirc; <br>
pressed). Then if glimpse -z is used, the same program is
used on these files on the fly. Any program can be used (we
run &rsquo;exec&rsquo;). For example, one can filter out
parts <br>
of files that should not be indexed. Glimpseindex tries to
apply all filters in .glimpse_filters in the order they are
given. For example, if you want to uncompress a <br>
file and then extract some part of it, put the compression
command (the example above) first and then another line that
specifies the extraction. Note that this can slow <br>
down the search because the filters need to be run before
files are searched.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GLIMPSEINDEX FILES <br>
All files used by glimpse are located at the directory(ies)
where the index(es) is (are) stored and have .glimpse_ as a
prefix. The first two files (.glimpse_exclude and <br>
.glimpse_include) are optionally supplied by the user. The
other files are built and read by glimpse.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">.glimpse_exclude <br>
contains a list of files that glimpseindex is explicitly
told to ignore. In general, the syntax of
.glimpse_exclude/include is the same as that of agrep (or
any other <br>
grep). The lines in the .glimpse_exclude file are matched to
the file names, and if they match, the files are excluded.
Notice that agrep matches to parts of the string! <br>
e.g., agrep /ftp/pub will match /home/ftp/pub and
/ftp/pub/whatever. So, if you want to exclude /ftp/pub/core,
you just list it, as is, in the .glimpse_exclude file. If
<br>
you put &quot;/home/ftp/pub/cdrom&quot; in .glimpse_exclude,
every file name that matches that string will be excluded,
meaning all files below it. You can use ^ to indicate the
<br>
beginning of a file name, and $ to indicate the end of one,
and you can use * and ? in the usual way. For example
/ftp/*html will exclude /ftp/pub/foo.html, but will also
<br>
exclude /home/ftp/pub/html/whatever; if you want to exclude
files that start with /ftp and end with html use ^/ftp*html$
Notice that putting a * at the beginning or at <br>
the end is redundant (in fact, in this case glimpseindex
will remove the * when it does the indexing). No other meta
characters are allowed in .glimpse_exclude (e.g., <br>
don&rsquo;t use .* or # or |). Lines with * or ? must have
no more than 30 characters. Notice that, although the index
itself will not be indexed, the list of file names <br>
(.glimpse_filenames) will be indexed unless it is explicitly
listed in .glimpse_exclude.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">.glimpse_filters <br>
See the description above for the -z option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">.glimpse_include <br>
contains a list of files that glimpseindex is explicitly
told to include in the index even though they may look like
non-text files. Symbolic links are followed by glimp&acirc;
<br>
seindex only if they are specifically included here. The
syntax is the same as the one for .glimpse_exclude (see
there). If a file is in both .glimpse_exclude and <br>
.glimpse_include it will be excluded unless -i is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">.glimpse_filenames <br>
contains the list of all indexed file names, one per line.
This is an ASCII file that can also be used with agrep to
search for a file name leading to a fast find com&acirc;
<br>
mand. For example, <br>
glimpse &rsquo;count#.c$&rsquo; ~/.glimpse_filenames <br>
will output the names of all (indexed) .c files that have
&rsquo;count&rsquo; in their name (including anywhere on the
path from the index). Setting the following alias in the
.login <br>
file may be useful: <br>
alias findfile &rsquo;glimpse -h :1
~/.glimpse_filenames&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">.glimpse_index <br>
contains the index. The index consists of lines, each
starting with a word followed by a list of block numbers
(unless the -o or -b options are used, in which case each
<br>
word is followed by an offset into the file
.glimpse_partitions where all pointers are kept). The
block/file numbers are stored in binary form, so this is not
an ASCII <br>
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">.glimpse_messages <br>
contains the output of the -w option (see above).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">.glimpse_partitions <br>
contains the partition of the indexed space into blocks and,
when the index is built with the -o or -b options, some part
of the index. This file is used internally by <br>
glimpse and it is a non-ASCII file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">.glimpse_statistics <br>
contains some statistics about the makeup of the index.
Useful for some advanced applications and customization of
glimpse.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STRUCTURED QUERIES <br>
Glimpse can search for Boolean combinations of
&quot;attribute=value&quot; terms by using the Harvest SOIF
parser library (in glimpse/libtemplate). To search this way,
the index must be <br>
made by using the -s option of glimpseindex (this can be
used in conjunction with other glimpseindex options). For
glimpse and glimpseindex to recognize &quot;structured&quot;
files, they <br>
must be in SOIF format. In this format, each value is
prefixed by an attribute-name with the size of the value (in
bytes) present in &quot;{}&quot; after the name of the
attribute. For <br>
example, The following lines are part of an SOIF file: <br>
type{17}: Directory-Listing <br>
md5{32}: 3858c73d68616df0ed58a44d306b12ba <br>
Any string can serve as an attribute name. Glimpse
&quot;pattern;type=Directory-Listing&quot; will search for
&quot;pattern&quot; only in files whose type is
&quot;Directory-Listing&quot;. The file itself <br>
is considered to be one &quot;object&quot; and its name/url
appears as the first attribute with an &quot;@&quot; prefix;
e.g., @FILE { http://xxx... } The scope of Boolean
operations changes from <br>
records (lines) to whole files when structured queries are
used in glimpse (since individual query terms can look at
different attributes and they may not be &quot;covered&quot;
by the <br>
record/line). Note that glimpse can only search for patterns
in the value parts of the SOIF file: there are some
attributes (like the TTL, MD5, etc.) that are interpreted by
<br>
Harvest&rsquo;s internal routines. See RFC 2655 for more
detailed information of the SOIF format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LIMITATIONS <br>
The index of glimpse is word based. A pattern that contains
more than one word cannot be found in the index. The way
glimpse overcomes this weakness is by splitting any multi-
<br>
word pattern into its set of words and looking for all of
them in the index. For example, glimpse &rsquo;linear
programming&rsquo; will first consult the index to find all
files containing <br>
both linear and programming, and then apply agrep to find
the combined pattern. This is usually an effective solution,
but it can be slow for cases where both words are very <br>
common, but their combination is not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The index of glimpse stores all
patterns in lower case. When glimpse searches the index it
first converts all patterns to lower case, finds the
appropriate files, and then <br>
searches the actual files using the original patterns. So,
for example, glimpse ABCXYZ will first find all files
containing abcxyz in any combination of lower and upper
cases, <br>
and then searches these files directly, so only the right
cases will be found. One problem with this approach is
discovering misspellings that are caused by wrong cases. For
<br>
example, glimpse -B abcXYZ will first search the index for
the best match to abcxyz (because the pattern is converted
to lower case); it will find that there are matches with no
<br>
errors, and will go to those files to search them directly,
this time with the original upper cases. If the closest
match is, say AbcXYZ, glimpse may miss it, because it
doesn&rsquo;t <br>
expect an error. Another problem is speed. If you search for
&quot;ATT&quot;, it will look at the index for
&quot;att&quot;. Unless you use -w to match the whole word,
glimpse may have to search <br>
all files containing, for example, &quot;Seattle&quot; which
has &quot;att&quot; in it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is no size limit for
simple patterns and simple patterns with Boolean AND or OR.
More complicated patterns are currently limited to
approximately 30 characters. Lines are <br>
limited to 1024 characters. Records are limited to 48K, and
may be truncated if they are larger than that. The limit of
record length can be changed by modifying the parameter <br>
Max_record in agrep.h.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each line in .glimpse_exclude or
.glimpse_include that contains a * or a ? must not exceed 30
characters length.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Glimpseindex does not index
words of size &gt; 64.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A medium-size index (-b) may
lead to actually slower query times if the files are all
very small.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Under -b, it may be impossible
to make the stop list empty. Glimpseindex is using the
&quot;sort&quot; routine, and all occurrences of a word
appear at some point on one line. Sort is <br>
limiting the size of lines it can handle (the value depends
on the platform; ours is 16KB). If the lines are too big,
the word is added to the stop list.</p>
