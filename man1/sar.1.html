<p>SAR(1) Linux User&rsquo;s Manual SAR(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
sar - Collect, report, or save system activity
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
sar [ -A ] [ -B ] [ -b ] [ -C ] [ -d ] [ -H ] [ -h ] [ -p ]
[ -q ] [ -R ] [ -r ] [ -S ] [ -t ] [ -u [ ALL ] ] [ -V ] [
-v ] [ -W ] [ -w ] [ -y ] [ -I { int [,...] | SUM | ALL |
<br>
XALL } ] [ -P { cpu [,...] | ALL } ] [ -m { keyword [,...] |
ALL } ] [ -n { keyword [,...] | ALL } ] [ -j { ID | LABEL |
PATH | UUID | ... } ] [ -f [ filename ] | -o [ filename ]
<br>
| -[0-9]+ ] [ -i interval ] [ -s [ hh:mm:ss ] ] [ -e [
hh:mm:ss ] ] [ interval [ count ] ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The sar command writes to standard output the contents of
selected cumulative activity counters in the operating
system. The accounting system, based on the values in the
count <br>
and interval parameters, writes information the specified
number of times spaced at the specified intervals in
seconds. If the interval parameter is set to zero, the sar
command <br>
displays the average statistics for the time since the
system was started. If the interval parameter is specified
without the count parameter, then reports are generated
continu&acirc; <br>
ously. The collected data can also be saved in the file
specified by the -o filename flag, in addition to being
displayed onto the screen. If filename is omitted, sar uses
the <br>
standard system activity daily data file, the
/var/log/sa/sadd file, where the dd parameter indicates the
current day. By default all the data available from the
kernel are <br>
saved in the data file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The sar command extracts and
writes to standard output records previously saved in a
file. This file can be either the one specified by the -f
flag or, by default, the standard <br>
system activity daily data file. It is also possible to
enter -1, -2 etc. as an argument to sar to display data of
that days ago. For example, -1 will point at the standard
sys&acirc; <br>
tem activity file of yesterday.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Without the -P flag, the sar
command reports system-wide (global among all processors)
statistics, which are calculated as averages for values
expressed as percentages, and as <br>
sums otherwise. If the -P flag is given, the sar command
reports activity which relates to the specified processor or
processors. If -P ALL is given, the sar command reports
sta&acirc; <br>
tistics for each individual processor and global statistics
among all processors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can select information about
specific system activities using flags. Not specifying any
flags selects only CPU activity. Specifying the -A flag
selects all possible activi&acirc; <br>
ties.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default version of the sar
command (CPU utilization report) might be one of the first
facilities the user runs to begin system activity
investigation, because it monitors <br>
major system resources. If CPU utilization is near 100
percent (user + nice + system), the workload sampled is
CPU-bound.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If multiple samples and multiple
reports are desired, it is convenient to specify an output
file for the sar command. Run the sar command as a
background process. The syntax for <br>
this is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sar -o datafile interval count
&gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All data are captured in binary
form and saved to a file (datafile). The data can then be
selectively displayed with the sar command using the -f
option. Set the interval and <br>
count parameters to select count records at interval second
intervals. If the count parameter is not set, all the
records saved in the file will be selected. Collection of
data <br>
in this manner is useful to characterize system usage over a
period of time and determine peak usage hours.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: The sar command only
reports on local activities.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-A This is equivalent to specifying -bBdHqrRSuvwWy -I SUM -I
XALL -m ALL -n ALL -u ALL -P ALL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B Report paging statistics. The
following values are displayed:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pgpgin/s <br>
Total number of kilobytes the system paged in from disk per
second.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pgpgout/s <br>
Total number of kilobytes the system paged out to disk per
second.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fault/s <br>
Number of page faults (major + minor) made by the system per
second. This is not a count of page faults that generate
I/O, because some page faults can be resolved <br>
without I/O.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">majflt/s <br>
Number of major faults the system has made per second, those
which have required loading a memory page from disk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pgfree/s <br>
Number of pages placed on the free list by the system per
second.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pgscank/s <br>
Number of pages scanned by the kswapd daemon per second.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pgscand/s <br>
Number of pages scanned directly per second.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pgsteal/s <br>
Number of pages the system has reclaimed from cache
(pagecache and swapcache) per second to satisfy its memory
demands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%vmeff <br>
Calculated as pgsteal / pgscan, this is a metric of the
efficiency of page reclaim. If it is near 100% then almost
every page coming off the tail of the inactive <br>
list is being reaped. If it gets too low (e.g. less than
30%) then the virtual memory is having some difficulty. This
field is displayed as zero if no pages have <br>
been scanned during the interval of time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b Report I/O and transfer rate
statistics. The following values are displayed:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tps <br>
Total number of transfers per second that were issued to
physical devices. A transfer is an I/O request to a physical
device. Multiple logical requests can be com&acirc; <br>
bined into a single I/O request to the device. A transfer is
of indeterminate size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rtps <br>
Total number of read requests per second issued to physical
devices.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wtps <br>
Total number of write requests per second issued to physical
devices.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bread/s <br>
Total amount of data read from the devices in blocks per
second. Blocks are equivalent to sectors and therefore have
a size of 512 bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bwrtn/s <br>
Total amount of data written to devices in blocks per
second.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C When reading data from a
file, tell sar to display comments that have been inserted
by sadc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Report activity for each
block device. When data are displayed, the device
specification dev m-n is generally used ( DEV column). m is
the major number of the device and <br>
n its minor number. Device names may also be pretty-printed
if option -p is used or persistent device names can be
printed if option -j is used (see below). Note that <br>
disk activity depends on sadc options &quot;-S DISK&quot;
and &quot;-S XDISK&quot; to be collected. The following
values are displayed:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tps <br>
Indicate the number of transfers per second that were issued
to the device. Multiple logical requests can be combined
into a single I/O request to the device. A <br>
transfer is of indeterminate size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rd_sec/s <br>
Number of sectors read from the device. The size of a sector
is 512 bytes.</p>

the requests in queue and the time spent ser&acirc; <br>
vicing them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">svctm <br>
The average service time (in milliseconds) for I/O requests
that were issued to the device. Warning! Do not trust this
field any more. This field will be removed in <br>
a future sysstat version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%util <br>
Percentage of elapsed time during which I/O requests were
issued to the device (bandwidth utilization for the device).
Device saturation occurs when this value is <br>
close to 100%.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e [ hh:mm:ss ] <br>
Set the ending time of the report. The default ending time
is 18:00:00. Hours must be given in 24-hour format. This
option can be used when data are read from or written <br>
to a file (options -f or -o ).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f [ filename ] <br>
Extract records from filename (created by the -o filename
flag). The default value of the filename parameter is the
current daily data file, the /var/log/sa/sadd file. The <br>

then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I { int [,...] | SUM | ALL |
XALL } <br>
Report statistics for a given interrupt. int is the
interrupt number. Specifying multiple -I int parameters on
the command line will look at multiple independent

rupts. The SUM keyword indicates that the total number of
interrupts received per second is to be displayed. The ALL
keyword indicates that statistics from the first 16 <br>
interrupts are to be reported, whereas the XALL keyword
indicates that statistics from all interrupts, including
potential APIC interrupt sources, are to be reported. <br>
Note that interrupt statistics depend on sadc option
&quot;-S INT&quot; to be collected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i interval <br>
Select data records at seconds as close as possible to the
number specified by the interval parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-j { ID | LABEL | PATH | UUID |

conjunction with option -d. Options ID, LABEL, etc. specify
the type of the persistent name. These options are not <br>
limited, only prerequisite is that directory with required
persistent names is present in /dev/disk. If persistent name
is not found for the device, the device name is <br>
pretty-printed (see option -p below).</p>

algorithms can lose track of the number of fragments by
combining them as they are received.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fragf/s <br>

specified. The default starting time is 08:00:00. <br>
Hours must be given in 24-hour format. This option can be
used only when data are read from a file (option -f ).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t When reading data from a
daily data file, indicate that sar should display the
timestamps in the original local time of the data file
creator. Without this option, the sar <br>
command displays the timestamps in the user&rsquo;s locale
time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u [ ALL ] <br>
Report CPU utilization. The ALL keyword indicates that all
the CPU fields should be displayed. The report may show the
following fields:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%user <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%soft <br>
Percentage of time spent by the CPU or CPUs to service
software interrupts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%guest <br>
Percentage of time spent by the CPU or CPUs to run a virtual
processor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%gnice <br>
Percentage of time spent by the CPU or CPUs to run a niced
guest.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%idle <br>
Percentage of time that the CPU or CPUs were idle and the
system did not have an outstanding disk I/O request.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: On SMP machines a
processor that does not have any activity at all (0.00 for
every field) is a disabled (offline) processor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Print version number then
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Report status of inode, file
and other kernel tables. The following values are
displayed:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dentunusd <br>
Number of unused cache entries in the directory cache.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file-nr <br>
Number of file handles used by the system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">inode-nr <br>
Number of inode handlers used by the system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pty-nr <br>
Number of pseudo-terminals used by the system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-W Report swapping statistics.
The following values are displayed:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pswpin/s <br>
Total number of swap pages the system brought in per
second.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pswpout/s <br>
Total number of swap pages the system brought out per
second.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w Report task creation and
system switching activity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">proc/s <br>
Total number of tasks created per second.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cswch/s <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-y Report TTY device activity.
The following values are displayed:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rcvin/s <br>
Number of receive interrupts per second for current serial
line. Serial line number is given in the TTY column.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xmtin/s <br>
Number of transmit interrupts per second for current serial
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">framerr/s <br>
Number of frame errors per second for current serial
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">prtyerr/s <br>

line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">brk/s <br>
Number of breaks per second for current serial line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ovrun/s <br>
Number of overrun errors per second for current serial
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
The sar command takes into account the following environment
variables:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">S_TIME_FORMAT <br>
If this variable exists and its value is ISO then the
current locale will be ignored when printing the date in the
report header. The sar command will use the ISO 8601 <br>
format (YYYY-MM-DD) instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">S_TIME_DEF_TIME <br>
If this variable exists and its value is UTC then sar will
save its data in UTC time (data will still be displayed in
local time). sar will also use UTC time instead of <br>
local time to determine the current daily data file located
in the /var/log/sa directory. This variable may be useful
for servers with users located across several time&acirc;
<br>
zones.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
sar -u 2 5 <br>
Report CPU utilization for each 2 seconds. 5 lines are
displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sar -I 14 -o int14.file 2 10
<br>
Report statistics on IRQ 14 for each 2 seconds. 10 lines are
displayed. Data are stored in a file called int14.file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sar -r -n DEV -f
/var/log/sa/sa16 <br>
Display memory and network statistics saved in daily data
file &rsquo;sa16&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sar -A <br>
Display all the statistics saved in current daily data
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
/proc filesystem must be mounted for the sar command to
work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All the statistics are not
necessarily available, depending on the kernel version used.
sar assumes that you are using at least a 2.6 kernel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/var/log/sa/sadd <br>
Indicate the daily data file, where the dd parameter is a
number representing the day of the month.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/proc contains various files
with system statistics.</p>
