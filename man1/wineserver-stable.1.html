<p>WINESERVER(1) Windows on Unix WINESERVER(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
wineserver - the Wine server</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
wineserver [options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
wineserver is a daemon process that provides to Wine roughly
the same services that the Windows kernel provides on
Windows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wineserver is normally launched
automatically when starting wine(1), so you shouldn&rsquo;t
have to worry about it. In some cases however, it can be
useful to start wineserver explic&acirc; <br>
itly with different options, as explained below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-d[n], --debug[=n] <br>
Set the debug level to n. 0 means no debugging information,
1 is the normal level, and 2 is for extra verbose debugging.
If n is not specified, the default is 1. The <br>
debug output will be sent to stderr. wine(1) will
automatically enable normal level debugging when starting
wineserver if the +server option is set in the WINEDEBUG
vari&acirc; <br>
able.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, --foreground <br>
Make the server remain in the foreground for easier
debugging, for instance when running it under a
debugger.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Display a help message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k[n], --kill[=n] <br>
Kill the currently running wineserver, optionally by sending
signal n. If no signal is specified, sends a SIGINT first
and then a SIGKILL. The instance of wineserver that <br>
is killed is selected based on the WINEPREFIX environment
variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p[n], --persistent[=n] <br>
Specify the wineserver persistence delay, i.e. the amount of
time that the server will keep running when all client
processes have terminated. This avoids the cost of <br>
shutting down and starting again when programs are launched
in quick succession. The timeout n is in seconds, the
default value is 0 seconds. If n is not specified, the <br>
server stays around forever.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --version <br>
Display version information and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w, --wait <br>
Wait until the currently running wineserver terminates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
WINEPREFIX <br>
If set, the content of this variable is taken as the name of
the directory where wineserver stores its data (the default
is $HOME/.wine). All wine processes using the same <br>
wineserver (i.e.: same user) share certain things like
registry, shared memory and kernel objects. By setting
WINEPREFIX to different values for different Wine processes,
<br>
it is possible to run a number of truly independent Wine
sessions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WINESERVER <br>
Specifies the path and name of the wineserver binary that
will be launched automatically by wine. If not set, wine
will try to load /usr/lib/wine/wineserver, and if this <br>
doesn&rsquo;t exist it will then look for a file named
wineserver in the path and in a few other likely
locations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
~/.wine <br>
Directory containing user specific data managed by wine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/tmp/.wine-uid <br>
Directory containing the server Unix socket and the lock
file. These files are created in a subdirectory generated
from the WINEPREFIX directory device and inode numbers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHORS <br>
The original author of wineserver is Alexandre Julliard.
Many other people have contributed new features and bug
fixes. For a complete list, see the git commit logs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Bugs can be reported on the Wine bug tracker
&acirc;&uml;http://bugs.winehq.org&acirc;&copy;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AVAILABILITY <br>
wineserver is part of the Wine distribution, which is
available through WineHQ, the Wine development headquarters
&acirc;&uml;http://www.winehq.org/&acirc;&copy;.</p>
