<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
formail is a filter that can be used to force mail into
mailbox format, perform &lsquo;From &rsquo; escaping,
generate auto-replying headers, do simple header
munging/extracting or split up <br>
a mailbox/digest/articles file. The mail/mailbox/article
contents will be expected on stdin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If formail is supposed to
determine the sender of the mail, but is unable to find any,
it will substitute &lsquo;foo@bar&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If formail is started without
any command line options, it will force any mail coming from
stdin into mailbox format and will escape all bogus
&lsquo;From &rsquo; lines with a &lsquo;&gt;&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-v Formail will print its version number and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b Don&rsquo;t escape any bogus
mailbox headers (i.e., lines starting with &lsquo;From
&rsquo;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p prefix <br>
Define a different quotation prefix. If unspecified it
defaults to &lsquo;&gt;&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Y Assume traditional Berkeley
mailbox format, ignoring any Content-Length: fields.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Concatenate continued fields
in the header. Might be convenient when postprocessing mail
with standard (line oriented) text utilities.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z Ensure a whitespace exists
between field name and content. Zap fields which contain
only a single whitespace character. Zap leading and trailing
whitespace on fields <br>
extracted with -x.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Force formail to simply pass
along any non-mailbox format (i.e., don&rsquo;t generate a
&lsquo;From &rsquo; line as the first line).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Generate an auto-reply
header. This will normally throw away all the existing
fields (except X-Loop:) in the original message, fields you
wish to preserve need to be named <br>
using the -i option. If you use this option in conjunction
with -k, you can prevent the body from being
&lsquo;escaped&rsquo; by also specifying -b.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k When generating the
auto-reply header or when extracting fields, keep the body
as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Trust the sender to have used
a valid return address in his header. This causes formail to
select the header sender instead of the envelope sender for
the reply. This <br>
option should be used when generating auto-reply headers
from news articles or when the sender of the message is
expecting a reply.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s The input will be split up
into separate mail messages, and piped into a program one by
one (a new program is started for every part). -s has to be
the last option speci&acirc; <br>
fied, the first argument following it is expected to be the
name of a program, any other arguments will be passed along
to it. If you omit the program, then formail will <br>
simply concatenate the split mails on stdout again. See
FILENO.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n [maxprocs] <br>
Tell formail not to wait for every program to finish before
starting the next (causes splits to be processed in
parallel). Maxprocs optionally specifies an upper limit on
<br>
the number of concurrently running processes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e Do not require empty lines to
be preceding the header of a new message (i.e., the messages
could start on every line).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Tell formail that the
messages it is supposed to split need not be in strict
mailbox format (i.e., allows you to split digests/articles
or non-standard mailbox formats). <br>
This disables recognition of the Content-Length: field.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l folder <br>
Generate a log summary in the same style as procmail. This
includes the entire &quot;From &quot; line, the Subject:
header field, the folder, and the size of the message in
bytes. <br>
The mailstat command can be used to summarize logs in this
format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B Makes formail assume that it
is splitting up a BABYL rmail file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m minfields <br>
Allows you to specify the number of consecutive headerfields
formail needs to find before it decides it found the start
of a new message, it defaults to 2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Tells formail to (still
detect but) be quiet about write errors, duplicate messages
and mismatched Content-Length: fields. This option is on by
default, to make it display <br>
the messages use -q-.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D maxlen idcache <br>
Formail will detect if the Message-ID of the current message
has already been seen using an idcache file of approximately
maxlen size. If not splitting, it will return suc&acirc;
<br>
cess if a duplicate has been found. If splitting, it will
not output duplicate messages. If used in conjunction with
-r, formail will look at the mail address of the enve&acirc;
<br>
lope sender instead at the Message-ID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x headerfield <br>
Extract the contents of this headerfield from the header.
Line continuations will be left intact; if you want the
value on a single line then you&rsquo;ll also need the -c
<br>
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X headerfield <br>
Same as -x, but also preserves/includes the field name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a headerfield <br>
Append a custom headerfield onto the header; but only if a
similar field does not exist yet. If you specify either one
of the field names Message-ID: or Resent-Message-ID: <br>
with no field contents, then formail will generate a unique
message-ID for you.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A headerfield <br>
Append a custom headerfield onto the header in any case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i headerfield <br>
Same as -A, except that any existing similar fields are
renamed by prepending an &lsquo;&lsquo;Old-&rsquo;&rsquo;
prefix. If headerfield consists only of a field-name, it
will not be appended.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I headerfield <br>
Same as -i, except that any existing similar fields are
simply removed. If headerfield consists only of a
field-name, it effectively deletes the field.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u headerfield <br>
Make the first occurrence of this field unique, and thus
delete all subsequent occurrences of it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U headerfield <br>
Make the last occurrence of this field unique, and thus
delete all preceding occurrences of it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R oldfield newfield <br>
Renames all occurrences of the fieldname oldfield into
newfield.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+skip <br>
Skip the first skip messages while splitting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-total <br>
Output at most total messages while splitting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
When renaming, removing, or extracting fields, partial
fieldnames may be used to specify all fields that start with
the specified value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, when generating an
auto-reply header procmail selects the envelope sender from
the input message. This is correct for vacation messages and
other automatic replies <br>
regarding the routing or delivery of the original message.
If the sender is expecting a reply or the reply is being
generated in response to the contents of the original
message <br>
then the -t option should be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RFC822, the original standard
governing the format of Internet mail messages, did not
specify whether Resent header fields (those that begin with
&lsquo;Resent-&rsquo;, such as <br>
&lsquo;Resent-From:&rsquo;) should be considered when
generating a reply. Since then, the recommended usage of the
Resent headers has evolved to consider them as purely
informational and <br>
not for use when generating a reply. This has been codified
in RFC2822, the new Internet Message Format standard, which
states in part:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Resent fields are used to
identify a message as having been reintroduced into the
transport system by a user. The purpose of using resent
fields is to have the message <br>
appear to the final recipient as if it were sent directly by
the original sender, with all of the original fields
remaining the same....They MUST NOT be used in the normal
<br>
processing of replies or other such automatic actions on
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">While formail now ignores Resent
headers when generating header replies, versions of formail
prior to 3.14 gave such headers a high precedence. If the
old behavior is needed for <br>
established applications it can be specified by calling
formail with the option &lsquo;-a Resent-&rsquo; in addition
to the -r and -t options. This usage is deprecated and
should not be <br>
used in new applications.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
FILENO <br>
While splitting, formail assigns the message number
currently being output to this variable. By presetting
FILENO, you can change the initial message number being used
and <br>
the width of the zero-padded output. If FILENO is unset it
will default to 000. If FILENO is non-empty and does not
contain a number, FILENO generation is disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
To split up a digest one usually uses: <br>
formail +1 -ds &gt;&gt;the_mailbox_of_your_choice <br>
or <br>
formail +1 -ds procmail</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To remove all Received: fields
from the header: <br>
formail -I Received:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To remove all fields except
From: and Subject: from the header: <br>
formail -k -X From: -X Subject:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To supersede the Reply-To: field
in a header you could use: <br>
formail -i &quot;Reply-To: foo@bar&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To convert a non-standard
mailbox file into a standard mailbox file you can use: <br>
formail -ds &lt;old_mailbox &gt;&gt;new_mailbox</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Or, if you have a very tolerant
mailer: <br>
formail -a Date: -ds &lt;old_mailbox &gt;&gt;new_mailbox</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To extract the header from a
message: <br>
formail -X &quot;&quot; <br>
or <br>
sed -e &rsquo;/^$/ q&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To extract the body from a
message: <br>
formail -I &quot;&quot; <br>
or <br>
sed -e &rsquo;1,/^$/ d&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
mail(1), binmail(1), sendmail(8), procmail(1), sed(1),
sh(1), RFC822, RFC2822, RFC1123</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
Can&rsquo;t fork Too many processes on this machine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Content-Length: field exceeds
actual length by nnn bytes <br>
The Content-Length: field in the header specified a length
that was longer than the actual body. This causes this
message to absorb a number of subsequent <br>
messages following it in the same mailbox.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Couldn&rsquo;t write to stdout
<br>
The program that formail was trying to pipe into
didn&rsquo;t accept all the data formail sent to it; this
diagnostic can be suppressed by the -q option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Duplicate key found: x The
Message-ID or sender x in this message was found in the
idcache; this diagnostic can be suppressed by the -q
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Failed to execute &quot;x&quot;
Program not in path, or not executable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File table full Too many open
files on this machine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Invalid field-name:
&quot;x&quot; <br>
The specified field-name &quot;x&quot; contains control
characters, or cannot be a partial field-name for this
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WARNINGS <br>
You can save yourself and others a lot of grief if you try
to avoid using this autoreply feature on mails coming
through mailinglists. Depending on the format of the
incoming <br>
mail (which in turn depends on both the original
sender&rsquo;s mail agent and the mailinglist setup) formail
could decide to generate an autoreply header that replies to
the list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the tradition of UN*X
utilities, formail will do exactly what you ask it to, even
if it results in a non-RFC822 compliant message. In
particular, formail will let you gener&acirc; <br>
ate header fields whose name ends in a space instead of a
colon. While this is correct for the leading &lsquo;From
&rsquo; line, that line is not a header field so much as the
message sepa&acirc; <br>
rator for the mbox mailbox format. Multiple occurrences of
such a line or any other colonless header field will be
considered by many mail programs, including formail itself,
as <br>
the beginning of a new message. Others will consider the
message to be corrupt. Because of this, you should not use
the -i option with the &lsquo;From &rsquo; line as the
resulting renamed <br>
line, &lsquo;Old-From &rsquo;, will probably not do what you
want it to. If you want to save the original &lsquo;From
&rsquo; line, rename it with the -R option to a legal header
field such as &lsquo;X- <br>
From_:&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
When formail has to generate a leading &lsquo;From &rsquo;
line it normally will contain the current date. If formail
is given the option &lsquo;-a Date:&rsquo;, it will use the
date from the &lsquo;Date:&rsquo; <br>
field in the header (if present). However, since formail
copies it verbatim, the format will differ from that
expected by most mail readers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If formail is instructed to
delete or rename the leading &lsquo;From &rsquo; line, it
will not automatically regenerate it as usual. To force
formail to regenerate it in this case, include <br>
-a &rsquo;From &rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If formail is not called as the
first program in a pipe and it is told to split up the input
in several messages, then formail will not terminate until
the program it receives <br>
the input from closes its output or terminates itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If formail is instructed to
generate an autoreply mail, it will never put more than one
address in the &lsquo;To:&rsquo; field.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MISCELLANEOUS <br>
Formail is eight-bit clean.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When formail has to determine
the sender&rsquo;s address, every RFC822 conforming mail
address is allowed. Formail will always strip down the
address to its minimal form (deleting ex&acirc; <br>
cessive comments and whitespace).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The regular expression that is
used to find &lsquo;real&rsquo; postmarks is: <br>
&quot;0rom [ ]*[^]+[ ]+[^ ]&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a Content-Length: field is
found in a header, formail will copy the number of specified
bytes in the body verbatim before resuming the regular
scanning for message boundaries <br>
(except when splitting digests or Berkeley mailbox format is
assumed).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any header lines immediately
following the leading &lsquo;From &rsquo; line that start
with &lsquo;&gt;From &rsquo; are considered to be a
continuation of the &lsquo;From &rsquo; line. If instructed
to rename the <br>
&lsquo;From &rsquo; line, formail will change each leading
&lsquo;&gt;&rsquo; into a space, thereby transforming those
lines into normal RFC822 continuations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
Calling up formail with the -h or -? options will cause it
to display a command-line help page.</p>
