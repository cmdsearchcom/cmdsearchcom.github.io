<p>CPP(1) BSD General Commands Manual CPP(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
cpp &acirc; C preprocessor</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
cpp [-ACEMPtVv] [-D macro[=value]] [-d flags] [-I path] [-i
file] [-S path] [-U macro] [infile | -] [outfile]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The cpp utility is a macro preprocessor used by the pcc(1)
compiler. It is mainly used to include header files, expand
macro definitions, discard comments, and perform conditional
<br>
compilation. cpp is written to comply with the ISO/IEC
9899:1999 (&acirc;ISO C99&acirc;) specification.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The infile input file is
optional. If not provided or the file name is &quot;-&quot;
(dash), cpp reads its initial file from standard input. The
outfile output file is also optional, with <br>
output written to standard output if not provided.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The options are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A For assembler-with-cpp input:
treat non-directive lines starting with a # as comments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C Do not discard comments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D macro[=value] <br>
Create a macro definition before processing any input, as if
a</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#define macro value</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">directive had appeared in the
source. If value is not set on the command-line, then a
value of 1 is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d flags <br>
Modify output according to flags, which can be a list of
character flags. The following flags are currently
supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">M Do not process any input, but
output a list of &acirc;#define&acirc; statements for all
defined macros other than builtin macros (see below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">any unknown flags are
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E Modify the exit code, if
there were any warnings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I path <br>
Add path to the list of directories searched by the
&acirc;#include&acirc; directive. This may be used to
override system include directories (see -S option). -I may
be specified <br>
multiple times and is cumulative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i file <br>
Include a file before processing any input, as if a</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#include &quot;file&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">directive had appeared in the
source. -i may be specified multiple times to include
several files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M Instead of producing a
processed C code file, output a list of dependencies for
make(1), detailing the files that need to be processed when
compiling the input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P Inhibit generation of line
markers. This is sometimes useful when running the
preprocessor on something other than C code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S path <br>
Add path to the list of system directories searched by the
&acirc;#include&acirc; directive. The -S option may be
specified multiple times and is cumulative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Traditional cpp syntax. Do
not define the __TIME__, __DATE__, __STDC__, and
__STDC_VERSION__ macros.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U macro <br>
Undefine a macro before processing any input, as if a</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#undef macro</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">directive had appeared in the
source.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Verbose debugging output. -V
can be repeated for greater detail. (This is only available
if the cpp program was built with PCC_DEBUG defined, which
is the default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Display version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -D, -i and -U options are
processed in the order that they appear on the command line,
before any input is read but after the command line options
have been scanned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Files referenced by the
&acirc;#include&acirc; directive as &quot;...&quot;, are
first looked for in the current directory, then as per
&acirc;&uml;...&acirc;&copy; files, which are first looked
for in the list of directories <br>
provided by any -I options, then in the list of system
directories provided by any -S options. Note that cpp does
not define any include directories by default; if no -I or
-S <br>
options are given, then only the current directory will be
searched and no system files will be found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Builtin Macros <br>
A few macros are interpreted inside the cpp program:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">__DATE__ Expands to a quoted
string literal containing the date in the form &quot;Mmm dd
yyyy&quot;, where the names of the months are the same as
those generated by the asctime(3) func&acirc; <br>
tion, and the first character of dd is a space character if
the value is less than 10.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">__FILE__ Expands to a quoted
string literal containing the presumed name of the current
source file. When reading source from standard input, it
expands to &quot;&acirc;&uml;stdin&acirc;&copy;&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">__LINE__ Expands to an integer
constant representing the presumed line number of the source
line containing the macro.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">__STDC__ Expands to the integer
constant &acirc;1&acirc;, meaning that the compiler conforms
to ISO/IEC 9899:1990 (&acirc;ISO C90&acirc;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">__STDC_VERSION__ Expands to the
integer constant &acirc;199901L&acirc;, indicating that cpp
conforms to ISO/IEC 9899:1999 (&acirc;ISO C99&acirc;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">__TIME__ Expands to a quoted
string literal containing the time in the form
&quot;hh:mm:ss&quot; as generated by the asctime(3)
function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also see the -t option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The cpp utility exits with one of the following values:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 Successfully finished. <br>
1 An error occurred. <br>
2 The -E option was given, and warnings were issued.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
as(1), ccom(1), make(1), pcc(1), asctime(3)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY <br>
The cpp command comes from the original Portable C Compiler
by S. C. Johnson, written in the late 70&rsquo;s. The code
originates from the V6 preprocessor with some additions from
V7 <br>
cpp and ansi/c99 support.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A lot of the PCC code was
rewritten by Anders Magnusson.</p>
