<p>COLPLOT(1) colplot COLPLOT(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
colplot - plots collectl data using gnuplot</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
colplot -plot plots [-switches]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTIONS <br>
Generate the plots selected by PLOT(s) on either the
terminal, a file or delivered as email. The switches control
the files to plot, the timeframes, formats and destinations.
<br>
In the case of a web based display, you can run in
&lsquo;live&lsquo; mode which will provide for periodic
screen refreshes for viewing real-time data. See the
web-based help and FAQ for <br>
more detail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PLOTS <br>
The plots themselves are selected from the standard list
(see -showplots) with -plot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-plot <br>
List one or more plot names either separated with commas and
no whitespace or if you want to include whitespace be sure
to enclose the string in quotes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SWITCHES <br>
The remainder of the switches which are all optional fall
into several categories, the first being those that select
the files and timeframes to plot and are as follow:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dir <br>
Look in this directory for plot files rather than the one
pointed to by PlotDir in colplot.conf. A plot file is one
with a known extension and a properly formatted name. <br>
Any files that fail either of these tests will be
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-contains string1 [string2...]
<br>
This field consists of one or more strings separated by
commas or whitespace (if whitespace the entire string must
be quoted). Each selected plot file has its name com&acirc;
<br>
pared to each string. Unless -any is specified, each string
must appear somewhere in that file name for it to continue
to be selected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As a special case, if there is a
string containing a [, it is assumed to be in pdsh format, a
compact format for specifying multiple hostnames, eg
xyz[1-5,10] specifies 6 <br>
hosts whose names all begin with xyz and are followed by one
of 6 values. In this case, only files with hostnames exactly
matching these names will be selected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-all <br>
If specified all strings specified by -contains must match
for a file to be seleceted for plotting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-date from[-thru] <br>
The starting and ending date between which files are
selected for plotting. The dates must be in yyyymmdd
format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-lastmins minutes <br>
Once all the files matching the selection criteria are
discovered, use the more recent file access time to
determine the ending time for plotting data. Note, if
you&rsquo;ve <br>
copied the file from elsewhere and didn&rsquo;t preserve the
last access time in the newly created files this will
produce unexpected results.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-time from[-thru] <br>
The starting and ending time between which data is plotted.
The times must be in hh:mm OR hh:mm:ss format. The hour
portion may be 1 or 2 digits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The next set of switches control
which plots are actually displayed</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-filters string1 [string2...]
<br>
These only apply to detail plots. They select which devices
to produce plots for. Invalid or unknown devics are ignored.
In other words, if one selects &quot;-filters eth <br>
xyz d1&quot; and requests network plots, only ethernet
devices will be displayed. Since &rsquo;xyz&rsquo; is an
invalid selection string it is ignored. Since there are no
network devices <br>
with &rsquo;d1&rsquo; in their names, it too will be
ignored. If one choses network and disk plots, ethernet
devices as well as any disk names with a &rsquo;d1&rsquo; in
them will be displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-type type <br>
By default, plots are geneated using solid lines. However,
one can request a different format be used including points
or stacked line or stacked points.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-unique <br>
If one generates multiple unique plot files per day via the
-ou switch in collectl, those files will be ignored by
colplot. This switch, currently only available via the <br>
CLI will cause those files to be selected and displayed in
the same plot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The next set of switches deal
with plot formatting, typically only used under unusual
circumstances since the default formats meet most needs:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-adjust <br>
Colplot uses a default height for the vertical axis which
can be overridden via -height. However sometimes a plot is
not high enough for all the labels to fit in the leg&acirc;
<br>
end. This switch will keep the user specified height for all
plots in which the legend fits as a single column but
increase the heights of those that aren&rsquo;t high
enough.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-filetype type <br>
This switch must be used in conjunction with selecting a
destination other than the terminal, specifically email or
directory. One can use it to change the default from a <br>
PDF file to either a PNG file for each plot or TTY to send
PNG output for one plot to STDOUT.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-height number <br>
This controls the vertical hight of a plot. This width also
includes the xaxis and you can therefore increase the room
taken by a single plot by choosing -noxaxis.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nolegend number <br>
This removes the legend from the plotting area, causing the
plot to become physically wider.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-noxaxis <br>
This removed the xaxis from the plotting area, causing the
plot to become physically taller.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-thick number <br>
For some people the thickness of the lines in a plot may be
too thin to clearly see the different color variations of
the lines. Versions of gnuplot &gt;= 4.2 support wider <br>
lines and therefore so does colplot. If using scatter plots,
a different plotting symbol is actually used. Values of 2 or
3 are usually sufficient.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-width number <br>
This switch controls the width of a plot where 1 is the size
of a printable page. If set to more than 1 and either -file
or -mail is chosen it will be forced to 1. By <br>
setting this number to less than 1, it may be possible to
fit more than one plot on a page or screen. As this width
also includes the legend, you can further reduce the <br>
plot size by choosing -nolegend.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-xtics n <br>
This causes a tic mark to be drawn on the xaxis every n
seconds. It usually doesn&rsquo;t make sense unless
you&rsquo;ve chosen a fairly narrow timeframe in which to
generate a plot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ylog <br>
Make the y-axis logrithmic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This set of switches deal with
the plot destination when it is NOT the terminal window:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-email address <br>
Linux only. Address to send plot file(s) to. The only syntax
check is for an &rsquo;@&rsquo; to appear somewhere in the
address string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-filedir directory <br>
The name of directory into which the plot file(s) will be
placed. The directory must exist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-href <br>
Print the hrefs that would be used if run from a
browser.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-incctl <br>
Really only intended for users familiar with gnuplot, this
is the control file used to generate the plots. It allows
someone to manually edit the file to change the plot <br>
appearance and/or labels by rerunning gnuplot using its
settings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pagbrk <br>
Instead of generating a page break in a pdf file whenever a
page fills, this flag will cause a page break whenever the
hostname changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-subject subject <br>
Use this subject in email rather than the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">And finally for completeness
there are several types of help:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-help <br>
Standard help.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-showparams <br>
This is really a debugging aid, intended for developers
and/or people building custom plot definitions. When
specified, the plotting parameters for each selected plot
<br>
will be shown. Of particular value is the actual column
number for each data element in each selected file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-showplots <br>
List the names of all the standard plots available for use
with the -plots switch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-version <br>
Show both the versions of both colplot as well as
gnuplot.</p>
