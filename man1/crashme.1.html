<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
crashme - test operating environment software robustness</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
crashme [NBYTES] [SRAND] [NTRYS] [NSUB] [VERBOSE]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
crashme is a very simple program that tests the operating
environment&rsquo;s robustness by invoking random data as if
it were a procedure. The standard signals are caught and
handled <br>
with a setjmp back to a loop which will try again to produce
a fault by executing random data. Some people call this
stress testing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMAND LINE OPTIONS <br>
[NBYTES] <br>
The [NBYTES] should be an integer, specifying the size of
the random data string in bytes. If given negative then the
bytes are printed instead of being executed. If <br>
given with an explicit plus sign then the storage for the
bytes is freshly malloc&rsquo;ed each time. This can have an
effect on machines with separate I and D cache mecha&acirc;
<br>
nisms. The argument can also have a dot in it, X.Y, in which
case Y is a increment for a pointer into the random data.
The buffer is recalculated only when the pointer <br>
gets near the end of the data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The are two magic values for
[NBYTES] : A value of 81920 avoids malloc and returns a
pointer to static data. This makes the operation of crashme
more repeatable on archi&acirc; <br>
tectures where malloc is designed to return unpredictable
locations. A value of 1025 avoids a call that sets the
protection of the data to READ+WRITE+EXEC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[SRAND] The [SRAND] is an input
seed to the random number generator, passed to srand.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[NTRIES] <br>
The [NTRIES] is how many times to loop before exiting
normally from the program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[NSUB] The [NSUB] is optional,
the number of vfork subprocesses running all at once. If
negative run one after another. If given as a time
hrs:mns:scs (hours, minutes, seconds) <br>
then one subprocess will be run to completion, followed by
another, until the time limit has been reached. If this
argument is given as the empty string or . then it is <br>
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When in sequential-subprocess
mode there is a 30 second time limit on each subprocess.
This is to allow the instruction-set-space random walk to
continue when a process <br>
bashes itself into an infinite loop. For example, the ntrys
can be bashed to a very large number with nbytes bashed to
zero. (10 second limit on Windows NT).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The SRAND argument is
incremented by one for each subprocess.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[VERBOSE] <br>
The [VERBOSE] arg is optional. 0 is the least verbose, 5 the
most.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
CRASHLOG <br>
The CRASHLOG is the name of the file which the parent
process opens in write mode and all child processes open in
append mode. There is frequent flushing of the file but <br>
no locking, so the output may be interleaved. If the
operating system crashes then this file might provide a
short-cut to a more resent random number seed sequence to
<br>
allow for quicker finding of the special case that caused
the crash.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CRASHPRNG <br>
The CRASHPRNG can be set to RAND to use the system-provided
rand function, or MT to use the Mersenne twister (default)
as coded by Takuji Nishimura and Makoto Matsumoto, <br>
or VNSQ to use the author&rsquo;s kludge interpretation of
Von Neumann&rsquo;s middle-square method.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLE <br>
This is a suggested test, to run it for a least an hour.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
crashme.c</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
When a signal is caught the number and nature of the signal
is indicated. Setting the environment variable CRASHLOG will
cause each subprocess to record the arguments it was <br>
given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Not all signals are caught, and the state of the user
program/process environment can be sufficiently damaged such
that the program terminates before going through all
[NTRIES] <br>
operations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the architecture uses some
kind of procedure descriptor but no special code has been
not been added to castaway() in crashme.c then the stress
test will not be as potent as it <br>
would otherwise be.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Beware: This program can crash
your computer if the operating system or hardware of same is
buggy. User data may be lost.</p>
