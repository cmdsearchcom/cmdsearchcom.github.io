<p>AMSSHELL(1) AMS executables AMSSHELL(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
amsshell - Asynchronous Message Service (AMS) test message
sender (UNIX)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
amsshell unit_name role_name application_name authority_name
[{ p | s | q | a }]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
amsshell is a message issuance program designed to test AMS
functionality.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When amsshell is started, it
registers as an application module in the unit identified by
unit_name of the venture identified by application_name and
authority_name; the role in <br>
which it registers must be indicated in role_name. A
configuration server for the local continuum and a registrar
for the indicated unit of the indicated venture (which may
both <br>
be instantiated in a single amsd daemon task) must be
running in order for amsshell to run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">amsshell runs as two threads: a
background thread that receives watches for AMS
configuration events (including shutdown), together with a
foreground thread that acquires <br>
operating parameters and message content in lines of console
input to control the issuance of messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first character of each line
of input from stdin to the amsshell indicates the
significance of that line:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">= Sets the name of the subject
on which all messages are to be issued, until superseded by
another &quot;=&quot; line. The subject name must begin at
the second character of this line. <br>
Optionally, subject name may be followed by a single &rsquo;
&rsquo; (space) character and then the text of the first
message to be issued on this subject, which is to be issued
<br>
immediately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">r Sets the number of the role
constraining the domain of message issuance. The role number
must begin at the second character of this line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c Sets the number of the
continuum constraining the domain of message issuance. The
continuum number must begin at the second character of this
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">u Sets the number of the unit
constraining the domain of message issuance. The unit number
must begin at the second character of this line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">m Sets the number of the module
to which subsequent messages are to be issued. The module
number must begin at the second character of this line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">. Terminates amsshell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the first character of a
line of input from stdin is none of the above, the entire
line is taken to be the text of a message that is to be
issued immediately, on the <br>
previously specified subject, to the previously specified
module (if applicable), and subject to the previously
specified domain (if applicable).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, amsshell runs in
&quot;publish&quot; mode: when a message is to be issued, it
is simply published. This behavior can be overridden by
providing a fifth command-line argument <br>
to amsshell - a &quot;mode&quot; indicator. The supported
modes are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">p This is &quot;publish&quot;
mode. Every message is published.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">s This is &quot;send&quot; mode.
Every message is sent privately to the application module
identified by the specified module, unit, and continuum
numbers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">q This is &quot;query&quot;
mode. Every message is sent privately to the application
module identified by the specified module, unit, and
continuum numbers, and amsshell then waits for <br>
a reply message before continuing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a This is &quot;announce&quot;
mode. Every message is announced to all modules in the
domain established by the previously specified role, unit,
and continuum numbers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
-1 amsshell terminated with an error as noted in the ion.log
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;0&quot; amsshell
terminated normally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
A MIB initialization file with the applicable default name
(see amsrc(5)) must be present.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
No environment variables apply.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
amsshell can&rsquo;t register. <br>
amsshell failed to register, for reasons noted in the
ion.log file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">amsshell can&rsquo;t set event
manager. <br>
amsshell failed to start its background thread, for reasons
noted in the ion.log file.</p>
