<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
hfssh - Tcl interpreter with HFS extensions</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
hfssh [script]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
hfssh is a Tcl interpreter like tclsh(1) but which also
implements the following extensions to support manipulation
of Macintosh HFS media:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hfs mount path [partno] <br>
Mounts the indicated HFS partition from the given path. An
HFS volume handle is returned, which may be used for further
volume commands described below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hfs zero path nparts <br>
The given path is overwritten with a Macintosh partition
structure which can accommodate up to nparts partitions. All
space on the medium is initially allocated to an <br>
empty partition, from which new partitions can be created
using hfs mkpart. The number of blocks in this empty space
available for partitioning is returned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hfs mkpart path nblocks <br>
A new HFS partition is created from the available free space
on the specified Macintosh-partitioned medium. The partition
is created with a size of nblocks. Any remaining <br>
free blocks left in the empty partition space can be further
allocated to other new partitions, as long as there are
enough partition slots remaining.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">N.B. When the last remaining
partition slot is used, all remaining free space must be
allocated to it. It is therefore best to consider this when
initially creating the <br>
total number of partition slots with hfs zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hfs nparts path <br>
This command returns the number of HFS partitions which
exist on the Macintosh-formatted medium specified by path.
If path does not appear to have a Macintosh partition <br>
map, or if an error occurs, this command will return -1.
Otherwise, it will return a number greater than or equal to
0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hfs format path partno vname
[bblist] <br>
This command creates a new HFS volume by formatting the
given path and partition partno and giving it a volume label
vname.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If it is desired to
&quot;spare&quot; some blocks from being used by the volume,
a list of &quot;bad block&quot; numbers can be given,
relative to the beginning of the partition. The given <br>
blocks will be mapped out of use (if possible) and the size
of the resulting volume will be decreased.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hfs flushall <br>
All pending changes to all open volumes are flushed
immediately. This is useful to do periodically to avoid
accidental loss of data when volumes are open for long
periods <br>
of time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hfs chartrans fromset toset
string <br>
This command translates the given string from the fromset
character set to the toset set. Both fromset and toset can
be one of latin1 (ISO 8859-1) or macroman (MacOS Stan&acirc;
<br>
dard Roman). A new (translated) string is returned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The translation is not
necessarily reversible, since the two character sets do not
have a complete one-to-one mapping.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hfs version <br>
The current running version of hfsutils is returned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hfs copyright <br>
A copyright notice is returned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hfs author <br>
The name and email address of the author of hfsutils is
returned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hfs license <br>
A license statement for hfsutils is returned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vol vname <br>
The volume name of the given vol handle is returned. This is
also the name of the volume&rsquo;s root directory, needed
to construct absolute pathnames on the volume.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vol size <br>
A list of two numbers is returned; the first is the total
size of the given vol (in bytes), and the second is the
number of free bytes that are currently available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vol crdate <br>
The creation date of the given vol is returned, expressed as
a number of seconds since 00:00:00 01-Jan-1970 UTC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vol mddate <br>
The last modification date of the given vol is returned,
expressed as a number of seconds since 00:00:00 01-Jan-1970
UTC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vol islocked <br>
A boolean value (either 1 or 0) is returned, indicating
whether the given vol handle is locked for read-only access.
It may be locked because the medium is physically <br>
locked through hardware, or because the medium was opened
read-only for special reasons (such as another process also
has the medium open).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vol umount <br>
The indicated vol is unmounted, flushing any unsaved data to
the volume and closing the access path to the medium. The
vol handle subsequently becomes invalid for further <br>
use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vol cwd <br>
A numeric value is returned indicating the catalog node ID
(CNID) of the current working directory on the given vol.
This value can be passed to vol dirinfo to learn the <br>
directory&rsquo;s name and parent CNID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vol path <br>
A list of directory names is returned, representing the
hierarchy between the root and the current directory. These
names can be joined with vol sepchar characters (:) to <br>
construct an absolute pathname to the current directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The same information can be
acquired by traversing the CNIDs from the current directory
to the root using vol dirinfo. (The root directory always
has a CNID of 2.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vol dir [path] <br>
A list is returned describing the contents of the given
directory path (defaulting to the current directory) on the
given vol. Each element of the list describes one <br>
entry, and contains a set of attribute/value pairs
represented as another list, suitable for assignment to a
Tcl array using array set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vol flush <br>
All pending changes to the given volume are flushed
immediately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vol sepchar <br>
The HFS path separator character &quot;:&quot; is
returned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vol cd path <br>
vol chdir path <br>
The current working directory on the given volume is changed
to path, which may be either an absolute or relative
path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vol dirinfo cnid <br>
A two-element list describing the directory having the given
cnid on the given vol is returned. The first element
contains the name of the directory, while the second
ele&acirc; <br>
ment contains the CNID of the directory&rsquo;s parent. Two
CNID values are special: the root directory of the volume
has CNID 2, and the &quot;parent&quot; of the root directory
is <br>
returned with CNID 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vol open path <br>
The file on vol having the given path is opened. An HFS file
handle is returned, which may be used for further file
commands described below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vol stat path <br>
Information about the file or directory having the given
path is returned in much the same way as vol dir except that
only the single argument is described (not its con&acirc;
<br>
tents).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vol mkdir path <br>
A new directory on vol having the given path is created. All
of the parent directories leading to path must already
exist, but path itself must not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vol rmdir path <br>
The directory on vol with the given path is removed. The
directory must be empty.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vol delete path <br>
The file on vol with the given path is removed. Both
resource and data forks of the file are deleted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vol touch path <br>
The modification time for the file or directory specified by
path on the given vol is updated to the current time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vol glob pattern <br>
The given pattern is treated as a list of globbing patterns,
each of which may be expanded to the names of files or
directories on the given vol according to the globbing <br>
rules described in the hfsutils(1) documentation. The
resulting pathnames are returned in a (possibly longer)
list. If a pattern does not match any file or directory <br>
name, it is returned in the resulting list unchanged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vol bless path <br>
The folder named by the given path is &quot;blessed&quot; as
the MacOS System Folder. For this to be useful, the folder
should contain valid Macintosh System and Finder files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vol rename oldpath newpath <br>
The existing oldpath on the given vol is renamed to newpath,
possibly changing its location at the same time. If newpath
already exists, it must be a directory, and the <br>
item will simply be moved into it keeping the same name. (In
the latter case, there must not be another file or directory
already with the same name; in no case will <br>
another file or directory be overwritten.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vol create path type creator
<br>
A new, empty file is created on vol having the given path,
and an HFS file handle is returned in the same manner as vol
open. The file is given the specified MacOS type <br>
and creator codes, which must be 4 character strings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vol copy srcpath dstvol dstpath
<br>
The given file srcpath located on vol is copied to dstpath
located on dstvol (which may be the same as vol). The file
and its attributes are copied verbatim; no transla&acirc;
<br>
tion is performed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vol copyin mode srcpath dstpath
<br>
The specified local (UNIX) srcpath is copied into the given
vol as a file having the specified (HFS) dstpath. A
translation mode must be given as one of macbinary,
bin&acirc; <br>
hex, text, or raw.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vol copyout mode srcpath dstpath
<br>
The specified (HFS) srcpath on the given vol is copied out
as a local file having the specified (UNIX) dstpath. A
translation mode must be given as one of macbinary,
bin&acirc; <br>
hex, text, or raw.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file close <br>
The indicated file is closed, all pending changes to the
file are flushed, and the file handle becomes invalid for
any subsequent operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file tell <br>
A numeric index is returned indicating the character
position within file at which the next read or write
operation will occur.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file stat <br>
Information about the given file is returned in much the
same way as vol stat.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file getfork <br>
If the given file is currently performing I/O on its data
fork, the string &quot;data&quot; is returned. Otherwise,
the string &quot;rsrc&quot; is returned. When files are
opened, they will <br>
default to read/write on their data fork. The current fork
may be changed with file setfork.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file setfork fork <br>
The current fork of the given file is set to fork (which
must be one of data or rsrc), and the current read/write
position is reset to the beginning of the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file seek pos [from] <br>
The character position for the next read or write on file is
changed to pos, relative to the indicated from position,
which must be one of start, current, or end. The <br>
default is to position relative to the start of the
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file read length <br>
length bytes are read from the current read/write position
in file, and these bytes are returned as a string. This
string may be shorter than length in some circumstances,
<br>
or may even be empty, indicating the end of the file has
been reached.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file write string <br>
The given string is written to file at the current
read/write position. The number of bytes actually written to
the file is returned, and may be less than the length of
<br>
the string in unusual circumstances (such as when the volume
is full).</p>

hfsutils(1), hfs(1), tclsh(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
Precautions are taken to ensure all open files and mounted
volumes are cleanly closed and unmounted before exiting the
shell, however abnormal termination (e.g. CTRL-C) can
cir&acirc; <br>
cumvent this, potentially leaving volumes in an inconsistent
state. Judicious use of hfs flushall may help reduce this
risk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Tcl does not provide a mechanism for manipulating arbitrary
binary data. Therefore caution should be used when reading
or writing files containing anything other than plain <br>
text.</p>
