<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Hashcash is a denial-of-service counter measure tool. Its
main current use is to help hashcash users avoid losing
email due to content based and blacklist based anti-spam
sys&acirc; <br>
tems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The hashcash tool allows you to
create hashcash stamps to attach to emails you send, and to
verify hashcash stamps attached to emails you receive. Email
senders attach hashcash <br>
stamps with the X-Hashcash: header. Vendors and authors of
anti-spam tools are encouraged to exempt mail sent with
hashcash from their blacklists and content based filtering
<br>
rules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A hashcash stamp constitutes a
proof-of-work which takes a parameterizable amount of work
to compute for the sender. The recipient can verify received
stamps efficiently.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The hashcash proof-of-work
function is to compute partial hash collisions (the SHA1
hash function is used). By choosing the number of bits of
collision, the work required to <br>
compute a collision can be made arbitrarily expensive --
from fractions of a second to minutes or hours. The
verification is efficient requiring the same small cost
whatever the <br>
collision size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For more detailed discussion of
other applications hashcash has been used for see
http://www.hashcash.org/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USAGE NOTES <br>
In this man page a resource name is the name of the service
or address the stamp is created for. In the case of email,
the resource name is the recipient&rsquo;s email address in
the <br>
form user@domain.com.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Minting stamps</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -m flag must be given to
mint a stamp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The resource name
(recipient&rsquo;s email address) to mint the stamp against
can be passed as an argument, or if omitted is read from
stdin. If stdin is a tty the user is prompted, <br>
if stdin is a pipe the resource name is just silently read.
The desired collision size can be specified with the -b
option. If no collision size is specified, the default is 20
<br>
bits. See also the -b default option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Checking stamps</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -c flag must be given to
check a stamps expiry. The stamp to check can be given as an
argument to &quot;hashcash&quot;. If no stamp is given the
stamp is read from stdin. If stdin <br>
is a tty the user will be prompted, if stdin is a pipe the
stamp is just silently read. A resource name (the
recipient&rsquo;s email address) can be given with the -r
option. If a <br>
resource name is given the resource name is compared to the
resource name in the stamp, if they do not match, the stamp
is rejected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: if no resource name is
given the stamp is anyway checked to see if it is otherwise
valid, but it could be minted for a different resource,
which would allow stamps to be <br>
reused across different resources, so hashcash will return
unchecked exit code on exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Stamps are by default considered
to be valid for 28 days. The validity period can be changed
using the -e flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the stamp has expired or has
a date in the future the stamp is rejected and the program
exits immediately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a required collision size is
given with the -b flag, the stamps value is computed and
compared, if the stamp has insufficent value it is rejected,
and the program exits imme&acirc; <br>
diately. If the -b flag is not given, the stamp is checked
to see if it is otherwise valid, but hashcash will return
unchecked exit code on exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the stamp is double spent the
stamp is rejected. Double spending protection is discussed
in more detail below in &quot;Double Spending
Protection&quot;. If double spending protection <br>
is not enabled, the stamp could be double spent, so hashcash
will return unchecked exit code (exit code 2) on exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -w flag can be used to
request that the number of bits of the collision are counted
and displayed. The -n flag can be used to request that the
resource name in the stamp is <br>
parsed out and displayed. The -l flag can be used to request
the number of seconds until expiry of the stamp is
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The program will only return
exit codes valid or invalid if the -c flag is used, the -b
flag is used, -d, -r resource are used. These are the
minimum set of options necessary to <br>
fully check the validty of a stamp. If these criteria are
not met, the program will return exit code unchecked (exit
code 2) on exit. (See also the -y flag.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Double Spending Protection</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -d flag is used when
checking stamps, a database of spent stamps is kept.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default stamps expire after
28 days, without expiry the database would grow
indefinately. You can specify an alternate expiry period
with the -e flag. The recommended (and <br>
default) expiry period for email is 28 days. After the
expiry period amount of time, the stamp is anyway considered
expired and may be purged from the database to save space.
<br>
(See &quot;Purging Periodically vs on Next Access&quot; for
how to purge stamps.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For efficiency reasons a stamp
is verified before it is checked in the database; if it is
otherwise invalid no database activity will occur.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: The decision about how
long the stamp should be considered valid is up to the
verifier. If it is too short it is possible for some
applications that the stamp will expire <br>
before arriving at the recipient (eg with email.) The
suggested value of 28 days should be safe for normal email
delivery delays. The choice is a trade-off between database
<br>
size and risk of expiry prior to arrival, and depends on the
application.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: Different stamps in the
same database can have different validity periods, so for
example stamps for different resources with different
validity periods can be stored in <br>
the same database, or the recipient may change the validity
period for future stamps without affecting the validity of
old stamps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Purging Periodically vs on Next
Access</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To purge old stamps periodically
while checking stamps use the -p period option to purge no
sooner than the given time period since the last purge.
Purging can be used with the <br>
-k option to purge unexpired stamps also, and with the -j
resource flag to purge only stamps for the given
resource.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are circumstances where it
may be inconvenient to purge stamps on the next access, for
example if there is a large double spend database which
takes some time to purge, and <br>
the response time of the hashcash checker is important. To
avoid this problem, purging can be done separately using
just the -p now option to request just the purge operation.
<br>
On unix for example you could call &quot;hashcash -p
now&quot; in a cron job once per day, or on demand when disk
was running low.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Speed Estimates</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -s flag requests measurement
of how many collisions can be tested per second. No stamp is
minted, or verified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -b flag is used with this
option, instead an estimate of how many seconds it would
take to mint a stamp of the given size in bits is computed.
To find out how much time <br>
it will take to mint a default sized stamp use -s -b
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Notes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All informational output is
printed on stderr. Minted stamps, and results of stamp
verification and timing are printed on stdout. The quiet
flag -q suppresses all informational <br>
output. The -v flag requests more informational output. The
requested output, which is the only information that is
output in quiet mode (when -q is specified) is printed on
<br>
standard output. If stdout is a pipe, or when quiet mode is
in effect the output is printed without description (ie just
bits, just seconds, just resource).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-c Check the expiry information of stamps given as an
argument or on stdin. (Use with -b, -d and -r resource to
fully check stamps).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m Mint stamps with the
resources given as arguments or on stdin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b bits <br>
When minting a stamp, create a collision of at least this
many bits. When verifying a stamp require that it have a
collision of at minimum this many bits, otherwise reject
<br>
it. If omitted the default is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When checking stamps, require
that the stamps have this many bits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default number of bits can
be specified with -b default. Bits relative to the default
can also be specified with -b +n for n bits more than the
default and -b -n for n <br>
bits less than the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b default, -b +0 and -b -0 are
all equivalent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When doing the speed test -s,
can to measure speed of default token with -s -b
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r resource <br>
When minting stamps, the resource name (recipient&rsquo;s
email address) to mint the stamp against can be given either
with -r resource or as an argument to
&quot;hashcash&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When checking stamps, the
resource name (your own email address) is given with the -r
option. If the resource name is given it is checked against
the resource name in the <br>
stamp, and if they do not match the stamp is rejected. Note
if the resource name is not given, stamps for other
resources would be accepted, and therefore hashcash returns
<br>
exit code unchecked (exit code 2) on exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o When verifying stamps
multiple resources can be given. By default the resources
are just checked one by one until a matching valid resource
is found. However when you use <br>
wildcards or regular expressions (see -E), it is useful to
be able to specify that one resource overrides another. For
example this: -b15 -r adam@dev.null -o -b10 *@dev.null <br>
states that mail to address adam@dev.null requires 15 bits,
but mail to *@dev.null requires only 10 bits. If we omitted
the -o override relationship between the two <br>
resources, a stamp of 10 bits would be accepted for address
adam@dev.null because while it would be rejected as having
insufficient bits under the first rule, it would be <br>
accepted under the 2nd rule. The -o option allows you avoid
this problem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e time <br>
Expiry period for spent stamps. While checking stamps (using
the -c flag), if the stamp was minted more than the
specified amount of time ago, it is considered expired. If
<br>
this option is not used, by default stamps expire after 28
days. The expiry period is given in seconds by default (an
argument of 0 means forever). A single character suf&acirc;
<br>
fix can be used to specify alternate units (m = minutes, h =
hours, d = days, M = months, y = Y = years, and s =
seconds).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If used with the -d option, the
spent stamp and its expiry period is recorded in the
database. See the -p option for description of how to purge
stamps from the database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">While minting stamps, the -e
flag can have an effect on the resolution of time created in
the stamp. Without the -e option, the default resolution is
days (time format: YYM&acirc; <br>
MDD). Alternate formats based on range of expiry period are
as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">While minting you can also given
an explicit time width with the -z option instead. (-z
overrides -e if both are given. If neither are given the
default is 6 chars (time <br>
format: YYMMDD)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The rules for automatically
determining appropriate time width from -e if no -z option
is given are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* period &gt;= 2 years then time
format YY is used rounded down to the nearest year start;
<br>
* 2 years &lt; period &lt;= 2 months then time format YYMM
is used rounded down to the nearest month start; <br>
* 2 months &lt; period &lt;= 2 days then time format YYMMDD
is used rounded down to the begining of the nearest day;
<br>
* 2 days &lt; period &lt;= 2 minutes then time format
YYMMDDhhmm is used rounded down to the begining of the
nearest minute; <br>
* period &lt; 2 minutes then time format YYMMDDhhmmss is
used in seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note the rounding down is based
on UTC time, not local time. This can lead to initially
suprising results when rounding down to eg days in time
zones other than GMT (UTC = <br>
GMT). It may be clearer to understand if you use the -u
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z width <br>
The -z option is for use during minting and allows user
choice of width of time width field. See also the -e option
given in combination with -m to specify an implicit time
<br>
field width under the description of the -e flag. Valid
widths are 6,10 or 12 chars corresponding respectively to:
YYMMDD, YYMMDDhhmm, and YYMMDDhhmmss rounded down to the
<br>
nearest day, or minute respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note the rounding down is based
on UTC time, not local time. This can lead to initially
suprising results when rounding down to eg days in time
zones other than GMT (UTC = <br>
GMT). It may be clearer to understand if you use the -u
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g period <br>
The -g option is for use when checking hashcash stamps with
the -c option and specifies a grace period for clock skew,
ie if a hashcash stamp arrives with a date in the <br>
future or in the past it will not be rejected as having a
futuristic date (or as being expired) unless it is more
futuristic (or has been expired for longer) than this <br>
period. The default is 2 days, which means as long as the
sending system&rsquo;s clock is no more than 2 days ahead
(or 2 days behind) of the receiving system&rsquo;s clock,
the hash&acirc; <br>
cash stamp will still be accepted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default units for grace
period are seconds. A single character suffix can be used to
specify alternate units (m = minutes, h = hours, d = days, M
= months, y = Y = <br>
years, and s = seconds).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Store stamps in a double
spend database. If stamp has been seen before it will be
rejected even if it is otherwise valid. The default database
file is database.sdb in the <br>
current directory. Only otherwise valid stamps will be
stored in the database. Only fully validated stamps will be
stored in the database, unless the -y option is given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f dbname <br>
Use dbname instead of default filename for double spend
database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p period <br>
Purges the database of expired stamps if the given time
period has passed since the last time it was purged. As a
convenience -p now is equivalent to -p 0 both of which mean
<br>
purge now, regardless of when the database was last
purged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If used in combination with -j
resource only the stamps minted for the given resource are
purged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If used in combination with -k
all stamps even un-expired stamps are purged. Can be used in
combination with -t time to expire as if the current time
were the given time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k Use with option -p to request
all stamps are purged rather than just expired ones.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-j resource <br>
Use with option -p to request that just stamps matching the
given resource name are to be purged, rather than the
default which is to purge all expired stamps. If the <br>
resource name is the empty string, all stamps are matched
(this is equivalent to omitting the -j option).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note the -E, -M and -S type of
match flags also apply to resources given with the -j
resource flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Print timing information
only, and don&rsquo;t proceed to create a stamp. If combined
with -b bits flag print estimate of how long the requested
collision size would take to com&acirc; <br>
pute, if -s given by itself, just prints speed of the
collision finder. To print an estimate of how long the
default number of bits would take use -b default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Print short usage
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Print more verbose
informational output about the stamp minting or
verification. (If -v is the only argument, prints the tool
version number.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Prints tool version
number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Batch mode. Prints no
information other than output. This option overrides the -v
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X When minting, prints the
hashcash email X-header &rsquo;X-Hashcash: &rsquo; before
the stamp. Without this option just the bare stamp is
printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When checking, after scanning
stamps given as arguments, scans stdin for lines starting
with the string &rsquo;X-Hashcash:&rsquo;, and uses the rest
of the matching line as the stamp. <br>
Only the lines up to and ending at the first blank line are
scanned (see also -i flag which can be used to override
this). A blank line is the separator used to separate the
<br>
headers from the body of a mail message or USENET article.
This is meant to make it convenient to pipe a mail message
or USENET article to hashcash on stdin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x extension <br>
An extension string composed of name value sets. The
extension format is described below in the section on the
hashcash stamp format. This allows users to define their own
<br>
stamp extensions which are hashed into the stamp, verified
by recipients that support them, and ignored by recipients
that don&rsquo;t support them. Note the extension hook
mecha&acirc; <br>
nism has not yet been implemented. This will come in a
subsequent release.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i When checking and using the
-X flag, ignore the blank line boundary between headers and
body of the message, and check for collision in the body too
if one is not found in <br>
the headers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t time <br>
Pretend the current time is the time given for purposes of
minting stamps, verifying stamps and purging old stamps from
the database. Time is given in a format based on UTC&acirc;
<br>
TIME format YYMMDD[hhmm[ss]].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Time is expressed in local time
by default. Use with -u flag to give time in UTC (GMT).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also give time relative
to the current time by prefixing the argument with + or -.
The default units for relative time are seconds. A single
character suffix can be <br>
used to specify alternate units (m = minutes, h = hours, d =
days, M = months, y = Y = years, and s = seconds).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: when time is expressed in
local time, if there is daylight savings in your timezone,
there are one or two ambiguous hours per year at the time of
change from daylight <br>
savings time to normal time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u Input and output absolute
times in UTC (GMT) instead of local time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a period <br>
Add (or subtract if number is negative) a random value from
the current time before minting the stamp. This hides the
time the stamp was created, which may be useful for <br>
anonymous users. Note adding (rather than subtracting) a
random time may be risky if the stamp takes less than the
added time to arrive as the recipient will reject stamps
<br>
with time stamps in the future.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Print resource name parsed
from stamp being verified. Returns exit code unchecked on
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l Print number of seconds left
before stamp expires. Returns exit code unchecked on
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: the calculation includes
the grace period, so can be up to 2 times grace period
longer than you might otherwise expect (clock fast but
system has to presume it could be <br>
slow). If you want to exclude the grace period add -g0 to
set grace period to 0 for the calculation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w Print number of bits of
collision of stamp. Returns exit code unchecked on exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-y Returns success if the stamp
is valid even if it is not fully checked. Use with -c where
not all of -d, -r are specified to get success exit code on
valid but partially <br>
checked stamp. Similarly can use with -n, -l, -w with same
effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M When checking stamps, allow
wildcard * matching in the resource name to make it simpler
to specify multiple email addresses and to allow matching
catch-all addresses and <br>
addresses including subdomains. This is the default. See
also -S, -E and -C</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S When checking stamps use
simple text compare to compare resource names to those in
stamps. See also -M, -E and -C.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E When checking stamps use
regular expressions to specify resource names to make it
simpler to specify multiple email addresses, catch-all
addresses, classes of extension <br>
addresses and addresses including subdomains. Note regular
expression syntax is POSIX style: special characters do not
need to be quoted to have their special meaning; but <br>
they do have to be quoted with &nbsp;to that character in
the searched string. The regular expression automatically
has ^ added at the beginning and $ added at the end, if they
<br>
are not specified. The special characters ^ matches the
beginning of the resouce, and $ matches the end of
resource.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(Note even if compiled with BSD
regular expressions, POSIX style syntax is used; also note
BSD regular expressions do not support ranges {}.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C By default resources are
canonicalized to lower case on minting and on checking. The
-C flag overrides this so that resources are treated as case
sensitive on checking, and <br>
not canonizalized on minting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P Print progress info (number
of iterations, expected iterations, percentage done, best
stamp size found so far).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O core <br>
Select hashcash core with that number. Currently 0-9 are
valid cores. Not all cores work on all architectures. Eg
some are x86 specific assembler, others PPC specific <br>
assembler. If a core is not valid hashcash returns failure
and explains what happened.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Z n <br>
Compress the stamp. This is a time vs space trade off.
Larger stamps are faster, but arguably slightly ugly. For
fastest stamps (the default) use -Z 0; for partly com&acirc;
<br>
pressed stamps use -Z 1; for very compressed, but somewhat
slow stamps use -Z 2. (Note: due to a late discovered bug,
-Z2 is the same as -Z1 for now until I can fix that.)</p>

stamp&rsquo;s creation time. This is the same fuzz factor
used by mixmaster to reduce risk of timing-correlations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examining Stamps</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;hashcash -w
1:24:040806:foo::511801694b4cd6b0:1e7297a&quot; <br>
Report the value of the stamp (how many bits of collision)
there are. The example is a 24 bit collision, which takes on
average 25 seconds to create on a 3Ghz P4.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;hashcash -mq -b 10 foo
&acirc;&ordf; hashcash -w&quot; <br>
Create a stamp in batch mode, pass to hashcash on stdin to
verify, have it print how many bits there were.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;hashcash -n
1:24:040806:foo::511801694b4cd6b0:1e7297a&quot; <br>
Report the resource name from the stamp. The resource name
in the example is foo.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;hashcash -l -e 30y
1:24:040806:foo::511801694b4cd6b0:1e7297a&quot; <br>
Report how long until the stamp expires if it expires in 30
years from its creation date. (Note dates too far into the
future run into the 2038 end of Epoch, which is the <br>
unix time analog of the y2k bug).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Verifying Stamps</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;hashcash -c
1:24:040806:foo::511801694b4cd6b0:1e7297a&quot; <br>
Check if the stamp is valid. Note as we are not checking the
stamp in a double spend database, and did not specify a
resource name or required number of bits of collision <br>
and hashcash will consider the stamp not fully checked, and
it will report it as valid but not fully unchecked, or as
invalid if there is any problem with the stamp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;hashcash -c -b24
1:24:040806:foo::511801694b4cd6b0:1e7297a&quot; <br>
Check that the value of the stamp is greater or equal to 24
bits. This example has 24 bit value. If you increase the
requested number of bits or replace the stamp with one <br>
with less than 24 bit collision the stamp will be
rejected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;hashcash -c -b24 -r foo
1:24:040806:foo::511801694b4cd6b0:1e7297a&quot; <br>
As above check if the stamp has sufficient value, but in
addition check that the resource name given matches the
resource name in the stamp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Double Spending Prevention</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The examples given in
&quot;Verifying Stamps&quot; can be modified to keep a
double spend database so that the same stamp will not be
accepted twice. Note a stamp will only be checked in <br>
and added to the database if it is otherwise valid and fully
checked (a required number of bits of collision has been
specified and a resource has been specified).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;hashcash -cd -b 10 -r foo
1:24:040806:foo::511801694b4cd6b0:1e7297a&quot; <br>
Check the stamp and add to double spent database if
it&rsquo;s valid (has correct resource name and sufficient
value).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;hashcash -cd -b 10 -r foo
1:24:040806:foo::511801694b4cd6b0:1e7297a&quot; <br>
Try to double spend the stamp. It will be rejected as double
spent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Stamp Expiry</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To prevent the double spend
database growing indefinately, the recipient can request
that stamps be no older than a specified period. After
expiry old stamps can dropped from <br>
the double spend database as they will no longer be needed
-- expired stamps can be rejected based purely on their old
date, so the space taken by expired stamps in the double
<br>
spend database can be saved without risk of accepting an
expired though otherwise valid stamp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The third field of the stamp is
the UTC time since 1st January 1970. The default time format
is YYMMDD, time rounded down to the nearest day. The default
validity period is 28 <br>
days.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can provide an alternative
validity period with the -e option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;hashcash -cd -b 10 -e 2d
-r foo 1:24:040806:foo::511801694b4cd6b0:1e7297a&quot; <br>
Try verifying an old stamp, the above stamp was created 11
Aug 2002.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">We gave option -e 2d so the
stamps expiry date is 2 days after creation, which is now in
the past.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: if the creation time is
expressed in the stamp in days, the precise creation date is
the begining of the specified day in UTC time (similarly for
alternate units the <br>
creation time is rounded down to the begining of the unit it
is expressed in). For units in days, for example, this may
mean depending on your time zone that the stamp <br>
appears to be considered invalid in under the specified
expiry period in days relative to your relative view of what
day it is, as the calculation is based on current time in
<br>
UTC, and the creation time of the stamp is expressed in UTC
time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;hashcash -cd -b 10 -r foo
1:24:040806:foo::511801694b4cd6b0:1e7297a&quot; <br>
Test whether the stamp is otherwise valid, apart from having
expired. Omitting the -e tells hashcash that the stamp will
never expire. An expiry period of forever can also <br>
be given explitly like this: -e 0, where an expiry period of
0 means forever.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Purging old stamps</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -c, -d options are used
together, each time a stamp is checked, if it is valid and
all of the mandatory aspects of the stamp are verified
(collision bits check, resource <br>
name check) then the stamp and its expiry period is written
to the database file. The default expiry period if an expiry
period is not given explicitly with the -e option is 28 <br>
days (ie stamps expire after 4 weeks).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">First mint and then add a
stamp:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;hashcash -m -b 10 foo -e
1m &gt; stamp&quot; <br>
Note: we specified an expiry on minting in this example, to
ensure that the stamp creation time is given in high enough
resolution in the stamp that the stamp will not be <br>
considered expired at time of creation. (Recall the default
resolution is in days, a stamp created with a creation time
rounded down to the beginging of the day is unlikely <br>
to be considered valid 1 minute later unless you mint it at
midnight UTC time.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;hashcash -cd -e 1m -b 10
-r foo &lt; stamp&quot; <br>
The stamp expires in 1 minute. Wait 1 minute and then
explicitly request that expired stamps be purged:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;hashcash -p now&quot; <br>
Then try resubmitting the same stamp:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;hashcash -cd -e 1m -b 10
-r foo &lt; stamp&quot; <br>
and the stamp will be rejected anyway as it has expired,
illustrating why it was not necessary to keep this stamp in
the database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With the default database (the
sdb format) the database contents are human readable, so you
can view their contents by cating them to the terminal:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;cat hashcash.sdb&quot;
<br>
to see that the stamp really is added and then after puring
subsequently purged due to expiry.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Purging old stamps on Demand</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As a convenience you can purge
at the same time as checking stamps by using the -p option
with the -c option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;hashcash -m -b 10 foo &gt;
stamp&quot; <br>
&quot;hashcash -cd -p now -e 1 -b 10 -r foo &lt; stamp&quot;
<br>
It may be inefficient to purge stamps on every use as the
entire database has to be scanned for expired stamps. By
giving a time period to the -p option, you can tell
&quot;hash&acirc; <br>
cash&quot; to purge no more frequently than that time period
since the previous purge.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;hashcash -cd -p 1d -e 1 -b
10 -r foo &lt; stamp&quot; <br>
tells &quot;hashcash&quot; to purge any expired stamps no
more than once per day.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;hashcash -p 1M -j
foo&quot; <br>
tells &quot;hashcash&quot; to purge only expired stamps
matching resource foo once per month.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;hashcash -p now -k&quot;
<br>
tells &quot;hashcash&quot; to purge all stamps (expired and
unexpired) now.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">stamp format (version 1) <br>
The current stamp format is version 1. This tool can verify
hashcash version 0 stamps also, but version 0 stamps are no
longer created as they are being phased out in favor of <br>
the more extensible v1 stamp format.</p>

has values 2 and 3; extension name2 has no values; extension

<br>
may interpret the values as it sees fit eg
