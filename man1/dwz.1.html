<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
dwz - DWARF optimization and duplicate removal tool</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
dwz [OPTION...] [FILES]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
dwz is a program that attempts to optimize DWARF debugging
information contained in ELF shared libraries and ELF
executables for size, by replacing DWARF information
representa&acirc; <br>
tion with equivalent smaller representation where possible
and by reducing the amount of duplication using techniques
from DWARF standard appendix E - creating DW_TAG_par&acirc;
<br>
tial_unit compilation units (CUs) for duplicated information
and using DW_TAG_imported_unit to import it into each CU
that needs it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The tool handles DWARF 32-bit
format debugging sections of versions 2, 3 and 4 and GNU
extensions on top of those, though using DWARF 4 or worst
case DWARF 3 is strongly recom&acirc; <br>
mended.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The tool has two main modes of
operation, without the -m option it attempts to optimize
DWARF debugging information in each given object (executable
or shared library) individu&acirc; <br>
ally, with the -m option it afterwards attempts to optimize
even more by moving DWARF debugging information entries
(DIEs), strings and macro descriptions duplicated in more
than <br>
one object into a newly created ELF ET_REL object whose
filename is given as -m option argument. The debug sections
in the executables and shared libraries specified on the
com&acirc; <br>
mand line are then modified again, referring to the entities
in the newly created object.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-m FILE --multifile FILE <br>
Multifile mode. After processing all named executables and
shared libraries, attempt to create ELF object FILE and put
debugging information duplicated in more than one <br>
object there, afterwards optimize each named executable or
shared library even further if possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h --hardlink <br>
Look for executables or shared libraries hardlinked
together, instead of rewriting them individually rewrite
just one of them and hardlink the rest to the first one
again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M NAME --multifile-name NAME
<br>
Specify the name of the common file that should be put into
the .gnu_debugaltlink section alongside with its build ID.
By default dwz puts there the argument of the -m <br>
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r --relative <br>
Specify that the name of the common file to be put into the
.gnu_debugaltlink section is supposed to be relative path
from the directory containing the executable or <br>
shared library to the file named in the argument of the -m
option. Either -M or -r option can be specified, but not
both.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q --quiet <br>
Silence up some of the most common messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o FILE --output FILE <br>
This option instructs dwz not to overwrite the specified
file, but instead store the new content into FILE. Nothing
is written if dwz exits with non-zero exit code. Can <br>
be used only with a single executable or shared library (if
there are no arguments at all, a.out is assumed).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l COUNT --low-mem-die-limit
COUNT <br>
Handle executables or shared libraries containing more than
COUNT debugging information entries in their .debug_info
section using a slower and more memory usage friendly <br>
mode and don&rsquo;t attempt to optimize that object in
multifile mode. The default is 10 million DIEs. There is a
risk that for very large amounts of debugging information in
<br>
a single shared library or executable there might not be
enough memory (especially when dwz tool is 32-bit binary, it
might run out of available virtual address space even <br>
sooner).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L COUNT --max-die-limit COUNT
<br>
Don&rsquo;t attempt to optimize executables or shared
libraries containing more than COUNT DIEs at all. The
default is 50 million DIEs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-? --help <br>
Print short help and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v --version <br>
Print version number and short licensing notice and
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ARGUMENTS <br>
Command-line arguments should be the executables, shared
libraries or their stripped to file separate debug
information objects.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
$ dwz -m .dwz/foobar-1.2.debug -rh bin/foo.debug
bin/foo2.debug foo/lib/libbar.so.debug <br>
will attempt to optimize debugging information in
bin/foo.debug, bin/foo2.debug and lib/libbar.so.debug (by
modifying the files in place) and when beneficial also will
create <br>
.dwz/foobar-1.2.debug file. .gnu_debugaltlink section in the
first two files will refer to ../.dwz/foobar-1.2.debug and
in the last file to ../../.dwz/foobar-1.2.debug. If e.g.
<br>
bin/foo.debug and bin/foo2.debug were hardlinked together
initially, they will be hardlinked again and for multifile
optimizations considered just as a single file rather than
<br>
two. <br>
$ dwz -o foo.dwz foo <br>
will not modify foo but instead store the ELF object with
optimized debugging information if successful into foo.dwz
file it creates. <br>
$ dwz *.debug foo/*.debug <br>
will attempt to optimize debugging information in *.debug
and foo/*.debug files, optimizing each file individually in
place. <br>
$ dwz <br>
is equivalent to dwz a.out command.</p>
