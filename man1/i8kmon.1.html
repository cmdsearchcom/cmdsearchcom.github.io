<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
I8kmon - Monitor the cpu temperature and fan status on Dell
laptops</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNTAX <br>
i8kmon [&lt;options&gt;]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The i8kmon daemon can be used to monitor the cpu temperature
and fan status on Dell laptops. The program can be run in
background as daemon or under X as an applet which can be
<br>
swallowed in the gnome panel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default the program monitors
the cpu temperature but doesn&rsquo;t do any automatic
controls of the fan status accordingly to user-defined
temperature thresholds because this may <br>
not be needed if your laptop does already a good job with
fans control. The automatic control can be enabled manually
with the --auto option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The automatic fan control can
also be turned on in the control popup menu which is invoked
by clicking with the left mouse button on the temperature
label. The control menu has <br>
three items: Auto, which controls the automatic fan control,
Verbose, which prints status on stdout, and Suspend, which
closes the /proc/i8kfan file and suspends the daemon to <br>
allow unloading the kernel module.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The user interface reports the
current cpu temperature in the top box and in the two lower
buttons the status of the fans. On systems wiht only one fan
the interface shows only <br>
one fan button. If a button&rsquo;s background becomes red
it means that the corresponding fan has a rotation speed
lower than the minimum expected speed and is probably stuck.
In <br>
this case proding it with a bent paper clip can often cause
it to become unstuck.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The fan buttons can also be used
to manually control the fan speeds. Clicking on a fan button
with the left mouse button will cycle the selected fan
between low speed, high <br>
speed and off. Clicking with the middle button will set the
fan to high speed and clicking with the right button will
switch the fan off. Note however that both the BIOS and <br>
the daemon have their own idea of what the fan speed should
be and can sometimes try to override the manual
settings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The program accepts the following command-line options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a, --auto <br>
Monitor cpu temperature and fan status and control
automatically the fans.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-na, --noauto <br>
Monitor cpu temperature and fan status but don&rsquo;t
control automatically the fans. This is the default
setting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --daemon <br>
Run the program in daemon mode, i.e. without the user
interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nd, --nodaemon <br>
Don&rsquo;t run the program in daemon mode, i.e. open the
user interface. This is the default setting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nc, --nouserconfig <br>
Don&rsquo;t attempt to source the ~/.i8kmon configfile, only
/etc/i8kmon.conf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
Report hardware status and program actions on stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g, --geometry &lt;geometry&gt;
<br>
Specifies the geometry of the applet window. Geometry should
be 24x24, 36x36 or 48x48 to fit the size of the gnome
panel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t, --timeout &lt;seconds&gt;
<br>
Specifies the interval at which the daemon checks the
hardware status. Useful values are in the range of 1-5
seconds. Default is 2 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u, --unit C|F <br>
Specifies the temperature display unit. Default is C
(Celsius). This option affects only the value shown in the
applet. All other temperature values are always in
Cel&acirc; <br>
sius.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION <br>
The program has builtin defaults and temperature thresholds
but users can specify their own settings in configuration
files /etc/default/i8kmon and ~/.i8kmon. The daemon defines
<br>
4 states with different fan speeds ({0 0}, {1 0}, {1 1}, {2
2}) and for each state are defined the temperature
thresholds which cause the switching to a higher or lower
state. <br>
Furthermore each state can have different thresholds for
operation on ac power or battery. For example the following
configuration:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set config(0) {{0 0}
&quot;-&quot;1 60 &quot;-&quot;1 65} <br>
set config(1) {{1 0} 50 70 55 75} <br>
set config(2) {{1 1} 60 80 65 85} <br>
set config(3) {{2 2} 70 128 75 128}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">defines state 0 with both fans
off, high threshold of 60 degrees (65 on battery) and low
threshold &quot;-&quot;1, which is actually never reached
since 0 is the lowest state. When the <br>
high threshold is reached the program switches to state 1
(left low, right off) which has a high threshold of 70
degrees and a low threshold of 50 degrees. If the
temperature <br>
drops below 50 the program will switch back to state 0, if
it rises above 70 it will enter state 2, and so on. For
better operation the temperature ranges should be
overlapping <br>
with an hysteresis of at least 10 degrees, i.e. 1={50
70},2={60 80} is better than 1={50 70},2={70 80}. It must be
rembered that the low threshold of state 0 must be
&quot;-&quot;1 and the <br>
high threshold of state 3 must be 128.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If your laptop has only one fan
you should specify a &rsquo;-&rsquo; instead of the fan
speed of the missing fan, for example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set config(2) {{1 -} 60 80 65
85}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This program can be used by
normal users as Gnome panel applet or started as daemon by
an init script. Under Debian GNU/Linux it is possible to
start the daemon automatically by <br>
creating an /etc/default/i8kmon configfile containing the
line &quot;set config(daemon) 1&quot;. Note the the
/etc/default/i8kmon configfile is not installed by the
i8kutils package <br>
because the program is designed to be run by normal users.
If you want to use it as daemon you must create the config
file yourself. In this case, the --nouserconfig option can
<br>
sometimes also help by limiting it to sourcing
/etc/i8kmon.conf (and not ~/.i8kmon).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
On some Linux distributions i8kmon exits with an error like
this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">can&rsquo;t find package Tk <br>
while executing <br>
&quot;package require Tk&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is not a bug of i8kmon. It
means that Tcl/Tk files are not installed correctly on your
system and the Tk library can&rsquo;t be dynamically loaded
from Tcl as it should be. In <br>
this case you can run i8kmon with the command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wish /usr/bin/i8kmon --
[options...]</p>
