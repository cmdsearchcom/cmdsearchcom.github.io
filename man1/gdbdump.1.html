<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
gdbdump - dump HP 100LX database into ASCII format</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
gdbdump [-noqswm] file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
gdbdump exports the contents of an HP 100LX database into an
ASCII form. file is the name of the 100LX database to read;
the results are written to the terminal and can be
redi&acirc; <br>
rected or piped as needed. The output format is suitable for
input to many database packages as well as to
gdbload(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options <br>
gdbdump recognizes the following options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Suppress the first line of
the output, which normally contains the names of all of the
database fields. Note that if this option is specified, the
output is not <br>
compatible with gdbload(1). However, this option may be
needed for compatibility with other database programs trying
to read the output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o Omit note fields from the
output. Note fields are included by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Suppress warning
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Write special characters
(character codes 128-254, inclusive) directly to the output.
The default is to represent such characters in 0n
notation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w Wrap long lines. For some
databases, the output line length can be larger than some
programs (notably vi(1)) can handle, especially if records
contain long notes. <br>
This option wraps each output line at about 75 characters,
marking the end of lines to be continued with a backslash (.
gdbload(1) understands this format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m Write multi-line string (i.e.
note) fields on multiple lines. Thus the quoted string will
span newlines. Without this option, newlines in strings will
be output as <br>
sequences, and the complete string will be subject to line
wrapping if specified by the -w option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Output Format Description <br>
The output of this program is an ASCII text file which
starts with a line containing field names (unless -n was
specified) and is followed by one line for each record of
the <br>
database. Note that any of these lines may be split into
multiple lines if -w is specified, and that newlines in
strings may cause further splitting if specified by the -m
<br>
option. Each &quot;logical&quot; line contains all of the
fields of the database, in the same order in which their
field names appeared on the first line of the output. The
fields are <br>
separated by commas.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Exactly how each field appears
in the output depends on its type. Text fields, category
fields, and note fields appear with the contents inside
quote marks (&quot;). Quote marks and <br>
backslashes within the text of the field are escaped by
preceding them with a backslash (. Newlines are printed as
and, unless the -m option is used. carriage returns as <br>
Non-printing or non-ASCII characters as 0n, where nnn is an
octal character code. (See the description of the -s flag,
above.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Number fields appear as they do
in the database. Date fields appear in the format YYYYMMDD;
for example, August 15, 1993 would appear as 19930815. Time
fields appear in the <br>
format HHMM, where HH is in the range 00-23.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Radio buttons and check boxes
appear as 1 if selected, 0 otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All other field types, including
application-defined types, are omitted from the output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This output format can be used
as input to gdbload(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WARNINGS <br>
gdbdump cannot handle the application-defined records and
fields in HP 100LX Appointment Book and World Time
databases. Running this program on such databases will give
useful, <br>
but incomplete, output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Records are printed in the order
stored in the file, i.e., randomly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This program cannot handle
password-protected databases. Attempts to dump
password-protected databases will have unpredictable
results.</p>
