gdbdump - dump HP 100LX database into ASCII format
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<b>gdbdump</b> [<b>-noqswm</b>] <i>file</i>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>gdbdump</b> exports the contents of an HP 100LX database into an ASCII form.
  <i>file</i> is the name of the 100LX database to read; the results are written
  to the terminal and can be redirected or piped as needed. The output format is
  suitable for input to many database packages as well as to <i>gdbload</i>(1).
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Options"><a class="selflink" href="#Options">Options</a></h2>
<b>gdbdump</b> recognizes the following options:
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-n</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Suppress the first line of the output, which normally
      contains the names of all of the database fields. Note that if this option
      is specified, the output is not compatible with <i>gdbload</i>(1).
      However, this option may be needed for compatibility with other database
      programs trying to read the output.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-o</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Omit note fields from the output. Note fields are included
      by default.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-q</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Suppress warning messages.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-s</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Write special characters (character codes 128-254,
      inclusive) directly to the output. The default is to represent such
      characters in \nnn notation.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-w</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Wrap long lines. For some databases, the output line length
      can be larger than some programs (notably <i>vi</i>(1)) can handle,
      especially if records contain long notes. This option wraps each output
      line at about 75 characters, marking the end of lines to be continued with
      a backslash (\). <i>gdbload</i>(1) understands this format.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-m</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Write multi-line string (i.e. note) fields on multiple
      lines. Thus the quoted string will span newlines. Without this option,
      newlines in strings will be output as \r\n sequences, and the complete
      string will be subject to line wrapping if specified by the <b>-w</b>
      option.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Output_Format_Description"><a class="selflink" href="#Output_Format_Description">Output
  Format Description</a></h2>
The output of this program is an ASCII text file which starts with a line
  containing field names (unless <b>-n</b> was specified) and is followed by one
  line for each record of the database. Note that any of these lines may be
  split into multiple lines if <b>-w</b> is specified, and that newlines in
  strings may cause further splitting if specified by the <b>-m</b> option. Each
  &quot;logical&quot; line contains all of the fields of the database, in the
  same order in which their field names appeared on the first line of the
  output. The fields are separated by commas.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Exactly how each field appears in the output depends on its type. Text fields,
  category fields, and note fields appear with the contents inside quote marks
  (&quot;). Quote marks and backslashes within the text of the field are escaped
  by preceding them with a backslash (\). Newlines are printed as \n and
  carriage returns as \r, unless the <b>-m</b> option is used. Non-printing or
  non-ASCII characters as \nnn, where nnn is an octal character code. (See the
  description of the <b>-s</b> flag, above.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
Number fields appear as they do in the database. Date fields appear in the
  format YYYYMMDD; for example, August 15, 1993 would appear as 19930815. Time
  fields appear in the format HHMM, where HH is in the range 00-23.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Radio buttons and check boxes appear as 1 if selected, 0 otherwise.
<div class="Pp"></div>
All other field types, including application-defined types, are omitted from the
  output.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This output format can be used as input to <i>gdbload</i>(1).
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="WARNINGS"><a class="selflink" href="#WARNINGS">WARNINGS</a></h1>
<b>gdbdump</b> cannot handle the application-defined records and fields in HP
  100LX Appointment Book and World Time databases. Running this program on such
  databases will give useful, but incomplete, output.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Records are printed in the order stored in the file, i.e., randomly.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This program cannot handle password-protected databases. Attempts to dump
  password-protected databases will have unpredictable results.
