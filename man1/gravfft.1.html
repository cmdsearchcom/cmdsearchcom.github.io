<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
gravfft - Compute gravitational attraction of 3-D surfaces
in the wavenumber (or frequency) domain</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: No space is allowed
between the option flag and the associated arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
gravfft can be used into three main modes. Mode 1: Simply
compute the geopotential due to the surface given in the
topo.grd file. Requires a density contrast (-D) and possibly
a <br>
different observation level (-W). It will take the 2-D
forward FFT of the grid and use the full Parker&acirc;s
method up to the chosen terms. Mode 2: Compute the
geopotential <br>
response due to flexure of the topography file. It will take
the 2-D forward FFT of the grid and use the full
Parker&acirc;s method applied to the chosen isostatic model.
The avail&acirc; <br>
able models are the &acirc;loading from top&acirc;, or
elastic plate model, and the &acirc;loading from
below&acirc; which accounts for the plate&acirc;s response
to a sub-surface load (appropriate for hot <br>
spot modeling - if you believe them). In both cases, the
model parameters are set with -T and -Z options. Mode 3:
compute the admittance or coherence between two grids. The
out&acirc; <br>
put is the average in the radial direction. Optionally, the
model admittance may also be calculated. The horizontal
dimensions of the grdfiles are assumed to be in meters.
Geo&acirc; <br>
graphical grids may be used by specifying the -fg option
that scales degrees to meters. If you have grids with
dimensions in km, you could change this to meters using
grdedit or <br>
scale the output with grdmath. Given the number of choices
this program offers, is difficult to state what are options
and what are required arguments. It depends on what you <br>
are doing; see the examples for further guidance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REQUIRED ARGUMENTS <br>
ingrid 2-D binary grid file to be operated on. (See GRID
FILE FORMATS below). For cross-spectral operations, also
give the second grid file ingrd2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Goutfile <br>
Specify the name of the output grid file or the 1-D spectrum
table (see -E). (See GRID FILE FORMATS below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS <br>
-Cn/wavelength/mean_depth/tbw <br>
Compute only the theoretical admittance curves of the
selected model and exit. n and wavelength are used to
compute (n * wavelength) the total profile length in meters.
<br>
mean_depth is the mean water depth. Append dataflags (one or
two) of tbw in any order. t = use &acirc;from top&acirc;
model, b = use &acirc;from below&acirc; model. Optionally
specify w to write <br>
wavelength instead of frequency.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Ddensity|rhogrid <br>
Sets density contrast across surface. Used, for example, to
compute the gravity attraction of the water layer that can
later be combined with the free-air anomaly to get <br>
the Bouguer anomaly. In this case do not use -T. It also
implicitly sets -N+h. Alternatively, specify a co-registered
grid with density contrasts if a variable density <br>
contrast is required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-En_terms <br>
Number of terms used in Parker expansion (limit is 10,
otherwise terms depending on n will blow out the program)
[Default = 3]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F[f[+]|g|v|n|e] <br>
Specify desired geopotential field: compute geoid rather
than gravity <br>
f = Free-air anomalies (mGal) [Default]. Append + to add in
the slab implied when removing the mean value from the
topography. This requires zero topography to mean <br>
no mass anomaly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">g = Geoid anomalies (m).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">v = Vertical Gravity Gradient
(VGG; 1 Eotvos = 0.1 mGal/km).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">e = East deflections of the
vertical (micro-radian).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">n = North deflections of the
vertical (micro-radian).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Iw|b|c|t |k <br>
Use ingrd2 and ingrd1 (a grid with topography/bathymetry) to
estimate admittance|coherence and write it to stdout (-G
ignored if set). This grid should contain gravity or <br>
geoid for the same region of ingrd1. Default computes
admittance. Output contains 3 or 4 columns. Frequency
(wavelength), admittance (coherence) one sigma error bar
and, <br>
optionally, a theoretical admittance. Append dataflags (one
to three) from w|b|c|t. w writes wavelength instead of
wavenumber, k selects km for wavelength unit [m], c <br>
computes coherence instead of admittance, b writes a fourth
column with &acirc;loading from below&acirc; theoretical
admittance, and t writes a fourth column with &acirc;elastic
plate&acirc; the&acirc; <br>
oretical admittance.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N[a|f|m|r|s|nx/ny][+a|[+d|h|l][+e|n|m][+twidth][+v][+w[suffix]][+z[p]]
<br>
Choose or inquire about suitable grid dimensions for FFT and
set optional parameters. Control the FFT dimension: <br>
-Na lets the FFT select dimensions yielding the most
accurate result.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Nf will force the FFT to use
the actual dimensions of the data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Nm lets the FFT select
dimensions using the least work memory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Nr lets the FFT select
dimensions yielding the most rapid calculation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Ns will present a list of
optional dimensions, then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Nnx/ny will do FFT on array
size nx/ny (must be &gt;= grid file size). Default chooses
dimensions &gt;= data which optimize speed and accuracy of
FFT. If FFT dimensions &gt; <br>
grid file dimensions, data are extended and tapered to
zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Control detrending of data:
Append modifiers for removing a linear trend: <br>
+d: Detrend data, i.e. remove best-fitting linear trend
[Default].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+a: Only remove mean value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+h: Only remove mid value, i.e.
0.5 * (max + min).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+l: Leave data alone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Control extension and tapering
of data: Use modifiers to control how the extension and
tapering are to be performed: <br>
+e extends the grid by imposing edge-point symmetry
[Default],</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+m extends the grid by imposing
edge mirror symmetry</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+n turns off data extension.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tapering is performed from the
data edge to the FFT grid edge [100%]. Change this
percentage via +twidth. When +n is in effect, the tapering
is applied instead to the <br>
data margins as no extension is available [0%].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Control messages being reported:
+v will report suitable dimensions during processing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Control writing of temporary
results: For detailed investigation you can write the
intermediate grid being passed to the forward FFT; this is
likely to have been <br>
detrended, extended by point-symmetry along all edges, and
tapered. Append +w[suffix] from which output file name(s)
will be created (i.e., ingrid_prefix.ext) [tapered], <br>
where ext is your file extension. Finally, you may save the
complex grid produced by the forward FFT by appending +z. By
default we write the real and imaginary components <br>
to ingrid_real.ext and ingrid_imag.ext. Append p to save
instead the polar form of magnitude and phase to files
ingrid_mag.ext and ingrid_phase.ext.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Q Writes out a grid with the
flexural topography (with z positive up) whose average depth
was set by -Zzm and model parameters by -T (and output by
-G). That is the &acirc;gravi&acirc; <br>
metric Moho&acirc;. -Q implicitly sets -N+h</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S Computes predicted gravity or
geoid grid due to a subplate load produced by the current
bathymetry and the theoretical model. The necessary
parameters are set within -T <br>
and -Z options. The number of powers in Parker expansion is
restricted to 1. See an example further down.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Tte/rl/rm/rw[/ri][+m] <br>
Compute the isostatic compensation from the topography load
(input grid file) on an elastic plate of thickness te. Also
append densities for load, mantle, water and infill <br>
in SI units. If ri is not provided it defaults to rl. Give
average mantle depth via -Z. If the elastic thickness is
&gt; 1e10 it will be interpreted as the flexural rigidity
<br>
(by default it is computed from te and Young modulus).
Optionally, append +m to write a grid with the Moho&acirc;s
geopotential effect (see -F) from model selected by -T. If
te <br>
= 0 then the Airy response is returned. -T+m implicitly sets
-N+h</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wwd Set water depth (or
observation height) relative to topography [0]. Append k to
indicate km.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Zzm[zl] <br>
Moho [and swell] average compensation depths (in meters
positive dows &acirc; the depth). For the &acirc;load from
top&acirc; model you only have to provide zm, but for the
&acirc;loading from <br>
below&acirc; don&acirc;t forget zl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V[level] (more &acirc;&brvbar;)
<br>
Select verbosity level [c].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fg Geographic grids (dimensions
of longitude, latitude) will be converted to meters via a
&acirc;Flat Earth&acirc; approximation using the current
ellipsoid parameters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-^ or just - <br>
Print a short message about the syntax of the command, then
exits (NOTE: on Windows just use -).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-+ or just + <br>
Print an extensive usage (help) message, including the
explanation of any module-specific option (but not the GMT
common options), then exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-? or no arguments <br>
Print a complete usage (help) message, including the
explanation of all options, then exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GRID FILE FORMATS <br>
By default GMT writes out grid as single precision floats in
a COARDS-complaint netCDF file format. However, GMT is able
to produce grid files in many other commonly used grid <br>
file formats and also facilitates so called
&acirc;packing&acirc; of grids, writing out floating point
data as 1- or 2-byte integers. (more &acirc;&brvbar;)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GRID DISTANCE UNITS <br>
If the grid does not have meter as the horizontal unit,
append +uunit to the input file name to convert from the
specified unit to meter. If your grid is geographic, convert
<br>
distances to meters by supplying -fg instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONSIDERATIONS <br>
netCDF COARDS grids will automatically be recognized as
geographic. For other grids geographical grids were you want
to convert degrees into meters, select -fg. If the data are
<br>
close to either pole, you should consider projecting the
grid file onto a rectangular coordinate system using
grdproject.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PLATE FLEXURE <br>
The FFT solution to elastic plate flexure requires the
infill density to equal the load density. This is typically
only true directly beneath the load; beyond the load the
<br>
infill tends to be lower-density sediments or even water (or
air). Wessel [2001] proposed an approximation that allows
for the specification of an infill density different from
<br>
the load density while still allowing for an FFT solution.
Basically, the plate flexure is solved for using the infill
density as the effective load density but the amplitudes
<br>
are adjusted by a factor A = sqrt ((rm - ri)/(rm - rl)),
which is the theoretical difference in amplitude due to a
point load using the two different load densities. The
approx&acirc; <br>
imation is very good but breaks down for large loads on weak
plates, a fairy uncommon situation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
To compute the effect of the water layer above the bat.grd
bathymetry using 2700 and 1035 for the densities of crust
and water and writing the result on water_g.grd (computing
up <br>
to the fourth power of bathymetry in Parker expansion):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gmt gravfft bat.grd -D1665
-Gwater_g.grd -E4</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Now subtract it from your
free-air anomaly faa.grd and you will get the Bouguer
anomaly. You may wonder why we are subtracting and not
adding. After all the Bouguer anomaly pre&acirc; <br>
tends to correct the mass deficiency presented by the water
layer, so we should add because water is less dense than the
rocks below. The answer relies on the way gravity effects
<br>
are computed by the Parker&acirc;s method and practical
aspects of using the FFT.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gmt grdmath faa.grd water_g.grd
SUB = bouguer.grd</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Want an MBA anomaly? Well
compute the crust mantle contribution and add it to the
sea-bottom anomaly. Assuming a 6 km thick crust of density
2700 and a mantle with 3300 density <br>
we could repeat the command used to compute the water layer
anomaly, using 600 (3300 - 2700) as the density contrast.
But we now have a problem because we need to know the mean
<br>
Moho depth. That is when the scale/offset that can be
appended to the grid&acirc;s name comes in hand. Notice that
we didn&acirc;t need to do that before because mean water
depth was com&acirc; <br>
puted directly from data (notice also the negative sign of
the offset due to the fact that z is positive up):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gmt gravfft bat.grd=nf/1/-6000
-D600 -Gmoho_g.grd</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Now, subtract it from the
Bouguer to obtain the MBA anomaly. That is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gmt grdmath bouguer.grd
moho_g.grd SUB = mba.grd</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To compute the Moho gravity
effect of an elastic plate bat.grd with Te = 7 km, density
of 2700, over a mantle of density 3300, at an average depth
of 9 km</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gmt gravfft bat.grd
-Gelastic.grd -T7000/2700/3300/1035+m -Z9000</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you add now the sea-bottom
and Moho&acirc;s effects, you will get the full gravity
response of your isostatic model. We will use here only the
first term in Parker expansion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gmt gravfft bat.grd -D1665
-Gwater_g.grd -E1 <br>
gmt gravfft bat.grd -Gelastic.grd -T7000/2700/3300/1035+m
-Z9000 -E1 <br>
gmt grdmath water_g.grd elastic.grd ADD = model.grd</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The same result can be obtained
directly by the next command. However, PAY ATTENTION to the
following. I don&acirc;t yet know if it&acirc;s because of a
bug or due to some limitation, but <br>
the fact is that the following and the previous commands
only give the same result if -E1 is used. For higher powers
of bathymetry in Parker expansion, only the above example
<br>
seams to give the correct result.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gmt gravfft bat.grd -Gmodel.grd
-T7000/2700/3300/1035 -Z9000 -E1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">And what would be the geoid
anomaly produced by a load at 50 km depth, below a region
whose bathymetry is given by bat.grd, a Moho at 9 km depth
and the same densities as before?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To compute the admittance
between the topo.grd bathymetry and faa.grd free-air anomaly
grid using the elastic plate model of a crust of 6 km mean
