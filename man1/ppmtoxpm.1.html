<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ppmtoxpm - convert a PPM image to an X11 pixmap</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ppmtoxpm [-name=xpmname] [-hexonly] [-rgb=rgb-textfile]
[-alphamask=pgmfile] [ppmfile]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Minimum unique abbreviation of
option is acceptable. You may use double hyphens instead of
single hyphen to denote options. You may use white space in
place of the equals sign <br>
to separate an option name from its value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This program is part of Netpbm(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ppmtoxpm reads a PPM image as
input and produces X11 pixmap (version 3) as output. This
format can be loaded by the XPM library.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the XPM output, colors may be
identified by name, such as &quot;Red&quot;, or in
hexadecimal, for example &quot;#FF0000&quot;. In the
hexadecimal format, there may be from 1 through 4
hexadeci&acirc; <br>
mal digits per RGB component.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, ppmtoxpbm tries to
find a name for each color in the image in the system color
dictionary &acirc;&uml;libppm.html#rgb.txt&acirc;&copy; ,
and if it finds one, uses it. If it doesn&rsquo;t it uses
<br>
hexadecimal. You can force ppmtoxpbm to use hexadecimal only
with the -hexonly option. You can specify a different color
dictionary with the -rgb option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When ppmtoxpm uses the
hexadecimal format for identifying a color, it uses the one
that uses the least number of hexadecimal digits that it
takes to represent the maxval of the <br>
input PPM. E.g. if the maxval of the input PPM is 100,
ppmtoxpm uses 2 digits per component, as in
&quot;#FF0000&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some programs do not properly
handle one-digit-per-component hexadecimal color specifiers.
They see the wrong colors. To produce an XPM that such a
program can handle, make <br>
sure the maxval of the input PPM is greater than 15, such as
by running it through pamdepth 255.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Color Code Lengths - Image Size
<br>
In the XPM format, there is a palette (&rsquo;color
map&rsquo;) that assigns each color in the image to a unique
sequence of printable characters called a color code, and a
raster that iden&acirc; <br>
tifies the color of each pixel of the image with one of
those color codes. The length of the color code affects the
size of the image stream.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All color codes in an image are
the same length, and ppmtoxpm tries to make it as short as
possible. That length is, of course, determined by the
number of colors in the image. <br>
ppmtoxpm counts the colors in the image, excluding those
that will be transparent in the output due to your alpha
mask, and chooses a color code length accordingly. There are
92 <br>
printable characters that can be used in a color code.
Therefore, if you have 92 or fewer colors, your color codes
will be one character. If you have more than 92 but not more
<br>
than 92 * 92, your color codes will be two characters. And
so on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There&rsquo;s one exception to
the above: If you specify an alpha mask (the -alpha option,
one unique color code represents &rsquo;transparent.&rsquo;
This is true even if the alpha mask doesn&rsquo;t <br>
actually produce any transparent pixels. So subtract one
from the number of possible colors if you use -alpha.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-name=xpmname <br>
This option specifies the prefix string which is specified
in the resulting XPM output. If you don&rsquo;t use the
-name otpion, ppmtoxpm defaults to the filename (without
<br>
extension) of the ppmfile parameter. If you do not specify
-name or ppmfile (i.e. your input is from Standard Input),
the prefix string defaults to the string noname.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-hexonly <br>
This option says never to put color names in the XPM file,
but rather to identify names by hexadecimal strings that
explicitly identify RGB component intensities. This <br>
means the reader of the file need not have access to a
suitable color dictionary to interpret it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option was introduced in
Netpbm 10.15 (April 2003). Before that, it was the default,
overridden by specifying -rgb.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-rgb=rgb-textfile <br>
This option names the file in which the color dictionary you
want to use resides. By default, ppmtoxpm uses the system
color dictionary
&acirc;&uml;libppm.html#rgb.txt&acirc;&copy; .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option in meaningless when
you specify -hexonly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Before Netpbm 10.15 (April
2003), ppmtoxpm did not default to the system color
dictionary. If you didn&rsquo;t specify -rgb, ppmtoxpbm
would use only hexadecimal color speci&acirc; <br>
fiers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-alphamask=pgmfile <br>
This option names a PGM file to use as an alpha
(transparency) mask. The file must contain an image the same
dimensions as the input image. ppmtoxpm marks as
transpar&acirc; <br>
ent any pixel whose position in the alpha mask image is at
most half white.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you don&rsquo;t specify
-alphamask, ppmtoxpm makes all pixels in the output
opaque.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ppmcolormask is one way to
generate an alpha mask file. You might also generate it by
extracting transparency information from an XPM file with
the -alphaout option to <br>
xpmtoppm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are similar options on
other Netpbm converters that convert from formats that
include transparency information too.</p>
