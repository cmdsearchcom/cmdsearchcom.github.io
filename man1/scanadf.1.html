<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
scanadf - acquire multiple images from a scanner equipped
with an ADF</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
scanadf [-d|--device-name dev] [-h|--help]
[-L|--list-devices] [-v|--verbose] [-V|--version]
[-o|--output-file name] [-N|--no-overwrite]
[-S|--scan-script name] [--script-wait] <br>
[-s|--start-count num] [-e|--end-count num] [-r|--raw]
[device-specific-options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
scanadf is a command-line interface to control image
acquisition devices which are capable of returning a series
of images (e.g. a scanner with an automatic document feeder
<br>
(ADF)). The device is controlled via command-line options.
After command-line processing, scanadf normally proceeds to
acquire a series of images until the device returns the <br>
SANE_STATUS_NO_DOCS status code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The images are written to output
files, specified by the --output-file option. These files
are typically written in one of the PNM (portable aNyMaP)
formats (PBM for black-and- <br>
white images, PGM for grayscale images, and PPM for color
images). Several optional frame formats (SANE_FRAME_JPEG,
SANE_FRAME_G31D, SANE_FRAME_G32D, SANE_FRAME_G42D, and <br>
SANE_FRAME_TEXT) are supported. In each case, the data is
written out to the output file as-is without a header.
Unrecognized frame formats are handled in the same way, <br>
although a warning message is printed in verbose mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Typically, the optional frame
formats are used in conjunction with a scan script
(specified by the --scanscript option) which is invoked for
each acquired image. The script is <br>
provided with a series of environment variables which
describe the parameters and format of the image file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">scanadf accesses image
acquisition devices through the SANE (Scanner Access Now
Easy) interface and can thus support any device for which
there exists a SANE backend (try &quot;apro&acirc; <br>
pos sane-&quot; to get a list of available backends).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The -d or --device-name options must be followed by a SANE
device-name. A (partial) list of available devices can be
obtained with the --list-devices option (see below). If no
<br>
device-name is specified explicitly, scanadf will attempt to
open the first available device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -h or --help options request
help information. The information is printed on standard
output and in this case, no attempt will be made to acquire
an image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -L or --list-devices option
requests a (partial) list of devices that are available. The
list is not complete since some devices may be available,
but are not listed in any <br>
of the configuration files (which are typically stored in
directory /etc/sane.d). This is particularly the case when
accessing scanners through the network. If a device is not
<br>
listed in a configuration file, the only way to access it is
by its full device name. You may need to consult your system
administrator to find out the names of such devices.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -v or --verbose options
increase the verbosity of the operation of scanadf. The
option may be specified repeatedly, each time increasing the
verbosity level.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -V or --version option
requests that scanadf print the program and package name, as
well as the version number of the SANE distribution that it
came with.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -o or --output-file option
specifies a format string used to generate the name of file
to write the image data to. You can use %d replacement in
the output file name; this <br>
will be replaced with the current page number. The default
format string is image-%04d.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -N or --no-overwrite option
prevents scanadf from overwriting existing image files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -S or --scan-script option
specifies the name of script to run after each scanned image
is acquired. The script receives the name of the image
output file as its first and <br>
only command line argument. Additionally the scan script can
reference the following environment variables to get
information about the parameters of the image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SCAN_RES - the image resolution
(in DPI) <br>
SCAN_WIDTH - the image width (in pixels) <br>
SCAN_HEIGHT - the image height (in pixels) <br>
SCAN_DEPTH - the image bit-depth (in bits) <br>
SCAN_FORMAT - a string representing the image format (e.g.
gray, g42d, text, etc) <br>
SCAN_FORMAT_ID - the numeric image format identifier</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the --scipt-wait option is
given, scanadf will wait until all scan-scripts have been
finished before exiting. That will be useful if scanadf is
used in conjunction with tools <br>
to modify the scanned images.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -s or --start-count option
specifies the page number of first scanned image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -e or --end-count option
specifies the last page number to scan. Using this option,
you can request a specific number of pages to be scanned,
rather than scanning until <br>
there are no more images available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -r or --raw option specifies
that the raw image data be written to the output file as-is
without interpretation. This disables the writing of the PNM
header for basic frame <br>
types. This feature is usually used in conjunction with the
--scan-script option where the scan script uses the
environment variables to understand the format and
parameters of <br>
the image and converts the file to a more useful format.
NOTE: With support for the optional frame types and the
default handling of unrecognized frametypes, this option
becomes <br>
less and less useful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As you might imagine, much of
the power of scanadf comes from the fact that it can control
any SANE backend. Thus, the exact set of command-line
options depends on the capabili&acirc; <br>
ties of the selected device. To see the options for a device
named dev, invoke scanadf via a command-line of the
form:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">scanadf --help --device dev</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The documentation for the
device-specific options printed by --help is explained in
the manual page for scanimage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHOR <br>
scanadf is an adaptation by Tom Martone of scanimage by
David Mosberger, Andreas Beck, and Gordon Matzigkeit
following closely the features of bnhscan by Sean
Reifschneider of <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Please send reports to
sane-devel@lists.alioth.debian.org.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This program relies on the
backend to return the SANE_STATUS_NO_DOCS status code when
the automatic document feeder is out of paper. Use of this
program with backends that do <br>
not support ADFs (e.g. flatbed scanners) will likely result
in repeated scans of the same document. In this case, it is
essential to use the start-count and end-count to control
<br>
the number of images acquired.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Only a subset of the SANE
backends support feeders and return SANE_STATUS_NO_DOCS
appropriately. Backends which are known to work at this time
are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sane-bh - Bell+Howell Copiscan
II series scanners. <br>
sane-hp - Hewlett Packard scanners. A patch to the sane-hp
backend is necessary. The --scantype=ADF option must be
specified (earlier versions of the backend used the <br>
--scan-from-adf option, instead). <br>
sane-umax - UMAX scanners. Support exists in build 12 and
later. The --source=&quot;Automatic Document Feeder&quot;
option must be specified.</p>
