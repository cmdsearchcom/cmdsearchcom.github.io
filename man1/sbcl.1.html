<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
SBCL -- Steel Bank Common Lisp</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
SBCL is an implementation of ANSI Common Lisp, featuring a
high-performance native compiler, native threads on several
platforms, a socket interface, a source-level debugger, a
<br>
statistical profiler, and much more.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is free software, mostly in
the public domain, but with some subsystems under BSD-style
licenses which allow modification and reuse as long as
credit is given. It is provided <br>
&quot;as is&quot;, with no warranty of any kind.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For more information about
license issues, see the COPYING file in the distribution.
For more information about history, see the CREDITS file in
the distribution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RUNNING SBCL <br>
To run SBCL, type &quot;sbcl&quot;. After startup messages a
prompt (&quot;*&quot;) appears. Enter a Lisp expression, and
SBCL will read and execute it, print any values returned,
give you another <br>
prompt, and wait for your next input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ sbcl <br>
...[startup messages elided]... <br>
* (+ 1 2 3)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6 <br>
* (exit)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most people like to run SBCL as
a subprocess under Emacs. The Emacs &quot;Slime&quot; mode
provides many convenient features, like command line
editing, tab completion, and various kinds <br>
of coupling between Common Lisp source files and the
interactive SBCL subprocess.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For information on creating
&quot;standalone executables&quot; using SBCL, see
SB-EXT:SAVE-LISP-AND-DIE in the User Manual.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMAND LINE SYNTAX <br>
For ordinary interactive use, no command line arguments
should be necessary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to understand the SBCL
command line syntax, it is helpful to understand that the
system is composed of two parts: a runtime environment, and
the Common Lisp system it <br>
supports. Some command line arguments are processed during
the initialization of the runtime, and some during the
initialization of the Lisp system -- any remaining command
line <br>
arguments are passed on to user code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The overall command line syntax
is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sbcl [runtime options]
--end-runtime-options [toplevel options]
--end-toplevel-options [user options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Both --end-runtime-options and
--end-toplevel-options are optional, and may be omitted.
They are intended for use in situations where any command
line options are under user con&acirc; <br>
trol (e.g. in batch files): by using them you can prevent
options intended for your program being accidentally
processed by SBCL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Supported runtime options
are</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--core &lt;corefilename&gt; <br>
Use the specified Lisp core file instead of the default.
(See the FILES section for the standard core, or the system
documentation for SB-EXT:SAVE-LISP-AND-DIE for information
<br>
about how to create a custom core.) Note that if the Lisp
core file is a user-created core file, it may run a
nonstandard toplevel which does not recognize the standard
<br>
toplevel options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dynamic-space-size
&lt;megabytes&gt; <br>
Size of the dynamic space reserved on startup in megabytes.
Default value is platform dependent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--control-stack-size
&lt;megabytes&gt; <br>
Size of control stack reserved for each thread in megabytes.
Default value is 2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--noinform <br>
Suppress the printing of any banner or other informational
message at startup. (This makes it easier to write Lisp
programs which work cleanly in Unix pipelines. See also the
<br>
&quot;--noprint&quot; and &quot;--disable-debugger&quot;
options.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--disable-ldb <br>
Disable the low-level debugger. Only effective if SBCL is
compiled with LDB.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--lose-on-corruption <br>
There are some dangerous low level errors (for instance,
control stack exhausted, memory fault) that (or whose
handlers) can corrupt the image. By default SBCL prints a
warn&acirc; <br>
ing, then tries to continue and handle the error in Lisp,
but this will not always work and SBCL may malfunction or
even hang. With this option, upon encountering such an <br>
error SBCL will invoke ldb (if present and enabled) or else
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--script &lt;filename&gt; <br>
As a runtime option equivalent to --noinform --disable-ldb
--lose-on-corruption --end-runtime-options --script
&lt;filename&gt;. See the description of --script as a
toplevel option <br>
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--merge-core-pages <br>
When platform support is present, provide hints to the
operating system that identical pages may be shared between
processes until they are written to. This can be useful to
<br>
reduce the memory usage on systems with multiple SBCL
processes started from similar but differently-named core
files, or from compressed cores. Without platform support,
do <br>
nothing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-merge-core-pages <br>
Ensures that no sharing hint is provided to the operating
system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--default-merge-core-pages <br>
Reverts the sharing hint policy to the default: only
compressed cores trigger hinting. Uncompressed cores are
mapped directly from the core file, which is usually enough
to <br>
ensure sharing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help <br>
Print some basic information about SBCL, then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Print SBCL&rsquo;s version information, then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the future, runtime options
may be added to control behavior such as lazy allocation of
memory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Runtime options, including any
--end-runtime-options option, are stripped out of the
command line before the Lisp toplevel logic gets a chance to
see it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The toplevel options supported
by the standard SBCL core are</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--sysinit &lt;filename&gt; <br>
Load filename instead of the default system-wide
initialization file. (See the FILES section.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-sysinit <br>
Do not load a system-wide initialization file. If this
option is given, the --sysinit option is ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--userinit &lt;filename&gt; <br>
Load filename instead of the default user initialization
file. (See the FILES section.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-userinit <br>
Do not load a user initialization file. If this option is
given, the --userinit option is ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--eval &lt;command&gt; <br>
After executing any initialization file, but before starting
the read-eval-print loop on standard input, read and
evaluate the command given. More than one --eval option can
<br>
be used, and all will be read and executed, in the order
they appear on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--load &lt;filename&gt; <br>
This is equivalent to --eval &rsquo;(load
&quot;&lt;filename&gt;&quot;)&rsquo;. The special syntax is
intended to reduce quoting headaches when invoking SBCL from
shell scripts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--noprint <br>
When ordinarily the toplevel &quot;read-eval-print
loop&quot; would be executed, execute a &quot;read-eval
loop&quot; instead, i.e. don&rsquo;t print a prompt and
don&rsquo;t echo results. Combined with the <br>
--noinform runtime option, this makes it easier to write
Lisp &quot;scripts&quot; which work cleanly in Unix
pipelines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--disable-debugger <br>
By default when SBCL encounters an error, it enters the
builtin debugger, allowing interactive diagnosis and
possible intercession. This option disables the debugger,
causing <br>
errors to print a backtrace and exit with status 1 instead
-- which is a mode of operation better suited for batch
processing. See the User Manual on SB-EXT:DISABLE-DEBUGGER
<br>
for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--quit <br>
At the end of toplevel option processing, exit SBCL with a
successful code of zero. Note that the effect of this option
is delayed until after toplevel options following this <br>
one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--non-interactive <br>
This option disables the read-eval-print loop for both
exceptional and non-exceptional reasons. It is short for
--disable-debugger and --quit in combination and is useful
for <br>
batch uses where the special option processing implied by
--script is not desired.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--script &lt;filename&gt; <br>
Implies --no-sysinit --no-userinit --disable-debugger
--end-toplevel-options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Causes the system to load the
specified file and exit immediately afterwards, instead of
entering the read-eval-print loop. If the file begins with a
shebang line, it is <br>
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Regardless of the order in which
toplevel options appear on the command line, the order of
actions is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. Debugger is disabled, if
requested.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Any system initialization
file is loaded, unless prohibited.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. Any user initialization file
is loaded, unless prohibited.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. --eval and --load options are
processed in the order given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, either the
read-eval-print loop is entered or the file specified with
--script option is loaded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When running in the
read-eval-print loop the system exits on end of file.
Similarly, the system exits immediately after processing the
file specified with --script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that when running SBCL with
the --core option, using a core file created by a user call
to the SB-EXT:SAVE-LISP-AND-DIE, the toplevel options may be
under the control of <br>
user code passed as arguments to SB-EXT:SAVE-LISP-AND-DIE.
For this purpose, the --end-toplevel-options option itself
can be considered a toplevel option, i.e. the user core, at
<br>
its option, may not support it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the standard SBCL startup
sequence (i.e. with no user core involved) toplevel options
and any --end-toplevel-options option are stripped out of
the command line argument list <br>
before user code gets a chance to see it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OVERVIEW <br>
SBCL is derived from the CMU CL. (The name is intended to
acknowledge the connection: steel and banking are the
industries where Carnegie and Mellon made the big
bucks.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SBCL compiles by default: even
functions entered in the read-eval-print loop are compiled
to native code, unless the evaluator has been explicitly
turned on. (Even today, some 40 <br>
years after the MacLisp compiler, people will tell you that
Lisp is an interpreted language. Ignore them.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SBCL aims for but has not
completely achieved compliance with the ANSI standard for
Common Lisp. More information about this is available in the
BUGS section below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SBCL also includes various
non-ANSI extensions, described more fully in the User
Manual. Some of these are in the base system and others are
&quot;contrib&quot; modules loaded on request <br>
using REQUIRE. For example, to load the SB-BSD-SOCKETS
module that provides TCP/IP connectivity, <br>
* (require &rsquo;asdf) <br>
* (require &rsquo;sb-bsd-sockets)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For more information, see the
User Manual.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THE COMPILER <br>
SBCL inherits from CMU CL the &quot;Python&quot; native code
compiler. (Though we often avoid that name in order to avoid
confusion with the scripting language also called Python.)
This <br>
compiler is very clever about understanding the type system
of Common Lisp and using it to optimize code, and about
producing notes to let the user know when the compiler
doesn&rsquo;t <br>
have enough type information to produce efficient code. It
also tries (almost always successfully) to follow the
unusual but very useful principle that &quot;declarations
are asser&acirc; <br>
tions&quot;, i.e. type declarations should be checked at
runtime unless the user explicitly tells the system that
speed is more important than safety.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The compiled code uses garbage
collection to automatically manage memory. The garbage
collector implementation varies considerably from CPU to
CPU. In particular, on some CPUs <br>
the GC is nearly exact, while on others it&rsquo;s more
conservative, and on some CPUs the GC is generational, while
on others simpler stop and copy strategies are used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For more information about the
compiler, see the user manual.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS <br>
SBCL currently runs on X86 (Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and
NetBSD), X86-64 (Linux), Alpha (Linux, Tru64), PPC (Linux,
Darwin/MacOS X), SPARC (Linux and Solaris 2.x), and MIPS
<br>
(Linux). For information on other ongoing and possible
ports, see the sbcl-devel mailing list, and/or the web
site.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SBCL requires on the order of
16Mb RAM to run on X86 systems, though all but the smallest
programs would be happier with 32Mb or more.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KNOWN BUGS <br>
This section attempts to list the most serious and
long-standing bugs. For more detailed and current
information on bugs, see the BUGS file in the
distribution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is possible to get in deep
trouble by exhausting heap memory. The SBCL system
overcommits memory at startup, so, on typical Unix-alikes
like Linux and FreeBSD, this means <br>
that if the SBCL system turns out to use more virtual memory
than the system has available for it, other processes tend
to be killed randomly (!).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The compiler&rsquo;s handling of
function return values unnecessarily violates the
&quot;declarations are assertions&quot; principle that it
otherwise adheres to. Using PROCLAIM or DECLAIM to <br>
specify the return type of a function causes the compiler to
believe you without checking. Thus compiling a file
containing <br>
(DECLAIM (FTYPE (FUNCTION (T) NULL) SOMETIMES)) <br>
(DEFUN SOMETIMES (X) (ODDP X)) <br>
(DEFUN FOO (X) (IF (SOMETIMES X) &rsquo;THIS-TIME
&rsquo;NOT-THIS-TIME)) <br>
then running (FOO 1) gives NOT-THIS-TIME, because the
compiler relied on the truth of the DECLAIM without checking
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some things are implemented very
inefficiently.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-- Multidimensional arrays are
inefficient, especially multidimensional arrays of floating
point numbers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-- SBCL, like most (maybe all?)
implementations of Common Lisp on stock hardware, has
trouble passing floating point numbers around efficiently,
because a floating point number, <br>
plus a few extra bits to identify its type, is larger than a
machine word. (Thus, they get &quot;boxed&quot; in
heap-allocated storage, causing GC overhead.) Within a
single compilation <br>
unit, or when doing built-in operations like SQRT and AREF,
or some special operations like structure slot accesses,
this is avoidable: see the user manual for some efficiency
<br>
hints. But for general function calls across the boundaries
of compilation units, passing the result of a floating point
calculation as a function argument (or returning a <br>
floating point result as a function value) is a
fundamentally slow operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REPORTING BUGS <br>
To report a bug, please send mail to the mailing lists
sbcl-help or sbcl-devel. You can find the complete mailing
list addresses on the web pages at
&lt;http://sbcl.source&acirc; <br>
forge.net/&gt;; note that as a spam reduction measure you
must subscribe to the lists before you can post. (You may
also find fancy SourceForge bug-tracking machinery there,
but <br>
don&rsquo;t be fooled. As of 2002-07-25 anyway, we
don&rsquo;t actively monitor that machinery, and it exists
only because we haven&rsquo;t been able to figure out how to
turn it off.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As with any software bug report,
it&rsquo;s most helpful if you can provide enough
information to reproduce the symptoms reliably, and if you
say clearly what the symptoms are. For <br>
example, &quot;There seems to be something wrong with TAN of
very small negative arguments. When I execute (TAN
LEAST-NEGATIVE-SINGLE-FLOAT) interactively on sbcl-1.2.3 on
my Linux <br>
4.5 X86 box, I get an UNBOUND-VARIABLE error.&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIFFERENCES FROM CMU CL <br>
SBCL can be built from scratch using a plain vanilla ANSI
Common Lisp system and a C compiler, and all of its
properties are specified by the version of the source code
that it <br>
was created from. This clean bootstrappability was the
immediate motivation for forking off of the CMU CL
development tree. A variety of implementation differences
are motivated <br>
by this design goal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Maintenance work in SBCL since
the fork has diverged somewhat from the maintenance work in
CMU CL. Many but not all bug fixes and improvements have
been shared between the two <br>
projects, and sometimes the two projects disagree about what
would be an improvement.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most extensions supported by CMU
CL have been unbundled from SBCL, including Motif support,
the Hemlock editor, search paths, the WIRE protocol, various
user-level macros and <br>
functions (e.g. LETF, ITERATE, MEMQ, REQUIRED-ARGUMENT), and
many others.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(Why doesn&rsquo;t SBCL support
more extensions natively? Why drop all those nice extensions
from CMU CL when the code already exists? This is a
frequently asked question on the mail&acirc; <br>
ing list. There are two principal reasons. First, it&rsquo;s
a design philosophy issue: arguably SBCL has done its job by
supplying a stable FFI, and the right design decision is to
<br>
move functionality derived from that, like socket support,
into separate libraries. Some of these are distributed with
SBCL as &quot;contrib&quot; modules, others are distributed
as sepa&acirc; <br>
rate software packages by separate maintainers. Second,
it&rsquo;s a practical decision - focusing on a smaller
number of things will, we hope, let us do a better job on
them.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SUPPORT <br>
Various information about SBCL is available at
&lt;http://www.sbcl.org/&gt;. The mailing lists there are
the recommended place to look for support.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHORS <br>
Dozens of people have made substantial contributions to SBCL
and its subsystems, and to the CMU CL system on which it was
based, over the years. See the CREDITS file in the
dis&acirc; <br>
tribution for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
SBCL_HOME This variable controls where files like
&quot;sbclrc&quot;, &quot;sbcl.core&quot;, and the add-on
&quot;contrib&quot; systems are searched for. If it is not
set, then sbcl sets it from a compile- <br>
time default location which is usually /usr/local/lib/sbcl/
but may have been changed e.g. by a third-party
packager.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
sbcl executable program containing some low-level runtime
support and a loader, used to read sbcl.core</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sbcl.core <br>
dumped memory image containing most of SBCL, to be loaded by
the &lsquo;sbcl&rsquo; executable. Looked for in $SBCL_HOME,
unless overridden by the --core option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sbclrc optional system-wide
startup script, looked for in $SBCL_HOME then /etc, unless
overridden by the --sysinit command line option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">.sbclrc <br>
optional per-user customizable startup script (in
user&rsquo;s home directory, or as specified by
--userinit)</p>
