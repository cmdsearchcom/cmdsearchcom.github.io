SBCL -- Steel Bank Common Lisp
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
SBCL is an implementation of ANSI Common Lisp, featuring a high-performance
  native compiler, native threads on several platforms, a socket interface, a
  source-level debugger, a statistical profiler, and much more.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
It is free software, mostly in the public domain, but with some subsystems under
  BSD-style licenses which allow modification and reuse as long as credit is
  given. It is provided &quot;as is&quot;, with no warranty of any kind.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
For more information about license issues, see the COPYING file in the
  distribution. For more information about history, see the CREDITS file in the

To run SBCL, type &quot;sbcl&quot;. After startup messages a prompt
  (&quot;*&quot;) appears. Enter a Lisp expression, and SBCL will read and
  execute it, print any values returned, give you another prompt, and wait for
  your next input.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 $ sbcl
<br/>
 ...[startup messages elided]...
<br/>

Most people like to run SBCL as a subprocess under Emacs. The Emacs
  &quot;Slime&quot; mode provides many convenient features, like command line
  editing, tab completion, and various kinds of coupling between Common Lisp
  source files and the interactive SBCL subprocess.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
For information on creating &quot;standalone executables&quot; using SBCL, see
  SB-EXT:SAVE-LISP-AND-DIE in the User Manual.

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="COMMAND_LINE_SYNTAX"><a class="selflink" href="#COMMAND_LINE_SYNTAX">COMMAND
  LINE SYNTAX</a></h1>
For ordinary interactive use, no command line arguments should be necessary.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
In order to understand the SBCL command line syntax, it is helpful to understand
  that the system is composed of two parts: a runtime environment, and the
  Common Lisp system it supports. Some command line arguments are processed
  during the initialization of the runtime, and some during the initialization
  of the Lisp system -- any remaining command line arguments are passed on to
  user code.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The overall command line syntax is:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>sbcl [runtime options] --end-runtime-options [toplevel
      options] --end-toplevel-options [user options]</b></dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Both --end-runtime-options and --end-toplevel-options are optional, and may be
  omitted. They are intended for use in situations where any command line
  options are under user control ( <i>e.g.</i> in batch files): by using them
  you can prevent options intended for your program being accidentally processed
  by SBCL.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Supported runtime options are
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>--core &lt;corefilename&gt;</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Use the specified Lisp core file instead of the default.
      (See the FILES section for the standard core, or the system documentation
      for SB-EXT:SAVE-LISP-AND-DIE for information about how to create a custom
      core.) Note that if the Lisp core file is a user-created core file, it may
      run a nonstandard toplevel which does not recognize the standard toplevel
      options.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>--dynamic-space-size &lt;megabytes&gt;</b></dt>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>--noinform</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Suppress the printing of any banner or other informational

</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">

  <dd class="It-tag">There are some dangerous low level errors (for instance,
      control stack exhausted, memory fault) that (or whose handlers) can
      corrupt the image. By default SBCL prints a warning, then tries to
      continue and handle the error in Lisp, but this will not always work and
      SBCL may malfunction or even hang. With this option, upon encountering
      such an error SBCL will invoke ldb (if present and enabled) or else
    exit.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">

<div class="Pp"></div>
In the future, runtime options may be added to control behavior such as lazy
  allocation of memory.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Runtime options, including any --end-runtime-options option, are stripped out of
  the command line before the Lisp toplevel logic gets a chance to see it.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The toplevel options supported by the standard SBCL core are
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>--sysinit &lt;filename&gt;</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Load filename instead of the default system-wide
      initialization file. (See the FILES section.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>--no-sysinit</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Do not load a system-wide initialization file. If this
      option is given, the --sysinit option is ignored.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>--userinit &lt;filename&gt;</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Load filename instead of the default user initialization
      file. (See the FILES section.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>--no-userinit</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Do not load a user initialization file. If this option is
      given, the --userinit option is ignored.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>--eval &lt;command&gt;</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">After executing any initialization file, but before
      starting the read-eval-print loop on standard input, read and evaluate the
      command given. More than one --eval option can be used, and all will be
      read and executed, in the order they appear on the command line.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>--load &lt;filename&gt;</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This is equivalent to --eval '(load
      &quot;&lt;filename&gt;&quot;)'. The special syntax is intended to reduce
      quoting headaches when invoking SBCL from shell scripts.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>--noprint</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">When ordinarily the toplevel &quot;read-eval-print
      loop&quot; would be executed, execute a &quot;read-eval loop&quot;
      instead, <i>i.e.</i> don't print a prompt and don't echo results. Combined
      with the --noinform runtime option, this makes it easier to write Lisp
      &quot;scripts&quot; which work cleanly in Unix pipelines.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>--disable-debugger</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">By default when SBCL encounters an error, it enters the
      builtin debugger, allowing interactive diagnosis and possible
      intercession. This option disables the debugger, causing errors to print a
      backtrace and exit with status 1 instead -- which is a mode of operation
      better suited for batch processing. See the User Manual on
      SB-EXT:DISABLE-DEBUGGER for details.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>--quit</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">At the end of toplevel option processing, exit SBCL with a
      successful code of zero. Note that the effect of this option is delayed
      until after toplevel options following this one.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>--non-interactive</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This option disables the read-eval-print loop for both
      exceptional and non-exceptional reasons. It is short for
      --disable-debugger and --quit in combination and is useful for batch uses
      where the special option processing implied by --script is not
    desired.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>--script &lt;filename&gt;</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Implies --no-sysinit --no-userinit --disable-debugger
      --end-toplevel-options.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Causes the system to load the specified file and exit immediately
      afterwards, instead of entering the read-eval-print loop. If the file
      begins with a shebang line, it is ignored.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Regardless of the order in which toplevel options appear on the command line,
  the order of actions is:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">1.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Debugger is disabled, if requested.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">0[step].</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Any system initialization file is loaded, unless
      prohibited.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">0[step].</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Any user initialization file is loaded, unless
    prohibited.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">0[step].</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">--eval and --load options are processed in the order
    given.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Finally, either the read-eval-print loop is entered or the file specified with
  --script option is loaded.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
When running in the read-eval-print loop the system exits on end of file.
  Similarly, the system exits immediately after processing the file specified
  with --script.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Note that when running SBCL with the --core option, using a core file created by
  a user call to the SB-EXT:SAVE-LISP-AND-DIE, the toplevel options may be under
  the control of user code passed as arguments to SB-EXT:SAVE-LISP-AND-DIE. For
  this purpose, the --end-toplevel-options option itself can be considered a
  toplevel option, <i>i.e.</i> the user core, at its option, may not support it.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
In the standard SBCL startup sequence ( <i>i.e.</i> with no user core involved)
  toplevel options and any --end-toplevel-options option are stripped out of the
  command line argument list before user code gets a chance to see it.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OVERVIEW"><a class="selflink" href="#OVERVIEW">OVERVIEW</a></h1>
SBCL is derived from the CMU CL. (The name is intended to acknowledge the
  connection: steel and banking are the industries where Carnegie and Mellon
  made the big bucks.)
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
SBCL compiles by default: even functions entered in the read-eval-print loop are
  compiled to native code, unless the evaluator has been explicitly turned on.
  (Even today, some 40 years after the MacLisp compiler, people will tell you
  that Lisp is an interpreted language. Ignore them.)
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
SBCL aims for but has not completely achieved compliance with the ANSI standard
  for Common Lisp. More information about this is available in the BUGS section
  below.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
SBCL also includes various non-ANSI extensions, described more fully in the User
  Manual. Some of these are in the base system and others are
  &quot;contrib&quot; modules loaded on request using REQUIRE. For example, to
  load the SB-BSD-SOCKETS module that provides TCP/IP connectivity,
<br/>
 * (require 'asdf)
<br/>
 * (require 'sb-bsd-sockets)
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
For more information, see the User Manual.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="THE_COMPILER"><a class="selflink" href="#THE_COMPILER">THE
  COMPILER</a></h1>
SBCL inherits from CMU CL the &quot;Python&quot; native code compiler. (Though
  we often avoid that name in order to avoid confusion with the scripting
  language also called Python.) This compiler is very clever about understanding
  the type system of Common Lisp and using it to optimize code, and about
  producing notes to let the user know when the compiler doesn't have enough
  type information to produce efficient code. It also tries (almost always
  successfully) to follow the unusual but very useful principle that
  &quot;declarations are assertions&quot;, <i>i.e.</i> type declarations should
  be checked at runtime unless the user explicitly tells the system that speed
  is more important than safety.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The compiled code uses garbage collection to automatically manage memory. The
  garbage collector implementation varies considerably from CPU to CPU. In
  particular, on some CPUs the GC is nearly exact, while on others it's more
  conservative, and on some CPUs the GC is generational, while on others simpler
  stop and copy strategies are used.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
For more information about the compiler, see the user manual.

SBCL currently runs on X86 (Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and NetBSD), X86-64
  (Linux), Alpha (Linux, Tru64), PPC (Linux, Darwin/MacOS X), SPARC (Linux and
  Solaris 2.x), and MIPS (Linux). For information on other ongoing and possible
  ports, see the sbcl-devel mailing list, and/or the web site.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
SBCL requires on the order of 16Mb RAM to run on X86 systems, though all but the
  smallest programs would be happier with 32Mb or more.

This section attempts to list the most serious and long-standing bugs. For more
  detailed and current information on bugs, see the BUGS file in the
  distribution.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
It is possible to get in deep trouble by exhausting heap memory. The SBCL system
  overcommits memory at startup, so, on typical Unix-alikes like Linux and
  FreeBSD, this means that if the SBCL system turns out to use more virtual
  memory than the system has available for it, other processes tend to be killed
  randomly (!).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The compiler's handling of function return values unnecessarily violates the
  &quot;declarations are assertions&quot; principle that it otherwise adheres
  to. Using PROCLAIM or DECLAIM to specify the return type of a function causes
  the compiler to believe you without checking. Thus compiling a file containing
<br/>
 (DECLAIM (FTYPE (FUNCTION (T) NULL) SOMETIMES))
<br/>
 (DEFUN SOMETIMES (X) (ODDP X))
<br/>
 (DEFUN FOO (X) (IF (SOMETIMES X) 'THIS-TIME 'NOT-THIS-TIME))
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
then running (FOO 1) gives NOT-THIS-TIME, because the compiler relied on the
  truth of the DECLAIM without checking it.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Some things are implemented very inefficiently.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">--</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Multidimensional arrays are inefficient, especially
      multidimensional arrays of floating point numbers.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">--</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">SBCL, like most (maybe all?) implementations of Common Lisp
      on stock hardware, has trouble passing floating point numbers around
      efficiently, because a floating point number, plus a few extra bits to
      identify its type, is larger than a machine word. (Thus, they get
      &quot;boxed&quot; in heap-allocated storage, causing GC overhead.) Within
      a single compilation unit, or when doing built-in operations like SQRT and
      AREF, or some special operations like structure slot accesses, this is
      avoidable: see the user manual for some efficiency hints. But for general
      function calls across the boundaries of compilation units, passing the
      result of a floating point calculation as a function argument (or
      returning a floating point result as a function value) is a fundamentally
      slow operation.</dd>

  FROM CMU CL</a></h1>
SBCL can be built from scratch using a plain vanilla ANSI Common Lisp system and
  a C compiler, and all of its properties are specified by the version of the
  source code that it was created from. This clean bootstrappability was the
  immediate motivation for forking off of the CMU CL development tree. A variety
  of implementation differences are motivated by this design goal.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Maintenance work in SBCL since the fork has diverged somewhat from the
  maintenance work in CMU CL. Many but not all bug fixes and improvements have
  been shared between the two projects, and sometimes the two projects disagree
  about what would be an improvement.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Most extensions supported by CMU CL have been unbundled from SBCL, including
  Motif support, the Hemlock editor, search paths, the WIRE protocol, various
  user-level macros and functions ( <i>e.g.</i> LETF, ITERATE, MEMQ,
  REQUIRED-ARGUMENT), and many others.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
(Why doesn't SBCL support more extensions natively? Why drop all those nice
  extensions from CMU CL when the code already exists? This is a frequently
  asked question on the mailing list. There are two principal reasons. First,
  it's a design philosophy issue: arguably SBCL has done its job by supplying a
  stable FFI, and the right design decision is to move functionality derived
  from that, like socket support, into separate libraries. Some of these are
  distributed with SBCL as &quot;contrib&quot; modules, others are distributed
  as separate software packages by separate maintainers. Second, it's a
  practical decision - focusing on a smaller number of things will, we hope, let
  us do a better job on them.)
