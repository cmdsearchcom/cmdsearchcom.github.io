smokeping_cgi - SmokePing webfrontend
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OVERVIEW"><a class="selflink" href="#OVERVIEW">OVERVIEW</a></h1>
This script acts as a 'website' for your SmokePing monitoring operation. It
  presents the targets you are looking at in a tree structure and draws graphs
  as they are required by people looking at the pages.

To get <b>smokeping_cgi</b> going, you need a webserver which allows you to run
  CGI or better FastCGI scripts. The system must be setup so that the cgi
  process is allowed to write to the image caching area as defined in the config
  file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This script runs fine as a normal CGI, <b>BUT</b> it will appear to be very
  slow, because it does a lot of things when starting up. So if the script has
  to be started a fresh on every click, this is both slow and a tough thing for
  your webserver. I therefore strongly recommend using FastCGI.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Please refer to the installation document for detailed setup instructions.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SETUP"><a class="selflink" href="#SETUP">SETUP</a></h1>
There is a sample <i>htdocs</i> directory in your smokeping installation root.
  Copy its content to the place where your webserver expects its files. There
  are also two sample cgi scripts showing how to launch the smokeping cgi in
  your website. The only difference is the file extension. Adjust the paths in
  the script and you should be ready to go.
