<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
smokeping_cgi - SmokePing webfrontend</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OVERVIEW <br>
This script acts as a &rsquo;website&rsquo; for your
SmokePing monitoring operation. It presents the targets you
are looking at in a tree structure and draws graphs as they
are required by <br>
people looking at the pages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
To get smokeping_cgi going, you need a webserver which
allows you to run CGI or better FastCGI scripts. The system
must be setup so that the cgi process is allowed to write to
<br>
the image caching area as defined in the config file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This script runs fine as a
normal CGI, BUT it will appear to be very slow, because it
does a lot of things when starting up. So if the script has
to be started a fresh on every <br>
click, this is both slow and a tough thing for your
webserver. I therefore strongly recommend using FastCGI.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please refer to the installation
document for detailed setup instructions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SETUP <br>
There is a sample htdocs directory in your smokeping
installation root. Copy its content to the place where your
webserver expects its files. There are also two sample cgi
<br>
scripts showing how to launch the smokeping cgi in your
website. The only difference is the file extension. Adjust
the paths in the script and you should be ready to go.</p>
