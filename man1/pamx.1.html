<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pamx - display Netpbm image in X Window System window</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pamx</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[-fullscreen] [-install]
[-private] [-fit] [-pixmap] [-verbose] [-display=x-display]
[-title=text] [-foreground=color] [-background=color]
[-border=color] [-geometry=x-geometry- <br>
string] [-visual=name] netpbm_file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All options can be abbreviated
to their shortest unique prefix. You may use two hyphens
instead of one to designate an option. You may use either
white space or an equals sign <br>
between an option name and its value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This program is part of Netpbm(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pamx displays a Netpbm image in
an X Window System window. It is like a very simple version
of the classic X image viewer xloadimage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you don&rsquo;t specify the
input file netpbm_file, the input is from Standard Input.
The input image can be any Netpbm image format. If the input
is a multi-image stream, pamx <br>
ignores all but the first image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pamx is not the best choice for
general purpose viewing of images, because it is a
traditional simple Netpbm building block. It is a good thing
to build into other programs and <br>
can be useful for debugging more complex systems, but you
can get much more powerful viewers that can display Netpbm
images. For example, xloadimage, xli, xzgv, and any web <br>
browser.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The program xwud (X Window
Undump) is part of the X Window System and performs the same
basic display function, though with input in the special X
Window Dump format (for which <br>
Netpbm has converters).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The initial window is at most
90% of the size of the display unless the window manager
does not correctly handle window size requests or if
you&rsquo;ve used the -fullscreen option. <br>
You may move the image around in the window by dragging with
the first mouse button. The cursor will indicate which
directions you may drag, if any. You may exit the window by
<br>
typing &rsquo;q&rsquo; or control-C when the keyboard focus
is on the window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ppmsvgalib is a similar program
that displays an image on a Linux system without the need
for the X Window System.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">X RESOURCE CLASS <br>
pamx uses the resource class name Xloadimage for window
managers which need this resource set. This is, of course,
the same resource class that the conventional viewer program
<br>
xloadimage uses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-border=color <br>
This sets the background portion of the window which is not
covered by any images to be color.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-display=display_name <br>
This names the X display in which to put the window. E.g.
0:0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fit Force image to use the
default visual and colormap. This is useful if you do not
want technicolor effects when the colormap focus is inside
the image window, but it may <br>
reduce the quality of the displayed image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fullscreen <br>
Use the entire screen to display the image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-geometry=WxH[{+,-}X{+,-}Y <br>
This sets the size and position of the window in which pamx
displays the image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, the window size
exactly matches the image size, except that if you
don&rsquo;t specify -fullscreen, the maximum is 90% of the
screen dimensions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-install <br>
Forcibly install the image&rsquo;s colormap when the window
is focused. This violates ICCCM standards and only exists to
allow operation with naive window managers. Use this <br>
option only if your window manager does not install
colormaps properly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pixmap <br>
Force the use of a pixmap as backing-store. This is provided
for servers where backing-store is broken (such as some
versions of the AIXWindows server). It may improve <br>
scrolling performance on servers which provide
backing-store.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-private <br>
Force pamx to use of a private colormap. By default, pamx
allocates colors shared unless there are not enough colors
available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-verbose <br>
Causes pamx to print various information about what
it&rsquo;s doing to Standard Error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-visual=visual_name <br>
Force the use of a specific visual type to display an image.
By default, pamx tries to pick the best available image for
a particular image type. The available visual <br>
types are: DirectColor, TrueColor, PseudoColor, StaticColor,
GrayScale, and StaticGray. You may use the shortest unique
prefix of these names, and case is not signifi&acirc; <br>
cant.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-background=color <br>
Use color as the background color instead of the default
(usually white but this depends on the image type) if you
are transferring a monochrome image to a color display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-foreground=color <br>
Use color as the foreground color instead of black if you
are transferring a monochrome image to a color display. You
can also use this to invert the foreground and back&acirc;
<br>
ground colors of a monochrome image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-title=text <br>
Set the title bar title of the window. Default is the file
name of the input file, or &rsquo;stdin&rsquo; if the image
is from Standard Input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY <br>
pamx was new in Netpbm 10.34 (May 2006).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pamx is essentially based on the
classic X displayer program xloadimage by Jim Frost, 1989.
Bryan Henderson stripped it down and adapted it to Netpbm in
March 2006.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following features of
xloadimage are left out of pamx, to be more compatible with
Netpbm&rsquo;s philosophy of simple building blocks. Note
that there are other programs in Netpbm <br>
that do most of these things:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; zoom in/out</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; ability to
accept formats other than Netpbm</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; image
transformations (brightening, clipping, rotating, etc)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; decompressing
and other decoding of input</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; ability to
display on the root window</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; slide show</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pamx also differs from
xloadimage in that it uses Libnetpbm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is virtually no code from
xloadimage actually in pamx, because Bryan rewrote it all to
make it easier to understand.</p>
