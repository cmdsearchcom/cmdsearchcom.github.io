<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
jclic-libmanager - Utility to manage JClic libraries at
system level</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
jclic-libmanager [OPTION] [NAME] [FILE]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This manual page describes briefly the jclic-library
command. This manual page was written for the Debian
GNU/Linux distribution. It only contains the description of
the basic <br>
options. For full manuals and documentation please visit:
<br>
http://clic.xtec.cat and
https://github.com/projectestac/jclic/wiki</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">JClic is formed by a set of
computer applications that are used for carrying out
different types of educational activities: puzzles,
associations, text exercises, crosswords... <br>
If you want to check about how JClic projects are, you
should take a look at: <br>
http://clic.xtec.cat/db/listact_en.jsp</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">JClic activities are packed in
JClic projects. Projects are sets of activities organized in
one or more sequences, which indicate the order in which
they have to be shown. <br>
Projects can be organized into JClic Libraries. Libraries
are collections of JClic projects, often structured in
folders and subfolders. When JClic starts, it can
automatically <br>
show the main library. When more than one library is defined
JClic shows a list, allowing users to select one. <br>
Each user can have its own JClic Library, usually placed in
~/JClic/projects. JClic libraries are encapsulated into XML
files. These files are named &quot;library.jclic&quot; by
default. <br>
System-wide libraries can also be specified. These
system-wide libraries are usually &quot;read-only&quot;, and
shown to everyone without the need of per-user settings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">JClic Library Manager is a tool
intended to be used by admin users to list, add and remove
references to JClic Libraries at system level. It should be
called always as a supe&acirc; <br>
ruser (e.g.: &quot;sudo jclic-libmanager -list&quot;)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-list List the name and path of the current JClic libraries
defined at system level.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-add name path <br>
Adds the &quot;library.jclic&quot; file pointed by
&quot;path&quot; into the list of JClic system libraries. If
&quot;name&quot; has blanks, please enclose it within double
quotes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-remove name <br>
Remove the specified library from the list of JClic
libraries defined at system level. Please enter the exact
name, as obtained by a call to &quot;sudo jclic-libmanager
<br>
-list&quot;, and enclose it within double quotes in case it
has blanks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-help Displays a short abstract
of the options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHORS <br>
JClic was written by Francesc Busquets
&lt;fbusquets@xtec.cat&gt; for the Department of Education
of the Government of Catalonia.</p>
