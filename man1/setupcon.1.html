<p>SETUPCON(1) Console-setup User&rsquo;s Manual
SETUPCON(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
setupcon - sets up the font and the keyboard on the
console</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
setupcon [OPTION]... [VARIANT]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
setupcon is a program for fast and easy setup of the font
and the keyboard on the console. Most of the time you invoke
setupcon without arguments. The keyboard configuration is
<br>
specified in ~/.keyboard or /etc/default/keyboard. The font
configuration is specified in ~/.console-setup or
/etc/default/console-setup. Consult keyboard(5) and
console-set&acirc; <br>
up(5) for instructions how to configure these two files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you have to switch often
between different encodings, keyboards or languages, you can
prepare several alternative configuration files for
setupcon. Suppose that most of the <br>
time you will use Greek language with Greek keyboard layout,
but sometimes you need to type in German with German
keyboard layout. In this situation you should customize the
<br>
main configuration files (keyboard and console-setup) for
Greek. Also, create alternative configuration files for
German named keyboard.german and console-setup.german. Then
in <br>
order to configure the console for Greek you will simply run
the command with no arguments: setupcon and in order to
configure the console for German you will use <br>
setupcon german.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
VARIANT <br>
Specifies which configuration file to use. With no variant,
the configuration files of setupcon are named console-setup
and keyboard. On the other hand, if you use e.g. <br>
chukchi as VARIANT then the configuration files are
console-setup.chukchi and keyboard.chukchi. In this way you
can have easy access to several different configurations -
<br>
for example one for the Chukchi language and another for the
default configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
Be more verbose. Use this option if something goes wrong or
while experimenting with the configuration files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k, --keyboard-only <br>
Setup the keyboard only, do not setup the font.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, --font-only <br>
Setup the font only, do not setup the keyboard.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--force <br>
Do not check whether we are on the console. Notice that you
can be forced to hard-reboot your computer if you run
setupcon with this option and the screen is controlled <br>
by a X server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--save This option can be useful
if you want to use setupcon early in the boot process while
/usr is not yet mounted and the required data are not
available. This option will <br>
make setupcon copy the required files in /etc/console-setup/
in order to make them available before /usr is mounted. If
you use setupcon early in the boot process, then <br>
you should run it with this option after every change of the
console configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--save-only <br>
The same as --save, but does not setup the keyboard and the
font. This option can be useful if you want to save the
required files while the screen is controlled by a X <br>
server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--save-keyboard FILE <br>
For use by initrd builders. Do not configure anything. Save
an usable keyboard layout in FILE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--setup-dir DIR <br>
For use by initrd builders. Do not configure anything.
Arrange in the directory DIR everything necessary in order
to configure the console. The file DIR/morefiles lists <br>
all binaries the initrd builder has to install in the initrd
image. All other files in DIR have to be copied unchanged in
the initrd. In order to configure the console <br>
one has to run the script DIR/bin/setupcon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Display usage information.</p>
