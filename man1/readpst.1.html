<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
readpst - convert PST (MS Outlook Personal Folders) files to
mbox and other formats</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
readpst [-C default-charset] [-D] [-M] [-S] [-V] [-b] [-c
format] [-d debug-file] [-e] [-h] [-j jobs] [-k] [-m] [-o
output-directory] [-q] [-r] [-t output-type-codes] [-u] [-w]
<br>
pstfile</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
readpst is a program that can read an Outlook PST (Personal
Folders) file and convert it into an mbox file, a format
suitable for KMail, a recursive mbox structure, or separate
<br>
emails.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-C default-charset <br>
Set the character set to be used for items with an
unspecified character set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D <br>
Include deleted items in the output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M <br>
Output messages in MH (rfc822) format as separate files.
This will create folders as named in the PST file, and will
put each email together with any attachments into its own
<br>
file. These files will be numbered from 1 to n with no
leading zeros. This format has no from quoting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S <br>
Output messages into separate files. This will create
folders as named in the PST file, and will put each email in
its own file. These files will be numbered from 1 to n with
<br>
no leading zeros. Attachments will also be saved in the same
folder as the email message. The attachments for message $m
are saved as $m-$name where $name is (the original <br>
name of the attachment, or
&Acirc;&acute;attach$n&Acirc;&acute; if the attachment had
no name), where $n is another sequential index with no
leading zeros. This format has no from quoting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V <br>
Show program version and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b <br>
Do not save the attachments for the RTF format of the email
body.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c format <br>
Set the Contact output mode. Use -cv for vcard format or -cl
for an email list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d debug-file <br>
Specify name of debug log file. The log file is now an ascii
file, instead of the binary file used in previous
versions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e <br>
Same as the M option, but each output file will include an
extension from (.eml, .ics, .vcf). This format has no from
quoting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h <br>
Show summary of options and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-j jobs <br>
Specifies the maximum number of parallel jobs. Specify 0 to
suppress running parallel jobs. Folders may be processed in
parallel. Output formats that place each mail message <br>
in a separate file (-M, -S, -e) may process the contents of
individual folders in parallel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k <br>
Changes the output format to KMail. This format uses mboxrd
from quoting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m <br>
Same as the e option, but write .msg files also</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o output-directory <br>
Specifies the output directory. The directory must already
exist, and is entered after the PST file is opened, but
before any processing of files commences.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q <br>
Changes to silent mode. No feedback is printed to the
screen, except for error messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r <br>
Changes the output format to Recursive. This will create
folders as named in the PST file, and will put all emails in
a file called &quot;mbox&quot; inside each folder. These
files are <br>
then compatible with all mbox-compatible email clients. This
format uses mboxrd from quoting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t output-type-codes <br>
Specifies the item types that are processed. The argument is
a sequence of single letters from (e,a,j,c) for (email,
appointment, journal, contact) types. The default is to <br>
process all item types.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u <br>
Sets Thunderbird mode, a submode of recursive mode. This
causes two extra .type and .size meta files to be created.
This format uses mboxrd from quoting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w <br>
Overwrite any previous output files. Beware: When used with
the -S switch, this will remove all files from the target
folder before writing. This is to keep the count of <br>
emails and attachments correct.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FROM QUOTING <br>
Output formats that place each mail message in a separate
file (-M, -S, -e, -m) don&Acirc;&acute;t do any from
quoting. Output formats that place multiple email messages
in a single file (-k, <br>
-r, -u) now use mboxrd from quoting rules. If none of those
switches are specified, the default output format uses
mboxrd from quoting rules, since it produces multiple email
<br>
messages in a single file. Earlier versions used mboxo from
quoting rules for all output formats.</p>
