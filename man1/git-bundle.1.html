<p>GIT-BUNDLE(1) Git Manual GIT-BUNDLE(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
git-bundle - Move objects and refs by archive</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
git bundle create &lt;file&gt; &lt;git-rev-list-args&gt;
<br>
git bundle verify &lt;file&gt; <br>
git bundle list-heads &lt;file&gt; [&lt;refname&gt;...] <br>
git bundle unbundle &lt;file&gt; [&lt;refname&gt;...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Some workflows require that one or more branches of
development on one machine be replicated on another machine,
but the two machines cannot be directly connected, and
therefore <br>
the interactive Git protocols (git, ssh, rsync, http) cannot
be used. This command provides support for git fetch and git
pull to operate by packaging objects and references in <br>
an archive at the originating machine, then importing those
into another repository using git fetch and git pull after
moving the archive by some means (e.g., by sneakernet). As
<br>
no direct connection between the repositories exists, the
user must specify a basis for the bundle that is held by the
destination repository: the bundle assumes that all objects
<br>
in the basis are already in the destination repository.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
create &lt;file&gt; <br>
Used to create a bundle named file. This requires the
git-rev-list-args arguments to define the bundle
contents.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">verify &lt;file&gt; <br>
Used to check that a bundle file is valid and will apply
cleanly to the current repository. This includes checks on
the bundle format itself as well as checking that the <br>
prerequisite commits exist and are fully linked in the
current repository. git bundle prints a list of missing
commits, if any, and exits with a non-zero status.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list-heads &lt;file&gt; <br>
Lists the references defined in the bundle. If followed by a
list of references, only references matching those given are
printed out.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unbundle &lt;file&gt; <br>
Passes the objects in the bundle to git index-pack for
storage in the repository, then prints the names of all
defined references. If a list of references is given, only
<br>
references matching those in the list are printed. This
command is really plumbing, intended to be called only by
git fetch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;git-rev-list-args&gt; <br>
A list of arguments, acceptable to git rev-parse and git
rev-list (and containing a named ref, see SPECIFYING
REFERENCES below), that specifies the specific objects and
<br>
references to transport. For example, master~10..master
causes the current master reference to be packaged along
with all objects added since its 10th ancestor commit. There
<br>
is no explicit limit to the number of references and objects
that may be packaged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[&lt;refname&gt;...] <br>
A list of references used to limit the references reported
as available. This is principally of use to git fetch, which
expects to receive only those references asked for and <br>
not necessarily everything in the pack (in this case, git
bundle acts like git fetch-pack).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SPECIFYING REFERENCES <br>
git bundle will only package references that are shown by
git show-ref: this includes heads, tags, and remote heads.
References such as master~1 cannot be packaged, but are <br>
perfectly suitable for defining the basis. More than one
reference may be packaged, and more than one basis can be
specified. The objects packaged are those not contained in
the <br>
union of the given bases. Each basis can be specified
explicitly (e.g. ^master~10), or implicitly (e.g.
master~10..master, --since=10.days.ago master).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is very important that the
basis used be held by the destination. It is okay to err on
the side of caution, causing the bundle file to contain
objects already in the <br>
destination, as these are ignored when unpacking at the
destination.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLE <br>
Assume you want to transfer the history from a repository R1
on machine A to another repository R2 on machine B. For
whatever reason, direct connection between A and B is not
<br>
allowed, but we can move data from A to B via some mechanism
(CD, email, etc.). We want to update R2 with development
made on the branch master in R1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To bootstrap the process, you
can first create a bundle that does not have any basis. You
can use a tag to remember up to what commit you last
processed, in order to make it easy <br>
to later update the other repository with an incremental
bundle:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">machineA$ cd R1 <br>
machineA$ git bundle create file.bundle master <br>
machineA$ git tag -f lastR2bundle master</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Then you transfer file.bundle to
the target machine B. Because this bundle does not require
any existing object to be extracted, you can create a new
repository on machine B by <br>
cloning from it:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">machineB$ git clone -b master
/home/me/tmp/file.bundle R2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This will define a remote called
&quot;origin&quot; in the resulting repository that lets you
fetch and pull from the bundle. The $GIT_DIR/config file in
R2 will have an entry like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[remote &quot;origin&quot;] <br>
url = /home/me/tmp/file.bundle <br>
fetch = refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To update the resulting mine.git
repository, you can fetch or pull after replacing the bundle
stored at /home/me/tmp/file.bundle with incremental
updates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After working some more in the
original repository, you can create an incremental bundle to
update the other repository:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">machineA$ cd R1 <br>
machineA$ git bundle create file.bundle lastR2bundle..master
<br>
machineA$ git tag -f lastR2bundle master</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You then transfer the bundle to
the other machine to replace /home/me/tmp/file.bundle, and
pull from it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">machineB$ cd R2 <br>
machineB$ git pull</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you know up to what commit
the intended recipient repository should have the necessary
objects, you can use that knowledge to specify the basis,
giving a cut-off point to <br>
limit the revisions and objects that go in the resulting
bundle. The previous example used the lastR2bundle tag for
this purpose, but you can use any other options that you
would <br>
give to the git-log(1) command. Here are more examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can use a tag that is
present in both:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git bundle create mybundle
v1.0.0..master</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can use a basis based on
time:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git bundle create mybundle
--since=10.days master</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can use the number of
commits:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git bundle create mybundle -10
master</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can run git-bundle verify to
see if you can extract from a bundle that was created with a
basis:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git bundle verify mybundle</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This will list what commits you
must have in order to extract from the bundle and will error
out if you do not have them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A bundle from a recipient
repository&acirc;s point of view is just like a regular
repository which it fetches or pulls from. You can, for
example, map references when fetching:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git fetch mybundle
master:localRef</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also see what references
it offers:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git ls-remote mybundle</p>
