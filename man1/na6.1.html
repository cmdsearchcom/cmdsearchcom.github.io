<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
na6 allows the assessment of IPv6 implementations with
respect to a variety of attack vectors based on ICMPv6
Neighbor Advertisement messages. It is part of the SI6
Networks&rsquo; <br>
IPv6 Toolkit: a security assessment suite for the IPv6
Protocols.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This tool has two modes of
operation: active and passive. In active mode, the tool
attacks a specific target, while in passive mode the tool
listens to traffic on the local net&acirc; <br>
work, and launches an attack in response to such traffic.
Active mode is employed if a destination address (IPv6
Destination Address or Ethernet Destination Address) and a
Target <br>
Address are specified. Passive mode is employed if the
&quot;-L&quot; option (or its long counterpart
&quot;--listen&quot;) is set. If both an attack target and
the &quot;-L&quot; option are set, the attack <br>
is launched against the specified target, and then the tool
enters passive mode to respond incoming Neighbor
Solicitation messages with Neighbor Advertisement (attack)
packets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The tool supports filtering of
incoming Neighbor Solicitation messages based on the
Ethernet Source Address, the Ethernet Destination Address,
the IPv6 Source Address, the IPv6 <br>
Destination Address, and the Neighbor Solicitation Target
Address. There are two types of filters: &quot;block
filters&quot; and &quot;accept filters&quot;. If any
&quot;block filter&quot; is specified, and <br>
the incoming Neighbor Solicitation message matches any of
those filters, the message is discarded (and thus no
Neighbor Advertisements are sent in response). If any
&quot;accept fil&acirc; <br>
ter&quot; is specified, incoming Neighbor Solicitation
messages must match the specified filters in order for the
na6 tool to respond with Neighbor Advertisement
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
na6 takes its parameters as command-line options. Each of
the options can be specified with a short name (one
character preceded with the hyphen character, as e.g.
&quot;-i&quot;) or with <br>
a long name (a string preceded with two hyphen characters,
as e.g. &quot;--interface&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Depending on the amount of
information (i.e., options) to be conveyed into the Neighbor
Advertisements, it may be necessary for the na6 tool to
split that information into more <br>
than one Neighbor Advertisement message. Also, if the tool
is instructed to flood the victim with Neighbor
Advertisements from different sources
(&quot;--flood-sources&quot; option), mul&acirc; <br>
tiple packets may need to be generated. na6 supports IPv6
fragmentation, which may be of use if a large amount of
information needs to be conveyed within a single Neighbor
Adver&acirc; <br>
tisement message. However, IPv6 fragmentation is not enabled
by default, and must be explicitly enabled with the
&quot;-y&quot; option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i INTERFACE, --interface
INTERFACE <br>
This option specifies the network interface that the tool
will use. If the destination address (&quot;-d&quot; option)
is a link-local address, or the &quot;listening&quot;
(&quot;-L&quot;) mode is <br>
selected, the interface must be explicitly specified. The
interface may also be specified along with a destination
address, with the &quot;-d&quot; option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s SRC_ADDR, --src-address
SRC_ADDR</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option specifies the IPv6
source address (or IPv6 prefix) to be used for the Source
Address of the attack packets. If left unspecified, a random
link-local unicast <br>
address (fe80::/64) is selected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the &quot;-T&quot;
(&quot;--flood-targets&quot;) option is specified, this
option includes an IPv6 prefix. See the description of the
&quot;-T&quot; option for further information on how the
&quot;-s&quot; <br>
option is processed in that specific case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d DST_ADDR, --dst-address
DST_ADDR</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option specifies the IPv6
Destination Address of the victim. If left unspecified, but
the Ethernet Destination Address is specified, the
&quot;all-nodes link-local multi&acirc; <br>
cast&quot; address (ff02::1) is selected as the IPv6
Destination Address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When operating in passive mode
(&quot;-L&quot; option), the IPv6 Destination Address is
selected according to the IPv6 Source Address of the
incoming Neighbor Solicitation message. <br>
If the IPv6 Source Address of the Neighbor Solicitation is
the unspecified address (::), the &quot;all-nodes link-local
multicast&quot; address (ff02::1) is used as the IPv6
Desti&acirc; <br>
nation Address. Otherwise, the IPv6 Source Address of the
incoming Neighbor Solicitation message is used as the IPv6
Destination Address of the outgoing Neighbor Adver&acirc;
<br>
tisement (attack) messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--hop-limit, -A</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option specifies the Hop
Limit to be used for the Neighbor Advertisement messages. It
defaults to 255. Note that IPv6 nodes are required to check
that the Hop Limit <br>
of incoming Neighbor Advertisement messages is 255.
Therefore, this option is only useful to assess whether an
IPv6 implementation fails to enforce the aforementioned <br>
check.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-y SIZE, --frag-hdr SIZE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option specifies that the
resulting packet must be fragmented. The fragment size must
be specified as an argument to this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u HDR_SIZE, --dst-opt-hdr
HDR_SIZE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option specifies that a
Destination Options header is to be included in the
resulting packet. The extension header size must be
specified as an argument to this <br>
option (the header is filled with padding options). Multiple
Destination Options headers may be specified by means of
multiple &quot;-u&quot; options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U HDR_SIZE, --dst-opt-u-hdr
HDR_SIZE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option specifies a
Destination Options header to be included in the
&quot;unfragmentable part&quot; of the resulting packet. The
header size must be specified as an argument to <br>
this option (the header is filled with padding options).
Multiple Destination Options headers may be specified by
means of multiple &quot;-U&quot; options. This option is
only valid <br>
if the &quot;-y&quot; option is specified (as the concept of
&quot;unfragmentable part&quot; only makes sense when
fragmentation is employed).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H HDR_SIZE, --hbh-opt-hdr
HDR_SIZE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option specifies that a
Hop-by-Hop Options header is to be included in the resulting
packet. The header size must be specified as an argument to
this option (the <br>
header is filled with padding options). Multiple Hop-by-Hop
Options headers may be specified by means of multiple
&quot;-H&quot; options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S SRC_LINK_ADDR,
--src-link-address SRC_LINK_ADDR</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option specifies the
link-layer Source Address of the Neighbor Advertisement
messages (this option is only valid for Ethernet
interfaces). If left unspecified, the <br>
link-layer Source Address is randomized.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When operating in passive mode,
the link-layer Source Address is selected according to the
IPv6 Destination Address of the incoming Neighbor
Solicitation message. If the <br>
IPv6 Destination Address of the incoming Neighbor
Solicitation message is a multicast address (usually a
solicited-node multicast address), the link-layer Source
Address <br>
is set to the address specified by the &quot;-S&quot; option
(or to a random address if the &quot;-S&quot; option was
left unspecified). If the IPv6 Destination Address of the
incoming Neigh&acirc; <br>
bor Solicitation is not a multicast address (i.e., it is a
unicast address), the link-layer Source Address is set to
the Ethernet Destination Address of the incoming <br>
Neighbor Solicitation message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D DST_LINK_ADDR,
--dst-link-address DST_LINK_ADDR</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option specifies the
link-layer Destination Address of the Neighbor Advertisement
messages (this option is only valid for Ethernet
interfaces). If left unspecified, <br>
it is set to the &quot;all-nodes link-local multicast&quot;
address (ff02::1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When operating in passive mode,
the link-layer Destination Address is set according to the
IPv6 Source Address of the incoming Neighbor Solicitation
message. If the IPv6 <br>
Source Address of the incoming Neighbor Solicitation message
is the unspecified address (::), the link-layer destination
address is set to &quot;33:33:00:00:00:01&quot; (the
Ether&acirc; <br>
net multicast address corresponding to the IPv6
&quot;all-nodes link-local multicast&quot; address).
Otherwise, the link-layer Destination Address is set to the
link-layer Source <br>
Address of the incoming Neighbor Solicitation message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--router, -r</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option instructs the na6
tool to set the &quot;R&quot; (Router) bit in the Neighbor
Advertisement messages that it sends. The &quot;R&quot; bit
indicates that the node sending the mes&acirc; <br>
sage is a router. If left unspecified, the &quot;R&quot; bit
is not set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--solicited, -c</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option instructs the na6
tool to set the &quot;S&quot; (&quot;Solicited&quot;) bit in
the Neighbor Advertisement messages that it sends. When
operating in passive mode (&quot;-L&quot; option), the <br>
&quot;Solicited&quot; flag is forced to 1 in all responses
sent to unicast IPv6 addresses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--override, -o</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option instructs the na6
tool to set the &acirc;O&acirc; (&quot;Override&quot;) bit
in the Neighbor Advertisement messages that it sends. If
this option is left unspecified, the &acirc;O&acirc; bit is
<br>
not set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--target, -t</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option specifies the IPv6
Target Address of the Neighbor Advertisement messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the &quot;-T&quot;
(&quot;--flood-targets&quot;) option is specified, this
option specifies an IPv6 prefix in the form &quot;-t
prefix/prefixlen&quot;. See the description of the
&quot;-T&quot; option for <br>
further information on how the &quot;-t&quot; option is
processed in that specific case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--target-lla-opt, -E</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option specifies the
contents of a target link-layer address option to be
included in the Neighbor Advertisement messages. If a single
option is specified, it is <br>
included in all the outgoing Neighbor Advertisement
messages. If more than one target link-layer address is
specified (by means of multiple &quot;-E&quot; options), and
all the <br>
resulting options cannot be conveyed into a single Neighbor
Advertisement message, multiple Neighbor Advertisements will
be sent as needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--add-tlla-opt, -e</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option instructs the na6
tool to include a target link-layer address option in the
Neighbor Advertisement messages that it sends. The target
link-layer address <br>
included in the option is the same as the Ethernet Source
Address used for the outgoing Neighbor Advertisement
messages. The difference between this option and the
&quot;-E&quot; <br>
option is that the &quot;-e&quot; option does not specify
the actual value of the option, but just instructs the tool
to include a target link-layer address option (the actual
value <br>
of the option is selected as explained before).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-j SRC_ADDR, --block-src
SRC_ADDR</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option sets a block filter
for the incoming packets, based on their IPv6 Source
Address. It allows the specification of an IPv6 prefix in
the form &quot;-j prefix/pre&acirc; <br>
fixlen&quot;. If the prefix length is not specified, a
prefix length of &quot;/128&quot; is selected (i.e., the
option assumes that a single IPv6 address, rather than an
IPv6 prefix, has <br>
been specified).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k DST_ADDR, --block-dst
DST_ADDR</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option sets a block filter
for the incoming Neighbor Solicitation messages, based on
their IPv6 Destination Address. It allows the specification
of an IPv6 prefix in <br>
the form &quot;-k prefix/prefixlen&quot;. If the prefix
length is not specified, a prefix length of &quot;/128&quot;
is selected (i.e., the option assumes that a single IPv6
address, rather <br>
than an IPv6 prefix, has been specified).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-J SRC_ADDR, --block-link-src
SRC_ADDR</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option sets a block filter
for the incoming packets, based on their link-layer Source
Address. The option must be followed by a link-layer address
(this option is <br>
only valid for Ethernet interfaces).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-K DST_ADDR, --block-link-dst
DST_ADDR</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option sets a block filter
for the incoming packets, based on their link-layer
Destination Address. The option must be followed by a
link-layer address (this option <br>
is only valid for Ethernet interfaces).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b SRC_ADDR, --accept-src
SRC_ADDR</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option sets an accept
filter for the incoming packets, based on their IPv6 Source
Address. It allows the specification of an IPv6 prefix in
the form &quot;-b prefix/pre&acirc; <br>
fixlen&quot;. If the prefix length is not specified, a
prefix length of &quot;/128&quot; is selected (i.e., the
option assumes that a single IPv6 address, rather than an
IPv6 prefix, has <br>
been specified).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g DST_ADDR, --accept-dst
DST_ADDR</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option sets a accept filter
for the incoming packets, based on their IPv6 Destination
Address. It allows the specification of an IPv6 prefix in
the form &quot;-g pre&acirc; <br>
fix/prefixlen&quot;. If the prefix length is not specified,
a prefix length of &quot;/128&quot; is selected (i.e., the
option assumes that a single IPv6 address, rather than an
IPv6 pre&acirc; <br>
fix, has been specified).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B SRC_ADDR, --accept-link-src
SRC_ADDR</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option sets an accept
filter for the incoming Neighbor Solicitation messages,
based on their link-layer Source Address. The option must be
followed by a link-layer <br>
address (this option is only valid for Ethernet
interfaces).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-G DST_ADDR, --accept-link-dst
DST_ADDR</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option sets an accept
filter for the incoming packets, based on their link-layer
Destination Address. The option must be followed by a
link-layer address (this option <br>
is only valid for Ethernet interfaces).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--block-target, -w</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option sets a block filter
for the incoming Neighbor Solicitation messages, based on
their Target Address. It allows the specification of an IPv6
prefix in the form <br>
&quot;-w prefix/prefixlen&quot;. If the prefix length is not
specified, a prefix length of &quot;/128&quot; is selected
(i.e., the option assumes that a single IPv6 address, rather
than an <br>
IPv6 prefix, has been specified).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--accept-target, -W</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option sets a accept filter
for the incoming Neighbor Solicitation messages, based on
their Target Address. It allows the specification of an IPv6
prefix in the form <br>
&quot;-W prefix/prefixlen&quot;. If the prefix length is not
specified, a prefix length of &quot;/128&quot; is selected
(i.e., the option assumes that a single IPv6 address, rather
than an <br>
IPv6 prefix, has been specified).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--flood-targets, -T</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option instructs the na6
tool to send Neighbor Advertisements for multiple Target
Addresses. The number of different Target Addresses is
specified as &quot;-T number&quot;. The <br>
Target Address of each packet is randomly selected from the
prefix fe80::/64, unless a different prefix has been
specified by means of the &quot;-t&quot; option. The IPv6
Source <br>
Address of each Neighbor Advertisement message is set
according to the IPv6 address or prefix specified with the
&quot;-s&quot; option, and defaults to a random link-local
unicast <br>
address (fe80::/64) if the &quot;-s&quot; option is left
unspecified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--flood-sources, -F</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option instructs the tool
to send multiple Neighbor Advertisement messages with
different Source Addresses. The number of different sources
is specified as &quot;-F num&acirc; <br>
ber&quot;. The Source Address of each Neighbor Advertisement
is randomly selected from the prefix specified by the
&quot;-s&quot; option. If the &quot;-F&quot; option is
specified but the &quot;-s&quot; <br>
option is left unspecified, the Source Address of the
packets is randomly selected from the prefix fe80::/64
(link-local unicast). It should be noted that hosts are <br>
required to discard Router Advertisement messages that do
not have a link-local unicast address as the Source
Address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--loop, -l</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option instructs the na6
tool to send periodic Neighbor Advertisements to the victim
node. The amount of time to pause between sending Neighbor
Advertisements can be <br>
specified by means of the &quot;-z&quot; option, and
defaults to 1 second. Note that this option cannot be set in
conjunction with the &quot;-L&quot; (&quot;--listen&quot;)
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--sleep, -z</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option specifies the amount
of time to pause between sending Neighbor Solicitations
(when the &quot;--loop&quot; option is set). If left
unspecified, it defaults to 1 second.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--listen, -L</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This instructs the na6 tool to
operate in passive mode (possibly after attacking a given
node, if the &acirc;-d&acirc; or &acirc;-D&acirc; options
were specified). Note that this option cannot be <br>
used in conjunction with the &quot;-l&quot;
(&quot;--loop&quot;) option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--verbose, -v</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option instructs the na6
tool to be verbose. When the option is set twice, the tool
is &quot;very verbose&quot;, and the tool also informs which
packets have been accepted or <br>
discarded as a result of applying the specified filters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help, -h</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Print help information for the
na6 tool.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
The following sections illustrate typical use cases of the
na6 tool.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example #1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># na6 -i eth0 -d fe80::1 -t
2001:db8::1 -c -o -e</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use the network interface
&quot;eth0&quot; to send a Neighbor Advertisement using a
random link-local unicast IPv6 Source Address and a random
Ethernet Source Address, to the IPv6 Destina&acirc; <br>
tion address ffe80::1 and the Ethernet Destination Address
33:33:00:00:00:01 (selected by default). The target of the
Neighbor Advertisement is 2001:db8::1, and the message has
<br>
both the &quot;Override&quot; and the &quot;Solicited&quot;
flags set. The Neighbor Advertisement also includes a target
link-layer address option that contains the same Ethernet
address as that <br>
used for the Ethernet Source Address of the packet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example #2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># na6 -i eth0 -j fe80::1 -j
2001:db8::/32 -W fe80::/64 -c -o -e -L -v -v</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Listen for incoming Neighbor
Solicitation messages on the interface &quot;eth0&quot;.
Discard those messages that have an IPv6 Source Address
equal to fe80::1, an IPv6 Source Address that <br>
belongs to the prefix 2001:db8::/32, or a Target Address
that does not belong to the prefix fe80::/64. Respond (to
those messages that are accepted) with a Neighbor
Advertisement <br>
with a randomized Ethernet Source Address and a randomized
link-local unicast IPv6 Source Address (unless the
Destination Address of the Neighbor Solicitation was a
unicast <br>
address), the IPv6 Destination Address set to the Source
Address of the incoming NS message (unless it was the
unspecified address), the Target Address set to the same
value as <br>
the Target Address of the incoming NS, and the
&quot;Solicited&quot; and &quot;Override&quot; flags set. Be
very verbose (&quot;-v -v&quot; options).</p>
