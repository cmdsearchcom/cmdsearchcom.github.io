<p>BPCLOCK(1) BP executables BPCLOCK(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
bpclock - Bundle Protocol (BP) daemon task for managing
scheduled events</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
bpclock</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
bpclock is a background &quot;daemon&quot; task that
periodically performs scheduled Bundle Protocol activities.
It is spawned automatically by bpadmin in response to the
&rsquo;s&rsquo; command that <br>
starts operation of Bundle Protocol on the local ION node,
and it is terminated by bpadmin in response to an
&rsquo;x&rsquo; (STOP) command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once per second, bpclock takes
the following action:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">First it (a) destroys all
bundles whose TTLs have expired, (b) enqueues for
re-forwarding all bundles that were expected to have been
transmitted (by convergence-layer output <br>
tasks) by now but are still stuck in their assigned
transmission queues, and (c) enqueues for re-forwarding all
bundles for which custody has not yet been taken that were
<br>
expected to have been received and acknowledged by now (as
noted by invocation of the bpMemo() function by some
convergence-layer adapter that had CL-specific insight into
<br>
the appropriate interval to wait for custody
acceptance).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Then bpclock adjusts the
transmission and reception &quot;throttles&quot; that
control rates of LTP transmission to and reception from
neighboring nodes, in response to data rate <br>
changes as noted in the RFX database by rfxclock.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bpclock then checks for bundle
origination activity that has been blocked due to
insufficient allocated space for BP traffic in the ION data
store: if space for bundle <br>
origination is now available, bpclock gives the bundle
production throttle semaphore to unblock that activity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, bpclock applies rate
control to all convergence-layer protocol inducts and
outducts:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For each induct, bpclock
increases the current capacity of the duct by the applicable
nominal data reception rate. If the revised current capacity
is greater than zero, <br>
bpclock gives the throttle&rsquo;s semaphore to unblock data
acquisition (which correspondingly reduces the current
capacity of the duct) by the associated convergence layer
<br>
input task.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For each outduct, bpclock
increases the current capacity of the duct by the applicable
nominal data transmission rate. If the revised current
capacity is greater than <br>
zero, bpclock gives the throttle&rsquo;s semaphore to
unblock data transmission (which correspondingly reduces the
current capacity of the duct) by the associated convergence
<br>
layer output task.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
&quot;0&quot; bpclock terminated, for reasons noted in the
ion.log file. If this termination was not commanded,
investigate and solve the problem identified in the log file
and use <br>
bpadmin to restart bpclock.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;1&quot; bpclock was unable
to attach to Bundle Protocol operations, probably because
bpadmin has not yet been run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
No configuration files are needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
No environment variables apply.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
The following diagnostics may be issued to the ion.log log
file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bpclock can&rsquo;t attach to
BP. <br>
bpadmin has not yet initialized BP operations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t dispatch events.
<br>
An unrecoverable database error was encountered. bpclock
terminates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t adjust throttles.
<br>
An unrecoverable database error was encountered. bpclock
terminates.</p>
