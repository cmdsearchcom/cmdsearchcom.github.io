bpclock - Bundle Protocol (BP) daemon task for managing scheduled events
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<b>bpclock</b>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>bpclock</b> is a background &quot;daemon&quot; task that periodically
  performs scheduled Bundle Protocol activities. It is spawned automatically by
  <b>bpadmin</b> in response to the 's' command that starts operation of Bundle
  Protocol on the local ION node, and it is terminated by <b>bpadmin</b> in
  response to an 'x' (STOP) command.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Once per second, <b>bpclock</b> takes the following action:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">First it (a) destroys all bundles whose TTLs
  have expired, (b) enqueues for re-forwarding all bundles that were expected to
  have been transmitted (by convergence-layer output tasks) by now but are still
  stuck in their assigned transmission queues, and (c) enqueues for
  re-forwarding all bundles for which custody has not yet been taken that were
  expected to have been received and acknowledged by now (as noted by invocation
  of the <i>bpMemo()</i> function by some convergence-layer adapter that had
  CL-specific insight into the appropriate interval to wait for custody
  acceptance).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Then <b>bpclock</b> adjusts the transmission and reception &quot;throttles&quot;
  that control rates of LTP transmission to and reception from neighboring
  nodes, in response to data rate changes as noted in the RFX database by
  <b>rfxclock</b>.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>bpclock</b> then checks for bundle origination activity that has been blocked
  due to insufficient allocated space for BP traffic in the ION data store: if
  space for bundle origination is now available, <b>bpclock</b> gives the bundle
  production throttle semaphore to unblock that activity.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Finally, <b>bpclock</b> applies rate control to all convergence-layer protocol
  inducts and outducts:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">For each induct, <b>bpclock</b> increases the
  current capacity of the duct by the applicable nominal data reception rate. If
  the revised current capacity is greater than zero, <b>bpclock</b> gives the
  throttle's semaphore to unblock data acquisition (which correspondingly
  reduces the current capacity of the duct) by the associated convergence layer
  input task.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
For each outduct, <b>bpclock</b> increases the current capacity of the duct by
  the applicable nominal data transmission rate. If the revised current capacity
  is greater than zero, <b>bpclock</b> gives the throttle's semaphore to unblock
  data transmission (which correspondingly reduces the current capacity of the
  duct) by the associated convergence layer output task.</div>
