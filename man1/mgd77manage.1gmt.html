<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
mgd77manage - Manage the content of MGD77+ files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
mgd77manage NGDC-ids [ -A[+]a|c|d|D|e|E|g|i|n|t|Tfileinfo ]
[ -Cf|g|e ] [ -Dabbrev1,abbrev2,...) ] [ -Eempty ] [ -F ] [

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: No space is allowed
between the option flag and the associated arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
mgd77manage deals with maintaining extra custom columns in
MGD77+ netCDF files. You can either delete one or more
columns, add a new column, update an existing column with
new <br>
data, or supply error correction information (*.e77 files).
New data may come from a table (ASCII unless -bi is used),
be based on existing columns and certain theoretical <br>
expressions, or they may be obtained by sampling a grid
(choose between GMT grid or a Sandwell/Smith Mercator *.img
grid) along track. The new data will be appended to the
MGD77+ <br>
file in the form of an extra data column of specified type.
The data file will be modified; no new file will be created.
For the big issues, see the DISCUSSION section below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REQUIRED ARGUMENTS <br>
NGDC-ids <br>
Can be one or more of five kinds of specifiers:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. 8-character NGDC IDs, e.g.,
01010083, JA010010etc., etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. 2-character &lt;agency&gt;
codes which will return all cruises from each agency.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. 4-character
&lt;agency&gt;&lt;vessel&gt; codes, which will return all
cruises from those vessels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. =&lt;list&gt;, where
&lt;list&gt; is a table with NGDC IDs, one per line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5. If nothing is specified we
return all cruises in the data base.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(See mgd77info -L for agency and
vessel codes). The &quot;.mgd77&quot; or &quot;.nc&quot;
extensions will automatically be appended, if needed (use -I
to ignore certain file types). Cruise <br>
files will be looked for first in the current directory and
second in all directories listed in
$MGD77_HOME/mgd77_paths.txt [If $MGD77_HOME is not set it
will default to <br>
$GMT_SHAREDIR/mgd77].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS <br>
-A[+]a|c|d|D|e|E|g|i|n|t|Tfileinfo <br>
Add a new data column. If an existing column with the same
abbreviation already exists in the file we will cowardly
refuse to update the file. Specifying -A+ overcomes <br>
this reluctance (However, sometimes an existing column
cannot be upgraded without first deleting it; if so you will
be warned). Select a column source code among a, c, d, <br>
D, e, g, i, n, t, or T; detailed descriptions for each
choice follow:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a Append filename of a single
column table to add. File must have the same number of rows
as the MGD77+ file. If no file is given we read from stdin
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c Create a new column that
derives from existing data or formulas for corrections and
reference fields. Append c for the Carter corrections
subtracted from uncorrected <br>
depths, g for the IGF gravity reference field (a.k.a
&quot;normal gravity&quot;), m for the IGRF total field
magnetic reference field, and r for recomputed magnetic
anomaly (append <br>
1 or 2 to specify which total field column to use [1]). For
gravity we choose the reference field based on the parameter
Gravity Theoretical Formula Code in the cruise&rsquo;s <br>
MGD77 header. If this is not set or is invalid we default to
the IGF 1980. You can override this behavior by appending
the desired code: 1 = Heiskanen 1924, 2 = Interna&acirc;
<br>
tional 1930, 3 = IGF1967, or 4 = IGF1980.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">d Append filename of a
two-column table with the first column holding distances
along track and the second column holding data values. If no
file is given we read from <br>
stdin instead. Records with matching distances in the MGD77+
file will be assigned the new values; at other distances we
set them to NaN. Alternatively, give upper case D <br>
instead and we will interpolate the column at all record
distances. See -N for choosing distance units and -C for
choosing how distances are calculated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">e Expects to find an e77
error/correction log from mgd77sniffer with the name
NGDC_ID.e77 in the current directory or in $MGD77_HOME/E77;
this file will examined and used <br>
to make modifications to the header values, specify a
systematic correction for certain columns (such as scale and
offset), specify that a certain anomaly should be
recal&acirc; <br>
culated from the observations (e.g., recalculate mag from
mtf1 and the latest IGRF), and add or update the special
column flag which may hold bitflags (0 = GOOD, 1 = BAD) <br>
for each data field in the standard MGD77 data set. Any
fixed correction terms found (such as needing to scale a
field by 0.1 or 10 because the source agency used
incor&acirc; <br>
rect units) will be written as attributes to the netCDF
MGD77+ file and applied when the data are read by mgd77list.
Ephemeral corrections such as those determined by <br>
crossover analysis are not kept in the data files but reside
in correction tables (see mgd77list for details). By
default, the first character of each header line in the <br>
e77 file (which is ?, Y or N) will be consulted to see if
the corresponding adjustment should be applied. If any
undecided settings are found (i.i, ?) we will abort and <br>
make no changes. Only records marked Y will be processed.
You can override this behavior by appending one or more
modifiers to the -Ae command: h will ignore all header <br>
corrections, f will ignore all fixed systematic trend
corrections, n, v, and s will ignore bitflags pertaining to
navigation, data values, and data slopes, respectively. <br>
Use -A+e to replace any existing E77 corrections in the file
with the new values. Finally, e77 corrections will not be
applied if the E77 file has not been verified. Use <br>
-AE to ignore the verification status.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">g Sample a GMT geographic (lon,
lat) grid along the track given by the MGD77+ file using
bicubic interpolation (however, see -n). Append name of a
GMT grid file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">i Sample a Sandwell/Smith
Mercator *.img grid along the track given by the MGD77+ file
using bicubic interpolation (however, see -n). Append the
img grid filename, fol&acirc; <br>
lowed by the comma-separated data scale (typically 1 or
0.1), the IMG file mode (0-3), and optionally the img grid
max latitude [80.738]. The modes stand for the follow&acirc;
<br>
ing: (0) Img files with no constraint code, returns data at
all points, (1) Img file with constraints coded, return data
at all points, (2) Img file with constraints <br>
coded, return data only at constrained points and NaN
elsewhere, and (3) Img file with constraints coded, return 1
at constraints and 0 elsewhere.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">n Append filename of a
two-column table with the first column holding the record
number (0 to nrows - 1) and the second column holding data
values. If no file is given we <br>
read from stdin instead. Records with matching record
numbers in the MGD77+ file will be assigned the new values;
at other records we set them to NaN.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">t Append filename of a
two-column table with the first column holding absolute
times along track and the second column holding data values.
If no file is given we read <br>
from stdin instead. Records with matching times in the
MGD77+ file will be assigned the new values; at other times
we set them to NaN. Alternatively, give upper case T <br>
instead and we will interpolate the column at all record
times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Cf|g|e <br>
Append a one-letter code to select the procedure for
along-track distance calculation when using -Ad|D (see -N
for selecting distance units):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f Flat Earth distances.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">g Great circle distances
[Default].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">e Geodesic distances on current
GMT ellipsoid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Dabbrev1,abbrev2,...) <br>
Give a comma-separated list of column abbreviations that you
want to delete from the MGD77+ files. Do NOT use this option
to remove columns that you are replacing with new <br>
data (use -A+ instead). Because we cannot remove variables
from netCDF files we must create a new file without the
columns to be deleted. Once the file is successfully <br>
created we temporarily rename the old file, change the new
filename to the old filename, and finally remove the old,
renamed file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Eempty <br>
Give a single character that will be repeated to fill empty
string values, e.g., &quot;9&quot; will yield a string like
&quot;99999...&quot; [9].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F Force mode. When this mode is
active you are empowered to delete or replace even the
standard MGD77 set of columns. You better know what you are
doing!</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Iabbrev/name/unit/t/scale/offset/comment
<br>
In addition to file information we must specify additional
information about the extra column. Specify a short (16 char
or less, using lower case letters, digits, or <br>
underscores only) abbreviation for the selected data, its
more descriptive name, the data unit, the data type
1-character code (byte, short, float, int, double, or text)
<br>
you want used for storage in the netCDF file, any scale and
offset we should apply to the data to make them fit inside
the range implied by the chosen storage type, and a <br>
general comment (&lt; 128 characters) regarding what these
data represent. Note: If text data type is selected then the
terms &quot;values&quot; in the -A discussion refer to your
text <br>
data. Furthermore, the discussion on interpolation does not
apply and the NaN value becomes a &quot;no string&quot;
value (see -E for what this is). Place quotes around terms
with <br>
more than one word (e.g., &quot;Corrected Depth&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Nunit Append the distance unit
(see UNITS). [Default is -Nk (km)]. Only relevant when -Ag|i
is selected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R[unit]xmin/xmax/ymin/ymax[r]
(more ...) <br>
Specify the region of interest. Only relevant when -Ag|i is
selected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V[level] (more ...) <br>
Select verbosity level [c].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-bi[ncols][t] (more ...) <br>
Select native binary input. This applies to the input 1- or
2-column data files specified under some of the -A options.
The binary input option is only available for <br>
numerical data columns.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dinodata (more ...) <br>
Replace input columns that equal nodata with NaN.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n[b|c|l|n][+a][+bBC][+c][+tthreshold]
(more ...) <br>
Select interpolation mode for grids.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-^ or just - <br>
Print a short message about the syntax of the command, then
exits (NOTE: on Windows use just -).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-+ or just + <br>
Print an extensive usage (help) message, including the
explanation of any module-specific option (but not the GMT
common options), then exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-? or no arguments <br>
Print a complete usage (help) message, including the
explanation of options, then exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UNITS <br>
For map distance unit, append unit d for arc degree, m for
arc minute, and s for arc second, or e for meter [Default],
f for foot, k for km, M for statute mile, n for nautical
<br>
mile, and u for US survey foot. By default we compute such
distances using a spherical approximation with great
circles. Prepend - to a distance (or the unit is no distance
is <br>
given) to perform &quot;Flat Earth&quot; calculations
(quicker but less accurate) or prepend + to perform exact
geodesic calculations (slower but more accurate).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONSEQUENCES OF GRID RESAMPLING
<br>
Resample or sampling of grids will use various algorithms
(see -n) that may lead to possible distortions or unexpected
results in the resampled values. One expected effect of <br>
resampling with splines is the tendency for the new
resampled values to slightly exceed the global min/max
limits of the original grid. If this is unacceptable, you
can impose <br>
clipping of the resampled values values so they do not
exceed the input min/max values by adding +c to your -n
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DISCUSSION <br>
1. Preamble</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The mgd77 supplement is an
attempt to (1) improve on the limited functionality of the
existing mgg supplement, (2) incorporate some of the ideas
from Scripps&rsquo; gmt+ supplement by <br>
allowing extra data columns, and (3) add new capabilities
for managing marine geophysical trackline data stored in an
architecture-independent CF-1.0- and COARDS-compliant netCDF
<br>
file format. Here are some of the underlying ideas and steps
you need to take to maintain your files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Introduction</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Our starting point is the MGD77
ASCII data files distributed from NGDC on CD-ROMS, DVD-ROMS,
and via FTP. Using Geodas to install the files locally we
choose the &quot;Carter cor&acirc; <br>
rected depth&quot; option which will fill in the depth
column using the two-way travel-times and the Carter tables
if twt is present. This step yields ~5000 individual cruise
files. <br>
Place these in one or more sub-directories of your choice,
list these sub-directories (one per line) in the file
mgd77_paths.txt, and place that file in the directory
pointed to <br>
by $MGD77_HOME; if not set this variable defaults to
$GMT_SHAREDIR/mgd77.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. Conversion</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Convert the ASCII MGD77 files to
the new netCDF MGD77+ format using mgd77convert. Typically,
you will make a list of all the cruises to be converted
(with or without extension), <br>
and you then run <br>
mgd77convert =cruises.lis -Fa -Tc -V -Lwe+ &gt; log.txt</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The verbose settings will ensure
that all problems found during conversion will be reported.
The new *.nc files may also be placed in one or more
separate sub-directories and <br>
these should also be listed in the mgd77_paths.txt file. We
suggest you place the directories with *.nc files ahead of
the *.mgd77 directories. When you later want to limit a <br>
search to files of a certain extension you should use the -I
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. Adding new columns</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mgd77manage will allow you to
add additional data columns to your *.nc files. These can be
anything, including text strings, but most likely are
numerical values sampled along <br>
the track from a supplied grid or an existing column that
have been filtered or manipulated for a particular purpose.
The format supports up to 32 such extra columns. See this
<br>
man page for how to add columns. You may later decide to
remove some of these columns or update the data associated
with a certain column. Data extraction tools such as
mgd77list <br>
can be used to extract a mix of standard MGD77 columns
(navigation, time, and the usual geophysical observations)
and your custom columns.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5. Error sources</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Before we discuss how to correct
errors we will first list the different classes of errors
associated with MGD77 data: (1) Header record errors occur
when some of the information <br>
fields in the header do not comply with the MGD77
specification or required information is missing.
mgd77convert will list these errors when the extended
verbose setting is <br>
selected. These errors typically do not affect the data and
are instead errors in the meta-data (2). Fixed systematic
errors occur when a particular data column, despite the <br>
MGD77 specification, has been encoded incorrectly. This
usually means the data will be off by a constant factor such
as 10 or 0.1, or in some cases even 1.8288 which converts
<br>
fathoms to meters. (3) Unknown systematic errors occur when
the instrument that recorded the data or the processing that
followed introduced signals that appear to be systematic
<br>
functions of time along track, latitude, heading, or some
other combination of terms that have a physical or logical
explanation. These terms may sometimes be resolved by data
<br>
analysis techniques such as along-track and across-track
investigations, and will result in correction terms that
when applied to the data will remove these unwanted signals
in <br>
an optimal way. Because these correction terms may change
when new data are considered in their determination, such
corrections are considered to be ephemeral. (4) Individual
<br>
data points or sequences of data may violate rules such as
being outside of possible ranges or in other ways violate
sanity. Furthermore, sequences of points that may be within
<br>
valid ranges may give rise to data gradients that are
unreasonable. The status of every point can therefore be
determined and this gives rise to bitflags GOOD or BAD. Our
policy <br>
is that error sources 1, 2, and 4 will be corrected by
supplying the information as meta-data in the relevant *.nc
files, whereas the corrections for error source 3 (because
they <br>
will constantly be improved) will be maintained in a
separate list of corrections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6. Finding errors</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The mgd77sniffer is a tool that
does a thorough along-track sanity check of the original
MGD77 ASCII files and produces a corresponding *.e77 error
log. All problems found are <br>
encoded in the error log, and recommended fixed correction
terms are given, if needed. An analyst may verify that the
suggested corrections are indeed valid (we only want to
cor&acirc; <br>
rect truly obvious unit errors), edit these error logs and
modify such correction terms and activate them by changing
the relevant code key (see mgd77sniffer for more details).
<br>
mgd77manage can ingest these error logs and (1) correct bad
header records given the suggestions in the log, (2) insert
scale/offset correction terms to be used when reading
cer&acirc; <br>
tain columns, and (3) insert any bit-flags found. Rerun this
step if you later find other problems as all E77 settings or
flags will be recreated based on the latest E77 log.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">7. Error corrections</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The extraction program mgd77list
allows for corrections to be applied on-the-fly when data
are requested. First, data with BAD bitflags are suppressed.
Second, data with fixed <br>
systematic correction terms are corrected accordingly.
Third, data with ephemeral correction terms will have those
corrections applied (if a correction table is supplied). All
of <br>
these steps require the presence of the relevant meta-data
and all can be overruled by the user. In addition, users may
add their own bitflags as separate data columns and use <br>
mgd77list&rsquo;s logical tests to further dictate which
data are suppressed from output.</p>
