<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
gpsmon - real-time GPS packet monitor and control
utility</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
gpsmon [-L] [-V] [-h] [-n] [-a] [-l logfile] [-t
driver-prefix] [[ server [:port [:device]] | device]] [-D
debuglevel]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
gpsmon is a monitor that watches packets coming from a GPS
and displays them along with diagnostic information. It
supports commands that can be used to tweak GPS settings in
<br>
various ways; some are device-independent, some vary with
the GPS chipset type. It will behave sanely, just dumping
packets, when connected to a GPS type it knows nothing
about.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gpsmon differs from a navigation
client in that it mostly dumps raw data from the GPS, with
only enough data-massaging to allow checks against expected
output. In particular, <br>
this tool does not do any interpolation or modeling to
derive climb/sink or error estimates. Nor does it discard
altitude reports when the fix quality is too low.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unlike gpsd, gpsmon never writes
control or probe strings to the device unless you explicitly
tell it to. Thus, while it will auto-sync to binary packet
types, it won&rsquo;t <br>
automatically reecognize a device shipping an extended NMEA
protocol as anything other than a plain NMEA device. Use the
-t option or the t to work around this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gpsmon is a designed to run in a
terminal emulator with a minimum 25x80 size; the non-GUI
interface is a design choice made to accommodate users
operating in constrained <br>
environments and over telnet or ssh connections. If run in a
larger window, the size of the packet-log window will be
increased to fit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gpsmon accepts an -h option that
displays a usage message, or a -V option to dump the package
version and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This program may be run in
either of two modes, as a client for the gpsd daemon (and
its associated control socket) or directly connected to a
specified serial device. When run <br>
with no argument, it attempts to connect to the daemon. If
the argument begins with a server:port specification it will
also attempt to connect to the daemon. If the argument <br>
looks like a bare server name it will attempt to connect to
a daemon running on the default gpsd port on that server.
Only if the device argument contains slashes but no colons
<br>
will it be treated as a serial device for direct connection.
In direct-connect mode gpsmon will hunt for a correct baud
rate and lock on to it automatically. Possible cases look
<br>
like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">localhost:/dev/ttyS1 <br>
Look at the default port of localhost, trying both IPv4 and
IPv6 and watching output from serial device 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">example.com:2317 <br>
Look at port 2317 on example.com, trying both IPv4 and
IPv6.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">71.162.241.5:2317:/dev/ttyS3
<br>
Look at port 2317 at the specified IPv4 address, collecting
data from attached serial device 3.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">[FEDC:BA98:7654:3210:FEDC:BA98:7654:3210]:2317:/dev/ttyS5
<br>
Look at port 2317 at the specified IPv6 address, collecting
data from attached serial device 5.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unlike gpsd, gpsmon run in
direct mode does not do its own device probing. Thus, in
particular, if you point it at a GPS with a native binary
mode that happens to be emitting <br>
NMEA, it won&rsquo;t identify the actual type unless the
device emits a recognizable NMEA trigger sentence. The -t
and -i options may help you.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -F option is only valid in
client mode; it specifies a control socket to which the
program should send device control strings. You must specify
a valid pathname of a <br>
Unix-domain socket on your local filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -D option enables
packet-getter debugging output and is probably only useful
to developers of the GPSD code. Consult the packet-getter
source code for relevant values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -L option lists a table
showing which GPS device types gpsmon has built-in support
for, and which generic commands can be applied to which GPS
types, and then exits. Note <br>
that this does not list type-specific commands associated
with individual GPS types.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -l option sets up logging to
a specified file to start immediately on device open. This
may be useful is, for example, you want to capture the
startup message from a device <br>
that displays firmware version information there.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -n option forces gpsmon to
request NMEA0183 packets instead of the raw datastream from
gpsd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -t option sets up a fallback
type. Give it a string that is a distinguishing prefix of
exactly one driver type name; this will be used for mode,
speed, and rate switching if <br>
the driver selected by the packet type lacks those
capabilities. Most useful when the packet type is NMEA but
the device is known to have a binary mode, such as SiRF
binary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -a option enables a special
debugging mode that does not use screen painting. Packets
are dumped normally; any character typed suspends packet
dumping and brings up a command <br>
prompt. This feature will mainly be of interest to GPSD
developers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After startup (without -a), the
top part of the screen reports the contents of several
especially interesting packet types. The &quot;PPS&quot;
field, if nonempty, is the delta between the <br>
last 1PPS top of second and the system clock at that
time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The bottom half of the screen is
a scrolling hex dump of all packets the GPS is issuing. If
the packet type is textual, any trailing CR/LF is omitted.
Dump lines beginning &gt;&gt;&gt; <br>
represent control packets sent to the GPS. Lines consisting
of &quot;PPS&quot; surrounded by dashes, if present,
indicate 1PPS and the start of the reporting cycle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMANDS <br>
The following device-independent commands are available
while gpsmon is running:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">i <br>
(Direct mode only.) Enable/disable subtype probing and
reinitialize the driver. In normal operation, gpsmon does
not send configuration strings to the device (except for
<br>
wakeup strings needed to get it to send data, if any). The
command &rsquo;i1&rsquo; causes it to send the same sequence
of subtype probes that gpsd would. The command
&rsquo;i0&rsquo; turns off <br>
probing; &rsquo;i&rsquo; alone toggles the bit. In either
case, the current driver is re-selected; if the probe bit is
enabled, probes will begin to be issued immediately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that enabling probing might
flip the device into another mode; in particular, it will
flip a SiRF chip into binary mode as if you had used the
&acirc;n&acirc; command. This is due <br>
to a limitation in the SiRF firmware that we can&rsquo;t
fix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command will generally do
nothing after the first time you use it, because the device
type will already have been discovered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c <br>
(Direct mode only.) Change cycle time. Follow it with a
number interpreted as a cycle time in seconds. Most devices
have a fixed cycle time of 1 second, so this command may
<br>
fail with a message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">l <br>
Toggle packet logging. If packet logging is on, it will be
turned off and the log closed. If it is off, logging to the
filename following the l will be enabled. Differs from <br>
simply capturing the data from the GPS device in that only
whole packets are logged. The logfile is opened for append,
so you can log more than one portion of the packet <br>
stream and they will be stitched together correctly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">n <br>
(Direct mode only.) With an argument of 0, switch device to
NMEA mode at current speed; with an argument of 1, change to
binary (native) mode. With no argument, toggle the <br>
setting. Will show an error if the device doesn&rsquo;t have
such modes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After you switch a dual-protocol
GPS to NMEA mode wityh this command, it retains the
information about the original type and its control
capabilities. That is why the device <br>
type listed before the prompt doesn&rsquo;t change.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">q <br>
Quit gpsmon. Control-C, or whatever your current interrupt
character is, works as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">s <br>
(Direct mode only.) Change baud rate. Follow it with a
number interpreted as bits per second, for example
&quot;s9600&quot;. The speed number may optionally be
followed by a colon and <br>
a wordlength-parity-stopbits specification in the
traditional style, e.g 8N1 (the default), 7E1, etc. Some
devices don&rsquo;t support serial modes other than their
default, so <br>
this command may fail with a message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use this command with caution.
On USB and Bluetooth GPSes it is also possible for serial
mode setting to fail either because the serial adaptor chip
does not support non-8N1 <br>
modes or because the device firmware does not properly
synchronize the serial adaptor chip with the UART on the GPS
chipset when the speed changes. These failures can hang <br>
your device, possibly requiring a GPS power cycle or (in
extreme cases) physically disconnecting the NVRAM backup
battery.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">t <br>
(Direct mode only.) Force a switch of monitoring type.
Follow it with a string that is unique to the name of a gpsd
driver with gpsmon support; gpsmon will switch to using <br>
that driver and display code. Will show an error message if
there is no matching gpsd driver, or multiple matches, or
the unique match has no display support in gpsmon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">x <br>
(Direct mode only.) Send hex payload to device. Following
the command letter you may type hex digit pairs; end with a
newline. These will become the payload of a control <br>
packet shipped to the device. The packet will be wrapped
with headers, trailers, and checksum appropriate for the
current driver type. The first one or two bytes of the <br>
payload may be specially interpreted, see the description of
the -x of gpsctl(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">X <br>
(Direct mode only.) Send raw hex bytes to device. Following
the command letter you may type hex digit pairs; end with a
newline. These will be shipped to the device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ctrl-S <br>
Freeze display, suspend scrolling in debug window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ctrl-Q <br>
Unfreeze display, resume normal operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NMEA support <br>
(These remarks apply to not just generic NMEA devices but
all extended NMEA devices for which gpsmon presently has
support.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All fields are raw data from the
GPS except (a) the &quot;Cooked PVT&quot; window near top of
screen, provided as a check and (b) the &quot;PPS
offset&quot; field.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are no device-specific
commands. Which generic commands are available may vary by
type: examine the output of gpsmon -l to learn more.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SiRF support <br>
Most information is raw from the GPS. Underlined fields are
derived by translation from ECEF coordinates or application
of leap-second and local time-zone offsets. 1PPS is the <br>
clock lag as usual.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following commands are
supported for SiRF GPSes only:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A <br>
(Direct mode only.) Toggle reporting of 50BPS subframe
data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">M <br>
(Direct mode only.) Set (M1) or clear (M0) static
navigation. The SiRF documentation says &acirc;Static
navigation is a position filter designed to be used with
motor vehicles. <br>
When the vehicle&rsquo;s velocity falls below a threshold,
the position and heading are frozen, and velocity is set to
zero. This condition will continue until the computed <br>
velocity rises above 1.2 times the threshold or until the
computed position is at least a set distance from the frozen
place. The threshold velocity and set distance may vary <br>
with software versions.&acirc;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Non-static mode is designed for
use with road navigation software, which often snaps the
reported position to the nearest road within some
uncertainty radius. You probably <br>
want to turn static navigation off for pedestrian use, as it
is likely to report speed zero and position changing in
large jumps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">P <br>
(Direct mode only.) Toggle navigation-parameter display
mode. Toggles between normal display and one that shows
selected navigation parameters from MID 19, including the
<br>
Static Navigation bit toggled by the &rsquo;M&rsquo;
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To interpret what you see, you
will need a copy of the SiRF Binary Protocol Reference
Manual.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">u-blox support <br>
Most information is raw from the GPS. Underlined fields are
derived by translation from ECEF coordinates. 1PPS is the
clock lag as usual. There are no per-type special
commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS AND LIMITATIONS <br>
The PPS Offset field will never be updated when running in
client mode, even if you can see PPS events in the packet
window. This limitation may be fixed in a future
release.</p>
