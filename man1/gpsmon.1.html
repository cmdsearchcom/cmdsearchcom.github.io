gpsmon is a monitor that watches packets coming from a GPS and displays them
  along with diagnostic information. It supports commands that can be used to
  tweak GPS settings in various ways; some are device-independent, some vary
  with the GPS chipset type. It will behave sanely, just dumping packets, when
  connected to a GPS type it knows nothing about.
<div class="Pp"></div>
gpsmon differs from a navigation client in that it mostly dumps raw data from
  the GPS, with only enough data-massaging to allow checks against expected
  output. In particular, this tool does not do any interpolation or modeling to
  derive climb/sink or error estimates. Nor does it discard altitude reports
  when the fix quality is too low.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Unlike gpsd, gpsmon never writes control or probe strings to the device unless
  you explicitly tell it to. Thus, while it will auto-sync to binary packet
  types, it won't automatically reecognize a device shipping an extended NMEA
  protocol as anything other than a plain NMEA device. Use the <b>-t</b> option
  or the <b>t</b> to work around this.
<div class="Pp"></div>
gpsmon is a designed to run in a terminal emulator with a minimum 25x80 size;
  the non-GUI interface is a design choice made to accommodate users operating
  in constrained environments and over telnet or ssh connections. If run in a
  larger window, the size of the packet-log window will be increased to fit.
<div class="Pp"></div>
gpsmon accepts an -h option that displays a usage message, or a -V option to
  dump the package version and exit.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This program may be run in either of two modes, as a client for the gpsd daemon
  (and its associated control socket) or directly connected to a specified
  serial device. When run with no argument, it attempts to connect to the
  daemon. If the argument begins with a server:port specification it will also
  attempt to connect to the daemon. If the argument looks like a bare server
  name it will attempt to connect to a daemon running on the default gpsd port
  on that server. Only if the device argument contains slashes but no colons
  will it be treated as a serial device for direct connection. In direct-connect
  mode gpsmon will hunt for a correct baud rate and lock on to it automatically.
  Possible cases look like this:
<div class="Pp"></div>
localhost:/dev/ttyS1
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Look at the default port of localhost, trying
  both IPv4 and IPv6 and watching output from serial device 1.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
example.com:2317
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Look at port 2317 on example.com, trying both
  IPv4 and IPv6.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
71.162.241.5:2317:/dev/ttyS3
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Look at port 2317 at the specified IPv4
  address, collecting data from attached serial device 3.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
[FEDC:BA98:7654:3210:FEDC:BA98:7654:3210]:2317:/dev/ttyS5
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Look at port 2317 at the specified IPv6
  address, collecting data from attached serial device 5.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Unlike gpsd, gpsmon run in direct mode does not do its own device probing. Thus,
  in particular, if you point it at a GPS with a native binary mode that happens
  to be emitting NMEA, it won't identify the actual type unless the device emits
  a recognizable NMEA trigger sentence. The -t and -i options may help you.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The -F option is only valid in client mode; it specifies a control socket to
  which the program should send device control strings. You must specify a valid
  pathname of a Unix-domain socket on your local filesystem.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The -D option enables packet-getter debugging output and is probably only useful
  to developers of the GPSD code. Consult the packet-getter source code for
  relevant values.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The -L option lists a table showing which GPS device types gpsmon has built-in
  support for, and which generic commands can be applied to which GPS types, and
  then exits. Note that this does not list type-specific commands associated
  with individual GPS types.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The -l option sets up logging to a specified file to start immediately on device
  open. This may be useful is, for example, you want to capture the startup
  message from a device that displays firmware version information there.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The -n option forces gpsmon to request NMEA0183 packets instead of the raw
  datastream from gpsd.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The -t option sets up a fallback type. Give it a string that is a distinguishing
  prefix of exactly one driver type name; this will be used for mode, speed, and
  rate switching if the driver selected by the packet type lacks those
  capabilities. Most useful when the packet type is NMEA but the device is known
  to have a binary mode, such as SiRF binary.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The -a option enables a special debugging mode that does not use screen
  painting. Packets are dumped normally; any character typed suspends packet
  dumping and brings up a command prompt. This feature will mainly be of
  interest to GPSD developers.
<div class="Pp"></div>
After startup (without -a), the top part of the screen reports the contents of
  several especially interesting packet types. The &quot;PPS&quot; field, if
  nonempty, is the delta between the last 1PPS top of second and the system
  clock at that time.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The bottom half of the screen is a scrolling hex dump of all packets the GPS is
  issuing. If the packet type is textual, any trailing CR/LF is omitted. Dump
  lines beginning &gt;&gt;&gt; represent control packets sent to the GPS. Lines
  consisting of &quot;PPS&quot; surrounded by dashes, if present, indicate 1PPS
  and the start of the reporting cycle.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="COMMANDS"><a class="selflink" href="#COMMANDS">COMMANDS</a></h1>
The following device-independent commands are available while gpsmon is running:
<div class="Pp"></div>
i
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">(Direct mode only.) Enable/disable subtype
  probing and reinitialize the driver. In normal operation, gpsmon does not send
  configuration strings to the device (except for wakeup strings needed to get
  it to send data, if any). The command 'i1' causes it to send the same sequence
  of subtype probes that gpsd would. The command 'i0' turns off probing; 'i'
  alone toggles the bit. In either case, the current driver is re-selected; if
  the probe bit is enabled, probes will begin to be issued immediately.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Note that enabling probing might flip the device into another mode; in
  particular, it will flip a SiRF chip into binary mode as if you had used the
  &#x201C;n&#x201D; command. This is due to a limitation in the SiRF firmware
  that we can't fix.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This command will generally do nothing after the first time you use it, because
  the device type will already have been discovered.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
c
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">(Direct mode only.) Change cycle time. Follow
  it with a number interpreted as a cycle time in seconds. Most devices have a
  fixed cycle time of 1 second, so this command may fail with a message.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
l
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Toggle packet logging. If packet logging is
  on, it will be turned off and the log closed. If it is off, logging to the
  filename following the l will be enabled. Differs from simply capturing the
  data from the GPS device in that only whole packets are logged. The logfile is
  opened for append, so you can log more than one portion of the packet stream
  and they will be stitched together correctly.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
n
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">(Direct mode only.) With an argument of 0,
  switch device to NMEA mode at current speed; with an argument of 1, change to
  binary (native) mode. With no argument, toggle the setting. Will show an error
  if the device doesn't have such modes.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
After you switch a dual-protocol GPS to NMEA mode wityh this command, it retains
  the information about the original type and its control capabilities. That is
  why the device type listed before the prompt doesn't change.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
q
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Quit gpsmon. Control-C, or whatever your
  current interrupt character is, works as well.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
s
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">(Direct mode only.) Change baud rate. Follow
  it with a number interpreted as bits per second, for example
  &quot;s9600&quot;. The speed number may optionally be followed by a colon and
  a wordlength-parity-stopbits specification in the traditional style, e.g 8N1
  (the default), 7E1, etc. Some devices don't support serial modes other than
  their default, so this command may fail with a message.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Use this command with caution. On USB and Bluetooth GPSes it is also possible
  for serial mode setting to fail either because the serial adaptor chip does
  not support non-8N1 modes or because the device firmware does not properly
  synchronize the serial adaptor chip with the UART on the GPS chipset when the
  speed changes. These failures can hang your device, possibly requiring a GPS
  power cycle or (in extreme cases) physically disconnecting the NVRAM backup
  battery.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
t
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">(Direct mode only.) Force a switch of
  monitoring type. Follow it with a string that is unique to the name of a gpsd
  driver with gpsmon support; gpsmon will switch to using that driver and
  display code. Will show an error message if there is no matching gpsd driver,
  or multiple matches, or the unique match has no display support in
  gpsmon.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
x
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">(Direct mode only.) Send hex payload to
  device. Following the command letter you may type hex digit pairs; end with a
  newline. These will become the payload of a control packet shipped to the
  device. The packet will be wrapped with headers, trailers, and checksum
  appropriate for the current driver type. The first one or two bytes of the
  payload may be specially interpreted, see the description of the <b>-x</b> of
  <b>gpsctl</b>(1).</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
X
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">(Direct mode only.) Send raw hex bytes to
  device. Following the command letter you may type hex digit pairs; end with a
  newline. These will be shipped to the device.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Ctrl-S
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Freeze display, suspend scrolling in debug
  window.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Ctrl-Q
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Unfreeze display, resume normal
  operation.</div>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="NMEA_support"><a class="selflink" href="#NMEA_support">NMEA

(These remarks apply to not just generic NMEA devices but all extended NMEA
  devices for which gpsmon presently has support.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
All fields are raw data from the GPS except (a) the &quot;Cooked PVT&quot;
  window near top of screen, provided as a check and (b) the &quot;PPS
  offset&quot; field.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There are no device-specific commands. Which generic commands are available may
  vary by type: examine the output of <b>gpsmon -l</b> to learn more.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="SiRF_support"><a class="selflink" href="#SiRF_support">SiRF

Most information is raw from the GPS. Underlined fields are derived by
  translation from ECEF coordinates or application of leap-second and local
  time-zone offsets. 1PPS is the clock lag as usual.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The following commands are supported for SiRF GPSes only:
<div class="Pp"></div>
A
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">(Direct mode only.) Toggle reporting of 50BPS
  subframe data.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
M
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">(Direct mode only.) Set (M1) or clear (M0)
  static navigation. The SiRF documentation says &#x201C;Static navigation is a
  position filter designed to be used with motor vehicles. When the vehicle's
  velocity falls below a threshold, the position and heading are frozen, and
  velocity is set to zero. This condition will continue until the computed
  velocity rises above 1.2 times the threshold or until the computed position is
  at least a set distance from the frozen place. The threshold velocity and set
  distance may vary with software versions.&#x201D;
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Non-static mode is designed for use with road navigation software, which often
  snaps the reported position to the nearest road within some uncertainty
  radius. You probably want to turn static navigation off for pedestrian use, as
  it is likely to report speed zero and position changing in large jumps.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
P
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">(Direct mode only.) Toggle
  navigation-parameter display mode. Toggles between normal display and one that
  shows selected navigation parameters from MID 19, including the Static
  Navigation bit toggled by the 'M' command.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
To interpret what you see, you will need a copy of the SiRF Binary Protocol
  Reference Manual.

The PPS Offset field will never be updated when running in client mode, even if
