<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
vnstatd - daemon based database updating for vnStat</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
vnstatd [ -Ddnpsv? ] [ --alwaysadd ] [ --config file ] [
--daemon ] [ --debug ] [ -g group ] [ --group group ] [
--help ] [ --noadd ] [ --nodaemon ] [ --pidfile file ] [
--sync <br>
] [ --u user ] [ --user user ] [ --version ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The purpose of vnstatd is to provide a more flexible and
robust way for updating vnstat(1) databases than what using
cron for updating can provide. The daemon makes possible
<br>
updating databases more often but at the same time causes
less disk access since data can be cached and written only
later to disk at a user configurable interval. The
availabil&acirc; <br>
ity of each interface is automatically tracked which removes
the need for additional scripts to be implemented and called
when an interface comes online or goes offline.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vnstatd is the command for
starting the daemon. The daemon can either fork itself to
run as a background process or stay attached to the
terminal. It supports logging to a user <br>
selectable file or using syslog.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once started, the daemon will
read vnstat.conf(5) if available and then check if there are
any databases present in the database directory that has
been specified in the configu&acirc; <br>
ration file. By default, if no databases are found, new
databases will be created during startup for all available
interfaces excluding pseudo interfaces lo, lo0 and sit0.
This <br>
automatic database addition behaviour can be disabled using
the --noadd option. Alternatively, it is possible to allow
the daemon to create new databases whenever previously <br>
unseen interfaces become visible using the --alwaysadd
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The daemon will proceed to track
the availability of monitored interfaces, process the
interface traffic statistics and write new values to
databases at a configured interval. As <br>
a result, the daemon ends up spending most of the time
sleeping between updates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
--alwaysadd <br>
Enable automatic creation of new databases for previously
unseen interfaces even if the database directory already
contains databases when the daemon is started. New
data&acirc; <br>
bases will also get created for new interfaces seen while
the daemon is running. Pseudo interfaces lo, lo0 and sit0
are excluded from getting added.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--config file <br>
Use file as configuration file instead of using normal
configuration file search functionality.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --daemon <br>
Fork process to background and run as a daemon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D, --debug <br>
Provide additional output for debug purposes. The process
will stay attached to the terminal for output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g, --group group <br>
Set daemon process group to group during startup. group can
be either the name of the group or a numerical group id.
This option can only be used when the process is <br>
started as root.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--noadd <br>
Disable automatic creation of new databases for all
available interfaces if the daemon is started with zero
database found. Pseudo interfaces lo, lo0 and sit0 are
excluded <br>
from getting added.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --nodaemon <br>
Stay in foreground attached to the current terminal and
start the update process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, --pidfile file <br>
Write the process id to file and use it for locking so that
another instance of the daemon cannot be started if the same
file is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --sync <br>
Synchronize internal counters in the database with interface
counters for all available interfaces before starting
traffic monitoring. Use this option if the traffic <br>
between the previous shutdown and the current startup of the
daemon needs to be ignored. This option isn&rsquo;t required
in normal use because the daemon will automatically <br>
synchronize the internal counters after a system reboot, if
enough time has passed since the daemon was previously
running or if the internal counters are clearly out of <br>
sync.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u, --user user <br>
Set daemon process user to user during startup. user can be
either the login of the user or a numerical user id. This
option can only be used when the process is started <br>
as root.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --version <br>
Show current version of the daemon executable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-?, --help <br>
Show a command option summary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION <br>
The behaviour of the daemon is configured mainly using the
configuration keywords UpdateInterval, PollInterval and
SaveInterval in the configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UpdateInterval defines in
seconds how often the interface data is fetched and updated.
This is similar to the run interval for alternative cron
based updating. However, the <br>
difference is that the data doesn&rsquo;t directly get
written to disk during updates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PollInterval defines in seconds
how often the list of available interfaces is checked for
possible changes. The minimum value is 2 seconds and the
maximum 60 seconds. PollInter&acirc; <br>
val also defines the resolution for other intervals.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SaveInterval defines in minutes
how often cached interface data is written to disk. A write
can only occur during the updating of interface data.
Therefore, the value should be <br>
a multiple of UpdateInterval with a maximum value of 60
minutes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default values of
UpdateInterval 30, SaveInterval 5 and PollInterval 5 are
usually suitable for most systems and provide a similar
behaviour as cron based updating does but <br>
with a better resolution for interface changes and fast
interfaces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For embedded and/or low power
systems more tuned configurations are possible. In such
cases if the interfaces are mostly static the PollInterval
can be increased to around 10-30 <br>
seconds and UpdateInterval set to 60 seconds. Higher values
up to 300 seconds are possible if the interface speed is 10
Mbit or less. SaveInterval can be increased for example <br>
to 15, 30 or even 60 minutes depending on how often the data
needs to be viewed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGNALS <br>
The daemon is listening to signals SIGHUP, SIGINT and
SIGTERM. Sending the SIGHUP signal to the daemon will cause
cached data to be written to disk, a rescan of the database
<br>
directory and a reload of settings from the configuration
file. However, the pid file location will not be changed
even if it&rsquo;s configuration setting has been
modified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGTERM and SIGINT signals will
cause the daemon to write all cached data to disk and then
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/var/lib/vnstat/ <br>
Default database directory. Files are named according to the
monitored interfaces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/vnstat.conf <br>
Config file that will be used unless $HOME/.vnstatrc exists.
See the configuration chapter and vnstat.conf(5) for more
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/var/log/vnstat.log <br>
Log file that will be used if logging to file is enable and
no other file is specified in the config file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/var/run/vnstat.pid <br>
File used for storing the process id if no other file is
specified in the configuration file or using the command
line parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RESTRICTIONS <br>
Updates needs to be executed at least as often as it is
possible for the interface to generate enough traffic to
overflow the kernel interface traffic counter. Otherwise, it
is <br>
possible that some traffic won&rsquo;t be seen. This
isn&rsquo;t an issue for 64-bit kernels but at least one
update every hour is always required in order to provide
proper input. With <br>
32-bit kernels, the maximum time between two updates depends
on how fast the interface can transfer 4 GiB. Calculated
theoretical times are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">10 Mbit: 54 minutes <br>
100 Mbit: 5 minutes <br>
1000 Mbit: 30 seconds</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, for 1000 Mbit
interfaces updating once every minute is usually a usable
solution if faster updates can&rsquo;t be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Virtual and aliased interfaces
cannot be monitored because the kernel doesn&rsquo;t provide
traffic information for that type of interfaces. Such
interfaces are usually named eth0:0, <br>
eth0:1, eth0:2 etc. where eth0 is the actual interface being
aliased.</p>
