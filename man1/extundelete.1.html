<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
extundelete - utility to undelete files from an ext3 or ext4
partition.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
extundelete [options] device-file...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
extundelete is a utility that can recover deleted files from
an ext3 or ext4 partition <br>
extundelete uses the information stored in the
partition&rsquo;s journal to attempt to recover a file that
has been deleted from the partition. <br>
There is no guarantee that any particular file will be able
to be undeleted, so always try to have a good backup system
in place, or at least put one in place after recovering <br>
your files!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
--version <br>
Prints the version number of extundelete.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help Print a brief usage
summary for extundelete.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Partition name <br>
Name of the partition that has deleted files, such as
/dev/sda3. <br>
Could also be the file name of a copy of the partition, such
as that made with dd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--superblock <br>
Prints information about the filesystem from the
superblock.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--journal --superblock <br>
Prints information about the journal from the
journal&rsquo;s superblock.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--inode # <br>
Prints the information from the inode number of the
filesystem given, such as &quot;--inode 2&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--block # <br>
Prints the contents of the block, called as &quot;--block
9652&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--restore-file
path/to/deleted/file <br>
Attempts to restore the file which was deleted at the given
filename, called as &quot;--restore-file
dirname/filename&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--restore-inode # <br>
Used to restore inodes by number, called as
&quot;--restore-inode 2569&quot;. <br>
Also accepts a list of inodes separated by only commas, such
as &quot;--restore-inode 2569,5692,6925&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--restore-files filename <br>
Restores a list of files. First, construct a list of files
in the same style as would be <br>
used in the --restore-file option, and save it to the file
&quot;filename&quot;. <br>
Then, this option may be used to attempt to restore those
files with a single call to extundelete. <br>
This form also reduces redundancy from multiple calls
parsing the journal multiple times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--restore-all <br>
Restores all files possible to undelete to their names
before deletion, when possible. Other files are restored to
a filename like &quot;file.NNNN&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--restore-directory
path/of/directory <br>
Restores all files possible to link to specified directory
to their names before deletion, when possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-j journal_dev <br>
Specifies the device that is the external journal of the
file system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b block_number <br>
Specifies the block number of the backup superblock to be
used when opening the file system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B block_size <br>
Specifies the block size of the partition to be used when
opening the file system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--before date <br>
Only restore files deleted before the date specified, which
should be in the form of the number of seconds since the
UNIX epoch. Use a shell command like <br>
$ date -d &quot;Aug 1 9:02&quot; +%s <br>
to convert a human-readable date to the proper format. The
conversion from the number of seconds to a readable format
may be found by using either of the following: <br>
$ date -d@1234567890 <br>
$ perl -le &quot;print scalar localtime 1234567890&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--after date <br>
Only restore files deleted after the date specified, which
should be in the form of the number of seconds since the
UNIX epoch. <br>
See the notes for the --before option for more
information.</p>
