<p>NCAT(1) Ncat Reference Guide NCAT(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ncat - Concatenate and redirect sockets</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ncat [OPTIONS...] [hostname] [port]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Ncat is a feature-packed networking utility which reads and
writes data across networks from the command line. Ncat was
written for the Nmap Project and is the culmination of the
<br>
currently splintered family of Netcat incarnations. It is
designed to be a reliable back-end tool to instantly provide
network connectivity to other applications and users. Ncat
<br>
will not only work with IPv4 and IPv6 but provides the user
with a virtually limitless number of potential uses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Among Ncat&rsquo;s vast number
of features there is the ability to chain Ncats together;
redirection of TCP, UDP, and SCTP ports to other sites; SSL
support; and proxy connections via <br>
SOCKS4 or HTTP proxies (with optional proxy authentication
as well). Some general principles apply to most applications
and thus give you the capability of instantly adding <br>
networking support to software that would normally never
support it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See the ncat(1) manpage for full
options, descriptions and usage examples</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONNECT MODE AND LISTEN MODE
<br>
Ncat operates in one of two primary modes: connect mode and
listen mode. Other modes, such as the HTTP proxy server, act
as special cases of these two. In connect mode, Ncat <br>
works as a client. In listen mode it is a server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In connect mode, the hostname
and port arguments tell what to connect to. hostname is
required, and may be a hostname or IP address. If port is
supplied, it must be a decimal <br>
port number. If omitted, it defaults to 31337..</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In listen mode, hostname and
port control the address the server will bind to. Both
arguments are optional in listen mode. If hostname is
omitted, it defaults to listening on all <br>
available addresses over IPv4 and IPv6. If port is omitted,
it defaults to 31337.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROTOCOL OPTIONS <br>
-4 (IPv4 only) . <br>
Force the use of IPv4 only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-6 (IPv6 only) . <br>
Force the use of IPv6 only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U, --unixsock (Use Unix domain
sockets) . <br>
Use Unix domain sockets rather than network sockets. This
option may be used on its own for stream sockets, or
combined with --udp for datagram sockets. A description of
-U <br>
mode is in the section called &acirc;UNIX DOMAIN
SOCKETS&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u, --udp (Use UDP) . <br>
Use UDP for the connection (the default is TCP).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--sctp (Use SCTP) . <br>
Use SCTP for the connection (the default is TCP). SCTP
support is implemented in TCP-compatible mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONNECT MODE OPTIONS <br>
-g hop1[,hop2,...] (Loose source routing) . <br>
Sets hops for IPv4 loose source routing. You can use -g once
with a comma-separated list of hops, use -g multiple times
with single hops to build the list, or combine the <br>
two. Hops can be given as IP addresses or hostnames.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-G ptr (Set source routing
pointer) . <br>
Sets the IPv4 source route &acirc;pointer&acirc; for use
with -g. The argument must be a multiple of 4 and no more
than 28. Not all operating systems support setting this
pointer to <br>
anything other than four.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p port, --source-port port
(Specify source port) . <br>
Set the port number for Ncat to bind to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s host, --source host (Specify
source address) . <br>
Set the address for Ncat to bind to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LISTEN MODE OPTIONS <br>
See the section called &acirc;ACCESS CONTROL OPTIONS&acirc;
for information on limiting the hosts that may connect to
the listening Ncat process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, --listen (Listen for
connections) . <br>
Listen for connections rather than connecting to a remote
machine</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m numconns, --max-conns
numconns (Specify maximum number of connections) . <br>
The maximum number of simultaneous connections accepted by
an Ncat instance. 100 is the default (60 on Windows).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k, --keep-open (Accept multiple
connections) . <br>
Normally a listening server accepts only one connection and
then quits when the connection is closed. This option makes
it accept multiple simultaneous connections and wait <br>
for more connections after they have all been closed. It
must be combined with --listen. In this mode there is no way
for Ncat to know when its network input is finished, so <br>
it will keep running until interrupted. This also means that
it will never close its output stream, so any program
reading from Ncat and looking for end-of-file will also <br>
hang.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--broker (Connection brokering)
. <br>
Allow multiple parties to connect to a centralised Ncat
server and communicate with each other. Ncat can broker
communication between systems that are behind a NAT or <br>
otherwise unable to directly connect. This option is used in
conjunction with --listen, which causes the --listen port to
have broker mode enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--chat (Ad-hoc &acirc;chat
server&acirc;) . <br>
The --chat option enables chat mode, intended for the
exchange of text between several users. In chat mode,
connection brokering is turned on. Ncat prefixes each
message <br>
received with an ID before relaying it to the other
connections. The ID is unique for each connected client.
This helps distinguish who sent what. Additionally,
non-printing <br>
characters such as control characters are escaped to keep
them from doing damage to a terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SSL OPTIONS <br>
--ssl (Use SSL) . <br>
In connect mode, this option transparently negotiates an SSL
session with an SSL server to securely encrypt the
connection. This is particularly handy for talking to SSL
<br>
enabled HTTP servers, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In server mode, this option
listens for incoming SSL connections, rather than plain
untunneled traffic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ssl-verify (Verify server
certificates) . <br>
In client mode, --ssl-verify is like --ssl except that it
also requires verification of the server certificate. Ncat
comes with a default set of trusted certificates in the <br>
file ca-bundle.crt. --ssl-trustfile to give a custom list.
Use -v one or more times to get details about verification
failures. Ncat does not check for revoked <br>
certificates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option has no effect in
server mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ssl-cert certfile.pem (Specify
SSL certificate) . <br>
This option gives the location of a PEM-encoded certificate
files used to authenticate the server (in listen mode) or
the client (in connect mode). Use it in combination with
<br>
--ssl-key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ssl-key keyfile.pem (Specify
SSL private key) . <br>
This option gives the location of the PEM-encoded private
key file that goes with the certificate named with
--ssl-cert.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ssl-trustfile cert.pem (List
trusted certificates) . <br>
This option sets a list of certificates that are trusted for
purposes of certificate verification. It has no effect
unless combined with --ssl-verify. The argument to this <br>
option is the name of a PEM. file containing trusted
certificates. Typically, the file will contain certificates
of certification authorities, though it may also contain
<br>
server certificates directly. When this option is used, Ncat
does not use its default certificates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROXY OPTIONS <br>
--proxy host[:port] (Specify proxy address) . <br>
Requests proxying through host:port, using the protocol
specified by --proxy-type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no port is specified, the
proxy protocol&rsquo;s well-known port is used (1080 for
SOCKS and 3128 for HTTP). However, when specifying an IPv6
HTTP proxy server using the IP <br>
address rather than the hostname, the port number MUST be
specified as well. If the proxy requires authentication, use
--proxy-auth.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--proxy-type proto (Specify
proxy protocol) . <br>
In connect mode, this option requests the protocol proto to
connect through the proxy host specified by --proxy. In
listen mode, this option has Ncat act as a proxy server <br>
using the specified protocol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The currently available
protocols in connect mode are http (CONNECT) and socks4
(SOCKSv4). The only server currently supported is http. If
this option is not used, the <br>
default protocol is http.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--proxy-auth user[:pass]
(Specify proxy credentials) . <br>
In connect mode, gives the credentials that will be used to
connect to the proxy server. In listen mode, gives the
credentials that will be required of connecting clients.
<br>
For use with --proxy-type http, the form should be
user:pass. For --proxy-type socks4, it should be a username
only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMAND EXECUTION OPTIONS <br>
-e command, --exec command (Execute command) . <br>
Execute the specified command after a connection has been
established. The command must be specified as a full
pathname. All input from the remote client will be sent to
the <br>
application and responses sent back to the remote client
over the socket, thus making your command-line application
interactive over a socket. Combined with --keep-open, Ncat
<br>
will handle multiple simultaneous connections to your
specified port/application like inetd. Ncat will only accept
a maximum, definable, number of simultaneous connections
<br>
controlled by the -m option. By default this is set to 100
(60 on Windows).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c command, --sh-exec command
(Execute command via sh) . <br>
Same as -e, except it tries to execute the command via
/bin/sh. This means you don&rsquo;t have to specify the full
path for the command, and shell facilities like environment
<br>
variables are available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--lua-exec file (Execute a .lua
script) . <br>
Runs the specified file as a Lua script after a connection
has been established, using a built-in interpreter. Both the
script&rsquo;s standard input and the standard output are
<br>
redirected to the connection data streams.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ACCESS CONTROL OPTIONS <br>
--allow host[,host,...] (Allow connections) . <br>
The list of hosts specified will be the only hosts allowed
to connect to the Ncat process. All other connection
attempts will be disconnected. In case of a conflict between
<br>
--allow and --deny, --allow takes precedence. Host
specifications follow the same syntax used by Nmap.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--allowfile file (Allow
connections from file) . <br>
This has the same functionality as --allow, except that the
allowed hosts are provided in a new-line delimited allow
file, rather than directly on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--deny host[,host,...] (Deny
connections) . <br>
Issue Ncat with a list of hosts that will not be allowed to
connect to the listening Ncat process. Specified hosts will
have their session silently terminated if they try to <br>
connect. In case of a conflict between --allow and --deny,
--allow takes precedence. Host specifications follow the
same syntax used by Nmap.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--denyfile file (Deny
connections from file) . <br>
This is the same functionality as --deny, except that
excluded hosts are provided in a new-line delimited deny
file, rather than directly on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TIMING OPTIONS <br>
These options accept a time parameter. This is specified in
seconds by default, though you can append ms, s, m, or h to
the value to specify milliseconds, seconds, minutes, or <br>
hours.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d time, --delay time (Specify
line delay) . <br>
Set the delay interval for lines sent. This effectively
limits the number of lines that Ncat will send in the
specified period. This may be useful for low-bandwidth
sites, or <br>
have other uses such as coping with annoying iptables
--limit options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i time, --idle-timeout time
(Specify idle timeout) . <br>
Set a fixed timeout for idle connections. If the idle
timeout is reached, the connection is terminated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w time, --wait time (Specify
connect timeout) . <br>
Set a fixed timeout for connection attempts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT OPTIONS <br>
-o file, --output file (Save session data) . <br>
Dump session data to a file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x file, --hex-dump file (Save
session data in hex) . <br>
Dump session data in hex to a file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--append-output (Append output)
. <br>
Issue Ncat with --append-ouput along with -o and/or -x and
it will append the resulted output rather than truncating
the specified output files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose (Be verbose) .
<br>
Issue Ncat with -v and it will be verbose and display all
kinds of useful connection based information. Use more than
once (-vv, -vvv...) for greater verbosity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MISC OPTIONS <br>
-C, --crlf (Use CRLF as EOL) . <br>
This option tells Ncat to convert LF. line endings to CRLF.
when taking input from standard input.. This is useful for
talking to some stringent servers directly from a <br>
terminal in one of the many common plain-text protocols that
use CRLF for end-of-line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help (Help screen) . <br>
Displays a short help screen with common options and
parameters, and then exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--recv-only (Only receive data)
. <br>
If this option is passed, Ncat will only receive data and
will not try to send anything.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--send-only (Only send data) .
<br>
If this option is passed, then Ncat will only send data and
will ignore anything received. This option also causes Ncat
to close the network connection and terminate after <br>
EOF is received on standard input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t, --telnet (Answer Telnet
negotiations) . <br>
Handle DO/DONT WILL/WONT Telnet negotiations. This makes it
possible to script Telnet sessions with Ncat.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version (Display version) .
<br>
Displays the Ncat version number and exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UNIX DOMAIN SOCKETS <br>
The -U option (same as --unixsock) causes Ncat to use Unix
domain sockets rather than network sockets. Unix domain
sockets exist as an entry in the filesystem. You must give
the <br>
name of a socket to connect to or to listen on. For example,
to make a connection,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ncat -U ~/unixsock</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To listen on a socket:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ncat -l -U ~/unixsock</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Listen mode will create the
socket if it doesn&rsquo;t exist. The socket will continue
to exist after the program ends.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Both stream and datagram domain
sockets are supported. Use -U on its own for stream sockets,
or combine it with --udp for datagram sockets. Datagram
sockets require a source <br>
socket to connect from. By default, a source socket with a
random filename will be created as needed, and deleted when
the program ends. Use the --source with a path to use a <br>
source socket with a specific name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Connect to example.org on TCP port 8080. <br>
ncat example.org 8080</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Listen for connections on TCP
port 8080. <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT CODE <br>
The exit code reflects whether a connection was made and
completed successfully. 0 means there was no error. 1 means
there was a network error of some kind, for example <br>
&acirc;Connection refused&acirc; or &acirc;Connection
reset&acirc;. 2 is reserved for all other errors, like an
invalid option or a nonexistent file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Like its authors, Ncat isn&rsquo;t perfect. But you can help
make it better by sending bug reports or even writing
patches. If Ncat doesn&rsquo;t behave the way you expect,
first upgrade to <br>
the latest version available from http://nmap.org. If the
problem persists, do some research to determine whether it
has already been discovered and addressed. Try Googling the
<br>
error message or browsing the nmap-dev archives at
http://seclists.org/. Read this full manual page as well. If
nothing comes of this, mail a bug report to
&lt;dev@nmap.org&gt;. <br>
Please include everything you have learned about the
problem, as well as what version of Ncat you are running and
what operating system version it is running on. Problem
reports <br>
and Ncat usage questions sent to dev@nmap.org are far more
likely to be answered than those sent to Fyodor
directly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Code patches to fix bugs are
even better than bug reports. Basic instructions for
creating patch files with your changes are available at
https://svn.nmap.org/nmap/HACKING. <br>
Patches may be sent to nmap-dev (recommended) or to Fyodor
directly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Inappropriate Usage <br>
Ncat should never be installed with special privileges (e.g.
suid root).. That would open up a major security
vulnerability as other users on the system (or attackers)
could use <br>
it for privilege escalation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Third-Party Software <br>
This product includes software developed by the Apache
Software Foundation[2]. A modified version of the Libpcap
portable packet capture library[3]. is distributed along
with <br>
Ncat. The Windows version of Ncat utilized the
Libpcap-derived WinPcap library[4]. instead. Certain raw
networking functions use the Libdnet[5]. networking library,
which was <br>
written by Dug Song.. A modified version is distributed with
Ncat. Ncat can optionally link with the OpenSSL cryptography
toolkit[6]. for SSL version detection support. All of <br>
the third-party software described in this paragraph is
freely redistributable under BSD-style software
licenses.</p>
