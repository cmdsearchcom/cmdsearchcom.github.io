<p>SYSLINUX(1) General Commands Manual SYSLINUX(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
syslinux - install the SYSLINUX bootloader on a FAT
filesystem</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
syslinux [OPTIONS] device</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Syslinux is a boot loader for the Linux operating system
which operates off an MS-DOS/Windows FAT filesystem. It is
intended to simplify first-time installation of Linux, and
for <br>
creation of rescue and other special-purpose boot disks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to create a bootable
Linux floppy using Syslinux, prepare a normal MS-DOS
formatted floppy. Copy one or more Linux kernel files to it,
then execute the command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">syslinux --install /dev/fd0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This will alter the boot sector
on the disk and copy a file named ldlinux.sys into its root
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On boot time, by default, the
kernel will be loaded from the image named LINUX on the boot
floppy. This default can be changed, see the section on the
syslinux configuration <br>
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the Shift or Alt keys are
held down during boot, or the Caps or Scroll locks are set,
syslinux will display a lilo(8) -style &quot;boot:&quot;
prompt. The user can then type a kernel <br>
file name followed by any kernel parameters. The SYSLINUX
bootloader does not need to know about the kernel file in
advance; all that is required is that it is a file located
in <br>
the root directory on the disk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Syslinux supports the loading of
initial ramdisks (initrd) and the bzImage kernel format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-i, --install <br>
Install SYSLINUX on a new medium, overwriting any previously
installed bootloader.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U, --update <br>
Install SYSLINUX on a new medium if and only if a version of
SYSLINUX is already installed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --stupid <br>
Install a &quot;safe, slow and stupid&quot; version of
SYSLINUX. This version may work on some very buggy BIOSes on
which SYSLINUX would otherwise fail. If you find a machine
on <br>
which the -s option is required to make it boot reliably,
please send as much info about your machine as you can, and
include the failure mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, --force <br>
Force install even if it appears unsafe.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, --raid <br>
RAID mode. If boot fails, tell the BIOS to boot the next
device in the boot sequence (usually the next hard disk)
instead of stopping with an error message. This is
use&acirc; <br>
ful for RAID-1 booting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --directory subdirectory
<br>
Install the SYSLINUX control files in a subdirectory with
the specified name (relative to the root directory on the
device).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t, --offset offset <br>
Indicates that the filesystem is at an offset from the base
of the device or file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--once command <br>
Declare a boot command to be tried on the first boot
only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O, --clear-once <br>
Clear the boot-once command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H, --heads head-count <br>
Override the detected number of heads for the geometry.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S, --sectors sector-count <br>
Override the detected number of sectors for the
geometry.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z, --zipdrive <br>
Assume zipdrive geometry (--heads 64 --sectors 32).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--reset-adv <br>
Reset auxilliary data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M, --menu-save <br>
Set the label to select as default on the next boot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
Configuration file <br>
All the configurable defaults in SYSLINUX can be changed by
putting a file called syslinux.cfg in the install directory
of the boot disk. This is a text file in either UNIX or <br>
DOS format, containing one or more of the following items
(case is insensitive for keywords).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This list is out of date.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the configuration file blank
lines and comment lines beginning with a hash mark (#) are
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">default kernel [ options ... ]
<br>
Sets the default command line. If syslinux boots
automatically, it will act just as if the entries after
&quot;default&quot; had been typed in at the
&quot;boot:&quot; prompt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no DEFAULT or UI statement is
found, or the configuration file is missing entirely,
SYSLINUX drops to the boot: prompt with an error message (if
NOESCAPE is set, it <br>
stops with a &quot;boot failed&quot; message; this is also
the case for PXELINUX if the configuration file is not
found.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: Until SYSLINUX 3.85, if no
configuration file is present, or no <br>
&quot;default&quot; entry is present in the configuration
file, the default is &quot;linux auto&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Even earlier versions of
SYSLINUX used to automatically <br>
append the string &quot;auto&quot; to whatever the user
specified using the DEFAULT command. As of version 1.54,
this is no longer true, as it caused problems when using a
shell as <br>
a substitute for &quot;init.&quot; You may want to include
this option manually.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">append options ... <br>
Add one or more options to the kernel command line. These
are added both for automatic and manual boots. The options
are added at the very beginning of the kernel command <br>
line, usually permitting explicitly entered kernel options
to override them. This is the equivalent of the lilo(8) <br>
&quot;append&quot; option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">label label <br>
kernel image <br>
append options ... <br>
Indicates that if label is entered as the kernel to boot,
syslinux should instead boot image, and the specified
&quot;append&quot; options should be used instead of the
ones speci&acirc; <br>
fied in the global section of the file (before the first
&quot;label&quot; command.) The default for image is the
same as label, and if no &quot;append&quot; is given the
default is to use <br>
the global entry (if any). Use &quot;append -&quot; to use
no options at all. Up to 128 &quot;label&quot; entries are
permitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;image&quot;
doesn&rsquo;t have to be a Linux kernel; it can be a boot
sector or a COMBOOT file (see below.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">implicit flag_val <br>
If flag_val is 0, do not load a kernel image unless it has
been explicitly named in a &quot;label&quot; statement. The
default is 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">timeout timeout <br>
Indicates how long to wait at the &quot;boot:&quot; prompt
until booting automatically, in units of 1/10 s. The timeout
is cancelled as soon as the user types anything on the
key&acirc; <br>
board, the assumption being that the user will complete the
command line already begun. A timeout of zero will disable
the timeout completely, this is also the default. <br>
The maximum possible timeout value is 35996; corresponding
to just below one hour.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">serial port [ baudrate ] <br>
Enables a serial port to act as the console.
&quot;port&quot; is a number (0 = /dev/ttyS0 = COM1, etc.);
if &quot;baudrate&quot; is omitted, the baud rate defaults
to 9600 bps. The serial <br>
parameters are hardcoded to be 8 bits, no parity, 1 stop
bit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For this directive to be
guaranteed to work properly, it should be the first
directive in the configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">font filename <br>
Load a font in .psf format before displaying any output
(except the copyright line, which is output as ldlinux.sys
itself is loaded.) syslinux only loads the font onto the
<br>
video card; if the .psf file contains a Unicode table it is
ignored. This only works on EGA and VGA cards; hopefully it
should do nothing on others.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kbdmap keymap <br>
Install a simple keyboard map. The keyboard remapper used is
very simplistic (it simply remaps the keycodes received from
the BIOS, which means that only the key combina&acirc; <br>
tions relevant in the default layout - usually U.S. English
- can be mapped) but should at least help people with AZERTY
keyboard layout and the locations of = and , (two <br>
special characters used heavily on the Linux kernel command
line.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The included program
keytab-lilo.pl(8) from the lilo(8) <br>
distribution can be used to create such keymaps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">display filename <br>
Displays the indicated file on the screen at boot time
(before the boot: prompt, if displayed). Please see the
section below on DISPLAY files. If the file is missing, this
<br>
option is simply ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">prompt flag_val <br>
If flag_val is 0, display the &quot;boot:&quot; prompt only
if the Shift or Alt key is pressed, or Caps Lock or Scroll
lock is set (this is the default). If flag_val is 1, always
<br>
display the &quot;boot:&quot; prompt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f1 filename <br>
f2 filename <br>
... <br>
f9 filename <br>
f10 filename <br>
f11 filename <br>
f12 filename <br>
Displays the indicated file on the screen when a function
key is pressed at the &quot;boot:&quot; prompt. This can be
used to implement pre-boot online help (presumably for the
ker&acirc; <br>
nel command line options.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When using the serial console,
press &lt;Ctrl-F&gt;&lt;digit&gt; to get to the help
screens, e.g. &lt;Ctrl-F&gt;2 to get to the f2 screen. For
f10-f12, hit &lt;Ctrl-F&gt;A, &lt;Ctrl-F&gt;B,
&lt;Ctrl-F&gt;C. <br>
For compatiblity with earlier versions, f10 can also be
entered as &lt;Ctrl-F&gt;0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Display file format <br>
DISPLAY and function-key help files are text files in either
DOS or UNIX format (with or without &lt;CR&gt;). In
addition, the following special codes are interpreted:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;FF&gt; = &lt;Ctrl-L&gt; =
ASCII 12 <br>
Clear the screen, home the cursor. Note that the screen is
filled with the current display color.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;SI&gt;&lt;bg&gt;&lt;fg&gt;,
&lt;SI&gt; = &lt;Ctrl-O&gt; = ASCII 15 <br>
Set the display colors to the specified background and
foreground colors, where &lt;bg&gt; and &lt;fg&gt; are hex
digits, corresponding to the standard PC display
attributes:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 = black 8 = dark grey <br>
1 = dark blue 9 = bright blue <br>
2 = dark green a = bright green <br>
3 = dark cyan b = bright cyan <br>
4 = dark red c = bright red <br>
5 = dark purple d = bright purple <br>
6 = brown e = yellow <br>
7 = light grey f = white</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Picking a bright color (8-f) for
the background results in the corresponding dark color
(0-7), with the foreground flashing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">colors are not visible over the
serial console.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;CAN&gt;filename&lt;newline&gt;,
&lt;CAN&gt; = &lt;Ctrl-X&gt; = ASCII 24 <br>
If a VGA display is present, enter graphics mode and display
the graphic included in the specified file. The file format
is an ad hoc format called LSS16; the included <br>
Perl program &quot;ppmtolss16&quot; can be used to produce
these images. This Perl program also includes the file
format specification.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The image is displayed in
640x480 16-color mode. Once in graphics mode, the display
attributes (set by &lt;SI&gt; code sequences) work slightly
differently: the background <br>
color is ignored, and the foreground colors are the 16
colors specified in the image file. For that reason,
ppmtolss16 allows you to specify that certain colors should
be <br>
assigned to specific color indicies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Color indicies 0 and 7, in
particular, should be chosen with care: 0 is the background
color, and 7 is the color used for the text printed by
SYSLINUX itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;EM&gt;, &lt;EM&gt; =
&lt;Ctrl-U&gt; = ASCII 25 <br>
If we are currently in graphics mode, return to text
mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;DLE&gt;..&lt;ETB&gt;,
&lt;Ctrl-P&gt;..&lt;Ctrl-W&gt; = ASCII 16-23 <br>
These codes can be used to select which modes to print a
certain part of the message file in. Each of these control
characters select a specific set of modes (text <br>
screen, graphics screen, serial port) for which the output
is actually displayed:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Character Text Graph Serial <br>
------------------------------------------------------ <br>
&lt;DLE&gt; = &lt;Ctrl-P&gt; = ASCII 16 No No No <br>
&lt;DC1&gt; = &lt;Ctrl-Q&gt; = ASCII 17 Yes No No <br>
&lt;DC2&gt; = &lt;Ctrl-R&gt; = ASCII 18 No Yes No <br>
&lt;DC3&gt; = &lt;Ctrl-S&gt; = ASCII 19 Yes Yes No <br>
&lt;DC4&gt; = &lt;Ctrl-T&gt; = ASCII 20 No No Yes <br>
&lt;NAK&gt; = &lt;Ctrl-U&gt; = ASCII 21 Yes No Yes <br>
&lt;SYN&gt; = &lt;Ctrl-V&gt; = ASCII 22 No Yes Yes <br>
&lt;ETB&gt; = &lt;Ctrl-W&gt; = ASCII 23 Yes Yes Yes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example: <br>
&lt;DC1&gt;Text mode&lt;DC2&gt;Graphics
mode&lt;DC4&gt;Serial port&lt;ETB&gt; <br>
... will actually print out which mode the console is
in!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;SUB&gt; = &lt;Ctrl-Z&gt; =
ASCII 26 <br>
End of file (DOS convention).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Comboot Images and other
operating systems <br>
This version of syslinux supports chain loading of other
operating systems (such as MS-DOS and its derivatives,
including Windows 95/98), as well as COMBOOT-style
standalone exe&acirc; <br>
cutables (a subset of DOS .COM files; see separate section
below.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Chain loading requires the boot
sector of the foreign operating system to be stored in a
file in the root directory of the filesystem. Because
neither Linux kernels, boot sector <br>
images, nor COMBOOT files have reliable magic numbers,
syslinux will look at the file extension. The following
extensions are recognised:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">none or other Linux kernel image
<br>
CBT COMBOOT image (not runnable from DOS) <br>
BSS Boot sector (DOS superblock will be patched in) <br>
BS Boot sector <br>
COM COMBOOT image (runnable from DOS)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For filenames given on the
command line, syslinux will search for the file by adding
extensions in the order listed above if the plain filename
is not found. Filenames in KERNEL <br>
statements must be fully qualified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A COMBOOT file is a standalone
executable in DOS .COM format. They can, among other things,
be produced by the Etherboot package by Markus Gutschke and
Ken Yap. The following <br>
requirements apply for these files to be sufficiently
&quot;standalone&quot; for syslinux to be able to load and
run them:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The program must
not execute any DOS calls (since there is no DOS), although
it may call the BIOS. The only exception is that the program
may execute INT 20h (Terminate <br>
Program) to return to the syslinux prompt. Note especially
that INT 21h AH=4Ch, INT 21h AH=31h or INT 27h are not
supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Only the fields
pspInt20 at offset 00h, pspNextParagraph at offset 02h and
pspCommandTail at offset 80h (contains the arguments from
the syslinux command line) in the PSP <br>
are supported. All other fields will contain zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The program must
not modify any main memory outside its 64K segment if it
returns to syslinux via INT 20h.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Syslinux currently doesn&rsquo;t
provide any form of API for the use of COMBOOT files. If
there is need, a future version may contain an INT interface
to some syslinux functions; <br>
please contact me if you have a need or ideas for such an
API.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Novice protection <br>
Syslinux will attempt to detect if the user is trying to
boot on a 286 or lower class machine, or a machine with less
than 608K of low (&quot;DOS&quot;) RAM (which means the
Linux boot <br>
sequence cannot complete). If so, a message is displayed and
the boot sequence aborted. Holding down the Ctrl key while
booting disables this feature.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The compile time and date of a
specific syslinux version can be obtained by the DOS command
&quot;type ldlinux.sys&quot;. This is also used as the
signature for the LDLINUX.SYS file, which <br>
must match the boot sector</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any file that syslinux uses can
be marked hidden, system or readonly if so is convenient;
syslinux ignores all file attributes. The SYSLINUX installed
automatically sets the <br>
readonly attribute on LDLINUX.SYS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bootable CD-ROMs <br>
SYSLINUX can be used to create bootdisk images for El
Torito-compatible bootable CD-ROMs. However, it appears that
many BIOSes are very buggy when it comes to booting CD-ROMs.
<br>
Some users have reported that the following steps are
helpful in making a CD-ROM that is bootable on the largest
possible number of machines:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Use the -s
(safe, slow and stupid) option to SYSLINUX</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Put the boot
image as close to the beginning of the ISO 9660 filesystem
as possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A CD-ROM is so much faster than
a floppy that the -s option shouldn&rsquo;t matter from a
speed perspective.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Of course, you probably want to
use ISOLINUX instead. See the documentation file
isolinux.doc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Booting from a FAT partition on
a hard disk <br>
SYSLINUX can boot from a FAT filesystem partition on a hard
disk (including FAT32). The installation procedure is
identical to the procedure for installing it on a floppy,
and <br>
should work under either DOS or Linux. To boot from a
partition, SYSLINUX needs to be launched from a Master Boot
Record or another boot loader, just like DOS itself would. A
<br>
sample master boot sector (mbr.bin) is included with
SYSLINUX.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
I would appreciate hearing of any problems you have with
SYSLINUX. I would also like to hear from you if you have
successfully used SYSLINUX, especially if you are using it
for <br>
a distribution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are reporting problems,
please include all possible information about your system
and your BIOS; the vast majority of all problems reported
turn out to be BIOS or hardware <br>
bugs, and I need as much information as possible in order to
diagnose the problems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is a mailing list for
discussion among SYSLINUX users and for announcements of new
and test versions. To join, send a message to
majordomo@linux.kernel.org with the line:</p>
