<b>abcmatch</b> is used to search for specific sequences of notes in an abc file
  composed of many tunes. For example, if you know a few bars of a tune, you can
  use this program to find the tune having this sequence and perhaps identify
  the tune. At a minimum, abcmatch requires two files. A template file called
  match.abc which contains the bars that you are searching for and a large file
  consisting of a hundred or more abc tunes. The program automatically loads up
  the match.abc file and then scans every tune in the large file

  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-v and -c</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">mainly used for debugging when the program does not do what
      was expected.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-ver</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">prints version number and then exits</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>--norhythm</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Causes the matching algorithm to ignore the length of notes
      in a bar, thus E3/2F/D GA2 would match EFD G2A. The option ignores -r
      parameter since it is now irrelevant.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-pitch_table</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Used to produce a interval weighted pitch histogram for
      each tune in the file. If this is saved in an external file, that file
      could be used as a database for finding tunes with similar pitch
      probability density functions (pdf).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-r</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Controls how the matching criterion handles small rhythm
      variations in the melody. The -r option must be followed by a number which
      specifies the temporal resolution for the match. When the number is zero,
      this indicates that a perfect match should be performed, meaning that the
      lengths of each note in the bar must match exactly in order to be
      reported. For larger values a looser match will be performed as described
      below. Note lengths are converted into temporal units where a quarter note
      normally is assigned a value of 24. Therefore an eight note has a value of
      12, a sixteenth has a value of 6, a half note has a value of 48 and etc.
      If you specify a temporal resolution of 12, then the pitch values of the
      notes only need to match at time units which are multiples of an eighth
      note.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-fixed n</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Causes the program to disregard bar lines when does the
      matching. It allows matching of notes between tunes having different time
      signatures. n is a number which specifies the exact number of notes to
      match. For example if n is 4, the program could match |C E G E| .. with |C
      E|G E| Note the matcher still starts at a beginning of a given bar for
      both the tune and template.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-con</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Specifies contour matching. In this case, the program uses
      the key signature only to indicate accidentals. The pitch contour is
      computed from the pitch difference or interval between adjacent
    notes.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-qnt</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Uses the contour matching algorithm but also quantizes the
      intervals using the following table:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    unison and semitone 0 minor 2nd to major 2nd 1 minor 3rd to major 3rd 2 any
      larger interval 3
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Negative numbers are descending intervals.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-tp file name, reference number</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Substitute any tune for the template match.abc. When using
      this feature, the entire tune is used as a template. Abcmatch does not
      match the template with itself, and only bars which match bars in other
      tunes are reported.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-br threshold</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Runs the program in a brief mode designed to identify
      groups of tunes sharing common bars. In this mode, the program counts the
      numbers of bars in the test tune which are also present in match.abc. If
      the number of common bars is larger or equal to the threshold then the
      program reports the tune and the number of common bars. The program scans
      all the tunes in the abc file and returns a list of all the tunes which
      have more than a specific number of bars in common with the template,
      match.abc. In actual use, the program is run repeatedly by a script. For
      each tune in a abc file, it creates a template file called match.abc and
      then executes abcmatch. The outputs are displayed on the screen in a form
      easy to interpret. The user has no control of the matching criterion. The
      rhythm must match exactly and the notes are transposed to suit the key
      signature. In other words the -r parameter is independent of what is
      specified in the parameter list.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-pitch_hist or -length_hist</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Runs the program in another mode. It produces a histogram
      of the distribution of the notes in the abc file. The pitch is indicated
      in midi units. Thus middle C is 60 and the pitches go up in semitone
      units. Following the pitch is a count of the number of times that note
      occurred.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-pitch_table or -interval_table</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Used to create a database for a collection of tunes in a
      file for future analysis.
