<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
abcmatch - Search for specific sequences of notes in an abc
file composed of many tunes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
abcmatch abc file [-c] [-v] [-r] [-con] [-fixed nn] [-qnt]
[-lev] [-a] [-ign] [-br %d] [-tp abc reference file] [-ver]
[-pitch_hist] [-wpitch_hist] [-length_hist] <br>
[-interval_hist] [-pitch_table] [-interval_table] reference
number</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
abcmatch is used to search for specific sequences of notes
in an abc file composed of many tunes. For example, if you
know a few bars of a tune, you can use this program to <br>
find the tune having this sequence and perhaps identify the
tune. At a minimum, abcmatch requires two files. A template
file called match.abc which contains the bars that you <br>
are searching for and a large file consisting of a hundred
or more abc tunes. The program automatically loads up the
match.abc file and then scans every tune in the large
file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-v and -c <br>
mainly used for debugging when the program does not do what
was expected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ver prints version number and
then exits</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--norhythm <br>
Causes the matching algorithm to ignore the length of notes
in a bar, thus E3/2F/D GA2 would match EFD G2A. The option
ignores -r parameter since it is now irrelevant.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pitch_table <br>
Used to produce a interval weighted pitch histogram for each
tune in the file. If this is saved in an external file, that
file could be used as a database for finding <br>
tunes with similar pitch probability density functions
(pdf).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Controls how the matching
criterion handles small rhythm variations in the melody. The
-r option must be followed by a number which specifies the
temporal resolution for <br>
the match. When the number is zero, this indicates that a
perfect match should be performed, meaning that the lengths
of each note in the bar must match exactly in order <br>
to be reported. For larger values a looser match will be
performed as described below. Note lengths are converted
into temporal units where a quarter note normally is <br>
assigned a value of 24. Therefore an eight note has a value
of 12, a sixteenth has a value of 6, a half note has a value
of 48 and etc. If you specify a temporal resolu&acirc; <br>
tion of 12, then the pitch values of the notes only need to
match at time units which are multiples of an eighth
note.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fixed n <br>
Causes the program to disregard bar lines when does the
matching. It allows matching of notes between tunes having
different time signatures. n is a number which speci&acirc;
<br>
fies the exact number of notes to match. For example if n is
4, the program could match |C E G E| .. with |C E|G E| Note
the matcher still starts at a beginning of a given <br>
bar for both the tune and template.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-con Specifies contour matching.
In this case, the program uses the key signature only to
indicate accidentals. The pitch contour is computed from the
pitch difference or <br>
interval between adjacent notes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-qnt Uses the contour matching
algorithm but also quantizes the intervals using the
following table:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unison and semitone 0 minor 2nd
to major 2nd 1 minor 3rd to major 3rd 2 any larger interval
3</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Negative numbers are descending
intervals.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-tp file name, reference number
<br>
Substitute any tune for the template match.abc. When using
this feature, the entire tune is used as a template.
Abcmatch does not match the template with itself, and only
<br>
bars which match bars in other tunes are reported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-br threshold <br>
Runs the program in a brief mode designed to identify groups
of tunes sharing common bars. In this mode, the program
counts the numbers of bars in the test tune which are <br>
also present in match.abc. If the number of common bars is
larger or equal to the threshold then the program reports
the tune and the number of common bars. The program <br>
scans all the tunes in the abc file and returns a list of
all the tunes which have more than a specific number of bars
in common with the template, match.abc. In actual <br>
use, the program is run repeatedly by a script. For each
tune in a abc file, it creates a template file called
match.abc and then executes abcmatch. The outputs are
dis&acirc; <br>
played on the screen in a form easy to interpret. The user
has no control of the matching criterion. The rhythm must
match exactly and the notes are transposed to suit the <br>
key signature. In other words the -r parameter is
independent of what is specified in the parameter list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pitch_hist or -length_hist <br>
Runs the program in another mode. It produces a histogram of
the distribution of the notes in the abc file. The pitch is
indicated in midi units. Thus middle C is 60 and <br>
the pitches go up in semitone units. Following the pitch is
a count of the number of times that note occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pitch_table or -interval_table
<br>
Used to create a database for a collection of tunes in a
file for future analysis.</p>
