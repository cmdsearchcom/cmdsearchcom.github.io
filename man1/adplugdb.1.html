<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
adplugdb - AdPlug database maintenance utility</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
adplugdb [OPTION]... COMMAND [ARGUMENT]...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
adplugdb maintains database files in AdPlug database format.
It can add, list and remove records within a central
database, or merge a set of databases together into one
single <br>
database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">adplugdb always operates on a
central database file. The location of this database file is
determined by first checking if the user has a home
directory. If a home directory is <br>
present, the database file will be located in
~/.adplug/adplug.db. If a home directory is not present, a
database file adplug.db will be looked for in the current
working direc&acirc; <br>
tory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A system-wide database file can
be used instead, by specifying the -s commandline option.
The system-wide database file is located in
/usr/com/adplug/adplug.db and may only be <br>
manipulated as the superuser. An arbitrary database file
might be used as well, by specifying the -d commandline
parameter. Only one database file may be manipulated at a
time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
adplugdb returns with a successful exit status (0 on most
systems) on successful operation. An unsuccessful exit
status (1 on most systems) is returned otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMANDS <br>
Commands control the main operation mode of adplugdb.
Commands can have a number of arguments. Only one command
may be specified at a time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">add This command takes a list of
filenames, separated by spaces, as arguments. Each file is
examined and a record is added to the database if the file
is supported by AdPlug. <br>
By default, the record will be of type Plain, unless the -t
commandline option is specified (see below). The default
comment entry is the specified filename. If a record <br>
for a file is already in the database, it will be replaced
by the new record.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list This command takes an
optional list of filenames or keys, separated by spaces, as
arguments. Each file is examined and the corresponding
record is looked up from the data&acirc; <br>
base and displayed on stdout, in a human-readable form. If
no arguments are given, all records from the database are
displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">remove This command takes a list
of filenames or keys, separated by spaces, as arguments.
Each file is examined and the corresponding record is
removed from the database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">merge This command takes a list
of database filenames, separated by spaces, as arguments.
Each database file is loaded and the contents are merged and
written to the central <br>
database file. The database files are processed in the order
they are specified on the commandline. Records from
databases that were specified earlier take precedence over
<br>
records from databases that were specified later. Records
from the central database take precedence over all other
records. This means that only additional records from <br>
the other databases will be added to the central database
and if a record is found that is not already in the central
database, the version from the earliest specified <br>
database that contains this record will be taken. In no way
will records ever be overwritten in the central
database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The order of the option commandline parameters is not
important.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Database options: <br>
-d &lt;file&gt; <br>
Specify an arbitrary file to use as the central
database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Use the system-wide database
file as the central database. This option is only present if
adplugdb was compiled with system-wide database file
support.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t &lt;type&gt; <br>
Specify a record type to be used as the type for all newly
added records. Each record needs a special type to be useful
to AdPlug&rsquo;s players. The commandline help, dis&acirc;
<br>
played using the -h commandline option, presents a list of
types that may be specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Prompt for record comment. If
this option is given, the user will be prompted and asked
for each newly added record&rsquo;s comment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k Specify keys instead of
filenames. If this option is given, all command arguments
that normally are filenames are expected to be record keys
instead. Each record in the <br>
database has a unique identifying key, generated from the
corresponding file&rsquo;s contents. To manipulate a record
entry, you either must have the exact same file and specify
<br>
its name, or you specify the record&rsquo;s key, using this
option. Keys are specified the same way they are displayed
using the list command, as CRC16:CRC32 value in
hexadeci&acirc; <br>
mal format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Generic options: <br>
-q, --quiet <br>
Be more quiet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
Be more verbose.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Show summary of commandline commands, arguments and
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
Show version and author information of the program.</p>
