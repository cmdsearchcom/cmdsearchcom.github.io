<p>scanmem(1) General Commands Manual scanmem(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
scanmem - locate and modify a variable in an executing
process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
scanmem [options] [target-program-pid]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
scanmem is an interactive debugging utility that can be used
to isolate the address of a variable in an executing process
by successively scanning the process&rsquo; address space
<br>
looking for matching values. By informing scanmem how the
value of the variable changes over time, it can determine
the actual location (or locations) of the variable by
succes&acirc; <br>
sively eliminating non-matches. scanmem determines where to
look by searching for mappings with read / write permission,
these are referred to as regions. Users can eliminate <br>
regions they believe are likely unrelated to the target
variable (for example, located in a shared library unrelated
to the variable in question), this will improve the speed of
<br>
the scan, which can initially be quite slow in large
programs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once a variable has been found,
scanmem can monitor the variable, or change it to a user
specified value, either once, or continually over a period
of time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">scanmem works similarly to the
&quot;pokefinders&quot; once commonly used to cheat at video
games, this function is a good demonstration of how to use
scanmem, and is used in the documen&acirc; <br>
tation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USAGE <br>
scanmem should be invoked with the process id of the program
you wish to debug as an argument. Once started, scanmem
accepts interactive commands. These are described below,
how&acirc; <br>
ever entering help at the &gt; prompt will allow you to
access scanmem&rsquo;s online documentation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The target-program-pid can be
specified in decimal, hexadecimal, or octal using the
standard C language notation (leading 0x for hexadecimal,
leading 0 for octal, anything else <br>
is assumed to be decimal).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, --pid=pid</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Set the target-program-pid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --version</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Print version and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Print a short description of
command line options then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --debug</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Run in debug mode, more
information will be outputted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMANDS <br>
While in interactive mode, scanmem prints a decimal number
followed by &gt;, the number is the current number of
possible candidates for the target variable that are known.
0 indi&acirc; <br>
cates that no possible variables have been eliminated yet.
The default scan data type is &quot;int&quot;. It can be
changed with the option command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">n</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Where n represents any number in
decimal, octal or hexadecimal, this command tells scanmem
that the current value of the target variable is exactly n.
scanmem will begin a <br>
search of the entire address space, or the existing known
matches (if any), eliminating any variable that does not
have this value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">n..m</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is like the n command but
scanmem searches for a range of numbers between n and m
inclusive instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt;, &lt;, =, !=, ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following commands are
extremely useful for locating a variable where we cannot see
its exact value but we can see for example how it changes
over time like with a health <br>
bar. These commands usually cannot be used for the first
scan but there are some exceptions: &gt; n, &lt; n, = n and
!= n.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt; [n]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If n is given, match values that
are greater than n. Otherwise match all values that have
increased.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt; [n]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If n is given, match values that
are less than n. Otherwise match all values that have
decreased.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+ [n]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If n is given, match values that
have been increased by n. Otherwise match all values that
have increased (same as &gt;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- [n]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If n is given, match values that
have been decreased by n. Otherwise match all values that
have decreased (same as &lt;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">= [n]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If n is given, match values that
are equal to n (same as n). Otherwise match all values that
have not changed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">!= [n]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If n is given, match values that
are different from n. Otherwise match all values that have
changed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">snapshot</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Match any value. This is useful
when an initial value or range is not known for subsequent
scans with &gt;, &lt;, +, -, =, and !=.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot; text</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Search for the provided text in
memory if the scan data type is set to
&quot;string&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">update</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Scans the current process,
getting the current values of all matches. These values can
be viewed with list, and are also the old values that
scanmem compares to when using &gt;, &lt;, <br>
or =. This command is equivalent to a search command that
all current results match.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">List all the possible candidates
currently known, including their address, region id, match
offset, region type, last known value and possible value
types. The value in the <br>
first column is the match id, and can be used in conjunction
with the delete command to eliminate matches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For experts: The match offset is
determined by subtracting the load address of the associated
ELF file or region from the address. It can be used to
bypass Address Space Layout <br>
Randomization (ASLR).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">delete match-id</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Delete match match-id, which can
be found from the output of the list command. To delete all
matches, see the reset command, or to delete all matches
associated with a particular <br>
library, see the dregion command, which also removes any
associated matches. Please note that match-ids may be
recalculated after matches are removed or added.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">watch match-id</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Monitor the value of match-id,
and print its value as it changes. Every change is printed
along with a timestamp, you can interrupt this command with
^C to stop monitoring.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set
[match-id][,match-id,...]=]value[/delay] [...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Set the value value into the
match numbers match-id, or if just value is specified, all
known matches. value can be specified in standard C language
notation. All known matches, <br>
along with their match-id&rsquo;s can be displayed using the
list command. Multiple match-id&rsquo;s can be specified,
separated with commas and terminated with an = sign. To set
a value <br>
continually, suffix the command with / followed by the
number of seconds to wait between sets. You can interrupt
the set command with ^C to return to the scanmem prompt.
This can <br>
be used to sustain the value of a variable which decreases
overtime, for example a timer that is decremented every
second can be set to 100 every 10 seconds to prevent some
prop&acirc; <br>
erty from ever changing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command is used to change
the value of the variable(s) once found by elimination.
Please note, some applications will store values in multiple
locations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">write value_type address
value</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Manually set the value of the
variable at the specified address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Names of value_type are subject
to change in different versions of scanmem, see more info
using the &lsquo;help write&lsquo; command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dump address length
[filename]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Dump the memory region starting
from address of length length in a human-readable
format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If filename is given, data will
be saved into the file, otherwise data will be displayed on
stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pid [new-pid]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Print out the process id of the
current target program, or change the target to new-pid,
which will reset existing regions and matches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reset</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Forget all known regions and
matches and start again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lregions</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">List all the known regions, this
can be used in combination with the dregion command to
eliminate regions that the user believes are not related to
the variable in question, thus <br>
reducing the address space required to search in. The value
in the first column is the region-id which must be passed to
the dregion command. Besides the start address, the size
<br>
and path (if applicable) are also printed. This can be used
to eliminate regions located in shared libraries that are
unlikely to be relevant to the variable required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For experts: Also the region
type and the load address are displayed. The types are
&quot;exe&quot; (executable) &quot;code&quot; (library),
&quot;heap&quot;, &quot;stack&quot; or &quot;misc&quot;
(everything else). The load <br>
address is the memory location where an ELF file (exe/lib)
has been loaded to. This helps to convert between the
addresses in memory and in the associated ELF file. If the
region <br>
does not belong to an ELF file, then it is the same as the
start address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dregion
[!]region-id[,region-id][,...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Delete the region region-id,
along with any matches from the match list. The region-id
can be found in the output of the lregions command. A
leading ! indicates the list should <br>
be inverted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">option name value</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Change options at runtime. E.g.
the scan data type can be changed. See &lsquo;help
option&lsquo; for all possible names/values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">shell shell-command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Execute shell-command using
/bin/sh, then return.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">show info</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Display information relating to
info - see &lsquo;help show&lsquo; for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">version</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Print the version of scanmem in
use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">help</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Print a short summary of
available commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">exit</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Detach from the target program
and exit immediately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">16 potential matches were found,
many of them are quite unrelated, as they are part of the
stack, belong to libraries or miscellaneous memory-mapped
files. Even the heap is <br>
unlikely for a very old command line game. We could make
scanmem eliminate these manually using the delete command,
however just waiting until the amount of gold changes and
<br>
telling scanmem the new value should be enough. I find some
more gold, and tell scanmem the new value, 83.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">16&gt; 83 <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Only one of the 16 original
candidates now has the value 83, so this must be where the
amount of gold is stored. I&rsquo;ll try setting it to
10,000 pieces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Conclusion: We&rsquo;ve found
and modified the gold value as I32 in static memory of the
executable at virtual memory address 0x7b09e0. This address
belongs to the region with id 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Now it is important to know if
this is a position-independent executable (PIE). We list the
regions for this and check the load address of the
executable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1&gt; lregions <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">We are on x86_64 and 0x400000 is
the static load address for executables there. This means
that this is not a PIE and the gold is always stored at
0x7b09e0. This makes it easy to <br>
use a game trainer like GameConqueror which refills the gold
value periodically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With a PIE we have to use the
match offset (0x3b09e0 here) instead and an advanced game
trainer with PIE support has to determine and add the
current load address to it to get <br>
the current memory address of the gold value of the current
game run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
scanmem has been tested on multiple large programs,
including the 3d shoot-em-up quake3 linux. scanmem is also
tested on ARM platforms and comes with Android support since
ver&acirc; <br>
sion 0.16.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Obviously, scanmem can crash
your program if used incorrectly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some programs store values in
multiple locations, this is why set will change all known
matches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Address Space Layout
Randomization (ASLR) together with position-independent
executables (PIE), position-independent code (PIC) or
dynamic memory on the heap causes variables to <br>
be loaded to different memory addresses at every game start.
Advanced game trainers like ugtrain are required to
periodically refill variables is such memory regions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
scanmem usually requires root privileges for ptrace(2)
because security modules control ptrace() capabilities. On
x86 and x86_64 there is usually the Yama security module
provid&acirc; <br>
ing the file /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope. It is
available since Linux 3.4. If this file contains
&quot;1&quot;, then only parents may ptrace() their children
without root privi&acirc; <br>
leges. This means that scanmem would have to run the game.
This is not possible as this would require major design
changes. So we run scanmem as root.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first scan can be very slow
on large programs, this is not a problem for subsequent
scans as huge portions of the address space are usually
eliminated. This could be improved <br>
in future, perhaps by assuming all integers are aligned by
default. Suggestions welcome.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The snapshot command uses memory
inefficiently, and should probably not be used on large
programs. In future this will use a more intelligent
format.</p>
