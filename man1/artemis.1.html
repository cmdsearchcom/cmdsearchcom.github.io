Artemis - interactive EXAFS data analysis
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>Artemis</b> is a program for analyzing EXAFS data using theoretical standards
  from <b>Feff</b>. <b>Artemis</b> includes interfaces to <b>Atoms</b> and
  <b>Feff</b> as well as forms for defining parameters and applying those
  parameters to the paths from the <b>Feff</b> calculation. <b>Artemis</b> uses
  chi(k) as it's input. It does not handle any data processing chores, such as
  converting raw data to mu(E) or doing background removal. <b>Artemis</b>'s
  sister program <b>Athena</b> is the data processing program.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<b>Artemis</b> is a graphical and interactive program written in the perl
  programming language, using the Tk display engine, the <b>Ifeffit</b> EXAFS
  library, and the PGPLOT plotting library. (See below for a list of relevant
  URLs.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Artemis</b> helps you organize all aspects of a fitting project, including
  running the <b>Feff</b> calculation, settings parameters for the Fourier
  transform and fitting of the data, parameterizing the paths from the
  <b>Feff</b> calculation, running the fit, and plotting the results. The
  <b>Artemis</b> window is divided into three panels. The largest panel is the
  space where most of the work happens. Its content is model and depends on the
  state of the Data and Paths List. This list is in the center, skinny panel.
  The other skinny panel contains the controls the are used to specify how plots
  are made.
<div class="Pp"></div>
At the top of the window are the menubar and the project bar. The project bar
  displays the name of the current project file. It also contains an indicator
  that tells you if the project has been modified since the last time it was
  saved. Clicking on the modified indicator will save the project (just like C-s
  or the &quot;Save project&quot; item in the File menu). At the bottom of the
  screen is the echo area, where <b>Artemis</b> writes all sorts of helpful
  messages as you use the program.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The Data and Paths list contains a tree-like list of all of the objects that can
  be manipulated as you use <b>Artemis</b>. When the program starts, two such
  items are displayed. As you run <b>Feff</b> calculations, import <b>Feff</b>
  paths and other data sets, and run fits, more items are added to this list. In
  total, there are five kinds of entries in this list, each of which controls a
  diffferent aspect of <b>Artemis</b>. These five kinds of list entries are: (1)
  fitting parameters, (2) data, (3) fits, (4) <b>Feff</b> calculation, or (5)
  <b>Feff</b> path. When you click on an item in the Data and Paths List, that
  item will be &quot;selected&quot; and &quot;anchored&quot;. A selected item is
  highlighted in orange. An anchored item is outlined with a dashed line. Only
  one item can be anchored. 0, 1, or more items can be selected.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The anchored item determines the mode of the large panel. For instance, when the
  &quot;Guess, Def, Set&quot; item is anchored, the main panel will display a
  page used for setting the fitting parameters. When a data item is anchored,
  the main panel will display a page for setting Fourier tranform parameters,
  the fitting range, and other parameters associated with the data. Many
  functions in <b>Artemis</b> depend upon the mode of the main panel. Some
  features are available only in certain modes. Each of the modes is described
  in its own document section. See &quot;SECTIONS OF THE DOCUMENT&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Plots in <b>Artemis</b> are always made using the selected items. To plot, for
  example, data, a fit, and several individual paths, it is necessary to select
  each of those items. Many other functions in <b>Artemis</b> also work on the
  set of selected items.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Anchoring and setting paths is usually done by using the mouse in the Data and
  Paths List, although there are several other ways of changing the anchor and
  selection using the mouse or the keyboard. Here is a list of mouse events
  useful in the Data and Paths List:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Left mouse button</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Clicking the left mouse button will clear all selections
      then select and anchor the item clicked. The main panel will display the
      page apporpriate to the anchored item.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Center mouse button</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Clicking the center mouse button will anchor the item
      clicked without changing the selection. The main panel will display the
      page apporpriate to the anchored item.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Right mouse button</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Clicking the right mouse button will anchor the item
      clicked without changing the selection. It will also post a menu of
      functions appopriate to the item clicked. These menus are the same as the
      menus in the menubar at the top of the window. The main panel will display
      the page appopriate to the anchored item.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">C<b>ontrol key + left mouse button</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Clicking the left mouse button while holding down the
      control key will add the item clicked to the group of selected items. The
      anchor is not changed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Shift key + left mouse button</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Clicking the left mouse button while holding down the shift
      key will select all items between the anchor and the item clicked,
      inclusively. The anchor is not changed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Left mouse button + mouse drag</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Clicking the left mouse button then dragging the mouse
      while holding down the button will select all items that you drag the
      cursor over. The item initially clicked will be anchored and the main
      panel will display the page appopriate to the anchored item.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Control-k, Control-j</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Hitting the k or j keys while holdong the control key will
      move the anchor to the previous or next item in the list without changing
      the selection. The main panel will display the page appopriate to the
      anchored item. These two key sequences, behave differently when the Guess,
      Def, Set item is anchored. See The Guess, Def, Set page for details</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Control-l</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Hitting the l key while holding down the control key will
      put focus on the Data and Path List. This allows you to navigate the list
      using the arrow keys.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The color and font of the text in the Data and Paths List indicates the status
  of each item. Any item written in black, upright text is an item that can be
  plotted. When a data set or <b>Feff</b> path is excluded from the fit, it will
  be written in brown text. The Guess, Def, Set item and the <b>Feff</b>
  calculation items are written in italic text. The italic text indicates items
  that cannot be plotted. Although these non-plotable items can be selected,
  they will be ignored when a plot is made.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ARTEMIS:_The_Data_Page"><a class="selflink" href="#ARTEMIS:_The_Data_Page">ARTEMIS:
  The Data Page</a></h1>
<b>ARTEMIS</b> - The data page
<div class="Pp"></div>
The data page is displayed in <b>Artemis</b>'s main panel when a data item is
  anchored in the Data and Paths List. See the main document section for an
  explanation of anchoring and selecting items in the Data and Paths List.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The data page is divided into five sections. At the top is a box containing the
  title lines associated with these data. These are read from the input data
  file, but can be edited at any time by the user. When the data are written to
  output files, the contents of this box are written as headers. Below the
  titles box is the name of the data file that was imported. Below that are four
  boxes containing groups of related controls.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Data_toggles"><a class="selflink" href="#Data_toggles">Data
  toggles</a></h2>
This box contains three toggles that control certain aspects of the fit. The
  first two are only relevant in a multiple data set fit. When setting up a
  project containing a multiple data set fit, it is sometimes useful to exclude
  an entire data set from the fit without deleting it from the project. This can
  be done with the first toggle. When a data set is excluded, it and all items
  beneath it are shown in brown text in the Data and Paths List to indicate that
  they have been excluded from the fit.
<div class="Pp"></div>
After the fit is complete, <b>Artemis</b> wants to show off her handiwork and
  display a plot of the data and the just-finished fit. In the case of a
  multiple data set fit, you might have a preference about which data set gets
  plotting. Click this toggle on for your prefered data set.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The third toggle tells <b>Artemis</b> to do a corefinement of the background
  spline when it performs the fit. This corefinement is, effectively, the same
  operation that was performed by <b>Athena</b> to remove the background from
  the data. The &quot;rmin&quot; parameter serves the same purpose as
  <b>Athena</b>'s &quot;rbkg&quot; parameter. When the fit is performed with the
  background corefinement, a spline is used to fit the Fourier components of the
  data below &quot;rmin&quot; and the <b>Feff</b> paths are used to fit the
  Fourier components between &quot;rmin&quot; and &quot;rmax&quot;. The number
  of parameters used to determine the spline is the number of independent points
  in that portion of the data: &quot;2*delta_k*delta_R/pi&quot;, where
  &quot;delta_k&quot; is the range of the Fourier transform and
  &quot;delta_R&quot; is the range between 0 and &quot;rmin&quot;. The advantage
  of doing the background corefinement, other than the possibility of making the
  fit look nicer at low R, is that correlations between the background
  parameters and the fitting parameters can be measured.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Fourier_transform_and_fitting_parameters"><a class="selflink" href="#Fourier_transform_and_fitting_parameters">Fourier
  transform and fitting parameters</a></h2>
This box contains the controls used to set the ranges of the forward Fourier
  transform and of the fit. The fit range is also used as the backward Fourier
  transform range when a plot is q space is made. See &quot;Pluck buttons&quot;
  for a discussion of the little quare buttons marked with a blue x.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Other controls are used to set the functional forms of the Fourier transform
  window used in k and R. The widths of the sills of those functions are set
  usng the entry boxes labeled &quot;dk&quot; and &quot;dr&quot;.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="k-weight_parameters"><a class="selflink" href="#k-weight_parameters">k-weight
  parameters</a></h2>
The controls in this box are used to set the values of k-weight to be used in
  the fits. There are togles for turning on k-weight of 1, 2, or 3. There is
  also a toggle for specifying an arbitrary value of k-weight.
<div class="Pp"></div>
These are the k-weight values used in the fit but not the k-weight used to plot
  the data. These two purposes of k-weight are handled independently by
  <b>Artemis</b>. See Plotting in Artemis for a discussion of the plotting
  k-weight controls.
<div class="Pp"></div>
People sometimes get confused by the concept of multipl k-weights for fitting.
  The prupose of choosing a low or high value for k-weight is to attempt to
  emphasize either the low- or high-k end of the data. Because different regions
  of the data are sensitive to different kinds of parameters, one might choose a
  low or high value to increase the precision of measurement of certain
  parameters. Doing multiple k-weight fits is a sort of compromise -- a way of
  emphasizing both ends of the data in the fit.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The fit is determined by minimizing a quantity called chi-square. Chi-square is
  evaluated by summing the squares of the difference between the data and the
  theory. Since the FT is complex, there is a real part and an imaginary part.
  So chi-square is proporitional to:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
         /                                                    \
    sum &lt;   Re[ data(R) - th(R) ]^2 + Im[ data(R) - th(R)]^2   &gt;
     R   \                                                    /
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
In a multiple k-weight fit, there are simply more terms in the sum. Let's take a
  kw=1&amp;3 fit as an example. This summation is made for the kw=1 data and
  theory. <b>And</b> the summation is made for the kw=3 data and theory. The
  summations are added together and the full sum is used to evaluate chi-square.
<div class="Pp"></div>
At the end of the day, there is only one set of guess parameters that have been
  optimized by the fit. These guess parameters along with the set parameters are
  used to evaluate the def parameters and the path parameters. The path
  parameters are used to evaluate the exafs equation for each path. The exafs
  equations for the paths are summed up to make the best-fit theoretical chi(k).
  You have a data chi(k) and a best-fit chi(k). Those can then be plotted
  however you like -- even using a k-weight that was not used in determining the
  fit.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Other_parameters"><a class="selflink" href="#Other_parameters">Other
  parameters</a></h2>
The last box contains several controls that did not fit into theother boxes.
  There is a menu for selecting the fitting space. You can choose to fit the
  data in any of k, R, or q space. The default is to fit in R.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Epsilon is the uncertainty used to evaluate chi-square. Normally it is fine to
  let <b>Artemis</b> use the default value (which is determined from the RMS
  value of the data between 15 and 25 angstroms in R-space). In some situations,
  you may find it useful to explicitly set a value for epsilon.
<div class="Pp"></div>
After the fit, <b>Artemis</b> writes a log file documenting the fit. Among the
  information in that log file are the correlations between all the fitting
  parameters. You can set the level below which <b>Artemis</b> will exclude a
  correlation from this report.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Finally, there is a menu for selecting the path to use for phase corrected
  plots. This menu contains the first five paths from each <b>Feff</b>
  calculation used with the data set. When a path is selected for phase
  corrected plots, the full phase shift of that path -- both the central atom
  and scattering atom portions -- will be subtracted from anything that is
  Fourier transformed before it is plotted. If a path is selected for phase
  correction and you make a plot of, say, the data, the fit, and several paths,
  the selected phase shift will be subtracted from each item before it is
  plotted. Phase correction is for plotting only. Fits are always done on
  non-phase-corrected data.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Pluck_buttons"><a class="selflink" href="#Pluck_buttons">Pluck
  buttons</a></h2>
Several of the controls on this page a have a small button with a blue x next to
  them. These are called pluck buttons and are used for grabbing values from the
  plot window. When you click on one of these buttons, a prompt will be written
  to echo area asking you to click on a pointin the plot. When you do so, the
  value that you clicked on will be inserted into the entry box adjacent to the
  pluck button. <b>Artemis</b> is careful not to let you pluck a k-value from a
  plot in R, or vice versa.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Context_menus"><a class="selflink" href="#Context_menus">Context
  menus</a></h2>
As you pass the mouse over labels on the data page, the text under the mouse
  will change color. This color change is an indication that mouse clicks will
  do something. A left mouse click on one of these labels will cause a brief
  description of that parameter to be displayed in the echo area. Many of these
  descriptions also suggest reasonable values for the parameter.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Clicking the right mouse button on one of the labels will post a context menu of
  useful function. One such function is restore that parameter to its default
  value. If you have a muliple data set fit, the other menu options allow you to
  constrain the parameter between data sets.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The labels at the top of the boxes are all sensitive to the left mouse button.
  The labels atop the Fourier transform and fit range box and the k-weights box
  are also sensitive to the right mouse click.

  Guess, Set, Def Parameters</a></h1>
<b>ARTEMIS</b> - Guess, set, def parameters
<div class="Pp"></div>
This page is used to define the parameters of the fitting model. In
  <b>Artemis</b> there are six kinds of parameters:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Guess</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Guess parameters are the ones that are optimize during the
      course of the fit to best-fit the theory to the data.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Def</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Def parameters are typically expressed as math expressions
      which may be functionally dependant upon other parameters. These math
      expressions are updated throughout the course of the fit. As the guess
      parameters are update, so are the def parameters.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Set</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Set parameters are evaluated at the beginning of the fit
      and not updated throughout the fit. This is the main difference between
      def and set parameters. Set parameters can be numbers or math
    expressions.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Restraint</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Restraints are math expressions which, like def parameters,
      are updated throughout the course of the fit, but which take on a special
      role in the fit. A restraint is evaluated and added in quadrature to the
      evaluation of the chi-square parameter. A restraint, therefore, can be
      used to incorporate a a bias in the fitting result towards a piece of
      prior knowledge about the physical system. See the <b>Ifeffit</b> for a
      complete discussion of restraints.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Skip</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Skip parameters are maintained in the project but are not
      used in any capacity in the fit. The point of a skip parameter is to
      maintain but not use a complicated parameter with a complicated math
      expression.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>After</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">An after is similar to a def parameter in that it may be a
      math expression dependent upon other parameters. An after is not, however,
      a part of the fitting model. Instead it is a parameter that will be
      evaluated upon completion of the fit using the best fit values. The list
      of after parameters will be reported in the log file. Using an after
      parameter anywhere in your fitting model will result in Artemis reporting
      an error in the model. Afters can depend upon other afters, but you should
      take care in with the order that the afters appear in the list. The after
      parameters will be evaulated only once after the fit, thus circular or
      out-of-order dependencies will not be resolved.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The Guess, Def, Set page is divided into two sections. At the top is a listbox
  containing the list of all defined parameters. At the bottom is the edit area
  which contains the controls used to establish the parameters.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="The_parameter_listbox"><a class="selflink" href="#The_parameter_listbox">The
  parameter listbox</a></h2>
This area contains a four-column list of all the parameters defined in a
  project. The left-most column counts the parameters. The second column
  contains a tag identifying the type of the parameter. The third column
  contains the parameter name. The right-most column contains the parameter's
  math expression.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Parameters are coded by color and by the tag in the second column. Guess
  parameters are written in purple text and have the &quot;g:&quot; tag. Def
  parameters are written in green text and have the &quot;d:&quot; tag. Set
  parameters are written in black text and have the &quot;s:&quot; tag.
  Restraints are written in pink text and have the &quot;r:&quot; tag. Skip
  parameters are written in grey text and have no tag. After parameters are
  written in blue-grey text and have the &quot;a:&quot; tag.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There are a large number of mouse clicks and key sequences that serve a purpose
  in the listbox:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">1.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">A left mouse click selects a parameter and displays it in
      the edit area.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">2.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">A double click of the left mouse button selects a
      parameter, displays it in the edit area, and prompts you for the parameter
      annotation. See &quot;Parameter annotations&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">3.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">A right mouse click selects a parameter, displays it in the
      edit area, and posts a contextual menu about that parameter. The menu has
      several items in it. The &quot;Move&quot; submenu is sued to reposition
      the current parameter in the list. The &quot;Make&quot; submenu serves to
      change the type of the parameter. The &quot;Copy&quot; item will replicate
      the anchored parameter, appending a few characters to the end of its name.
      The &quot;Build restraint&quot; item is discussed below. The
      &quot;Annotate&quot; menu item prompts for the parameter annotation. The
      &quot;Find&quot; menu item will search through all parameter and path
      parameter math expressions and show you how that parameter is used in the
      project. The &quot;Grab&quot; menu item is only enabled for guess
      parameters and will insert the best-fit value from a fit as the value for
      that parameter. Finally the &quot;Discard&quot; menu item will remove that
      parameter from the list after prompting for confirmation.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">4.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Control-d will define the parameter in the edit area.</dd>

</dl>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Extended_selection"><a class="selflink" href="#Extended_selection">Extended
  selection</a></h2>
Multiple items in the list of parameters can be selected using the
  control-click, shift-click, and click-drag sequences described for the Data
  and Paths List and for the log viewer. Only the anchored list item (i.e. the
  one surreounded by a dashed line and displayed in the edit area) can have its
  name and math expression edited.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The advantage of extended selection is that certain of the context menu options
  discussed above in item #3 can operate on many parameters at once. By doing
  extended selection then clicking the right mouse button somewhere in the
  selected region, the context menu will be posted with options for the group of
  selected parameters. Currently, groups of parameters can have their types set
  and can be discarded in this manner.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you right-click outside the selected region, the extended selection will be
  cleared and the parameter clicked on will be anchored and selected.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="The_edit_area"><a class="selflink" href="#The_edit_area">The
  edit area</a></h2>
There are three rows of controls in the edit area. The top row has two entry
  boxes. The smaller one on the left is for entering the name of the parameter.
  The larger one on the right is for entering the parameter's math expression.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Below the entry boxes are a set of five radiobuttons for selecting the type of
  parameter being edited.
<div class="Pp"></div>
At the bottom of the edit area are five buttons for acting upon the parameter
  being edited. The &quot;Undo edit&quot; button clears the entry boxes and
  discards whatever changes were just made. The &quot;New&quot; button is used
  to define a brand new parameter. It clears the entry boxes, unselects
  parameters in the listbox, and gives focus to entry box for entering the
  parameter name. The &quot;Grab&quot; button becomes enabled after a fit is
  run. It inserts the best-fit value for a guess parameter. The
  &quot;Discard&quot; button deletes a parameter from the list. A dialog pops up
  confirming deletion. Finally, the &quot;Hide&quot; button removes the edit
  area from view to allow more parameters to be visible in the listbox. When the
  edit area is hidden, it is replaced by a button for restoring the edit area.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Here are the details of the behavior of these controls:

<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Parameter_annotations"><a class="selflink" href="#Parameter_annotations">Parameter
  annotations</a></h2>
An annotation is a short text string that is associated with the parameter. This
  string is written to the echo area whenever the parameter is selected in the
  listbox on the Guess, Def, Set page. The purpose of he annotation is to write
  a little hint about the role played by the parameter in the fiting model. If a
  guess parameters has no annotation when a fit is run, its annotation will be
  generated automatically. The automatic annotation for a guess parameter is its
  best fit value +/- its error bar. The automatic annotation for a def, after,
  or restrain parameter is its evaluated value after the fit.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Building_restraints"><a class="selflink" href="#Building_restraints">Building
  restraints</a></h2>
One of the items in the context menu displayed when right-clicking on a
  parameter is for building restraints based on guess or def parameters. This
  tool provides a dialog for constructing one particular type of restraint --
  the type that coerces a parameter to stay within a boundries for its value.
  The dialog prompts for a minimum and maximum value and for a term called the
  &quot;amplifier&quot;. The math expression constructed is this one:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    restrain  param_res = penalty(param, min, max) * amp
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The penalty function evaluates to 0 when &quot;param&quot; is between
  &quot;min&quot; and &quot;max&quot;, to &quot;abs(min-param)&quot; when
  &quot;param&quot; is less than &quot;min&quot;, and to
  &quot;abs(param-max)&quot; when &quot;param&quot; is greater than
  &quot;max&quot;. This is added in quadrature to reduced chi-square as the fit
  is evaluated.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The amplifier term determines the magnitude of the penalty. A large value for
  &quot;amp&quot; will force the fitted value of &quot;param&quot; not to stray
  too far outside its bounds. A small value will allow the fit more freedom to
  let &quot;param&quot; deviate from your initial guess.
<div class="Pp"></div>
See the <b>Ifeffit</b> FAQ, question 8.1 for more discussion of restraints,
  including discussion of other ways to set restraints that do not involve the
  &quot;penalty()&quot; function.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A cautionary note: restraints are not always appropriate. As an example, if a
  fit is returning a negative value for sigma^2, it may not be appropriate to
  apply a stiff restraint as a way of forcing that sigma^2 to be a value that
  you expect. Often, a negative sigma^2 is indicative of some other problem in
  the fitting model such as excessive structural disorder, a coordination number
  that is forced to be too small, the incorrect atomic species for a
  backscatterer, or some such. Using a restraint on sigma^2 in a case like this
  would not fix the problem. Quite the opposite, it might foster a false sense
  of accomplishment by &quot;fixing&quot; the sigma^2 &quot;problem&quot;
  without actually addressing the actual problem in the fitting model.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Highlighting"><a class="selflink" href="#Highlighting">Highlighting</a></h2>
There is an option in the GDS menu for highlighting parameters. This prompts you
  for a text string. Any parameter names or math expressions that match that
  string will be marked with a green background. This is particularly useful for
  large parameter lists. The text string is interpreted as a perl regular
  expression and so any valid perl metacharacters can be used. (This includes
  regular expressions using &quot;(?{ code })&quot; and other similar
  constructions, a practice the author of <b>Artemis</b> does not recommend, but
  does not prevent.)
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Importing_and_exporting_text_files"><a class="selflink" href="#Importing_and_exporting_text_files">Importing
  and exporting text files</a></h2>
For large, complex fitting models, it may be convenient to edit the parameter
  list with a text editor or even to write a program which generates the
  parameters and writes them to a text file. In that case, it is convenient to
  be able to import and export a textual respresentation of the parameter list.
  These files are of a simple format. Any line like these:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   guess  a   5
   set    b   6
   def    c   a+b
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
can imported to and exported from the Guess, Def, Set page via the GDS menu. In
  an imported file, any line beginning with any of &quot;guess&quot;,
  &quot;def&quot;, &quot;set&quot;, &quot;restrain&quot;, &quot;after&quot;, or
  &quot;skip&quot; will be imported as a parameter. The second word on the line
  will be taken as the parameter name and the remaining words on the line will
  be concatinated to form the math expression. On export lines will follow this
  format:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   type name = math_expression
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Very little error checking is performed upon import to verify that the parameter
  is defined sensibly, so use this feature with caution.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ARTEMIS:_ATOMS,_The_Crystallographic_Front_End_to_FEFF"><a class="selflink" href="#ARTEMIS:_ATOMS,_The_Crystallographic_Front_End_to_FEFF">ARTEMIS:
  ATOMS, The Crystallographic Front End to FEFF</a></h1>
<b>ARTEMIS</b> - <b>ATOMS</b>, The Crystallographic Front End to <b>FEFF</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The purpose of <b>Atoms</b> is to generate a &quot;feff.inp&quot; file from
  crystallographic data. The hard part of making a &quot;feff.inp&quot; file is
  creating the long list of atomic coordinates. <b>Atoms</b> thus makes the hard
  part of running <b>Feff</b> easy, at least for crystalline matrials.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This page can be used to create input data for <b>Atoms</b> from scratch. It
  will also be used to display crystallography data imported from an
  &quot;atoms.inp&quot; file or a CIF file. To import an &quot;atoms.inp&quot;
  file or CIF file, use the normal file import dialog.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="The_title_box"><a class="selflink" href="#The_title_box">The
  title box</a></h2>
At the top is a text box for entering title lines identifying the
  crystallographic data. These lines will be written to the &quot;feff.inp&quot;
  file and to the top of the <b>Feff</b> interpretation page. This is a good
  place to cite the literature reference or to provide other important
  information about the crystal.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Crystal_parameters"><a class="selflink" href="#Crystal_parameters">Crystal
  parameters</a></h2>
To the left side of the page are entry boxes for entering space group, lattice
  constants, and lattice angles of the crystal. A space group must always be
  provided. <b>Atoms</b> is very flexible about how the space group symbol is
  entered. You can use the Hermann-Maguin or Scheonflies symbols or the index of
  the space group from the International Tables. The algorithm that interprets
  the symbol is insensitive to white space and capitalization -- &quot;P m -3
  m&quot; and &quot;PM-3M&quot; are interpreted the same. For complete details
  about how the symbols are interpreted, see the <b>Atoms</b> docuemntation on
  Bruce's web site.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Lattice constants are entered in units of Angstroms, angles are entered as
  decimal numbers in degrees (and not in arc minutes -- i.e. 89 and a half
  degrees is entered as 89.5 rather than 89'30&quot;). Many space groups have
  symmetries that make some lattice angles and constants the same. In those
  situations, it is only necesary to fill in the essential values. For instance,
  a cubic space group only requires a value for the &quot;a&quot; constant.
  <b>Atoms</b> will know to set the other lattice constants the same and to set
  the angles to 90 degrees. For lower symmetry groups, you must provide all the
  necessary information.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Below the lattice constants are entry boxes for &quot;Rmax&quot; and the shift
  vector and a menu for selecting the absorption edge of the <b>Feff</b>
  calculation. &quot;Rmax&quot; is the radial extent of the cluster that will be
  written to the &quot;feff.inp&quot; file. Some space groups are given in the
  International Tables with two different origins -- i.e. the origin is placed
  at sites with two different point symmetries. The fractional coordinates of
  the sites are different for the two different settings of the crystal. In
  those cases, <b>Atoms</b> requires that you use a particular one of the two
  choices. If your input data has used the other origin choice, it should be
  fairly obvious. In that case, coordination numbers and distances to the
  coordination shells will usually be obviously wrong. When you use one of the
  space groups for which two origin choices exist, <b>Artemis</b> will issue a
  warning. If you suspect that the wrong origin choice has been used, insert the
  values for the shift vector that were reported in the warning message.
<div class="Pp"></div>
On occassion, crystals are reported in the literature using origins other than
  the standard one used in the International Tables. A famous example is
  germanium oxide. Here is the crystal data for GeO2:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   title GeO2 (hexagonal)
   space p 32 2 1
   a=4.98502       c=5.64800
   rmax=6.0        core=Ge
   shift   0 0 0.66667
   atoms
     Ge    0.4513  0.0     0.0
     O     0.3969  0.3021  0.0909
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
For some reason, the crystallography reference for this material uses an origin
  that is shifted by 2/3 in the z direction relative to the origin used in the
  International Tables. To get <b>Atoms</b> to compute this structure correctly,
  the shift vector given above must be used.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="The_atoms_list"><a class="selflink" href="#The_atoms_list">The
  atoms list</a></h2>
To the right side of the page is the list of unique crystallographic sites. As
  new sites are created, they are inserted into the list. The sites are not
  edited directly, instead the editing area at the bottom of the screen is used
  and the list of all sites is displayed here. This works much the same as the
  Guess, Def, Set page.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To edit a site, left-click on its entry in the list. It's element symbols,
  coordinates, and site tag will be displayed in the edit area. A right click on
  a site in the list will post a context menu with several functions that can be
  perfromed on that site. You can re-order the list using the &quot;Move&quot;
  menu item. A site can be copied and the copy added to the list using the
  &quot;Copy&quot; menu item. The &quot;Discard&quot; menu item completely
  removes the site from the list. The list supports extended selection. When
  many sites are selected (i.e. highlighted in yellow), the &quot;Discard&quot;
  menu item will work on all the selected sites.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Sites can also be reordered using the keyboard. &quot;Alt-k&quot; and
  &quot;Alt-j&quot; can be used to move the selected site up or down in the
  list.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="The_edit_area"><a class="selflink" href="#The_edit_area">The
  edit area</a></h2>
At the bottom of the page is the collection of widgets used to actually create
  and edit unique crystallographic sites. The element box is used to insert the
  two-letter element symbol for the site. The site will not be created if this
  is not a valid symbol. The tag can be any 10-letter string used to identify
  the site. The tag is used to differentiate sites that contain the same
  element.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The boxes for the &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, and &quot;z&quot; coordinates
  can be filled with floating point numbers or simple fractions. That is, 0.5
  and &quot;1/2&quot; are both acceptable. These coordinates are fractional
  positions in the unit cell and are not Cartesian coordinates.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Once you have created all sites in your crystal, click the &quot;Run Atoms&quot;
  button. This will process the crystallographic data, create the
  &quot;feff.inp&quot; file, display the &quot;feff.inp&quot; page.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Atoms_template_files"><a class="selflink" href="#Atoms_template_files">Atoms
  template files</a></h2>
The &quot;feff.inp&quot; data that is generated when the &quot;Run Atoms&quot;
  button is pressed is determined by the contents of a special template file.
  <b>Artemis</b> is distributed with a number of template files serving
  different purposes. The structure of the &quot;feff.inp&quot; data is set by
  the value of the &quot;atoms-&gt;template&quot; preference. The default value
  is &quot;feff&quot;, which tells <b>Artemis</b> to use the template file
  suitable for running <b>Feff6</b>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you want to run some other version of <b>Feff</b>, you should set the
  &quot;atoms-&gt;template&quot; preference variable to the appropriate value.
  Templates are provided with <b>Artemis</b> for writing <b>Feff7</b> and
  <b>Feff8</b> input files. <b>Feff8</b> input files can be written which are
  suitable for XANES or non-self-consistent EXAFS calculations.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Sometimes, it is useful to modify template files for writing out specialized
  &quot;feff.inp&quot; data. If these modified template files are placed in
  &quot;~/.horae/atp/&quot; (unix) or &quot;C:Program
  Files\Ifeffit\horae\atp&quot; (windows), <b>Artemis</b> will be able to find
  them.

<b>ARTEMIS</b> - The <b>FEFF</b> input file
<div class="Pp"></div>
This page displays the <b>Feff</b> input data, which includes some control
  parameters and a long list of atomic coordinates. This page is no more
  sophisticated than a text box which serves as a primitive editor and a button
  at the bottom for running <b>Feff</b>. Explaining <b>Feff</b> is beyond the
  scope of this document.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When <b>feff</b> is finished, you will presented with a dialog asking how many
  paths to import. The choices are none, the first path, the first 10 paths, and
  all paths. The number in the third option is configurable in the preferences
  dialog. Should you ever need to rerun <b>Feff</b> after starting a project,
  &quot;none&quot; is usually the right answer. The other options may result in
  one or more paths being defined twice in the project -- a confusing situation.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If <b>Feff</b> fails to run to completion, <b>Artemis</b> will try to recognize
  the problem and post a suggestion for how to solve the problem. If

<b>ARTEMIS</b> - Interpretation of the <b>FEFF</b> calculation
<div class="Pp"></div>
This page provides a concise overview of the <b>Feff</b> calculation. At the top
  of the page is a summary of some of the statistics of the calculation. Below
  that is a chart showing the details of each path from the calculation. For
  each path, the degeneracy, the half path length and the amplitude factor are
  shown. The last column shows a tokenized summary of the scattering path --
  this allows you to see at a glance which atoms were involved in the path.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The information and context menus available on this page allow you organize,
  understand, and manipulate the paths in this <b>Feff</b> calculation. Pretty
  much all functions involving the paths <i>except</i> writing math expressions
  for the path parameters are available on this page.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="The_interpretation_chart"><a class="selflink" href="#The_interpretation_chart">The

The colors and fonts used in the chart convey information:

<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Context_menus"><a class="selflink" href="#Context_menus">Context
  menus</a></h2>
There are interesting and useful context menus on every part of this page. These
  menus are available by right clicking.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Right clicking anywhere in the text box at the top of the page will pop up a
  menu with options for viewing files from the <b>Feff</b> calculation.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Right clicking in the interpretation chart will post a menu of options relevant
  to the path on the line on which you clicked. Each of the four kinds of paths
  given by the four fonts described above has its own menu.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For paths that are imported in the fit, the menu offers options for plotting the
  path, displaying that path's page, including or excluding the path in the fit,
  selecting or deselecting that path for plotting, making that path the default
  for evaluation of def parameters after a fit, displaying the text of the file
  containing the path, or discarding the path. The choices for including or
  excluding and for selecting or deselecting depend on the state of that path in
  the Data and Paths List. Also some options might be greyed out depending on
  the state of that path.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For paths that have not been imported into the project, the context menu allows
  you to import the path with the option of displaying its page or leaving the
  display on the <b>Feff</b> interpretation. For paths that are unavailable for
  import, a message saying so is posted when one of those lines is
  right-clicked.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The interpretation chart allows for extended selection of lines in the chart.
  You can select additional paths by holding the control key while clicking with
  the left mouse button. Holding the shift key while left clicking selects all
  line between the anchor (the one outlined with a dashed line) and the one you
  click on. You can also click and drag to select all the lines you drag over.
  When more than one line is selected, the content of the context menu change to
  reflect functionality that makes sense for many paths. Extended selection in
  the interpretation chart is therefore a good way of including/excluding,
  selecting/deselecting, or plotting a large number of paths.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The context menu that pops up when many lines are selected may be a little
  surprising. Its contents depend upon the state of the anchored line, which in
  this case is the one that you right-click on to post the menu. The options in
  the context menu will be suitable to the state of the anchored selection
  regardless of the states of the other selected lines. If you choose a menu
  item that does not make sense for some of the selected lines, those lines will
  be ignored.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Here is a concrete example. Suppose that you select a number of lines, some of
  which are included in the fit and some of which have not been imported in the
  fit. If you then right click on one of the included paths, you will get
  options appropriate to included paths. If you then ask to plot the selected
  paths along with the data, the included paths will be plotted and the imported
  paths will be ignored. If, instead, you click on one of the paths that has not
  been imported yet, the context menu will give you the option of importing the
  selected paths. In that case, the paths that have already been imported will
  be ignored.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Trouble_shooting"><a class="selflink" href="#Trouble_shooting">Trouble
  shooting</a></h2>
On occassion you might see that lines in the <b>Feff</b> interpretation do not
  properly report on the contents of the path. When this happens, site tags are
  replaced by this string: &quot;&lt;?&gt;&quot;. There are a couple common
  reasons you might see the &quot;&lt;?&gt;&quot; tags:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">1.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">You have done some advanced voodoo with <b>Feff</b>,
      editing the &quot;files.dat&quot; or &quot;paths.dat&quot; files then
      rerunning the last module to produce specialized output.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">2.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">You have discovered a bug in the algorithm <b>Artemis</b>
      uses to harvest information from the <b>Feff</b> calculation. IN that
      case, you should send the &quot;feff.inp&quot; file or the <b>Artemis</b>
      project file to Bruce so he can fix the problem.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that the appearance of the &quot;&lt;?&gt;&quot; tags is probably not an
  indication that <b>Feff</b> has misbehaved. The <b>Feff</b> calculation has to
  run to completion and generate its normal output before this problem can
  manifest itself. The <b>Feff</b> calculation is almost certainly usable to
  analyze the data. The <b>Feff</b> interpretation page is <b>Artemis</b>'s
  attempt to organize information about the <b>Feff</b> calculation in some
  user-friendly format. That this organizational effort failed is not
  necessarily an indication that <b>Feff</b> failed.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ARTEMIS:_The_Path_Page"><a class="selflink" href="#ARTEMIS:_The_Path_Page">ARTEMIS:
  The Path Page</a></h1>
<b>ARTEMIS</b> - The path page
<div class="Pp"></div>
The path page is displayed whenever a <b>Feff</b> path is selected from the Data
  and Paths List. This page is used to establish the math expressions of the
  path parameters for this path.
<div class="Pp"></div>
At the top of the page is a line identifying which <b>Feff</b> calculation this
  path is from. Below that are three toggles. One is used to include of inlcude
  or exclude the path from use in the fit. There are many other ways in
  <b>Artemis</b> to include and exclude paths other than to use this toggle. See
  The Feff interpretation page and &quot;artemis_menubar&quot; for more
  discussion of this. Also Control-t is the same as clicking this toggle.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The second toggle is used to specify paths that you would like plotted after a
  fit (or sum of paths) is finished. By default, the data and the fit (or sum)
  is plotted after the fit (or sum) and no paths are plotted. Any paths selected
  for plotting will be added to the plot after the fit (or sum) is finished.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The third toggle is used to set which path is the default path for evaluation of
  Def parameters after the fit. It is possible to write math expressions which
  evaluate differently for different paths. An example might be a math
  expression using the &quot;reff&quot; parameter. For any such Def parameters,
  it is necessary to tell <b>Artemis</b> which path should be used for the
  reporting of those parameters in the log file. The default is to use the first
  path listed in the Data and Paths List.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Below that is a box which summarizes the path. This gives some statistics about
  the path as well as displaying a color-coded &quot;map&quot; of the scattering
  path. The central atom is always displayed in red text. Other atoms are in
  black text. The grey text shows the length and scattering angle of each leg of
  the path. In the case of a high-order multiple scattering path which has legs
  which have a non-zero Eulerian eta angle between them, the eta angle will be
  displayed as well. If that last sentence was gibberish, it suffices to know
  that paths of that sort are almost never observable in real EXAFS data.
<div class="Pp"></div>
At the bottom of the page is the list of path parameters. This is the most
  important section of the page because it is here that the details of the
  fitting model are realized. There is an entry box for each of the various
  types of path parameters. The math expression approporiate for each parameter
  should be entered in the entry box.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When a <b>Feff</b> calculation is imported into <b>Artemis</b>, a set of
  automatic parameters are generated, entered into the list on the Guess, Def,
  Set page, and entered into the path parameetr boxes for each path imported.
  The default behavior of <b>Artemis</b> is to generate a set of parameters
  appropriate for a simple, single scattering, first shell fit. While it might
  be OK to immediately click the big green button, most fitting models will
  require substantial editing.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The right mouse button serves many important purposes on the path page. Clicking
  the right mouse button anywhere in one of the entry boxes will highlight the
  word underneath the cursor and post a menu. The entries in the menu are for
  for defining the word as a parameter on the Guess, Def, Set page. For each
  parameter type there is the option of jumping or staying. In either case, the
  parameter is defined and added to the list on the GDS page. For jumping, the
  GDS page is then displayed. For staying, the current path page remains
  displayed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Right clicking on one of the path parameter labels will post a menu of functions
  related to defining path parameter math expressions. The &quot;Edit&quot;
  option will pop up a dialog used for entering a math expression and then
  optionally exporting its value to other paths. The &quot;Clear&quot; option
  doies just that.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The various &quot;Export&quot; options are ways of constraining path parameters
  to be the same for other paths. The &quot;Grab&quot; options make the current
  path parameter the same as the path parameter in the previous or following
  path.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The &quot;sigma^2&quot; label has some additional options. These insert the
  syntactically correct text appropriate to using either the Correlated Debye or
  single frequency Einstein models for the sigma^2 of the path.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To enable the display of spaces for the &quot;dphase&quot;, &quot;k_array&quot;,
  &quot;amp_array&quot;, or &quot;phase_array&quot; path parameters, you must
  click on the &quot;Extended path parameters&quot; button in the Paths menu.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ARTEMIS:_The_Log_Viewer"><a class="selflink" href="#ARTEMIS:_The_Log_Viewer">ARTEMIS:
  The Log Viewer</a></h1>
<b>ARTEMIS</b> - The log viewer
<div class="Pp"></div>
When a fit is anchored in the Data and Paths list, the log file viewer is
  displayed in the main panel. The purpose of this page is to examine log files
  from the most recent fit or from previous fits. These log files can be read
  individually or reports can be generated based on their contents.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When this page is displayed, each fit is entered into the list box on the left
  side of the page. Double clicking the left mouse button on a fit in the
  listbox will display that fit's raw log file. Right clicking on a fit will
  post a menu with choices for displaying that fit's log file in raw, quick, or
  columnar form or for performing some other tasks related to that fit.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Much more interesting than displaying the log files, though, is to generate
  reports on the log files. Near the top of the page is a combo box for
  selecting among the parameters on the Guess, Def, Set page. Choosing one, then
  clicking on the &quot;Write report&quot; button will find extract that
  parameters best-fit value and uncertainty from each log file. This feature
  allows you to track the evolution of individual fitting parameters as you
  develop your fitting model.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The combo box containing the names of the fitting parameters is filled using the
  contents of the Guess, Def, Set page. Sometimes it may be useful instead to
  fill the combo box with the parameter names extracted from a log file. This
  would be useful, for instance, for examining a parameter that is was used at
  one point, but is no longer on the GDS page or has been made into a skip
  parameter (and so is not included in the combo box by default). To do this,
  right click on a fit and select the &quot;Get parameter list&quot; item.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Some modifications can be made to the reports generated by the log viewer.
  Clicking on the &quot;Compute the average value&quot; button tells
  <b>Artemis</b> to compute the arithmetic mean and standard deviation of the
  parameter from the values extracted from the various log files. These will be
  displayed in the header of the report.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Clicking on the &quot;Fit Einstein temperature&quot; button will tell
  <b>Artemis</b> to fit sigma^2 data to a model consisting of a single frequency
  oscillator plus a constant offset. The report header will then contain the
  best fit values and uncertainties for the characteristic temperature and
  constant offset. This calculation will only happen is the figures of merit for
  the selected log files are temperatures and the best fit values for the chosen
  parameter are reasonable sigma^2 values. This function makes a series of
  checks on the figures of merit and best fit values to determine if they seem
  to be data appropriate for this calculation. These heuristics can be tuned by
  setting parameters in the logview section of the preferences dialog.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The final item in the context menu that is displayed when right clicking on an
  item in the log files list is an option to restore that fitting model. Among
  the information that is saved every time a fit is made is a complete
  description of the fitting model, including which data file is being fit, the
  complete list of <b>Feff</b> path used, and all fitting, data, and path
  parameters. This feature allow you to revert <b>Artemis</b> to the state it
  was in when a past fit was made. When you do this reversion, <b>Artemis</b>
  will clear out the contents of the Data and Paths List and then recreate the
  project in the form of the selected fitting model. This is more that just a
  change of parameter values. <b>Artemis</b> keeps track of all data and
  <b>Feff</b> paths used throughout the course of the project and can restore
  even fits that are significantly different from the current fit.

  Plotting Data</a></h1>
<b>ARTEMIS</b> - Plotting data
<div class="Pp"></div>
Plots in <b>Artemis</b> are made using the selected items in the Data and Paths
  List, which are the ones highlighted in orange. See the main document section
  for an explanation of how to selected items for plotting.
<div class="Pp"></div>
At the top of the plot panel are three big, red buttons. One is for making a
  plot in k-space, one is for R-space, and the third is for q-space (i.e.
  back-transformed k-space).
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="k-Weighting"><a class="selflink" href="#k-Weighting">k-Weighting</a></h2>
Below the plot buttons are a set of radiobuttons for setting the k-weight to use
  in the plots. The k-weight chosen will be used to weight a plot in k-space or
  to weight data for Fourier transforming. The same k-weight is used for each
  selected item. The button marked &quot;kw&quot; needs some explanation. When
  this button is chosen, the k-weight to use in the plot will be determined from
  the data being plotted. If the arbitrary k-weight enabled for the data set,the
  value for the arbitrary k-weight will be used, other wise the smallest
  k-weight value enabled will be used. There are two reason to use the
  &quot;kw&quot; button. One is to plot using your arbitrary weight. The other
  is to make a plot of two or more data sets using a different k-weight for each
  data set.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that these k-weight controls are unrelated to the controls which set the
  k-weight used in the fit. K-weighting for fitting and plotting are controlled
  independently.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Selecting_What_Gets_Plotted"><a class="selflink" href="#Selecting_What_Gets_Plotted">Selecting
  What Gets Plotted</a></h2>
Below the k-weight radiobuttons are menus for choosing which part of the complex
  functions chi(R) or chi(q) to plot. Plots involving multiple parts of the
  complex functions (e.g. real+envelope) are not currently possible.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Below these menus are three checkbuttons used for plotting the Fourier transform
  window, the background function, and the residual. If the window button is
  pressed, the appropriate window function will be plotted in any plot. The
  background and residual functions are only plotted if one of the selected
  items is a fit. The background will only be plotted if a background
  corefinement was made for that fit. If a fit is not among the selected items,
  the background and residual will not be plotted. Note that a plot with more
  than one selected fit may be quite confusing if the background or residual
  buttons are depressed since the background and residual will be plotted for
  each fit.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The ranges over which the plot will be made in the three spaces are controlled
  by the three sets of entry boxes.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Extra_Plotting_Features"><a class="selflink" href="#Extra_Plotting_Features">Extra
  Plotting Features</a></h2>
The two additional tabs in the plotting panel contain the controls for the
  following utilities:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Indicators</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Indicators are vertical bars that can be placed at user-chosen locations in k-,
  R-, or q-space. These indicators will get displayed every time a plot is made.
  The idea is that indicators are a guide to the eye, drawing attention to a
  place of interest as the data being plotted changes.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Indicators selected in either k- or q-space will be plotted in both k- and
  q-space, but not in R-space. Likewise, indicators selected in R-space will not
  be plotted in k- or q-space.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Several characteristics of the indicators, including the number, the linetype,
  and the color, can be set in the Plot section of the preferences dialog.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The indicators play well with each of the plotting options described below.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Stacking</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Stacking refers to a vertical displacement the various traces. This is most
  useful for plotting the various path contributions in k-space, but is
  sometimes useful in other kinds of plots as well. Stacking requires three
  parameters which are set in the stacking notecard. The first control is series
  of radio buttons for choosing whether stacking happens in k-space, always, or
  never. If the k-space option is chosen, then q-space plots of the real or
  imaginary parts will also be stacked. (Basically, the &quot;k-space&quot;
  choice refers to any wiggly function of wavenumber.) The other two controls
  set the initial offset value and the increment between staces.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Inverting</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Inverting is a useful tool for displaying the path contributions in
  &quot;|chi(R)|&quot; plots. When this is selected, the &quot;|chi(R)|&quot;
  from any paths included in the plot will be multiplied by -1 so that they
  stick down below the zero-axis. Hopefully this kind of plot help reduce
  clutter while still helping to show which paths contribut where. The
  radiobuttons on this notecard allow you choose between never inverting,
  inverting &quot;|chi(R)|&quot;, or inverting both &quot;|chi(R)|&quot; and
  &quot;|chi(q)|&quot;. The real and imaginary parts in R- or q-space are never
  inverted. chi(k) is also never inverted. Inverting is turned off whenever
  stacking is selected and would effect the current plot (i.e. you cannot stack
  and invert at the same time).
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Data set offsets</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This feat ure is useful for multiple data set plots. This is similar to stacking
  in that the parameter denotes a vertical offset for use i the plot. Each trace
  associated with a particular data set is plotted at the same lavel, but the
  data sets will be offset by the amount specified by this control. This
  provides a way of simultaneously visualizing all parts of a multiple data set
  fit. Negative values are recommended, with a negative offset, the traces will
  be plotted in the same order from top to bottom as in the plot legend.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Stacking is disabled when data set offsets are used. Inverting is used with data
  set offsets, although I think this results in confusing plots.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Palettes || Using the Data and Paths List || =head1 ARTEMIS: Editing Math
  Expressions
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>ARTEMIS</b> - Editing math expressions
<div class="Pp"></div>
The math expression editing dialog is a way of setting path parameter math
  expressions for many paths at once. It works on a given path parameter, e.g.
  it sets e0 or sigma^2 for many paths but does not touch other path parameters.
  This dialog is available in two different context menus. If you right click on
  a path parameter label on the path page and selection &quot;Edit for many
  paths&quot;, then the dialog will pop up for editing that parameter. If you
  right click on an entry on the <b>Feff</b> interpretation page and select the
  &quot;Edit path parameters&quot; cascade, then select a path parameter, the
  dialog will pop up for editing that parameter.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Operation_of_the_dialog"><a class="selflink" href="#Operation_of_the_dialog">Operation
  of the dialog</a></h2>
The dialog is fairly simple. At the top is a text entry box for typing in your
  math expression. Below that are various radiobuttons for specifying how to
  apply the math expression to the various paths in your project. The options
  are:
<dl class="Bl-tag">

You can write your math expressions using token. Tokens are short character
  strings which will be replaced by path-specific information as the math
  expression is applied to each path. The tokens are:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">%i</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The path index from the <b>Feff</b> calculation. This is

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ARTEMIS:_Automated_First_Shell_Theory"><a class="selflink" href="#ARTEMIS:_Automated_First_Shell_Theory">ARTEMIS:
  Automated First Shell Theory</a></h1>
<b>ARTEMIS</b> - Automated first shell theory
<div class="Pp"></div>
Sometimes thinking about a fitting model is more than a problem merits. You just
  want a quick 'n' dirty stab at the first shell -- perhaps to measure the
  centroid of the distribution, perhaps to tell if a sample is 4- or
  6-coordinated. Whatever.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Artemis</b> is not extremely well suited to rapid-fire, first shell analysis.
  By design, <b>Artemis</b> tends to force the user to slow down and think hard
  about every step. <b>Artemis</b> is powerful, but she ain't simple.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The quick first shell (QFS) theory tool is an attempt at addressing this
  shortcoming. It works like this:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">1.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Import some data. Set the Fourier transform and fitting
      parameters to suitable values. Specifically, be sure to set the fitting
      range such that it encloses the first peak of the data.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">2.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Select &quot;Quick first shell theory&quot; from the Theory
      menu. This will display the QFS dialog.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">3.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The QFS dialog provides spaces for selecting the parameters
      for a simple first shell theory. These include the atomic species of the
      absorber and the scatterer, the absorption edge of the experiment, the
      approximate distance between the absorber and scatterer, and the
      coordination geometry to use in the <b>Feff</b> calculation.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Currently the following coordination geomatries are available:</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">4-coordinate crystal</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">

  <dd class="It-tag">octahedral molecule</dd>

</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>

</dl>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The QFS theory is probably not highly sensitive to the choice of coordination
  geometry. Since the unknown sample is probably not well described by any of
  these geometries, they are all merely approximations for use in a quick 'n'
  dirty fit.</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">4.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Once you have set up the parameters for the QFS theory,
      click the &quot;Do it!&quot; button. This will step through the following
      without pausing:</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">a.</dt>

  <dt class="It-tag">c.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Import the first path from the <b>Feff</b> calculation</dd>
</dl>

  <dt class="It-tag">d.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Create a set of guess parameters for the amplitude, the
      sigma^2, the e0, and the delta R. Also created are set parameters for the
      third and fourth cumulants, but they are set to zero. These higher

      cumulants in subsequent fits merely by changing them from set to
    guess.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;"></div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you have a mixed first shell, you might choose to repeat steps 2 through 4
  two or more times.
<div class="Pp"></div>
At the end of this sequence, you are left with <b>Artemis</b> in its normal
  state. You may need to adjust the parameters used in the fit. The QFS dialog
  is really just a tool for initially setting up the project. It in no way
  changes the normal operation of <b>Artemis</b>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you import data from an <b>Athena</b> project file, the species of the
  absorber and the edge will be set correctly when you start the dialog.
