<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
Artemis - interactive EXAFS data analysis</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Artemis is a program for analyzing EXAFS data using
theoretical standards from Feff. Artemis includes interfaces
to Atoms and Feff as well as forms for defining parameters
and <br>
applying those parameters to the paths from the Feff
calculation. Artemis uses chi(k) as it&rsquo;s input. It
does not handle any data processing chores, such as
converting raw data <br>
to mu(E) or doing background removal. Artemis&rsquo;s sister
program Athena is the data processing program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
Artemis is a graphical and interactive program written in
the perl programming language, using the Tk display engine,
the Ifeffit EXAFS library, and the PGPLOT plotting library.
<br>
(See below for a list of relevant URLs.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Artemis helps you organize all
aspects of a fitting project, including running the Feff
calculation, settings parameters for the Fourier transform
and fitting of the data, <br>
parameterizing the paths from the Feff calculation, running
the fit, and plotting the results. The Artemis window is
divided into three panels. The largest panel is the space
<br>
where most of the work happens. Its content is model and
depends on the state of the Data and Paths List. This list
is in the center, skinny panel. The other skinny panel <br>
contains the controls the are used to specify how plots are
made.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At the top of the window are the
menubar and the project bar. The project bar displays the
name of the current project file. It also contains an
indicator that tells you if the <br>
project has been modified since the last time it was saved.
Clicking on the modified indicator will save the project
(just like C-s or the &quot;Save project&quot; item in the
File menu). <br>
At the bottom of the screen is the echo area, where Artemis
writes all sorts of helpful messages as you use the
program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Data and Paths list contains
a tree-like list of all of the objects that can be
manipulated as you use Artemis. When the program starts, two
such items are displayed. As <br>
you run Feff calculations, import Feff paths and other data
sets, and run fits, more items are added to this list. In
total, there are five kinds of entries in this list, each
<br>
of which controls a diffferent aspect of Artemis. These five
kinds of list entries are: (1) fitting parameters, (2) data,
(3) fits, (4) Feff calculation, or (5) Feff path. When <br>
you click on an item in the Data and Paths List, that item
will be &quot;selected&quot; and &quot;anchored&quot;. A
selected item is highlighted in orange. An anchored item is
outlined with a <br>
dashed line. Only one item can be anchored. 0, 1, or more
items can be selected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The anchored item determines the
mode of the large panel. For instance, when the &quot;Guess,
Def, Set&quot; item is anchored, the main panel will display
a page used for setting the <br>
fitting parameters. When a data item is anchored, the main
panel will display a page for setting Fourier tranform
parameters, the fitting range, and other parameters
associated <br>
with the data. Many functions in Artemis depend upon the
mode of the main panel. Some features are available only in
certain modes. Each of the modes is described in its own
<br>
document section. See &quot;SECTIONS OF THE
DOCUMENT&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Plots in Artemis are always made
using the selected items. To plot, for example, data, a fit,
and several individual paths, it is necessary to select each
of those items. Many <br>
other functions in Artemis also work on the set of selected
items.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Anchoring and setting paths is
usually done by using the mouse in the Data and Paths List,
although there are several other ways of changing the anchor
and selection using the <br>
mouse or the keyboard. Here is a list of mouse events useful
in the Data and Paths List:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Left mouse button <br>
Clicking the left mouse button will clear all selections
then select and anchor the item clicked. The main panel will
display the page apporpriate to the anchored item.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Center mouse button <br>
Clicking the center mouse button will anchor the item
clicked without changing the selection. The main panel will
display the page apporpriate to the anchored item.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Right mouse button <br>
Clicking the right mouse button will anchor the item clicked
without changing the selection. It will also post a menu of
functions appopriate to the item clicked. These <br>
menus are the same as the menus in the menubar at the top of
the window. The main panel will display the page appopriate
to the anchored item.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Control key + left mouse button
<br>
Clicking the left mouse button while holding down the
control key will add the item clicked to the group of
selected items. The anchor is not changed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Shift key + left mouse button
<br>
Clicking the left mouse button while holding down the shift
key will select all items between the anchor and the item
clicked, inclusively. The anchor is not changed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Left mouse button + mouse drag
<br>
Clicking the left mouse button then dragging the mouse while
holding down the button will select all items that you drag
the cursor over. The item initially clicked will be <br>
anchored and the main panel will display the page appopriate
to the anchored item.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Control-k, Control-j <br>
Hitting the k or j keys while holdong the control key will
move the anchor to the previous or next item in the list
without changing the selection. The main panel will <br>
display the page appopriate to the anchored item. These two
key sequences, behave differently when the Guess, Def, Set
item is anchored. See The Guess, Def, Set page for <br>
details</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Control-l <br>
Hitting the l key while holding down the control key will
put focus on the Data and Path List. This allows you to
navigate the list using the arrow keys.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The color and font of the text
in the Data and Paths List indicates the status of each
item. Any item written in black, upright text is an item
that can be plotted. When a data <br>
set or Feff path is excluded from the fit, it will be
written in brown text. The Guess, Def, Set item and the Feff
calculation items are written in italic text. The italic
text <br>
indicates items that cannot be plotted. Although these
non-plotable items can be selected, they will be ignored
when a plot is made.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ARTEMIS: The Data Page <br>
ARTEMIS - The data page</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The data page is displayed in
Artemis&rsquo;s main panel when a data item is anchored in
the Data and Paths List. See the main document section for
an explanation of anchoring and <br>
selecting items in the Data and Paths List.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The data page is divided into
five sections. At the top is a box containing the title
lines associated with these data. These are read from the
input data file, but can be <br>
edited at any time by the user. When the data are written to
output files, the contents of this box are written as
headers. Below the titles box is the name of the data file
<br>
that was imported. Below that are four boxes containing
groups of related controls.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Data toggles <br>
This box contains three toggles that control certain aspects
of the fit. The first two are only relevant in a multiple
data set fit. When setting up a project containing a <br>
multiple data set fit, it is sometimes useful to exclude an
entire data set from the fit without deleting it from the
project. This can be done with the first toggle. When a <br>
data set is excluded, it and all items beneath it are shown
in brown text in the Data and Paths List to indicate that
they have been excluded from the fit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After the fit is complete,
Artemis wants to show off her handiwork and display a plot
of the data and the just-finished fit. In the case of a
multiple data set fit, you might <br>
have a preference about which data set gets plotting. Click
this toggle on for your prefered data set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The third toggle tells Artemis
to do a corefinement of the background spline when it
performs the fit. This corefinement is, effectively, the
same operation that was performed <br>
by Athena to remove the background from the data. The
&quot;rmin&quot; parameter serves the same purpose as
Athena&rsquo;s &quot;rbkg&quot; parameter. When the fit is
performed with the background <br>
corefinement, a spline is used to fit the Fourier components
of the data below &quot;rmin&quot; and the Feff paths are
used to fit the Fourier components between &quot;rmin&quot;
and &quot;rmax&quot;. The <br>
number of parameters used to determine the spline is the
number of independent points in that portion of the data:
&quot;2*delta_k*delta_R/pi&quot;, where &quot;delta_k&quot;
is the range of the <br>
Fourier transform and &quot;delta_R&quot; is the range
between 0 and &quot;rmin&quot;. The advantage of doing the
background corefinement, other than the possibility of
making the fit look nicer at <br>
low R, is that correlations between the background
parameters and the fitting parameters can be measured.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fourier transform and fitting
parameters <br>
This box contains the controls used to set the ranges of the
forward Fourier transform and of the fit. The fit range is
also used as the backward Fourier transform range when a
<br>
plot is q space is made. See &quot;Pluck buttons&quot; for a
discussion of the little quare buttons marked with a blue
x.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other controls are used to set
the functional forms of the Fourier transform window used in
k and R. The widths of the sills of those functions are set
usng the entry boxes <br>
labeled &quot;dk&quot; and &quot;dr&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">k-weight parameters <br>
The controls in this box are used to set the values of
k-weight to be used in the fits. There are togles for
turning on k-weight of 1, 2, or 3. There is also a toggle
for <br>
specifying an arbitrary value of k-weight.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These are the k-weight values
used in the fit but not the k-weight used to plot the data.
These two purposes of k-weight are handled independently by
Artemis. See Plotting in <br>
Artemis for a discussion of the plotting k-weight
controls.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">People sometimes get confused by
the concept of multipl k-weights for fitting. The prupose of
choosing a low or high value for k-weight is to attempt to
emphasize either the <br>
low- or high-k end of the data. Because different regions of
the data are sensitive to different kinds of parameters, one
might choose a low or high value to increase the <br>
precision of measurement of certain parameters. Doing
multiple k-weight fits is a sort of compromise -- a way of
emphasizing both ends of the data in the fit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The fit is determined by
minimizing a quantity called chi-square. Chi-square is
evaluated by summing the squares of the difference between
the data and the theory. Since the FT <br>
is complex, there is a real part and an imaginary part. So
chi-square is proporitional to:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/ sum &lt; Re[ data(R) - th(R)
]^2 + Im[ data(R) - th(R)]^2 &gt; <br>
R &nbsp; /</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In a multiple k-weight fit,
there are simply more terms in the sum. Let&rsquo;s take a
kw=1&amp;3 fit as an example. This summation is made for the
kw=1 data and theory. And the <br>
summation is made for the kw=3 data and theory. The
summations are added together and the full sum is used to
evaluate chi-square.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At the end of the day, there is
only one set of guess parameters that have been optimized by
the fit. These guess parameters along with the set
parameters are used to evaluate <br>
the def parameters and the path parameters. The path
parameters are used to evaluate the exafs equation for each
path. The exafs equations for the paths are summed up to
make <br>
the best-fit theoretical chi(k). You have a data chi(k) and
a best-fit chi(k). Those can then be plotted however you
like -- even using a k-weight that was not used in <br>
determining the fit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other parameters <br>
The last box contains several controls that did not fit into
theother boxes. There is a menu for selecting the fitting
space. You can choose to fit the data in any of k, R, or
<br>
q space. The default is to fit in R.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Epsilon is the uncertainty used
to evaluate chi-square. Normally it is fine to let Artemis
use the default value (which is determined from the RMS
value of the data between 15 <br>
and 25 angstroms in R-space). In some situations, you may
find it useful to explicitly set a value for epsilon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After the fit, Artemis writes a
log file documenting the fit. Among the information in that
log file are the correlations between all the fitting
parameters. You can set the <br>
level below which Artemis will exclude a correlation from
this report.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, there is a menu for
selecting the path to use for phase corrected plots. This
menu contains the first five paths from each Feff
calculation used with the data set. <br>
When a path is selected for phase corrected plots, the full
phase shift of that path -- both the central atom and
scattering atom portions -- will be subtracted from anything
<br>
that is Fourier transformed before it is plotted. If a path
is selected for phase correction and you make a plot of,
say, the data, the fit, and several paths, the selected <br>
phase shift will be subtracted from each item before it is
plotted. Phase correction is for plotting only. Fits are
always done on non-phase-corrected data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pluck buttons <br>
Several of the controls on this page a have a small button
with a blue x next to them. These are called pluck buttons
and are used for grabbing values from the plot window. <br>
When you click on one of these buttons, a prompt will be
written to echo area asking you to click on a pointin the
plot. When you do so, the value that you clicked on will be
<br>
inserted into the entry box adjacent to the pluck button.
Artemis is careful not to let you pluck a k-value from a
plot in R, or vice versa.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Context menus <br>
As you pass the mouse over labels on the data page, the text
under the mouse will change color. This color change is an
indication that mouse clicks will do something. A left <br>
mouse click on one of these labels will cause a brief
description of that parameter to be displayed in the echo
area. Many of these descriptions also suggest reasonable
values <br>
for the parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Clicking the right mouse button
on one of the labels will post a context menu of useful
function. One such function is restore that parameter to its
default value. If you have <br>
a muliple data set fit, the other menu options allow you to
constrain the parameter between data sets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The labels at the top of the
boxes are all sensitive to the left mouse button. The labels
atop the Fourier transform and fit range box and the
k-weights box are also sensitive <br>
to the right mouse click.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ARTEMIS: Guess, Set, Def
Parameters <br>
ARTEMIS - Guess, set, def parameters</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This page is used to define the
parameters of the fitting model. In Artemis there are six
kinds of parameters:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Guess <br>
Guess parameters are the ones that are optimize during the
course of the fit to best-fit the theory to the data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Def Def parameters are typically
expressed as math expressions which may be functionally
dependant upon other parameters. These math expressions are
updated throughout the <br>
course of the fit. As the guess parameters are update, so
are the def parameters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Set Set parameters are evaluated
at the beginning of the fit and not updated throughout the
fit. This is the main difference between def and set
parameters. Set parameters can <br>
be numbers or math expressions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Restraint <br>
Restraints are math expressions which, like def parameters,
are updated throughout the course of the fit, but which take
on a special role in the fit. A restraint is <br>
evaluated and added in quadrature to the evaluation of the
chi-square parameter. A restraint, therefore, can be used to
incorporate a a bias in the fitting result towards a <br>
piece of prior knowledge about the physical system. See the
Ifeffit for a complete discussion of restraints.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Skip <br>
Skip parameters are maintained in the project but are not
used in any capacity in the fit. The point of a skip
parameter is to maintain but not use a complicated parameter
<br>
with a complicated math expression.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After <br>
An after is similar to a def parameter in that it may be a
math expression dependent upon other parameters. An after is
not, however, a part of the fitting model. Instead <br>
it is a parameter that will be evaluated upon completion of
the fit using the best fit values. The list of after
parameters will be reported in the log file. Using an after
<br>
parameter anywhere in your fitting model will result in
Artemis reporting an error in the model. Afters can depend
upon other afters, but you should take care in with the <br>
order that the afters appear in the list. The after
parameters will be evaulated only once after the fit, thus
circular or out-of-order dependencies will not be
resolved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Guess, Def, Set page is
divided into two sections. At the top is a listbox
containing the list of all defined parameters. At the bottom
is the edit area which contains the <br>
controls used to establish the parameters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The parameter listbox <br>
This area contains a four-column list of all the parameters
defined in a project. The left-most column counts the
parameters. The second column contains a tag identifying the
<br>
type of the parameter. The third column contains the
parameter name. The right-most column contains the
parameter&rsquo;s math expression.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Parameters are coded by color
and by the tag in the second column. Guess parameters are
written in purple text and have the &quot;g:&quot; tag. Def
parameters are written in green text <br>
and have the &quot;d:&quot; tag. Set parameters are written
in black text and have the &quot;s:&quot; tag. Restraints
are written in pink text and have the &quot;r:&quot; tag.
Skip parameters are written <br>
in grey text and have no tag. After parameters are written
in blue-grey text and have the &quot;a:&quot; tag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are a large number of
mouse clicks and key sequences that serve a purpose in the
listbox:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. A left mouse click selects a
parameter and displays it in the edit area.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. A double click of the left
mouse button selects a parameter, displays it in the edit
area, and prompts you for the parameter annotation. See
&quot;Parameter annotations&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. A right mouse click selects a
parameter, displays it in the edit area, and posts a
contextual menu about that parameter. The menu has several
items in it. The &quot;Move&quot; <br>
submenu is sued to reposition the current parameter in the
list. The &quot;Make&quot; submenu serves to change the type
of the parameter. The &quot;Copy&quot; item will replicate
the anchored <br>
parameter, appending a few characters to the end of its
name. The &quot;Build restraint&quot; item is discussed
below. The &quot;Annotate&quot; menu item prompts for the
parameter annotation. <br>
The &quot;Find&quot; menu item will search through all
parameter and path parameter math expressions and show you
how that parameter is used in the project. The
&quot;Grab&quot; menu item is <br>
only enabled for guess parameters and will insert the
best-fit value from a fit as the value for that parameter.
Finally the &quot;Discard&quot; menu item will remove that
parameter <br>
from the list after prompting for confirmation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. Control-d will define the
parameter in the edit area.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5. Control-g will grab the
current parameters best-fit value from a fit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6. Control-e will show the
editing area if it is hidden.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">7. Control-k and control-j will
move the selection up and down in the list. Note that these
two key-sequences serve to move the anchor up and down in
the Data and Path List <br>
when the Guess, Def, Set page is not showing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">8. Control-n will clear the
selection and focus on the parameter name entry box so that
you can create a new parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">9. Control-y will prompt you to
then hit any of the g, d, s, r, k or e keys to set the type
of the parameter. This is only way of setting the parameter
type that does not <br>
involve the mouse.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Extended selection <br>
Multiple items in the list of parameters can be selected
using the control-click, shift-click, and click-drag
sequences described for the Data and Paths List and for the
log <br>
viewer. Only the anchored list item (i.e. the one
surreounded by a dashed line and displayed in the edit area)
can have its name and math expression edited.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The advantage of extended
selection is that certain of the context menu options
discussed above in item #3 can operate on many parameters at
once. By doing extended selection <br>
then clicking the right mouse button somewhere in the
selected region, the context menu will be posted with
options for the group of selected parameters. Currently,
groups of <br>
parameters can have their types set and can be discarded in
this manner.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you right-click outside the
selected region, the extended selection will be cleared and
the parameter clicked on will be anchored and selected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The edit area <br>
There are three rows of controls in the edit area. The top
row has two entry boxes. The smaller one on the left is for
entering the name of the parameter. The larger one on <br>
the right is for entering the parameter&rsquo;s math
expression.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Below the entry boxes are a set
of five radiobuttons for selecting the type of parameter
being edited.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At the bottom of the edit area
are five buttons for acting upon the parameter being edited.
The &quot;Undo edit&quot; button clears the entry boxes and
discards whatever changes were just <br>
made. The &quot;New&quot; button is used to define a brand
new parameter. It clears the entry boxes, unselects
parameters in the listbox, and gives focus to entry box for
entering the <br>
parameter name. The &quot;Grab&quot; button becomes enabled
after a fit is run. It inserts the best-fit value for a
guess parameter. The &quot;Discard&quot; button deletes a
parameter from the <br>
list. A dialog pops up confirming deletion. Finally, the
&quot;Hide&quot; button removes the edit area from view to
allow more parameters to be visible in the listbox. When the
edit <br>
area is hidden, it is replaced by a button for restoring the
edit area.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here are the details of the
behavior of these controls:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. Hitting return in the
parameter name entry box defines the parameter, inserts or
updates it in the listbox, and puts focus on the math
expression entry box. If a math <br>
expression has not yet been defined, the parameter will be
defined as 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Hitting return in the math
expression entry box defines the parameter, inserts or
updates it in the listbox, and leaves focus on the math
expression entry box.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. Clicking on any of the
radiobuttons defines the the parameter, inserts or updates
it in the listbox, and leaves the focus unchanged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Parameter annotations <br>
An annotation is a short text string that is associated with
the parameter. This string is written to the echo area
whenever the parameter is selected in the listbox on the
<br>
Guess, Def, Set page. The purpose of he annotation is to
write a little hint about the role played by the parameter
in the fiting model. If a guess parameters has no annotation
<br>
when a fit is run, its annotation will be generated
automatically. The automatic annotation for a guess
parameter is its best fit value +/- its error bar. The
automatic <br>
annotation for a def, after, or restrain parameter is its
evaluated value after the fit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Building restraints <br>
One of the items in the context menu displayed when
right-clicking on a parameter is for building restraints
based on guess or def parameters. This tool provides a
dialog for <br>
constructing one particular type of restraint -- the type
that coerces a parameter to stay within a boundries for its
value. The dialog prompts for a minimum and maximum value
<br>
and for a term called the &quot;amplifier&quot;. The math
expression constructed is this one:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">restrain param_res =
penalty(param, min, max) * amp</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The penalty function evaluates
to 0 when &quot;param&quot; is between &quot;min&quot; and
&quot;max&quot;, to &quot;abs(min-param)&quot; when
&quot;param&quot; is less than &quot;min&quot;, and to
&quot;abs(param-max)&quot; when &quot;param&quot; is greater
<br>
than &quot;max&quot;. This is added in quadrature to reduced
chi-square as the fit is evaluated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The amplifier term determines
the magnitude of the penalty. A large value for
&quot;amp&quot; will force the fitted value of
&quot;param&quot; not to stray too far outside its bounds. A
small <br>
value will allow the fit more freedom to let
&quot;param&quot; deviate from your initial guess.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See the Ifeffit FAQ, question
8.1 for more discussion of restraints, including discussion
of other ways to set restraints that do not involve the
&quot;penalty()&quot; function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A cautionary note: restraints
are not always appropriate. As an example, if a fit is
returning a negative value for sigma^2, it may not be
appropriate to apply a stiff restraint <br>
as a way of forcing that sigma^2 to be a value that you
expect. Often, a negative sigma^2 is indicative of some
other problem in the fitting model such as excessive
structural <br>
disorder, a coordination number that is forced to be too
small, the incorrect atomic species for a backscatterer, or
some such. Using a restraint on sigma^2 in a case like this
<br>
would not fix the problem. Quite the opposite, it might
foster a false sense of accomplishment by &quot;fixing&quot;
the sigma^2 &quot;problem&quot; without actually addressing
the actual problem <br>
in the fitting model.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Highlighting <br>
There is an option in the GDS menu for highlighting
parameters. This prompts you for a text string. Any
parameter names or math expressions that match that string
will be <br>
marked with a green background. This is particularly useful
for large parameter lists. The text string is interpreted as
a perl regular expression and so any valid perl <br>
metacharacters can be used. (This includes regular
expressions using &quot;(?{ code })&quot; and other similar
constructions, a practice the author of Artemis does not
recommend, but does <br>
not prevent.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Importing and exporting text
files <br>
For large, complex fitting models, it may be convenient to
edit the parameter list with a text editor or even to write
a program which generates the parameters and writes them to
<br>
a text file. In that case, it is convenient to be able to
import and export a textual respresentation of the parameter
list. These files are of a simple format. Any line like <br>
these:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">guess a 5 <br>
set b 6 <br>
def c a+b</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">can imported to and exported
from the Guess, Def, Set page via the GDS menu. In an
imported file, any line beginning with any of
&quot;guess&quot;, &quot;def&quot;, &quot;set&quot;,
&quot;restrain&quot;, &quot;after&quot;, or <br>
&quot;skip&quot; will be imported as a parameter. The second
word on the line will be taken as the parameter name and the
remaining words on the line will be concatinated to form the
math <br>
expression. On export lines will follow this format:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">type name = math_expression</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Very little error checking is
performed upon import to verify that the parameter is
defined sensibly, so use this feature with caution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ARTEMIS: ATOMS, The
Crystallographic Front End to FEFF <br>
ARTEMIS - ATOMS, The Crystallographic Front End to FEFF</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The purpose of Atoms is to
generate a &quot;feff.inp&quot; file from crystallographic
data. The hard part of making a &quot;feff.inp&quot; file is
creating the long list of atomic coordinates. <br>
Atoms thus makes the hard part of running Feff easy, at
least for crystalline matrials.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This page can be used to create
input data for Atoms from scratch. It will also be used to
display crystallography data imported from an
&quot;atoms.inp&quot; file or a CIF file. To <br>
import an &quot;atoms.inp&quot; file or CIF file, use the
normal file import dialog.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The title box <br>
At the top is a text box for entering title lines
identifying the crystallographic data. These lines will be
written to the &quot;feff.inp&quot; file and to the top of
the Feff <br>
interpretation page. This is a good place to cite the
literature reference or to provide other important
information about the crystal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Crystal parameters <br>
To the left side of the page are entry boxes for entering
space group, lattice constants, and lattice angles of the
crystal. A space group must always be provided. Atoms is
<br>
very flexible about how the space group symbol is entered.
You can use the Hermann-Maguin or Scheonflies symbols or the
index of the space group from the International Tables. <br>
The algorithm that interprets the symbol is insensitive to
white space and capitalization -- &quot;P m -3 m&quot; and
&quot;PM-3M&quot; are interpreted the same. For complete
details about how the <br>
symbols are interpreted, see the Atoms docuemntation on
Bruce&rsquo;s web site.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Lattice constants are entered in
units of Angstroms, angles are entered as decimal numbers in
degrees (and not in arc minutes -- i.e. 89 and a half
degrees is entered as 89.5 <br>
rather than 89&rsquo;30&quot;). Many space groups have
symmetries that make some lattice angles and constants the
same. In those situations, it is only necesary to fill in
the essential <br>
values. For instance, a cubic space group only requires a
value for the &quot;a&quot; constant. Atoms will know to set
the other lattice constants the same and to set the angles
to 90 <br>
degrees. For lower symmetry groups, you must provide all the
necessary information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Below the lattice constants are
entry boxes for &quot;Rmax&quot; and the shift vector and a
menu for selecting the absorption edge of the Feff
calculation. &quot;Rmax&quot; is the radial extent of <br>
the cluster that will be written to the &quot;feff.inp&quot;
file. Some space groups are given in the International
Tables with two different origins -- i.e. the origin is
placed at sites <br>
with two different point symmetries. The fractional
coordinates of the sites are different for the two different
settings of the crystal. In those cases, Atoms requires that
<br>
you use a particular one of the two choices. If your input
data has used the other origin choice, it should be fairly
obvious. In that case, coordination numbers and distances
<br>
to the coordination shells will usually be obviously wrong.
When you use one of the space groups for which two origin
choices exist, Artemis will issue a warning. If you <br>
suspect that the wrong origin choice has been used, insert
the values for the shift vector that were reported in the
warning message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On occassion, crystals are
reported in the literature using origins other than the
standard one used in the International Tables. A famous
example is germanium oxide. Here is <br>
the crystal data for GeO2:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">title GeO2 (hexagonal) <br>
space p 32 2 1 <br>
a=4.98502 c=5.64800 <br>
rmax=6.0 core=Ge <br>
shift 0 0 0.66667 <br>
atoms <br>
Ge 0.4513 0.0 0.0 <br>
O 0.3969 0.3021 0.0909</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For some reason, the
crystallography reference for this material uses an origin
that is shifted by 2/3 in the z direction relative to the
origin used in the International Tables. <br>
To get Atoms to compute this structure correctly, the shift
vector given above must be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The atoms list <br>
To the right side of the page is the list of unique
crystallographic sites. As new sites are created, they are
inserted into the list. The sites are not edited directly,
<br>
instead the editing area at the bottom of the screen is used
and the list of all sites is displayed here. This works much
the same as the Guess, Def, Set page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To edit a site, left-click on
its entry in the list. It&rsquo;s element symbols,
coordinates, and site tag will be displayed in the edit
area. A right click on a site in the list <br>
will post a context menu with several functions that can be
perfromed on that site. You can re-order the list using the
&quot;Move&quot; menu item. A site can be copied and the
copy <br>
added to the list using the &quot;Copy&quot; menu item. The
&quot;Discard&quot; menu item completely removes the site
from the list. The list supports extended selection. When
many sites are <br>
selected (i.e. highlighted in yellow), the
&quot;Discard&quot; menu item will work on all the selected
sites.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sites can also be reordered
using the keyboard. &quot;Alt-k&quot; and &quot;Alt-j&quot;
can be used to move the selected site up or down in the
list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The edit area <br>
At the bottom of the page is the collection of widgets used
to actually create and edit unique crystallographic sites.
The element box is used to insert the two-letter element
<br>
symbol for the site. The site will not be created if this is
not a valid symbol. The tag can be any 10-letter string used
to identify the site. The tag is used to <br>
differentiate sites that contain the same element.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The boxes for the &quot;x&quot;,
&quot;y&quot;, and &quot;z&quot; coordinates can be filled
with floating point numbers or simple fractions. That is,
0.5 and &quot;1/2&quot; are both acceptable. These
coordinates are <br>
fractional positions in the unit cell and are not Cartesian
coordinates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once you have created all sites
in your crystal, click the &quot;Run Atoms&quot; button.
This will process the crystallographic data, create the
&quot;feff.inp&quot; file, display the &quot;feff.inp&quot;
<br>
page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Atoms template files <br>
The &quot;feff.inp&quot; data that is generated when the
&quot;Run Atoms&quot; button is pressed is determined by the
contents of a special template file. Artemis is distributed
with a number of <br>
template files serving different purposes. The structure of
the &quot;feff.inp&quot; data is set by the value of the
&quot;atoms-&gt;template&quot; preference. The default value
is &quot;feff&quot;, which <br>
tells Artemis to use the template file suitable for running
Feff6.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to run some other
version of Feff, you should set the
&quot;atoms-&gt;template&quot; preference variable to the
appropriate value. Templates are provided with Artemis for
writing <br>
Feff7 and Feff8 input files. Feff8 input files can be
written which are suitable for XANES or non-self-consistent
EXAFS calculations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sometimes, it is useful to
modify template files for writing out specialized
&quot;feff.inp&quot; data. If these modified template files
are placed in &quot;~/.horae/atp/&quot; (unix) or
&quot;C:Program <br>
FilesIfeffitaetp&quot; (windows), Artemis will be able to
find them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Final note <br>
A full explanation of how the Atoms algorithms works is
beyond the scope of this document page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ARTEMIS: The FEFF Input File
<br>
ARTEMIS - The FEFF input file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This page displays the Feff
input data, which includes some control parameters and a
long list of atomic coordinates. This page is no more
sophisticated than a text box which <br>
serves as a primitive editor and a button at the bottom for
running Feff. Explaining Feff is beyond the scope of this
document.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When feff is finished, you will
presented with a dialog asking how many paths to import. The
choices are none, the first path, the first 10 paths, and
all paths. The number in <br>
the third option is configurable in the preferences dialog.
Should you ever need to rerun Feff after starting a project,
&quot;none&quot; is usually the right answer. The other
options <br>
may result in one or more paths being defined twice in the
project -- a confusing situation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If Feff fails to run to
completion, Artemis will try to recognize the problem and
post a suggestion for how to solve the problem. If Artemis
does not recognize your problem, <br>
explain it Bruce so he can add that problem to
Artemis&rsquo;s database of troubleshooting solutions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ARTEMIS: Interpretation of the
FEFF Calculation <br>
ARTEMIS - Interpretation of the FEFF calculation</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This page provides a concise
overview of the Feff calculation. At the top of the page is
a summary of some of the statistics of the calculation.
Below that is a chart showing <br>
the details of each path from the calculation. For each
path, the degeneracy, the half path length and the amplitude
factor are shown. The last column shows a tokenized summary
<br>
of the scattering path -- this allows you to see at a glance
which atoms were involved in the path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The information and context
menus available on this page allow you organize, understand,
and manipulate the paths in this Feff calculation. Pretty
much all functions involving <br>
the paths except writing math expressions for the path
parameters are available on this page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The interpretation chart <br>
The colors and fonts used in the chart convey
information:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bold, black font <br>
These are paths that have been imported into the project and
are included in the fit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bold, brown font <br>
These are paths that have been imported into the project but
are excluded in the fit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normal, black text <br>
These are paths that have not been imported into the project
but which are available to be imported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normal, grey text <br>
These are paths that are unavailable for importation into
the project. These can be made available by re-running the
Feff calculation. After the Feff run, it is best to <br>
choose the &quot;import no paths&quot; to avoid reimporting
paths already in the project. After that, these paths will
be written in normal, black text, indicating that they are
<br>
available for import.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Light brown background <br>
The light brown background is used to indicate single
scattering paths.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Light blue background <br>
The light blue background is used to indicate collinear or
nearly collinear multiple scattering paths.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Context menus <br>
There are interesting and useful context menus on every part
of this page. These menus are available by right
clicking.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Right clicking anywhere in the
text box at the top of the page will pop up a menu with
options for viewing files from the Feff calculation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Right clicking in the
interpretation chart will post a menu of options relevant to
the path on the line on which you clicked. Each of the four
kinds of paths given by the four <br>
fonts described above has its own menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For paths that are imported in
the fit, the menu offers options for plotting the path,
displaying that path&rsquo;s page, including or excluding
the path in the fit, selecting or <br>
deselecting that path for plotting, making that path the
default for evaluation of def parameters after a fit,
displaying the text of the file containing the path, or
discarding <br>
the path. The choices for including or excluding and for
selecting or deselecting depend on the state of that path in
the Data and Paths List. Also some options might be greyed
<br>
out depending on the state of that path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For paths that have not been
imported into the project, the context menu allows you to
import the path with the option of displaying its page or
leaving the display on the Feff <br>
interpretation. For paths that are unavailable for import, a
message saying so is posted when one of those lines is
right-clicked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The interpretation chart allows
for extended selection of lines in the chart. You can select
additional paths by holding the control key while clicking
with the left mouse <br>
button. Holding the shift key while left clicking selects
all line between the anchor (the one outlined with a dashed
line) and the one you click on. You can also click and <br>
drag to select all the lines you drag over. When more than
one line is selected, the content of the context menu change
to reflect functionality that makes sense for many paths.
<br>
Extended selection in the interpretation chart is therefore
a good way of including/excluding, selecting/deselecting, or
plotting a large number of paths.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The context menu that pops up
when many lines are selected may be a little surprising. Its
contents depend upon the state of the anchored line, which
in this case is the one <br>
that you right-click on to post the menu. The options in the
context menu will be suitable to the state of the anchored
selection regardless of the states of the other selected
<br>
lines. If you choose a menu item that does not make sense
for some of the selected lines, those lines will be
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here is a concrete example.
Suppose that you select a number of lines, some of which are
included in the fit and some of which have not been imported
in the fit. If you then <br>
right click on one of the included paths, you will get
options appropriate to included paths. If you then ask to
plot the selected paths along with the data, the included
paths <br>
will be plotted and the imported paths will be ignored. If,
instead, you click on one of the paths that has not been
imported yet, the context menu will give you the option of
<br>
importing the selected paths. In that case, the paths that
have already been imported will be ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Trouble shooting <br>
On occassion you might see that lines in the Feff
interpretation do not properly report on the contents of the
path. When this happens, site tags are replaced by this
string: <br>
&quot;&lt;?&gt;&quot;. There are a couple common reasons you
might see the &quot;&lt;?&gt;&quot; tags:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. You have done some advanced
voodoo with Feff, editing the &quot;files.dat&quot; or
&quot;paths.dat&quot; files then rerunning the last module
to produce specialized output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. You have discovered a bug in
the algorithm Artemis uses to harvest information from the
Feff calculation. IN that case, you should send the
&quot;feff.inp&quot; file or the Artemis <br>
project file to Bruce so he can fix the problem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the appearance of the
&quot;&lt;?&gt;&quot; tags is probably not an indication
that Feff has misbehaved. The Feff calculation has to run to
completion and generate its normal output <br>
before this problem can manifest itself. The Feff
calculation is almost certainly usable to analyze the data.
The Feff interpretation page is Artemis&rsquo;s attempt to
organize <br>
information about the Feff calculation in some user-friendly
format. That this organizational effort failed is not
necessarily an indication that Feff failed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ARTEMIS: The Path Page <br>
ARTEMIS - The path page</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The path page is displayed
whenever a Feff path is selected from the Data and Paths
List. This page is used to establish the math expressions of
the path parameters for this <br>
path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At the top of the page is a line
identifying which Feff calculation this path is from. Below
that are three toggles. One is used to include of inlcude or
exclude the path from <br>
use in the fit. There are many other ways in Artemis to
include and exclude paths other than to use this toggle. See
The Feff interpretation page and &quot;artemis_menubar&quot;
for more <br>
discussion of this. Also Control-t is the same as clicking
this toggle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The second toggle is used to
specify paths that you would like plotted after a fit (or
sum of paths) is finished. By default, the data and the fit
(or sum) is plotted after the <br>
fit (or sum) and no paths are plotted. Any paths selected
for plotting will be added to the plot after the fit (or
sum) is finished.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The third toggle is used to set
which path is the default path for evaluation of Def
parameters after the fit. It is possible to write math
expressions which evaluate <br>
differently for different paths. An example might be a math
expression using the &quot;reff&quot; parameter. For any
such Def parameters, it is necessary to tell Artemis which
path <br>
should be used for the reporting of those parameters in the
log file. The default is to use the first path listed in the
Data and Paths List.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Below that is a box which
summarizes the path. This gives some statistics about the
path as well as displaying a color-coded &quot;map&quot; of
the scattering path. The central atom is <br>
always displayed in red text. Other atoms are in black text.
The grey text shows the length and scattering angle of each
leg of the path. In the case of a high-order multiple <br>
scattering path which has legs which have a non-zero
Eulerian eta angle between them, the eta angle will be
displayed as well. If that last sentence was gibberish, it
suffices <br>
to know that paths of that sort are almost never observable
in real EXAFS data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At the bottom of the page is the
list of path parameters. This is the most important section
of the page because it is here that the details of the
fitting model are realized. <br>
There is an entry box for each of the various types of path
parameters. The math expression approporiate for each
parameter should be entered in the entry box.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a Feff calculation is
imported into Artemis, a set of automatic parameters are
generated, entered into the list on the Guess, Def, Set
page, and entered into the path <br>
parameetr boxes for each path imported. The default behavior
of Artemis is to generate a set of parameters appropriate
for a simple, single scattering, first shell fit. While <br>
it might be OK to immediately click the big green button,
most fitting models will require substantial editing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The right mouse button serves
many important purposes on the path page. Clicking the right
mouse button anywhere in one of the entry boxes will
highlight the word underneath the <br>
cursor and post a menu. The entries in the menu are for for
defining the word as a parameter on the Guess, Def, Set
page. For each parameter type there is the option of jumping
<br>
or staying. In either case, the parameter is defined and
added to the list on the GDS page. For jumping, the GDS page
is then displayed. For staying, the current path page <br>
remains displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Right clicking on one of the
path parameter labels will post a menu of functions related
to defining path parameter math expressions. The
&quot;Edit&quot; option will pop up a dialog used <br>
for entering a math expression and then optionally exporting
its value to other paths. The &quot;Clear&quot; option doies
just that.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The various &quot;Export&quot;
options are ways of constraining path parameters to be the
same for other paths. The &quot;Grab&quot; options make the
current path parameter the same as the path <br>
parameter in the previous or following path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;sigma^2&quot; label
has some additional options. These insert the syntactically
correct text appropriate to using either the Correlated
Debye or single frequency Einstein models <br>
for the sigma^2 of the path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To enable the display of spaces
for the &quot;dphase&quot;, &quot;k_array&quot;,
&quot;amp_array&quot;, or &quot;phase_array&quot; path
parameters, you must click on the &quot;Extended path
parameters&quot; button in the Paths <br>
menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ARTEMIS: The Log Viewer <br>
ARTEMIS - The log viewer</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a fit is anchored in the
Data and Paths list, the log file viewer is displayed in the
main panel. The purpose of this page is to examine log files
from the most recent fit <br>
or from previous fits. These log files can be read
individually or reports can be generated based on their
contents.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When this page is displayed,
each fit is entered into the list box on the left side of
the page. Double clicking the left mouse button on a fit in
the listbox will display that <br>
fit&rsquo;s raw log file. Right clicking on a fit will post
a menu with choices for displaying that fit&rsquo;s log file
in raw, quick, or columnar form or for performing some other
tasks <br>
related to that fit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Much more interesting than
displaying the log files, though, is to generate reports on
the log files. Near the top of the page is a combo box for
selecting among the parameters <br>
on the Guess, Def, Set page. Choosing one, then clicking on
the &quot;Write report&quot; button will find extract that
parameters best-fit value and uncertainty from each log
file. This <br>
feature allows you to track the evolution of individual
fitting parameters as you develop your fitting model.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The combo box containing the
names of the fitting parameters is filled using the contents
of the Guess, Def, Set page. Sometimes it may be useful
instead to fill the combo box <br>
with the parameter names extracted from a log file. This
would be useful, for instance, for examining a parameter
that is was used at one point, but is no longer on the GDS
page <br>
or has been made into a skip parameter (and so is not
included in the combo box by default). To do this, right
click on a fit and select the &quot;Get parameter list&quot;
item.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some modifications can be made
to the reports generated by the log viewer. Clicking on the
&quot;Compute the average value&quot; button tells Artemis
to compute the arithmetic mean and <br>
standard deviation of the parameter from the values
extracted from the various log files. These will be
displayed in the header of the report.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Clicking on the &quot;Fit
Einstein temperature&quot; button will tell Artemis to fit
sigma^2 data to a model consisting of a single frequency
oscillator plus a constant offset. The report <br>
header will then contain the best fit values and
uncertainties for the characteristic temperature and
constant offset. This calculation will only happen is the
figures of merit <br>
for the selected log files are temperatures and the best fit
values for the chosen parameter are reasonable sigma^2
values. This function makes a series of checks on the
figures <br>
of merit and best fit values to determine if they seem to be
data appropriate for this calculation. These heuristics can
be tuned by setting parameters in the logview section of
<br>
the preferences dialog.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The final item in the context
menu that is displayed when right clicking on an item in the
log files list is an option to restore that fitting model.
Among the information that <br>
is saved every time a fit is made is a complete description
of the fitting model, including which data file is being
fit, the complete list of Feff path used, and all fitting,
<br>
data, and path parameters. This feature allow you to revert
Artemis to the state it was in when a past fit was made.
When you do this reversion, Artemis will clear out the <br>
contents of the Data and Paths List and then recreate the
project in the form of the selected fitting model. This is
more that just a change of parameter values. Artemis keeps
<br>
track of all data and Feff paths used throughout the course
of the project and can restore even fits that are
significantly different from the current fit.</p>

three big, red buttons. One is for making a plot in k-space,
one is for R-space, and the third is for q-space (i.e.
back-transformed k-space).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">k-Weighting <br>
Below the plot buttons are a set of radiobuttons for setting
the k-weight to use in the plots. The k-weight chosen will
be used to weight a plot in k-space or to weight data for
<br>
Fourier transforming. The same k-weight is used for each
selected item. The button marked &quot;kw&quot; needs some
explanation. When this button is chosen, the k-weight to use
in the <br>
plot will be determined from the data being plotted. If the
arbitrary k-weight enabled for the data set,the value for
the arbitrary k-weight will be used, other wise the <br>
smallest k-weight value enabled will be used. There are two
reason to use the &quot;kw&quot; button. One is to plot
using your arbitrary weight. The other is to make a plot of
two or <br>
more data sets using a different k-weight for each data
set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that these k-weight
controls are unrelated to the controls which set the
k-weight used in the fit. K-weighting for fitting and
plotting are controlled independently.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Selecting What Gets Plotted <br>
Below the k-weight radiobuttons are menus for choosing which
part of the complex functions chi(R) or chi(q) to plot.
Plots involving multiple parts of the complex functions <br>
(e.g. real+envelope) are not currently possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Below these menus are three
checkbuttons used for plotting the Fourier transform window,
the background function, and the residual. If the window
button is pressed, the <br>
appropriate window function will be plotted in any plot. The
background and residual functions are only plotted if one of
the selected items is a fit. The background will only <br>
be plotted if a background corefinement was made for that
fit. If a fit is not among the selected items, the
background and residual will not be plotted. Note that a
plot with <br>
more than one selected fit may be quite confusing if the
background or residual buttons are depressed since the
background and residual will be plotted for each fit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ranges over which the plot
will be made in the three spaces are controlled by the three
sets of entry boxes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Extra Plotting Features <br>
The two additional tabs in the plotting panel contain the
controls for the following utilities:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Indicators</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Indicators are vertical bars
that can be placed at user-chosen locations in k-, R-, or
q-space. These indicators will get displayed every time a
plot is made. The idea is that <br>
indicators are a guide to the eye, drawing attention to a
place of interest as the data being plotted changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Indicators selected in either k-
or q-space will be plotted in both k- and q-space, but not
in R-space. Likewise, indicators selected in R-space will
not be plotted in k- or <br>
q-space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Several characteristics of the
indicators, including the number, the linetype, and the
color, can be set in the Plot section of the preferences
dialog.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The indicators play well with
each of the plotting options described below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Stacking</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Stacking refers to a vertical
displacement the various traces. This is most useful for
plotting the various path contributions in k-space, but is
sometimes useful in other kinds <br>
of plots as well. Stacking requires three parameters which
are set in the stacking notecard. The first control is
series of radio buttons for choosing whether stacking
happens <br>
in k-space, always, or never. If the k-space option is
chosen, then q-space plots of the real or imaginary parts
will also be stacked. (Basically, the &quot;k-space&quot;
choice refers <br>
to any wiggly function of wavenumber.) The other two
controls set the initial offset value and the increment
between staces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Inverting</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Inverting is a useful tool for
displaying the path contributions in &quot;|chi(R)|&quot;
plots. When this is selected, the &quot;|chi(R)|&quot; from
any paths included in the plot will be <br>
multiplied by -1 so that they stick down below the
zero-axis. Hopefully this kind of plot help reduce clutter
while still helping to show which paths contribut where. The
<br>
radiobuttons on this notecard allow you choose between never
inverting, inverting &quot;|chi(R)|&quot;, or inverting both
&quot;|chi(R)|&quot; and &quot;|chi(q)|&quot;. The real and
imaginary parts in R- or <br>
q-space are never inverted. chi(k) is also never inverted.
Inverting is turned off whenever stacking is selected and
would effect the current plot (i.e. you cannot stack and
<br>
invert at the same time).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Data set offsets</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This feat ure is useful for
multiple data set plots. This is similar to stacking in that
the parameter denotes a vertical offset for use i the plot.
Each trace associated with <br>
a particular data set is plotted at the same lavel, but the
data sets will be offset by the amount specified by this
control. This provides a way of simultaneously visualizing
<br>
all parts of a multiple data set fit. Negative values are
recommended, with a negative offset, the traces will be
plotted in the same order from top to bottom as in the plot
<br>
legend.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Stacking is disabled when data
set offsets are used. Inverting is used with data set
offsets, although I think this results in confusing
plots.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Palettes || Using the Data and
Paths List || =head1 ARTEMIS: Editing Math Expressions</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ARTEMIS - Editing math
expressions</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The math expression editing
dialog is a way of setting path parameter math expressions
for many paths at once. It works on a given path parameter,
e.g. it sets e0 or sigma^2 for <br>
many paths but does not touch other path parameters. This
dialog is available in two different context menus. If you
right click on a path parameter label on the path page and
<br>
selection &quot;Edit for many paths&quot;, then the dialog
will pop up for editing that parameter. If you right click
on an entry on the Feff interpretation page and select the
&quot;Edit path <br>
parameters&quot; cascade, then select a path parameter, the
dialog will pop up for editing that parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Operation of the dialog <br>
The dialog is fairly simple. At the top is a text entry box
for typing in your math expression. Below that are various
radiobuttons for specifying how to apply the math <br>
expression to the various paths in your project. The options
are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. Add the math expression to
every path in the current Feff calculation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Add the math expression to
every path in the each Feff calculation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. Add the math expression to
every path in the each Feff calculation associated with the
current data set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. Add the math expression to
selected paths (i.e. the ones highlighted in orange in the
Data and Paths list).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tokens <br>
You can write your math expressions using token. Tokens are
short character strings which will be replaced by
path-specific information as the math expression is applied
to each <br>
path. The tokens are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%i The path index from the Feff
calculation. This is actually computed from the name of the
&lsquo;feffNNNN.dat&rsquo; file from the Feff calculation.
For instance, if the file is <br>
&lsquo;feff0029.dat&rsquo;, then %i will expand to 29.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%I The path index from the Feff
calculation, padded to fill four characters. For instance,
if the file is &lsquo;feff0029.dat&rsquo;, then %I will
expand to 0029.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%r The effective path length (or
&quot;reff&quot;) from the Feff calculation for the
path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%d The degeneracy of the
path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%D A template for the Debye
function. This always expands to the string
&quot;debye(temp,thetad)&quot; and may need be edited after
the fact to use the correct variable names. This is <br>
offered because the author finds it hard to remember the
order of the arguments to the Debye function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%E A template for the Einstein
function. This always expands to the string
&quot;eins(temp,thetae)&quot; and may need be edited after
the fact to use the correct variable names. This is <br>
offered because the author finds it hard to remember the
order of the arguments to the Einstein function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ARTEMIS: Automated First Shell
Theory <br>
ARTEMIS - Automated first shell theory</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sometimes thinking about a
fitting model is more than a problem merits. You just want a
quick &rsquo;n&rsquo; dirty stab at the first shell --
perhaps to measure the centroid of the <br>
distribution, perhaps to tell if a sample is 4- or
6-coordinated. Whatever.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Artemis is not extremely well
suited to rapid-fire, first shell analysis. By design,
Artemis tends to force the user to slow down and think hard
about every step. Artemis is <br>
powerful, but she ain&rsquo;t simple.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The quick first shell (QFS)
theory tool is an attempt at addressing this shortcoming. It
works like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. Import some data. Set the
Fourier transform and fitting parameters to suitable values.
Specifically, be sure to set the fitting range such that it
encloses the first peak <br>
of the data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Select &quot;Quick first
shell theory&quot; from the Theory menu. This will display
the QFS dialog.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. The QFS dialog provides
spaces for selecting the parameters for a simple first shell
theory. These include the atomic species of the absorber and
the scatterer, the <br>
absorption edge of the experiment, the approximate distance
between the absorber and scatterer, and the coordination
geometry to use in the Feff calculation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Currently the following
coordination geomatries are available:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; 4-coordinate
crystal</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; 6-coordinate
crystal</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; octahedral
molecule</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; tetrahedral
molecule</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; square-planar
molecule</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The QFS theory is probably not
highly sensitive to the choice of coordination geometry.
Since the unknown sample is probably not well described by
any of these geometries, <br>
they are all merely approximations for use in a quick
&rsquo;n&rsquo; dirty fit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. Once you have set up the
parameters for the QFS theory, click the &quot;Do it!&quot;
button. This will step through the following without
pausing:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a. Build an input file for the
Feff calculation</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">b. Run Feff</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c. Import the first path from
the Feff calculation</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">d. Create a set of guess
parameters for the amplitude, the sigma^2, the e0, and the
delta R. Also created are set parameters for the third and
fourth cumulants, but they <br>
are set to zero. These higher cumulant set parameters are
created to make it easy to consider higher cumulants in
subsequent fits merely by changing them from set to <br>
guess.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you have a mixed first shell,
you might choose to repeat steps 2 through 4 two or more
times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At the end of this sequence, you
are left with Artemis in its normal state. You may need to
adjust the parameters used in the fit. The QFS dialog is
really just a tool for <br>
initially setting up the project. It in no way changes the
normal operation of Artemis.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you import data from an
Athena project file, the species of the absorber and the
edge will be set correctly when you start the dialog.</p>
