xhost - server access control program for X
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<b>xhost</b> [[+-]name ...]
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
The <i>xhost</i> program is used to add and delete host names or user names to
  the list allowed to make connections to the X server. In the case of hosts,
  this provides a rudimentary form of privacy control and security. It is only
  sufficient for a workstation (single user) environment, although it does limit
  the worst abuses. Environments which require more sophisticated measures
  should implement the user-based mechanism or use the hooks in the protocol for
  passing other authentication data to the server.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
<i>Xhost</i> accepts the following command line options described below. For
  security, the options that affect access control may only be run from the
  &quot;controlling host&quot;. For workstations, this is the same machine as
  the server. For X terminals, it is the login host.

  <dd class="It-tag">The given <i>name</i> (the plus sign is optional) is added

      but new connection attempts will be denied. Note that the current machine
      is allowed to be removed; however, further connections (including attempts
      to add it back) will not be permitted. Resetting the server (thereby
      breaking all connections) is the only way to allow local connections
      again.</dd>

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="NAMES"><a class="selflink" href="#NAMES">NAMES</a></h1>
A complete name has the syntax ``family:name'' where the families are as
  follows:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
inet	Internet host (IPv4)
inet6	Internet host (IPv6)
dnet	DECnet host
nis	Secure RPC network name
krb	Kerberos V5 principal
local	contains only one name, the empty string
si	Server Interpreted
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The family is case insensitive. The format of the name varies with the family.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When Secure RPC is being used, the network independent netname (e.g.,
  &quot;nis:unix. <i>uid</i>@<i>domainname</i>&quot;) can be specified, or a
  local user can be specified with just the username and a trailing at-sign
  (e.g., &quot;nis:pat@&quot;).
<div class="Pp"></div>
For backward compatibility with pre-R6 <i>xhost</i>, names that contain an
  at-sign (@) are assumed to be in the nis family. Otherwise they are assumed to
  be Internet addresses. If compiled to support IPv6, then all IPv4 and IPv6
  addresses returned by getaddrinfo(3) are added to the access list in the
  appropriate inet or inet6 family.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The local family specifies all the local connections at once. However, the
  server interpreted address &quot;si:localuser: <i>username</i>&quot; can be
  used to specify a single local user. (See the <i>Xsecurity</i>(7) manual page
  for more details.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
Server interpreted addresses consist of a case-sensitive type tag and a string
  representing a given value, separated by a colon. For example,
  &quot;si:hostname:almas&quot; is a server interpreted address of type
  <i>hostname</i>, with a value of <i>almas</i>. For more information on the
  available forms of server interpreted addresses, see the <i>Xsecurity</i>(7)
  manual page.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The initial access control list for display number <b>n</b> may be set by the
  file <i>/etc/X</i><b>n</b><i>.hosts</i>, where <b>n</b> is the display number
  of the server. See <i>Xserver</i>(1) for details.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DIAGNOSTICS"><a class="selflink" href="#DIAGNOSTICS">DIAGNOSTICS</a></h1>
For each name added to the access control list, a line of the form &quot;
  <i>name</i> being added to access control list&quot; is printed. For each name
  removed from the access control list, a line of the form &quot; <i>name</i>
  being removed from access control list&quot; is printed.

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>DISPLAY</b></dt>

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="BUGS"><a class="selflink" href="#BUGS">BUGS</a></h1>
You can't specify a display on the command line because <b>-display</b> is a
  valid command line argument (indicating that you want to remove the machine
  named <i>``display''</i> from the access list).
<div class="Pp"></div>
The X server stores network addresses, not host names, unless you use the
  server-interpreted hostname type address. If somehow you change a host's
  network address while the server is still running, and you are using a
  network-address based form of authentication, <i>xhost</i> must be used to add
  the new address and/or remove the old address.
