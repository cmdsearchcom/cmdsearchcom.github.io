<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
xhost - server access control program for X</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
xhost [[+-]name ...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The xhost program is used to add and delete host names or
user names to the list allowed to make connections to the X
server. In the case of hosts, this provides a rudimentary
<br>
form of privacy control and security. It is only sufficient
for a workstation (single user) environment, although it
does limit the worst abuses. Environments which require <br>
more sophisticated measures should implement the user-based
mechanism or use the hooks in the protocol for passing other
authentication data to the server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Xhost accepts the following command line options described
below. For security, the options that affect access control
may only be run from the &quot;controlling host&quot;. For
worksta&acirc; <br>
tions, this is the same machine as the server. For X
terminals, it is the login host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-help Prints a usage
message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[+]name The given name (the plus
sign is optional) is added to the list allowed to connect to
the X server. The name can be a host name or a complete name
(See NAMES for more <br>
details).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-name The given name is removed
from the list of allowed to connect to the server. The name
can be a host name or a complete name (See NAMES for more
details). Existing con&acirc; <br>
nections are not broken, but new connection attempts will be
denied. Note that the current machine is allowed to be
removed; however, further connections (including <br>
attempts to add it back) will not be permitted. Resetting
the server (thereby breaking all connections) is the only
way to allow local connections again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+ Access is granted to everyone,
even if they aren&rsquo;t on the list (i.e., access control
is turned off).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Access is restricted to only
those on the list (i.e., access control is turned on).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nothing If no command line
arguments are given, a message indicating whether or not
access control is currently enabled is printed, followed by
the list of those allowed to con&acirc; <br>
nect. This is the only option that may be used from machines
other than the controlling host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAMES <br>
A complete name has the syntax
&lsquo;&lsquo;family:name&rsquo;&rsquo; where the families
are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">inet Internet host (IPv4) <br>
inet6 Internet host (IPv6) <br>
dnet DECnet host <br>
nis Secure RPC network name <br>
krb Kerberos V5 principal <br>
local contains only one name, the empty string <br>
si Server Interpreted</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The family is case insensitive.
The format of the name varies with the family.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When Secure RPC is being used,
the network independent netname (e.g.,
&quot;nis:unix.uid@domainname&quot;) can be specified, or a
local user can be specified with just the username and a
<br>
trailing at-sign (e.g., &quot;nis:pat@&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For backward compatibility with
pre-R6 xhost, names that contain an at-sign (@) are assumed
to be in the nis family. Otherwise they are assumed to be
Internet addresses. If com&acirc; <br>
piled to support IPv6, then all IPv4 and IPv6 addresses
returned by getaddrinfo(3) are added to the access list in
the appropriate inet or inet6 family.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The local family specifies all
the local connections at once. However, the server
interpreted address &quot;si:localuser:username&quot; can be
used to specify a single local user. (See the <br>
Xsecurity(7) manual page for more details.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Server interpreted addresses
consist of a case-sensitive type tag and a string
representing a given value, separated by a colon. For
example, &quot;si:hostname:almas&quot; is a server <br>
interpreted address of type hostname, with a value of almas.
For more information on the available forms of server
interpreted addresses, see the Xsecurity(7) manual page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The initial access control list
for display number n may be set by the file /etc/Xn.hosts,
where n is the display number of the server. See Xserver(1)
for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
For each name added to the access control list, a line of
the form &quot;name being added to access control list&quot;
is printed. For each name removed from the access control
list, a <br>
line of the form &quot;name being removed from access
control list&quot; is printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
X(7), Xsecurity(7), Xserver(1), xdm(1), xauth(1),
getaddrinfo(3)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
DISPLAY to get the default host and display to use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
You can&rsquo;t specify a display on the command line
because -display is a valid command line argument
(indicating that you want to remove the machine named
&lsquo;&lsquo;display&rsquo;&rsquo; from the <br>
access list).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The X server stores network
addresses, not host names, unless you use the
server-interpreted hostname type address. If somehow you
change a host&rsquo;s network address while the <br>
server is still running, and you are using a network-address
based form of authentication, xhost must be used to add the
new address and/or remove the old address.</p>
