<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pamtofits - convert a Netpbm image into FITS format</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pamtofits [-max f] [-min f] [pamfile]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This program is part of Netpbm(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pamtofits reads a PNM or PAM
image as input and produces a FITS (Flexible Image Transport
System) file as output. The resolution of the output file is
either 8 bits/pixel, or 16 <br>
bits/pixel, depending on the value of maxval in the input
file. If the input file is a PBM or PGM image, the output
file consists of a single plane image (NAXIS = 2). If
instead <br>
the input file is a PPM image, the output file will consist
of a three-plane image (NAXIS = 3, NAXIS3 = 3).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-min and -max tell pamtofits what &rsquo;physical
values&rsquo; zero and maxval sample values, respectively,
in the input image represent. Physical values are a FITS
concept. pamtofits <br>
sets up the BSCALE and BZERO FITS header cards to indicate
this information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default for -min is 0 and
for -max is the maxval, which means if you don&rsquo;t
specify these options, the FITS physical values are in fact
the original Netpbm sample values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pamtofits always sets up the
FITS header DATAMIN and DATAMAX cards to indicate that the
highest physical value in the image is the one corresponding
to the Netpbm maxval and the <br>
lowest is that corresponding to Netpbm zero. This
isn&rsquo;t really how those cards are supposed to be used,
since the input image doesn&rsquo;t necessarily contain the
full possible range <br>
of sample values. It is a conservative approximation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
Pixel Order <br>
The FITS specification does not specify which data in the
file corresponds to which pixel in the image (i.e. which
bytes are the top left pixel, etc.). Netpbm uses the common
<br>
sense, most popular arrangement: row major, top to bottom,
left to right. That means in a 10 wide by 20 high image, the
first 10 pixels in the file are the top row and the last
<br>
10 are the bottom row. Within each row, the first pixel is
the leftmost one and the last pixel is the rightmost
one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Netpbm has always done that,
since it first understood the FITS format in 1989, so it is
something of a de facto standard. Nobody reported trouble
with that until 2008.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, at least some versions
of ImageMagick and Gimp (as seen in 2008) use bottom to top
order, so if you use display a FITS image generated by
pamtofits, it will appear <br>
upside down. To fix that, use pamflip -topbottom on the
image before feeding it to pamtofits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since 2008, people have noted
that NASA distributes FITS files with bottom to top
order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY <br>
pamtofits was originally pnmtofits and did not handle PAM
input. It was extended and renamed in Netpbm 10.30 (October
2005).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pnmtofits was itself an
extension of pgmtofits, which was added to Pbmplus in
1989.</p>
