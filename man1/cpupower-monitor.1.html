CPUPOWER-MONITOR(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
cpupower-monitor - Report processor frequency and idle
statistics</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
cpupower monitor -l</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cpupower monitor [-c][-m
&lt;mon1&gt;,[&lt;mon2&gt;,...]] [-i seconds] <br>
cpupower monitor [-c][-m &lt;mon1&gt;,[&lt;mon2&gt;,...]]
command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
cpupower-monitor reports processor topology, frequency and
idle power state statistics. Either command is forked and
statistics are printed upon its completion, or statistics
<br>
are printed periodically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cpupower-monitor implements
independent processor sleep state and frequency counters.
Some are retrieved from kernel statistics, some are directly
reading out hardware regis&acirc; <br>
ters. Use -l to get an overview which are supported on your
system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options <br>
-l <br>
List available monitors on your system. Additional details
about each monitor are shown:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The name in
quotation marks which can be passed to the -m parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The number of
different counters the monitor supports in brackets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The amount of
time in seconds the counters might overflow, due to
implementation constraints.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The name and a
description of each counter and its processor hierarchy
level coverage in square brackets:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; [T] -&gt;
Thread</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; [C] -&gt;
Core</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; [P] -&gt;
Processor Package (Socket)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; [M] -&gt;
Machine/Platform wide counter</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m &lt;mon1&gt;,&lt;mon2&gt;,...
<br>
Only display specific monitors. Use the monitor string(s)
provided by -l option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i seconds <br>
Measure intervall.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c <br>
Schedule the process on every core before starting and
ending measuring. This could be needed for the Idle_Stats
monitor when no other MSR based monitor (has to be run on
<br>
the core that is measured) is run in parallel. This is to
wake up the processors from deeper sleep states and let the
kernel re -account its cpuidle (C-state) information <br>
before reading the cpuidle timings from sysfs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">command <br>
Measure idle and frequency characteristics of an arbitrary
command/workload. The executable command is forked and upon
its exit, statistics gathered since it was forked are <br>
displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v <br>
Increase verbosity if the binary was compiled with the DEBUG
option set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MONITOR DESCRIPTIONS <br>
Idle_Stats <br>
Shows statistics of the cpuidle kernel subsystem. Values are
retrieved from /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpuidle/state*/.
The kernel updates these values every time an idle <br>
state is entered or left. Therefore there can be some
inaccuracy when cores are in an idle state for some time
when the measure starts or ends. In worst case it can happen
that <br>
one core stayed in an idle state for the whole measure time
and the idle state usage time as exported by the kernel did
not get updated. In this case a state residency of 0
per&acirc; <br>
cent is shown while it was 100.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mperf <br>
The name comes from the aperf/mperf (average and maximum)
MSR registers used which are available on recent X86
processors. It shows the average frequency (including boost
fre&acirc; <br>
quencies). The fact that on all recent hardware the mperf
timer stops ticking in any idle state it is also used to
show C0 (processor is active) and Cx (processor is in any
<br>
sleep state) times. These counters do not have the
inaccuracy restrictions the &quot;Idle_Stats&quot; counters
may show. May work poorly on Linux-2.6.20 through 2.6.29, as
the acpi- <br>
cpufreq kernel frequency driver periodically cleared
aperf/mperf registers in those kernels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Nehalem SandyBridge
HaswellExtended <br>
Intel Core and Package sleep state counters. Threads
(hyperthreaded cores) may not be able to enter deeper core
states if its sibling is utilized. Deepest package sleep
states <br>
may in reality show up as machine/platform wide sleep states
and can only be entered if all cores are idle. Look up Intel
manuals (some are provided in the References section) <br>
for further details. The monitors are named after the CPU
family where the sleep state capabilities got introduced and
may not match exactly the CPU name of the platform. For <br>
example an IvyBridge processor has sleep state capabilities
which got introduced in Nehalem and SandyBridge processor
families. Thus on an IvyBridge processor one will get <br>
Nehalem and SandyBridge sleep state monitors.
HaswellExtended extra package sleep state capabilities are
available only in a specific Haswell (family 0x45) and
probably also <br>
other future processors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fam_12h Fam_14h <br>
AMD laptop and desktop processor (family 12h and 14h) sleep
state counters. The registers are accessed via PCI and
therefore can still be read out while cores have been <br>
offlined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is one special counter:
NBP1 (North Bridge P1). This one always returns 0 or 1,
depending on whether the North Bridge P1 power state got
entered at least once during mea&acirc; <br>
sure time. Being able to enter NBP1 state also depends on
graphics power management. Therefore this counter can be
used to verify whether the graphics&rsquo; driver power
management <br>
is working as expected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
cpupower monitor -l&quot; may show: <br>
Monitor &quot;Mperf&quot; (3 states) - Might overflow after
922000000 s</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Monitor &quot;Idle_Stats&quot;
(3 states) - Might overflow after 4294967295 s</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cpupower monitor -m
&quot;Idle_Stats,Mperf&quot; scp /tmp/test /nfs/tmp</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Monitor the scp command, show
both Mperf and Idle_Stats states counter statistics, but in
exchanged order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Be careful that the typical
command to fully utilize one CPU by doing:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cpupower monitor cat /dev/zero
&gt;/dev/null</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Does not work as expected,
because the measured output is redirected to /dev/null. This
could get workarounded by putting the line into an own, tiny
shell script. Hit CTRL-c to <br>
terminate the command and get the measure output
displayed.</p>
