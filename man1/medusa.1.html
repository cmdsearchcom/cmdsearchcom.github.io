<p>MEDUSA(1) General Commands Manual MEDUSA(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
MEDUSA - Parallel Network Login Auditor</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
medusa [-h host|-H file] [-u username|-U file] [-p
password|-P file] [-C file] -M module [OPTIONS]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Medusa is intended to be a speedy, massively parallel,
modular, login brute-forcer. The goal is to support as many
services which allow remote authentication as possible. The
<br>
author considers following items to some of the key features
of this application:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*Thread-based parallel testing.
Brute-force testing can be performed against multiple hosts,
users or passwords concurrently.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*Flexible user input. Target
information (host/user/password) can be specified in a
variety of ways. For example, each item can be either a
single entry or a file containing mul&acirc; <br>
tiple entries. Additionally, a combination file format
allows the user to refine their target listing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*Modular design. Each service
module exists as an independent .mod file. This means that
no modifications are necessary to the core application in
order to extend the supported <br>
list of services for brute-forcing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-h [TARGET] <br>
Target hostname or IP address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H [FILE] <br>
Reads target specifications from the file specified rather
than from the command line. The file should contain a list
separated by newlines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u [TARGET] <br>
Target username.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U [FILE] <br>
Reads target usernames from the file specified rather than
from the command line. The file should contain a list
separated by newlines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p [TARGET] <br>
Target password.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P [FILE] <br>
Reads target passwords from the file specified rather than
from the command line. The file should contain a list
separated by newlines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C [FILE] <br>
File containing combo entries. Combo files are colon
separated and in the following format: host:user:password.
If any of the three fields are left empty, the respective
<br>
information should be provided either as a single global
value or as a list in a file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following combinations are
possible in the combo file: 1.) foo:bar:fud 2.) foo:bar: 3.)
foo:: 4.) :bar:fud 5.) :bar: 6.) ::fud 7.) foo::fud</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Medusa also supports using
PwDump files as a combo file. The format of these files
should be user:id:lm:ntlm:::. We look for &rsquo;:::&rsquo;
at the end of the first line to deter&acirc; <br>
mine if the file contains PwDump output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O [FILE] <br>
File to append log information to. Medusa will log all
accounts credentials found to be valid or cause an unknown
error. It will also log the start and stop times of an <br>
audit, along with the calling parameters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e [n/s/ns] <br>
Additional password checks ([n] No Password, [s] Password =
Username). If both options are being used, they should be
specified together (&quot;-e ns&quot;). If only a single
option <br>
is being called use either &quot;-e n&quot; or &quot;-e
s&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M [TEXT] <br>
Name of the module to execute (without the .mod
extension).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m [TEXT] <br>
Parameter to pass to the module. This can be passed multiple
times with a different parameter each time and they will all
be sent to the module (i.e. -m Param1 -m Param2, <br>
etc.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Dump all known modules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n [NUM] <br>
Use for non-default TCP port number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Enable SSL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g [NUM] <br>
Give up after trying to connect for NUM seconds (default
3).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r [NUM] <br>
Sleep NUM seconds between retry attempts (default 3).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R [NUM] <br>
Attempt NUM retries before giving up. The total number of
attempts will be NUM + 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c [NUM] <br>
Set the number of usec that are waited during a test of the
established network socket. Some services (e.g. FTP, IMAP,
POP3, and SMTP) may be configured to drop connec&acirc; <br>
tions after an arbitrary number of failed logon attempts. We
try to reuse the established connection to send
authentication attempts until this disconnect occurs, at
which <br>
point the connection is reestablished. To accomplish this,
we check the socket to see if it&rsquo;s still alive before
authenticating within select modules. The default is
per&acirc; <br>
form a 1 usec check. It may be necessary to specify much
larger values. For example, a 1000 usec was needed against
our test vsftp server to avoid issues with its built-in <br>
anti-bruteforce mechanisms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t [NUM] <br>
Total number of logins to be tested concurrently. It should
be noted that rougly t x T threads could be running at any
one time. 381 appears to be the limit on my fairly <br>
boring Gentoo Linux host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T [NUM] <br>
Total number of hosts to be tested concurrently.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L Parallelize logins using one
username per thread. The default is to process the entire
username before proceeding.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Stop scanning host after
first valid username/password found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F Stop audit after first valid
username/password found on any host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b Suppress startup banner</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Display module&rsquo;s usage
information. This should be used in conjunction with the
&quot;-M&quot; option. For example, &quot;medusa -M smbnt
-q&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v [NUM] <br>
Verbose level [0 - 6 (more)]. All messages at or below the
specified level will be displayed. The default level is
5.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following is the breakdown
of the verbose levels: 0) EXIT APPLICATION 1) MESSAGE
WITHOUT TAG 2) LOG MESSAGE WITHOUT TAG 3) IMPORTANT MESSAGE
4) ACCOUNT FOUND <br>
5) ACCOUNT CHECK 6) GENERAL MESSAGE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w [NUM] <br>
Error debug level [0 - 10 (more)]. All messages at or below
the specified level will be displayed. The default level is
5.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following is the breakdown
of the error levels: 0) FATAL 1) ALERT 2) CRITICAL 3) ERROR
4) WARNING 5) NOTICE 6) INFO 7) DEBUG 8) DEBUG - AUDIT 9)
<br>
DEBUG - SERVER 10) DEBUG - MODULE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Display version</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Z [TEXT] <br>
Allows basic resuming of a previous scan. The supplied
parameter describes which hosts were completed, which were
partially tested and which had not been started. When <br>
Medusa receives a SIGINT, it will calculate and display a
&quot;resume map&quot;. This map can then be supplied to the
next run. For example, &quot;medusa [OPTIONS PREVIOUSLY
USED] -Z <br>
h6u1u2h8.&quot;. In this particular example, hosts 1-5 were
completed, host 6 was partially done (user 1 was partially
completed and user 2 and beyond had not been started), <br>
host 7 was completed and host 8 and beyond had not been
started. Medusa will parse this map and skip hosts and users
accordingly. It should be noted that only host and <br>
user-level, not password-level, resuming is supported. If a
user had been previously started, but was not completed, it
will be tested from the start of its respective <br>
password list.</p>
