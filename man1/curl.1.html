<p>curl(1) Curl Manual curl(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
curl - transfer a URL</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
curl [options] [URL...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
curl is a tool to transfer data from or to a server, using
one of the supported protocols (DICT, FILE, FTP, FTPS,
GOPHER, HTTP, HTTPS, IMAP, IMAPS, LDAP, LDAPS, POP3, POP3S,
<br>
RTMP, RTSP, SCP, SFTP, SMTP, SMTPS, TELNET and TFTP). The
command is designed to work without user interaction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">curl offers a busload of useful
tricks like proxy support, user authentication, FTP upload,
HTTP post, SSL connections, cookies, file transfer resume,
Metalink, and more. As you <br>
will see below, the number of features will make your head
spin!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">curl is powered by libcurl for
all transfer-related features. See libcurl(3) for
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">URL <br>
The URL syntax is protocol-dependent. You&rsquo;ll find a
detailed description in RFC 3986.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can specify multiple URLs or
parts of URLs by writing part sets within braces as in:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">http://site.{one,two,three}.com</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or you can get sequences of
alphanumeric series by using [] as in:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">ftp://ftp.numericals.com/file[1-100].txt
<br>
ftp://ftp.numericals.com/file[001-100].txt (with leading
zeros) <br>
ftp://ftp.letters.com/file[a-z].txt</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Nested sequences are not
supported, but you can use several ones next to each
other:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">http://any.org/archive[1996-1999]/vol[1-4]/part{a,b,c}.html</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can specify any amount of
URLs on the command line. They will be fetched in a
sequential manner in the specified order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can specify a step counter
for the ranges to get every Nth number or letter:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">http://www.numericals.com/file[1-100:10].txt
<br>
http://www.letters.com/file[a-z:2].txt</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you specify URL without
protocol:// prefix, curl will attempt to guess what protocol
you might want. It will then default to HTTP but try other
protocols based on often-used <br>
host name prefixes. For example, for host names starting
with &quot;ftp.&quot; curl will assume you want to speak
FTP.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">curl will do its best to use
what you pass to it as a URL. It is not trying to validate
it as a syntactically correct URL by any means but is
instead very liberal with what it <br>
accepts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">curl will attempt to re-use
connections for multiple file transfers, so that getting
many files from the same server will not do multiple
connects / handshakes. This improves <br>
speed. Of course this is only done on files specified on a
single command line and cannot be used between separate curl
invokes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROGRESS METER <br>
curl normally displays a progress meter during operations,
indicating the amount of transferred data, transfer speeds
and estimated time left, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">curl displays this data to the
terminal by default, so if you invoke curl to do an
operation and it is about to write data to the terminal, it
disables the progress meter as oth&acirc; <br>
erwise it would mess up the output mixing progress meter and
response data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want a progress meter for
HTTP POST or PUT requests, you need to redirect the response
output to a file, using shell redirect (&gt;), -o [file] or
similar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is not the same case for FTP
upload as that operation does not spit out any response data
to the terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you prefer a progress
&quot;bar&quot; instead of the regular meter, -# is your
friend.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
In general, all boolean options are enabled with --option
and yet again disabled with --no-option. That is, you use
the exact same option name but prefix it with
&quot;no-&quot;. However, <br>
in this list we mostly only list and show the --option
version of them. (This concept with --no options was added
in 7.19.0. Previously most options were toggled on/off on
<br>
repeated use of the same command line option.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-#, --progress-bar <br>
Make curl display progress as a simple progress bar instead
of the standard, more informational, meter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-0, --http1.0 <br>
(HTTP) Forces curl to issue its requests using HTTP 1.0
instead of using its internally preferred: HTTP 1.1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-1, --tlsv1 <br>
(SSL) Forces curl to use TLS version 1.x when negotiating
with a remote TLS server. You can use options --tlsv1.0,
--tlsv1.1, and --tlsv1.2 to control the TLS version <br>
more precisely (if the SSL backend in use supports such a
level of control).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-2, --sslv2 <br>
(SSL) Forces curl to use SSL version 2 when negotiating with
a remote SSL server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-3, --sslv3 <br>
(SSL) Forces curl to use SSL version 3 when negotiating with
a remote SSL server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-4, --ipv4 <br>
If curl is capable of resolving an address to multiple IP
versions (which it is if it is IPv6-capable), this option
tells curl to resolve names to IPv4 addresses only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-6, --ipv6 <br>
If curl is capable of resolving an address to multiple IP
versions (which it is if it is IPv6-capable), this option
tells curl to resolve names to IPv6 addresses only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a, --append <br>
(FTP/SFTP) When used in an upload, this will tell curl to
append to the target file instead of overwriting it. If the
file doesn&rsquo;t exist, it will be created. Note that <br>
this flag is ignored by some SSH servers (including
OpenSSH).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A, --user-agent &lt;agent
string&gt; <br>
(HTTP) Specify the User-Agent string to send to the HTTP
server. Some badly done CGIs fail if this field isn&rsquo;t
set to &quot;Mozilla/4.0&quot;. To encode blanks in the
string, sur&acirc; <br>
round the string with single quote marks. This can also be
set with the -H, --header option of course.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option is used several
times, the last one will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--anyauth <br>
(HTTP) Tells curl to figure out authentication method by
itself, and use the most secure one the remote site claims
to support. This is done by first doing a request and <br>
checking the response-headers, thus possibly inducing an
extra network round-trip. This is used instead of setting a
specific authentication method, which you can do with <br>
--basic, --digest, --ntlm, and --negotiate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that using --anyauth is not
recommended if you do uploads from stdin, since it may
require data to be sent twice and then the client must be
able to rewind. If the <br>
need should arise when uploading from stdin, the upload
operation will fail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b, --cookie &lt;name=data&gt;
<br>
(HTTP) Pass the data to the HTTP server as a cookie. It is
supposedly the data previously received from the server in a
&quot;Set-Cookie:&quot; line. The data should be in the
for&acirc; <br>
mat &quot;NAME1=VALUE1; NAME2=VALUE2&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no &rsquo;=&rsquo; symbol is
used in the line, it is treated as a filename to use to read
previously stored cookie lines from, which should be used in
this session if they match. <br>
Using this method also activates the &quot;cookie
parser&quot; which will make curl record incoming cookies
too, which may be handy if you&rsquo;re using this in
combination with the -L, <br>
--location option. The file format of the file to read
cookies from should be plain HTTP headers or the
Netscape/Mozilla cookie file format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE that the file specified
with -b, --cookie is only used as input. No cookies will be
stored in the file. To store cookies, use the -c,
--cookie-jar option or you could <br>
even save the HTTP headers to a file using -D,
--dump-header!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option is used several
times, the last one will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B, --use-ascii <br>
(FTP/LDAP) Enable ASCII transfer. For FTP, this can also be
enforced by using an URL that ends with &quot;;type=A&quot;.
This option causes data sent to stdout to be in text mode
<br>
for win32 systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--basic <br>
(HTTP) Tells curl to use HTTP Basic authentication. This is
the default and this option is usually pointless, unless you
use it to override a previously set option that <br>
sets a different authentication method (such as --ntlm,
--digest, or --negotiate).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --cookie-jar &lt;file
name&gt; <br>
(HTTP) Specify to which file you want curl to write all
cookies after a completed operation. Curl writes all cookies
previously read from a specified file as well as all <br>
cookies received from remote server(s). If no cookies are
known, no file will be written. The file will be written
using the Netscape cookie file format. If you set the <br>
file name to a single dash, &quot;-&quot;, the cookies will
be written to stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command line option will
activate the cookie engine that makes curl record and use
cookies. Another way to activate it is to use the -b,
--cookie option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the cookie jar can&rsquo;t be
created or written to, the whole curl operation won&rsquo;t
fail or even report an error clearly. Using -v will get a
warning displayed, but that is <br>
the only visible feedback you get about this possibly lethal
situation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option is used several
times, the last specified file name will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C, --continue-at &lt;offset&gt;
<br>
Continue/Resume a previous file transfer at the given
offset. The given offset is the exact number of bytes that
will be skipped, counting from the beginning of the source
<br>
file before it is transferred to the destination. If used
with uploads, the FTP server command SIZE will not be used
by curl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use &quot;-C -&quot; to tell
curl to automatically find out where/how to resume the
transfer. It then uses the given output/input files to
figure that out.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option is used several
times, the last one will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ciphers &lt;list of
ciphers&gt; <br>
(SSL) Specifies which ciphers to use in the connection. The
list of ciphers must specify valid ciphers. Read up on SSL
cipher list details on this URL: <br>
http://www.openssl.org/docs/apps/ciphers.html</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NSS ciphers are done differently
than OpenSSL and GnuTLS. The full list of NSS ciphers is in
the NSSCipherSuite entry at this URL:
http://git.fedora&acirc; <br>

hosted.org/cgit/mod_nss.git/plain/docs/mod_nss.html#Directives</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option is used several
times, the last one will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--compressed <br>
(HTTP) Request a compressed response using one of the
algorithms curl supports, and save the uncompressed
document. If this option is used and the server sends an
unsup&acirc; <br>
ported encoding, curl will report an error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--connect-timeout
&lt;seconds&gt; <br>
Maximum time in seconds that you allow the connection to the
server to take. This only limits the connection phase, once
curl has connected this option is of no more use. <br>
See also the -m, --max-time option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option is used several
times, the last one will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--create-dirs <br>
When used in conjunction with the -o option, curl will
create the necessary local directory hierarchy as needed.
This option creates the dirs mentioned with the -o option,
<br>
nothing else. If the -o file name uses no dir or if the dirs
it mentions already exist, no dir will be created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To create remote directories
when using FTP or SFTP, try --ftp-create-dirs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--crlf (FTP) Convert LF to CRLF
in upload. Useful for MVS (OS/390).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--crlfile &lt;file&gt; <br>
(HTTPS/FTPS) Provide a file using PEM format with a
Certificate Revocation List that may specify peer
certificates that are to be considered revoked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option is used several
times, the last one will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(Added in 7.19.7)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --data &lt;data&gt; <br>
(HTTP) Sends the specified data in a POST request to the
HTTP server, in the same way that a browser does when a user
has filled in an HTML form and presses the submit <br>
button. This will cause curl to pass the data to the server
using the content-type application/x-www-form-urlencoded.
Compare to -F, --form.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --data is the same as
--data-ascii. To post data purely binary, you should instead
use the --data-binary option. To URL-encode the value of a
form field you may use <br>
--data-urlencode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If any of these options is used
more than once on the same command line, the data pieces
specified will be merged together with a separating
&amp;-symbol. Thus, using &rsquo;-d <br>
name=daniel -d skill=lousy&rsquo; would generate a post
chunk that looks like
&rsquo;name=daniel&amp;skill=lousy&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you start the data with the
letter @, the rest should be a file name to read the data
from, or - if you want curl to read the data from stdin. The
contents of the file <br>
must already be URL-encoded. Multiple files can also be
specified. Posting data from a file named
&rsquo;foobar&rsquo; would thus be done with --data
@foobar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D, --dump-header &lt;file&gt;
<br>
Write the protocol headers to the specified file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is handy to use when
you want to store the headers that an HTTP site sends to
you. Cookies from the headers could then be read in a second
curl invocation by <br>
using the -b, --cookie option! The -c, --cookie-jar option
is however a better way to store cookies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When used in FTP, the FTP server
response lines are considered being &quot;headers&quot; and
thus are saved there.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option is used several
times, the last one will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--data-ascii &lt;data&gt; <br>
See -d, --data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--data-binary &lt;data&gt; <br>
(HTTP) This posts data exactly as specified with no extra
processing whatsoever.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you start the data with the
letter @, the rest should be a filename. Data is posted in a
similar manner as --data-ascii does, except that newlines
are preserved and <br>
conversions are never done.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option is used several
times, the ones following the first will append data as
described in -d, --data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--data-urlencode &lt;data&gt;
<br>
(HTTP) This posts data, similar to the other --data options
with the exception that this performs URL-encoding. (Added
in 7.18.0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To be CGI-compliant, the
&lt;data&gt; part should begin with a name followed by a
separator and a content specification. The &lt;data&gt; part
can be passed to curl using one of the <br>
following syntaxes:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">content <br>
This will make curl URL-encode the content and pass that on.
Just be careful so that the content doesn&rsquo;t contain
any = or @ symbols, as that will then make the syn&acirc;
<br>
tax match one of the other cases below!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">=content <br>
This will make curl URL-encode the content and pass that on.
The preceding = symbol is not included in the data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">name=content <br>
This will make curl URL-encode the content part and pass
that on. Note that the name part is expected to be
URL-encoded already.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@filename <br>
This will make curl load data from the given file (including
any newlines), URL-encode that data and pass it on in the
POST.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">name@filename <br>
This will make curl load data from the given file (including
any newlines), URL-encode that data and pass it on in the
POST. The name part gets an equal sign <br>
appended, resulting in name=urlencoded-file-content. Note
that the name is expected to be URL-encoded already.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--delegation LEVEL <br>
Set LEVEL to tell the server what it is allowed to delegate
when it comes to user credentials. Used with
GSS/kerberos.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">none Don&rsquo;t allow any
delegation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">policy Delegates if and only if
the OK-AS-DELEGATE flag is set in the Kerberos service
ticket, which is a matter of realm policy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">always Unconditionally allow the
server to delegate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--digest <br>
(HTTP) Enables HTTP Digest authentication. This is an
authentication scheme that prevents the password from being
sent over the wire in clear text. Use this in combination
<br>
with the normal -u, --user option to set user name and
password. See also --ntlm, --negotiate and --anyauth for
related options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option is used several
times, only the first one is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--disable-eprt <br>
(FTP) Tell curl to disable the use of the EPRT and LPRT
commands when doing active FTP transfers. Curl will normally
always first attempt to use EPRT, then LPRT before <br>
using PORT, but with this option, it will use PORT right
away. EPRT and LPRT are extensions to the original FTP
protocol, and may not work on all servers, but they enable
<br>
more functionality in a better way than the traditional PORT
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--eprt can be used to explicitly
enable EPRT again and --no-eprt is an alias for
--disable-eprt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the server is an IPv6 host,
this option will have no effect as EPRT is necessary
then.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Disabling EPRT only changes the
active behavior. If you want to switch to passive mode you
need to not use -P, --ftp-port or force it with
--ftp-pasv.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--disable-epsv <br>
(FTP) Tell curl to disable the use of the EPSV command when
doing passive FTP transfers. Curl will normally always first
attempt to use EPSV before PASV, but with this <br>
option, it will not try using EPSV.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--epsv can be used to explicitly
enable EPSV again and --no-epsv is an alias for
--disable-epsv.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the server is an IPv6 host,
this option will have no effect as EPSV is necessary
then.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Disabling EPSV only changes the
passive behavior. If you want to switch to active mode you
need to use -P, --ftp-port.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e, --referer &lt;URL&gt; <br>
(HTTP) Sends the &quot;Referer Page&quot; information to the
HTTP server. This can also be set with the -H, --header flag
of course. When used with -L, --location you can append <br>
&quot;;auto&quot; to the --referer URL to make curl
automatically set the previous URL when it follows a
Location: header. The &quot;;auto&quot; string can be used
alone, even if you don&rsquo;t <br>
set an initial --referer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option is used several
times, the last one will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E, --cert
&lt;certificate[:password]&gt; <br>
(SSL) Tells curl to use the specified client certificate
file when getting a file with HTTPS, FTPS or another
SSL-based protocol. The certificate must be in PEM format.
<br>
If the optional password isn&rsquo;t specified, it will be
queried for on the terminal. Note that this option assumes a
&quot;certificate&quot; file that is the private key and the
pri&acirc; <br>
vate certificate concatenated! See --cert and --key to
specify them independently.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If curl is built against the NSS
SSL library then this option can tell curl the nickname of
the certificate to use within the NSS database defined by
the environment vari&acirc; <br>
able SSL_DIR (or by default /etc/pki/nssdb). If the NSS PEM
PKCS#11 module (libnsspem.so) is available then PEM files
may be loaded. If you want to use a file from the <br>
current directory, please precede it with &quot;./&quot;
prefix, in order to avoid confusion with a nickname.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option is used several
times, the last one will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--engine &lt;name&gt; <br>
Select the OpenSSL crypto engine to use for cipher
operations. Use --engine list to print a list of build-time
supported engines. Note that not all (or none) of the <br>
engines may be available at run-time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--environment <br>
(RISC OS ONLY) Sets a range of environment variables, using
the names the -w option supports, to allow easier extraction
of useful information after having run curl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--egd-file &lt;file&gt; <br>
(SSL) Specify the path name to the Entropy Gathering Daemon
socket. The socket is used to seed the random engine for SSL
connections. See also the --random-file option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--cert-type &lt;type&gt; <br>
(SSL) Tells curl what certificate type the provided
certificate is in. PEM, DER and ENG are recognized types. If
not specified, PEM is assumed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option is used several
times, the last one will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--cacert &lt;CA certificate&gt;
<br>
(SSL) Tells curl to use the specified certificate file to
verify the peer. The file may contain multiple CA
certificates. The certificate(s) must be in PEM format.
Nor&acirc; <br>
mally curl is built to use a default file for this, so this
option is typically used to alter that default file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">curl recognizes the environment
variable named &rsquo;CURL_CA_BUNDLE&rsquo; if it is set,
and uses the given path as a path to a CA cert bundle. This
option overrides that variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The windows version of curl will
automatically look for a CA certs file named
&Acirc;&acute;curl-ca-bundle.crt&Acirc;&acute;, either in
the same directory as curl.exe, or in the Current Working
<br>
Directory, or in any folder along your PATH.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If curl is built against the NSS
SSL library, the NSS PEM PKCS#11 module (libnsspem.so) needs
to be available for this option to work properly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option is used several
times, the last one will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--capath &lt;CA certificate
directory&gt; <br>
(SSL) Tells curl to use the specified certificate directory
to verify the peer. Multiple paths can be provided by
separating them with &quot;:&quot; (e.g.
&quot;path1:path2:path3&quot;). The <br>
certificates must be in PEM format, and if curl is built
against OpenSSL, the directory must have been processed
using the c_rehash utility supplied with OpenSSL. Using <br>
--capath can allow OpenSSL-powered curl to make
SSL-connections much more efficiently than using --cacert if
the --cacert file contains many CA certificates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option is set, the
default capath value will be ignored, and if it is used
several times, the last one will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, --fail <br>
(HTTP) Fail silently (no output at all) on server errors.
This is mostly done to better enable scripts etc to better
deal with failed attempts. In normal cases when an <br>
HTTP server fails to deliver a document, it returns an HTML
document stating so (which often also describes why and
more). This flag will prevent curl from outputting that <br>
and return error 22.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This method is not fail-safe and
there are occasions where non-successful response codes will
slip through, especially when authentication is involved
(response codes 401 <br>
and 407).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F, --form &lt;name=content&gt;
<br>
(HTTP) This lets curl emulate a filled-in form in which a
user has pressed the submit button. This causes curl to POST
data using the Content-Type multipart/form-data <br>
according to RFC 2388. This enables uploading of binary
files etc. To force the &rsquo;content&rsquo; part to be a
file, prefix the file name with an @ sign. To just get the
content <br>
part from a file, prefix the file name with the symbol &lt;.
The difference between @ and &lt; is then that @ makes a
file get attached in the post as a file upload, while the
&lt; <br>
makes a text field and just get the contents for that text
field from a file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example, to send your password
file to the server, where &rsquo;password&rsquo; is the name
of the form-field to which /etc/passwd will be the
input:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">curl -F password=@/etc/passwd
www.mypasswords.com</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To read content from stdin
instead of a file, use - as the filename. This goes for both
@ and &lt; constructs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also tell curl what
Content-Type to use by using &rsquo;type=&rsquo;, in a
manner similar to:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">curl -F
&quot;web=@index.html;type=text/html&quot; url.com</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">curl -F
&quot;name=daniel;type=text/foo&quot; url.com</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also explicitly change
the name field of a file upload part by setting filename=,
like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">curl -F
&quot;file=@localfile;filename=nameinpost&quot; url.com</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If filename/path contains
&rsquo;,&rsquo; or &rsquo;;&rsquo;, it must be quoted by
double-quotes like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">curl -F &quot;file=@</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">curl -F
&rsquo;file=@&quot;localfile&quot;;filename=&quot;nameinpost&quot;&rsquo;
url.com</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that if a filename/path is
quoted by double-quotes, any double-quote or backslash
within the filename must be escaped by backslash.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See further examples and details
in the MANUAL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option can be used multiple
times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ftp-account [data] <br>
(FTP) When an FTP server asks for &quot;account data&quot;
after user name and password has been provided, this data is
sent off using the ACCT command. (Added in 7.13.0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option is used several
times, the last one will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ftp-alternative-to-user
&lt;command&gt; <br>
(FTP) If authenticating with the USER and PASS commands
fails, send this command. When connecting to
Tumbleweed&rsquo;s Secure Transport server over FTPS using a
client cer&acirc; <br>
tificate, using &quot;SITE AUTH&quot; will tell the server
to retrieve the username from the certificate. (Added in
7.15.5)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ftp-create-dirs <br>
(FTP/SFTP) When an FTP or SFTP URL/operation uses a path
that doesn&rsquo;t currently exist on the server, the
standard behavior of curl is to fail. Using this option,
curl will <br>
instead attempt to create missing directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ftp-method [method] <br>
(FTP) Control what method curl should use to reach a file on
an FTP(S) server. The method argument should be one of the
following alternatives:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">multicwd <br>
curl does a single CWD operation for each path part in the
given URL. For deep hierarchies this means very many
commands. This is how RFC 1738 says it should be <br>
done. This is the default but the slowest behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nocwd curl does no CWD at all.
curl will do SIZE, RETR, STOR etc and give a full path to
the server for all these commands. This is the fastest
behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">singlecwd <br>
curl does one CWD with the full target directory and then
operates on the file &quot;normally&quot; (like in the
multicwd case). This is somewhat more standards compliant
<br>
than &rsquo;nocwd&rsquo; but without the full penalty of
&rsquo;multicwd&rsquo;. <br>
(Added in 7.15.1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ftp-pasv <br>
(FTP) Use passive mode for the data connection. Passive is
the internal default behavior, but using this option can be
used to override a previous -P/-ftp-port option. <br>
(Added in 7.11.0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option is used several
times, only the first one is used. Undoing an enforced
passive really isn&rsquo;t doable but you must then instead
enforce the correct -P, --ftp- <br>
port again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Passive mode means that curl
will try the EPSV command first and then PASV, unless
--disable-epsv is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ftp-skip-pasv-ip <br>
(FTP) Tell curl to not use the IP address the server
suggests in its response to curl&rsquo;s PASV command when
curl connects the data connection. Instead curl will re-use
the <br>
same IP address it already uses for the control connection.
(Added in 7.14.2)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option has no effect if
PORT, EPRT or EPSV is used instead of PASV.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ftp-pret <br>
(FTP) Tell curl to send a PRET command before PASV (and
EPSV). Certain FTP servers, mainly drftpd, require this
non-standard command for directory listings as well as up
<br>
and downloads in PASV mode. (Added in 7.20.x)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ftp-ssl-ccc <br>
(FTP) Use CCC (Clear Command Channel) Shuts down the SSL/TLS
layer after authenticating. The rest of the control channel
communication will be unencrypted. This allows NAT <br>
routers to follow the FTP transaction. The default mode is
passive. See --ftp-ssl-ccc-mode for other modes. (Added in
7.16.1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ftp-ssl-ccc-mode
[active/passive] <br>
(FTP) Use CCC (Clear Command Channel) Sets the CCC mode. The
passive mode will not initiate the shutdown, but instead
wait for the server to do it, and will not reply to <br>
the shutdown from the server. The active mode initiates the
shutdown and waits for a reply from the server. (Added in
7.16.2)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ftp-ssl-control <br>
(FTP) Require SSL/TLS for the FTP login, clear for transfer.
Allows secure authentication, but non-encrypted data
transfers for efficiency. Fails the transfer if the <br>
server doesn&rsquo;t support SSL/TLS. (Added in 7.16.0) that
can still be used but will be removed in a future
version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--form-string
&lt;name=string&gt; <br>
(HTTP) Similar to --form except that the value string for
the named parameter is used literally. Leading
&rsquo;@&rsquo; and &rsquo;&lt;&rsquo; characters, and the
&rsquo;;type=&rsquo; string in the value have <br>
no special meaning. Use this in preference to --form if
there&rsquo;s any possibility that the string value may
accidentally trigger the &rsquo;@&rsquo; or
&rsquo;&lt;&rsquo; features of --form.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g, --globoff <br>
This option switches off the &quot;URL globbing
parser&quot;. When you set this option, you can specify URLs
that contain the letters {}[] without having them being
interpreted by <br>
curl itself. Note that these letters are not normal legal
URL contents but they should be encoded according to the URI
standard.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-G, --get <br>
When used, this option will make all data specified with -d,
--data or --data-binary to be used in an HTTP GET request
instead of the POST request that otherwise would be <br>
used. The data will be appended to the URL with a
&rsquo;?&rsquo; separator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If used in combination with -I,
the POST data will instead be appended to the URL with a
HEAD request.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option is used several
times, only the first one is used. This is because undoing a
GET doesn&rsquo;t make sense, but you should then instead
enforce the alternative <br>
method you prefer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H, --header &lt;header&gt; <br>
(HTTP) Extra header to use when getting a web page. You may
specify any number of extra headers. Note that if you should
add a custom header that has the same name as one <br>
of the internal ones curl would use, your externally set
header will be used instead of the internal one. This allows
you to make even trickier stuff than curl would nor&acirc;
<br>
mally do. You should not replace internally set headers
without knowing perfectly well what you&rsquo;re doing.
Remove an internal header by giving a replacement without
content <br>
on the right side of the colon, as in: -H &quot;Host:&quot;.
If you send the custom header with no-value then its header
must be terminated with a semicolon, such as -H
&quot;X-Custom- <br>
Header;&quot; to send &quot;X-Custom-Header:&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">curl will make sure that each
header you add/replace is sent with the proper end-of-line
marker, you should thus not add that as a part of the header
content: do not add <br>
newlines or carriage returns, they will only mess things up
for you.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See also the -A, --user-agent
and -e, --referer options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option can be used multiple
times to add/replace/remove multiple headers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--hostpubmd5 &lt;md5&gt; <br>
(SCP/SFTP) Pass a string containing 32 hexadecimal digits.
The string should be the 128 bit MD5 checksum of the remote
host&rsquo;s public key, curl will refuse the connection
<br>
with the host unless the md5sums match. (Added in
7.17.1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ignore-content-length <br>
(HTTP) Ignore the Content-Length header. This is
particularly useful for servers running Apache 1.x, which
will report incorrect Content-Length for files larger than 2
<br>
gigabytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i, --include <br>
(HTTP) Include the HTTP-header in the output. The
HTTP-header includes things like server-name, date of the
document, HTTP-version and more...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I, --head <br>
(HTTP/FTP/FILE) Fetch the HTTP-header only! HTTP-servers
feature the command HEAD which this uses to get nothing but
the header of a document. When used on an FTP or FILE <br>
file, curl displays the file size and last modification time
only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--interface &lt;name&gt; <br>
Perform an operation using a specified interface. You can
enter interface name, IP address or host name. An example
could look like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">curl --interface eth0:1
http://www.netscape.com/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option is used several
times, the last one will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-j, --junk-session-cookies <br>
(HTTP) When curl is told to read cookies from a given file,
this option will make it discard all &quot;session
cookies&quot;. This will basically have the same effect as
if a new <br>
session is started. Typical browsers always discard session
cookies when they&rsquo;re closed down.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-J, --remote-header-name <br>
(HTTP) This option tells the -O, --remote-name option to use
the server-specified Content-Disposition filename instead of
extracting a filename from the URL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k, --insecure <br>
(SSL) This option explicitly allows curl to perform
&quot;insecure&quot; SSL connections and transfers. All SSL
connections are attempted to be made secure by using the CA
certifi&acirc; <br>
cate bundle installed by default. This makes all connections
considered &quot;insecure&quot; fail unless -k, --insecure
is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See this online resource for
further details: http://curl.haxx.se/docs/sslcerts.html</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-K, --config &lt;config file&gt;
<br>
Specify which config file to read curl arguments from. The
config file is a text file in which command line arguments
can be written which then will be used as if they <br>
were written on the actual command line. Options and their
parameters must be specified on the same config file line,
separated by whitespace, colon, the equals sign or <br>
any combination thereof (however, the preferred separator is
the equals sign). If the parameter is to contain whitespace,
the parameter must be enclosed within quotes. <br>
Within double quotes, the following escape sequences are
available: \, <br>
config line is a &rsquo;#&rsquo; character, the rest of the
line will be treated as a comment. Only write one option per
physical line in the config file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specify the filename to -K,
--config as &rsquo;-&rsquo; to make curl read the file from
stdin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that to be able to specify
a URL in the config file, you need to specify it using the
--url option, and not by simply writing the URL on its own
line. So, it could <br>
look similar to this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">url =
&quot;http://curl.haxx.se/docs/&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Long option names can optionally
be given in the config file without the initial double
dashes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When curl is invoked, it always
(unless -q is used) checks for a default config file and
uses it if found. The default config file is checked for in
the following places <br>
in this order:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1) curl tries to find the
&quot;home dir&quot;: It first checks for the CURL_HOME and
then the HOME environment variables. Failing that, it uses
getpwuid() on UNIX-like systems <br>
(which returns the home dir given the current user in your
system). On Windows, it then checks for the APPDATA
variable, or as a last resort the
&rsquo;%USERPROFILE%0lication <br>
Data&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2) On windows, if there is no
_curlrc file in the home dir, it checks for one in the same
dir the curl executable is placed. On UNIX-like systems, it
will simply try to <br>
load .curlrc from the determined home dir.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># --- Example file --- <br>
# this is a comment <br>
url = &quot;curl.haxx.se&quot; <br>
output = &quot;curlhere.html&quot; <br>
user-agent = &quot;superagent/1.0&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># and fetch another URL too <br>
url = &quot;curl.haxx.se/docs/manpage.html&quot; <br>
-O <br>
referer = &quot;http://nowhereatall.com/&quot; <br>
# --- End of example file ---</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option can be used multiple
times to load multiple config files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--keepalive-time &lt;seconds&gt;
<br>
This option sets the time a connection needs to remain idle
before sending keepalive probes and the time between
individual keepalive probes. It is currently effective on
<br>
operating systems offering the TCP_KEEPIDLE and
TCP_KEEPINTVL socket options (meaning Linux, recent AIX,
HP-UX and more). This option has no effect if --no-keepalive
is <br>
used. (Added in 7.18.0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option is used several
times, the last one will be used. If unspecified, the option
defaults to 60 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--key &lt;key&gt; <br>
(SSL/SSH) Private key file name. Allows you to provide your
private key in this separate file. For SSH, if not
specified, curl tries the following candidates in order:
<br>
&rsquo;~/.ssh/id_rsa&rsquo;, &rsquo;~/.ssh/id_dsa&rsquo;,
&rsquo;./id_rsa&rsquo;, &rsquo;./id_dsa&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option is used several
times, the last one will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--key-type &lt;type&gt; <br>
(SSL) Private key file type. Specify which type your --key
provided private key is. DER, PEM, and ENG are supported. If
not specified, PEM is assumed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option is used several
times, the last one will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--krb &lt;level&gt; <br>
(FTP) Enable Kerberos authentication and use. The level must
be entered and should be one of &rsquo;clear&rsquo;,
&rsquo;safe&rsquo;, &rsquo;confidential&rsquo;, or
&rsquo;private&rsquo;. Should you use a level that is <br>
not one of these, &rsquo;private&rsquo; will instead be
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option requires a library
built with kerberos4 or GSSAPI (GSS-Negotiate) support. This
is not very common. Use -V, --version to see if your curl
supports it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option is used several
times, the last one will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, --list-only <br>
(FTP) When listing an FTP directory, this switch forces a
name-only view. Especially useful if you want to
machine-parse the contents of an FTP directory since the
normal <br>
directory view doesn&rsquo;t use a standard look or
format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option causes an FTP NLST
command to be sent. Some FTP servers list only files in
their response to NLST; they do not include subdirectories
and symbolic links.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L, --location <br>
(HTTP/HTTPS) If the server reports that the requested page
has moved to a different location (indicated with a
Location: header and a 3XX response code), this option will
<br>
make curl redo the request on the new place. If used
together with -i, --include or -I, --head, headers from all
requested pages will be shown. When authentication is <br>
used, curl only sends its credentials to the initial host.
If a redirect takes curl to a different host, it won&rsquo;t
be able to intercept the user+password. See also
--loca&acirc; <br>
tion-trusted on how to change this. You can limit the amount
of redirects to follow by using the --max-redirs option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When curl follows a redirect and
the request is not a plain GET (for example POST or PUT), it
will do the following request with a GET if the HTTP
response was 301, 302, <br>
or 303. If the response code was any other 3xx code, curl
will re-send the following request using the same unmodified
method.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--libcurl &lt;file&gt; <br>
Append this option to any ordinary curl command line, and
you will get a libcurl-using C source code written to the
file that does the equivalent of what your command-line <br>
operation does!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option is used several
times, the last given file name will be used. (Added in
7.16.1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--limit-rate &lt;speed&gt; <br>
Specify the maximum transfer rate you want curl to use. This
feature is useful if you have a limited pipe and you&rsquo;d
like your transfer not to use your entire bandwidth.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The given speed is measured in
bytes/second, unless a suffix is appended. Appending
&rsquo;k&rsquo; or &rsquo;K&rsquo; will count the number as
kilobytes, &rsquo;m&rsquo; or M&rsquo; makes it megabytes,
while &rsquo;g&rsquo; <br>
or &rsquo;G&rsquo; makes it gigabytes. Examples: 200K, 3m
and 1G.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The given rate is the average
speed counted during the entire transfer. It means that curl
might use higher transfer speeds in short bursts, but over
time it uses no more <br>
than the given rate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you also use the -Y,
--speed-limit option, that option will take precedence and
might cripple the rate-limiting slightly, to help keeping
the speed-limit logic working.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option is used several
times, the last one will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--local-port &lt;num&gt;[-num]
<br>
Set a preferred number or range of local port numbers to use
for the connection(s). Note that port numbers by nature are
a scarce resource that will be busy at times so <br>
setting this range to something too narrow might cause
unnecessary connection setup failures. (Added in 7.15.2)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--location-trusted <br>
(HTTP/HTTPS) Like -L, --location, but will allow sending the
name + password to all hosts that the site may redirect to.
This may or may not introduce a security breach if <br>
the site redirects you to a site to which you&rsquo;ll send
your authentication info (which is plaintext in the case of
HTTP Basic authentication).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m, --max-time &lt;seconds&gt;
<br>
Maximum time in seconds that you allow the whole operation
to take. This is useful for preventing your batch jobs from
hanging for hours due to slow networks or links <br>
going down. See also the --connect-timeout option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option is used several
times, the last one will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--mail-auth &lt;address&gt; <br>
(SMTP) Specify a single address. This will be used to
specify the authentication address (identity) of a submitted
message that is being relayed to another server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(Added in 7.25.0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--mail-from &lt;address&gt; <br>
(SMTP) Specify a single address that the given mail should
get sent from.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(Added in 7.20.0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--max-filesize &lt;bytes&gt;
<br>
Specify the maximum size (in bytes) of a file to download.
If the file requested is larger than this value, the
transfer will not start and curl will return with exit code
<br>
63.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: The file size is not
always known prior to download, and for such files this
option has no effect even if the file transfer ends up being
larger than this given <br>
limit. This concerns both FTP and HTTP transfers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--mail-rcpt &lt;address&gt; <br>
(SMTP) Specify a single address that the given mail should
get sent to. This option can be used multiple times to
specify many recipients.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(Added in 7.20.0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--max-redirs &lt;num&gt; <br>
Set maximum number of redirection-followings allowed. If -L,
--location is used, this option can be used to prevent curl
from following redirections &quot;in absurdum&quot;. By <br>
default, the limit is set to 50 redirections. Set this
option to -1 to make it limitless.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option is used several
times, the last one will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--metalink <br>
This option can tell curl to parse and process a given URI
as Metalink file (both version 3 and 4 (RFC 5854) are
supported) and make use of the mirrors listed within for
<br>
failover if there are errors (such as the file or server not
being available). It will also verify the hash of the file
after the download completes. The Metalink file <br>
itself is downloaded and processed in memory and not stored
in the local file system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example to use a remote Metalink
file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">curl --metalink
http://www.example.com/example.metalink</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To use a Metalink file in the
local file system, use FILE protocol (file://):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">curl --metalink
file://example.metalink</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please note that if FILE
protocol is disabled, there is no way to use a local
Metalink file at the time of this writing. Also note that if
--metalink and --include are <br>
used together, --include will be ignored. This is because
including headers in the response will break Metalink parser
and if the headers are included in the file <br>
described in Metalink file, hash check will fail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(Added in 7.27.0, if built
against the libmetalink library.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --netrc <br>
Makes curl scan the .netrc (_netrc on Windows) file in the
user&rsquo;s home directory for login name and password.
This is typically used for FTP on UNIX. If used with HTTP,
<br>
curl will enable user authentication. See netrc(4) or ftp(1)
for details on the file format. Curl will not complain if
that file doesn&rsquo;t have the right permissions (it <br>
should not be either world- or group-readable). The
environment variable &quot;HOME&quot; is used to find the
home directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A quick and very simple example
of how to setup a .netrc to allow curl to FTP to the machine
host.domain.com with user name &rsquo;myself&rsquo; and
password &rsquo;secret&rsquo; should look sim&acirc; <br>
ilar to:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">machine host.domain.com login
myself password secret</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N, --no-buffer <br>
Disables the buffering of the output stream. In normal work
situations, curl will use a standard buffered output stream
that will have the effect that it will output the <br>
data in chunks, not necessarily exactly when the data
arrives. Using this option will disable that buffering.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that this is the negated
option name documented. You can thus use --buffer to enforce
the buffering.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--netrc-file <br>
This option is similar to --netrc, except that you provide
the path (absolute or relative) to the netrc file that Curl
should use. You can only specify one netrc file per <br>
invocation. If several --netrc-file options are provided,
only the last one will be used. (Added in 7.21.5)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option overrides any use of
--netrc as they are mutually exclusive. It will also abide
by --netrc-optional if specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--netrc-optional <br>
Very similar to --netrc, but this option makes the .netrc
usage optional and not mandatory as the --netrc option
does.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--negotiate <br>
(HTTP) Enables GSS-Negotiate authentication. The
GSS-Negotiate method was designed by Microsoft and is used
in their web applications. It is primarily meant as a
support <br>
for Kerberos5 authentication but may be also used along with
another authentication method. For more information see IETF
draft draft-brezak-spnego-http-04.txt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to enable Negotiate
for your proxy authentication, then use
--proxy-negotiate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option requires a library
built with GSSAPI support. This is not very common. Use -V,
--version to see if your version supports GSS-Negotiate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When using this option, you must
also provide a fake -u, --user option to activate the
authentication code properly. Sending a &rsquo;-u :&rsquo;
is enough as the user name and pass&acirc; <br>
word from the -u option aren&rsquo;t actually used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option is used several
times, only the first one is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-keepalive <br>
Disables the use of keepalive messages on the TCP
connection, as by default curl enables them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that this is the negated
option name documented. You can thus use --keepalive to
enforce keepalive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-sessionid <br>
(SSL) Disable curl&rsquo;s use of SSL session-ID caching. By
default all transfers are done using the cache. Note that
while nothing should ever get hurt by attempting to reuse
<br>
SSL session-IDs, there seem to be broken SSL implementations
in the wild that may require you to disable this in order
for you to succeed. (Added in 7.16.0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that this is the negated
option name documented. You can thus use --sessionid to
enforce session-ID caching.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--noproxy &lt;no-proxy-list&gt;
<br>
Comma-separated list of hosts which do not use a proxy, if
one is specified. The only wildcard is a single * character,
which matches all hosts, and effectively disables <br>
the proxy. Each name in this list is matched as either a
domain which contains the hostname, or the hostname itself.
For example, local.com would match local.com, <br>
local.com:80, and www.local.com, but not www.notlocal.com.
(Added in 7.19.4).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ntlm (HTTP) Enables NTLM
authentication. The NTLM authentication method was designed
by Microsoft and is used by IIS web servers. It is a
proprietary protocol, reverse-engi&acirc; <br>
neered by clever people and implemented in curl based on
their efforts. This kind of behavior should not be endorsed,
you should encourage everyone who uses NTLM to switch <br>
to a public and documented authentication method instead,
such as Digest.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to enable NTLM for
your proxy authentication, then use --proxy-ntlm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option requires a library
built with SSL support. Use -V, --version to see if your
curl supports NTLM.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option is used several
times, only the first one is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o, --output &lt;file&gt; <br>
Write output to &lt;file&gt; instead of stdout. If you are
using {} or [] to fetch multiple documents, you can use
&rsquo;#&rsquo; followed by a number in the &lt;file&gt;
specifier. That vari&acirc; <br>
able will be replaced with the current string for the URL
being fetched. Like in:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">curl http://{one,two}.site.com
-o &quot;file_#1.txt&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or use several variables
like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">curl
http://{site,host}.host[1-5].com -o &quot;#1_#2&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may use this option as many
times as the number of URLs you have.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See also the --create-dirs
option to create the local directories dynamically.
Specifying the output as &rsquo;-&rsquo; (a single dash)
will force the output to be done to stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O, --remote-name <br>
Write output to a local file named like the remote file we
get. (Only the file part of the remote file is used, the
path is cut off.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The remote file name to use for
saving is extracted from the given URL, nothing else.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Consequentially, the file will
be saved in the current working directory. If you want the
file saved in a different directory, make sure you change
current working direc&acirc; <br>
tory before you invoke curl with the -O, --remote-name
flag!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may use this option as many
times as the number of URLs you have.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, --proxytunnel <br>
When an HTTP proxy is used (-x, --proxy), this option will
cause non-HTTP protocols to attempt to tunnel through the
proxy instead of merely using it to do HTTP-like oper&acirc;
<br>
ations. The tunnel approach is made with the HTTP proxy
CONNECT request and requires that the proxy allows direct
connect to the remote port number curl wants to tunnel <br>
through to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P, --ftp-port &lt;address&gt;
<br>
(FTP) Reverses the default initiator/listener roles when
connecting with FTP. This switch makes curl use active mode.
In practice, curl then tells the server to connect <br>
back to the client&rsquo;s specified address and port, while
passive mode asks the server to setup an IP address and port
for it to connect to. &lt;address&gt; should be one of:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">interface <br>
i.e &quot;eth0&quot; to specify which interface&rsquo;s IP
address you want to use (Unix only)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IP address <br>
i.e &quot;192.168.10.1&quot; to specify the exact IP
address</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">host name <br>
i.e &quot;my.host.domain&quot; to specify the machine</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- make curl pick the same IP
address that is already used for the control connection</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option is used several
times, the last one will be used. Disable the use of PORT
with --ftp-pasv. Disable the attempt to use the EPRT command
instead of PORT by using <br>
--disable-eprt. EPRT is really PORT++.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Starting in 7.19.5, you can
append &quot;:[start]-[end]&quot; to the right of the
address, to tell curl what TCP port range to use. That means
you specify a port range, from a lower to a <br>
higher number. A single number works as well, but do note
that it increases the risk of failure since the port may not
be available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--pass &lt;phrase&gt; <br>
(SSL/SSH) Passphrase for the private key</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option is used several
times, the last one will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--post301 <br>
(HTTP) Tells curl to respect RFC 2616/10.3.2 and not convert
POST requests into GET requests when following a 301
redirection. The non-RFC behaviour is ubiquitous in web <br>
browsers, so curl does the conversion by default to maintain
consistency. However, a server may require a POST to remain
a POST after such a redirection. This option is <br>
meaningful only when using -L, --location (Added in
7.17.1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--post302 <br>
(HTTP) Tells curl to respect RFC 2616/10.3.2 and not convert
POST requests into GET requests when following a 302
redirection. The non-RFC behaviour is ubiquitous in web <br>
browsers, so curl does the conversion by default to maintain
consistency. However, a server may require a POST to remain
a POST after such a redirection. This option is <br>
meaningful only when using -L, --location (Added in
7.19.1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--post303 <br>
(HTTP) Tells curl to respect RFC 2616/10.3.2 and not convert
POST requests into GET requests when following a 303
redirection. The non-RFC behaviour is ubiquitous in web <br>
browsers, so curl does the conversion by default to maintain
consistency. However, a server may require a POST to remain
a POST after such a redirection. This option is <br>
meaningful only when using -L, --location (Added in
7.26.0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--proto &lt;protocols&gt; <br>
Tells curl to use the listed protocols for its initial
retrieval. Protocols are evaluated left to right, are comma
separated, and are each a protocol name or
&rsquo;all&rsquo;, <br>
optionally prefixed by zero or more modifiers. Available
modifiers are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+ Permit this protocol in
addition to protocols already permitted (this is the default
if no modifier is used).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Deny this protocol, removing
it from the list of protocols already permitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">= Permit only this protocol
(ignoring the list already permitted), though subject to
later modification by subsequent entries in the comma
separated list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--proto -ftps uses the default
protocols, but disables ftps</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--proto -all,https,+http <br>
only enables http and https</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--proto =http,https <br>
also only enables http and https</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unknown protocols produce a
warning. This allows scripts to safely rely on being able to
disable potentially dangerous protocols, without relying
upon support for that <br>
protocol being built into curl to avoid an error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option can be used multiple
times, in which case the effect is the same as concatenating
the protocols into one instance of the option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(Added in 7.20.2)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--proto-redir &lt;protocols&gt;
<br>
Tells curl to use the listed protocols after a redirect. See
--proto for how protocols are represented.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(Added in 7.20.2)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--proxy-anyauth <br>
Tells curl to pick a suitable authentication method when
communicating with the given proxy. This might cause an
extra request/response round-trip. (Added in 7.13.2)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--proxy-basic <br>
Tells curl to use HTTP Basic authentication when
communicating with the given proxy. Use --basic for enabling
HTTP Basic with a remote host. Basic is the default
authenti&acirc; <br>
cation method curl uses with proxies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--proxy-digest <br>
Tells curl to use HTTP Digest authentication when
communicating with the given proxy. Use --digest for
enabling HTTP Digest with a remote host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--proxy-negotiate <br>
Tells curl to use HTTP Negotiate authentication when
communicating with the given proxy. Use --negotiate for
enabling HTTP Negotiate with a remote host. (Added in
7.17.1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--proxy-ntlm <br>
Tells curl to use HTTP NTLM authentication when
communicating with the given proxy. Use --ntlm for enabling
NTLM with a remote host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--proxy1.0
&lt;proxyhost[:port]&gt; <br>
Use the specified HTTP 1.0 proxy. If the port number is not
specified, it is assumed at port 1080.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The only difference between this
and the HTTP proxy option (-x, --proxy), is that attempts to
use CONNECT through the proxy will specify an HTTP 1.0
protocol instead of <br>
the default HTTP 1.1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--pubkey &lt;key&gt; <br>
(SSH) Public key file name. Allows you to provide your
public key in this separate file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option is used several
times, the last one will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(As of 7.39.0, curl attempts to
automatically extract the public key from the private key
file, so passing this option is generally not required. Note
that this public key <br>
extraction requires libcurl to be linked against a copy of
libssh2 1.2.8 or higher that is itself linked against
OpenSSL.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q If used as the first
parameter on the command line, the curlrc config file will
not be read and used. See the -K, --config for details on
the default config file search <br>
path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Q, --quote &lt;command&gt; <br>
(FTP/SFTP) Send an arbitrary command to the remote FTP or
SFTP server. Quote commands are sent BEFORE the transfer
takes place (just after the initial PWD command in an <br>
FTP transfer, to be exact). To make commands take place
after a successful transfer, prefix them with a dash
&rsquo;-&rsquo;. To make commands be sent after curl has
changed the <br>
working directory, just before the transfer command(s),
prefix the command with a &rsquo;+&rsquo; (this is only
supported for FTP). You may specify any number of commands.
If the <br>
server returns failure for one of the commands, the entire
operation will be aborted. You must send syntactically
correct FTP commands as RFC 959 defines to FTP servers, <br>
or one of the commands listed below to SFTP servers. This
option can be used multiple times. When speaking to an FTP
server, prefix the command with an asterisk (*) to <br>
make curl continue even if the command fails as by default
curl will stop at first failure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SFTP is a binary protocol.
Unlike for FTP, curl interprets SFTP quote commands itself
before sending them to the server. File names may be quoted
shell-style to embed <br>
spaces or special characters. Following is the list of all
supported SFTP quote commands:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">chgrp group file <br>
The chgrp command sets the group ID of the file named by the
file operand to the group ID specified by the group operand.
The group operand is a decimal integer <br>
group ID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">chmod mode file <br>
The chmod command modifies the file mode bits of the
specified file. The mode operand is an octal integer mode
number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">chown user file <br>
The chown command sets the owner of the file named by the
file operand to the user ID specified by the user operand.
The user operand is a decimal integer user ID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ln source_file target_file <br>
The ln and symlink commands create a symbolic link at the
target_file location pointing to the source_file
location.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mkdir directory_name <br>
The mkdir command creates the directory named by the
directory_name operand.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pwd The pwd command returns the
absolute pathname of the current working directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rename source target <br>
The rename command renames the file or directory named by
the source operand to the destination path named by the
target operand.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rm file <br>
The rm command removes the file specified by the file
operand.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rmdir directory <br>
The rmdir command removes the directory entry specified by
the directory operand, provided it is empty.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">symlink source_file target_file
<br>
See ln.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, --range &lt;range&gt; <br>
(HTTP/FTP/SFTP/FILE) Retrieve a byte range (i.e a partial
document) from a HTTP/1.1, FTP or SFTP server or a local
FILE. Ranges can be specified in a number of ways.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0-499 specifies the first 500
bytes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">500-999 specifies the second 500
bytes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-500 specifies the last 500
bytes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">9500- specifies the bytes from
offset 9500 and forward</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0-0,-1 specifies the first and
last byte only(*)(H)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">500-700,600-799 <br>
specifies 300 bytes from offset 500(H)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">100-199,500-599 <br>
specifies two separate 100-byte ranges(*)(H)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(*) = NOTE that this will cause
the server to reply with a multipart response!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Only digit characters (0-9) are
valid in the &rsquo;start&rsquo; and &rsquo;stop&rsquo;
fields of the &rsquo;start-stop&rsquo; range syntax. If a
non-digit character is given in the range, the
server&rsquo;s response <br>
will be unspecified, depending on the server&rsquo;s
configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You should also be aware that
many HTTP/1.1 servers do not have this feature enabled, so
that when you attempt to get a range, you&rsquo;ll instead
get the whole document.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FTP and SFTP range downloads
only support the simple &rsquo;start-stop&rsquo; syntax
(optionally with one of the numbers omitted). FTP use
depends on the extended FTP command SIZE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option is used several
times, the last one will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R, --remote-time <br>
When used, this will make curl attempt to figure out the
timestamp of the remote file, and if that is available make
the local file get that same timestamp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--random-file &lt;file&gt; <br>
(SSL) Specify the path name to file containing what will be
considered as random data. The data is used to seed the
random engine for SSL connections. See also the --egd- <br>
file option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--raw (HTTP) When used, it
disables all internal HTTP decoding of content or transfer
encodings and instead makes them passed on unaltered, raw.
(Added in 7.16.2)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--remote-name-all <br>
This option changes the default action for all given URLs to
be dealt with as if -O, --remote-name were used for each
one. So if you want to disable that for a specific <br>
URL after --remote-name-all has been used, you must use
&quot;-o -&quot; or --no-remote-name. (Added in 7.19.0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--resolve
&lt;host:port:address&gt; <br>
Provide a custom address for a specific host and port pair.
Using this, you can make the curl requests(s) use a
specified address and prevent the otherwise normally <br>
resolved address to be used. Consider it a sort of
/etc/hosts alternative provided on the command line. The
port number should be the number used for the specific
protocol <br>
the host will be used for. It means you need several entries
if you want to provide address for the same host but
different ports.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option can be used many
times to add many host names to resolve.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(Added in 7.21.3)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--retry &lt;num&gt; <br>
If a transient error is returned when curl tries to perform
a transfer, it will retry this number of times before giving
up. Setting the number to 0 makes curl do no <br>
retries (which is the default). Transient error means
either: a timeout, an FTP 4xx response code or an HTTP 5xx
response code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When curl is about to retry a
transfer, it will first wait one second and then for all
forthcoming retries it will double the waiting time until it
reaches 10 minutes <br>
which then will be the delay between the rest of the
retries. By using --retry-delay you disable this exponential
backoff algorithm. See also --retry-max-time to limit <br>
the total time allowed for retries. (Added in 7.12.3)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option is used several
times, the last one will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--retry-delay &lt;seconds&gt;
<br>
Make curl sleep this amount of time before each retry when a
transfer has failed with a transient error (it changes the
default backoff time algorithm between retries). <br>
This option is only interesting if --retry is also used.
Setting this delay to zero will make curl use the default
backoff time. (Added in 7.12.3)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option is used several
times, the last one will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--retry-max-time &lt;seconds&gt;
<br>
The retry timer is reset before the first transfer attempt.
Retries will be done as usual (see --retry) as long as the
timer hasn&rsquo;t reached this given limit. Notice that
<br>
if the timer hasn&rsquo;t reached the limit, the request
will be made and while performing, it may take longer than
this given time period. To limit a single
request&Acirc;&acute;s maximum <br>
time, use -m, --max-time. Set this option to zero to not
timeout retries. (Added in 7.12.3)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option is used several
times, the last one will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --silent <br>
Silent or quiet mode. Don&rsquo;t show progress meter or
error messages. Makes Curl mute.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S, --show-error <br>
When used with -s it makes curl show an error message if it
fails.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ssl (FTP, POP3, IMAP, SMTP)
Try to use SSL/TLS for the connection. Reverts to a
non-secure connection if the server doesn&rsquo;t support
SSL/TLS. See also --ftp-ssl-control and <br>
--ssl-reqd for different levels of encryption required.
(Added in 7.20.0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option was formerly known

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ssl-allow-beast <br>
(SSL) This option tells curl to not work around a security
flaw in the SSL3 and TLS1.0 protocols known as BEAST. If
this option isn&rsquo;t used, the SSL layer may use work-
<br>
arounds known to cause interoperability problems with some
older SSL implementations. WARNING: this option loosens the
SSL security, and by using this flag you ask for <br>
exactly that. (Added in 7.25.0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--socks4 &lt;host[:port]&gt;
<br>
Use the specified SOCKS4 proxy. If the port number is not
specified, it is assumed at port 1080. (Added in 7.15.2)</p>

previous use of -x, --proxy, as they are mutually
exclusive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since 7.21.7, this option is
superfluous since you can specify a socks5 proxy with -x,
--proxy using a socks5:// protocol prefix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option is used several
times, the last one will be used. (This option was
previously wrongly documented and used as --socks without
the number appended.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option (as well as
--socks4) does not work with IPV6, FTPS or LDAP.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--socks5-gssapi-service
&lt;servicename&gt; <br>
The default service name for a socks server is
rcmd/server-fqdn. This option allows you to change it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples: --socks5 proxy-name
--socks5-gssapi-service sockd would use sockd/proxy-name
--socks5 proxy-name --socks5-gssapi-service sockd/real-name
would use sockd/real- <br>
name for cases where the proxy-name does not match the
principal name. (Added in 7.19.4).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--socks5-gssapi-nec <br>
As part of the gssapi negotiation a protection mode is
negotiated. RFC 1961 says in section 4.3/4.4 it should be
protected, but the NEC reference implementation does not.
<br>
The option --socks5-gssapi-nec allows the unprotected
exchange of the protection mode negotiation. (Added in
7.19.4).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--stderr &lt;file&gt; <br>
Redirect all writes to stderr to the specified file instead.
If the file name is a plain &rsquo;-&rsquo;, it is instead
written to stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option is used several
times, the last one will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t, --telnet-option
&lt;OPT=val&gt; <br>
Pass options to the telnet protocol. Supported options
are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TTYPE=&lt;term&gt; Sets the
terminal type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">XDISPLOC=&lt;X display&gt; Sets
the X display location.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NEW_ENV=&lt;var,val&gt; Sets an
environment variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T, --upload-file &lt;file&gt;
<br>
This transfers the specified local file to the remote URL.
If there is no file part in the specified URL, Curl will
append the local file name. NOTE that you must use a <br>
trailing / on the last directory to really prove to Curl
that there is no file name or curl will think that your last
directory name is the remote file name to use. That <br>
will most likely cause the upload operation to fail. If this
is used on an HTTP(S) server, the PUT command will be
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use the file name &quot;-&quot;
(a single dash) to use stdin instead of a given file.
Alternately, the file name &quot;.&quot; (a single period)
may be specified instead of &quot;-&quot; to use stdin <br>
in non-blocking mode to allow reading server output while
stdin is being uploaded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can specify one -T for each
URL on the command line. Each -T + URL pair specifies what
to upload and to where. curl also supports
&quot;globbing&quot; of the -T argument, mean&acirc; <br>
ing that you can upload multiple files to a single URL by
using the same URL globbing style supported in the URL, like
this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">curl -T
&quot;{file1,file2}&quot;
http://www.uploadtothissite.com</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or even</p>

&quot;img[1-1000].png&quot;
ftp://ftp.picturemania.com/upload/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--tcp-nodelay <br>
Turn on the TCP_NODELAY option. See the curl_easy_setopt(3)
man page for details about this option. (Added in
7.11.2)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--tftp-blksize &lt;value&gt;
<br>
(TFTP) Set TFTP BLKSIZE option (must be &gt;512). This is
the block size that curl will try to use when transferring
data to or from a TFTP server. By default 512 bytes will
<br>
be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option is used several
times, the last one will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(Added in 7.20.0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--tlsauthtype &lt;authtype&gt;
<br>
Set TLS authentication type. Currently, the only supported
option is &quot;SRP&quot;, for TLS-SRP (RFC 5054). If
--tlsuser and --tlspassword are specified but --tlsauthtype
is not, <br>
then this option defaults to &quot;SRP&quot;. (Added in
7.21.4)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--tlspassword &lt;password&gt;
<br>
Set password for use with the TLS authentication method
specified with --tlsauthtype. Requires that --tlsuser also
be set. (Added in 7.21.4)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--tlsuser &lt;user&gt; <br>
Set username for use with the TLS authentication method
specified with --tlsauthtype. Requires that --tlspassword
also be set. (Added in 7.21.4)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--tlsv1.0 <br>
(SSL) Forces curl to use TLS version 1.0 when negotiating
with a remote TLS server. (Added in 7.34.0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--tlsv1.1 <br>
(SSL) Forces curl to use TLS version 1.1 when negotiating
with a remote TLS server. (Added in 7.34.0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--tlsv1.2 <br>
(SSL) Forces curl to use TLS version 1.2 when negotiating
with a remote TLS server. (Added in 7.34.0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--tr-encoding <br>
(HTTP) Request a compressed Transfer-Encoding response using
one of the algorithms curl supports, and uncompress the data
while receiving it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(Added in 7.21.6)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--trace &lt;file&gt; <br>
Enables a full trace dump of all incoming and outgoing data,
including descriptive information, to the given output file.
Use &quot;-&quot; as filename to have the output sent to
<br>
stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option overrides previous
uses of -v, --verbose or --trace-ascii.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option is used several
times, the last one will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--trace-ascii &lt;file&gt; <br>
Enables a full trace dump of all incoming and outgoing data,
including descriptive information, to the given output file.
Use &quot;-&quot; as filename to have the output sent to
<br>
stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is very similar to --trace,
but leaves out the hex part and only shows the ASCII part of
the dump. It makes smaller output that might be easier to
read for untrained <br>
humans.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option overrides previous
uses of -v, --verbose or --trace.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option is used several
times, the last one will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--trace-time <br>
Prepends a time stamp to each trace or verbose line that
curl displays. (Added in 7.14.0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--unix-socket &lt;path&gt; <br>
(HTTP) Connect through this UNIX domain socket, instead of
using the network. (Added in 7.40.0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u, --user &lt;user:password&gt;
<br>
Specify the user name and password to use for server
authentication. Overrides -n, --netrc and
--netrc-optional.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you just give the user name
(without entering a colon) curl will prompt for a
password.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you use an SSPI-enabled curl
binary and do NTLM authentication, you can force curl to
pick up the user name and password from your environment by
simply specifying a <br>
single colon with this option: &quot;-u :&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option is used several
times, the last one will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U, --proxy-user
&lt;user:password&gt; <br>
Specify the user name and password to use for proxy
authentication.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you use an SSPI-enabled curl
binary and do NTLM authentication, you can force curl to
pick up the user name and password from your environment by
simply specifying a <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option is used several
times, the last one will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--url &lt;URL&gt; <br>
Specify a URL to fetch. This option is mostly handy when you
want to specify URL(s) in a config file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option may be used any
number of times. To control where this URL is written, use
the -o, --output or the -O, --remote-name options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
Makes the fetching more verbose/talkative. Mostly useful for
debugging. A line starting with &rsquo;&gt;&rsquo; means
&quot;header data&quot; sent by curl, &rsquo;&lt;&rsquo;
means &quot;header data&quot; received by curl <br>
that is hidden in normal cases, and a line starting with
&rsquo;*&rsquo; means additional info provided by curl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that if you only want HTTP
headers in the output, -i, --include might be the option
you&rsquo;re looking for.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you think this option still
doesn&rsquo;t give you enough details, consider using
--trace or --trace-ascii instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option overrides previous
uses of --trace-ascii or --trace.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use -s, --silent to make curl
quiet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w, --write-out &lt;format&gt;
<br>
Defines what to display on stdout after a completed and
successful operation. The format is a string that may
contain plain text mixed with any number of variables. The
<br>
string can be specified as &quot;string&quot;, to get read
from a particular file you specify it &quot;@filename&quot;
and to tell curl to read the format from stdin you write
&quot;@-&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The variables present in the
output format will be substituted by the value or text that
curl thinks fit, as described below. All variables are
specified as %{vari&acirc; <br>
able_name} and to output a normal % you just write them as
%%. You can output a newline by using 0 a carriage returnand
a tab space with . with</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: The %-symbol is a special
symbol in the win32-environment, where all occurrences of %
must be doubled when using this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The variables available are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">content_type The Content-Type of
the requested document, if there was any.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">filename_effective <br>
The ultimate filename that curl writes out to. This is only
meaningful if curl is told to write to a file with the
--remote-name or --output option. It&rsquo;s <br>
most useful in combination with the --remote-header-name
option. (Added in 7.25.1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ftp_entry_path The initial path
curl ended up in when logging on to the remote FTP server.
(Added in 7.15.4)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">http_code The numerical response
code that was found in the last retrieved HTTP(S) or FTP(s)
transfer. In 7.18.2 the alias response_code was added to
show the same <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">http_connect The numerical code
that was found in the last response (from a proxy) to a curl
CONNECT request. (Added in 7.12.4)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">local_ip The IP address of the
local end of the most recently done connection - can be
either IPv4 or IPv6 (Added in 7.29.0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">local_port The local port number
of the most recently done connection (Added in 7.29.0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">num_redirects Number of
redirects that were followed in the request. (Added in
7.12.3)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">redirect_url When an HTTP
request was made without -L to follow redirects, this
variable will show the actual URL a redirect would take you
to. (Added in 7.18.2)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">remote_ip The remote IP address
of the most recently done connection - can be either IPv4 or
IPv6 (Added in 7.29.0)</p>

speed that curl measured for the complete upload. Bytes per
second.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ssl_verify_result <br>
The result of the SSL peer certificate verification that was
requested. 0 means the verification was successful. (Added
in 7.19.0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">time_appconnect <br>
The time, in seconds, it took from the start until the
SSL/SSH/etc connect/handshake to the remote host was
completed. (Added in 7.19.0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">time_connect The time, in
seconds, it took from the start until the TCP connect to the
remote host (or proxy) was completed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">time_namelookup <br>
The time, in seconds, it took from the start until the name
resolving was completed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">time_pretransfer <br>
The time, in seconds, it took from the start until the file
transfer was just about to begin. This includes all
pre-transfer commands and negotiations that <br>
are specific to the particular protocol(s) involved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">time_redirect The time, in
seconds, it took for all redirection steps include name
lookup, connect, pretransfer and transfer before the final
transaction was started. <br>
time_redirect shows the complete execution time for multiple
redirections. (Added in 7.12.3)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">time_starttransfer <br>
The time, in seconds, it took from the start until the first
byte was just about to be transferred. This includes
time_pretransfer and also the time the <br>
server needed to calculate the result.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">time_total The total time, in
seconds, that the full operation lasted. The time will be
displayed with millisecond resolution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">url_effective The URL that was
fetched last. This is most meaningful if you&rsquo;ve told
curl to follow location: headers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option is used several
times, the last one will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x, --proxy
&lt;[protocol://][user:password@]proxyhost[:port]&gt; <br>
Use the specified HTTP proxy. If the port number is not
specified, it is assumed at port 1080.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option overrides existing
environment variables that set the proxy to use. If
there&rsquo;s an environment variable setting a proxy, you
can set proxy to &quot;&quot; to override it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All operations that are
performed over an HTTP proxy will transparently be converted
to HTTP. It means that certain protocol specific operations
might not be available. <br>
This is not the case if you can tunnel through the proxy, as
one with the -p, --proxytunnel option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">User and password that might be
provided in the proxy string are URL decoded by curl. This
allows you to pass in special characters such as @ by using
%40 or pass in a <br>
colon with %3a.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The proxy host can be specified
the exact same way as the proxy environment variables,
including the protocol prefix (http://) and the embedded
user + password.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">From 7.21.7, the proxy string
may be specified with a protocol:// prefix to specify
alternative proxy protocols. Use socks4://, socks4a://,
socks5:// or socks5h:// to <br>
request the specific SOCKS version to be used. No protocol
specified, http:// and all others will be treated as HTTP
proxies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option is used several
times, the last one will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X, --request &lt;command&gt;
<br>
(HTTP) Specifies a custom request method to use when
communicating with the HTTP server. The specified request
will be used instead of the method otherwise used (which
<br>
defaults to GET). Read the HTTP 1.1 specification for
details and explanations. Common additional HTTP requests
include PUT and DELETE, but related technologies like
Web&acirc; <br>
DAV offers PROPFIND, COPY, MOVE and more.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normally you don&rsquo;t need
this option. All sorts of GET, HEAD, POST and PUT requests
are rather invoked by using dedicated command line
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option only changes the
actual word used in the HTTP request, it does not alter the
way curl behaves. So for example if you want to make a
proper HEAD request, using <br>
-X HEAD will not suffice. You need to use the -I, --head
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(FTP) Specifies a custom FTP
command to use instead of LIST when doing file lists with
FTP.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option is used several
times, the last one will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--xattr <br>
When saving output to a file, this option tells curl to
store certain file metadata in extened file attributes.
Currently, the URL is stored in the xdg.origin.url <br>
attribute and, for HTTP, the content type is stored in the
mime_type attribute. If the file system does not support
extended attributes, a warning is issued.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-y, --speed-time &lt;time&gt;
<br>
If a download is slower than speed-limit bytes per second
during a speed-time period, the download gets aborted. If
speed-time is used, the default speed-limit will be 1 <br>
unless set with -Y.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option controls transfers
and thus will not affect slow connects etc. If this is a
concern for you, try the --connect-timeout option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option is used several
times, the last one will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Y, --speed-limit &lt;speed&gt;
<br>
If a download is slower than this given speed (in bytes per
second) for speed-time seconds it gets aborted. speed-time
is set with -y and is 30 if not set.</p>

times, the last one will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z, --time-cond &lt;date
expression&gt;|&lt;file&gt; <br>
(HTTP/FTP) Request a file that has been modified later than
the given time and date, or one that has been modified
before that time. The &lt;date expression&gt; can be all
sorts <br>
of date strings or if it doesn&rsquo;t match any internal
ones, it is taken as a filename and tries to get the
modification date (mtime) from &lt;file&gt; instead. See the

with your current user and password.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TLS-SRP <br>
SRP (Secure Remote Password) authentication is supported for
TLS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Metalink <br>
This curl supports Metalink (both version 3 and 4 (RFC
5854)), which describes mirrors and hashes. curl will use
mirrors for failover if there are errors (such as <br>
the file or server not being available).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
~/.curlrc <br>
Default config file, see -K, --config for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
The environment variables can be specified in lower case or
upper case. The lower case version has precedence.
http_proxy is an exception as it is only available in lower
case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using an environment variable to
set the proxy has the same effect as using the --proxy
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">http_proxy

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NO_PROXY &lt;comma-separated
list of hosts&gt; <br>
list of host names that shouldn&rsquo;t go through any
proxy. If set to a asterisk &rsquo;*&rsquo; only, it matches
all hosts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROXY PROTOCOL PREFIXES <br>
Since curl version 7.21.7, the proxy string may be specified
with a protocol:// prefix to specify alternative proxy
protocols.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no protocol is specified in
the proxy string or if the string doesn&rsquo;t match a
supported one, the proxy will be treated as an HTTP
proxy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The supported proxy protocol
prefixes are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">socks4:// <br>
Makes it the equivalent of --socks4</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">socks4a:// <br>
Makes it the equivalent of --socks4a</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">socks5:// <br>
Makes it the equivalent of --socks5</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">socks5h:// <br>
Makes it the equivalent of --socks5-hostname</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT CODES <br>
There are a bunch of different error codes and their
corresponding error messages that may appear during bad
conditions. At the time of this writing, the exit codes
are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 Unsupported protocol. This
build of curl has no support for this protocol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 Failed to initialize.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3 URL malformed. The syntax was
not correct.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4 A feature or option that was
needed to perform the desired request was not enabled or was
explicitly disabled at build-time. To make curl able to do
