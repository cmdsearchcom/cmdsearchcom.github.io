dselect - Debian package management frontend
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<b>dselect</b> [<i>option</i>...] [<i>command</i>...]
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>dselect</b> is one of the primary user interfaces for managing packages on a
  Debian system. At the <b>dselect</b> main menu, the system administrator can:
<br/>
 - Update the list of available package versions,
<br/>
 - View the status of installed and available packages,
<br/>
 - Alter package selections and manage dependencies,
<br/>
 - Install new packages or upgrade to newer versions.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>dselect</b> operates as a front-end to <b>dpkg</b>(1), the low-level debian
  package handling tool. It features a full-screen package selections manager
  with package depends and conflicts resolver. When run with administrator
  privileges, packages can be installed, upgraded and removed. Various access
  methods can be configured to retrieve available package version information
  and installable packages from package repositories. Depending on the used
  access method, these repositories can be public archive servers on the
  internet, local archive servers or cdroms. The recommended access method is
  <i>apt</i>, which is provided by the package <b>apt</b>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Normally <b>dselect</b> is invoked without parameters. An interactive menu is
  presented, offering the user a list of commands. If a command is given as
  argument, then that command is started immediately. Several command line
  parameters are still available to modify the running behaviour of
  <b>dselect</b> or show additional information about the program.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
All options can be specified both on the command line and in the <b>dselect</b>
  configuration file <i>/etc/dpkg/dselect.cfg</i> or the files on the
  configuration directory <i>/etc/dpkg/dselect.cfg.d/</i>. Each line in the
  configuration file is either an option (exactly the same as the command line
  option but without leading hyphens) or a comment (if it starts with a &#x2018;
  <b>#</b>&#x2019;).

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="COMMANDS"><a class="selflink" href="#COMMANDS">COMMANDS</a></h1>
When <b>dselect</b> is started it can perform the following commands, either
  directly if it was specified on the command line or by prompting the user with
  a menu of available commands if running interactively:
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="access"><a class="selflink" href="#access">access</a></h2>
Choose and configure an access method to access package repositories.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
By default, <b>dselect</b> provides several methods such as <i>cdrom</i>,
  <i>multi_cd</i>, <i>nfs</i>, <i>multi_nfs</i>, <i>harddisk</i>,
  <i>mounted</i>, <i>multi_mount</i>, <i>floppy</i> or <i>ftp</i>, but other
  packages may provide additional methods, eg. the <i>apt</i> access method
  provided by the <b>apt</b> package.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The use of the <i>apt</i> access method is strongly recommended.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="update"><a class="selflink" href="#update">update</a></h2>
Refresh the available packages database.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Retrieves a list of available package versions from the package repository,
  configured for the current access method, and update the dpkg database. The
  package lists are commonly provided by the repository as files named
  <i>Packages</i> or <i>Packages.gz</i>. These files can be generated by
  repository maintainers, using the program <b>dpkg-scanpackages</b>(1).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Details of the update command depend on the access method's implementation.
  Normally the process is straightforward and requires no user interaction.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="select"><a class="selflink" href="#select">select</a></h2>
View or manage package selections and dependencies.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This is the main function of <b>dselect</b>. In the select screen, the user can
  review a list of all available and installed packages. When run with
  administrator privileges, it is also possible to interactively change packages
  selection state. <b>dselect</b> tracks the implications of these changes to
  other depending or conflicting packages.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
When a conflict or failed depends is detected, a dependency resolution subscreen
  is prompted to the user. In this screen, a list of conflicting or depending
  packages is shown, and for each package listed, the reason for its listing is
  shown. The user may apply the suggestions proposed by <b>dselect</b>, override
  them, or back out all the changes, including the ones that created the
  unresolved depends or conflicts.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The use of the interactive package selections management screen is explained in
  more detail below.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="install"><a class="selflink" href="#install">install</a></h2>
Installs selected packages.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The configured access method will fetch installable or upgradable packages from
  the relevant repositories and install these using <b>dpkg</b>. Depending on
  the implementation of the access method, all packages can be prefetched before
  installation, or fetched when needed. Some access methods may also remove
  packages that were marked for removal.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If an error occurred during install, it is usually advisable to run install
  again. In most cases, the problems will disappear or be solved. If problems
  persist or the installation performed was incorrect, please investigate into
  the causes and circumstances, and file a bug in the Debian bug tracking
  system. Instructions on how to do this can be found at
  https://bugs.debian.org/ or by reading the documentation for <b>bug</b>(1) or
  <b>reportbug</b>(1), if these are installed.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Details of the install command depend on the access method's implementation. The
  user's attention and input may be required during installation, configuration
  or removal of packages. This depends on the maintainer scripts in the package.
  Some packages make use of the <b>debconf</b>(1) library, allowing for more
  flexible or even automated installation setups.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="config"><a class="selflink" href="#config">config</a></h2>
Configures any previously installed, but not fully configured packages.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="remove"><a class="selflink" href="#remove">remove</a></h2>
Removes or purges installed packages, that are marked for removal.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="quit"><a class="selflink" href="#quit">quit</a></h2>
Quit <b>dselect</b>.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Exits the program with zero (successful) errorcode.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>

  SELECTIONS MANAGEMENT</a></h1>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Introduction"><a class="selflink" href="#Introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<b>dselect</b> directly exposes the administrator to some of the complexities
  involved with managing large sets of packages with many interdependencies. For
  a user who is unfamiliar with the concepts and the ways of the debian package
  management system, it can be quite overwhelming. Although <b>dselect</b> is
  aimed at easing package management and administration, it is only instrumental
  in doing so and can not be assumed to be a sufficient substitute for
  administrator skill and understanding. The user is required to be familiar
  with the concepts underlying the Debian packaging system. In case of doubt,
  consult the <b>dpkg</b>(1) manpage and the distribution policy.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Unless <b>dselect</b> is run in expert or immediate mode, a help screen is first
  displayed when choosing this command from the menu. The user is
  <i>strongly</i> advised to study all of the information presented in the
  online help screens, when one pops up. The online help screens can at any time
  be invoked with the &#x2018; <b>?</b>&#x2019; key.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Screen_layout"><a class="selflink" href="#Screen_layout">Screen
  layout</a></h2>
The select screen is by default split in a top and a bottom half. The top half
  shows a list of packages. A cursor bar can select an individual package, or a
  group of packages, if applicable, by selecting the group header. The bottom
  half of the screen shows some details about the package currently selected in
  the top half of the screen. The type of detail that is displayed can be
  varied.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Pressing the &#x2018; <b>I</b>&#x2019; key toggles a full-screen display of the
  packages list, an enlarged view of the package details, or the equally split
  screen.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Package_details_view"><a class="selflink" href="#Package_details_view">Package
  details view</a></h2>
The package details view by default shows the extended package description for
  the package that is currently selected in the packages status list. The type
  of detail can be toggled by pressing the &#x2018; <b>i</b>&#x2019; key. This
  alternates between:
<br/>
 - the extended description
<br/>
 - the control information for the installed version
<br/>
 - the control information for the available version
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
In a dependency resolution screen, there is also the possibility of viewing the
  specific unresolved depends or conflicts related to the package and causing it
  to be listed.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Packages_status_list"><a class="selflink" href="#Packages_status_list">Packages
  status list</a></h2>
The main select screen displays a list of all packages known to the debian
  package management system. This includes packages installed on the system and
  packages known from the available packages database.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
For every package, the list shows the package's status, priority, section,
  installed and available architecture, installed and available versions, the
  package name and its short description, all in one line. By pressing the
  &#x2018; <b>A</b>&#x2019; key, the display of the installed and available
  architecture can be toggled between on an off. By pressing the &#x2018;
  <b>V</b>&#x2019; key, the display of the installed and available version can
  be toggled between on an off. By pressing the &#x2018; <b>v</b>&#x2019; key,
  the package status display is toggled between verbose and shorthand. Shorthand
  display is the default.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The shorthand status indication consists of four parts: an error flag, which
  should normally be clear, the current status, the last selection state and the
  current selection state. The first two relate to the actual state of the
  package, the second pair are about the selections set by the user.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
These are the meanings of the shorthand package status indicator codes:
<br/>
 Error flag:
<br/>
 <i>empty</i> no error
<br/>
 <b>R</b> serious error, needs reinstallation;
<br/>
 Installed state:
<br/>
 <i>empty</i> not installed;
<br/>
 <b>*</b> fully installed and configured;
<br/>
 <b>-</b> not installed but some config files may remain;
<br/>
 <b>U</b> unpacked but not yet configured;
<br/>
 <b>C</b> half-configured (an error happened);
<br/>
 <b>I</b> half-installed (an error happened).
<br/>
 Current and requested selections:
<br/>
 <b>*</b> marked for installation or upgrade;
<br/>
 <b>-</b> marked for removal, configuration files remain;
<br/>
 <b>=</b> on hold: package will not be processed at all;
<br/>
 <b>_</b> marked for purge, also remove configuration;
<br/>
 <b>n</b> package is new and has yet to be marked.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Cursor_and_screen_movement"><a class="selflink" href="#Cursor_and_screen_movement">Cursor
  and screen movement</a></h2>
The package selection list and the dependency conflict resolution screens can be
  navigated using motion commands mapped to the following keys:
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 <b>p, Up, k</b> move cursor bar up
<br/>
 <b>n, Down, j</b> move cursor bar down
<br/>
 <b>P, Pgup, Backspace</b> scroll list 1 page up
<br/>
 <b>N, Pgdn, Space</b> scroll list 1 page down
<br/>
 <b>^p</b> scroll list 1 line up
<br/>
 <b>^n</b> scroll list 1 line down
<br/>
 <b>t, Home</b> jump to top of list
<br/>
 <b>e, End</b> jump to end of list
<br/>
 <b>u</b> scroll info 1 page up
<br/>
 <b>d</b> scroll info 1 page down
<br/>
 <b>^u</b> scroll info 1 line up
<br/>
 <b>^d</b> scroll info 1 line down

 <b>B, Left-arrow</b> pan display 1/3 screen left
<br/>
 <b>F, Right-arrow</b> pan display 1/3 screen right
<br/>
 <b>^b</b> pan display 1 character left
<br/>
 <b>^f</b> pan display 1 character right
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Searching_and_sorting"><a class="selflink" href="#Searching_and_sorting">Searching
  and sorting</a></h2>
The list of packages can be searched by package name. This is done by pressing
  &#x2018; <b>/</b>&#x2019;, and typing a simple search string. The string is
  interpreted as a <b>regex</b>(7) regular expression. If you add &#x2018;
  <b>/d</b>&#x2019; to the search expression, dselect will also search in
  descriptions. If you add &#x2018; <b>/i</b>&#x2019; the search will be case
  insensitive. You may combine these two suffixes like this: &#x2018;
  <b>/id</b>&#x2019;. Repeated searching is accomplished by repeatedly pressing
  the &#x2018; <b>n</b>&#x2019; or &#x2018;<b>\</b>&#x2019; keys, until the
  wanted package is found. If the search reaches the bottom of the list, it
  wraps to the top and continues searching from there.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The list sort order can be varied by pressing the &#x2018; <b>o</b>&#x2019; and
  &#x2018; <b>O</b>&#x2019; keys repeatedly. The following nine sort orderings
  can be selected:
<br/>
 alphabet available status
<br/>
 priority+section available+priority status+priority
<br/>
 section+priority available+section status+section
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
Where not listed above explicitly, alphabetic order is used as the final
  subordering sort key.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Altering_selections"><a class="selflink" href="#Altering_selections">Altering
  selections</a></h2>
The requested selection state of individual packages may be altered with the
  following commands:
<br/>
 <b>+, Insert</b> install or upgrade
<br/>
 <b>=, H</b> hold in present state and version
<br/>
 <b>:, G</b> unhold: upgrade or leave uninstalled
<br/>
 <b>-, Delete</b> remove, but leave configuration
<br/>
 <b>_</b> remove &amp; purge configuration
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
When the change request results in one or more unsatisfied depends or conflicts,
  <b>dselect</b> prompts the user with a dependency resolution screen. This will
  be further explained below.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
It is also possible to apply these commands to groups of package selections, by
  pointing the cursor bar onto a group header. The exact grouping of packages is
  dependent on the current list ordering settings.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Proper care should be taken when altering large groups of selections, because
  this can instantaneously create large numbers of unresolved depends or
  conflicts, all of which will be listed in one dependency resolution screen,
  making them very hard to handle. In practice, only hold and unhold operations
  are useful when applied to groups.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Resolving_depends_and_conflicts"><a class="selflink" href="#Resolving_depends_and_conflicts">Resolving
  depends and conflicts</a></h2>
When the change request results in one or more unsatisfied depends or conflicts,
  <b>dselect</b> prompts the user with a dependency resolution screen. First
  however, an informative help screen is displayed.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The top half of this screen lists all the packages that will have unresolved
  depends or conflicts, as a result of the requested change, and all the
  packages whose installation can resolve any of these depends or whose removal
  can resolve any of the conflicts. The bottom half defaults to show the depends
  or conflicts that cause the currently selected package to be listed.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
When the sublist of packages is displayed initially, <b>dselect</b> may have
  already set the requested selection status of some of the listed packages, in
  order to resolve the depends or conflicts that caused the dependency
  resolution screen to be displayed. Usually, it is best to follow up the
  suggestions made by <b>dselect</b>.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The listed packages' selection state may be reverted to the original settings,
  as they were before the unresolved depends or conflicts were created, by
  pressing the &#x2018; <b>R</b>&#x2019; key. By pressing the &#x2018;
  <b>D</b>&#x2019; key, the automatic suggestions are reset, but the change that
  caused the dependency resolution screen to be prompted is kept as requested.
  Finally, by pressing &#x2018; <b>U</b>&#x2019;, the selections are again set
  to the automatic suggestion values.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Establishing_the_requested_selections"><a class="selflink" href="#Establishing_the_requested_selections">Establishing
  the requested selections</a></h2>
By pressing <b>enter</b>, the currently displayed set of selections is accepted.
  If <b>dselect</b> detects no unresolved depends as a result of the requested
  selections, the new selections will be set. However, if there are any
  unresolved depends, <b>dselect</b> will again prompt the user with a
  dependency resolution screen.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
To alter a set of selections that creates unresolved depends or conflicts and
  forcing <b>dselect</b> to accept it, press the &#x2018;<b>Q</b>&#x2019; key.
  This sets the selections as specified by the user, unconditionally. Generally,
  don't do this unless you've read the fine print.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The opposite effect, to back out any selections change requests and go back to
  the previous list of selections, is attained by pressing the &#x2018;
  <b>X</b>&#x2019; or <b>escape</b> keys. By repeatedly pressing these keys, any
  possibly detrimental changes to the requested package selections can be backed
  out completely to the last established settings.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If you mistakenly establish some settings and wish to revert all the selections
  to what is currently installed on the system, press the &#x2018;
  <b>C</b>&#x2019; key. This is somewhat similar to using the unhold command on
  all packages, but provides a more obvious panic button in cases where the user
  pressed <b>enter</b> by accident.
