<p>dselect(1) Debian dselect(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
dselect - Debian package management frontend</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
dselect [option...] [command...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
dselect is one of the primary user interfaces for managing
packages on a Debian system. At the dselect main menu, the
system administrator can: <br>
- Update the list of available package versions, <br>
- View the status of installed and available packages, <br>
- Alter package selections and manage dependencies, <br>
- Install new packages or upgrade to newer versions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dselect operates as a front-end
to dpkg(1), the low-level debian package handling tool. It
features a full-screen package selections manager with
package depends and conflicts <br>
resolver. When run with administrator privileges, packages
can be installed, upgraded and removed. Various access
methods can be configured to retrieve available package
version <br>
information and installable packages from package
repositories. Depending on the used access method, these
repositories can be public archive servers on the internet,
local ar&acirc; <br>
chive servers or cdroms. The recommended access method is
apt, which is provided by the package apt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normally dselect is invoked
without parameters. An interactive menu is presented,
offering the user a list of commands. If a command is given
as argument, then that command is <br>
started immediately. Several command line parameters are
still available to modify the running behaviour of dselect
or show additional information about the program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
All options can be specified both on the command line and in
the dselect configuration file /etc/dpkg/dselect.cfg or the
files on the configuration directory /etc/dpkg/dse&acirc;
<br>
lect.cfg.d/. Each line in the configuration file is either
an option (exactly the same as the command line option but
without leading hyphens) or a comment (if it starts with a
<br>
&acirc;#&acirc;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--admindir directory <br>
Changes the directory where the dpkg &acirc;status&acirc;,
&acirc;available&acirc; and similar files are located. This
defaults to /var/lib/dpkg and normally there shouldn&rsquo;t
be any need to <br>
change it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Dfile, --debug file <br>
Turn on debugging. Debugging information is sent to
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--expert <br>
Turns on expert mode, i.e. doesn&rsquo;t display possibly
annoying help messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--colour|--color
screenpart:[foreground],[background][:attr[+attr]...] <br>
Configures screen colors. This works only if your display
supports colors. This option may be used multiple times (and
is best used in dselect.cfg). Each use changes the <br>
color (and optionally, other attributes) of one part of the
screen. The parts of the screen (from top to bottom)
are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">title The screen title.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">listhead <br>
The header line above the list of packages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list The scrolling list of
packages (and also some help text).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">listsel <br>
The selected item in the list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pkgstate <br>
In the list of packages, the text indicating the current
state of each package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pkgstatesel <br>
In the list of packages, the text indicating the current
state of the currently selected package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">infohead <br>
The header line that displays the state of the currently
selected package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">infodesc <br>
The package&rsquo;s short description.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">info Used to display package
info such as the package&rsquo;s description.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">infofoot <br>
The last line of the screen when selecting packages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">query Used to display query
lines</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">helpscreen <br>
Color of help screens.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After the part of the screen
comes a colon and the color specification. You can specify
either the foreground color, the background color, or both,
overriding the com&acirc; <br>
piled-in colors. Use standard curses color names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Optionally, after the color
specification is another colon, and an attribute
specification. This is a list of one or more attributes,
separated by plus (&acirc;+&acirc;) characters. <br>
Available attributes include (not all of these will work on
all terminals): normal, standout, underline, reverse, blink,
bright, dim, bold</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-?, --help <br>
Print a brief help text and exit successfully.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Print version information and exit successfully.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMANDS <br>
When dselect is started it can perform the following
commands, either directly if it was specified on the command
line or by prompting the user with a menu of available
commands <br>
if running interactively:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">access <br>
Choose and configure an access method to access package
repositories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, dselect provides
several methods such as cdrom, multi_cd, nfs, multi_nfs,
harddisk, mounted, multi_mount, floppy or ftp, but other
packages may provide additional <br>
methods, eg. the apt access method provided by the apt
package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The use of the apt access method
is strongly recommended.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">update <br>
Refresh the available packages database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Retrieves a list of available
package versions from the package repository, configured for
the current access method, and update the dpkg database. The
package lists are commonly <br>
provided by the repository as files named Packages or
Packages.gz. These files can be generated by repository
maintainers, using the program dpkg-scanpackages(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Details of the update command
depend on the access method&rsquo;s implementation. Normally
the process is straightforward and requires no user
interaction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">select <br>
View or manage package selections and dependencies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is the main function of
dselect. In the select screen, the user can review a list of
all available and installed packages. When run with
administrator privileges, it is also <br>
possible to interactively change packages selection state.
dselect tracks the implications of these changes to other
depending or conflicting packages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a conflict or failed
depends is detected, a dependency resolution subscreen is
prompted to the user. In this screen, a list of conflicting
or depending packages is shown, <br>
and for each package listed, the reason for its listing is
shown. The user may apply the suggestions proposed by
dselect, override them, or back out all the changes,
including <br>
the ones that created the unresolved depends or
conflicts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The use of the interactive
package selections management screen is explained in more
detail below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">install <br>
Installs selected packages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The configured access method
will fetch installable or upgradable packages from the
relevant repositories and install these using dpkg.
Depending on the implementation of the <br>
access method, all packages can be prefetched before
installation, or fetched when needed. Some access methods
may also remove packages that were marked for removal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If an error occurred during
install, it is usually advisable to run install again. In
most cases, the problems will disappear or be solved. If
problems persist or the installa&acirc; <br>
tion performed was incorrect, please investigate into the
causes and circumstances, and file a bug in the Debian bug
tracking system. Instructions on how to do this can be found
<br>
at https://bugs.debian.org/ or by reading the documentation
for bug(1) or reportbug(1), if these are installed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Details of the install command
depend on the access method&rsquo;s implementation. The
user&rsquo;s attention and input may be required during
installation, configuration or removal of <br>
packages. This depends on the maintainer scripts in the
package. Some packages make use of the debconf(1) library,
allowing for more flexible or even automated installation
set&acirc; <br>
ups.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">config <br>
Configures any previously installed, but not fully
configured packages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">remove <br>
Removes or purges installed packages, that are marked for
removal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">quit <br>
Quit dselect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Exits the program with zero
(successful) errorcode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PACKAGE SELECTIONS MANAGEMENT
<br>
Introduction <br>
dselect directly exposes the administrator to some of the
complexities involved with managing large sets of packages
with many interdependencies. For a user who is unfamiliar
<br>
with the concepts and the ways of the debian package
management system, it can be quite overwhelming. Although
dselect is aimed at easing package management and
administration, <br>
it is only instrumental in doing so and can not be assumed
to be a sufficient substitute for administrator skill and
understanding. The user is required to be familiar with the
<br>
concepts underlying the Debian packaging system. In case of
doubt, consult the dpkg(1) manpage and the distribution
policy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unless dselect is run in expert
or immediate mode, a help screen is first displayed when
choosing this command from the menu. The user is strongly
advised to study all of the <br>
information presented in the online help screens, when one
pops up. The online help screens can at any time be invoked
with the &acirc;?&acirc; key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Screen layout <br>
The select screen is by default split in a top and a bottom
half. The top half shows a list of packages. A cursor bar
can select an individual package, or a group of packages,
<br>
if applicable, by selecting the group header. The bottom
half of the screen shows some details about the package
currently selected in the top half of the screen. The type
of <br>
detail that is displayed can be varied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pressing the &acirc;I&acirc; key
toggles a full-screen display of the packages list, an
enlarged view of the package details, or the equally split
screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Package details view <br>
The package details view by default shows the extended
package description for the package that is currently
selected in the packages status list. The type of detail can
be tog&acirc; <br>
gled by pressing the &acirc;i&acirc; key. This alternates
between: <br>
- the extended description <br>
- the control information for the installed version <br>
- the control information for the available version</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In a dependency resolution
screen, there is also the possibility of viewing the
specific unresolved depends or conflicts related to the
package and causing it to be listed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Packages status list <br>
The main select screen displays a list of all packages known
to the debian package management system. This includes
packages installed on the system and packages known from the
<br>
available packages database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For every package, the list
shows the package&rsquo;s status, priority, section,
installed and available architecture, installed and
available versions, the package name and its short <br>
description, all in one line. By pressing the
&acirc;A&acirc; key, the display of the installed and
available architecture can be toggled between on an off. By
pressing the &acirc;V&acirc; key, the <br>
display of the installed and available version can be
toggled between on an off. By pressing the &acirc;v&acirc;
key, the package status display is toggled between verbose
and shorthand. <br>
Shorthand display is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The shorthand status indication
consists of four parts: an error flag, which should normally
be clear, the current status, the last selection state and
the current selection <br>
state. The first two relate to the actual state of the
package, the second pair are about the selections set by the
user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These are the meanings of the
shorthand package status indicator codes: <br>
Error flag: <br>
empty no error <br>
R serious error, needs reinstallation; <br>
Installed state: <br>
empty not installed; <br>
* fully installed and configured; <br>
- not installed but some config files may remain; <br>
U unpacked but not yet configured; <br>
C half-configured (an error happened); <br>
I half-installed (an error happened). <br>
Current and requested selections: <br>
* marked for installation or upgrade; <br>
- marked for removal, configuration files remain; <br>
= on hold: package will not be processed at all; <br>
_ marked for purge, also remove configuration; <br>
n package is new and has yet to be marked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cursor and screen movement <br>
The package selection list and the dependency conflict
resolution screens can be navigated using motion commands
mapped to the following keys: <br>
p, Up, k move cursor bar up <br>
n, Down, j move cursor bar down <br>
P, Pgup, Backspace scroll list 1 page up <br>
N, Pgdn, Space scroll list 1 page down <br>
^p scroll list 1 line up <br>
^n scroll list 1 line down <br>
t, Home jump to top of list <br>
e, End jump to end of list <br>
u scroll info 1 page up <br>
d scroll info 1 page down <br>
^u scroll info 1 line up <br>
^d scroll info 1 line down <br>
B, Left-arrow pan display 1/3 screen left <br>
F, Right-arrow pan display 1/3 screen right <br>
^b pan display 1 character left <br>
^f pan display 1 character right</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Searching and sorting <br>
The list of packages can be searched by package name. This
is done by pressing &acirc;/&acirc;, and typing a simple
search string. The string is interpreted as a regex(7)
regular expression. <br>
If you add &acirc;/d&acirc; to the search expression,
dselect will also search in descriptions. If you add
&acirc;/i&acirc; the search will be case insensitive. You
may combine these two suffixes like <br>
this: &acirc;/id&acirc;. Repeated searching is accomplished
by repeatedly pressing the &acirc;n&acirc; or &acirc;&acirc;
keys, until the wanted package is found. If the search
reaches the bottom of the list, it <br>
wraps to the top and continues searching from there.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The list sort order can be
varied by pressing the &acirc;o&acirc; and &acirc;O&acirc;
keys repeatedly. The following nine sort orderings can be
selected: <br>
alphabet available status <br>
priority+section available+priority status+priority <br>
section+priority available+section status+section <br>
Where not listed above explicitly, alphabetic order is used
as the final subordering sort key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Altering selections <br>
The requested selection state of individual packages may be
altered with the following commands: <br>
+, Insert install or upgrade <br>
=, H hold in present state and version <br>
:, G unhold: upgrade or leave uninstalled <br>
-, Delete remove, but leave configuration <br>
_ remove &amp; purge configuration</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the change request results
in one or more unsatisfied depends or conflicts, dselect
prompts the user with a dependency resolution screen. This
will be further explained <br>
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is also possible to apply
these commands to groups of package selections, by pointing
the cursor bar onto a group header. The exact grouping of
packages is dependent on the <br>
current list ordering settings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Proper care should be taken when
altering large groups of selections, because this can
instantaneously create large numbers of unresolved depends
or conflicts, all of which will <br>
be listed in one dependency resolution screen, making them
very hard to handle. In practice, only hold and unhold
operations are useful when applied to groups.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Resolving depends and conflicts
<br>
When the change request results in one or more unsatisfied
depends or conflicts, dselect prompts the user with a
dependency resolution screen. First however, an informative
help <br>
screen is displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The top half of this screen
lists all the packages that will have unresolved depends or
conflicts, as a result of the requested change, and all the
packages whose installation <br>
can resolve any of these depends or whose removal can
resolve any of the conflicts. The bottom half defaults to
show the depends or conflicts that cause the currently
selected <br>
package to be listed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the sublist of packages is
displayed initially, dselect may have already set the
requested selection status of some of the listed packages,
in order to resolve the depends <br>
or conflicts that caused the dependency resolution screen to
be displayed. Usually, it is best to follow up the
suggestions made by dselect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The listed packages&rsquo;
selection state may be reverted to the original settings, as
they were before the unresolved depends or conflicts were
created, by pressing the &acirc;R&acirc; key. By <br>
pressing the &acirc;D&acirc; key, the automatic suggestions
are reset, but the change that caused the dependency
resolution screen to be prompted is kept as requested.
Finally, by pressing <br>
&acirc;U&acirc;, the selections are again set to the
automatic suggestion values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Establishing the requested
selections <br>
By pressing enter, the currently displayed set of selections
is accepted. If dselect detects no unresolved depends as a
result of the requested selections, the new selections <br>
will be set. However, if there are any unresolved depends,
dselect will again prompt the user with a dependency
resolution screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To alter a set of selections
that creates unresolved depends or conflicts and forcing
dselect to accept it, press the &acirc;Q&acirc; key. This
sets the selections as specified by the user, <br>
unconditionally. Generally, don&rsquo;t do this unless
you&rsquo;ve read the fine print.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The opposite effect, to back out
any selections change requests and go back to the previous
list of selections, is attained by pressing the
&acirc;X&acirc; or escape keys. By repeatedly <br>
pressing these keys, any possibly detrimental changes to the
requested package selections can be backed out completely to
the last established settings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you mistakenly establish some
settings and wish to revert all the selections to what is
currently installed on the system, press the &acirc;C&acirc;
key. This is somewhat similar to <br>
using the unhold command on all packages, but provides a
more obvious panic button in cases where the user pressed
enter by accident.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
0 The requested command was successfully performed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 Fatal or unrecoverable error
due to invalid command-line usage, or interactions with the
system, such as accesses to the database, memory
allocations, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
HOME If set, dselect will use it as the directory from which
to read the user specific configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
The dselect package selection interface is confusing to some
new users. Reportedly, it even makes seasoned kernel
developers cry.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The documentation is
lacking.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is no help option in the
main menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The visible list of available
packages cannot be reduced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The built in access methods can
no longer stand up to current quality standards. Use the
access method provided by apt, it is not only not broken, it
is also much more flexible <br>
than the built in access methods.</p>
