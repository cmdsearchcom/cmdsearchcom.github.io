<p>RZ(1) General Commands Manual RZ(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
rx, rb, rz - XMODEM, YMODEM, ZMODEM (Batch) file receive</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
rz [- +8abeOpqRtTuUvy] <br>
rb [- +abqRtuUvy] <br>
rx [- abceqRtuUv] file <br>
[-][v]rzCOMMAND</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This program uses error correcting protocols to receive
files over a dial-in serial port from a variety of programs
running under PC-DOS, CP/M, Unix, and other operating
systems. <br>
It is invoked from a shell prompt manually, or automatically
as a result of an &quot;sz file ...&quot; command given to
the calling program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">While rz is smart enough to be
called from cu(1), very few versions of cu(1) are smart
enough to allow rz to work properly. Unix flavors of
Professional-YAM are available for <br>
such dial-out application.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Rz (Receive ZMODEM) receives
files with the ZMODEM batch protocol. Pathnames are supplied
by the sending program, and directories are made if
necessary (and possible). Nor&acirc; <br>
mally, the &quot;rz&quot; command is automatically issued by
the calling ZMODEM program, but some defective ZMODEM
implementations may require starting rz the old fashioned
way.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Rb receives file(s) with YMODEM,
accepting either standard 128 byte sectors or 1024 byte
sectors (YAM sb -k option). The user should determine when
the 1024 byte block length <br>
actually improves throughput without causing lost data or
even system crashes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If True YMODEM (Omen Technology
trademark) file information (file length, etc.) is received,
the file length controls the number of bytes written to the
output dataset, and the <br>
modify time and file mode (iff non zero) are set
accordingly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no True YMODEM file
information is received, slashes in the pathname are changed
to underscore, and any trailing period in the pathname is
eliminated. This conversion is use&acirc; <br>
ful for files received from CP/M systems. With YMODEM, each
file name is converted to lower case unless it contains one
or more lower case letters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Rx receives a single file with
XMODEM or XMODEM-1k protocol. The user should determine when
the 1024 byte block length actually improves throughput
without causing problems. <br>
The user must supply the file name to both sending and
receiving programs. Up to 1023 garbage characters may be
added to the received file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Rz may be invoked as rzCOMMAND
(with an optional leading - as generated by login(1)). For
each received file, rz will pipe the file to
&lsquo;&lsquo;COMMAND filename&rsquo;&rsquo; where filename
is the <br>
name of the transmitted file with the file contents as
standard input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each file transfer is
acknowledged when COMMAND exits with 0 status. A non zero
exit status terminates transfers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A typical use for this form is
rzrmail which calls rmail(1) to post mail to the user
specified by the transmitted file name. For example, sending
the file &quot;caf&quot; from a PC-DOS <br>
system to rzrmail on a Unix system would result in the
contents of the DOS file &quot;caf&quot; being mailed to
user &quot;caf&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On some Unix systems, the login
directory must contain a link to COMMAND as login sets
SHELL=rsh which disallows absolute pathnames. If invoked
with a leading &lsquo;&lsquo;v&rsquo;&rsquo;, rz will be
<br>
verbose (see v option). The following entry works for Unix
SYS III/V: <br>
rzrmail::5:1::/bin:/usr/local/rzrmail <br>
If the SHELL environment variable includes rsh , rbash or
rksh (restricted shell), rz will not accept absolute
pathnames or references to a parent directory, will not
modify an <br>
existing file, and removes any files received in error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If rz is invoked with stdout and
stderr to different datasets, Verbose is set to 2, causing
frame by frame progress reports to stderr. This may be
disabled with the q option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The meanings of the available options are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-+, --append <br>
append received data to an existing file (ZMODEM, ASCII
only). <br>
-a, --ascii <br>
Convert files to Unix conventions by stripping carriage
returns and all characters beginning with the first Control
Z (CP/M end of file). <br>
-b, --binary <br>
Binary (tell it like it is) file transfer override. <br>
-B NUMBER, --bufsize NUMBER <br>
Buffer NUMBER bytes before writing to disk. Default ist
32768, which should be enough for most situations. If you
have a slow machine or a bad disk interface or suffer <br>
from other hardware problems you might want to increase the
buffersize. -1 or auto use a buffer large enough to buffer
the whole file. Be careful with this options - <br>
things normally get worse, not better, if the machine starts
to swap. <br>
-c, --with-crc <br>
XMODEM only. Use 16 bit CRC (normally a one byte checksum is
used). <br>
-C, --allow-remote-commands <br>
allow remote command execution ( insecure ). This allows the
sender to execute an arbitrary command through system () or
execl (). Default is to disable this feature (?). <br>
This option is ignored if running in restricted mode. <br>
-D, --null <br>
Output file data to /dev/null; for testing. (Unix only) <br>
--delay-startup N <br>
Wait N seconds before doing anything. <br>
-e, --escape <br>
Force sender to escape all control characters; normally XON,
XOFF, DLE, CR-@-CR, and Ctrl-X are escaped. <br>
-E, --rename <br>
Rename incoming file if target filename already exists. The
new file name will have a dot and a number (0..999)
appended. <br>
-h, --help <br>
give help screen. <br>
-m N, --min-bps N <br>
Stop transmission if BPS-Rate (Bytes Per Second) falls below
N for a certain time (see --min-bps-time option). <br>
-M N, --min-bps-time <br>
Used together with --min-bps. Default is 120 (seconds). <br>
-O, --disable-timeouts <br>
Disable read timeout handling code. This makes lrz hang if
the sender does not send any more, but increases performance
(a bit) and decreases system load (through reducing <br>
the number of system calls by about 50 percent).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use this option with care. <br>
--o-sync <br>
Open output files in synchronous write mode. This may be
useful if you experience errors due to lost interrupts if
update (or bdflush or whoever this daemon is called on <br>
your system) writes the buffers to the disk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is ignored and a
warning is printed if your systems doesn&rsquo;t support
O_SYNC. <br>
-p, --protect <br>
(ZMODEM) Protect: skip file if destination file exists. <br>
-q, --quiet <br>
Quiet suppresses verbosity. <br>
-r, --resume <br>
Crash recovery mode. lrz tries to resume interrupted file
transfers. <br>
-R, --restricted <br>
Enter more restricted mode. lrz will not create directories
or files with a leading dot if this option is given
twice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See SECURITY for mode
information about restricted mode. <br>
-s HH:MM, --stop-at HH:MM <br>
Stop transmission at HH hours, MM minutes. Another variant,
using +N instead of HH:MM, stops transmission in N seconds.
<br>
-S, --timesync <br>
Request timesync packet from the sender. The sender sends
its system time, causing lrz to complain about more then 60
seconds difference.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Lrz tries to set the local
system time to the remote time if this option is given twice
(this fails if lrz is not run by root).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option makes lrz
incompatible with certain other ZModems. Don&rsquo;t use it
unless you know what you are doing. <br>
--syslog[=off] <br>
turn syslogging on or off. the default is set at configure
time. This option is ignored if no syslog support is
compiled in. <br>
-t TIM, --timeout TIM <br>
Change timeout to TIM tenths of seconds. This is ignored if
timeout handling is turned of through the O option. <br>
--tcp-client ADDRESS:PORT <br>
Act as a tcp/ip client: Connect to the given port.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See --tcp-server for more
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--tcp-server <br>
Act as a server: Open a socket, print out what to do, wait
for connection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You will normally not want to
use this option as lrzsz is the only zmodem which
understands what to do (private extension). You might want
to use this if you have to use <br>
zmodem (for which reason whatever), and cannot use the --tcp
option of lsz (perhaps because your telnet doesn&rsquo;t
allow to spawn a local program with stdin/stdout connected
<br>
to the remote side).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you use this option you have
to start lsz with the --tcp-client ADDRESS:PORT option. lrz
will print the address and port on startup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use of this option imposes a
security risk, somebody else could connect to the port in
between. See SECURITY for details. <br>
-U, --unrestrict <br>
turn off restricted mode (this is not possible if running
under a restricted shell). <br>
--version <br>
prints out version number. <br>
-v, --verbose <br>
Verbose causes a list of file names to be appended to
stderr. More v&rsquo;s generate more output. <br>
-wN, --windowsize N <br>
Set window size to N. <br>
-X, --xmodem <br>
use XMODEM protocol. <br>
-y, --overwrite <br>
Yes, clobber any existing files with the same name. <br>
--ymodem <br>
use YMODEM protocol. <br>
-Z, --zmodem <br>
use ZMODEM protocol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SECURITY <br>
Contrary to the original ZMODEM lrz defaults to restricted
mode. In restricted mode lrz will not accept absolute
pathnames or references to a parent directory, will not
modify an <br>
existing file, and removes any files received in error.
Remote command execution is disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To use a more restricted mode
set the environment variable ZMODEM_RESTRICTED or give the R
option. This disables creation of subdirectories and
invisible files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Restricted mode may be turned
off with the U option, unless lrz runs under a restricted
shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use of the <br>
--tcp-client or --tcp-server options imposes a security
risk, as somebody else could connect to the port before you
do it, and grab your data. If there&rsquo;s strong demand
for <br>
a more secure mode i might introduce some sort of password
challenge.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
lrz uses the following environment variables:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SHELL lrz recognizes a
restricted shell if this variable includes rsh or rksh</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ZMODEM_RESTRICTED <br>
lrz enters the more restricted mode if the variable is
set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
(Pro-YAM command) <br>
&lt;ALT-2&gt; <br>
Pro-YAM Command: sz *.h *.c <br>
(This automatically invokes rz on the connected system.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Compile time options required
for various operating systems are described in the source
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
Sending serial data to timesharing minicomputers at
sustained high speeds has been known to cause lockups,
system halts, kernel panics, and occasional antisocial
behaviour. When <br>
experimenting with high speed input to a system, consider
rebooting the system if the file transfers are not
successful, especially if the personality of the system
appears <br>
altered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Unix &quot;ulimit&quot;
parameter must be set high enough to permit large file
transfers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The TTY input buffering on some
systems may not allow long blocks or streaming input at high
speed. You should suspect this problem when you can&rsquo;t
send data to the Unix system <br>
at high speeds using ZMODEM, YMODEM-1k or XMODEM-1k, when
YMODEM with 128 byte blocks works properly. If the
system&rsquo;s tty line handling is really broken, the
serial port or the <br>
entire system may not survive the onslaught of long bursts
of high speed data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The DSZ or Pro-YAM zmodem l
numeric parameter may be set to a value between 64 and 1024
to limit the burst length (&quot;zmodem pl128&quot;).</p>

Brown. Directory creation code from John Gilmore&rsquo;s PD
TAR program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Calling rz from most versions of cu(1) doesn&rsquo;t work
because cu&rsquo;s receive process fights rz for characters
from the modem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Programs that do not properly
implement the specified file transfer protocol may cause sz
to &quot;hang&quot; the port for a minute or two. Every
reported instance of this problem has <br>
been corrected by using ZCOMM, Pro-YAM, or other program
with a correct implementation of the specified protocol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Many programs claiming to
support YMODEM only support XMODEM with 1k blocks, and they
often don&rsquo;t get that quite right.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pathnames are restricted to 127
characters. In XMODEM single file mode, the pathname given
on the command line is still processed as described above.
The ASCII option&Acirc;&acute;s CR/LF <br>
to NL translation merely deletes CR&Acirc;&acute;s;
undos(omen) performs a more intelligent translation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VMS VERSION <br>
The VMS version does not set the file time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VMS C Standard I/O and RMS may
interact to modify file contents unexpectedly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The VMS version does not support
invocation as rzCOMMAND . The current VMS version does not
support XMODEM, XMODEM-1k, or YMODEM.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">According to the VMS
documentation, the buffered input routine used on the VMS
version of rz introduces a delay of up to one second for
each protocol transaction. This delay may <br>
be significant for very short files. Removing the
&quot;#define BUFREAD&quot; line from rz.c will eliminate
this delay at the expense of increased CPU utilization.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The VMS version causes DCL to
generate a random off the wall error message under some
error conditions; this is a result of the incompatibility of
the VMS &quot;exit&quot; function with <br>
the Unix/MSDOS standard.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ZMODEM CAPABILITIES <br>
Rz supports incoming ZMODEM binary (-b), ASCII (-a), protect
(-p), clobber (-y), and append (-+) requests. The default is
protect (-p) and binary (-b).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Unix versions support ZMODEM
command execution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
rz.c, crctab.c, rbsb.c, zm.c, zmodem.h Unix source
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rz.c, crctab.c, vrzsz.c, zm.c,
