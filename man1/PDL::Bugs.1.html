PDL::Bugs - How to diagnose and report PDL problems
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="VERSION"><a class="selflink" href="#VERSION">VERSION</a></h1>
version 1.0000
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
This module explains how to get help with a PDL problem and how, when, and where
  to submit a bug report. In the future it may be extended to provide some sort
  of automated bug reporting capability.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="IF_YOU_HAVE_A_PDL_PROBLEM"><a class="selflink" href="#IF_YOU_HAVE_A_PDL_PROBLEM">IF
  YOU HAVE A PDL PROBLEM</a></h1>
The primary resource for support for the Perl Data Language is via the PDL
  mailing lists. The pdl-general list is for general use and discussions and is
  the one to use for questions about problems with PDL or PDL use for
  computation. This <i>is almost always</i> the list to post to for PDL
  problems.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The pdl-devel list is <i>specifically</i> for PDL development and often contains
  discussions of a rather technical nature relating to PDL internals. This is
  <i>not</i> the list for general PDL discussion or questions.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   http://pdl.perl.org/?page=mailing-lists
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>NOTE</b>: Both pdl-general and pdl-devel are read by the PDL developers so
  you don't save time or increase the probability of response by posting to
  pdl-devel or by cross-posting to pdl-devel. Please stick to pdl-general list
  posts unless you want to talk PDL implementation and development.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>NOTE</b>: There is also a PDL IRC channel which can be useful for immediate
  questions if populated. However, it has the big disadvantage of not being
  easily searched or routinely read by all PDL developers and users. As a
  result, if you get an answer there, it may be incorrect or incomplete
  depending on who happens to be chatting at the time. It is definitely not
  readily searchable.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="REPORTING_BUGS"><a class="selflink" href="#REPORTING_BUGS">REPORTING
  BUGS</a></h1>
Please submit bug reports via the sourceforge bug tracker interface at
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   http://sourceforge.net/p/pdl/bugs/
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
where you can review the previously submitted bug reports. Click on &quot;Create
  Ticket&quot; to generate a bug report. If you do not already have a
  sourceforge.net account, you will need to get one to submit the report:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   http://sourceforge.net/account/registration/
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Please provide a way for the PDL developers to contact you regarding the
  problem.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Try to include any information you think might help someone isolate, reproduce,
  and fix your problem.
<div class="Pp"></div>
At a <i>minimum</i>, include the following information:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">PDL version number (e.g. PDL-2.007)</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Perl version information. Output from &quot;perl -v&quot;
      or &quot;perl -V&quot; (even better!)</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Your operating System. You can run the &quot;uname -a&quot;
      command on many unix systems</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The full output of &quot;perldl -V&quot;
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If you are reporting a bug with an already installed PDL. If the PDL has
      compiled and built but not been installed, you may run &quot;perl -Mblib
      perldl -V&quot; from the top level of the PDL build directory.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The bug description and how to reproduce it.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Short examples using the PDL shells, &quot;pdl2&quot; or &quot;perldl&quot;,
      are excellent! Don't forget to include needed input data (as small as
      possible) so that the code can be run with a cut and paste.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Other things that are often helpful:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Details about your operating environment that might be
      related to the problem</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Exact cut and pasted error or warning messages</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The shortest, clearest code you can manage to write which
      reproduces the bug described.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">A patch against the latest released version of this
      distribution which fixes this bug.</dd>

  output of &quot;perldl -V&quot;) to

BEFORE you report a bug make sure you got the latest release version of PDL,
  always available from CPAN, check

and the mailing list archives for hints. You can find links to the searchable
  archives at
<div class="Pp"></div>

Patches can be sent to the pdl-devel mailing list (see above) or can be directly
  submitted to the patch manager
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>

<div class="Pp"></div>
Patches should be made against the latest released PDL or, ideally, against the
