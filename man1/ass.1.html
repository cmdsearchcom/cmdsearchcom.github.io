<p>ASS(1) General Commands Manual ASS(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ass - autonomous system scanner</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ass [-v[v[v]]] -i &lt;interface&gt; [-p] [-c] [-A] [-M] [-P
IER12] -a &lt;autonomous system start&gt; -b &lt;autonomous
system stop&gt; [-S &lt;spoofed source IP&gt;] [-D
&lt;destination ip&gt;] [-T &lt;packets <br>
per delay&gt;]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This manual page documents briefly the ass command. This
manual page was written for the Debian distribution because
the original program does not have a manual page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ASS, the autonomous system
scanner, is designed to find the AS of the router. It
supports the following protocols: IRDP, IGRP, EIGRP, RIPv1,
RIPv2, CDP, HSRP and OSPF.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In passive mode (./ass -i eth0),
it just listens to routing protocol packets (like broadcast
and multicast hellos).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In active mode (./ass -i eth0
-A), it tries to discover routers by asking for information.
This is done to the appropriate address for each protocol
(either broadcast or multi&acirc; <br>
cast addresses). If you specify a destination address, this
will be used but may be not as effective as the
defaults.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EIGRP scanning is done
differently: While scanning, ASS listens for HELLO packets
and then scans the AS directly on the router who advertised
himself. You can force EIGRP scan&acirc; <br>
ning into the same AS-Scan behavior as IGRP uses by giving a
destination or into multicast scanning by the option -M.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For Active mode, you can select
the protocols you want to scan for. If you don&rsquo;t
select them, all are scanned. You select protcols by giving
the option -P and any combination of <br>
the following chars: IER12, where:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">I = IGRP</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">E = EIGRP</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">R = IRDP</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 = RIPv1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 = RIPv2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ASS output might look a little
strange, but has it&rsquo;s meanings:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Routers are identified by the
sender&rsquo;s IP address of the packet. This may lead to
several routers showing up as more then one since they used
different sender interfaces. In the <br>
brackets, the protocols this router runs are shown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Routing protocols are shown as
one or more indented lines. First, there is the routing
protocol name (like EIGRP), followed by the autonomous
system number in brackets. Aligned <br>
to the right is the target network if applicable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IGRP routing info shows the
target network and in brackets the following values: Delay,
Bandwidth, MTU, Reliability, Load and Hopcount.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The IRDP info is limmited to the
announced gateway (router) and it&rsquo;s preference</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RIPv1 info just gives you the
classified target network (remember RIPv1 network
boundaries) and it&rsquo;s metric</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RIPv2 info contains after the
target network the following infos: Netmask, next hop,
arbitrary tag, and the metric. An additional line may appear
on the routers section that <br>
gives you the authentication if enabled in the protocol. For
text auth, the password is there.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The basic EIGRP just gives you
the autonomous system number, the IOS and EIGRP version as
found in the HELLO packet</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The EIGRP routes section depends
on the type of route. All of them include the fields
destination network, destination mask and in the last line
(in brackets) the values for <br>
Delay, Bandwidth, MTU, Reliability, Load and Hopcount.
External routes also include the originating router, the
originating autonomous system, the external metric and the
source <br>
of this route.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HSRP info is not routing,
therefore the third field is the virtual IP address of the
standby group, followed by the state, the auth string,
Hello, Hold and priority values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OSPF info includes the
destination network as well as the Area in IP format, the
authentication used (and, if applicable the auth string),
netmask, designated and backup router <br>
and the values for Dead, Priority and Hello.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
A summary of options is included below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Show summary of options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i &lt;interface&gt; <br>
interface</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v verbose mode</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A Active mode scanning</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P &lt;protocols&gt; <br>
Select protocols to scan</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M EIGRP systems are scanned
using the multicast address and not by HELLO enumeration and
direct query</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a &lt;autonomous system&gt;
<br>
autonomous system to start from</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b &lt;autonomous system&gt;
<br>
autonomous system to stop with</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S &lt;spoofed source IP&gt;
<br>
maybe you need this</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D &lt;destination IP&gt; <br>
If you don&rsquo;t specify this, the appropriate address per
protocol is used</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p don&rsquo;t run in
promiscuous mode (bad idea)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c terminate after scanning.
This is not recommened since answers may arrive later and
you could see some traffic that did not show up during your
scans</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T &lt;packets per delay&gt;
<br>
how many packets should we wait some milliseconds (-T 1 is
the slowest scan -T 100 begins to become unreliable)</p>
