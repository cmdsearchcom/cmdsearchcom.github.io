This manual page documents briefly the <b>ass</b> command. This manual page was
  written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have
  a manual page.
<div class="Pp"></div>
ASS, the autonomous system scanner, is designed to find the AS of the router. It
  supports the following protocols: IRDP, IGRP, EIGRP, RIPv1, RIPv2, CDP, HSRP
  and OSPF.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In passive mode (./ass -i eth0), it just listens to routing protocol packets
  (like broadcast and multicast hellos).
<div class="Pp"></div>
In active mode (./ass -i eth0 -A), it tries to discover routers by asking for
  information. This is done to the appropriate address for each protocol (either
  broadcast or multicast addresses). If you specify a destination address, this
  will be used but may be not as effective as the defaults.
<div class="Pp"></div>
EIGRP scanning is done differently: While scanning, ASS listens for HELLO
  packets and then scans the AS directly on the router who advertised himself.
  You can force EIGRP scanning into the same AS-Scan behavior as IGRP uses by
  giving a destination or into multicast scanning by the option -M.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For Active mode, you can select the protocols you want to scan for. If you don't
  select them, all are scanned. You select protcols by giving the option -P and
  any combination of the following chars: IER12, where:
<div class="Pp"></div>
I = IGRP
<div class="Pp"></div>
E = EIGRP
<div class="Pp"></div>
R = IRDP
<div class="Pp"></div>
1 = RIPv1
<div class="Pp"></div>
2 = RIPv2
<div class="Pp"></div>
ASS output might look a little strange, but has it's meanings:
<div class="Pp"></div>
Routers are identified by the sender's IP address of the packet. This may lead
  to several routers showing up as more then one since they used different
  sender interfaces. In the brackets, the protocols this router runs are shown.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Routing protocols are shown as one or more indented lines. First, there is the
  routing protocol name (like EIGRP), followed by the autonomous system number
  in brackets. Aligned to the right is the target network if applicable.
<div class="Pp"></div>
IGRP routing info shows the target network and in brackets the following values:
  Delay, Bandwidth, MTU, Reliability, Load and Hopcount.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The IRDP info is limmited to the announced gateway (router) and it's preference
<div class="Pp"></div>
RIPv1 info just gives you the classified target network (remember RIPv1 network
  boundaries) and it's metric
<div class="Pp"></div>
RIPv2 info contains after the target network the following infos: Netmask, next
  hop, arbitrary tag, and the metric. An additional line may appear on the
  routers section that gives you the authentication if enabled in the protocol.
  For text auth, the password is there.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The basic EIGRP just gives you the autonomous system number, the IOS and EIGRP
  version as found in the HELLO packet
<div class="Pp"></div>
The EIGRP routes section depends on the type of route. All of them include the
  fields destination network, destination mask and in the last line (in
  brackets) the values for Delay, Bandwidth, MTU, Reliability, Load and
  Hopcount. External routes also include the originating router, the originating
  autonomous system, the external metric and the source of this route.
<div class="Pp"></div>
HSRP info is not routing, therefore the third field is the virtual IP address of
  the standby group, followed by the state, the auth string, Hello, Hold and
  priority values.
<div class="Pp"></div>
OSPF info includes the destination network as well as the Area in IP format, the
  authentication used (and, if applicable the auth string), netmask, designated
  and backup router and the values for Dead, Priority and Hello.
