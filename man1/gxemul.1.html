<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
gxemul &acirc; an experimental framework for full-system
machine emulation</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
gxemul [options] -e name [additional components and files
...] <br>

gxemul -V <br>
gxemul -H</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS (LEGACY) <br>
gxemul [machine, other, and general options] [file ...] <br>
gxemul [general options] @configfile</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
gxemul is a framework for full-system computer architecture
emulation. Several processor architectures and machine types
have been implemented. It is working well enough to allow
<br>
unmodified &quot;guest&quot; operating systems (e.g. NetBSD)
to run inside the emulator, as if they were running on real
hardware.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The emulator emulates (networks
of) real machines. The machines may consist of ARM, MIPS,
Motorola 88K, PowerPC, and SuperH processors, and various
surrounding hardware components <br>
such as framebuffers, busses, interrupt controllers,
ethernet controllers, disk controllers, and serial port
controllers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: Only very few emulated
machine modes have been rewritten to use the new emulation
framework introduced in version 0.6.x, so there are two
different ways to use the emulator. <br>
(Most emulation modes and machines are only valid in the old
framework.) The options available for the new framework
are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B Enables snapshotting
(required for reverse execution/stepping).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e name <br>
Start with a machine based on template &rsquo;name&rsquo;.
The name may be followed by optional arguments in
parentheses, e.g.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gxemul -V -e
&rsquo;testmips(cpu=R4400)&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Remember to use quotes if your
shell gives special meaning to parentheses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H Display a list of available
machine templates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Start up in Quiet mode (i.e.
suppress debug messages). If an error occurs during
emulation which stops execution and drops the user into the
debugger, quiet mode is turned <br>
off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Start up in interactive mode,
paused. If this option is used, -q is ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When using the -e option, the
remainder of the command line consists of zero or more
additional files to load, or components to add to the
emulation setup. Including these on the <br>
command line is equivalent to using the &rsquo;add&rsquo;
command (although with a different syntax) in the
interactive debugger. A simple example is a file name to
load into the emulated <br>
machine, but they can be more complex as well. See the
Adding Additional Components on the Command Line section
below for more details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When not using the -e option,
the config file should be one that was previously saved from
within the emulator using the &rsquo;save&rsquo;
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Starting the emulator with the
-V switch will bring you to the interactive debugger
environment, without starting the emulation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ADDING ADDITIONAL COMPONENTS ON
THE COMMAND LINE <br>
The general syntax is:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">existing_component_path:component(args)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If existing_component_path part
is omitted, it is assumed to be cpu0. The component(args)
part may be written as just args, in which case the name of
the component is autode&acirc; <br>
tected, and the args is given as an argument called
&quot;name&quot; to that component.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gxemul For example, if the
additional component/filename is just</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">netbsd-GENERIC</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">this will be equivalent to</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">cpu0:file(name=netbsd-GENERIC)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An attempt will be made to load
the file netbsd-GENERIC into cpu0, which is the default
component if none is specified. This will most likely be
expanded into root.machine0.main&acirc; <br>
bus0.cpu0. If cpu0 is ambiguous, then this will not work;
the specific cpu0 name must be supplied instead, like
this:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">machine3.mainbus0.cpu0:netbsd-GENERIC</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another example, using an SDL
display component to show the contents of an emulated video
framebuffer:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fb_videoram0:sdl()</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here, the existing component
name (the framebuffer) and the component to add (the SDL
display component) are included, but no arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RUNNING GUEST OPERATING SYSTEMS
<br>
Please read the HTML documentation for more details on how
to run complete guest operating systems in the emulator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION (LEGACY) <br>
The emulator can be invoked in the following ways:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. When emulating a complete
machine, configuration options can be supplied directly on
the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Options can be read from a
configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The easiest way to use the
emulator is to supply settings directly on the command
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The most important thing you
need to supply is the file argument. This is the name of a
binary file (an ELF, a.out, COFF/ECOFF, SREC, or a raw
binary image) which you wish to run <br>
in the emulator. This file might be an operating system
kernel, or perhaps a ROM image file. If more than one
filename is supplied, all files are loaded into memory, and
the entry <br>
point (if available) is taken from the last file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Apart from the name of a binary
file, you must also use the -E and/or -e options to select
which emulation mode to use. This is necessary because the
emulator cannot in general <br>
deduce this from the file being executed. For example, a
MIPS-based machine from DEC (a DECstation) is very different
from a MIPS-based machine from SGI. Use gxemul -H to get a
<br>
list of available emulation modes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are three exceptions to
the normal invocation usage mentioned above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. For DECstation emulation, if
you have a bootable DECstation harddisk or CDROM image, then
just supplying the diskimage via the -d option is
sufficient. The filename of the ker&acirc; <br>
nel can then be skipped, as the emulator runs the bootblocks
from the diskimage directly and doesn&rsquo;t need the
kernel as a separate file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. If you supply an ISO9660
CDROM disk image, then using the -j option to indicate a
file on the CDROM filesystem to load is sufficient; no
additional kernel filename needs to be <br>
supplied on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. For Dreamcast emulation, when
booting e.g. a NetBSD/dreamcast CDROM image, it is enough to
supply the disk image (with the correct ISO partition start
offset). Bootblocks will <br>
be read directly from the CDROM image, and there is no need
to supply the name of an external kernel on the command
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Gzipped kernels are
automatically unzipped, by calling the external gunzip
program, both when specifying a gzipped file directly on the
command line and when loading such a file <br>
using the -j option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Machine selection options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E t Try to emulate machine type
t. This option is not always needed, if the -e option
uniquely selects a machine. (Use -H to get a list of
types.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e st Try to emulate machine
subtype st. Use this together with -E. (This option is not
always needed, if a machine type has no subtypes.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C x Try to emulate a specific
CPU type, x. This overrides the default CPU type for the
machine being emulated. (Use -H to get a list of available
CPU types.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d [modifiers:]filename <br>
Add filename as a disk image. By adding one or more modifier
characters and then a colon (&quot;:&quot;) as a prefix to
filename, you can modify the way the disk image is treated.
<br>
Available modifiers are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">b Specifies that this is a boot
device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c CD-ROM.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">d DISK (this is the
default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f FLOPPY.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gH;S; Override the default
geometry; use H heads and S sectors-per-track. (The number
of cylinders is calculated automatically.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">i IDE. (This is the default for
most machine types.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">oOFS; Set the base offset for an
ISO9660 filesystem on a disk image. The default is 0. A
suitable offset when booting from Dreamcast ISO9660
filesystem images, which are <br>
offset by 11702 sectors, is 23965696.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">r Read-only (don&rsquo;t allow
changes to be written to the file).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">s SCSI.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">t Tape.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">V Add an overlay filename to an
already defined disk image. (A ID number must also be
specified when this flag is used. See the documentation for
an example of how <br>
to use overlays.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0-7 Force a specific ID
number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For SCSI devices, the ID number
is the SCSI ID. For IDE harddisks, the ID number has the
following meaning:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 Primary master.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 Primary slave.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 Secondary master.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3 Secondary slave.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unless otherwise specified,
filenames ending with &quot;.iso&quot; or &quot;.cdr&quot;
are assumed to be CDROM images. Most others are assumed to
be disks. Depending on which machine is being <br>
emulated, the default for disks can be either SCSI or IDE.
Some disk images that are very small are assumed to be
floppy disks. (If you are not happy with the way a disk <br>
image is detected, then you need to use explicit prefixes to
force a specific type.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For floppies, the gH;S; prefix
is ignored. Instead, the number of heads and cylinders are
assumed to be 2 and 80, respectively, and the number of
sectors per track is cal&acirc; <br>
culated automatically. (This works for 720KB, 1.2MB, 1.44MB,
and 2.88MB floppies.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I hz Set the main CPU&rsquo;s
frequency to hz Hz. This option does not work for all
emulated machine modes. It affects the way count/compare
interrupts are faked to simulate emulated <br>
time = real world time. If the guest operating system relies
on RTC interrupts instead of count/compare interrupts, then
this option has no effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Setting the frequency to zero
disables automatic synchronization of emulated time vs real
world time, and the count/compare system runs at a fixed
rate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i Enable instruction trace,
i.e. display disassembly of each instruction as it is being
executed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-J Disable instruction
combinations in the dynamic translator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-j n Set the name of the kernel
to n. When booting from an ISO9660 filesystem, the emulator
will try to boot using this file. (In some emulation modes,
eg. DECstation, this <br>
name is passed along to the boot program. Useful names are
&quot;bsd&quot; for OpenBSD/pmax, &quot;vmunix&quot; for
Ultrix, or &quot;vmsprite&quot; for Sprite.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M m Emulate m MBs of physical
RAM. This overrides the default amount of RAM for the
selected machine type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N Display the number of
executed instructions per second on average, at regular
intervals.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n nr Set the number of
processors in the machine, for SMP experiments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note 1: The emulator allocates
quite a lot of virtual memory for per-CPU translation
tables. On 64-bit hosts, this is normally not a problem. On
32-bit hosts, this can use <br>
up all available virtual userspace memory. The solution is
to either run the emulator on a 64-bit host, or limit the
number of emulated CPUs to a reasonably low number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note 2: SMP simulation is not
working very well yet; multiple processors are simulated,
but synchronization between the processors does not map very
well to how real-world <br>
SMP systems work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O Force a &quot;netboot&quot;
(tftp instead of disk), even when a disk image is present
(for DECstation, SGI, and ARC emulation).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o arg Set the boot argument
(mostly useful for DEC, ARC, or SGI emulation). Default arg
for DEC is &quot;-a&quot;, for ARC/SGI it is
&quot;-aN&quot;, and for CATS it is &quot;-A&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p pc Add a breakpoint. pc can
be a symbol, or a numeric value. (Remember to use the
&quot;0x&quot; prefix for hexadecimal values.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Q Disable the built-in
(software-only) PROM emulation. This option is useful for
experimenting with running raw ROM images from real
machines. The default behaviour of the <br>
emulator is to &quot;fake&quot; certain PROM calls used by
guest operating systems (e.g. NetBSD), so that no real PROM
image is needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R Use a random bootstrap cpu,
instead of CPU nr 0. (This option is only meaningful
together with the -n option.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Dump register contents for
every executed instruction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S Initialize emulated RAM to
random data, instead of zeroes. This option is useful when
trying to trigger bugs in a program that occur because the
program assumed that unini&acirc; <br>
tialized memory contains zeros. (Use with care.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s flags:filename <br>
Gather statistics based on the current emulated program
counter value, while the program executes. The statistics is
actually just a raw dump of all program counter values <br>
in sequence, suitable for post-analysis with separate tools.
Output is appended to filename.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The flags should include one or
more of the following type specifiers:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">v Virtual. This means that the
program counter value is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">p Physical. This means that the
physical address of where the program is actually running is
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">i Instruction call. This type of
statistics gathering is practically only useful during
development of the emulator itself. The output is a list of
addresses of <br>
instruction call functions (ic-&gt;f), which after some
post-processing can be used as a basis for deciding when to
implement instruction combinations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The flags may also include the
following optional modifiers:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">d Disabled at startup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Overwrite the file, instead of
appending to it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Statistics gathering can be
enabled/disabled at runtime by using the
&quot;statistics_enabled = yes&quot; and
&quot;statistics_enabled = no&quot; debugger commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When gathering instruction
statistics using the -s option, instruction combinations are
always disabled (i.e. an implicit -J flag is added to the
command line).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T Halt if the emulated program
attempts to access non-existing memory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Show a trace tree of all
function calls being made.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U Enable
slow_serial_interrupts_hack_for_linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X Use X11. This option enables
graphical framebuffers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x Open up new xterms for
emulated serial ports. The default behaviour is to open up
xterms when using configuration files, or if X11 is enabled.
When starting up a simple <br>
emulation session with settings directly on the command
line, and neither -X nor -x is used, then all output is
confined to the terminal that gxemul started in.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Y n Scale down framebuffer
windows by n x n times. This option is useful when emulating
a very large framebuffer, and the actual display is of lower
resolution. If n is nega&acirc; <br>
tive, then there will be no scaledown, but emulation of
certain graphic controllers will be scaled up by -n times
instead. E.g. Using -2 with VGA text mode emulation will
<br>
result in 80x25 character cells rendered in a 1280x800
window, instead of the normal resolution of 640x400.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Z n Set the number of graphics
cards, for emulating a dual-head or tripple-head
environment. (Only for DECstation emulation so far.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z disp <br>
Add disp as an X11 display to use for framebuffers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">General options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c cmd Add cmd as a command to
run before starting the simulation. A similar effect can be
achieved by using the -V option, and entering the commands
manually.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D Causes the emulator to skip a
call to srandom(). This leads to somewhat more deterministic
behaviour than running without this option. However, if the
emulated machine has <br>
clocks or timer interrupt sources, or if user interaction is
taking place (e.g. keyboard input at irregular intervals),
then this option is meaningless.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H Display a list of available
CPU types and machine types. (Most of these don&rsquo;t
work. Please read the HTML documentation included in the
gxemul distribution for details on <br>
which modes that actually work.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Display a list of all
available command line options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k n Set the size of the
dyntrans cache (per emulated CPU) to n MB. The default size
is 48 MB.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-K Force the single-step
debugger to be entered at the end of a simulation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Quiet mode; this suppresses
startup messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Start up in the single-step
debugger, paused. If this option is used, -q is ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Increase verbosity (show more
debug messages). This option can be used multiple times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Configuration file startup:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@ configfile <br>
Start an emulation based on the contents of configfile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For more information, please
read the HTML documentation in the doc/ subdirectory of the
gxemul distribution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LEGACY EXAMPLES <br>
The following command will start NetBSD/pmax on an emulated
DECstation 5000/200 (3MAX):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gxemul -e 3max -d
nbsd_pmax.img</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nbsd_pmax.img should be a raw
disk image containing a bootable NetBSD/pmax filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following command will start
an emulation session based on settings in the configuration
file &quot;mysession&quot;. The -v option tells gxemul to be
verbose.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gxemul -v @mysession</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you have compiled the small
Hello World program mentioned in the gxemul documentation,
the following command will start up an emulated test machine
in &quot;paused&quot; mode:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gxemul -E testmips -V
hello_mips</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Paused mode means that you enter
the interactive single-step debugger directly at startup,
instead of launching the Hello World program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The paused mode is also what
should be used when running &quot;unknown&quot; files for
the first time in the emulator. E.g. if you have a binary
which you think is some kind of MIPS ROM <br>
image, then you can try the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gxemul -vv -E baremips -V
0xbfc00000:image.raw</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can then use the
single-stepping functionality of the built-in debugger to
run the code in the ROM image, to see how it behaves. Based
on that, you can deduce what machine type <br>
it was actually from (the baremips machine is not a real
machine), and perhaps try again with another emulation
mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In general, however, real ROM
images require much more emulation detail than GXemul
provides, so they can usually not run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please read the HTML
documentation for more details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
There are many bugs. Some of the known bugs are mentioned in
the TODO file in the gxemul source distribution, some are
marked as TODO in the source code itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most emulation modes are LEGACY
modes, which have not yet been rewritten to use the new
framework. The documentation is most likely buggy, in the
sense that it describes things <br>
from the old framework when the new one applies, and/or vice
versa.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gxemul is in general not
cycle-accurate; it does not simulate individual pipe-line
stages or penalties caused by branch-prediction misses or
cache misses, so it cannot be used for <br>
accurate simulation of any actual real-world processor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gxemul is in general not
timing-accurate. Many emulation modes try to make the guest
operating system&rsquo;s clock run at the same speed as the
host clock. However, the number of <br>
instructions executed per clock tick can obviously vary,
depending on the current CPU load on the host.</p>
