This man page is not a complete set of documentation - the complexity of the
  atlc project makes man pages not an ideal way to document it, although out of
  completeness, man pages are produced. The best documentation that was current
  at the time the version was produced should be found on your hard drive,
  usually at
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
/usr/local/share/atlc/docs/html-docs/index.html
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
although it might be elsewhere if your system administrator chose to install the
  package elsewhere. Sometimes, errors are corrected in the documentation and
  placed at http://atlc.sourceforge.net/ before a new release of atlc is
  released. Please, if you notice a problem with the documentation - even
  spelling errors and typos, please let me know.

<b>create_bmp_for_circ_in_circ</b> is a pre-processor for <b>atlc</b>, the
  finite difference program that is used to calculate the properties of a two
  and three conductor electrical transmission line of arbitrary cross section.
  The program <b>create_bmp_for_circ_in_circ</b> is used as a fast way of
  generating bitmaps (there is no need to use a graphics program), for a
  circular conductor inside a circular conductor (coaxial conductors), like
  this:

The parameter 'D' is the inner dimensions of the outer conductor and 'd' is the
  outer diameter of the inner conductor. The inner conductor is offset 'h' from
  the centre of the outer conductor. The whole region is surrounded by a
  dielectric of relative permittivity 'Er'.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The bitmap is printed to 'outfile.bmp' - the last command line argument.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The bitmaps produced by <b>create_bmp_for_circ_in_circ</b> are 24-bit bit colour
  bitmaps, as are required by <b>atlc</b>.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The permittivities of the dielectric 'Er' determines the colours in the bitmap.
  If Er is 1.0, 1.006, 2.1, 2.2, 2.33, 2.5, 3.3, 3.335, 3,7, 4.8, 10.2 or 100,
  then the colour corresponding to that permittivity will be set according to
  the colours defined in COLOURS below. If Er is not one of those
  permittivities, the region of permittivity Er will be set to the colour
  0xCAFF00. The program <b>atlc</b> does not know what this permittivity is, so
  <b>atlc</b>, must be told with the command line option -d, as in example 4
  below.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
<b>-b bitmapsize</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
is used to set the size of the bitmap, and so the accuracy to which atlc is able
  to calculate the transmission line's properties. The default value for
  'bitmapsize' is normally 4, although this is set at compile time. The value
  can be set anywhere from 1 to 15, but more than 8 is probably not sensible.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-f outfile</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
Set the output filename. By default, the bitmap is sent to stdout, but it *must*
  be sent to a file, with this option, or as described above.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-v </b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
Causes <b>create_bmp_for_circ_in_circ</b> to print some data to stderr. Note,
  nothing extra goes to standard output, as that is expected to be redirected to
  a bitmap file.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="COLOURS"><a class="selflink" href="#COLOURS">COLOURS</a></h1>
The 24-bit bitmaps that <b>atlc</b> expects, have 8 bits assigned to represent
  the amount of red, 8 for blue and 8 for green. Hence there are 256 levels of
  red, green and blue, making a total of 256*256*256=16777216 colours. Every one
  of the possible 16777216 colours can be defined precisely by the stating the
  exact amount of red, green and blue, as in:
<div class="Pp"></div>
red = 255,000,000 or 0xff0000
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
green = 000,255,000 or 0x00ff00
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
blue = 000,000,255 or 0x0000ff
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
black = 000,000,000 or 0x000000
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
white = 255,255,255 or 0xffffff
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
Brown = 255,000,255 or 0xff00ff
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
gray = 142,142,142 or 0x8e8e8e
<div class="Pp"></div>
Some colours, such as pink, turquoise, sandy, brown, gray etc may mean slightly
  different things to different people. This is not so with <b>atlc</b>, as the
  program expects the colours below to be EXACTLY defined as given. Whether you
  feel the colour is sandy or yellow is up to you, but if you use it in your
  bitmap, then it either needs to be a colour reconised by atlc, <b>or</b> you
  must define it with a command line option (see OPTIONS and example 5 below).
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
The following conductors are reconised by atlc:
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
red = 255,000,000 or 0xff0000 is the live conductor.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
green = 000,255,000 or 0x00ff00 is the grounded conductor.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
blue = 000,000,000 or 0x000000 is the negative conductor
<div class="Pp"></div>
All bitmaps <b>must</b> have the live (red) and grounded (green) conductor. The
  blue conductor is not currently supported, but it will be used to indicate a
  negative conductor, which will be needed if/when the program gets extended to
  analyse directional couplers.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The following dielectrics are reconised by atlc <b> and so are</b> <b>produced
  by </b>create_bmp_for_circ_in_circ <b>.</b>

white 255,255,255 or 0xFFFFFF as Er=1.0 (vacuum)

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="NOTE"><a class="selflink" href="#NOTE">NOTE</a></h1>
Although <b>create_bmp_for_circ_in_circ</b> is used for circular inner and outer
  conductors, the outside of the outer conductor is drawn as a square. This is
  for convenience and makes no difference to the calculations. The inside is of
  the outer conductor is drawn as a circle.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="EXAMPLES"><a class="selflink" href="#EXAMPLES">EXAMPLES</a></h1>
Here are a few examples of the use of <b>create_bmp_for_circ_in_circ</b>. Again,
  see the html documentation in atlc-X.Y.Z/docs/html-docs/index.html for more
  examples.
<div class="Pp"></div>
1) In the first example, the outer conductor has an inside diameter of 12 units
  (inches, mm, feet etc.), the inner has an outside diameter of 3.9 units. The
  inner is placed centrally (h=0) and the dielectric is vacuum (Er=1.0).
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>% create_bmp_for_circ_in_circ 12 3.9 0 1.0 coaxial_1.bmp</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
% atlc coaxial_1.bmp
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>atlc</b> will indicate the correct value of impedance to be 67.3667 Ohms,
  whereas an exact analysis will show the true value to be 67.4358 Ohms, so
  <b>atlc</b> has an error of 0.102%.
<div class="Pp"></div>
2) In this second example, the conductor sizes are the sames as in example 1,
  but the inner is located 3.5 units off-centre and the dielectric has a
  relative permittivity of 2.1 (Er of PTFE) The output is sent to a file
  not_in_centre.bmp which is then processed by <b>atlc</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>% create_bmp_for_circ_in_circ 12 3.9 3.5 2.1 not_in_centre.bmp</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>% atlc not_in_centre.bmp</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
The impedance of this is theoretically 24.315342 Ohms, as
  create_bmp_for_circ_in_circ will calculate for you. atlc's estimate is 24.2493
  Ohms, an error of only -0.271 %.
<div class="Pp"></div>
3) In the third example the bitmap is made larger, to increase accuracy, but
  otherwise this is identical to the previous one.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>% create_bmp_for_circ_in_circ -b8 12 3.9 3.5 2.1 bigger_not_in_centre.bmp
  </b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>% atlc bigger_not_in_centre.bmp</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
This time atlc will take much longer to calculate Zo, since the bitmap is larger
  and so it needs to do more calculations. However, the final result should be
  more accurate. In this case, the result reported is 24.2461 Ohms, an error
  that's marginally smaller than before at 0.285 %. It is possible there may be
  something to be gained by decreasing the cutoff at larger grids, so this is
  being investigated. However, errors almost always below 0.25 %, no matter what
  is being analysed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In the fourth example, a material with a relativity permittivity 7.89 of is
  used. There is no change in how to use <b>create_bmp_for_circ_in_circ</b>, but
  since this permittivity is not one of the pre-defined values (see COLOURS), we
  must tell <b>atlc</b> what it is. The colour will be set an olive green one,
  with a hexacidcal representation of red=0xCA, blue=OxFF and green = 0x00. This
  just happens to be the default colour used when the permittivity is unknown.
  So atlc must be given this information, like thisL
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>% create_bmp_for_circ_in_circ 23 9 0 7.89 an_odd_er.bmp</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
% atlc -d CAFF00=7.89 an_odd_er.bmp This has a theoretical impedance of
  20.041970 Ohms, but atlc version 3.0.1 will calculate it to be 20.0300, an
  error of -0.058 % !!! If you look at the file an_odd_er.bmp with a graphics
  package, you will see there are 3 colours in it - the red inner conductor, the
  green outer and an olive-green dielectric.
