create_bmp_for_circ_in_circ - bitmap generator for circular

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WARNING <br>
This man page is not a complete set of documentation - the
complexity of the atlc project makes man pages not an ideal
way to document it, although out of completeness, man pages
<br>
are produced. The best documentation that was current at the
time the version was produced should be found on your hard
drive, usually at <br>
/usr/local/share/atlc/docs/html-docs/index.html <br>
although it might be elsewhere if your system administrator
chose to install the package elsewhere. Sometimes, errors
are corrected in the documentation and placed at <br>
http://atlc.sourceforge.net/ before a new release of atlc is
released. Please, if you notice a problem with the
documentation - even spelling errors and typos, please let
me <br>
know.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
create_bmp_for_circ_in_circ is a pre-processor for atlc, the
finite difference program that is used to calculate the
properties of a two and three conductor electrical
transmis&acirc; <br>
sion line of arbitrary cross section. The program
create_bmp_for_circ_in_circ is used as a fast way of
generating bitmaps (there is no need to use a graphics
program), for a cir&acirc; <br>
cular conductor inside a circular conductor (coaxial
conductors), like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The parameter &rsquo;D&rsquo; is
the inner dimensions of the outer conductor and
&rsquo;d&rsquo; is the outer diameter of the inner
conductor. The inner conductor is offset &rsquo;h&rsquo;
from the centre of the <br>
outer conductor. The whole region is surrounded by a
dielectric of relative permittivity &rsquo;Er&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The bitmap is printed to
&rsquo;outfile.bmp&rsquo; - the last command line
argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The bitmaps produced by
create_bmp_for_circ_in_circ are 24-bit bit colour bitmaps,
as are required by atlc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The permittivities of the
dielectric &rsquo;Er&rsquo; determines the colours in the
bitmap. If Er is 1.0, 1.006, 2.1, 2.2, 2.33, 2.5, 3.3,
3.335, 3,7, 4.8, 10.2 or 100, then the colour cor&acirc;
<br>
responding to that permittivity will be set according to the
colours defined in COLOURS below. If Er is not one of those
permittivities, the region of permittivity Er will be set
<br>
to the colour 0xCAFF00. The program atlc does not know what
this permittivity is, so atlc, must be told with the command
line option -d, as in example 4 below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-b bitmapsize <br>
is used to set the size of the bitmap, and so the accuracy
to which atlc is able to calculate the transmission
line&rsquo;s properties. The default value for
&rsquo;bitmapsize&rsquo; is normally <br>
4, although this is set at compile time. The value can be
set anywhere from 1 to 15, but more than 8 is probably not
sensible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f outfile <br>
Set the output filename. By default, the bitmap is sent to
stdout, but it *must* be sent to a file, with this option,
or as described above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v <br>
Causes create_bmp_for_circ_in_circ to print some data to
stderr. Note, nothing extra goes to standard output, as that
is expected to be redirected to a bitmap file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COLOURS <br>
The 24-bit bitmaps that atlc expects, have 8 bits assigned
to represent the amount of red, 8 for blue and 8 for green.
Hence there are 256 levels of red, green and blue, making a
<br>
total of 256*256*256=16777216 colours. Every one of the
possible 16777216 colours can be defined precisely by the
stating the exact amount of red, green and blue, as in:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">red = 255,000,000 or 0xff0000
<br>
green = 000,255,000 or 0x00ff00 <br>
blue = 000,000,255 or 0x0000ff <br>
black = 000,000,000 or 0x000000 <br>
white = 255,255,255 or 0xffffff <br>
Brown = 255,000,255 or 0xff00ff <br>
gray = 142,142,142 or 0x8e8e8e</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some colours, such as pink,
turquoise, sandy, brown, gray etc may mean slightly
different things to different people. This is not so with
atlc, as the program expects the colours <br>
below to be EXACTLY defined as given. Whether you feel the
colour is sandy or yellow is up to you, but if you use it in
your bitmap, then it either needs to be a colour reconised
<br>
by atlc, or you must define it with a command line option
(see OPTIONS and example 5 below). <br>
The following conductors are reconised by atlc: <br>
red = 255,000,000 or 0xff0000 is the live conductor. <br>
green = 000,255,000 or 0x00ff00 is the grounded conductor.
<br>
blue = 000,000,000 or 0x000000 is the negative conductor</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All bitmaps must have the live
(red) and grounded (green) conductor. The blue conductor is
not currently supported, but it will be used to indicate a
negative conductor, which <br>
will be needed if/when the program gets extended to analyse
directional couplers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following dielectrics are
reconised by atlc and so are produced by
create_bmp_for_circ_in_circ.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">white 255,255,255 or 0xFFFFFF as
Er=1.0 (vacuum) <br>
pink 255,202,202 or 0xFFCACA as Er=1.0006 (air) <br>
blue 000,000,255 or 0x0000FF as Er=2.1 (PTFE) <br>
Mid gray 142,242,142 or 0x8E8E8E as Er=2.2 (duroid 5880)
<br>
mauve 255.000,255 or 0xFF00FF as Er=2.33 (polyethylene) <br>
yellow 255,255,000 or 0xFFFF00 as Er=2.5 (polystyrene) <br>
sandy 239,203,027 or 0xEFCC1A as Er=3.3 (PVC) <br>
brown 188,127,096 or 0xBC7F60 as Er=3.335 (epoxy resin) <br>
Turquoise 026,239,179 or 0x1AEFB3 as Er=4.8 (glass PCB) <br>
Dark gray 142,142,142 or ox696969 as Er=6.15 (duroid 6006)
<br>
L. gray 240,240,240 or 0xDCDCDC as Er=10.2 (duroid 6010)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE <br>
Although create_bmp_for_circ_in_circ is used for circular
inner and outer conductors, the outside of the outer
conductor is drawn as a square. This is for convenience and
makes <br>
no difference to the calculations. The inside is of the
outer conductor is drawn as a circle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Here are a few examples of the use of
create_bmp_for_circ_in_circ. Again, see the html
documentation in atlc-X.Y.Z/docs/html-docs/index.html for
more examples.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1) In the first example, the
outer conductor has an inside diameter of 12 units (inches,
mm, feet etc.), the inner has an outside diameter of 3.9
units. The inner is placed cen&acirc; <br>
trally (h=0) and the dielectric is vacuum (Er=1.0). <br>
% create_bmp_for_circ_in_circ 12 3.9 0 1.0 coaxial_1.bmp
<br>
% atlc coaxial_1.bmp <br>
atlc will indicate the correct value of impedance to be
67.3667 Ohms, whereas an exact analysis will show the true
value to be 67.4358 Ohms, so atlc has an error of
0.102%.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2) In this second example, the
conductor sizes are the sames as in example 1, but the inner
is located 3.5 units off-centre and the dielectric has a
relative permittivity of 2.1 <br>
(Er of PTFE) The output is sent to a file not_in_centre.bmp
which is then processed by atlc <br>
% create_bmp_for_circ_in_circ 12 3.9 3.5 2.1
not_in_centre.bmp <br>
% atlc not_in_centre.bmp <br>
The impedance of this is theoretically 24.315342 Ohms, as
create_bmp_for_circ_in_circ will calculate for you.
atlc&rsquo;s estimate is 24.2493 Ohms, an error of only
-0.271 %.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3) In the third example the
bitmap is made larger, to increase accuracy, but otherwise
this is identical to the previous one. <br>
% create_bmp_for_circ_in_circ -b8 12 3.9 3.5 2.1
bigger_not_in_centre.bmp <br>
% atlc bigger_not_in_centre.bmp <br>
This time atlc will take much longer to calculate Zo, since
the bitmap is larger and so it needs to do more
calculations. However, the final result should be more
accurate. In <br>
this case, the result reported is 24.2461 Ohms, an error
that&rsquo;s marginally smaller than before at 0.285 %. It
is possible there may be something to be gained by
decreasing the <br>
cutoff at larger grids, so this is being investigated.
However, errors almost always below 0.25 %, no matter what
is being analysed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the fourth example, a
material with a relativity permittivity 7.89 of is used.
There is no change in how to use
create_bmp_for_circ_in_circ, but since this permittivity is
not <br>
one of the pre-defined values (see COLOURS), we must tell
atlc what it is. The colour will be set an olive green one,
with a hexacidcal representation of red=0xCA, blue=OxFF and
<br>
green = 0x00. This just happens to be the default colour
used when the permittivity is unknown. So atlc must be given
this information, like thisL <br>
% create_bmp_for_circ_in_circ 23 9 0 7.89 an_odd_er.bmp <br>
% atlc -d CAFF00=7.89 an_odd_er.bmp This has a theoretical
impedance of 20.041970 Ohms, but atlc version 3.0.1 will
calculate it to be 20.0300, an error of -0.058 % !!! If you
<br>
look at the file an_odd_er.bmp with a graphics package, you
will see there are 3 colours in it - the red inner
conductor, the green outer and an olive-green
dielectric.</p>
