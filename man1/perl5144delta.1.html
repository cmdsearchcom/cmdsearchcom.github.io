perl5144delta - what is new for perl v5.14.4
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
This document describes differences between the 5.14.3 release and the 5.14.4
  release.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.12.0, first read
  perl5140delta, which describes differences between 5.12.0 and 5.14.0.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Core_Enhancements"><a class="selflink" href="#Core_Enhancements">Core
  Enhancements</a></h1>
No changes since 5.14.0.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Security"><a class="selflink" href="#Security">Security</a></h1>
This release contains one major, and medium, and a number of minor security
  fixes. The latter are included mainly to allow the test suite to pass cleanly
  with the clang compiler's address sanitizer facility.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="CVE-2013-1667:_memory_exhaustion_with_arbitrary_hash_keys"><a class="selflink" href="#CVE-2013-1667:_memory_exhaustion_with_arbitrary_hash_keys">CVE-2013-1667:
  memory exhaustion with arbitrary hash keys</a></h2>
With a carefully crafted set of hash keys (for example arguments on a URL), it
  is possible to cause a hash to consume a large amount of memory and CPU, and
  thus possibly to achieve a Denial-of-Service.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This problem has been fixed.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="memory_leak_in_Encode"><a class="selflink" href="#memory_leak_in_Encode">memory
  leak in Encode</a></h2>
The UTF-8 encoding implementation in Encode.xs had a memory leak which has been
  fixed.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="[perl_#111594]_Socket::unpack_sockaddr_un_heap-buffer-overflow"><a class="selflink" href="#[perl_#111594]_Socket::unpack_sockaddr_un_heap-buffer-overflow">[perl
  #111594] Socket::unpack_sockaddr_un heap-buffer-overflow</a></h2>
A read buffer overflow could occur when copying &quot;sockaddr&quot; buffers.
  Fairly harmless.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This problem has been fixed.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="[perl_#111586]_SDBM_File:_fix_off-by-one_access_to_global_&quot;.dir&quot;"><a class="selflink" href="#[perl_#111586]_SDBM_File:_fix_off-by-one_access_to_global_&quot;.dir&quot;">[perl
  #111586] SDBM_File: fix off-by-one access to global &quot;.dir&quot;</a></h2>
An extra byte was being copied for some string literals. Fairly harmless.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This problem has been fixed.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="off-by-two_error_in_List::Util"><a class="selflink" href="#off-by-two_error_in_List::Util">off-by-two
  error in List::Util</a></h2>
A string literal was being used that included two bytes beyond the end of the
  string. Fairly harmless.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This problem has been fixed.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="[perl_#115994]_fix_segv_in_regcomp.c:S_join_exact()"><a class="selflink" href="#[perl_#115994]_fix_segv_in_regcomp.c:S_join_exact()">[perl
  #115994] fix segv in regcomp. <i>c:S_join_exact()</i></a></h2>
Under debugging builds, while marking optimised-out regex nodes as type
  &quot;OPTIMIZED&quot;, it could treat blocks of exact text as if they were
  nodes, and thus SEGV. Fairly harmless.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This problem has been fixed.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="[perl_#115992]_PL_eval_start_use-after-free"><a class="selflink" href="#[perl_#115992]_PL_eval_start_use-after-free">[perl
  #115992] PL_eval_start use-after-free</a></h2>
The statement &quot;local $[;&quot;, when preceded by an &quot;eval&quot;, and
  when not part of an assignment, could crash. Fairly harmless.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This problem has been fixed.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="wrap-around_with_IO_on_long_strings"><a class="selflink" href="#wrap-around_with_IO_on_long_strings">wrap-around
  with IO on long strings</a></h2>
Reading or writing strings greater than 2**31 bytes in size could segfault due
  to integer wraparound.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This problem has been fixed.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Incompatible_Changes"><a class="selflink" href="#Incompatible_Changes">Incompatible
  Changes</a></h1>
There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.14.0. If any exist, they
  are bugs and reports are welcome.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Deprecations"><a class="selflink" href="#Deprecations">Deprecations</a></h1>
There have been no deprecations since 5.14.0.

Perl 5.14.4 represents approximately 5 months of development since Perl 5.14.3
  and contains approximately 1,700 lines of changes across 49 files from 12
  authors.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Perl continues to flourish into its third decade thanks to a vibrant community
  of users and developers. The following people are known to have contributed
  the improvements that became Perl 5.14.4:
<div class="Pp"></div>
Andy Dougherty, Chris 'BinGOs' Williams, Christian Hansen, Craig A. Berry, Dave
  Rolsky, David Mitchell, Dominic Hargreaves, Father Chrysostomos, Florian
  Ragwitz, Reini Urban, Ricardo Signes, Yves Orton.

The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is automatically generated
  from version control history. In particular, it does not include the names of
  the (very much appreciated) contributors who reported issues to the Perl bug
  tracker.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For a more complete list of all of Perl's historical contributors, please see
  the <i>AUTHORS</i> file in the Perl source distribution.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Reporting_Bugs"><a class="selflink" href="#Reporting_Bugs">Reporting
  Bugs</a></h1>
If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently
  posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at
  http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/ . There may also be information at
  http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug program
  included with your release. Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
  sufficient test case. Your bug report, along with the output of &quot;perl
  -V&quot;, will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl
  porting team.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it
  inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send it
  to perl5-security-report@perl.org. This points to a closed subscription
  unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core committers, who be able
  to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help
  co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all
  platforms on which Perl is supported. Please only use this address for
  security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently distributed on
  CPAN.
