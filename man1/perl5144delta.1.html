<p>PERL5144DELTA(1) Perl Programmers Reference Guide
PERL5144DELTA(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
perl5144delta - what is new for perl v5.14.4</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This document describes differences between the 5.14.3
release and the 5.14.4 release.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are upgrading from an
earlier release such as 5.12.0, first read perl5140delta,
which describes differences between 5.12.0 and 5.14.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Core Enhancements <br>
No changes since 5.14.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Security <br>
This release contains one major, and medium, and a number of
minor security fixes. The latter are included mainly to
allow the test suite to pass cleanly with the clang <br>
compiler&rsquo;s address sanitizer facility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CVE-2013-1667: memory exhaustion
with arbitrary hash keys <br>
With a carefully crafted set of hash keys (for example
arguments on a URL), it is possible to cause a hash to
consume a large amount of memory and CPU, and thus possibly
to <br>
achieve a Denial-of-Service.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This problem has been fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">memory leak in Encode <br>
The UTF-8 encoding implementation in Encode.xs had a memory
leak which has been fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[perl #111594]
Socket::unpack_sockaddr_un heap-buffer-overflow <br>
A read buffer overflow could occur when copying
&quot;sockaddr&quot; buffers. Fairly harmless.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This problem has been fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[perl #111586] SDBM_File: fix
off-by-one access to global &quot;.dir&quot; <br>
An extra byte was being copied for some string literals.
Fairly harmless.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This problem has been fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">off-by-two error in List::Util
<br>
A string literal was being used that included two bytes
beyond the end of the string. Fairly harmless.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This problem has been fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[perl #115994] fix segv in
regcomp.c:S_join_exact() <br>
Under debugging builds, while marking optimised-out regex
nodes as type &quot;OPTIMIZED&quot;, it could treat blocks
of exact text as if they were nodes, and thus SEGV. Fairly
harmless.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This problem has been fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[perl #115992] PL_eval_start
use-after-free <br>
The statement &quot;local $[;&quot;, when preceded by an
&quot;eval&quot;, and when not part of an assignment, could
crash. Fairly harmless.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This problem has been fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wrap-around with IO on long
strings <br>
Reading or writing strings greater than 2**31 bytes in size
could segfault due to integer wraparound.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This problem has been fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Incompatible Changes <br>
There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.14.0.
If any exist, they are bugs and reports are welcome.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Deprecations <br>
There have been no deprecations since 5.14.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Modules and Pragmata <br>
New Modules and Pragmata <br>
None</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Updated Modules and Pragmata
<br>
The following modules have just the minor code fixes as
listed above in &quot;Security&quot; (version numbers have
not changed):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Socket <br>
SDBM_File <br>
List::Util</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Encode has been upgraded from
version 2.42_01 to version 2.42_02.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Module::CoreList has been
updated to version 2.49_06 to add data for this release.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Removed Modules and Pragmata
<br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Documentation <br>
New Documentation <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Changes to Existing
Documentation <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Diagnostics <br>
No new or changed diagnostics.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Utility Changes <br>
None</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Configuration and Compilation
<br>
No changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Platform Support <br>
New Platforms <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Discontinued Platforms <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Platform-Specific Notes <br>
VMS 5.14.3 failed to compile on VMS due to incomplete
application of a patch series that allowed
&quot;userelocatableinc&quot; and
&quot;usesitecustomize&quot; to be used simultaneously.
Other <br>
platforms were not affected and the problem has now been
corrected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Selected Bug Fixes <br>
&Acirc;&middot; In Perl 5.14.0, &quot;$tainted ~~
@array&quot; stopped working properly. Sometimes it would
erroneously fail (when $tainted contained a string that
occurs in the array after the first <br>
element) or erroneously succeed (when &quot;undef&quot;
occurred after the first element) [perl #93590].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Known Problems <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Acknowledgements <br>
Perl 5.14.4 represents approximately 5 months of development
since Perl 5.14.3 and contains approximately 1,700 lines of
changes across 49 files from 12 authors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl continues to flourish into
its third decade thanks to a vibrant community of users and
developers. The following people are known to have
contributed the improvements that <br>
became Perl 5.14.4:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Andy Dougherty, Chris
&rsquo;BinGOs&rsquo; Williams, Christian Hansen, Craig A.
Berry, Dave Rolsky, David Mitchell, Dominic Hargreaves,
Father Chrysostomos, Florian Ragwitz, Reini Urban, <br>
Ricardo Signes, Yves Orton.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The list above is almost
certainly incomplete as it is automatically generated from
version control history. In particular, it does not include
the names of the (very much <br>
appreciated) contributors who reported issues to the Perl
bug tracker.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For a more complete list of all
of Perl&rsquo;s historical contributors, please see the
AUTHORS file in the Perl source distribution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Reporting Bugs <br>
If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the
articles recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc
newsgroup and the perl bug database at
http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/ . <br>
There may also be information at http://www.perl.org/ , the
Perl Home Page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you believe you have an
unreported bug, please run the perlbug program included with
your release. Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case. Your bug <br>
report, along with the output of &quot;perl -V&quot;, will
be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl
porting team.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the bug you are reporting has
security implications, which make it inappropriate to send
to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send it to
<br>
perl5-security-report@perl.org. This points to a closed
subscription unarchived mailing list, which includes all the
core committers, who be able to help assess the impact of
<br>
issues, figure out a resolution, and help co-ordinate the
release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all
platforms on which Perl is supported. Please only use this
<br>
address for security issues in the Perl core, not for
modules independently distributed on CPAN.</p>
