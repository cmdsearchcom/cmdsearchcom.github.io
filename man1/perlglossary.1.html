<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">accessor methods</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">A &quot;method&quot; used to indirectly inspect or update
      an &quot;object&quot;'s state (its instance variables).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">actual arguments</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The scalar values that you supply to a &quot;function&quot;
      or &quot;subroutine&quot; when you call it. For instance, when you call
      &quot;power(&quot;puff&quot;)&quot;, the string &quot;puff&quot; is the
      actual argument. See also &quot;argument&quot; and &quot;formal
      arguments&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">address operator</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Some languages work directly with the memory addresses of
      values, but this can be like playing with fire. Perl provides a set of
      asbestos gloves for handling all memory management. The closest to an
      address operator in Perl is the backslash operator, but it gives you a
      &quot;hard reference&quot;, which is much safer than a memory
    address.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">algorithm</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">A well-defined sequence of steps, clearly enough explained
      that even a computer could do them.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">alias</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">A nickname for something, which behaves in all ways as
      though you'd used the original name instead of the nickname. Temporary
      aliases are implicitly created in the loop variable for
      &quot;foreach&quot; loops, in the $_ variable for map or grep operators,
      in $a and $b during sort's comparison function, and in each element of @_
      for the &quot;actual arguments&quot; of a subroutine call. Permanent
      aliases are explicitly created in packages by importing symbols or by
      assignment to typeglobs. Lexically scoped aliases for package variables
      are explicitly created by the our declaration.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">alternatives</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">A list of possible choices from which you may select only
      one, as in &quot;Would you like door A, B, or C?&quot; Alternatives in
      regular expressions are separated with a single vertical bar:
      &quot;|&quot;. Alternatives in normal Perl expressions are separated with
      a double vertical bar: &quot;||&quot;. Logical alternatives in
      &quot;Boolean&quot; expressions are separated with either &quot;||&quot;
      or &quot;or&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">anonymous</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Used to describe a &quot;referent&quot; that is not
      directly accessible through a named &quot;variable&quot;. Such a referent
      must be indirectly accessible through at least one &quot;hard
      reference&quot;. When the last hard reference goes away, the anonymous
      referent is destroyed without pity.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">architecture</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The kind of computer you're working on, where one
      &quot;kind&quot; of computer means all those computers sharing a
      compatible machine language. Since Perl programs are (typically) simple
      text files, not executable images, a Perl program is much less sensitive
      to the architecture it's running on than programs in other languages, such
      as C, that are compiled into machine code. See also &quot;platform&quot;
      and &quot;operating system&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">argument</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">A piece of data supplied to a program,
      &quot;subroutine&quot;, &quot;function&quot;, or &quot;method&quot; to

    &quot;parameter&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">ARGV</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The name of the array containing the &quot;argument&quot;
      &quot;vector&quot; from the command line. If you use the empty
      &quot;&lt;&gt;&quot; operator, &quot;ARGV&quot; is the name of both the
      &quot;filehandle&quot; used to traverse the arguments and the
      &quot;scalar&quot; containing the name of the current input file.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">arithmetical operator</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">A &quot;symbol&quot; such as &quot;+&quot; or &quot;/&quot;

      school.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">array</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">An ordered sequence of values, stored such that you can

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">ASCII</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The American Standard Code for Information Interchange (a
      7-bit character set adequate only for poorly representing English text).
      Often used loosely to describe the lowest 128 values of the various
      ISO-8859-X character sets, a bunch of mutually incompatible 8-bit codes
      sometimes described as half ASCII. See also &quot;Unicode&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">assertion</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">A component of a &quot;regular expression&quot; that must
      be true for the pattern to match but does not necessarily match any
      characters itself. Often used specifically to mean a &quot;zero
      width&quot; assertion.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">assignment</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">An &quot;operator&quot; whose assigned mission in life is
      to change the value of a &quot;variable&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">assignment operator</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Either a regular &quot;assignment&quot;, or a compound
      &quot;operator&quot; composed of an ordinary assignment and some other
      operator, that changes the value of a variable in place, that is, relative
      to its old value. For example, &quot;$a += 2&quot; adds 2 to $a.</dd>

  <dt class="It-tag">associativity</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Determines whether you do the left &quot;operator&quot;
      first or the right &quot;operator&quot; first when you have &quot;A
      &quot;operator&quot; B &quot;operator&quot; C&quot; and the two operators
      are of the same precedence. Operators like &quot;+&quot; are left
      associative, while operators like &quot;**&quot; are right associative.
      See perlop for a list of operators and their associativity.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">asynchronous</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Said of events or activities whose relative temporal
      ordering is indeterminate because too many things are going on at once.
      Hence, an asynchronous event is one you didn't know when to expect.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">atom</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">A &quot;regular expression&quot; component potentially
      matching a &quot;substring&quot; containing one or more characters and
      treated as an indivisible syntactic unit by any following
      &quot;quantifier&quot;. (Contrast with an &quot;assertion&quot; that
      matches something of &quot;zero width&quot; and may not be
    quantified.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">atomic operation</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">When Democritus gave the word &quot;atom&quot; to the
      indivisible bits of matter, he meant literally something that could not be
      cut: <i>a-</i> (not) + <i>tomos</i> (cuttable). An atomic operation is an
      action that can't be interrupted, not one forbidden in a nuclear-free
      zone.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">attribute</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">A new feature that allows the declaration of variables and
      subroutines with modifiers as in &quot;sub foo : locked method&quot;.
      Also, another name for an &quot;instance variable&quot; of an
      &quot;object&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">autogeneration</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">A feature of &quot;operator overloading&quot; of objects,
      whereby the behavior of certain operators can be reasonably deduced using
      more fundamental operators. This assumes that the overloaded operators
      will often have the same relationships as the regular operators. See
      perlop.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">autoincrement</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">To add one to something automatically, hence the name of
      the &quot;++&quot; operator. To instead subtract one from something
      automatically is known as an &quot;autodecrement&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">autoload</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">To load on demand. (Also called &quot;lazy&quot; loading.)
      Specifically, to call an AUTOLOAD subroutine on behalf of an undefined
      subroutine.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">autosplit</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">To split a string automatically, as the <b>-a</b>
      &quot;switch&quot; does when running under <b>-p</b> or <b>-n</b> in order
      to emulate &quot;awk&quot;. (See also the AutoSplit module, which has
      nothing to do with the <b>-a</b> switch, but a lot to do with
      autoloading.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">autovivification</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">A Greco-Roman word meaning &quot;to bring oneself to
      life&quot;. In Perl, storage locations (lvalues) spontaneously generate
      themselves as needed, including the creation of any &quot;hard
      reference&quot; values to point to the next level of storage. The
      assignment &quot;$a[5][5][5][5][5] = &quot;quintet&quot;&quot; potentially
      creates five scalar storage locations, plus four references (in the first
      four scalar locations) pointing to four new anonymous arrays (to hold the
      last four scalar locations). But the point of autovivification is that you
      don't have to worry about it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">AV</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Short for &quot;array value&quot;, which refers to one of
      Perl's internal data types that holds an &quot;array&quot;. The
      &quot;AV&quot; type is a subclass of &quot;SV&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">awk</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Descriptive editing term--short for &quot;awkward&quot;.
      Also coincidentally refers to a venerable text-processing language from
      which Perl derived some of its high-level ideas.</dd>
</dl>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="B"><a class="selflink" href="#B">B</a></h2>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">backreference</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">A substring captured by a subpattern within unadorned
      parentheses in a &quot;regex&quot;, also referred to as a capture group.
      The sequences (&quot;\g1&quot;, &quot;\g2&quot;, etc.) later in the same
      pattern refer back to the corresponding subpattern in the current match.
      Outside the pattern, the numbered variables ($1, $2, etc.) continue to
      refer to these same values, as long as the pattern was the last successful
      match of the current dynamic scope. &quot;\g{-1}&quot; can be used to
      refer to a group by relative rather than absolute position; and groups can
      be also be named, and referred to later by name rather than number. See
      &quot;Capture groups&quot; in perlre.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">backtracking</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The practice of saying, &quot;If I had to do it all over,
      I'd do it differently,&quot; and then actually going back and doing it all
      over differently. Mathematically speaking, it's returning from an
      unsuccessful recursion on a tree of possibilities. Perl backtracks when it
      attempts to match patterns with a &quot;regular expression&quot;, and its
      earlier attempts don't pan out. See &quot;Backtracking&quot; in
    perlre.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">backward compatibility</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Means you can still run your old program because we didn't
      break any of the features or bugs it was relying on.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">bareword</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">A word sufficiently ambiguous to be deemed illegal under
      use strict 'subs'. In the absence of that stricture, a bareword is treated
      as if quotes were around it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">base class</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">A generic &quot;object&quot; type; that is, a
      &quot;class&quot; from which other, more specific classes are derived
      genetically by &quot;inheritance&quot;. Also called a
      &quot;superclass&quot; by people who respect their ancestors.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">big-endian</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">From Swift: someone who eats eggs big end first. Also used
      of computers that store the most significant &quot;byte&quot; of a word at
      a lower byte address than the least significant byte. Often considered
      superior to little-endian machines. See also
    &quot;little-endian&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">binary</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Having to do with numbers represented in base 2. That means
      there's basically two numbers, 0 and 1. Also used to describe a
      &quot;non-text file&quot;, presumably because such a file makes full use
      of all the binary bits in its bytes. With the advent of
      &quot;Unicode&quot;, this distinction, already suspect, loses even more of
      its meaning.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">binary operator</dt>

  <dt class="It-tag">bit</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">An integer in the range from 0 to 1, inclusive. The
      smallest possible unit of information storage. An eighth of a
      &quot;byte&quot; or of a dollar. (The term &quot;Pieces of Eight&quot;
      comes from being able to split the old Spanish dollar into 8 bits, each of
      which still counted for money. That's why a 25-cent piece today is still
      &quot;two bits&quot;.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">bit shift</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The movement of bits left or right in a computer word,

</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">bit string</dt>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">bless</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">In corporate life, to grant official approval to a thing,
      as in, &quot;The VP of Engineering has blessed our WebCruncher
      project.&quot; Similarly in Perl, to grant official approval to a
      &quot;referent&quot; so that it can function as an &quot;object&quot;,
      such as a WebCruncher object. See &quot;bless&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">block</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">What a &quot;process&quot; does when it has to wait for
      something: &quot;My process blocked waiting for the disk.&quot; As an
      unrelated noun, it refers to a large chunk of data, of a size that the
      &quot;operating system&quot; likes to deal with (normally a power of two
      such as 512 or 8192). Typically refers to a chunk of data that's coming
      from or going to a disk file.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">BLOCK</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">A syntactic construct consisting of a sequence of Perl
      statements that is delimited by braces. The &quot;if&quot; and
      &quot;while&quot; statements are defined in terms of BLOCKs, for instance.
      Sometimes we also say &quot;block&quot; to mean a lexical scope; that is,
      a sequence of statements that act like a &quot;BLOCK&quot;, such as within
      an eval or a file, even though the statements aren't delimited by
    braces.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">block buffering</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">A method of making input and output efficient by passing

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">Boolean context</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">A special kind of &quot;scalar context&quot; used in
      conditionals to decide whether the &quot;scalar value&quot; returned by an

      either a string or a number. See &quot;context&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">breakpoint</dt>

  <dt class="It-tag">BSD</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">A psychoactive drug, popular in the 80s, probably developed
      at U. C. Berkeley or thereabouts. Similar in many ways to the
      prescription-only medication called &quot;System V&quot;, but infinitely

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">bucket</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">A location in a &quot;hash table&quot; containing

      have to worry about it, unless you're into internals, or policy.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">buffer</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">A temporary holding location for data. Block buffering
      means that the data is passed on to its destination whenever the buffer is
      full. Line buffering means that it's passed on whenever a complete line is
      received. Command buffering means that it's passed every time you do a
      print command (or equivalent). If your output is unbuffered, the system
      processes it one byte at a time without the use of a holding area. This
      can be rather inefficient.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">built-in</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">A &quot;function&quot; that is predefined in the language.

  <dt class="It-tag">bytecode</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">A pidgin-like language spoken among 'droids when they don't
      wish to reveal their orientation (see &quot;endian&quot;). Named after
      some similar languages spoken (for similar reasons) between compilers and
      interpreters in the late 20th century. These languages are characterized

      and heavy &quot;overloading&quot; of the function-call mechanism. (Well,
      actually, people first switched to C because they found lowercase

      perl itself. Furthermore, the CPAN (which didn't exist at the time of Perl
      5.0) can become the new home of dropped modules. Dropping modules is
      currently not an option, but further developments may clear the last
      barriers.</dd>

      seem like you have a little more memory than you really do, but it's not a
      substitute for real memory. The best thing that can be said about virtual
      memory is that it lets your performance degrade gradually rather than
      suddenly when you run out of real memory. But your program can die when
