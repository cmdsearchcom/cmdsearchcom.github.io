<p>PERLGLOSSARY(1) Perl Programmers Reference Guide
PERLGLOSSARY(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
perlglossary - Perl Glossary</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
A glossary of terms (technical and otherwise) used in the
Perl documentation. Other useful sources include the Free
On-Line Dictionary of Computing &lt;http://foldoc.org/&gt;,
the <br>
Jargon File &lt;http://catb.org/~esr/jargon/&gt;, and
Wikipedia &lt;http://www.wikipedia.org/&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A <br>
accessor methods <br>
A &quot;method&quot; used to indirectly inspect or update an
&quot;object&quot;&rsquo;s state (its instance
variables).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">actual arguments <br>
The scalar values that you supply to a &quot;function&quot;
or &quot;subroutine&quot; when you call it. For instance,
when you call &quot;power(&quot;puff&quot;)&quot;, the
string &quot;puff&quot; is the actual argument. <br>
See also &quot;argument&quot; and &quot;formal
arguments&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">address operator <br>
Some languages work directly with the memory addresses of
values, but this can be like playing with fire. Perl
provides a set of asbestos gloves for handling all memory
<br>
management. The closest to an address operator in Perl is
the backslash operator, but it gives you a &quot;hard
reference&quot;, which is much safer than a memory
address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">algorithm <br>
A well-defined sequence of steps, clearly enough explained
that even a computer could do them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">alias <br>
A nickname for something, which behaves in all ways as
though you&rsquo;d used the original name instead of the
nickname. Temporary aliases are implicitly created in the
loop <br>
variable for &quot;foreach&quot; loops, in the $_ variable
for map or grep operators, in $a and $b during sort&rsquo;s
comparison function, and in each element of @_ for the
&quot;actual <br>
arguments&quot; of a subroutine call. Permanent aliases are
explicitly created in packages by importing symbols or by
assignment to typeglobs. Lexically scoped aliases for <br>
package variables are explicitly created by the our
declaration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">alternatives <br>
A list of possible choices from which you may select only
one, as in &quot;Would you like door A, B, or C?&quot;
Alternatives in regular expressions are separated with a
single <br>
vertical bar: &quot;|&quot;. Alternatives in normal Perl
expressions are separated with a double vertical bar:
&quot;||&quot;. Logical alternatives in &quot;Boolean&quot;
expressions are separated with <br>
either &quot;||&quot; or &quot;or&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">anonymous <br>
Used to describe a &quot;referent&quot; that is not directly
accessible through a named &quot;variable&quot;. Such a
referent must be indirectly accessible through at least one
&quot;hard <br>
reference&quot;. When the last hard reference goes away, the
anonymous referent is destroyed without pity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">architecture <br>
The kind of computer you&rsquo;re working on, where one
&quot;kind&quot; of computer means all those computers
sharing a compatible machine language. Since Perl programs
are (typically) <br>
simple text files, not executable images, a Perl program is
much less sensitive to the architecture it&rsquo;s running
on than programs in other languages, such as C, that are
<br>
compiled into machine code. See also &quot;platform&quot;
and &quot;operating system&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">argument <br>
A piece of data supplied to a program,
&quot;subroutine&quot;, &quot;function&quot;, or
&quot;method&quot; to tell it what it&rsquo;s supposed to
do. Also called a &quot;parameter&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ARGV <br>
The name of the array containing the &quot;argument&quot;
&quot;vector&quot; from the command line. If you use the
empty &quot;&lt;&gt;&quot; operator, &quot;ARGV&quot; is the
name of both the &quot;filehandle&quot; used to <br>
traverse the arguments and the &quot;scalar&quot; containing
the name of the current input file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">arithmetical operator <br>
A &quot;symbol&quot; such as &quot;+&quot; or &quot;/&quot;
that tells Perl to do the arithmetic you were supposed to
learn in grade school.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">array <br>
An ordered sequence of values, stored such that you can
easily access any of the values using an integer
&quot;subscript&quot; that specifies the value&rsquo;s
&quot;offset&quot; in the sequence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">array context <br>
An archaic expression for what is more correctly referred to
as &quot;list context&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ASCII <br>
The American Standard Code for Information Interchange (a
7-bit character set adequate only for poorly representing
English text). Often used loosely to describe the lowest
<br>
128 values of the various ISO-8859-X character sets, a bunch
of mutually incompatible 8-bit codes sometimes described as
half ASCII. See also &quot;Unicode&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">assertion <br>
A component of a &quot;regular expression&quot; that must be
true for the pattern to match but does not necessarily match
any characters itself. Often used specifically to mean a
<br>
&quot;zero width&quot; assertion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">assignment <br>
An &quot;operator&quot; whose assigned mission in life is to
change the value of a &quot;variable&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">assignment operator <br>
Either a regular &quot;assignment&quot;, or a compound
&quot;operator&quot; composed of an ordinary assignment and
some other operator, that changes the value of a variable in
place, that is, <br>
relative to its old value. For example, &quot;$a += 2&quot;
adds 2 to $a.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">associative array <br>
See &quot;hash&quot;. Please.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">associativity <br>
Determines whether you do the left &quot;operator&quot;
first or the right &quot;operator&quot; first when you have
&quot;A &quot;operator&quot; B &quot;operator&quot; C&quot;
and the two operators are of the same <br>
precedence. Operators like &quot;+&quot; are left
associative, while operators like &quot;**&quot; are right
associative. See perlop for a list of operators and their
associativity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">asynchronous <br>
Said of events or activities whose relative temporal
ordering is indeterminate because too many things are going
on at once. Hence, an asynchronous event is one you
didn&rsquo;t <br>
know when to expect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">atom <br>
A &quot;regular expression&quot; component potentially
matching a &quot;substring&quot; containing one or more
characters and treated as an indivisible syntactic unit by
any following <br>
&quot;quantifier&quot;. (Contrast with an
&quot;assertion&quot; that matches something of &quot;zero
width&quot; and may not be quantified.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">atomic operation <br>
When Democritus gave the word &quot;atom&quot; to the
indivisible bits of matter, he meant literally something
that could not be cut: a- (not) + tomos (cuttable). An
atomic operation <br>
is an action that can&rsquo;t be interrupted, not one
forbidden in a nuclear-free zone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">attribute <br>
A new feature that allows the declaration of variables and
subroutines with modifiers as in &quot;sub foo : locked
method&quot;. Also, another name for an &quot;instance
variable&quot; of an <br>
&quot;object&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">autogeneration <br>
A feature of &quot;operator overloading&quot; of objects,
whereby the behavior of certain operators can be reasonably
deduced using more fundamental operators. This assumes that
the <br>
overloaded operators will often have the same relationships
as the regular operators. See perlop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">autoincrement <br>
To add one to something automatically, hence the name of the
&quot;++&quot; operator. To instead subtract one from
something automatically is known as an
&quot;autodecrement&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">autoload <br>
To load on demand. (Also called &quot;lazy&quot; loading.)
Specifically, to call an AUTOLOAD subroutine on behalf of an
undefined subroutine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">autosplit <br>
To split a string automatically, as the -a
&quot;switch&quot; does when running under -p or -n in order
to emulate &quot;awk&quot;. (See also the AutoSplit module,
which has nothing to do with <br>
the -a switch, but a lot to do with autoloading.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">autovivification <br>
A Greco-Roman word meaning &quot;to bring oneself to
life&quot;. In Perl, storage locations (lvalues)
spontaneously generate themselves as needed, including the
creation of any &quot;hard <br>
reference&quot; values to point to the next level of
storage. The assignment &quot;$a[5][5][5][5][5] =
&quot;quintet&quot;&quot; potentially creates five scalar
storage locations, plus four <br>
references (in the first four scalar locations) pointing to
four new anonymous arrays (to hold the last four scalar
locations). But the point of autovivification is that you
<br>
don&rsquo;t have to worry about it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AV Short for &quot;array
value&quot;, which refers to one of Perl&rsquo;s internal
data types that holds an &quot;array&quot;. The
&quot;AV&quot; type is a subclass of &quot;SV&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">awk Descriptive editing
term--short for &quot;awkward&quot;. Also coincidentally
refers to a venerable text-processing language from which
Perl derived some of its high-level ideas.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">B <br>
backreference <br>
A substring captured by a subpattern within unadorned
parentheses in a &quot;regex&quot;, also referred to as a
capture group. The sequences (&quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;,
etc.) later in the same <br>
pattern refer back to the corresponding subpattern in the
current match. Outside the pattern, the numbered variables
($1, $2, etc.) continue to refer to these same values, <br>
as long as the pattern was the last successful match of the
current dynamic scope. &quot;-1}&quot; can be used to refer
to a group by relative rather than absolute position; and
<br>
groups can be also be named, and referred to later by name
rather than number. See &quot;Capture groups&quot; in
perlre.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">backtracking <br>
The practice of saying, &quot;If I had to do it all over,
I&rsquo;d do it differently,&quot; and then actually going
back and doing it all over differently. Mathematically
speaking, it&rsquo;s <br>
returning from an unsuccessful recursion on a tree of
possibilities. Perl backtracks when it attempts to match
patterns with a &quot;regular expression&quot;, and its
earlier attempts <br>
don&rsquo;t pan out. See &quot;Backtracking&quot; in
perlre.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">backward compatibility <br>
Means you can still run your old program because we
didn&rsquo;t break any of the features or bugs it was
relying on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bareword <br>
A word sufficiently ambiguous to be deemed illegal under use
strict &rsquo;subs&rsquo;. In the absence of that stricture,
a bareword is treated as if quotes were around it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">base class <br>
A generic &quot;object&quot; type; that is, a
&quot;class&quot; from which other, more specific classes
are derived genetically by &quot;inheritance&quot;. Also
called a &quot;superclass&quot; by people who <br>
respect their ancestors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">big-endian <br>
From Swift: someone who eats eggs big end first. Also used
of computers that store the most significant
&quot;byte&quot; of a word at a lower byte address than the
least significant <br>
byte. Often considered superior to little-endian machines.
See also &quot;little-endian&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">binary <br>
Having to do with numbers represented in base 2. That means
there&rsquo;s basically two numbers, 0 and 1. Also used to
describe a &quot;non-text file&quot;, presumably because
such a file <br>
makes full use of all the binary bits in its bytes. With the
advent of &quot;Unicode&quot;, this distinction, already
suspect, loses even more of its meaning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">binary operator <br>
An &quot;operator&quot; that takes two operands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bind <br>
To assign a specific &quot;network address&quot; to a
&quot;socket&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bit An integer in the range from
0 to 1, inclusive. The smallest possible unit of information
storage. An eighth of a &quot;byte&quot; or of a dollar.
(The term &quot;Pieces of Eight&quot; comes <br>
from being able to split the old Spanish dollar into 8 bits,
each of which still counted for money. That&rsquo;s why a
25-cent piece today is still &quot;two bits&quot;.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bit shift <br>
The movement of bits left or right in a computer word, which
has the effect of multiplying or dividing by a power of
2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bit string <br>
A sequence of bits that is actually being thought of as a
sequence of bits, for once.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bless <br>
In corporate life, to grant official approval to a thing, as
in, &quot;The VP of Engineering has blessed our WebCruncher
project.&quot; Similarly in Perl, to grant official approval
to <br>
a &quot;referent&quot; so that it can function as an
&quot;object&quot;, such as a WebCruncher object. See
&quot;bless&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">block <br>
What a &quot;process&quot; does when it has to wait for
something: &quot;My process blocked waiting for the
disk.&quot; As an unrelated noun, it refers to a large chunk
of data, of a size that <br>
the &quot;operating system&quot; likes to deal with
(normally a power of two such as 512 or 8192). Typically
refers to a chunk of data that&rsquo;s coming from or going
to a disk file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BLOCK <br>
A syntactic construct consisting of a sequence of Perl
statements that is delimited by braces. The &quot;if&quot;
and &quot;while&quot; statements are defined in terms of
BLOCKs, for instance. <br>
Sometimes we also say &quot;block&quot; to mean a lexical
scope; that is, a sequence of statements that act like a
&quot;BLOCK&quot;, such as within an eval or a file, even
though the statements <br>
aren&rsquo;t delimited by braces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">block buffering <br>
A method of making input and output efficient by passing one
&quot;block&quot; at a time. By default, Perl does block
buffering to disk files. See &quot;buffer&quot; and
&quot;command buffering&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Boolean <br>
A value that is either &quot;true&quot; or
&quot;false&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Boolean context <br>
A special kind of &quot;scalar context&quot; used in
conditionals to decide whether the &quot;scalar value&quot;
returned by an expression is &quot;true&quot; or
&quot;false&quot;. Does not evaluate as either a <br>
string or a number. See &quot;context&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">breakpoint <br>
A spot in your program where you&rsquo;ve told the debugger
to stop execution so you can poke around and see whether
anything is wrong yet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">broadcast <br>
To send a &quot;datagram&quot; to multiple destinations
simultaneously.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BSD A psychoactive drug, popular
in the 80s, probably developed at U. C. Berkeley or
thereabouts. Similar in many ways to the prescription-only
medication called &quot;System V&quot;, but <br>
infinitely more useful. (Or, at least, more fun.) The full
chemical name is &quot;Berkeley Standard
Distribution&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bucket <br>
A location in a &quot;hash table&quot; containing
(potentially) multiple entries whose keys &quot;hash&quot;
to the same hash value according to its hash function. (As
internal policy, you <br>
don&rsquo;t have to worry about it, unless you&rsquo;re into
internals, or policy.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">buffer <br>
A temporary holding location for data. Block buffering means
that the data is passed on to its destination whenever the
buffer is full. Line buffering means that it&rsquo;s <br>
passed on whenever a complete line is received. Command
buffering means that it&rsquo;s passed every time you do a
print command (or equivalent). If your output is unbuffered,
<br>
the system processes it one byte at a time without the use
of a holding area. This can be rather inefficient.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">built-in <br>
A &quot;function&quot; that is predefined in the language.
Even when hidden by &quot;overriding&quot;, you can always
get at a built-in function by qualifying its name with the
&quot;CORE::&quot; pseudo- <br>
package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bundle <br>
A group of related modules on &quot;CPAN&quot;. (Also,
sometimes refers to a group of command-line switches grouped
into one &quot;switch cluster&quot;.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">byte <br>
A piece of data worth eight bits in most places.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bytecode <br>
A pidgin-like language spoken among &rsquo;droids when they
don&rsquo;t wish to reveal their orientation (see
&quot;endian&quot;). Named after some similar languages
spoken (for similar reasons) <br>
between compilers and interpreters in the late 20th century.
These languages are characterized by representing everything
as a non-architecture-dependent sequence of bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C <br>
C A language beloved by many for its inside-out
&quot;type&quot; definitions, inscrutable
&quot;precedence&quot; rules, and heavy
&quot;overloading&quot; of the function-call mechanism.
(Well, actually, <br>
people first switched to C because they found lowercase
identifiers easier to read than upper.) Perl is written in
C, so it&rsquo;s not surprising that Perl borrowed a few
ideas <br>
from it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C preprocessor <br>
The typical C compiler&rsquo;s first pass, which processes
lines beginning with &quot;#&quot; for conditional
compilation and macro definition and does various
manipulations of the program <br>
text based on the current definitions. Also known as
cpp(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">call by reference <br>
An &quot;argument&quot;-passing mechanism in which the
&quot;formal arguments&quot; refer directly to the
&quot;actual arguments&quot;, and the &quot;subroutine&quot;
can change the actual arguments by changing the <br>
formal arguments. That is, the formal argument is an
&quot;alias&quot; for the actual argument. See also
&quot;call by value&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">call by value <br>
An &quot;argument&quot;-passing mechanism in which the
&quot;formal arguments&quot; refer to a copy of the
&quot;actual arguments&quot;, and the &quot;subroutine&quot;
cannot change the actual arguments by changing <br>
the formal arguments. See also &quot;call by
reference&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">callback <br>
A &quot;handler&quot; that you register with some other part
of your program in the hope that the other part of your
program will &quot;trigger&quot; your handler when some
event of interest <br>
transpires.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">canonical <br>
Reduced to a standard form to facilitate comparison.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">capture buffer, capture group
<br>
These two terms are synonymous: a captured substring by a
regex subpattern.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">capturing <br>
The use of parentheses around a &quot;subpattern&quot; in a
&quot;regular expression&quot; to store the matched
&quot;substring&quot; as a &quot;backreference&quot; or
capture group. (Captured strings are also <br>
returned as a list in &quot;list context&quot;.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">character <br>
A small integer representative of a unit of orthography.
Historically, characters were usually stored as fixed-width
integers (typically in a byte, or maybe two, depending <br>
on the character set), but with the advent of UTF-8,
characters are often stored in a variable number of bytes
depending on the size of the integer that represents the
<br>
character. Perl manages this transparently for you, for the
most part.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">character class <br>
A square-bracketed list of characters used in a
&quot;regular expression&quot; to indicate that any
character of the set may occur at a given point. Loosely,
any predefined set of <br>
characters so used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">character property <br>
A predefined &quot;character class&quot; matchable by the
&quot;&quot; &quot;metasymbol&quot;. Many standard
properties are defined for &quot;Unicode&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">circumfix operator <br>
An &quot;operator&quot; that surrounds its
&quot;operand&quot;, like the angle operator, or
parentheses, or a hug.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">class <br>
A user-defined &quot;type&quot;, implemented in Perl via a
&quot;package&quot; that provides (either directly or by
inheritance) methods (that is, subroutines) to handle
instances of the class <br>
(its objects). See also &quot;inheritance&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">class method <br>
A &quot;method&quot; whose &quot;invocant&quot; is a
&quot;package&quot; name, not an &quot;object&quot;
reference. A method associated with the class as a
whole.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">client <br>
In networking, a &quot;process&quot; that initiates contact
with a &quot;server&quot; process in order to exchange data
and perhaps receive a service.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cloister <br>
A &quot;cluster&quot; used to restrict the scope of a
&quot;regular expression modifier&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">closure <br>
An &quot;anonymous&quot; subroutine that, when a reference
to it is generated at run time, keeps track of the
identities of externally visible lexical variables even
after those <br>
lexical variables have supposedly gone out of
&quot;scope&quot;. They&rsquo;re called &quot;closures&quot;
because this sort of behavior gives mathematicians a sense
of closure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cluster <br>
A parenthesized &quot;subpattern&quot; used to group parts
of a &quot;regular expression&quot; into a single
&quot;atom&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CODE <br>
The word returned by the ref function when you apply it to a
reference to a subroutine. See also &quot;CV&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">code generator <br>
A system that writes code for you in a low-level language,
such as code to implement the backend of a compiler. See
&quot;program generator&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">code point <br>
The position of a character in a character set encoding. The
character &quot;NULL&quot; is almost certainly at the zeroth
position in all character sets, so its code point is 0. The
<br>
code point for the &quot;SPACE&quot; character in the ASCII
character set is 0x20, or 32 decimal; in EBCDIC it is 0x40,
or 64 decimal. The ord function returns the code point of a
<br>
character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;code position&quot; and
&quot;ordinal&quot; mean the same thing as &quot;code
point&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">code subpattern <br>
A &quot;regular expression&quot; subpattern whose real
purpose is to execute some Perl code, for example, the
&quot;(?{...})&quot; and &quot;(??{...})&quot;
subpatterns.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">collating sequence <br>
The order into which characters sort. This is used by
&quot;string&quot; comparison routines to decide, for
example, where in this glossary to put &quot;collating
sequence&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">command <br>
In &quot;shell&quot; programming, the syntactic combination
of a program name and its arguments. More loosely, anything
you type to a shell (a command interpreter) that starts it
<br>
doing something. Even more loosely, a Perl
&quot;statement&quot;, which might start with a
&quot;label&quot; and typically ends with a semicolon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">command buffering <br>
A mechanism in Perl that lets you store up the output of
each Perl &quot;command&quot; and then flush it out as a
single request to the &quot;operating system&quot;.
It&rsquo;s enabled by setting the <br>
$| ($AUTOFLUSH) variable to a true value. It&rsquo;s used
when you don&rsquo;t want data sitting around not going
where it&rsquo;s supposed to, which may happen because the
default on a <br>
&quot;file&quot; or &quot;pipe&quot; is to use &quot;block
buffering&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">command name <br>
The name of the program currently executing, as typed on the
command line. In C, the &quot;command&quot; name is passed
to the program as the first command-line argument. In Perl,
it <br>
comes in separately as $0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">command-line arguments <br>
The values you supply along with a program name when you
tell a &quot;shell&quot; to execute a &quot;command&quot;.
These values are passed to a Perl program through @ARGV.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">comment <br>
A remark that doesn&rsquo;t affect the meaning of the
program. In Perl, a comment is introduced by a &quot;#&quot;
character and continues to the end of the line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">compilation unit <br>
The &quot;file&quot; (or &quot;string&quot;, in the case of
eval) that is currently being compiled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">compile phase <br>
Any time before Perl starts running your main program. See
also &quot;run phase&quot;. Compile phase is mostly spent in
&quot;compile time&quot;, but may also be spent in &quot;run
time&quot; when <br>
&quot;BEGIN&quot; blocks, use declarations, or constant
subexpressions are being evaluated. The startup and import
code of any use declaration is also run during compile
phase.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">compile time <br>
The time when Perl is trying to make sense of your code, as
opposed to when it thinks it knows what your code means and
is merely trying to do what it thinks your code says <br>
to do, which is &quot;run time&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">compiler <br>
Strictly speaking, a program that munches up another program
and spits out yet another file containing the program in a
&quot;more executable&quot; form, typically containing
native <br>
machine instructions. The perl program is not a compiler by
this definition, but it does contain a kind of compiler that
takes a program and turns it into a more executable <br>
form (syntax trees) within the perl process itself, which
the &quot;interpreter&quot; then interprets. There are,
however, extension modules to get Perl to act more like a
&quot;real&quot; <br>
compiler. See O.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">composer <br>
A &quot;constructor&quot; for a &quot;referent&quot; that
isn&rsquo;t really an &quot;object&quot;, like an anonymous
array or a hash (or a sonata, for that matter). For example,
a pair of braces acts as a <br>
composer for a hash, and a pair of brackets acts as a
composer for an array. See &quot;Making References&quot; in
perlref.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">concatenation <br>
The process of gluing one cat&rsquo;s nose to another
cat&rsquo;s tail. Also, a similar operation on two
strings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">conditional <br>
Something &quot;iffy&quot;. See &quot;Boolean
context&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">connection <br>
In telephony, the temporary electrical circuit between the
caller&rsquo;s and the callee&rsquo;s phone. In networking,
the same kind of temporary circuit between a
&quot;client&quot; and a <br>
&quot;server&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">construct <br>
As a noun, a piece of syntax made up of smaller pieces. As a
transitive verb, to create an &quot;object&quot; using a
&quot;constructor&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">constructor <br>
Any &quot;class method&quot;, instance &quot;method&quot;,
or &quot;subroutine&quot; that composes, initializes,
blesses, and returns an &quot;object&quot;. Sometimes we use
the term loosely to mean a &quot;composer&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">context <br>
The surroundings, or environment. The context given by the
surrounding code determines what kind of data a particular
&quot;expression&quot; is expected to return. The three
primary <br>
contexts are &quot;list context&quot;, &quot;scalar
context&quot;, and &quot;void context&quot;. Scalar context
is sometimes subdivided into &quot;Boolean context&quot;,
&quot;numeric context&quot;, &quot;string context&quot;, and
<br>
&quot;void context&quot;. There&rsquo;s also a
&quot;don&rsquo;t care&quot; scalar context (which is dealt
with in Programming Perl, Third Edition, Chapter 2,
&quot;Bits and Pieces&quot; if you care).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">continuation <br>
The treatment of more than one physical &quot;line&quot; as
a single logical line. &quot;Makefile&quot; lines are
continued by putting a backslash before the
&quot;newline&quot;. Mail headers as defined <br>
by RFC 822 are continued by putting a space or tab after the
newline. In general, lines in Perl do not need any form of
continuation mark, because &quot;whitespace&quot; (including
<br>
newlines) is gleefully ignored. Usually.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">core dump <br>
The corpse of a &quot;process&quot;, in the form of a file
left in the &quot;working directory&quot; of the process,
usually as a result of certain kinds of fatal error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CPAN <br>
The Comprehensive Perl Archive Network. (See &quot;What
modules and extensions are available for Perl? What is
CPAN?&quot; in perlfaq2).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cracker <br>
Someone who breaks security on computer systems. A cracker
may be a true &quot;hacker&quot; or only a &quot;script
kiddie&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">current package <br>
The &quot;package&quot; in which the current statement is
compiled. Scan backwards in the text of your program through
the current lexical scope or any enclosing lexical scopes
till <br>
you find a package declaration. That&rsquo;s your current
package name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">current working directory <br>
See &quot;working directory&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">currently selected output
channel <br>
The last &quot;filehandle&quot; that was designated with
select(&quot;FILEHANDLE&quot;); &quot;STDOUT&quot;, if no
filehandle has been selected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CV An internal &quot;code
value&quot; typedef, holding a &quot;subroutine&quot;. The
&quot;CV&quot; type is a subclass of &quot;SV&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">D <br>
dangling statement <br>
A bare, single &quot;statement&quot;, without any braces,
hanging off an &quot;if&quot; or &quot;while&quot;
conditional. C allows them. Perl doesn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">data structure <br>
How your various pieces of data relate to each other and
what shape they make when you put them all together, as in a
rectangular table or a triangular-shaped tree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">data type <br>
A set of possible values, together with all the operations
that know how to deal with those values. For example, a
numeric data type has a certain set of numbers that you <br>
can work with and various mathematical operations that you
can do on the numbers but would make little sense on, say, a
string such as &quot;Kilroy&quot;. Strings have their own
<br>
operations, such as &quot;concatenation&quot;. Compound
types made of a number of smaller pieces generally have
operations to compose and decompose them, and perhaps to
rearrange <br>
them. Objects that model things in the real world often have
operations that correspond to real activities. For instance,
if you model an elevator, your elevator object <br>
might have an &quot;open_door()&quot;
&quot;method&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">datagram <br>
A packet of data, such as a &quot;UDP&quot; message, that
(from the viewpoint of the programs involved) can be sent
independently over the network. (In fact, all packets are
sent <br>
independently at the &quot;IP&quot; level, but
&quot;stream&quot; protocols such as &quot;TCP&quot; hide
this from your program.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DBM Stands for &quot;Data Base
Management&quot; routines, a set of routines that emulate an
&quot;associative array&quot; using disk files. The routines
use a dynamic hashing scheme to locate any <br>
entry with only two disk accesses. DBM files allow a Perl
program to keep a persistent &quot;hash&quot; across
multiple invocations. You can tie your hash variables to
various DBM <br>
implementations--see AnyDBM_File and DB_File.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">declaration <br>
An &quot;assertion&quot; that states something exists and
perhaps describes what it&rsquo;s like, without giving any
commitment as to how or where you&rsquo;ll use it. A
declaration is like the <br>
part of your recipe that says, &quot;two cups flour, one
large egg, four or five tadpoles...&quot; See
&quot;statement&quot; for its opposite. Note that some
declarations also function as <br>
statements. Subroutine declarations also act as definitions
if a body is supplied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">decrement <br>
To subtract a value from a variable, as in &quot;decrement
$x&quot; (meaning to remove 1 from its value) or
&quot;decrement $x by 3&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">default <br>
A &quot;value&quot; chosen for you if you don&rsquo;t supply
a value of your own.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">defined <br>
Having a meaning. Perl thinks that some of the things people
try to do are devoid of meaning, in particular, making use
of variables that have never been given a &quot;value&quot;
and <br>
performing certain operations on data that isn&rsquo;t
there. For example, if you try to read data past the end of
a file, Perl will hand you back an undefined value. See also
<br>
&quot;false&quot; and &quot;defined&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">delimiter <br>
A &quot;character&quot; or &quot;string&quot; that sets
bounds to an arbitrarily-sized textual object, not to be
confused with a &quot;separator&quot; or
&quot;terminator&quot;. &quot;To delimit&quot; really just
means &quot;to <br>
surround&quot; or &quot;to enclose&quot; (like these
parentheses are doing).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">deprecated modules and features
<br>
Deprecated modules and features are those which were part of
a stable release, but later found to be subtly flawed, and
which should be avoided. They are subject to removal <br>
and/or bug-incompatible reimplementation in the next major
release (but they will be preserved through maintenance
releases). Deprecation warnings are issued under -w or <br>
&quot;use diagnostics&quot;, and notices are found in
perldeltas, as well as various other PODs. Coding practices
that misuse features, such as &quot;my $foo if 0&quot;, can
also be deprecated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dereference <br>
A fancy computer science term meaning &quot;to follow a
&quot;reference&quot; to what it points to&quot;. The
&quot;de&quot; part of it refers to the fact that
you&rsquo;re taking away one level of <br>
&quot;indirection&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">derived class <br>
A &quot;class&quot; that defines some of its methods in
terms of a more generic class, called a &quot;base
class&quot;. Note that classes aren&rsquo;t classified
exclusively into base classes or <br>
derived classes: a class can function as both a derived
class and a base class simultaneously, which is kind of
classy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">descriptor <br>
See &quot;file descriptor&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">destroy <br>
To deallocate the memory of a &quot;referent&quot; (first
triggering its &quot;DESTROY&quot; method, if it has
one).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">destructor <br>
A special &quot;method&quot; that is called when an
&quot;object&quot; is thinking about destroying itself. A
Perl program&rsquo;s &quot;DESTROY&quot; method
doesn&rsquo;t do the actual destruction; Perl just <br>
triggers the method in case the &quot;class&quot; wants to
do any associated cleanup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">device <br>
A whiz-bang hardware gizmo (like a disk or tape drive or a
modem or a joystick or a mouse) attached to your computer,
that the &quot;operating system&quot; tries to make look
like a <br>
&quot;file&quot; (or a bunch of files). Under Unix, these
fake files tend to live in the /dev directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">directive <br>
A &quot;pod&quot; directive. See perlpod.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">directory <br>
A special file that contains other files. Some operating
systems call these &quot;folders&quot;, &quot;drawers&quot;,
or &quot;catalogs&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">directory handle <br>
A name that represents a particular instance of opening a
directory to read it, until you close it. See the opendir
function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dispatch <br>
To send something to its correct destination. Often used
metaphorically to indicate a transfer of programmatic
control to a destination selected algorithmically, often by
<br>
lookup in a table of function references or, in the case of
object methods, by traversing the inheritance tree looking
for the most specific definition for the method.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">distribution <br>
A standard, bundled release of a system of software. The
default usage implies source code is included. If that is
not the case, it will be called a &quot;binary-only&quot;
<br>
distribution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(to be) dropped modules <br>
When Perl 5 was first released (see perlhist), several
modules were included, which have now fallen out of common
use. It has been suggested that these modules should be <br>
removed, since the distribution became rather large, and the
common criterion for new module additions is now limited to
modules that help to build, test, and extend perl <br>
itself. Furthermore, the CPAN (which didn&rsquo;t exist at
the time of Perl 5.0) can become the new home of dropped
modules. Dropping modules is currently not an option, but
<br>
further developments may clear the last barriers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dweomer <br>
An enchantment, illusion, phantasm, or jugglery. Said when
Perl&rsquo;s magical &quot;dwimmer&quot; effects don&rsquo;t
do what you expect, but rather seem to be the product of
arcane <br>
dweomercraft, sorcery, or wonder working. [From Old
English]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dwimmer <br>
DWIM is an acronym for &quot;Do What I Mean&quot;, the
principle that something should just do what you want it to
do without an undue amount of fuss. A bit of code that does
<br>
&quot;dwimming&quot; is a &quot;dwimmer&quot;. Dwimming can
require a great deal of behind-the-scenes magic, which (if
it doesn&rsquo;t stay properly behind the scenes) is called
a &quot;dweomer&quot; instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dynamic scoping <br>
Dynamic scoping works over a dynamic scope, making variables
visible throughout the rest of the &quot;block&quot; in
which they are first used and in any subroutines that are
called by <br>
the rest of the block. Dynamically scoped variables can have
their values temporarily changed (and implicitly restored
later) by a local operator. (Compare &quot;lexical <br>
scoping&quot;.) Used more loosely to mean how a subroutine
that is in the middle of calling another subroutine
&quot;contains&quot; that subroutine at &quot;run
time&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">E <br>
eclectic <br>
Derived from many sources. Some would say too many.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">element <br>
A basic building block. When you&rsquo;re talking about an
&quot;array&quot;, it&rsquo;s one of the items that make up
the array.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">embedding <br>
When something is contained in something else, particularly
when that might be considered surprising: &quot;I&rsquo;ve
embedded a complete Perl interpreter in my editor!&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">empty list <br>
See &lt;/null list&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">empty subclass test <br>
The notion that an empty &quot;derived class&quot; should
behave exactly like its &quot;base class&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">en passant <br>
When you change a &quot;value&quot; as it is being copied.
[From French, &quot;in passing&quot;, as in the exotic
pawn-capturing maneuver in chess.]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">encapsulation <br>
The veil of abstraction separating the &quot;interface&quot;
from the &quot;implementation&quot; (whether enforced or
not), which mandates that all access to an
&quot;object&quot;&rsquo;s state be through <br>
methods alone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">endian <br>
See &quot;little-endian&quot; and
&quot;big-endian&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">environment <br>
The collective set of environment variables your
&quot;process&quot; inherits from its parent. Accessed via
%ENV.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">environment variable <br>
A mechanism by which some high-level agent such as a user
can pass its preferences down to its future offspring (child
processes, grandchild processes, great-grandchild <br>
processes, and so on). Each environment variable is a
&quot;key&quot;/&quot;value&quot; pair, like one entry in a
&quot;hash&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EOF End of File. Sometimes used
metaphorically as the terminating string of a &quot;here
document&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">errno <br>
The error number returned by a &quot;syscall&quot; when it
fails. Perl refers to the error by the name $! (or $OS_ERROR
if you use the English module).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">error <br>
See &quot;exception&quot; or &quot;fatal error&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">escape sequence <br>
See &quot;metasymbol&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">exception <br>
A fancy term for an error. See &quot;fatal error&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">exception handling <br>
The way a program responds to an error. The exception
handling mechanism in Perl is the eval operator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">exec <br>
To throw away the current &quot;process&quot;&rsquo;s
program and replace it with another without exiting the
process or relinquishing any resources held (apart from the
old memory image).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">executable file <br>
A &quot;file&quot; that is specially marked to tell the
&quot;operating system&quot; that it&rsquo;s okay to run
this file as a program. Usually shortened to
&quot;executable&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">execute <br>
To run a program or &quot;subroutine&quot;. (Has nothing to
do with the kill built-in, unless you&rsquo;re trying to run
a &quot;signal handler&quot;.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">execute bit <br>
The special mark that tells the operating system it can run
this program. There are actually three execute bits under
Unix, and which bit gets used depends on whether you <br>
own the file singularly, collectively, or not at all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">exit status <br>
See &quot;status&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">export <br>
To make symbols from a &quot;module&quot; available for
&quot;import&quot; by other modules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">expression <br>
Anything you can legally say in a spot where a
&quot;value&quot; is required. Typically composed of
literals, variables, operators, functions, and
&quot;subroutine&quot; calls, not necessarily <br>
in that order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">extension <br>
A Perl module that also pulls in compiled C or C++ code.
More generally, any experimental option that can be compiled
into Perl, such as multithreading.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">F <br>
false <br>
In Perl, any value that would look like &quot;&quot; or
&quot;0&quot; if evaluated in a string context. Since
undefined values evaluate to &quot;&quot;, all undefined
values are false (including the <br>
&quot;null list&quot;), but not all false values are
undefined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FAQ Frequently Asked Question
(although not necessarily frequently answered, especially if
the answer appears in the Perl FAQ shipped standard with
Perl).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fatal error <br>
An uncaught &quot;exception&quot;, which causes termination
of the &quot;process&quot; after printing a message on your
&quot;standard error&quot; stream. Errors that happen inside
an eval are not fatal. <br>
Instead, the eval terminates after placing the exception
message in the $@ ($EVAL_ERROR) variable. You can try to
provoke a fatal error with the die operator (known as <br>
throwing or raising an exception), but this may be caught by
a dynamically enclosing eval. If not caught, the die becomes
a fatal error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">field <br>
A single piece of numeric or string data that is part of a
longer &quot;string&quot;, &quot;record&quot;, or
&quot;line&quot;. Variable-width fields are usually split up
by separators (so use split to <br>
extract the fields), while fixed-width fields are usually at
fixed positions (so use unpack). Instance variables are also
known as fields.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FIFO <br>
First In, First Out. See also &quot;LIFO&quot;. Also, a
nickname for a &quot;named pipe&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file <br>
A named collection of data, usually stored on disk in a
&quot;directory&quot; in a &quot;filesystem&quot;. Roughly
like a document, if you&rsquo;re into office metaphors. In
modern filesystems, you <br>
can actually give a file more than one name. Some files have
special properties, like directories and devices.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file descriptor <br>
The little number the &quot;operating system&quot; uses to
keep track of which opened &quot;file&quot; you&rsquo;re
talking about. Perl hides the file descriptor inside a
&quot;standard I/O&quot; stream and <br>
then attaches the stream to a &quot;filehandle&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file test operator <br>
A built-in unary operator that you use to determine whether
something is &quot;true&quot; about a file, such as &quot;-o
$filename&quot; to test whether you&rsquo;re the owner of
the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fileglob <br>
A &quot;wildcard&quot; match on filenames. See the glob
function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">filehandle <br>
An identifier (not necessarily related to the real name of a
file) that represents a particular instance of opening a
file until you close it. If you&rsquo;re going to open and
<br>
close several different files in succession, it&rsquo;s fine
to open each of them with the same filehandle, so you
don&rsquo;t have to write out separate code to process each
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">filename <br>
One name for a file. This name is listed in a
&quot;directory&quot;, and you can use it in an open to tell
the &quot;operating system&quot; exactly which file you want
to open, and associate <br>
the file with a &quot;filehandle&quot; which will carry the
subsequent identity of that file in your program, until you
close it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">filesystem <br>
A set of directories and files residing on a partition of
the disk. Sometimes known as a &quot;partition&quot;. You
can change the file&rsquo;s name or even move a file around
from <br>
directory to directory within a filesystem without actually
moving the file itself, at least under Unix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">filter <br>
A program designed to take a &quot;stream&quot; of input and
transform it into a stream of output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">flag <br>
We tend to avoid this term because it means so many things.
It may mean a command-line &quot;switch&quot; that takes no
argument itself (such as Perl&rsquo;s -n and -p flags) or,
less <br>
frequently, a single-bit indicator (such as the
&quot;O_CREAT&quot; and &quot;O_EXCL&quot; flags used in
sysopen).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">floating point <br>
A method of storing numbers in &quot;scientific
notation&quot;, such that the precision of the number is
independent of its magnitude (the decimal point
&quot;floats&quot;). Perl does its <br>
numeric work with floating-point numbers (sometimes called
&quot;floats&quot;), when it can&rsquo;t get away with using
integers. Floating-point numbers are mere approximations of
real <br>
numbers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">flush <br>
The act of emptying a &quot;buffer&quot;, often before
it&rsquo;s full.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FMTEYEWTK <br>
Far More Than Everything You Ever Wanted To Know. An
exhaustive treatise on one narrow topic, something of a
super-&quot;FAQ&quot;. See Tom for far more.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fork <br>
To create a child &quot;process&quot; identical to the
parent process at its moment of conception, at least until
it gets ideas of its own. A thread with protected
memory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">formal arguments <br>
The generic names by which a &quot;subroutine&quot; knows
its arguments. In many languages, formal arguments are
always given individual names, but in Perl, the formal
arguments are <br>
just the elements of an array. The formal arguments to a
Perl program are $ARGV[0], $ARGV[1], and so on. Similarly,
the formal arguments to a Perl subroutine are $_[0], <br>
$_[1], and so on. You may give the arguments individual
names by assigning the values to a my list. See also
&quot;actual arguments&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">format <br>
A specification of how many spaces and digits and things to
put somewhere so that whatever you&rsquo;re printing comes
out nice and pretty.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">freely available <br>
Means you don&rsquo;t have to pay money to get it, but the
copyright on it may still belong to someone else (like
Larry).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">freely redistributable <br>
Means you&rsquo;re not in legal trouble if you give a
bootleg copy of it to your friends and we find out about it.
In fact, we&rsquo;d rather you gave a copy to all your
friends.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">freeware <br>
Historically, any software that you give away, particularly
if you make the source code available as well. Now often
called &quot;open source software&quot;. Recently there has
been <br>
a trend to use the term in contradistinction to &quot;open
source software&quot;, to refer only to free software
released under the Free Software Foundation&rsquo;s GPL
(General Public <br>
License), but this is difficult to justify
etymologically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">function <br>
Mathematically, a mapping of each of a set of input values
to a particular output value. In computers, refers to a
&quot;subroutine&quot; or &quot;operator&quot; that returns
a &quot;value&quot;. It may <br>
or may not have input values (called arguments).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">funny character <br>
Someone like Larry, or one of his peculiar friends. Also
refers to the strange prefixes that Perl requires as noun
markers on its variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">G <br>
garbage collection <br>
A misnamed feature--it should be called, &quot;expecting
your mother to pick up after you&quot;. Strictly speaking,
Perl doesn&rsquo;t do this, but it relies on a
reference-counting <br>
mechanism to keep things tidy. However, we rarely speak
strictly and will often refer to the reference-counting
scheme as a form of garbage collection. (If it&rsquo;s any
<br>
comfort, when your interpreter exits, a &quot;real&quot;
garbage collector runs to make sure everything is cleaned up
if you&rsquo;ve been messy with circular references and
such.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GID Group ID--in Unix, the
numeric group ID that the &quot;operating system&quot; uses
to identify you and members of your &quot;group&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">glob <br>
Strictly, the shell&rsquo;s &quot;*&quot; character, which
will match a &quot;glob&quot; of characters when
you&rsquo;re trying to generate a list of filenames.
Loosely, the act of using globs and similar <br>
symbols to do pattern matching. See also
&quot;fileglob&quot; and &quot;typeglob&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">global <br>
Something you can see from anywhere, usually used of
variables and subroutines that are visible everywhere in
your program. In Perl, only certain special variables are
truly <br>
global--most variables (and all subroutines) exist only in
the current &quot;package&quot;. Global variables can be
declared with our. See &quot;our&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">global destruction <br>
The &quot;garbage collection&quot; of globals (and the
running of any associated object destructors) that takes
place when a Perl &quot;interpreter&quot; is being shut
down. Global destruction <br>
should not be confused with the Apocalypse, except perhaps
when it should.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">glue language <br>
A language such as Perl that is good at hooking things
together that weren&rsquo;t intended to be hooked
together.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">granularity <br>
The size of the pieces you&rsquo;re dealing with, mentally
speaking.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">greedy <br>
A &quot;subpattern&quot; whose &quot;quantifier&quot; wants
to match as many things as possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">grep <br>
Originally from the old Unix editor command for
&quot;Globally search for a Regular Expression and Print
it&quot;, now used in the general sense of any kind of
search, especially text <br>
searches. Perl has a built-in grep function that searches a
list for elements matching any given criterion, whereas the
grep(1) program searches for lines matching a <br>
&quot;regular expression&quot; in one or more files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">group <br>
A set of users of which you are a member. In some operating
systems (like Unix), you can give certain file access
permissions to other members of your group.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GV An internal &quot;glob
value&quot; typedef, holding a &quot;typeglob&quot;. The
&quot;GV&quot; type is a subclass of &quot;SV&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">H <br>
hacker <br>
Someone who is brilliantly persistent in solving technical
problems, whether these involve golfing, fighting orcs, or
programming. Hacker is a neutral term, morally <br>
speaking. Good hackers are not to be confused with evil
crackers or clueless script kiddies. If you confuse them, we
will presume that you are either evil or clueless.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">handler <br>
A &quot;subroutine&quot; or &quot;method&quot; that is
called by Perl when your program needs to respond to some
internal event, such as a &quot;signal&quot;, or an
encounter with an operator subject to <br>
&quot;operator overloading&quot;. See also
&quot;callback&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hard reference <br>
A &quot;scalar&quot; &quot;value&quot; containing the actual
address of a &quot;referent&quot;, such that the
referent&rsquo;s &quot;reference&quot; count accounts for
it. (Some hard references are held internally, such <br>
as the implicit reference from one of a
&quot;typeglob&quot;&rsquo;s variable slots to its
corresponding referent.) A hard reference is different from
a &quot;symbolic reference&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hash <br>
An unordered association of
&quot;key&quot;/&quot;value&quot; pairs, stored such that
you can easily use a string &quot;key&quot; to look up its
associated data &quot;value&quot;. This glossary is like a
hash, <br>
where the word to be defined is the key, and the definition
is the value. A hash is also sometimes septisyllabically
called an &quot;associative array&quot;, which is a pretty
good <br>
reason for simply calling it a &quot;hash&quot; instead. A
hash can optionally be restricted to a fixed set of
keys.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hash table <br>
A data structure used internally by Perl for implementing
associative arrays (hashes) efficiently. See also
&quot;bucket&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">header file <br>
A file containing certain required definitions that you must
include &quot;ahead&quot; of the rest of your program to do
certain obscure operations. A C header file has a .h <br>
extension. Perl doesn&rsquo;t really have header files,
though historically Perl has sometimes used translated .h
files with a .ph extension. See &quot;require&quot; in
perlfunc. (Header <br>
files have been superseded by the &quot;module&quot;
mechanism.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">here document <br>
So called because of a similar construct in shells that
pretends that the lines following the &quot;command&quot;
are a separate &quot;file&quot; to be fed to the command, up
to some terminating <br>
string. In Perl, however, it&rsquo;s just a fancy form of
quoting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hexadecimal <br>
A number in base 16, &quot;hex&quot; for short. The digits
for 10 through 16 are customarily represented by the letters
&quot;a&quot; through &quot;f&quot;. Hexadecimal constants
in Perl start with <br>
&quot;0x&quot;. See also &quot;hex&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">home directory <br>
The directory you are put into when you log in. On a Unix
system, the name is often placed into $ENV{HOME} or
$ENV{LOGDIR} by login, but you can also find it with <br>
&quot;(getpwuid($&lt;))[7]&quot;. (Some platforms do not
have a concept of a home directory.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">host <br>
The computer on which a program or other data resides.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hubris <br>
Excessive pride, the sort of thing Zeus zaps you for. Also
the quality that makes you write (and maintain) programs
that other people won&rsquo;t want to say bad things about.
<br>
Hence, the third great virtue of a programmer. See also
&quot;laziness&quot; and &quot;impatience&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HV Short for a &quot;hash
value&quot; typedef, which holds Perl&rsquo;s internal
representation of a hash. The &quot;HV&quot; type is a
subclass of &quot;SV&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">I <br>
identifier <br>
A legally formed name for most anything in which a computer
program might be interested. Many languages (including Perl)
allow identifiers that start with a letter and <br>
contain letters and digits. Perl also counts the underscore
character as a valid letter. (Perl also has more complicated
names, such as &quot;qualified&quot; names.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">impatience <br>
The anger you feel when the computer is being lazy. This
makes you write programs that don&rsquo;t just react to your
needs, but actually anticipate them. Or at least that <br>
pretend to. Hence, the second great virtue of a programmer.
See also &quot;laziness&quot; and &quot;hubris&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">implementation <br>
How a piece of code actually goes about doing its job. Users
of the code should not count on implementation details
staying the same unless they are part of the published <br>
&quot;interface&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">import <br>
To gain access to symbols that are exported from another
module. See &quot;use&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">increment <br>
To increase the value of something by 1 (or by some other
number, if so specified).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">indexing <br>
In olden days, the act of looking up a &quot;key&quot; in an
actual index (such as a phone book), but now merely the act
of using any kind of key or position to find the
corresponding <br>
&quot;value&quot;, even if no index is involved. Things have
degenerated to the point that Perl&rsquo;s index function
merely locates the position (index) of one string in
another.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">indirect filehandle <br>
An &quot;expression&quot; that evaluates to something that
can be used as a &quot;filehandle&quot;: a
&quot;string&quot; (filehandle name), a
&quot;typeglob&quot;, a typeglob &quot;reference&quot;, or a
low-level &quot;IO&quot; <br>
object.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">indirect object <br>
In English grammar, a short noun phrase between a verb and
its direct object indicating the beneficiary or recipient of
the action. In Perl, &quot;print STDOUT &quot;$foo0;&quot;
can be <br>
understood as &quot;verb indirect-object object&quot; where
&quot;STDOUT&quot; is the recipient of the print action, and
&quot;$foo&quot; is the object being printed. Similarly,
when invoking a &quot;method&quot;, <br>
you might place the invocant between the method and its
arguments:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$gollum = new Pathetic::Creature
&quot;Smeagol&quot;; <br>
give $gollum &quot;Fisssssh!&quot;; <br>
give $gollum &quot;Precious!&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In modern Perl, calling methods
this way is often considered bad practice and to be
avoided.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">indirect object slot <br>
The syntactic position falling between a method call and its
arguments when using the indirect object invocation syntax.
(The slot is distinguished by the absence of a comma <br>
between it and the next argument.) &quot;STDERR&quot; is in
the indirect object slot here:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print STDERR &quot;Awake! Awake!
Fear, Fire, <br>
Foes! Awake!0;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">indirection <br>
If something in a program isn&rsquo;t the value you&rsquo;re
looking for but indicates where the value is, that&rsquo;s
indirection. This can be done with either symbolic
references or hard <br>
references.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">infix <br>
An &quot;operator&quot; that comes in between its operands,
such as multiplication in &quot;24 * 7&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">inheritance <br>
What you get from your ancestors, genetically or otherwise.
If you happen to be a &quot;class&quot;, your ancestors are
called base classes and your descendants are called derived
<br>
classes. See &quot;single inheritance&quot; and
&quot;multiple inheritance&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">instance <br>
Short for &quot;an instance of a class&quot;, meaning an
&quot;object&quot; of that &quot;class&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">instance variable <br>
An &quot;attribute&quot; of an &quot;object&quot;; data
stored with the particular object rather than with the class
as a whole.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">integer <br>
A number with no fractional (decimal) part. A counting
number, like 1, 2, 3, and so on, but including 0 and the
negatives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">interface <br>
The services a piece of code promises to provide forever, in
contrast to its &quot;implementation&quot;, which it should
feel free to change whenever it likes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">interpolation <br>
The insertion of a scalar or list value somewhere in the
middle of another value, such that it appears to have been
there all along. In Perl, variable interpolation happens
<br>
in double-quoted strings and patterns, and list
interpolation occurs when constructing the list of values to
pass to a list operator or other such construct that takes a
<br>
&quot;LIST&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">interpreter <br>
Strictly speaking, a program that reads a second program and
does what the second program says directly without turning
the program into a different form first, which is what <br>
compilers do. Perl is not an interpreter by this definition,
because it contains a kind of compiler that takes a program
and turns it into a more executable form (syntax <br>
trees) within the perl process itself, which the Perl
&quot;run time&quot; system then interprets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">invocant <br>
The agent on whose behalf a &quot;method&quot; is invoked.
In a &quot;class&quot; method, the invocant is a package
name. In an &quot;instance&quot; method, the invocant is an
object reference.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">invocation <br>
The act of calling up a deity, daemon, program, method,
subroutine, or function to get it do what you think
it&rsquo;s supposed to do. We usually &quot;call&quot;
subroutines but &quot;invoke&quot; <br>
methods, since it sounds cooler.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">I/O Input from, or output to, a
&quot;file&quot; or &quot;device&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IO An internal I/O object. Can
also mean &quot;indirect object&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IP Internet Protocol, or
Intellectual Property.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IPC Interprocess
Communication.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">is-a <br>
A relationship between two objects in which one object is
considered to be a more specific version of the other,
generic object: &quot;A camel is a mammal.&quot; Since the
generic <br>
object really only exists in a Platonic sense, we usually
add a little abstraction to the notion of objects and think
of the relationship as being between a generic &quot;base
<br>
class&quot; and a specific &quot;derived class&quot;. Oddly
enough, Platonic classes don&rsquo;t always have Platonic
relationships--see &quot;inheritance&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">iteration <br>
Doing something repeatedly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">iterator <br>
A special programming gizmo that keeps track of where you
are in something that you&rsquo;re trying to iterate over.
The &quot;foreach&quot; loop in Perl contains an iterator;
so does a <br>
hash, allowing you to each through it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IV The integer four, not to be
confused with six, Tom&rsquo;s favorite editor. IV also
means an internal Integer Value of the type a
&quot;scalar&quot; can hold, not to be confused with an <br>
&quot;NV&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">J <br>
JAPH <br>
&quot;Just Another Perl Hacker,&quot; a clever but cryptic
bit of Perl code that when executed, evaluates to that
string. Often used to illustrate a particular Perl feature,
and <br>
something of an ongoing Obfuscated Perl Contest seen in
Usenix signatures.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">K <br>
key The string index to a &quot;hash&quot;, used to look up
the &quot;value&quot; associated with that key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">keyword <br>
See &quot;reserved words&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">L <br>
label <br>
A name you give to a &quot;statement&quot; so that you can
talk about that statement elsewhere in the program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">laziness <br>
The quality that makes you go to great effort to reduce
overall energy expenditure. It makes you write labor-saving
programs that other people will find useful, and document
<br>
what you wrote so you don&rsquo;t have to answer so many
questions about it. Hence, the first great virtue of a
programmer. Also hence, this book. See also
&quot;impatience&quot; and <br>
&quot;hubris&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">left shift <br>
A &quot;bit shift&quot; that multiplies the number by some
power of 2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">leftmost longest <br>
The preference of the &quot;regular expression&quot; engine
to match the leftmost occurrence of a &quot;pattern&quot;,
then given a position at which a match will occur, the
preference for the <br>
longest match (presuming the use of a &quot;greedy&quot;
quantifier). See perlre for much more on this subject.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lexeme <br>
Fancy term for a &quot;token&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lexer <br>
Fancy term for a &quot;tokener&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lexical analysis <br>
Fancy term for &quot;tokenizing&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lexical scoping <br>
Looking at your Oxford English Dictionary through a
microscope. (Also known as &quot;static scoping&quot;,
because dictionaries don&rsquo;t change very fast.)
Similarly, looking at <br>
variables stored in a private dictionary (namespace) for
each scope, which are visible only from their point of
declaration down to the end of the lexical scope in which
they <br>
are declared. --Syn. &quot;static scoping&quot;. --Ant.
&quot;dynamic scoping&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lexical variable <br>
A &quot;variable&quot; subject to &quot;lexical
scoping&quot;, declared by my. Often just called a
&quot;lexical&quot;. (The our declaration declares a
lexically scoped name for a global variable, which <br>
is not itself a lexical variable.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">library <br>
Generally, a collection of procedures. In ancient days,
referred to a collection of subroutines in a .pl file. In
modern times, refers more often to the entire collection
<br>
of Perl modules on your system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LIFO <br>
Last In, First Out. See also &quot;FIFO&quot;. A LIFO is
usually called a &quot;stack&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">line <br>
In Unix, a sequence of zero or more non-newline characters
terminated with a &quot;newline&quot; character. On non-Unix
machines, this is emulated by the C library even if the <br>
underlying &quot;operating system&quot; has different
ideas.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">line buffering <br>
Used by a &quot;standard I/O&quot; output stream that
flushes its &quot;buffer&quot; after every
&quot;newline&quot;. Many standard I/O libraries
automatically set up line buffering on output that is <br>
going to the terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">line number <br>
The number of lines read previous to this one, plus 1. Perl
keeps a separate line number for each source or input file
it opens. The current source file&rsquo;s line number is
<br>
represented by &quot;__LINE__&quot;. The current input line
number (for the file that was most recently read via
&quot;&lt;FH&gt;&quot;) is represented by the $.
($INPUT_LINE_NUMBER) variable. Many <br>
error messages report both values, if available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">link <br>
Used as a noun, a name in a &quot;directory&quot;,
representing a &quot;file&quot;. A given file can have
multiple links to it. It&rsquo;s like having the same phone
number listed in the phone <br>
directory under different names. As a verb, to resolve a
partially compiled file&rsquo;s unresolved symbols into a
(nearly) executable image. Linking can generally be static
or <br>
dynamic, which has nothing to do with static or dynamic
scoping.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LIST <br>
A syntactic construct representing a comma-separated list of
expressions, evaluated to produce a &quot;list value&quot;.
Each &quot;expression&quot; in a &quot;LIST&quot; is
evaluated in &quot;list context&quot; <br>
and interpolated into the list value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list <br>
An ordered set of scalar values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list context <br>
The situation in which an &quot;expression&quot; is expected
by its surroundings (the code calling it) to return a list
of values rather than a single value. Functions that want a
<br>
&quot;LIST&quot; of arguments tell those arguments that they
should produce a list value. See also
&quot;context&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list operator <br>
An &quot;operator&quot; that does something with a list of
values, such as join or grep. Usually used for named
built-in operators (such as print, unlink, and system) that
do not <br>
require parentheses around their &quot;argument&quot;
list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list value <br>
An unnamed list of temporary scalar values that may be
passed around within a program from any list-generating
function to any function or construct that provides a
&quot;list <br>
context&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">literal <br>
A token in a programming language such as a number or
&quot;string&quot; that gives you an actual
&quot;value&quot; instead of merely representing possible
values as a &quot;variable&quot; does.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">little-endian <br>
From Swift: someone who eats eggs little end first. Also
used of computers that store the least significant
&quot;byte&quot; of a word at a lower byte address than the
most <br>
significant byte. Often considered superior to big-endian
machines. See also &quot;big-endian&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">local <br>
Not meaning the same thing everywhere. A global variable in
Perl can be localized inside a dynamic scope via the local
operator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">logical operator <br>
Symbols representing the concepts &quot;and&quot;,
&quot;or&quot;, &quot;xor&quot;, and &quot;not&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lookahead <br>
An &quot;assertion&quot; that peeks at the string to the
right of the current match location.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lookbehind <br>
An &quot;assertion&quot; that peeks at the string to the
left of the current match location.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">loop <br>
A construct that performs something repeatedly, like a
roller coaster.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">loop control statement <br>
Any statement within the body of a loop that can make a loop
prematurely stop looping or skip an &quot;iteration&quot;.
Generally you shouldn&rsquo;t try this on roller
coasters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">loop label <br>
A kind of key or name attached to a loop (or roller coaster)
so that loop control statements can talk about which loop
they want to control.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lvaluable <br>
Able to serve as an &quot;lvalue&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lvalue <br>
Term used by language lawyers for a storage location you can
assign a new &quot;value&quot; to, such as a
&quot;variable&quot; or an element of an &quot;array&quot;.
The &quot;l&quot; is short for &quot;left&quot;, as in <br>
the left side of an assignment, a typical place for lvalues.
An &quot;lvaluable&quot; function or expression is one to
which a value may be assigned, as in &quot;pos($x) =
10&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lvalue modifier <br>
An adjectival pseudofunction that warps the meaning of an
&quot;lvalue&quot; in some declarative fashion. Currently
there are three lvalue modifiers: my, our, and local.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">M <br>
magic <br>
Technically speaking, any extra semantics attached to a
variable such as $!, $0, %ENV, or %SIG, or to any tied
variable. Magical things happen when you diddle those <br>
variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">magical increment <br>
An &quot;increment&quot; operator that knows how to bump up
alphabetics as well as numbers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">magical variables <br>
Special variables that have side effects when you access
them or assign to them. For example, in Perl, changing
elements of the %ENV array also changes the corresponding
<br>
environment variables that subprocesses will use. Reading
the $! variable gives you the current system error number or
message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Makefile <br>
A file that controls the compilation of a program. Perl
programs don&rsquo;t usually need a &quot;Makefile&quot;
because the Perl compiler has plenty of self-control.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">man The Unix program that
displays online documentation (manual pages) for you.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">manpage <br>
A &quot;page&quot; from the manuals, typically accessed via
the man(1) command. A manpage contains a SYNOPSIS, a
DESCRIPTION, a list of BUGS, and so on, and is typically
longer than a <br>
page. There are manpages documenting commands, syscalls,
&quot;library&quot; functions, devices, protocols, files,
and such. In this book, we call any piece of standard Perl
<br>
documentation (like perlop or perldelta) a manpage, no
matter what format it&rsquo;s installed in on your
system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">matching <br>
See &quot;pattern matching&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">member data <br>
See &quot;instance variable&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">memory <br>
This always means your main memory, not your disk. Clouding
the issue is the fact that your machine may implement
&quot;virtual&quot; memory; that is, it will pretend that it
has more <br>
memory than it really does, and it&rsquo;ll use disk space
to hold inactive bits. This can make it seem like you have a
little more memory than you really do, but it&rsquo;s not a
<br>
substitute for real memory. The best thing that can be said
about virtual memory is that it lets your performance
degrade gradually rather than suddenly when you run out of
<br>
real memory. But your program can die when you run out of
virtual memory too, if you haven&rsquo;t thrashed your disk
to death first.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">metacharacter <br>
A &quot;character&quot; that is not supposed to be treated
normally. Which characters are to be treated specially as
metacharacters varies greatly from context to context. Your
<br>
&quot;shell&quot; will have certain metacharacters,
double-quoted Perl strings have other metacharacters, and
&quot;regular expression&quot; patterns have all the
double-quote metacharacters <br>
plus some extra ones of their own.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">metasymbol <br>
Something we&rsquo;d call a &quot;metacharacter&quot; except
that it&rsquo;s a sequence of more than one character.
Generally, the first character in the sequence must be a
true metacharacter to <br>
get the other characters in the metasymbol to misbehave
along with it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">method <br>
A kind of action that an &quot;object&quot; can take if you
tell it to. See perlobj.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">minimalism <br>
The belief that &quot;small is beautiful.&quot;
Paradoxically, if you say something in a small language, it
turns out big, and if you say it in a big language, it turns
out small. Go <br>
figure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mode <br>
In the context of the stat(2) syscall, refers to the field
holding the &quot;permission bits&quot; and the type of the
&quot;file&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">modifier <br>
See &quot;statement modifier&quot;, &quot;regular expression
modifier&quot;, and &quot;lvalue modifier&quot;, not
necessarily in that order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">module <br>
A &quot;file&quot; that defines a &quot;package&quot; of
(almost) the same name, which can either &quot;export&quot;
symbols or function as an &quot;object&quot; class. (A
module&rsquo;s main .pm file may also load in <br>
other files in support of the module.) See the use
built-in.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">modulus <br>
An integer divisor when you&rsquo;re interested in the
remainder instead of the quotient.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">monger <br>
Short for Perl Monger, a purveyor of Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mortal <br>
A temporary value scheduled to die when the current
statement finishes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">multidimensional array <br>
An array with multiple subscripts for finding a single
element. Perl implements these using references--see perllol
and perldsc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">multiple inheritance <br>
The features you got from your mother and father, mixed
together unpredictably. (See also &quot;inheritance&quot;,
and &quot;single inheritance&quot;.) In computer languages
(including Perl), <br>
the notion that a given class may have multiple direct
ancestors or base classes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">N <br>
named pipe <br>
A &quot;pipe&quot; with a name embedded in the
&quot;filesystem&quot; so that it can be accessed by two
unrelated processes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">namespace <br>
A domain of names. You needn&rsquo;t worry about whether the
names in one such domain have been used in another. See
&quot;package&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">network address <br>
The most important attribute of a socket, like your
telephone&rsquo;s telephone number. Typically an IP address.
See also &quot;port&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">newline <br>
A single character that represents the end of a line, with
the ASCII value of 012 octal under Unix (but 015 on a Mac),
and represented by &quot;0 in Perl strings. For Windows <br>
machines writing text files, and for certain physical
devices like terminals, the single newline gets
automatically translated by your C library into a line feed
and a <br>
carriage return, but normally, no translation is done.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NFS Network File System, which
allows you to mount a remote filesystem as if it were
local.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">null character <br>
A character with the ASCII value of zero. It&rsquo;s used by
C to terminate strings, but Perl allows strings to contain a
null.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">null list <br>
A valueless value represented in Perl by &quot;()&quot;. It
is not really a &quot;LIST&quot;, but an expression that
yields &quot;undef&quot; in &quot;scalar context&quot; and a
&quot;list value&quot; with zero elements in <br>
&quot;list context&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">null string <br>
A &quot;string&quot; containing no characters, not to be
confused with a string containing a &quot;null
character&quot;, which has a positive length and is
&quot;true&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">numeric context <br>
The situation in which an expression is expected by its
surroundings (the code calling it) to return a number. See
also &quot;context&quot; and &quot;string context&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NV Short for Nevada, no part of
which will ever be confused with civilization. NV also means
an internal floating-point Numeric Value of the type a
&quot;scalar&quot; can hold, not to be <br>
confused with an &quot;IV&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nybble <br>
Half a &quot;byte&quot;, equivalent to one
&quot;hexadecimal&quot; digit, and worth four bits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">O <br>
object <br>
An &quot;instance&quot; of a &quot;class&quot;. Something
that &quot;knows&quot; what user-defined type (class) it is,
and what it can do because of what class it is. Your program
can request an object <br>
to do things, but the object gets to decide whether it wants
to do them or not. Some objects are more accommodating than
others.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">octal <br>
A number in base 8. Only the digits 0 through 7 are allowed.
Octal constants in Perl start with 0, as in 013. See also
the oct function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">offset <br>
How many things you have to skip over when moving from the
beginning of a string or array to a specific position within
it. Thus, the minimum offset is zero, not one, <br>
because you don&rsquo;t skip anything to get to the first
item.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">one-liner <br>
An entire computer program crammed into one line of
text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">open source software <br>
Programs for which the source code is freely available and
freely redistributable, with no commercial strings attached.
For a more detailed definition, see <br>
&lt;http://www.opensource.org/osd.html&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">operand <br>
An &quot;expression&quot; that yields a &quot;value&quot;
that an &quot;operator&quot; operates on. See also
&quot;precedence&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">operating system <br>
A special program that runs on the bare machine and hides
the gory details of managing processes and devices. Usually
used in a looser sense to indicate a particular culture <br>
of programming. The loose sense can be used at varying
levels of specificity. At one extreme, you might say that
all versions of Unix and Unix-lookalikes are the same <br>
operating system (upsetting many people, especially lawyers
and other advocates). At the other extreme, you could say
this particular version of this particular vendor&rsquo;s
<br>
operating system is different from any other version of this
or any other vendor&rsquo;s operating system. Perl is much
more portable across operating systems than many other <br>
languages. See also &quot;architecture&quot; and
&quot;platform&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">operator <br>
A gizmo that transforms some number of input values to some
number of output values, often built into a language with a
special syntax or symbol. A given operator may have <br>
specific expectations about what types of data you give as
its arguments (operands) and what type of data you want back
from it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">operator overloading <br>
A kind of &quot;overloading&quot; that you can do on
built-in operators to make them work on objects as if the
objects were ordinary scalar values, but with the actual
semantics <br>
supplied by the object class. This is set up with the
overload &quot;pragma&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">options <br>
See either switches or &quot;regular expression
modifier&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ordinal <br>
Another name for &quot;code point&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">overloading <br>
Giving additional meanings to a symbol or construct.
Actually, all languages do overloading to one extent or
another, since people are good at figuring out things from
<br>
&quot;context&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">overriding <br>
Hiding or invalidating some other definition of the same
name. (Not to be confused with &quot;overloading&quot;,
which adds definitions that must be disambiguated some other
way.) To <br>
confuse the issue further, we use the word with two
overloaded definitions: to describe how you can define your
own &quot;subroutine&quot; to hide a built-in
&quot;function&quot; of the same <br>
name (see &quot;Overriding Built-in Functions&quot; in
perlsub) and to describe how you can define a replacement
&quot;method&quot; in a &quot;derived class&quot; to hide a
&quot;base class&quot;&rsquo;s method of the <br>
same name (see perlobj).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">owner <br>
The one user (apart from the superuser) who has absolute
control over a &quot;file&quot;. A file may also have a
&quot;group&quot; of users who may exercise joint ownership
if the real owner <br>
permits it. See &quot;permission bits&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">P <br>
package <br>
A &quot;namespace&quot; for global variables, subroutines,
and the like, such that they can be kept separate from
like-named symbols in other namespaces. In a sense, only the
package <br>
is global, since the symbols in the package&rsquo;s symbol
table are only accessible from code compiled outside the
package by naming the package. But in another sense, all
<br>
package symbols are also globals--they&rsquo;re just
well-organized globals.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pad Short for
&quot;scratchpad&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">parameter <br>
See &quot;argument&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">parent class <br>
See &quot;base class&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">parse tree <br>
See &quot;syntax tree&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">parsing <br>
The subtle but sometimes brutal art of attempting to turn
your possibly malformed program into a valid &quot;syntax
tree&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">patch <br>
To fix by applying one, as it were. In the realm of
hackerdom, a listing of the differences between two versions
of a program as might be applied by the patch(1) program
<br>
when you want to fix a bug or upgrade your old version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PATH <br>
The list of directories the system searches to find a
program you want to &quot;execute&quot;. The list is stored
as one of your environment variables, accessible in Perl as
<br>
$ENV{PATH}.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pathname <br>
A fully qualified filename such as /usr/bin/perl. Sometimes
confused with &quot;PATH&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pattern <br>
A template used in &quot;pattern matching&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pattern matching <br>
Taking a pattern, usually a &quot;regular expression&quot;,
and trying the pattern various ways on a string to see
whether there&rsquo;s any way to make it fit. Often used to
pick <br>
interesting tidbits out of a file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">permission bits <br>
Bits that the &quot;owner&quot; of a file sets or unsets to
allow or disallow access to other people. These flag bits
are part of the &quot;mode&quot; word returned by the stat
built-in when <br>
you ask about a file. On Unix systems, you can check the
ls(1) manpage for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pern <br>
What you get when you do &quot;Perl++&quot; twice. Doing it
only once will curl your hair. You have to increment it
eight times to shampoo your hair. Lather, rinse,
iterate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pipe <br>
A direct &quot;connection&quot; that carries the output of
one &quot;process&quot; to the input of another without an
intermediate temporary file. Once the pipe is set up, the
two processes in <br>
question can read and write as if they were talking to a
normal file, with some caveats.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pipeline <br>
A series of processes all in a row, linked by pipes, where
each passes its output stream to the next.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">platform <br>
The entire hardware and software context in which a program
runs. A <br>
program written in a platform-dependent language might break
if you change any of: machine, operating system, libraries,
compiler, or system configuration. The perl <br>
interpreter has to be compiled differently for each platform
because it is implemented in C, but programs written in the
Perl language are largely platform-independent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pod The markup used to embed
documentation into your Perl code. See perlpod.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pointer <br>
A &quot;variable&quot; in a language like C that contains
the exact memory location of some other item. Perl handles
pointers internally so you don&rsquo;t have to worry about
them. <br>
Instead, you just use symbolic pointers in the form of keys
and &quot;variable&quot; names, or hard references, which
aren&rsquo;t pointers (but act like pointers and do in fact
contain <br>
pointers).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">polymorphism <br>
The notion that you can tell an &quot;object&quot; to do
something generic, and the object will interpret the command
in different ways depending on its type. [&lt;Gk many
shapes]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">port <br>
The part of the address of a TCP or UDP socket that directs
packets to the correct process after finding the right
machine, something like the phone extension you give when
<br>
you reach the company operator. Also, the result of
converting code to run on a different platform than
originally intended, or the verb denoting this
conversion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">portable <br>
Once upon a time, C code compilable under both BSD and SysV.
In general, code that can be easily converted to run on
another &quot;platform&quot;, where &quot;easily&quot; can
be defined <br>
however you like, and usually is. Anything may be considered
portable if you try hard enough. See mobile home or London
Bridge.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">porter <br>
Someone who &quot;carries&quot; software from one
&quot;platform&quot; to another. Porting programs written in
platform-dependent languages such as C can be difficult
work, but porting programs <br>
like Perl is very much worth the agony.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">POSIX <br>
The Portable Operating System Interface specification.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">postfix <br>
An &quot;operator&quot; that follows its
&quot;operand&quot;, as in &quot;$x++&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pp An internal shorthand for a
&quot;push-pop&quot; code, that is, C code implementing
Perl&rsquo;s stack machine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pragma <br>
A standard module whose practical hints and suggestions are
received (and possibly ignored) at compile time. Pragmas are
named in all lowercase.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">precedence <br>
The rules of conduct that, in the absence of other guidance,
determine what should happen first. For example, in the
absence of parentheses, you always do multiplication <br>
before addition.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">prefix <br>
An &quot;operator&quot; that precedes its
&quot;operand&quot;, as in &quot;++$x&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">preprocessing <br>
What some helper &quot;process&quot; did to transform the
incoming data into a form more suitable for the current
process. Often done with an incoming &quot;pipe&quot;. See
also &quot;C <br>
preprocessor&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">procedure <br>
A &quot;subroutine&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">process <br>
An instance of a running program. Under multitasking systems
like Unix, two or more separate processes could be running
the same program independently at the same time--in <br>
fact, the fork function is designed to bring about this
happy state of affairs. Under other operating systems,
processes are sometimes called &quot;threads&quot;,
&quot;tasks&quot;, or &quot;jobs&quot;, <br>
often with slight nuances in meaning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">program generator <br>
A system that algorithmically writes code for you in a
high-level language. See also &quot;code
generator&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">progressive matching <br>
Pattern matching that picks up where it left off before.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">property <br>
See either &quot;instance variable&quot; or &quot;character
property&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">protocol <br>
In networking, an agreed-upon way of sending messages back
and forth so that neither correspondent will get too
confused.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">prototype <br>
An optional part of a &quot;subroutine&quot; declaration
telling the Perl compiler how many and what flavor of
arguments may be passed as &quot;actual arguments&quot;, so
that you can write <br>
subroutine calls that parse much like built-in functions.
(Or don&rsquo;t parse, as the case may be.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pseudofunction <br>
A construct that sometimes looks like a function but really
isn&rsquo;t. Usually reserved for &quot;lvalue&quot;
modifiers like my, for &quot;context&quot; modifiers like
scalar, and for the pick- <br>
your-own-quotes constructs, &quot;q//&quot;,
&quot;qq//&quot;, &quot;qx//&quot;, &quot;qw//&quot;,
&quot;qr//&quot;, &quot;m//&quot;, &quot;s///&quot;,
&quot;y///&quot;, and &quot;tr///&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pseudohash <br>
A reference to an array whose initial element happens to
hold a reference to a hash. You can treat a pseudohash
reference as either an array reference or a hash
reference.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pseudoliteral <br>
An &quot;operator&quot; that looks something like a
&quot;literal&quot;, such as the output-grabbing operator,
&quot;&lsquo;&quot;&quot;command&quot;&quot;&lsquo;&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">public domain <br>
Something not owned by anybody. Perl is copyrighted and is
thus not in the public domain--it&rsquo;s just &quot;freely
available&quot; and &quot;freely redistributable&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pumpkin <br>
A notional &quot;baton&quot; handed around the Perl
community indicating who is the lead integrator in some
arena of development.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pumpking <br>
A &quot;pumpkin&quot; holder, the person in charge of
pumping the pump, or at least priming it. Must be willing to
play the part of the Great Pumpkin now and then.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PV A &quot;pointer value&quot;,
which is Perl Internals Talk for a &quot;char*&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Q <br>
qualified <br>
Possessing a complete name. The symbol $Ent::moot is
qualified; $moot is unqualified. A fully qualified filename
is specified from the top-level directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">quantifier <br>
A component of a &quot;regular expression&quot; specifying
how many times the foregoing &quot;atom&quot; may occur.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">R <br>
readable <br>
With respect to files, one that has the proper permission
bit set to let you access the file. With respect to computer
programs, one that&rsquo;s written well enough that someone
<br>
has a chance of figuring out what it&rsquo;s trying to
do.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reaping <br>
The last rites performed by a parent &quot;process&quot; on
behalf of a deceased child process so that it doesn&rsquo;t
remain a &quot;zombie&quot;. See the wait and waitpid
function calls.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">record <br>
A set of related data values in a &quot;file&quot; or
&quot;stream&quot;, often associated with a unique
&quot;key&quot; field. In Unix, often commensurate with a
&quot;line&quot;, or a blank-line-terminated set <br>
of lines (a &quot;paragraph&quot;). Each line of the
/etc/passwd file is a record, keyed on login name,
containing information about that user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">recursion <br>
The art of defining something (at least partly) in terms of
itself, which is a naughty no-no in dictionaries but often
works out okay in computer programs if you&rsquo;re careful
<br>
not to recurse forever, which is like an infinite loop with
more spectacular failure modes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reference <br>
Where you look to find a pointer to information somewhere
else. (See &quot;indirection&quot;.) References come in two
flavors, symbolic references and hard references.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">referent <br>
Whatever a reference refers to, which may or may not have a
name. Common types of referents include scalars, arrays,
hashes, and subroutines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">regex <br>
See &quot;regular expression&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">regular expression <br>
A single entity with various interpretations, like an
elephant. To a computer scientist, it&rsquo;s a grammar for
a little language in which some strings are legal and others
<br>
aren&rsquo;t. To normal people, it&rsquo;s a pattern you can
use to find what you&rsquo;re looking for when it varies
from case to case. Perl&rsquo;s regular expressions are far
from regular in <br>
the theoretical sense, but in regular use they work quite
well. Here&rsquo;s a regular expression: &quot;/Oh
s.*t./&quot;. This will match strings like &quot;&quot;Oh
say can you see by the dawn&rsquo;s <br>
early light&quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;Oh sit!&quot;&quot;.
See perlre.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">regular expression modifier <br>
An option on a pattern or substitution, such as
&quot;/i&quot; to render the pattern case insensitive. See
also &quot;cloister&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">regular file <br>
A &quot;file&quot; that&rsquo;s not a &quot;directory&quot;,
a &quot;device&quot;, a named &quot;pipe&quot; or
&quot;socket&quot;, or a &quot;symbolic link&quot;. Perl
uses the &quot;-f&quot; file test operator to identify
regular files. Sometimes <br>
called a &quot;plain&quot; file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">relational operator <br>
An &quot;operator&quot; that says whether a particular
ordering relationship is &quot;true&quot; about a pair of
operands. Perl has both numeric and string relational
operators. See &quot;collating <br>
sequence&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reserved words <br>
A word with a specific, built-in meaning to a
&quot;compiler&quot;, such as &quot;if&quot; or delete. In
many languages (not Perl), it&rsquo;s illegal to use
reserved words to name anything else. <br>
(Which is why they&rsquo;re reserved, after all.) In Perl,
you just can&rsquo;t use them to name labels or filehandles.
Also called &quot;keywords&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">restricted hash <br>
A &quot;hash&quot; with a closed set of allowed keys. See
Hash::Util.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">return value <br>
The &quot;value&quot; produced by a &quot;subroutine&quot;
or &quot;expression&quot; when evaluated. In Perl, a return
value may be either a &quot;list&quot; or a
&quot;scalar&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RFC Request For Comment, which
despite the timid connotations is the name of a series of
important standards documents.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">right shift <br>
A &quot;bit shift&quot; that divides a number by some power
of 2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">root <br>
The superuser (UID == 0). Also, the top-level directory of
the filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RTFM <br>
What you are told when someone thinks you should Read The
Fine Manual.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">run phase <br>
Any time after Perl starts running your main program. See
also &quot;compile phase&quot;. Run phase is mostly spent in
&quot;run time&quot; but may also be spent in &quot;compile
time&quot; when <br>
require, do &quot;FILE&quot;, or eval &quot;STRING&quot;
operators are executed or when a substitution uses the
&quot;/ee&quot; modifier.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">run time <br>
The time when Perl is actually doing what your code says to
do, as opposed to the earlier period of time when it was
trying to figure out whether what you said made any sense
<br>
whatsoever, which is &quot;compile time&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">run-time pattern <br>
A pattern that contains one or more variables to be
interpolated before parsing the pattern as a &quot;regular
expression&quot;, and that therefore cannot be analyzed at
compile time, <br>
but must be re-analyzed each time the pattern match operator
is evaluated. Run-time patterns are useful but
expensive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RV A recreational vehicle, not
to be confused with vehicular recreation. RV also means an
internal Reference Value of the type a &quot;scalar&quot;
can hold. See also &quot;IV&quot; and &quot;NV&quot; if <br>
you&rsquo;re not confused yet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rvalue <br>
A &quot;value&quot; that you might find on the right side of
an &quot;assignment&quot;. See also &quot;lvalue&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">S <br>
scalar <br>
A simple, singular value; a number, &quot;string&quot;, or
&quot;reference&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">scalar context <br>
The situation in which an &quot;expression&quot; is expected
by its surroundings (the code calling it) to return a single
&quot;value&quot; rather than a &quot;list&quot; of values.
See also &quot;context&quot; <br>
and &quot;list context&quot;. A scalar context sometimes
imposes additional constraints on the return value--see
&quot;string context&quot; and &quot;numeric context&quot;.
Sometimes we talk about a <br>
&quot;Boolean context&quot; inside conditionals, but this
imposes no additional constraints, since any scalar value,
whether numeric or &quot;string&quot;, is already true or
false.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">scalar literal <br>
A number or quoted &quot;string&quot;--an actual
&quot;value&quot; in the text of your program, as opposed to
a &quot;variable&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">scalar value <br>
A value that happens to be a &quot;scalar&quot; as opposed
to a &quot;list&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">scalar variable <br>
A &quot;variable&quot; prefixed with &quot;$&quot; that
holds a single value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">scope <br>
How far away you can see a variable from, looking through
one. Perl has two visibility mechanisms: it does
&quot;dynamic scoping&quot; of local variables, meaning that
the rest of the <br>
&quot;block&quot;, and any subroutines that are called by
the rest of the block, can see the variables that are local
to the block. Perl does &quot;lexical scoping&quot; of my
variables, <br>
meaning that the rest of the block can see the variable, but
other subroutines called by the block cannot see the
variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">scratchpad <br>
The area in which a particular invocation of a particular
file or subroutine keeps some of its temporary values,
including any lexically scoped variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">script <br>
A text &quot;file&quot; that is a program intended to be
executed directly rather than compiled to another form of
file before execution. Also, in the context of
&quot;Unicode&quot;, a writing <br>
system for a particular language or group of languages, such
as Greek, Bengali, or Klingon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">script kiddie <br>
A &quot;cracker&quot; who is not a &quot;hacker&quot;, but
knows just enough to run canned scripts. A cargo-cult
programmer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sed A venerable Stream EDitor
from which Perl derives some of its ideas.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">semaphore <br>
A fancy kind of interlock that prevents multiple threads or
processes from using up the same resources
simultaneously.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">separator <br>
A &quot;character&quot; or &quot;string&quot; that keeps two
surrounding strings from being confused with each other. The
split function works on separators. Not to be confused with
delimiters <br>
or terminators. The &quot;or&quot; in the previous sentence
separated the two alternatives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">serialization <br>
Putting a fancy &quot;data structure&quot; into linear order
so that it can be stored as a &quot;string&quot; in a disk
file or database or sent through a &quot;pipe&quot;. Also
called marshalling.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">server <br>
In networking, a &quot;process&quot; that either advertises
a &quot;service&quot; or just hangs around at a known
location and waits for clients who need service to get in
touch with it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">service <br>
Something you do for someone else to make them happy, like
giving them the time of day (or of their life). On some
machines, well-known services are listed by the getservent
<br>
function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">setgid <br>
Same as &quot;setuid&quot;, only having to do with giving
away &quot;group&quot; privileges.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">setuid <br>
Said of a program that runs with the privileges of its
&quot;owner&quot; rather than (as is usually the case) the
privileges of whoever is running it. Also describes the bit
in the <br>
mode word (&quot;permission bits&quot;) that controls the
feature. This bit must be explicitly set by the owner to
enable this feature, and the program must be carefully
written not <br>
to give away more privileges than it ought to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">shared memory <br>
A piece of &quot;memory&quot; accessible by two different
processes who otherwise would not see each other&rsquo;s
memory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">shebang <br>
Irish for the whole McGillicuddy. In Perl culture, a
portmanteau of &quot;sharp&quot; and &quot;bang&quot;,
meaning the &quot;#!&quot; sequence that tells the system
where to find the interpreter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">shell <br>
A &quot;command&quot;-line &quot;interpreter&quot;. The
program that interactively gives you a prompt, accepts one
or more lines of input, and executes the programs you
mentioned, feeding each <br>
of them their proper arguments and input data. Shells can
also execute scripts containing such commands. Under Unix,
typical shells include the Bourne shell (/bin/sh), the <br>
C shell (/bin/csh), and the Korn shell (/bin/ksh). Perl is
not strictly a shell because it&rsquo;s not interactive
(although Perl programs can be interactive).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">side effects <br>
Something extra that happens when you evaluate an
&quot;expression&quot;. Nowadays it can refer to almost
anything. For example, evaluating a simple assignment
statement typically <br>
has the &quot;side effect&quot; of assigning a value to a
variable. (And you thought assigning the value was your
primary intent in the first place!) Likewise, assigning a
value to <br>
the special variable $| ($AUTOFLUSH) has the side effect of
forcing a flush after every write or print on the currently
selected filehandle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">signal <br>
A bolt out of the blue; that is, an event triggered by the
&quot;operating system&quot;, probably when you&rsquo;re
least expecting it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">signal handler <br>
A &quot;subroutine&quot; that, instead of being content to
be called in the normal fashion, sits around waiting for a
bolt out of the blue before it will deign to
&quot;execute&quot;. Under <br>
Perl, bolts out of the blue are called signals, and you send
them with the kill built-in. See &quot;%SIG&quot; in perlvar
and &quot;Signals&quot; in perlipc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">single inheritance <br>
The features you got from your mother, if she told you that
you don&rsquo;t have a father. (See also
&quot;inheritance&quot; and &quot;multiple
inheritance&quot;.) In computer languages, the notion <br>
that classes reproduce asexually so that a given class can
only have one direct ancestor or &quot;base class&quot;.
Perl supplies no such restriction, though you may certainly
program <br>
Perl that way if you like.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">slice <br>
A selection of any number of elements from a
&quot;list&quot;, &quot;array&quot;, or
&quot;hash&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">slurp <br>
To read an entire &quot;file&quot; into a &quot;string&quot;
in one operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">socket <br>
An endpoint for network communication among multiple
processes that works much like a telephone or a post office
box. The most important thing about a socket is its
&quot;network <br>
address&quot; (like a phone number). Different kinds of
sockets have different kinds of addresses--some look like
filenames, and some don&rsquo;t.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">soft reference <br>
See &quot;symbolic reference&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">source filter <br>
A special kind of &quot;module&quot; that does
&quot;preprocessing&quot; on your script just before it gets
to the &quot;tokener&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">stack <br>
A device you can put things on the top of, and later take
them back off in the opposite order in which you put them
on. See &quot;LIFO&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">standard <br>
Included in the official Perl distribution, as in a standard
module, a standard tool, or a standard Perl
&quot;manpage&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">standard error <br>
The default output &quot;stream&quot; for nasty remarks that
don&rsquo;t belong in &quot;standard output&quot;.
Represented within a Perl program by the
&quot;filehandle&quot; &quot;STDERR&quot;. You can use this
<br>
stream explicitly, but the die and warn built-ins write to
your standard error stream automatically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">standard I/O <br>
A standard C library for doing buffered input and output to
the &quot;operating system&quot;. (The &quot;standard&quot;
of standard I/O is only marginally related to the
&quot;standard&quot; of standard <br>
input and output.) In general, Perl relies on whatever
implementation of standard I/O a given operating system
supplies, so the buffering characteristics of a Perl program
<br>
on one machine may not exactly match those on another
machine. Normally this only influences efficiency, not
semantics. If your standard I/O package is doing block <br>
buffering and you want it to &quot;flush&quot; the buffer
more often, just set the $| variable to a true value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">standard input <br>
The default input &quot;stream&quot; for your program, which
if possible shouldn&rsquo;t care where its data is coming
from. Represented within a Perl program by the
&quot;filehandle&quot; &quot;STDIN&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">standard output <br>
The default output &quot;stream&quot; for your program,
which if possible shouldn&rsquo;t care where its data is
going. Represented within a Perl program by the
&quot;filehandle&quot; &quot;STDOUT&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">stat structure <br>
A special internal spot in which Perl keeps the information
about the last &quot;file&quot; on which you requested
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">statement <br>
A &quot;command&quot; to the computer about what to do next,
like a step in a recipe: &quot;Add marmalade to batter and
mix until mixed.&quot; A statement is distinguished from a
&quot;declaration&quot;, <br>
which doesn&rsquo;t tell the computer to do anything, but
just to learn something.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">statement modifier <br>
A &quot;conditional&quot; or &quot;loop&quot; that you put
after the &quot;statement&quot; instead of before, if you
know what we mean.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">static <br>
Varying slowly compared to something else. (Unfortunately,
everything is relatively stable compared to something else,
except for certain elementary particles, and we&rsquo;re not
<br>
so sure about them.) In computers, where things are supposed
to vary rapidly, &quot;static&quot; has a derogatory
connotation, indicating a slightly dysfunctional
&quot;variable&quot;, <br>
&quot;subroutine&quot;, or &quot;method&quot;. In Perl
culture, the word is politely avoided.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">static method <br>
No such thing. See &quot;class method&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">static scoping <br>
No such thing. See &quot;lexical scoping&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">static variable <br>
No such thing. Just use a &quot;lexical variable&quot; in a
scope larger than your &quot;subroutine&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">status <br>
The &quot;value&quot; returned to the parent
&quot;process&quot; when one of its child processes dies.
This value is placed in the special variable $?. Its upper
eight bits are the exit status <br>
of the defunct process, and its lower eight bits identify
the signal (if any) that the process died from. On Unix
systems, this status value is the same as the status word
<br>
returned by wait(2). See &quot;system&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDERR <br>
See &quot;standard error&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDIN <br>
See &quot;standard input&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDIO <br>
See &quot;standard I/O&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDOUT <br>
See &quot;standard output&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">stream <br>
A flow of data into or out of a process as a steady sequence
of bytes or characters, without the appearance of being
broken up into packets. This is a kind of <br>
&quot;interface&quot;--the underlying
&quot;implementation&quot; may well break your data up into
separate packets for delivery, but this is hidden from
you.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">string <br>
A sequence of characters such as &quot;He said
!@#*&amp;%@#*?!&quot;. A string does not have to be entirely
printable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">string context <br>
The situation in which an expression is expected by its
surroundings (the code calling it) to return a
&quot;string&quot;. See also &quot;context&quot; and
&quot;numeric context&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">stringification <br>
The process of producing a &quot;string&quot; representation
of an abstract object.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">struct <br>
C keyword introducing a structure definition or name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">structure <br>
See &quot;data structure&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">subclass <br>
See &quot;derived class&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">subpattern <br>
A component of a &quot;regular expression&quot; pattern.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">subroutine <br>
A named or otherwise accessible piece of program that can be
invoked from elsewhere in the program in order to accomplish
some sub-goal of the program. A subroutine is often <br>
parameterized to accomplish different but related things
depending on its input arguments. If the subroutine returns
a meaningful &quot;value&quot;, it is also called a
&quot;function&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">subscript <br>
A &quot;value&quot; that indicates the position of a
particular &quot;array&quot; &quot;element&quot; in an
array.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">substitution <br>
Changing parts of a string via the &quot;s///&quot;
operator. (We avoid use of this term to mean &quot;variable
interpolation&quot;.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">substring <br>
A portion of a &quot;string&quot;, starting at a certain
&quot;character&quot; position (&quot;offset&quot;) and
proceeding for a certain number of characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">superclass <br>
See &quot;base class&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">superuser <br>
The person whom the &quot;operating system&quot; will let do
almost anything. Typically your system administrator or
someone pretending to be your system administrator. On Unix
<br>
systems, the &quot;root&quot; user. On Windows systems,
usually the Administrator user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SV Short for &quot;scalar
value&quot;. But within the Perl interpreter every
&quot;referent&quot; is treated as a member of a class
derived from SV, in an object-oriented sort of way. Every
<br>
&quot;value&quot; inside Perl is passed around as a C
language &quot;SV*&quot; pointer. The SV &quot;struct&quot;
knows its own &quot;referent type&quot;, and the code is
smart enough (we hope) not to try to call <br>
a &quot;hash&quot; function on a &quot;subroutine&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">switch <br>
An option you give on a command line to influence the way
your program works, usually introduced with a minus sign.
The word is also used as a nickname for a &quot;switch <br>
statement&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">switch cluster <br>
The combination of multiple command-line switches (e.g., -a
-b -c) into one switch (e.g., -abc). Any switch with an
additional &quot;argument&quot; must be the last switch in a
<br>
cluster.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">switch statement <br>
A program technique that lets you evaluate an
&quot;expression&quot; and then, based on the value of the
expression, do a multiway branch to the appropriate piece of
code for that <br>
value. Also called a &quot;case structure&quot;, named after
the similar Pascal construct. See See &quot;Basic
BLOCKs&quot; in perlsyn.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">symbol <br>
Generally, any &quot;token&quot; or &quot;metasymbol&quot;.
Often used more specifically to mean the sort of name you
might find in a &quot;symbol table&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">symbol table <br>
Where a &quot;compiler&quot; remembers symbols. A program
like Perl must somehow remember all the names of all the
variables, filehandles, and subroutines you&rsquo;ve used.
It does this <br>
by placing the names in a symbol table, which is implemented
in Perl using a &quot;hash table&quot;. There is a separate
symbol table for each &quot;package&quot; to give each
package its own <br>
&quot;namespace&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">symbolic debugger <br>
A program that lets you step through the execution of your
program, stopping or printing things out here and there to
see whether anything has gone wrong, and if so, what. <br>
The &quot;symbolic&quot; part just means that you can talk
to the debugger using the same symbols with which your
program is written.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">symbolic link <br>
An alternate filename that points to the real
&quot;filename&quot;, which in turn points to the real
&quot;file&quot;. Whenever the &quot;operating system&quot;
is trying to parse a &quot;pathname&quot; containing <br>
a symbolic link, it merely substitutes the new name and
continues parsing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">symbolic reference <br>
A variable whose value is the name of another variable or
subroutine. By dereferencing the first variable, you can get
at the second one. Symbolic references are illegal <br>
under use strict &rsquo;refs&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">synchronous <br>
Programming in which the orderly sequence of events can be
determined; that is, when things happen one after the other,
not at the same time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">syntactic sugar <br>
An alternative way of writing something more easily; a
shortcut.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">syntax <br>
From Greek, &quot;with-arrangement&quot;. How things
(particularly symbols) are put together with each other.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">syntax tree <br>
An internal representation of your program wherein
lower-level constructs dangle off the higher-level
constructs enclosing them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">syscall <br>
A &quot;function&quot; call directly to the &quot;operating
system&quot;. Many of the important subroutines and
functions you use aren&rsquo;t direct system calls, but are
built up in one or more <br>
layers above the system call level. In general, Perl
programmers don&rsquo;t need to worry about the distinction.
However, if you do happen to know which Perl functions are
<br>
really syscalls, you can predict which of these will set the
$! ($ERRNO) variable on failure. Unfortunately, beginning
programmers often confusingly employ the term &quot;system
<br>
call&quot; to mean what happens when you call the Perl
system function, which actually involves many syscalls. To
avoid any confusion, we nearly always use say
&quot;syscall&quot; for <br>
something you could call indirectly via Perl&rsquo;s syscall
function, and never for something you would call with
Perl&rsquo;s system function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">T <br>
tainted <br>
Said of data derived from the grubby hands of a user and
thus unsafe for a secure program to rely on. Perl does taint
checks if you run a &quot;setuid&quot; (or
&quot;setgid&quot;) program, or <br>
if you use the -T switch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TCP Short for Transmission
Control Protocol. A protocol wrapped around the Internet
Protocol to make an unreliable packet transmission mechanism
appear to the application <br>
program to be a reliable &quot;stream&quot; of bytes.
(Usually.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">term <br>
Short for a &quot;terminal&quot;, that is, a leaf node of a
&quot;syntax tree&quot;. A thing that functions
grammatically as an &quot;operand&quot; for the operators in
an expression.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">terminator <br>
A &quot;character&quot; or &quot;string&quot; that marks the
end of another string. The $/ variable contains the string
that terminates a readline operation, which chomp deletes
from the end. <br>
Not to be confused with delimiters or separators. The period
at the end of this sentence is a terminator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ternary <br>
An &quot;operator&quot; taking three operands. Sometimes
pronounced &quot;trinary&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">text <br>
A &quot;string&quot; or &quot;file&quot; containing
primarily printable characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">thread <br>
Like a forked process, but without &quot;fork&quot;&rsquo;s
inherent memory protection. A thread is lighter weight than
a full process, in that a process could have multiple
threads running <br>
around in it, all fighting over the same process&rsquo;s
memory space unless steps are taken to protect threads from
each other. See threads.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tie The bond between a magical
variable and its implementation class. See &quot;tie&quot;
in perlfunc and perltie.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TMTOWTDI <br>
There&rsquo;s More Than One Way To Do It, the Perl Motto.
The notion that there can be more than one valid path to
solving a programming problem in context. (This
doesn&rsquo;t mean <br>
that more ways are always better or that all possible paths
are equally desirable--just that there need not be One True
Way.) Pronounced TimToady.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">token <br>
A morpheme in a programming language, the smallest unit of
text with semantic significance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tokener <br>
A module that breaks a program text into a sequence of
tokens for later analysis by a parser.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tokenizing <br>
Splitting up a program text into tokens. Also known as
&quot;lexing&quot;, in which case you get
&quot;lexemes&quot; instead of tokens.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">toolbox approach <br>
The notion that, with a complete set of simple tools that
work well together, you can build almost anything you want.
Which is fine if you&rsquo;re assembling a tricycle, but if
<br>
you&rsquo;re building a defranishizing comboflux
regurgalator, you really want your own machine shop in which
to build special tools. Perl is sort of a machine shop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">transliterate <br>
To turn one string representation into another by mapping
each character of the source string to its corresponding
character in the result string. See <br>
&quot;tr/SEARCHLIST/REPLACEMENTLIST/cdsr&quot; in
perlop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">trigger <br>
An event that causes a &quot;handler&quot; to be run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">trinary <br>
Not a stellar system with three stars, but an
&quot;operator&quot; taking three operands. Sometimes
pronounced &quot;ternary&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">troff <br>
A venerable typesetting language from which Perl derives the
name of its $% variable and which is secretly used in the
production of Camel books.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">true <br>
Any scalar value that doesn&rsquo;t evaluate to 0 or
&quot;&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">truncating <br>
Emptying a file of existing contents, either automatically
when opening a file for writing or explicitly via the
truncate function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">type <br>
See &quot;data type&quot; and &quot;class&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">type casting <br>
Converting data from one type to another. C permits this.
Perl does not need it. Nor want it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">typed lexical <br>
A &quot;lexical variable&quot; that is declared with a
&quot;class&quot; type: &quot;my Pony $bill&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">typedef <br>
A type definition in the C language.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">typeglob <br>
Use of a single identifier, prefixed with &quot;*&quot;. For
example, *name stands for any or all of $name, @name, %name,
&amp;name, or just &quot;name&quot;. How you use it
determines whether it <br>
is interpreted as all or only one of them. See
&quot;Typeglobs and Filehandles&quot; in perldata.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">typemap <br>
A description of how C types may be transformed to and from
Perl types within an &quot;extension&quot; module written in
&quot;XS&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">U <br>
UDP User Datagram Protocol, the typical way to send
datagrams over the Internet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UID A user ID. Often used in the
context of &quot;file&quot; or &quot;process&quot;
ownership.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">umask <br>
A mask of those &quot;permission bits&quot; that should be
forced off when creating files or directories, in order to
establish a policy of whom you&rsquo;ll ordinarily deny
access to. See <br>
the umask function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unary operator <br>
An operator with only one &quot;operand&quot;, like
&quot;!&quot; or chdir. Unary operators are usually prefix
operators; that is, they precede their operand. The
&quot;++&quot; and &quot;--&quot; operators can <br>
be either prefix or postfix. (Their position does change
their meanings.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unicode <br>
A character set comprising all the major character sets of
the world, more or less. See perlunicode and
&lt;http://www.unicode.org&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unix <br>
A very large and constantly evolving language with several
alternative and largely incompatible syntaxes, in which
anyone can define anything any way they choose, and usually
<br>
do. Speakers of this language think it&rsquo;s easy to learn
because it&rsquo;s so easily twisted to one&rsquo;s own
ends, but dialectical differences make tribal
intercommunication nearly <br>
impossible, and travelers are often reduced to a pidgin-like
subset of the language. To be universally understood, a Unix
shell programmer must spend years of study in the <br>
art. Many have abandoned this discipline and now communicate
via an Esperanto-like language called Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In ancient times, Unix was also
used to refer to some code that a couple of people at Bell
Labs wrote to make use of a PDP-7 computer that wasn&rsquo;t
doing much of anything else <br>
at the time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">V <br>
value <br>
An actual piece of data, in contrast to all the variables,
references, keys, indexes, operators, and whatnot that you
need to access the value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">variable <br>
A named storage location that can hold any of various kinds

Mathematical jargon for a list of scalar values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">virtual <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">void context <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">v-string <br>
A &quot;version&quot; or &quot;vector&quot;
&quot;string&quot; specified with a &quot;v&quot; followed
by a series of decimal integers in dot notation, for
instance, &quot;v1.20.300.4000&quot;. Each number turns into
a <br>
&quot;character&quot; with the specified ordinal value. (The
&quot;v&quot; is optional when there are at least three
integers.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">W <br>
warning <br>
A message printed to the &quot;STDERR&quot; stream to the

<p style="margin-top: 1em">word <br>
In normal &quot;computerese&quot;, the piece of data of the
size most efficiently handled by your computer, typically 32
bits or so, give or take a few powers of 2. In Perl culture,
<br>
it more often refers to an alphanumeric
&quot;identifier&quot; (including underscores), or to a
string of nonwhitespace characters bounded by whitespace or
string boundaries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">working directory <br>
Your current &quot;directory&quot;, from which relative
pathnames are interpreted by the &quot;operating
system&quot;. The operating system knows your current
directory because you told it with <br>

the opposite of magic because everything works exactly as it
appears, as in the three-argument form of open.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">X <br>
XS A language to extend Perl with C and C++. XS is an
interface description file format used to create an
extension interface between Perl and C code (or a C library)

A process that has died (exited) but whose parent has not
yet received proper notification of its demise by virtue of
