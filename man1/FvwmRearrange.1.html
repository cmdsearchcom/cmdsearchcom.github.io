<p>FvwmRearrange(1) Fvwm Modules FvwmRearrange(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
FvwmRearrange - rearrange fvwm windows</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
FvwmRearrange is spawned by fvwm, so no command line
invocation will work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This module can be called to tile or cascade windows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When tiling the module attempts
to tile windows on the current screen subject to certain
constraints. Horizontal or vertical tiling is performed so
that each window does not <br>
overlap another, and by default each window is resized to
its nearest resize increment (note sometimes some space
might appear between tiled windows -- this is why).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When cascading the module
attempts to cascade windows on the current screen subject to
certain constraints. Layering is performed so consecutive
windows will have their window <br>
titles visible underneath the previous.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INVOCATION <br>
FvwmRearrange is best invoked from a menu, pop up or button.
There are a number of command line options which can be used
to constrain the layering, these are described below. <br>
As an example case, one could call FvwmRearrange with the
following arguments: <br>
FvwmRearrange -tile -h 10 10 90 90 <br>
or <br>
FvwmRearrange -cascade -resize 10 2 80 70</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first invocation will
horizontally tile windows with a bounding box which starts
at 10 by 10 percent into and down the screen and ends at 90
by 90 percent into and down the <br>
screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The second invocation will
cascade windows starting 10 by 2 percent into and down the
screen. Windows will be constrained to 80 by 70 percent of
the screen dimensions. Since <br>
the resize is also specified, windows will be resized to the
given constrained width and height.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FvwmRearrange can be called as
FvwmTile or FvwmCascade. This is equivalent to providing the
-tile or -cascade option. This form is obsolete and supplied
for backwards compatibil&acirc; <br>
ity only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Command-line arguments passed to
FvwmRearrange are described here.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a Causes all window types to be
affected, even ones with the WindowListSkip style.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-animate <br>
Attempt to do an animated move, this is ignored if -resize
or -maximize are used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-cascade <br>
Cascade windows. This argument must be the first on the
command line. This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-desk Causes all windows on the
desk to be cascaded/tiled instead of the current screen
only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-flatx Inhibits border width
increment. Only used when cascading.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-flaty Inhibits border height
increment. Only used when cascading.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Tiles horizontally (default
is to tile vertically). Used for tiling only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-incx arg <br>
Specifies a horizontal increment which is successively added
to cascaded windows. arg is a percentage of screen width, or
pixel value if a p is suffixed. Default is <br>
zero. Used only for cascading.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-incy arg <br>
Specifies a vertical increment which is successively added
to cascaded windows. arg is a percentage of screen height,
or pixel value if a p is suffixed. Default is zero. <br>
Used only for cascading.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m Causes maximized windows to
also be affected (implied by -a).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-maximize <br>
When moving/resizing a window, put it also into maximized
state.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mn arg <br>
Tiles up to arg windows in tile direction. If more windows
exist, a new direction row or column is created (in effect,
a matrix is created). Used only when tiling win&acirc; <br>
dows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-noanimate <br>
Do not attempt to do an animated move.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nomaximize <br>
Do not put windows into maximized state.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-noraise <br>
Inhibits window raising, leaving the depth ordering
intact.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-noresize <br>
Inhibits window resizing, leaving window sizes intact. This
is the default when cascading windows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nostretch <br>
If tiling: inhibits window growth to fit tile. Windows are
shrunk to fit the tile but not expanded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If cascading: inhibits window
expansion when using the -resize option. Windows will only
shrink to fit the maximal width and height (if given).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Reverses the window
sequence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-resize <br>
Forces all windows to resize to the constrained width and
height (if given). This is the default when tiling
windows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Causes sticky windows to also
be affected (implied by -a).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sp Causes windows sticky across
pages to also be affected (implied by -a).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sd Causes windows sticky across
desks to also be affected (implied by -a).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Causes transient windows to
also be affected (implied by -a).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-tile Tile windows. This
argument must be the first on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u Causes untitled windows to
also be affected (implied by -a).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ewmhiwa <br>
When rearranging windows, make the calculation ignore the
working area, such as EwmhBaseStruts; by default,
FvwmRearrange will honour the working area.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Up to four numbers can be placed
on the command line that are not switches. The first pair
specify an x and y offset to start the first window (default
is 0, 0). The <br>
meaning of the second pair depends on operation mode:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When tiling windows it specifies
an absolute coordinate reference denoting the lower right
bounding box for tiling.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When cascading it specifies a
maximal width and height for the layered windows. If an
affected window exceeds either this width or height, it is
resized to the maximal <br>
width or height.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If any number is suffixed with
the letter p, then it is taken to be a pixel value,
otherwise it is interpreted as a screen percentage.
Specifying zero for any parameter <br>
is equivalent to not specifying it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
It is probably not a good idea to delete windows while
windows are being rearranged.</p>
