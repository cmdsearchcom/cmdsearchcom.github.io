The <i>fhist</i> program is used to keep track of the successive versions of a
  file. Using this program, you can remember all of your changes to a file, and
  get back any one of the old versions. The uses of this ability are:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">1.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">You can make a series of tentative edits to the file, and
      if necessary back up to the last &quot;good&quot; edit.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">2.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">You can delete old subroutines and code from your file
      which are obsolete, but still be able to get them back in the future in
      case a need for them arises.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">3.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">You can compare two versions of the file to see how you
      fixed some old problem, so that you can check up on the correctness of the
      fix at a later date.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">4.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">You get a record of your remarks for each version, so that
      you can quickly know what bugs were fixed, and what features were
      implemented.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">5.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The date the file was last edited can be automatically
      stored in the file.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <i>fhist</i> program manipulates modules. A module is simply any text file
  that you are interested in keeping versions of. For example, a source file
  <i>doit.c</i> is a module, and so is a documentation file <i>howto.doc</i>.
  The module name includes the suffix of the file (as in the above examples).
  However, pathnames are not part of a module name, so that
  <i>/usr/dbell/bar.c</i> cannot be a legal module name. A module name is
  limited to 12 characters since the <i>fhist</i> program needs two extra
  characters for its own purpose.

It is possible to have information about the state of the file inserted into the
  file. See the <b>-Modify</b> and <b>-No&#x2010;Keywords</b> options, below,
  for more infromation.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
The following options are understood:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-Path</b> <i>pathname</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Modules are stored in a directory, called the
  module storage directory. The default directory is <i>FHIST</i>, and therefore
  is located relative to your current directory. This is convenient when you are
  in a directory containing many modules, and you want a local storage directory
  to contain just those modules. If you use the <b>-p</b> option, then you can
  locate the storage directory anywhere you choose. This is useful if you choose
  to have a common storage directory for all of your files, independent of where
  they actually are used.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The files inside of the storage directory should not be changed by you. Doing so
  will probably corrupt your edit history, causing errors when you extract old
  revisions. For your information, though, each module is stored as two files in
  the directory. The one with the <i>.s</i> suffix is a copy of the newest
  version of the module, with one extra line at the beginning. The one with the
  <i>.e</i> suffix is the edit history of the module, and contains the
  information needed to extract previous revisions of the module. Thus if the
  edit history is ever corrupted, you will at least have the most recent version
  of the module.</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-MaKe_Path</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This option may be used to request that the path directory
      be created automatically if it does not yet exist. This works for both the
      directory specified by the -Path option, and for the default. Intermediate
      directories will also be created if necessary.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-BINary</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This option may be used to specify that the file is binary,
      that it may contain NUL characters. It is essential that you have
      consistent presence or absence of the <b>-BINary</b> option for each file
      when combined with the <b>-CReate</b>, <b>-Update</b>,
      <b>-Conditional_Update</b> and <b>-Extract</b> options. Failure to do so
      will produce inconsistent results. Note: this is different behaviour to
      the <i>fcomp</i>(1) option of the same name. Note: the <b>-BINary</b>
      option does <i>not</i> imply the <b>-No&#x2010;Keywords</b> option.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-CReate</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">To use the <i>fhist</i> program for the first
  time, you need to create your storage directory. Therefore, <i>cd</i> to the
  directory where you want it to be, which is probably the directory containing
  the modules you want to save the revisions of. Then create the directory
  <i>FHIST</i> (or some other name if you don't want to use the default name).
<div class="Pp"></div>
To start using a module under <i>fhist</i>, you must first use the
  <b>-CReate</b> option. This creates the initial edit for that module in the
  storage directory, with the contents of the specified module as the initial
  edit. Thus, if you have a source file <i>prog.c</i>, then the command:
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<pre>
fhist prog.c -create
</pre>
</div>
creates the initial edit of the module. As part of this process, you are asked
  to provide remarks about the file. These remarks can be seen later using the
  <b>-List</b> option (described below). After the remarks have been typed, the
  contents of the file are then saved. You can then delete the file
  <i>prog.c</i> if desired, and <i>fhist</i> would be able to recreate it later.
  Or you can leave it there as the working copy of the module.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-CReate</b> option may be combined with the <b>-Update</b> or
  <b>-Conditional_Update</b> options to create the file if required.</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-Update</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">To save another revision of the module, you
  use the <b>-Update</b> option. This updates the files in the storage directory
  to include the latest changes. Remarks are again asked for so that you can
  document why you made this edit. Thus, to continue the example, after editing
  <i>prog.c</i>, the command:
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<pre>
fhist prog.c -u
</pre>
</div>
will save the changes as a new edit. This command compares the newest version of
  the module to the previous version, saves the differences in the <i>.e</i>
  file, and copies the new source to the <i>.s</i> file. At this point, you can
  once again delete the <i>prog.c</i> file if desired, and later get back either
  of the two versions of the program.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <i>fhist</i> program handles quota or disk full problems during a create or
  update operation without damage occurring to the edit history files. If an
  edit cannot be completed because of such problems, the edit is backed out
  completely, and you will get an error message about the disk problem. There is
  no need for any error recovery in this case, other than retrying the update
  when more disk space is available. The <i>fhist</i> program also disables
  signals during the critical file operations, so you do not have to worry about
  damaging the edit history files because of attempts to quit out of the
  program.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-CReate</b> option may be combined with the <b>-Update</b> or
  <b>-Conditional_Update</b> options to create the file if required.</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-Input</b> <i>filename</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">In either the <b>-CReate</b> or <b>-Update</b>
  options, the file containing the new version of the module defaults to the
  same name as the module. In the example, the module <i>prog.c</i> was created
  and updated from the data in the file <i>prog.c</i>. When you wish the data to
  come from some other file, you can use the <b>-Input</b> option, which
  specifies the input file to use for the data. For example, if you wanted to
  update <i>prog.c</i>, but from a filename called <i>newprog.c</i>, then the
  command:
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<pre>
fhist prog.c -u -i newprog.c
</pre>
</div>
would save a new revision of module <i>prog.c</i>, but with the data that was in
  the file <i>newprog.c</i>. In this case, the file <i>prog.c</i> does not have
  to exist, and isn't referenced even if it did exist. Again, once the update is
  complete, you could delete the <i>newprog.c</i> file if desired and then later
  you can retrieve its contents.</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-Remarks</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Remarks can be read from a file instead of
  from the terminal. The <b>-Remarks</b> option can be used to specify a file
  name containing the remarks. If there is no file name following the
  <b>-Remarks</b> option, then no remarks at all are used. The command:
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<pre>
fhist prog.c -u -r
</pre>
</div>
would create a new revision of <i>prog.c</i> without asking for or saving any
  remarks about the edit.</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-Remark_String</b> <i>text</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">It is also possible to specify the remarks directly on the
      command line. You may only use this option once.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-Extract</b> [ <i>edit</i> ]</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">To retrieve a previous revision of a module,
  you specify the name of the module and use the <b>-Extract</b> option to
  specify the edit number you want retrieved. Edit numbers are assigned
  sequentially starting with 1. Thus the initial version of the module has edit
  number 1, the first revision has edit number 2, and so on until the latest
  revision. If the <b>-Extract</b> option is not used, or if no edit number is
  supplied for it, then the latest edit number is extracted. Therefore, this is
  the default action if no options at all are specified.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Edit numbers can also be zero, negative, or be a name with an optional offset.
  The number zero represents the latest edit number, and negative numbers
  indicate edit numbers backwards from the latest edit number. Edit names
  represent edit numbers whose name had been set by using the <b>-Name</b>
  option. For example, if edit number 10 was associated with the name
  <i>foo</i>, then the edit name <i>foo</i> represents 10, <i>foo&#x2010;4</i>
  represents edit number6, and <i>foo+2</i> represents edit number 12. The
  special reserved names <i>oldest</i> and <i>newest</i> refer to the oldest and
  newest versions of the module in the edit history.
<div class="Pp"></div>
As an example of retrievals, assume that you have saved ten versions of the
  module <i>prog.c</i>. The following commands will then extract the versions of
  the file with the specified edit numbers:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">fhist prog.c</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">version 10 (the latest)</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">fhist prog.c -e 9</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">version 9 (the version just prior)</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">fhist prog.c -e oldest</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">version 1 (the oldest version)</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">fhist prog.c -e -2</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">version 8 (latest version - 2)</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The output filename is again defaulted to the module name. So when the module
  <i>prog.c</i> is extracted, the specified version of the module is written to
  the <i>prog.c</i> file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In order to prevent accidental overwriting of a file, the <i>fhist</i> program
  will by default ask you if overwriting is permitted if that would occur. A
  common mistake is to edit <i>prog.c</i>, and then try to update the module,
  but forget to specify the <b>-u</b> option. Then the <i>fhist</i> program
  would try to extract the newest version of the module, and thus overwrite the
  file with the new changes. Asking the question allows you to notice your
  mistake, and prevent the overwriting.</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-Output</b> <i>filename</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">You can change the output filename using the
  <b>-Output</b> option. Thus, the command:
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<pre>
fhist prog.c -o newprog.c
</pre>
</div>
will extract the latest version of the module <i>prog.c</i>, and put it into the
  file <i>newprog.c</i>. Once again, the file &quot;prog.c&quot; is ignored,
  whether or not it existed.</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-Force_Write</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    This option will force overwriting of the file, thus never asking you if
      overwriting is permitted. This is often useful in shell scripts, or when
      you are <i>sure</i> that you want to overwrite any existing file.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-No_Write</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    This option is the no&#x2010;overwrite option, and will cause any existing
      files to <i>not</i> be overwritten, again without asking you. This is
      useful if you already have some of the modules in your directory, and you
      want to extract the rest of the modules without overwriting the ones you
      already have. Specifying both <b>-Fore_Write</b> and <b>-No_Write</b> is
      an error.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-Terminal</b> [ <i>edit</i> ]</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    This option is used to output an extracted module to the standard output,
      instead of writing it to a file. This is useful in order to view the
      beginning of a version of the file. This can be interrupted if you do not
      want to see the whole file.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-Modify</b> <i>number</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"></dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">When extracting a file, the <i>fhist</i>
  program looks for and updates special character sequences in the first few
  lines of the file. These special sequences are used for documentation
  purposes, such as describing the edit number the file is from. For speed of
  extraction and updating, these sequences are usually limited to the first 25
  lines of the file, since the <i>fhist</i> program then does not have to
  examine the entire file. The <b>-Modify</b> option can be used to change the
  number of lines to be modified from the default value of 25. Specifying zero
  totally disables the special character sequences, whereas specifying a very
  large number will cause the sequences to be checked for each line of the file
  (and thus slow the <i>fhist</i> program down).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Each special sequence is of the form <b>[# keyword value, keyword value, ...,
  keyword value #] ,</b> where each <i>keyword</i> describes an item, and each
  <i>value</i> is the value for the preceding keyword. The keywords can be in
  upper or lower case, or both. The single space following the <b>[#</b>,
  following each comma, and preceding the <b>#]</b> must be present. If the
  sequence is wrong, an unknown keyword is used, the line is longer than 200
  characters, or more than four keywords are used, then the whole line will not
  be changed. The current keywords which can be used are the following:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">edit</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The edit number</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">date</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The date that the edit was created</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">user</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The user name of the user who created the edit</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">module</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The module name</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
In order to use this special character sequence, you simply insert it into your
  module inside of a comment (within the first few lines). When this is done,
  the value parts of the sequence can be null. For example, if you want to put a
  special sequence into a program called <i>delete.c</i>, then you could edit
  the first few lines as follows:
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<pre>
/*
 * Delete - program to delete files
 * [# Edit, Date #]
 */
</pre>
</div>
When an extract is done, the proper edit number and date are automatically
  inserted as the new values. Thus, if you extract edit 23 of the module
  <i>delete.c</i> which had been created on 8 August 89, then the resulting file
  would begin:
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<pre>
/*
 * Delete - program to delete files
 * [# Edit 23, Date 8&#x2010;Aug&#x2010;89 #]
 */
</pre>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
When updating a module, it is never necessary to edit these sequences, as any
  old values will be removed and replaced with the new ones. Also, when using
  the <b>-d</b> or <b>-du</b> options (described below), lines with these
  sequences compare as if the values were null, and thus will not cause spurious
  differences.
<div class="Pp"></div>
During an update, the special character sequences are read and any edit value
  found is compared against the current edit number of the module. If they
  differ, then the update fails. This provides an interlock check for the case
  of two users extracting the same version of a file, editing it, and then both
  updating it without knowledge of each other. In this case, the second user
  would fail, and then he can merge his edits with the previous user's edit and
  then retry the update. This checking is disabled if there is no special
  character sequence containing the edit keyword, the edit number value is null,
  or if the <b>-Forced_Update</b> option is used to indicate that the check is
  not needed.</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-No_Keywords</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This option may be used to disable the use of the keyword
      special character sequences described above. Text containing keyword
      sequences is treated as plain text. Note: the <b>-No_Keywords</b> option
      does <i>not</i> imply the <b>-BINary</b> option.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-Name</b> <i>string</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    This option is used to associate a name for the newest version of a module.
      It can be given along with the <b>-CReate</b>, <b>-Update</b>, or
      <b>-Difference_Update</b> options, to specify a name for the new version
      of the module. It can also be given by itself in order to specify a name
      for the newest version of a module. Each edit number can have many names
      associated with it, so this will not remove any previously defined name
      for the edit. This option is useful to correlate many modules together.
      For example, when a new version of a program is ready to be released, you
      could give each module of the program the same name <i>release1</i>. Then
      in the future, you can recreate the sources making up that release by
      extracting the edits with the name <i>release1</i> for every module. Edit
      names cannot begin with a digit, and cannot contain plus or minus signs.
      These rules prevent ambiguous parsing of edit numbers for the
      <b>-Extract</b>, <b>-Terminal</b>, <b>-ALL</b>, and <b>-List</b>
    options.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-List</b> [ <i>edit1</i> [ <i>edit2</i> ]]</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    This option prints a list of edits for the module, giving the user name,
      date, user remarks, and names specified for the edits. If no edit number
      is supplied, then all edits are printed in reverse order. If a single edit
      number is supplied, then only that edit number is printed. If two edit
      numbers are supplied, then all edits in the specified range are printed.
      The output from this option defaults to the terminal. You can use the
      <b>-Output</b> option to save the results to a file.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-Difference</b> [ <i>edit1</i> [ <i>edit2</i> ]]</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">This option is used to display the differences
  between two versions of a module, or a file and a version of a module. There
  are three modes for this action, depending on how many edit numbers are
  supplied. These modes are illustrated by the following examples:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">fhist foo.c -d</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Compare latest version against file &quot;foo.c&quot;</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">fhist foo.c -d 3</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Compare version 3 against file &quot;foo.c&quot;</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">fhist foo.c -d 3 4</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Compare version 3 against version 4</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This option accepts the <b>-Input</b> option to specify the file to be compared.
  When using the <b>-Difference</b> option, the output defaults to the terminal.
  Therefore, you must use <b>-Output</b> if you wish the differences saved to a
  file. Using <b>-Quick</b> with <b>-Difference</b> will only output a quick
  summary of the changes, instead of the detailed changes. This summary only
  supplies the number of lines inserted, deleted, and unchanged between the
  files. Using <b>-What</b> with <b>-Difference</b> will display all of both
  files, showing in detail what the differences are using change bars.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-Difference</b> option may need to write one or two temporary files in
  order to extract old versions of a module to be compared. These files have
  names like <i>T$n_nnn .</i> They are deleted again just before differences are
  output, so that stopping the output before it is complete will not leave these
  files around. The temporary files are usually written to the current
  directory. If this is not reasonable because of permission or quota problems,
  then you can specify the directory for writing the temporary files into. This
  is done by defining the <i>TMPDIR</i> environment variable to be the path of
  the directory.</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-Difference_Update</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">This option combines the effects of the
  <b>-Difference</b> and <b>-Update</b> options. It displays the differences
  between a file and the latest version of a module. If there are any
  differences, it then proceeds to perform an update of the module with that
  file, asking for remarks as usual. This option is very useful when used with
  wildcarded module names. Then you can update just those modules which were
  changed by an edit session, and see the changes for each module before typing
  the appropriate remark for each module.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You may specify both of the <b>-Difference</b> and <b>-Update</b> options, or
  you may use this option. The results are identical.</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-Conditional_Update</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">

<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">This option conditionally updates a module.
  That is, it will only do an update if there are any differences between a file
  and the latest version of a module. This is convenient when related changes
  are made to many modules in a directory, and one command using wildcards can
  update just those modules that were changed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-CReate</b> option may be combined with the <b>-Update</b> or
  <b>-Conditional_Update</b> options to create the file if required.</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-CLean</b></dt>

    This option is used to remove files which match the newest versions of
      modules. If a file exists which matches the newest version of a module,
      then the file is deleted, otherwise it is kept. This option is used to
      clean up a work directory after building a new version of a product. This
      option is especially useful when used with the <b>-ALL</b> option. It will
      also accept the <b>-Input</b> option to specify a directory containing the
      files to be cleaned.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-CHeck</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"></dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">This option is used to find out if a file does
  not match the latest version of a module. If so, a message is given. If the
  file does match, no output occurs. This option is thus useful to determine
  which files have been modified and in need of updating. The <b>-ALL</b> option
  is defaulted for this option, since it is usually used for all modules. For
  example,
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<pre>
fhist -CHeck
</pre>
</div>
will report on all files which are different than the latest modules. If
  <b>-Quick</b> is specified, then the output will consist of the module names
  with no other output. This is useful for the backquote operator in shell
  scripts for referencing the modules which are out of date. The <b>-CHeck</b>
  option will also accept the <b>-Input</b> option.</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-PRune</b> <i>edit</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"></dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">This option is used to permanently remove
  early edits from an edit history. This is useful if you wish to cut down on
  the amount of disk space taken by an edit history file, or when you want to
  start another release of a file, and want a copy of the edit history file for
  that new release. The option takes an edit number to preserve, and all edits
  in the edit history file before that edit are deleted, and can no longer be
  referenced. For example, to keep only the current edit plus the previous 10
  edits of the module <i>file</i>, you could use the command:
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<pre>
fhist file -prune -10
</pre>
</div>
Since the <b>-PRune</b> option is unrecoverable (unless backup files are
  available), the <i>fhist</i> program asks the user to verify that the prune is
  really wanted. The <b>-Forced_Update</b> option can be used to bypass this
  verification.</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-ALL</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"></dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">This option can be used with any of the action
  options. It means perform the operation for all modules in the module storage
  directory. Alternatively, you can specify multiple module names on the command
  line, and the actions will be performed with those modules. You cannot specify
  both <b>-ALL</b> and module names.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When using multiple modules or the <b>-ALL</b> option, the <b>-Input</b> and
  <b>-Output</b> options have a slightly different meaning. In these cases, the
  <b>-Input</b> and <b>-Output</b> arguments are a directory name which contains
  filenames with the same name as the module names. If the argument is not a
  directory, then an error is given. This feature is useful for example, to
  extract all the modules and place them into some remote directory, as in:
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<pre>
fhist -all -e -o tempdir
</pre>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
You should be careful when specifying numeric edit numbers for multiple modules.
  Most probably, a particular edit number is not appropriate for multiple
  modules, since changes corresponding to a particular edit number are not
  usually related. Using named edits avoids these problems. As an example, if
  you wanted to extract every module which had an edit that was named
  <i>rev3</i>, then you could use the command:
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<pre>
fhist -all -e rev3
</pre>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Some other useful examples of commands which use multiple modules are:
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<pre>
fhist *.c -create
fhist -check -all
fhist -cu -all
</pre>
</div>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-Verbose</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"></dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">This option can be specified with any other
  action, and outputs status information about the progress of the action. This
  is useful for debugging of problems, or just for amusement when the system is
  slow or a large file is being processed. It accepts a numeric argument to
  indicate the verbosity for output. The levels are as follows:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">0</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">No output at all (except for errors).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">1</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Single&#x2010;line output describing action (default).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">2</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Detailed status as action proceeds.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-Help</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    Give some help on how to use the <i>fhist</i> program.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-VERSion</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>

<div class="Pp"></div>
All options may be abbreviated; the abbreviation is documented as the upper case
  letters, all lower case letters and underscores (_) are optional. You must use
  consecutive sequences of optional letters.
<div class="Pp"></div>
All options are case insensitive, you may type them in upper case or lower case
  or a combination of both, case is not important.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For example: the arguments &quot;-help, &quot;-HELP&quot; and &quot;-h&quot; are
  all interpreted to mean the <b>-Help</b> option. The argument &quot;-hlp&quot;
  will not be understood, because consecutive optional characters were not
  supplied.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Options and other command line arguments may be mixed arbitrarily on the command
  line.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The GNU long option names are understood. Since all option names for
  <i>fhist</i> are long, this means ignoring the extra leading '-'. The &quot;
  <b>-</b><i>option</i><b>=</b><i>value</i>&quot; convention is also understood.

  NAME EXPANSION</a></h1>
As a convenience, if a pathname begins with a period and a environment variable
  exists with that name, then the value of the environment variable will be used
  as the actual pathname. For example, if a environment variable of <i>.FOO</i>
  has the value <i>this.is.a.long.name</i>, then the command
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<pre>
fhist -o .FOO
</pre>
</div>
is actually equivilant to the command
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<pre>
fhist -o this.is.a.long.name
</pre>
</div>
If you want to prevent the expansion of a pathname which begins with a period,
  then you can use an alternate form for the pathname, as in:
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<pre>
fhist -o ./.FOO
</pre>
</div>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>

In general, fhist can handle all text files you throw at it, even international
  text with unusual encodings. However, fhist is <i>unable</i> to cope elegantly
  with files which contain the NUL character.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <i>fcomp</i>(1) program simply prints a warning, and continues, you need to
  know that it converts NUL characters into an 0x80 value before performing the
  comparison.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <i>fmerge</i>(1) program also converts the NUL character to an 0x80 value
  before merging, after a warning, and any output file will contain this value,
  rather than the original NUL character.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <i>fhist</i>(1) program, however, generates a fatal error if any input file
  contains NUL characters. This is intended to protect your source files for
  unintentional corruption. Use <b>-BINary</b> for files which absolutely must
  contain NUL characters.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="EXIT_STATUS"><a class="selflink" href="#EXIT_STATUS">EXIT

The <i>fhist</i> program will exit with a status of 1 on any error. The
  <i>fhist</i> program will only exit with a status of 0 if there are no errors.
