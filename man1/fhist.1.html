<p>fhist(1) General Commands Manual fhist(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
fhist - file history</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
fhist filename... option...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fhist -Help</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fhist -VERSion</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The fhist program is used to keep track of the successive
versions of a file. Using this program, you can remember all
of your changes to a file, and get back any one of the old
<br>
versions. The uses of this ability are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. You can make a series of
tentative edits to the file, and if necessary back up to the
last &quot;good&quot; edit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. You can delete old
subroutines and code from your file which are obsolete, but
still be able to get them back in the future in case a need
for them arises.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. You can compare two versions
of the file to see how you fixed some old problem, so that
you can check up on the correctness of the fix at a later
date.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. You get a record of your
remarks for each version, so that you can quickly know what
bugs were fixed, and what features were implemented.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5. The date the file was last
edited can be automatically stored in the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The fhist program manipulates
modules. A module is simply any text file that you are
interested in keeping versions of. For example, a source
file doit.c is a module, and so is <br>
a documentation file howto.doc. The module name includes the
suffix of the file (as in the above examples). However,
pathnames are not part of a module name, so that <br>
/usr/dbell/bar.c cannot be a legal module name. A module
name is limited to 12 characters since the fhist program
needs two extra characters for its own purpose.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Keyword Substitution <br>
It is possible to have information about the state of the
file inserted into the file. See the -Modify and
-No&acirc;Keywords options, below, for more infromation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The following options are understood:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Path pathname <br>
Modules are stored in a directory, called the module storage
directory. The default directory is FHIST, and therefore is
located relative to your current directory. <br>
This is convenient when you are in a directory containing
many modules, and you want a local storage directory to
contain just those modules. If you use the -p option, <br>
then you can locate the storage directory anywhere you
choose. This is useful if you choose to have a common
storage directory for all of your files, independent of <br>
where they actually are used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The files inside of the storage
directory should not be changed by you. Doing so will
probably corrupt your edit history, causing errors when you
extract old revisions. <br>
For your information, though, each module is stored as two
files in the directory. The one with the .s suffix is a copy
of the newest version of the module, with one <br>
extra line at the beginning. The one with the .e suffix is
the edit history of the module, and contains the information
needed to extract previous revisions of the mod&acirc; <br>
ule. Thus if the edit history is ever corrupted, you will at
least have the most recent version of the module.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-MaKe_Path <br>
This option may be used to request that the path directory
be created automatically if it does not yet exist. This
works for both the directory specified by the -Path <br>
option, and for the default. Intermediate directories will
also be created if necessary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-BINary This option may be used
to specify that the file is binary, that it may contain NUL
characters. It is essential that you have consistent
presence or absence of the <br>
-BINary option for each file when combined with the -CReate,
-Update, -Conditional_Update and -Extract options. Failure
to do so will produce inconsistent results. <br>
Note: this is different behaviour to the fcomp(1) option of
the same name. Note: the -BINary option does not imply the
-No&acirc;Keywords option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-CReate <br>
To use the fhist program for the first time, you need to
create your storage directory. Therefore, cd to the
directory where you want it to be, which is probably the
<br>
directory containing the modules you want to save the
revisions of. Then create the directory FHIST (or some other
name if you don&rsquo;t want to use the default name).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To start using a module under
fhist, you must first use the -CReate option. This creates
the initial edit for that module in the storage directory,
with the contents of <br>
the specified module as the initial edit. Thus, if you have
a source file prog.c, then the command: <br>
fhist prog.c -create <br>
creates the initial edit of the module. As part of this
process, you are asked to provide remarks about the file.
These remarks can be seen later using the -List option <br>
(described below). After the remarks have been typed, the
contents of the file are then saved. You can then delete the
file prog.c if desired, and fhist would be able <br>
to recreate it later. Or you can leave it there as the
working copy of the module.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -CReate option may be
combined with the -Update or -Conditional_Update options to
create the file if required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Update <br>
To save another revision of the module, you use the -Update
option. This updates the files in the storage directory to
include the latest changes. Remarks are again <br>
asked for so that you can document why you made this edit.
Thus, to continue the example, after editing prog.c, the
command: <br>
fhist prog.c -u <br>
will save the changes as a new edit. This command compares
the newest version of the module to the previous version,
saves the differences in the .e file, and copies the <br>
new source to the .s file. At this point, you can once again
delete the prog.c file if desired, and later get back either
of the two versions of the program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The fhist program handles quota
or disk full problems during a create or update operation
without damage occurring to the edit history files. If an
edit cannot be com&acirc; <br>
pleted because of such problems, the edit is backed out
completely, and you will get an error message about the disk
problem. There is no need for any error recovery in <br>
this case, other than retrying the update when more disk
space is available. The fhist program also disables signals
during the critical file operations, so you do not <br>
have to worry about damaging the edit history files because
of attempts to quit out of the program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -CReate option may be
combined with the -Update or -Conditional_Update options to
create the file if required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Input filename <br>
In either the -CReate or -Update options, the file
containing the new version of the module defaults to the
same name as the module. In the example, the module prog.c
<br>
was created and updated from the data in the file prog.c.
When you wish the data to come from some other file, you can
use the -Input option, which specifies the input <br>
file to use for the data. For example, if you wanted to
update prog.c, but from a filename called newprog.c, then
the command: <br>
fhist prog.c -u -i newprog.c <br>
would save a new revision of module prog.c, but with the
data that was in the file newprog.c. In this case, the file
prog.c does not have to exist, and isn&rsquo;t referenced
<br>
even if it did exist. Again, once the update is complete,
you could delete the newprog.c file if desired and then
later you can retrieve its contents.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Remarks <br>
Remarks can be read from a file instead of from the
terminal. The -Remarks option can be used to specify a file
name containing the remarks. If there is no file name <br>
following the -Remarks option, then no remarks at all are
used. The command: <br>
fhist prog.c -u -r <br>
would create a new revision of prog.c without asking for or
saving any remarks about the edit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Remark_String text <br>
It is also possible to specify the remarks directly on the
command line. You may only use this option once.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Extract [ edit ] <br>
To retrieve a previous revision of a module, you specify the
name of the module and use the -Extract option to specify
the edit number you want retrieved. Edit numbers <br>
are assigned sequentially starting with 1. Thus the initial
version of the module has edit number 1, the first revision
has edit number 2, and so on until the latest <br>
revision. If the -Extract option is not used, or if no edit
number is supplied for it, then the latest edit number is
extracted. Therefore, this is the default action <br>
if no options at all are specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Edit numbers can also be zero,
negative, or be a name with an optional offset. The number
zero represents the latest edit number, and negative numbers
indicate edit num&acirc; <br>
bers backwards from the latest edit number. Edit names
represent edit numbers whose name had been set by using the
-Name option. For example, if edit number 10 was <br>
associated with the name foo, then the edit name foo
represents 10, foo&acirc;4 represents edit number6, and
foo+2 represents edit number 12. The special reserved names
oldest <br>
and newest refer to the oldest and newest versions of the
module in the edit history.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As an example of retrievals,
assume that you have saved ten versions of the module
prog.c. The following commands will then extract the
versions of the file with the <br>
specified edit numbers:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fhist prog.c <br>
version 10 (the latest)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fhist prog.c -e 9 <br>
version 9 (the version just prior)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fhist prog.c -e oldest <br>
version 1 (the oldest version)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fhist prog.c -e -2 <br>
version 8 (latest version - 2)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The output filename is again
defaulted to the module name. So when the module prog.c is
extracted, the specified version of the module is written to
the prog.c file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to prevent accidental
overwriting of a file, the fhist program will by default ask
you if overwriting is permitted if that would occur. A
common mistake is to <br>
edit prog.c, and then try to update the module, but forget
to specify the -u option. Then the fhist program would try
to extract the newest version of the module, and <br>
thus overwrite the file with the new changes. Asking the
question allows you to notice your mistake, and prevent the
overwriting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Output filename <br>
You can change the output filename using the -Output option.
Thus, the command: <br>
fhist prog.c -o newprog.c <br>
will extract the latest version of the module prog.c, and
put it into the file newprog.c. Once again, the file
&quot;prog.c&quot; is ignored, whether or not it
existed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Force_Write <br>
This option will force overwriting of the file, thus never
asking you if overwriting is permitted. This is often useful
in shell scripts, or when you are sure that you <br>
want to overwrite any existing file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-No_Write <br>
This option is the no&acirc;overwrite option, and will cause
any existing files to not be overwritten, again without
asking you. This is useful if you already have some of the
<br>
modules in your directory, and you want to extract the rest
of the modules without overwriting the ones you already
have. Specifying both -Fore_Write and -No_Write is an <br>
error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Terminal [ edit ] <br>
This option is used to output an extracted module to the
standard output, instead of writing it to a file. This is
useful in order to view the beginning of a version of <br>
the file. This can be interrupted if you do not want to see
the whole file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Modify number <br>
When extracting a file, the fhist program looks for and
updates special character sequences in the first few lines
of the file. These special sequences are used for doc&acirc;
<br>
umentation purposes, such as describing the edit number the
file is from. For speed of extraction and updating, these
sequences are usually limited to the first 25 lines <br>
of the file, since the fhist program then does not have to
examine the entire file. The -Modify option can be used to
change the number of lines to be modified from the <br>
default value of 25. Specifying zero totally disables the
special character sequences, whereas specifying a very large
number will cause the sequences to be checked for <br>
each line of the file (and thus slow the fhist program
down).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each special sequence is of the
form [# keyword value, keyword value, ..., keyword value #]
, where each keyword describes an item, and each value is
the value for the <br>
preceding keyword. The keywords can be in upper or lower
case, or both. The single space following the [#, following
each comma, and preceding the #] must be present. <br>
If the sequence is wrong, an unknown keyword is used, the
line is longer than 200 characters, or more than four
keywords are used, then the whole line will not be <br>
changed. The current keywords which can be used are the
following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">edit The edit number</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">date The date that the edit was
created</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">user The user name of the user
who created the edit</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">module The module name</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to use this special
character sequence, you simply insert it into your module
inside of a comment (within the first few lines). When this
is done, the value <br>
parts of the sequence can be null. For example, if you want
to put a special sequence into a program called delete.c,
then you could edit the first few lines as follows: <br>
/* <br>
* Delete - program to delete files <br>
* [# Edit, Date #] <br>
*/ <br>
When an extract is done, the proper edit number and date are
automatically inserted as the new values. Thus, if you
extract edit 23 of the module delete.c which had been <br>
created on 8 August 89, then the resulting file would begin:
<br>
/* <br>
* Delete - program to delete files <br>
* [# Edit 23, Date 8&acirc;Aug&acirc;89 #] <br>
*/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When updating a module, it is
never necessary to edit these sequences, as any old values
will be removed and replaced with the new ones. Also, when
using the -d or -du <br>
options (described below), lines with these sequences
compare as if the values were null, and thus will not cause
spurious differences.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">During an update, the special
character sequences are read and any edit value found is
compared against the current edit number of the module. If
they differ, then the <br>
update fails. This provides an interlock check for the case
of two users extracting the same version of a file, editing
it, and then both updating it without knowledge <br>
of each other. In this case, the second user would fail, and
then he can merge his edits with the previous user&rsquo;s
edit and then retry the update. This checking is dis&acirc;
<br>
abled if there is no special character sequence containing
the edit keyword, the edit number value is null, or if the
-Forced_Update option is used to indicate that the <br>
check is not needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-No_Keywords <br>
This option may be used to disable the use of the keyword
special character sequences described above. Text containing
keyword sequences is treated as plain text. Note: <br>
the -No_Keywords option does not imply the -BINary
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Name string <br>
This option is used to associate a name for the newest
version of a module. It can be given along with the -CReate,
-Update, or -Difference_Update options, to specify a <br>
name for the new version of the module. It can also be given
by itself in order to specify a name for the newest version
of a module. Each edit number can have many <br>
names associated with it, so this will not remove any
previously defined name for the edit. This option is useful
to correlate many modules together. For example, when <br>
a new version of a program is ready to be released, you
could give each module of the program the same name
release1. Then in the future, you can recreate the sources
<br>
making up that release by extracting the edits with the name
release1 for every module. Edit names cannot begin with a
digit, and cannot contain plus or minus signs. <br>
These rules prevent ambiguous parsing of edit numbers for
the -Extract, -Terminal, -ALL, and -List options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-List [ edit1 [ edit2 ]] <br>
This option prints a list of edits for the module, giving
the user name, date, user remarks, and names specified for
the edits. If no edit number is supplied, then all <br>
edits are printed in reverse order. If a single edit number
is supplied, then only that edit number is printed. If two
edit numbers are supplied, then all edits in the <br>
specified range are printed. The output from this option
defaults to the terminal. You can use the -Output option to
save the results to a file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Difference [ edit1 [ edit2 ]]
<br>
This option is used to display the differences between two
versions of a module, or a file and a version of a module.
There are three modes for this action, depending on <br>
how many edit numbers are supplied. These modes are
illustrated by the following examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fhist foo.c -d <br>
Compare latest version against file &quot;foo.c&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fhist foo.c -d 3 <br>
Compare version 3 against file &quot;foo.c&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fhist foo.c -d 3 4 <br>
Compare version 3 against version 4</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option accepts the -Input
option to specify the file to be compared. When using the
-Difference option, the output defaults to the terminal.
Therefore, you must <br>
use -Output if you wish the differences saved to a file.
Using -Quick with -Difference will only output a quick
summary of the changes, instead of the detailed changes.
<br>
This summary only supplies the number of lines inserted,
deleted, and unchanged between the files. Using -What with
-Difference will display all of both files, showing <br>
in detail what the differences are using change bars.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -Difference option may need
to write one or two temporary files in order to extract old
versions of a module to be compared. These files have names
like T$n_nnn . <br>
They are deleted again just before differences are output,
so that stopping the output before it is complete will not
leave these files around. The temporary files are <br>
usually written to the current directory. If this is not
reasonable because of permission or quota problems, then you
can specify the directory for writing the temporary <br>
files into. This is done by defining the TMPDIR environment
variable to be the path of the directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Difference_Update <br>
This option combines the effects of the -Difference and
-Update options. It displays the differences between a file
and the latest version of a module. If there are any <br>
differences, it then proceeds to perform an update of the
module with that file, asking for remarks as usual. This
option is very useful when used with wildcarded module <br>
names. Then you can update just those modules which were
changed by an edit session, and see the changes for each
module before typing the appropriate remark for each <br>
module.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may specify both of the
-Difference and -Update options, or you may use this option.
The results are identical.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Conditional_Update <br>
This option conditionally updates a module. That is, it will
only do an update if there are any differences between a
file and the latest version of a module. This is <br>
convenient when related changes are made to many modules in
a directory, and one command using wildcards can update just
those modules that were changed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -CReate option may be
combined with the -Update or -Conditional_Update options to
create the file if required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-CLean <br>
This option is used to remove files which match the newest
versions of modules. If a file exists which matches the
newest version of a module, then the file is deleted, <br>
otherwise it is kept. This option is used to clean up a work
directory after building a new version of a product. This
option is especially useful when used with the <br>
-ALL option. It will also accept the -Input option to
specify a directory containing the files to be cleaned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-CHeck <br>
This option is used to find out if a file does not match the
latest version of a module. If so, a message is given. If
the file does match, no output occurs. This <br>
option is thus useful to determine which files have been
modified and in need of updating. The -ALL option is
defaulted for this option, since it is usually used for all
<br>
modules. For example, <br>
fhist -CHeck <br>
will report on all files which are different than the latest
modules. If -Quick is specified, then the output will
consist of the module names with no other output. <br>
This is useful for the backquote operator in shell scripts
for referencing the modules which are out of date. The
-CHeck option will also accept the -Input option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-PRune edit <br>
This option is used to permanently remove early edits from
an edit history. This is useful if you wish to cut down on
the amount of disk space taken by an edit history <br>
file, or when you want to start another release of a file,
and want a copy of the edit history file for that new
release. The option takes an edit number to preserve, <br>
and all edits in the edit history file before that edit are
deleted, and can no longer be referenced. For example, to
keep only the current edit plus the previous 10 <br>
edits of the module file, you could use the command: <br>
fhist file -prune -10 <br>
Since the -PRune option is unrecoverable (unless backup
files are available), the fhist program asks the user to
verify that the prune is really wanted. The <br>
-Forced_Update option can be used to bypass this
verification.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ALL <br>
This option can be used with any of the action options. It
means perform the operation for all modules in the module
storage directory. Alternatively, you can specify <br>
multiple module names on the command line, and the actions
will be performed with those modules. You cannot specify
both -ALL and module names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When using multiple modules or
the -ALL option, the -Input and -Output options have a
slightly different meaning. In these cases, the -Input and
-Output arguments are a <br>
directory name which contains filenames with the same name
as the module names. If the argument is not a directory,
then an error is given. This feature is useful for <br>
example, to extract all the modules and place them into some
remote directory, as in: <br>
fhist -all -e -o tempdir</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You should be careful when
specifying numeric edit numbers for multiple modules. Most
probably, a particular edit number is not appropriate for
multiple modules, since <br>
changes corresponding to a particular edit number are not
usually related. Using named edits avoids these problems. As
an example, if you wanted to extract every module <br>
which had an edit that was named rev3, then you could use
the command: <br>
fhist -all -e rev3</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some other useful examples of
commands which use multiple modules are: <br>
fhist *.c -create <br>
fhist -check -all <br>
fhist -cu -all</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Verbose <br>
This option can be specified with any other action, and
outputs status information about the progress of the action.
This is useful for debugging of problems, or just <br>
for amusement when the system is slow or a large file is
being processed. It accepts a numeric argument to indicate
the verbosity for output. The levels are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 No output at all (except for
errors).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 Single&acirc;line output
describing action (default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 Detailed status as action
proceeds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Help <br>
Give some help on how to use the fhist program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-VERSion <br>
Show what version of fhist is running.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All options may be abbreviated;
the abbreviation is documented as the upper case letters,
all lower case letters and underscores (_) are optional. You
must use consecutive <br>
sequences of optional letters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All options are case
insensitive, you may type them in upper case or lower case
or a combination of both, case is not important.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example: the arguments
&quot;-help, &quot;-HELP&quot; and &quot;-h&quot; are all
interpreted to mean the -Help option. The argument
&quot;-hlp&quot; will not be understood, because consecutive
optional char&acirc; <br>
acters were not supplied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options and other command line
arguments may be mixed arbitrarily on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The GNU long option names are
understood. Since all option names for fhist are long, this
means ignoring the extra leading &rsquo;-&rsquo;. The
&quot;-option=value&quot; convention is also under&acirc;
<br>
stood.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILE NAME EXPANSION <br>
As a convenience, if a pathname begins with a period and a
environment variable exists with that name, then the value
of the environment variable will be used as the actual
path&acirc; <br>
name. For example, if a environment variable of .FOO has the
value this.is.a.long.name, then the command <br>
fhist -o .FOO <br>
is actually equivilant to the command <br>
fhist -o this.is.a.long.name <br>
If you want to prevent the expansion of a pathname which
begins with a period, then you can use an alternate form for
the pathname, as in: <br>
fhist -o ./.FOO</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BINARY FILES <br>
In general, fhist can handle all text files you throw at it,
even international text with unusual encodings. However,
fhist is unable to cope elegantly with files which contain
<br>
the NUL character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The fcomp(1) program simply
prints a warning, and continues, you need to know that it
converts NUL characters into an 0x80 value before performing
the comparison.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The fmerge(1) program also
converts the NUL character to an 0x80 value before merging,
after a warning, and any output file will contain this
value, rather than the original NUL <br>
character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The fhist(1) program, however,
generates a fatal error if any input file contains NUL
characters. This is intended to protect your source files
for unintentional corruption. <br>
Use -BINary for files which absolutely must contain NUL
characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The fhist program will exit with a status of 1 on any error.
The fhist program will only exit with a status of 0 if there
are no errors.</p>
