<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
NCO - netCDF Operators</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNTAX <br>
operator [ options] input-files output-file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The netCDF Operators, or NCO are a suite of programs known
as operators. Each operator is a standalone, command line
program which is executed at the UNIX shell-level like, <br>
e.g., ls or mkdir. The operators take netCDF
(&lt;http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf&gt;) files
as input, then perform a set of operations (e.g., deriving
new data, averag&acirc; <br>
ing, hyperslabbing, or metadata manipulation) and produce a
netCDF file as output. The operators are primarily designed
to aid manipulation and analysis of gridded scientific <br>
data. The single command style of NCO allows users to
manipulate and analyze files interactively and with simple
scripts, avoiding the overhead (and some of the power) of a
<br>
higher level programming environment. The NCO Users Guide
illustrates their use with examples from the field of
climate modeling and analysis.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The available operators are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ncap2, netCDF Arithmetic
Processor <br>
ncatted, netCDF Attribute Editor <br>
ncbo, netCDF Binary Operator (includes ncadd, ncsubtract,
ncmultiply, ncdivide) <br>
nces, netCDF Ensemble Averager <br>
ncecat, netCDF Ensemble Concatenator <br>
ncflint, netCDF File Interpolator <br>
ncks, netCDF Kitchen Sink <br>
ncpdq, netCDF Permute Dimensions Quickly, Pack Data Quietly
<br>
ncra, netCDF Record Averager <br>
ncrcat, netCDF Record Concatenator <br>
ncrename, netCDF Renamer <br>
ncwa, netCDF Weighted Averager. <br>
(Note that the &quot;averagers&quot; are misnamed because
they perform many non-linear operations as well, e.g.,
total, minimum, maximum, RMS).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The operators are as general as
netCDF itself: there are no restrictions on the contents of
the netCDF file(s) used as input. NCO&rsquo;s internal
routines are completely dynamic and <br>
impose no limit on the number or sizes of dimensions,
variables, and files. NCO is designed to be used both
interactively and with large batch jobs. The default
operator behav&acirc; <br>
ior is often sufficient for everyday needs, and there are
numerous command line (i.e., run-time) options, for special
cases. NCO works well on all modern operating systems.</p>

The full documentation for NCO is maintained as a Texinfo
manual called the NCO Users Guide. Because NCO is
mathematical in nature, the documentation includes
TeX-intensive por&acirc; <br>
tions not viewable on character-based displays. Hence the
only complete and authoritative versions of the NCO Users
Guide are the PDF (recommended), DVI, and Postscript
versions <br>
at &lt;http://nco.sf.net/nco.pdf&gt;,
&lt;http://nco.sf.net/nco.dvi&gt;, and
&lt;http://nco.sf.net/nco.ps&gt;, respectively. HTML and XML
versions are available at &lt;http://nco.sf.net/nco.html&gt;
<br>
and &lt;http://nco.sf.net/nco.xml&gt;, respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the info and NCO programs are
properly installed at your site, the command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">info nco</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">should give you access to the
complete manual, except for the TeX-intensive portions.</p>
