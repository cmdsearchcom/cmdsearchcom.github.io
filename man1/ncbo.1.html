<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
ncbo subtracts variables in file_2 from the corresponding
variables (those with the same name) in file_1 and stores
the results in file_3. Variables in file_2 are broadcast to
<br>
conform to the corresponding variable in file_1 if
necessary. Broadcasting a variable means creating data in
non-existing dimensions from the data in existing
dimensions. For <br>
example, a two dimensional variable in file_2 can be
subtracted from a four, three, or two (but not one or zero)
dimensional variable (of the same name) in file_1. This
func&acirc; <br>
tionality allows the user to compute anomalies from the
mean. Note that variables in file_1 are not broadcast to
conform to the dimensions in file_2. Thus, ncbo, the number
of <br>
dimensions, or rank, of any processed variable in file_1
must be greater than or equal to the rank of the same
variable in file_2. Furthermore, the size of all dimensions
common <br>
to both file_1 and file_2 must be equal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When computing anomalies from
the mean it is often the case that file_2 was created by
applying an averaging operator to a file with the same
dimensions as file_1, if not file_1 <br>
itself. In these cases, creating file_2 with ncra rather
than ncwa will cause the ncbo operation to fail. For
concreteness say the record dimension in file_1 is time. If
<br>
file_2 were created by averaging file_1 over the time
dimension with the ncra operator rather than with the ncwa
operator, then file_2 will have a time dimension of size 1
rather <br>
than having no time dimension at all In this case the input
files to ncbo, file_1 and file_2, will have unequally sized
time dimensions which causes ncbo to fail. To prevent <br>
this from occurring, use ncwa to remove the time dimension
from file_2. An example is given below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ncbo will never difference
coordinate variables or variables of type NC_CHAR or
NC_BYTE. This ensures that coordinates like (e.g., latitude
and longitude) are physically mean&acirc; <br>
ingful in the output file, file_3. This behavior is
hardcoded. ncbo applies special rules to some NCAR CSM
fields (e.g., ORO). See NCAR CSM Conventions for a complete
descrip&acirc; <br>
tion. Finally, we note that ncflint (ncflint netCDF File
Interpolator) can be also perform file subtraction (as well
as addition, multiplication and interpolation).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Say files 85_0112.nc and 86_0112.nc each contain 12 months
of data. Compute the change in the monthly averages from
1985 to 1986: <br>
ncbo 86_0112.nc 85_0112.nc 86m85_0112.nc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following examples
demonstrate the broadcasting feature of ncbo. Say we wish to
compute the monthly anomalies of T from the yearly average
of T for the year 1985. First we <br>
create the 1985 average from the monthly data, which is
stored with the record dimension time. <br>
ncra 85_0112.nc 85.nc <br>
ncwa -O -a time 85.nc 85.nc <br>
The second command, ncwa, gets rid of the time dimension of
size 1 that ncra left in 85.nc. Now none of the variables in
85.nc has a time dimension. A quicker way to accomplish <br>
this is to use ncwa from the beginning: <br>
ncwa -a time 85_0112.nc 85.nc <br>
We are now ready to use ncbo to compute the anomalies for
1985: <br>
ncbo -v T 85_0112.nc 85.nc t_anm_85_0112.nc <br>
Each of the 12 records in t_anm_85_0112.nc now contains the
monthly deviation of T from the annual mean of T for each
gridpoint.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Say we wish to compute the
monthly gridpoint anomalies from the zonal annual mean. A
zonal mean is a quantity that has been averaged over the
longitudinal (or x) direction. <br>
First we use ncwa to average over longitudinal direction
lon, creating xavg_85.nc, the zonal mean of 85.nc. Then we
use ncbo to subtract the zonal annual means from the monthly
<br>
gridpoint data: <br>
ncwa -a lon 85.nc xavg_85.nc <br>
ncbo 85_0112.nc xavg_85.nc tx_anm_85_0112.nc <br>
Assuming 85_0112.nc has dimensions time and lon, this
example only works if xavg_85.nc has no time or lon
dimension.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As a final example, say we have
five years of monthly data (i.e., 60 months) stored in
8501_8912.nc and we wish to create a file which contains the
twelve month seasonal cycle of <br>
the average monthly anomaly from the five-year mean of this
data. The following method is just one permutation of many
which will accomplish the same result. First use ncwa to
<br>
create the file containing the five-year mean: <br>
ncwa -a time 8501_8912.nc 8589.nc <br>
Next use ncbo to create a file containing the difference of
each month&rsquo;s data from the five-year mean: <br>
ncbo 8501_8912.nc 8589.nc t_anm_8501_8912.nc <br>
Now use ncks to group the five January anomalies together in
one file, and use ncra to create the average anomaly for all
five Januarys. These commands are embedded in a shell <br>
loop so they are repeated for all twelve months: <br>
foreach idx (01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 12) <br>
ncks -F -d time,,,12 t_anm_8501_8912.nc foo. <br>
ncra foo. t_anm_8589_.nc <br>
end <br>
Note that ncra understands the stride argument so the two
commands inside the loop may be combined into the single
command <br>
ncra -F -d time,,,12 t_anm_8501_8912.nc foo. <br>
Finally, use ncrcat to concatenate the 12 average monthly
anomaly files into one twelve-record file which contains the
entire seasonal cycle of the monthly anomalies: <br>
ncrcat t_anm_8589_??.nc t_anm_8589_0112.nc</p>
