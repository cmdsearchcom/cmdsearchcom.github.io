<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
In the simplest case <b>strace</b> runs the specified <i>command</i> until it
  exits. It intercepts and records the system calls which are called by a
  process and the signals which are received by a process. The name of each
  system call, its arguments and its return value are printed on standard error
  or to the file specified with the <b>-o</b> option.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>strace</b> is a useful diagnostic, instructional, and debugging tool. System
  administrators, diagnosticians and trouble-shooters will find it invaluable
  for solving problems with programs for which the source is not readily
  available since they do not need to be recompiled in order to trace them.
  Students, hackers and the overly-curious will find that a great deal can be
  learned about a system and its system calls by tracing even ordinary programs.
  And programmers will find that since system calls and signals are events that
  happen at the user/kernel interface, a close examination of this boundary is
  very useful for bug isolation, sanity checking and attempting to capture race
  conditions.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Each line in the trace contains the system call name, followed by its arguments
  in parentheses and its return value. An example from stracing the command
  ``cat /dev/null'' is:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
open(&quot;/dev/null&quot;, O_RDONLY) = 3
</pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Errors (typically a return value of -1) have the errno symbol and error string
  appended.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
open(&quot;/foo/bar&quot;, O_RDONLY) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
</pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Signals are printed as a signal symbol and a signal string. An excerpt from
  stracing and interrupting the command ``sleep 666'' is:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
sigsuspend([] &lt;unfinished ...&gt;
--- SIGINT (Interrupt) ---
+++ killed by SIGINT +++
</pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If a system call is being executed and meanwhile another one is being called
  from a different thread/process then <b>strace</b> will try to preserve the
  order of those events and mark the ongoing call as being <i>unfinished</i>.
  When the call returns it will be marked as <i>resumed</i>.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
[pid 28772] select(4, [3], NULL, NULL, NULL &lt;unfinished ...&gt;
[pid 28779] clock_gettime(CLOCK_REALTIME, {1130322148, 939977000}) = 0
[pid 28772] &lt;... select resumed&gt; )      = 1 (in [3])
</pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Interruption of a (restartable) system call by a signal delivery is processed
  differently as kernel terminates the system call and also arranges its
  immediate reexecution after the signal handler completes.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
read(0, 0x7ffff72cf5cf, 1)              = ? ERESTARTSYS (To be restarted)
--- SIGALRM (Alarm clock) @ 0 (0) ---
rt_sigreturn(0xe)                       = 0
read(0, &quot;&quot;..., 1)                       = 0
</pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Arguments are printed in symbolic form with a passion. This example shows the
  shell performing ``&gt;&gt;xyzzy'' output redirection:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
open(&quot;xyzzy&quot;, O_WRONLY|O_APPEND|O_CREAT, 0666) = 3
</pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Here the third argument of open is decoded by breaking down the flag argument
  into its three bitwise-OR constituents and printing the mode value in octal by
  tradition. Where traditional or native usage differs from ANSI or POSIX, the
  latter forms are preferred. In some cases, <b>strace</b> output has proven to
  be more readable than the source.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Structure pointers are dereferenced and the members are displayed as
  appropriate. In all cases arguments are formatted in the most C-like fashion
  possible. For example, the essence of the command ``ls -l /dev/null'' is
  captured as:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
lstat(&quot;/dev/null&quot;, {st_mode=S_IFCHR|0666, st_rdev=makedev(1, 3), ...}) = 0
</pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Notice how the `struct stat' argument is dereferenced and how each member is
  displayed symbolically. In particular, observe how the st_mode member is
  carefully decoded into a bitwise-OR of symbolic and numeric values. Also
  notice in this example that the first argument to lstat is an input to the
  system call and the second argument is an output. Since output arguments are
  not modified if the system call fails, arguments may not always be
  dereferenced. For example, retrying the ``ls -l'' example with a non-existent
  file produces the following line:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
lstat(&quot;/foo/bar&quot;, 0xb004) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
</pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
In this case the porch light is on but nobody is home.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Character pointers are dereferenced and printed as C strings. Non-printing
  characters in strings are normally represented by ordinary C escape codes.
  Only the first <i>strsize</i> (32 by default) bytes of strings are printed;
  longer strings have an ellipsis appended following the closing quote. Here is
  a line from ``ls -l'' where the <b>getpwuid</b> library routine is reading the
  password file:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
read(3, &quot;root::0:0:System Administrator:/&quot;..., 1024) = 422
</pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
While structures are annotated using curly braces, simple pointers and arrays
  are printed using square brackets with commas separating elements. Here is an
  example from the command ``id'' on a system with supplementary group ids:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
getgroups(32, [100, 0]) = 2
</pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
On the other hand, bit-sets are also shown using square brackets but set
  elements are separated only by a space. Here is the shell preparing to execute
  an external command:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
sigprocmask(SIG_BLOCK, [CHLD TTOU], []) = 0
</pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Here the second argument is a bit-set of two signals, SIGCHLD and SIGTTOU. In
  some cases the bit-set is so full that printing out the unset elements is more
  valuable. In that case, the bit-set is prefixed by a tilde like this:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
sigprocmask(SIG_UNBLOCK, ~[], NULL) = 0
</pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Here the second argument represents the full set of all signals.

When <i>command</i> exits, <b>strace</b> exits with the same exit status. If
  <i>command</i> is terminated by a signal, <b>strace</b> terminates itself with
  the same signal, so that <b>strace</b> can be used as a wrapper process
  transparent to the invoking parent process.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When using <b>-p</b>, the exit status of <b>strace</b> is zero unless there was
  an unexpected error in doing the tracing.

If <b>strace</b> is installed setuid to root then the invoking user will be able
  to attach to and trace processes owned by any user. In addition setuid and
  setgid programs will be executed and traced with the correct effective
  privileges. Since only users trusted with full root privileges should be
  allowed to do these things, it only makes sense to install <b>strace</b> as
  setuid to root when the users who can execute it are restricted to those users
  who have this trust. For example, it makes sense to install a special version
  of <b>strace</b> with mode `rwsr-xr--', user <b>root</b> and group
  <b>trace</b>, where members of the <b>trace</b> group are trusted users. If
  you do use this feature, please remember to install a non-setuid version of
  <b>strace</b> for ordinary lusers to use.

It is a pity that so much tracing clutter is produced by systems employing
  shared libraries.
<div class="Pp"></div>
It is instructive to think about system call inputs and outputs as data-flow
  across the user/kernel boundary. Because user-space and kernel-space are
  separate and address-protected, it is sometimes possible to make deductive
  inferences about process behavior using inputs and outputs as propositions.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In some cases, a system call will differ from the documented behavior or have a
  different name. For example, on System V-derived systems the true
  <b>time</b>(2) system call does not take an argument and the <b>stat</b>
  function is called <b>xstat</b> and takes an extra leading argument. These
  discrepancies are normal but idiosyncratic characteristics of the system call
  interface and are accounted for by C library wrapper functions.
<div class="Pp"></div>
On some platforms a process that has a system call trace applied to it with the
  <b>-p</b> option will receive a <b>SIGSTOP</b>. This signal may interrupt a
  system call that is not restartable. This may have an unpredictable effect on
  the process if the process takes no action to restart the system call.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="BUGS"><a class="selflink" href="#BUGS">BUGS</a></h1>
Programs that use the <i>setuid</i> bit do not have effective user
  <small>ID</small> privileges while being traced.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A traced process runs slowly.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Traced processes which are descended from <i>command</i> may be left running
  after an interrupt signal (<small>CTRL-C).</small>

The <b>-i</b> option is weakly supported.

<b>strace</b> The original <b>strace</b> was written by Paul Kranenburg for
  SunOS and was inspired by its trace utility. The SunOS version of
  <b>strace</b> was ported to Linux and enhanced by Branko Lankester, who also
  wrote the Linux kernel support. Even though Paul released <b>strace</b> 2.5 in
  1992, Branko's work was based on Paul's <b>strace</b> 1.5 release from 1991.
  In 1993, Rick Sladkey merged <b>strace</b> 2.5 for SunOS and the second
  release of <b>strace</b> for Linux, added many of the features of
  <b>truss</b>(1) from SVR4, and produced an <b>strace</b> that worked on both
  platforms. In 1994 Rick ported <b>strace</b> to SVR4 and Solaris and wrote the
  automatic configuration support. In 1995 he ported <b>strace</b> to Irix and
  tired of writing about himself in the third person.

Problems with <b>strace</b> should be reported to the <b>strace</b> mailing list
