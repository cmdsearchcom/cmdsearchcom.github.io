<p>STRACE(1) General Commands Manual STRACE(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
strace - trace system calls and signals</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
strace [-CdffhiqrtttTvVxxy] [-In] [-bexecve] [-eexpr]...
[-acolumn] [-ofile] [-sstrsize] [-Ppath]... -ppid... / [-D]
[-Evar[=val]]... [-uusername] command [args]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">strace -c[df] [-In] [-bexecve]
[-eexpr]... [-Ooverhead] [-Ssortby] -ppid... / [-D]
[-Evar[=val]]... [-uusername] command [args]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
In the simplest case strace runs the specified command until
it exits. It intercepts and records the system calls which
are called by a process and the signals which are <br>
received by a process. The name of each system call, its
arguments and its return value are printed on standard error
or to the file specified with the -o option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">strace is a useful diagnostic,
instructional, and debugging tool. System administrators,
diagnosticians and trouble-shooters will find it invaluable
for solving problems with <br>
programs for which the source is not readily available since
they do not need to be recompiled in order to trace them.
Students, hackers and the overly-curious will find that a
<br>
great deal can be learned about a system and its system
calls by tracing even ordinary programs. And programmers
will find that since system calls and signals are events
that <br>
happen at the user/kernel interface, a close examination of
this boundary is very useful for bug isolation, sanity
checking and attempting to capture race conditions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each line in the trace contains
the system call name, followed by its arguments in
parentheses and its return value. An example from stracing
the command &lsquo;&lsquo;cat /dev/null&rsquo;&rsquo;
is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">open(&quot;/dev/null&quot;,
O_RDONLY) = 3</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Errors (typically a return value
of -1) have the errno symbol and error string appended.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">open(&quot;/foo/bar&quot;,
O_RDONLY) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Signals are printed as a signal
symbol and a signal string. An excerpt from stracing and
interrupting the command &lsquo;&lsquo;sleep
666&rsquo;&rsquo; is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sigsuspend([] &lt;unfinished
...&gt; <br>
--- SIGINT (Interrupt) --- <br>
+++ killed by SIGINT +++</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a system call is being
executed and meanwhile another one is being called from a
different thread/process then strace will try to preserve
the order of those events and mark <br>
the ongoing call as being unfinished. When the call returns
it will be marked as resumed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[pid 28772] select(4, [3], NULL,
NULL, NULL &lt;unfinished ...&gt; <br>
[pid 28779] clock_gettime(CLOCK_REALTIME, {1130322148,
939977000}) = 0 <br>
[pid 28772] &lt;... select resumed&gt; ) = 1 (in [3])</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Interruption of a (restartable)
system call by a signal delivery is processed differently as
kernel terminates the system call and also arranges its
immediate reexecution after <br>
the signal handler completes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">read(0, 0x7ffff72cf5cf, 1) = ?
ERESTARTSYS (To be restarted) <br>
--- SIGALRM (Alarm clock) @ 0 (0) --- <br>
rt_sigreturn(0xe) = 0 <br>
read(0, &quot;&quot;..., 1) = 0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Arguments are printed in
symbolic form with a passion. This example shows the shell
performing &lsquo;&lsquo;&gt;&gt;xyzzy&rsquo;&rsquo; output
redirection:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">open(&quot;xyzzy&quot;,
O_WRONLY|O_APPEND|O_CREAT, 0666) = 3</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here the third argument of open
is decoded by breaking down the flag argument into its three
bitwise-OR constituents and printing the mode value in octal
by tradition. Where <br>
traditional or native usage differs from ANSI or POSIX, the
latter forms are preferred. In some cases, strace output has
proven to be more readable than the source.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Structure pointers are
dereferenced and the members are displayed as appropriate.
In all cases arguments are formatted in the most C-like
fashion possible. For example, the <br>
essence of the command &lsquo;&lsquo;ls -l
/dev/null&rsquo;&rsquo; is captured as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lstat(&quot;/dev/null&quot;,
{st_mode=S_IFCHR|0666, st_rdev=makedev(1, 3), ...}) = 0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Notice how the &lsquo;struct
stat&rsquo; argument is dereferenced and how each member is
displayed symbolically. In particular, observe how the
st_mode member is carefully decoded into a <br>
bitwise-OR of symbolic and numeric values. Also notice in
this example that the first argument to lstat is an input to
the system call and the second argument is an output. <br>
Since output arguments are not modified if the system call
fails, arguments may not always be dereferenced. For
example, retrying the &lsquo;&lsquo;ls -l&rsquo;&rsquo;
example with a non-existent file <br>
produces the following line:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lstat(&quot;/foo/bar&quot;,
0xb004) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In this case the porch light is
on but nobody is home.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Character pointers are
dereferenced and printed as C strings. Non-printing
characters in strings are normally represented by ordinary C
escape codes. Only the first strsize (32 <br>
by default) bytes of strings are printed; longer strings
have an ellipsis appended following the closing quote. Here
is a line from &lsquo;&lsquo;ls -l&rsquo;&rsquo; where the
getpwuid library routine <br>
is reading the password file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">read(3, &quot;root::0:0:System
Administrator:/&quot;..., 1024) = 422</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">While structures are annotated
using curly braces, simple pointers and arrays are printed
using square brackets with commas separating elements. Here
is an example from the com&acirc; <br>
mand &lsquo;&lsquo;id&rsquo;&rsquo; on a system with
supplementary group ids:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">getgroups(32, [100, 0]) = 2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On the other hand, bit-sets are
also shown using square brackets but set elements are
separated only by a space. Here is the shell preparing to
execute an external command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sigprocmask(SIG_BLOCK, [CHLD
TTOU], []) = 0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here the second argument is a
bit-set of two signals, SIGCHLD and SIGTTOU. In some cases
the bit-set is so full that printing out the unset elements
is more valuable. In that <br>
case, the bit-set is prefixed by a tilde like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sigprocmask(SIG_UNBLOCK, ~[],
NULL) = 0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here the second argument
represents the full set of all signals.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-c Count time, calls, and errors for each system call and
report a summary on program exit. On Linux, this attempts to
show system time (CPU time spent running in the <br>
kernel) independent of wall clock time. If -c is used with
-f or -F (below), only aggregate totals for all traced
processes are kept.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C Like -c but also print
regular output while processes are running.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D Run tracer process as a
detached grandchild, not as parent of the tracee. This
reduces the visible effect of strace by keeping the tracee a
direct child of the call&acirc; <br>
ing process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Show some debugging output of
strace itself on the standard error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Trace child processes as they
are created by currently traced processes as a result of the
fork(2), vfork(2) and clone(2) system calls. Note that -p
PID -f will <br>
attach all threads of process PID if it is multi-threaded,
not only thread with thread_id = PID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ff If the -o filename option is
in effect, each processes trace is written to filename.pid
where pid is the numeric process id of each process. This is
incompatible <br>
with -c, since no per-process counts are kept.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F This option is now obsolete
and it has the same functionality as -f.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Print the help summary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i Print the instruction pointer
at the time of the system call.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Suppress messages about
attaching, detaching etc. This happens automatically when
output is redirected to a file and the command is run
directly instead of attach&acirc; <br>
ing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-qq If given twice, suppress
messages about process exit status.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Print a relative timestamp
upon entry to each system call. This records the time
difference between the beginning of successive system
calls.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Prefix each line of the trace
with the time of day.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-tt If given twice, the time
printed will include the microseconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ttt If given thrice, the time
printed will include the microseconds and the leading
portion will be printed as the number of seconds since the
epoch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T Show the time spent in system
calls. This records the time difference between the
beginning and the end of each system call.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Print unabbreviated versions
of environment, stat, termios, etc. calls. These structures
are very common in calls and so the default behavior
displays a reasonable <br>
subset of structure members. Use this option to get all of
the gory details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Print the version number of
strace.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x Print all non-ASCII strings
in hexadecimal string format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-xx Print all strings in
hexadecimal string format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-y Print paths associated with
file descriptor arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a column Align return values in
a specific column (default column 40).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b syscall If specified syscall
is reached, detach from traced process. Currently, only
execve syscall is supported. This option is useful if you
want to trace multi-threaded <br>
process and therefore require -f, but don&rsquo;t want to
trace its (potentially very complex) children.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e expr A qualifying expression
which modifies which events to trace or how to trace them.
The format of the expression is:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">[qualifier=][!]value1[,value2]...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where qualifier is one of trace,
abbrev, verbose, raw, signal, read, or write and value is a
qualifier-dependent symbol or number. The default qualifier
is trace. <br>
Using an exclamation mark negates the set of values. For
example, -e open means literally -e trace=open which in turn
means trace only the open system call. By con&acirc; <br>
trast, -e trace=!open means to trace every system call
except open. In addition, the special values all and none
have the obvious meanings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that some shells use the
exclamation point for history expansion even inside quoted
arguments. If so, you must escape the exclamation point with
a backslash.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e trace=set <br>
Trace only the specified set of system calls. The -c option
is useful for determining which system calls might be useful
to trace. For example, <br>
trace=open,close,read,write means to only trace those four
system calls. Be careful when making inferences about the
user/kernel boundary if only a subset of system <br>
calls are being monitored. The default is trace=all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e trace=file <br>
Trace all system calls which take a file name as an
argument. You can think of this as an abbreviation for -e
trace=open,stat,chmod,unlink,... which is useful to <br>
seeing what files the process is referencing. Furthermore,
using the abbreviation will ensure that you don&rsquo;t
accidentally forget to include a call like lstat in the <br>
list. Betchya woulda forgot that one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e trace=process <br>
Trace all system calls which involve process management.
This is useful for watching the fork, wait, and exec steps
of a process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e trace=network <br>
Trace all the network related system calls.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e trace=signal <br>
Trace all signal related system calls.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e trace=ipc <br>
Trace all IPC related system calls.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e trace=desc <br>
Trace all file descriptor related system calls.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e trace=memory <br>
Trace all memory mapping related system calls.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e abbrev=set <br>
Abbreviate the output from printing each member of large
structures. The default is abbrev=all. The -v option has the
effect of abbrev=none.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e verbose=set <br>
Dereference structures for the specified set of system
calls. The default is verbose=all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e raw=set Print raw, undecoded
arguments for the specified set of system calls. This option
has the effect of causing all arguments to be printed in
hexadecimal. This is <br>
mostly useful if you don&rsquo;t trust the decoding or you
need to know the actual numeric value of an argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e signal=set <br>
Trace only the specified subset of signals. The default is
signal=all. For example, signal =! SIGIO (or signal=!io)
causes SIGIO signals not to be traced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e read=set Perform a full
hexadecimal and ASCII dump of all the data read from file
descriptors listed in the specified set. For example, to see
all input activity on file <br>
descriptors 3 and 5 use -e read=3,5. Note that this is
independent from the normal tracing of the read(2) system
call which is controlled by the option <br>
-e trace=read.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e write=set <br>
Perform a full hexadecimal and ASCII dump of all the data
written to file descriptors listed in the specified set. For
example, to see all output activity on file <br>
descriptors 3 and 5 use -e write=3,5. Note that this is
independent from the normal tracing of the write(2) system
call which is controlled by the option <br>
-e trace=write.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I interruptible <br>
When strace can be interrupted by signals (such as pressing
^C). 1: no signals are blocked; 2: fatal signals are blocked
while decoding syscall (default); 3: fatal <br>
signals are always blocked (default if &rsquo;-o FILE
PROG&rsquo;); 4: fatal signals and SIGTSTP (^Z) are always
blocked (useful to make strace -o FILE PROG not stop on
^Z).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o filename Write the trace
output to the file filename rather than to stderr. Use
filename.pid if -ff is used. If the argument begins with
&lsquo;|&rsquo; or with &lsquo;!&rsquo; then the rest of the
<br>
argument is treated as a command and all output is piped to
it. This is convenient for piping the debugging output to a
program without affecting the redirections of <br>
executed programs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O overhead Set the overhead for
tracing system calls to overhead microseconds. This is
useful for overriding the default heuristic for guessing how
much time is spent in mere <br>
measuring when timing system calls using the -c option. The
accuracy of the heuristic can be gauged by timing a given
program run without tracing (using time(1)) and <br>
comparing the accumulated system call time to the total
produced using -c.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p pid Attach to the process
with the process ID pid and begin tracing. The trace may be
terminated at any time by a keyboard interrupt signal
(CTRL-C). strace will <br>
respond by detaching itself from the traced process(es)
leaving it (them) to continue running. Multiple -p options
can be used to attach to many processes. -p <br>
&quot;&lsquo;pidof PROG&lsquo;&quot; syntax is
supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P path Trace only system calls
accessing path. Multiple -P options can be used to specify
several paths.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s strsize Specify the maximum
string size to print (the default is 32). Note that
filenames are not considered strings and are always printed
in full.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S sortby Sort the output of the
histogram printed by the -c option by the specified
criterion. Legal values are time, calls, name, and nothing
(default is time).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u username Run command with the
user ID, group ID, and supplementary groups of username.
This option is only useful when running as root and enables
the correct execution of <br>
setuid and/or setgid binaries. Unless this option is used
setuid and setgid programs are executed without effective
privileges.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E var=val Run command with
var=val in its list of environment variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E var Remove var from the
inherited list of environment variables before passing it on
to the command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
When command exits, strace exits with the same exit status.
If command is terminated by a signal, strace terminates
itself with the same signal, so that strace can be used as a
<br>
wrapper process transparent to the invoking parent
process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When using -p, the exit status
of strace is zero unless there was an unexpected error in
doing the tracing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SETUID INSTALLATION <br>
If strace is installed setuid to root then the invoking user
will be able to attach to and trace processes owned by any
user. In addition setuid and setgid programs will be
exe&acirc; <br>
cuted and traced with the correct effective privileges.
Since only users trusted with full root privileges should be
allowed to do these things, it only makes sense to install
<br>
strace as setuid to root when the users who can execute it
are restricted to those users who have this trust. For
example, it makes sense to install a special version of
strace <br>
with mode &lsquo;rwsr-xr--&rsquo;, user root and group
trace, where members of the trace group are trusted users.
If you do use this feature, please remember to install a
non-setuid version <br>
of strace for ordinary lusers to use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
ltrace(1), time(1), ptrace(2), proc(5)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
It is a pity that so much tracing clutter is produced by
systems employing shared libraries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is instructive to think about
system call inputs and outputs as data-flow across the
user/kernel boundary. Because user-space and kernel-space
are separate and address-pro&acirc; <br>
tected, it is sometimes possible to make deductive
inferences about process behavior using inputs and outputs
as propositions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In some cases, a system call
will differ from the documented behavior or have a different
name. For example, on System V-derived systems the true
time(2) system call does not <br>
take an argument and the stat function is called xstat and
takes an extra leading argument. These discrepancies are
normal but idiosyncratic characteristics of the system call
<br>
interface and are accounted for by C library wrapper
functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On some platforms a process that
has a system call trace applied to it with the -p option
will receive a SIGSTOP. This signal may interrupt a system
call that is not <br>
restartable. This may have an unpredictable effect on the
process if the process takes no action to restart the system
call.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Programs that use the setuid bit do not have effective user
ID privileges while being traced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A traced process runs
slowly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Traced processes which are
descended from command may be left running after an
interrupt signal (CTRL-C).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -i option is weakly
supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY <br>
strace The original strace was written by Paul Kranenburg
for SunOS and was inspired by its trace utility. The SunOS
version of strace was ported to Linux and enhanced by Branko
<br>
Lankester, who also wrote the Linux kernel support. Even
though Paul released strace 2.5 in 1992, Branko&rsquo;s work
was based on Paul&rsquo;s strace 1.5 release from 1991. In
1993, Rick <br>
Sladkey merged strace 2.5 for SunOS and the second release
of strace for Linux, added many of the features of truss(1)
from SVR4, and produced an strace that worked on both
plat&acirc; <br>
forms. In 1994 Rick ported strace to SVR4 and Solaris and
wrote the automatic configuration support. In 1995 he ported
strace to Irix and tired of writing about himself in the
<br>
third person.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROBLEMS <br>
Problems with strace should be reported to the strace
mailing list at
&lt;strace-devel@lists.sourceforge.net&gt;.</p>
