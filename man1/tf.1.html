<p>TF(1) General Commands Manual TF(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
tf - TinyFugue, a MUD client</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
tf [-ffile] [-lnq] [world] <br>
tf [-ffile] host port</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
TinyFugue (also known as &quot;Fugue&quot; or
&quot;TF&quot;) is a line-based client designed for
connecting to MUD servers (note: LP, DIKU, and other servers
which use prompts require &quot;/lp on&quot;; see <br>
/help prompts).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most of the TF documentation is
in the help file, which may be read online with the
&quot;/help&quot; command. This manual page may be obsolete
in certain areas; however, the helpfile <br>
will always be up to date.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TinyFugue is larger than most
MUD clients, but has many more features and is much more
flexible. The goal is to provide the most functionality in a
client that still maintains <br>
the user-friendliness of Tinytalk. Clients with extension
languages such as Tcltt or VaporTalk can do a little more in
certain areas, but are considerably harder to use and <br>
learn. TF provides most of these abilities in such a manner
that learning to use any one function is relatively
easy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Because I am continually adding
new features and changing the code, TF sometimes becomes
less stable in a new release. Versions labled
&quot;alpha&quot; are generally not as well tested <br>
as &quot;beta&quot; versions, so they have the potential for
more bugs. For this reason, I leave some older versions at
the site where I distribute TF, which do not have all the
current <br>
features but may have fewer bugs than the most recent
release.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS <br>
With no arguments, TF will try to connect to the first world
defined in the configuration file(s).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With a world argument, TF will
try to connect to world, as defined in the configuration
file. If world is omitted, it will try to connect to the
first world defined in your con&acirc; <br>
figuration files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With host and port arguments, TF
will define a temporary world and try to connect to it. The
host may be an IP number or regular name format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ffile Load file instead of
$HOME/.tfrc at startup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Do not load any personal
configuration file. The library will still be loaded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l Disable automatic login.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Do not connect to any world
at startup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Quiet login (overrides
%{quiet} flag).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FEATURES <br>
Among other things, TF allows you to:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Divide the screen into two
parts, for input and output, with flexible handling of input
(/visual mode).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Connect to multiple worlds and
switch between them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Wrap MUD output at the edge of
the screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Edit text in the input
buffer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Recall previous commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Modify key sequences used to
perform editing functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bind commands to key
sequences.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Define complex macros to perform
MUD tasks easily.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Create triggers which
automatically perform certain tasks when certain output is
received from the MUD.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Modify existing macros using
either a command format or interactive editing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Support &quot;portals&quot; that
automatically switch from world to world.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hilite or color all or part of a
line that matches a certain pattern.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Gag lines that match certain
patterns.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Suppress frequently repeated
text (&quot;spamming&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Automatically log into a
character on a world.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Send a text file to the MUD in
flexible ways, or echo it locally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Send the output of a system
command to the MUD, or echo it locally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Send text previously received
from the MUD to the MUD, or echo it locally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Repeat a MUD or TF command a
number of times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Do the above four things at
varying intervals, or at a rapid-fire rate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Log a session to a file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Separate LP and Diku style
prompts from normal output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Page output using a --More--
prompt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Recall previously received
text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION FILES <br>
TF will attempt to read two files when starting. The first
is a public configuration file &quot;stdlib.tf&quot;,
located in TFLIBDIR. TFLIBDIR is defined when TF is
installed, and is <br>
often /usr/local/lib/tf.lib, or under the home directory of
the installer. This library contains many macros and
definitions essential to the correct operation of TF.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Next, TF will attempt to read
your personal configuration file, $HOME/.tfrc, in which you
can put any TF commands you want executed automatically at
startup. Two of the most <br>
useful commands to use in a TF configuration file are
/addworld and /load.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For backward compatability, TF
will also try to read the TinyTalk configuration file. Its
name defautls to $HOME/.tinytalk, or can be defined by the
TINYTALK environment vari&acirc; <br>
able. This file may start with a list of worlds that will be
defined as if with /addworld.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY <br>
Anton Rang (Tarrant) in February of 1990 released Tinytalk,
the first Tinyclient with any great number of features,
including hiliting and suppression of text, simple triggers,
<br>
and separating input and output on the screen. Leo Plotkin
(Grod) made rather extensive modifications to Tinytalk to
produce Tinywar, which was plagued with some serious bugs
<br>
and was never officially released (the phrase &quot;Tinywar
doesn&rsquo;t exist&quot; is often quoted), and is now an
unsupported client. TF began when Greg Hudson (Explorer_Bob)
merged many of <br>
the new features of Tinywar back into TinyTalk, and added
many new features of his own, most notably the split screen.
Some of the code in Greg&rsquo;s releases was contributed by
Leo <br>
Plotkin. After Greg moved on to VaporTalk, Ken Keys
(Hawkeye) took over design and maintenance of TF in July
1991, and continues to make improvements in features and
perfor&acirc; <br>
mance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The code size of TF has
surpassed 300K (unstripped), and is signifigantly larger
than Tinytalk. It is, in fact, more than three times the
size of a number of existing servers. <br>
As of version 3.0, it has 66 builtin commands and 57 library
commands, each documented in the helpfile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It has been stated that TF is
the most-used client in MUDdom at the current time. I
haven&rsquo;t taken a poll, but I wouldn&rsquo;t be
surprised.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REVIEWS <br>
TF has significantly changed the tinyclient world. It has a
number of merits and a number of flaws, and has frequently
been criticized (mostly out of boredom; nobody takes this
<br>
business too seriously) as having too many features and
being too damn big.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;Tinywar doesn&rsquo;t
exist; TinyFugue merely shouldn&rsquo;t.&quot; -- Coined by
Woodlock, I believe.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;TinyFugue is a work of
art.&quot; -- Binder, obviously after having too much to
drink.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;TinyFugue is the biggest
hack since the platform it was built on.&quot; --
Explorer_Bob, in one of his lucid moments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The New York Times, the
Christian Science Monitor and the Washington Post all
refused to comment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TF is currently supported by Ken
Keys, who may be contacted by e-mail at
kenkeys@users.sourceforge.net or kkeys@ucsd.edu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BACKWARD INCOMPATIBILTIES <br>
VERSION 3.2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/rand has been replaced with
rand(). Color names can no longer be user defined (but color
codes still can). The &quot;=&quot; operator does
comparison, not assignment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VERSION 3.1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Added type argument to WORLD and
LOGIN hooks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VERSION 3.0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Backslashes in macros are
interpreted slightly differently than in previous versions.
Turning on the &quot;backslash&quot; flag will enable the
old behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VERSION 2.1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The CONNECT hook is now called
before the LOGIN hook. In 2.0, CONNECT was called after
autologin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VERSION 2.0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In versions prior to 2.0,
&lt;space&gt; was used to scroll the pager; 2.0 uses
&lt;tab&gt; as the default, to allow the pager to be
nonblocking.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tinytalk style name gags and
hilites are no longer supported. You must use the
&rsquo;*&rsquo; wildcard explicitly, as in &rsquo;/hilite
hawkeye*&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tinytalk style page and whisper
hilites are no longer supported. However, /hilite_page and
/hilite_whisper macros are provided in the default macro
library.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The .tinytalk file may not be
supported in the future; use .tfrc instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &rsquo;-&rsquo; command line
option in versions prior to 2.0 is no longer supported, and
has been replaced with &rsquo;-l&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
When unterbamfing, the old connection should not be closed
until the new connection succeeds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a shell quote (/quote !)
reads a partial line from the pipe, the read will block
until the rest of the line is read.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WARNINGS <br>
The Surgeon General has determined that MUDding can be
detrimental to your GPA.</p>
