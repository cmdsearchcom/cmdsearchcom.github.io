tf - TinyFugue, a MUD client

<i>TinyFugue</i> (also known as &quot;Fugue&quot; or &quot;TF&quot;) is a
  line-based client designed for connecting to MUD servers (note: LP, DIKU, and
  other servers which use prompts require &quot;/lp on&quot;; see /help
  prompts).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Most of the <i>TF</i> documentation is in the help file, which may be read
  online with the &quot;/help&quot; command. This manual page may be obsolete in
  certain areas; however, the helpfile will always be up to date.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>TinyFugue</i> is larger than most MUD clients, but has many more features and
  is much more flexible. The goal is to provide the most functionality in a
  client that still maintains the user-friendliness of <i>Tinytalk</i>. Clients
  with extension languages such as <i>Tcltt</i> or <i>VaporTalk</i> can do a
  little more in certain areas, but are considerably harder to use and learn.
  <i>TF</i> provides most of these abilities in such a manner that learning to
  use any one function is relatively easy.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Because I am continually adding new features and changing the code, <i>TF</i>
  sometimes becomes less stable in a new release. Versions labled
  &quot;alpha&quot; are generally not as well tested as &quot;beta&quot;
  versions, so they have the potential for more bugs. For this reason, I leave
  some older versions at the site where I distribute <i>TF</i>, which do not
  have all the current features but may have fewer bugs than the most recent
  release.

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="COMMAND_LINE_ARGUMENTS"><a class="selflink" href="#COMMAND_LINE_ARGUMENTS">COMMAND
  LINE ARGUMENTS</a></h1>
With no arguments, <i>TF</i> will try to connect to the first world defined in
  the configuration file(s).
<div class="Pp"></div>
With a <b>world</b> argument, <i>TF</i> will try to connect to <b>world</b>, as
  defined in the configuration file. If <b>world</b> is omitted, it will try to
  connect to the first world defined in your configuration files.
<div class="Pp"></div>
With <b>host</b> and <b>port</b> arguments, <i>TF</i> will define a temporary
  world and try to connect to it. The <b>host</b> may be an IP number or regular
  name format.

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CONFIGURATION_FILES"><a class="selflink" href="#CONFIGURATION_FILES">CONFIGURATION
  FILES</a></h1>
<i>TF</i> will attempt to read two files when starting. The first is a public
  configuration file &quot;stdlib.tf&quot;, located in TFLIBDIR. TFLIBDIR is
  defined when <i>TF</i> is installed, and is often /usr/local/lib/tf.lib, or
  under the home directory of the installer. This library contains many macros
  and definitions essential to the correct operation of <i>TF.</i>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Next, <i>TF</i> will attempt to read your personal configuration file,
  $HOME/.tfrc, in which you can put any <i>TF</i> commands you want executed
  automatically at startup. Two of the most useful commands to use in a
  <i>TF</i> configuration file are /addworld and /load.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
For backward compatability, <i>TF</i> will also try to read the <i>TinyTalk</i>
  configuration file. Its name defautls to $HOME/.tinytalk, or can be defined by
  the TINYTALK environment variable. This file may start with a list of worlds
  that will be defined as if with /addworld.

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="HISTORY"><a class="selflink" href="#HISTORY">HISTORY</a></h1>
Anton Rang (Tarrant) in February of 1990 released <i>Tinytalk</i>, the first
  Tinyclient with any great number of features, including hiliting and
  suppression of text, simple triggers, and separating input and output on the
  screen. Leo Plotkin (Grod) made rather extensive modifications to
  <i>Tinytalk</i> to produce <i>Tinywar,</i> which was plagued with some serious
  bugs and was never officially released (the phrase &quot;Tinywar doesn't
  exist&quot; is often quoted), and is now an unsupported client. <i>TF</i>
  began when Greg Hudson (Explorer_Bob) merged many of the new features of
  <i>Tinywar</i> back into <i>TinyTalk,</i> and added many new features of his
  own, most notably the split screen. Some of the code in Greg's releases was
  contributed by Leo Plotkin. After Greg moved on to <i>VaporTalk,</i> Ken Keys
  (Hawkeye) took over design and maintenance of <i>TF</i> in July 1991, and
  continues to make improvements in features and performance.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The code size of <i>TF</i> has surpassed 300K (unstripped), and is signifigantly
  larger than <i>Tinytalk.</i> It is, in fact, more than three times the size of
  a number of existing servers. As of version 3.0, it has 66 builtin commands
  and 57 library commands, each documented in the helpfile.
<div class="Pp"></div>
It has been stated that <i>TF</i> is the most-used client in MUDdom at the
  current time. I haven't taken a poll, but I wouldn't be surprised.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="REVIEWS"><a class="selflink" href="#REVIEWS">REVIEWS</a></h1>
<i>TF</i> has significantly changed the tinyclient world. It has a number of
  merits and a number of flaws, and has frequently been criticized (mostly out
  of boredom; nobody takes this business too seriously) as having too many
  features and being too damn big.
<div class="Pp"></div>
	&quot;Tinywar doesn't exist; TinyFugue merely shouldn't.&quot; -- Coined by
  Woodlock, I believe.
<div class="Pp"></div>
	&quot;TinyFugue is a work of art.&quot; -- Binder, obviously after having too
  much to drink.
<div class="Pp"></div>
	&quot;TinyFugue is the biggest hack since the platform it was built on.&quot;
  -- Explorer_Bob, in one of his lucid moments.

The New York Times, the Christian Science Monitor and the Washington Post all
  refused to comment.

VERSION 3.2
<div class="Pp"></div>
/rand has been replaced with rand(). Color names can no longer be user defined
  (but color codes still can). The &quot;=&quot; operator does comparison, not
  assignment.
<div class="Pp"></div>
VERSION 3.1
<div class="Pp"></div>
Added type argument to WORLD and LOGIN hooks.
<div class="Pp"></div>
VERSION 3.0
<div class="Pp"></div>
Backslashes in macros are interpreted slightly differently than in previous
  versions. Turning on the &quot;backslash&quot; flag will enable the old
  behavior.
<div class="Pp"></div>
VERSION 2.1
<div class="Pp"></div>
The CONNECT hook is now called before the LOGIN hook. In 2.0, CONNECT was called
  after autologin.
<div class="Pp"></div>
VERSION 2.0
<div class="Pp"></div>
In versions prior to 2.0, &lt;space&gt; was used to scroll the pager; 2.0 uses
  &lt;tab&gt; as the default, to allow the pager to be nonblocking.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Tinytalk</i> style name gags and hilites are no longer supported. You must
  use the '*' wildcard explicitly, as in '/hilite hawkeye*'.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Tinytalk</i> style page and whisper hilites are no longer supported. However,
  /hilite_page and /hilite_whisper macros are provided in the default macro
  library.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The .tinytalk file may not be supported in the future; use .tfrc instead.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The '-' command line option in versions prior to 2.0 is no longer supported, and
  has been replaced with '-l'.

When unterbamfing, the old connection should not be closed until the new
  connection succeeds.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If a shell quote (/quote !) reads a partial line from the pipe, the read will
  block until the rest of the line is read.
