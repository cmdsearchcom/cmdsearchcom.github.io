<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
t.rast.algebra performs temporal and spatial map algebra
operations on space time raster datasets (STRDS) by using
the temporal raster algebra.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROGRAM USE <br>
The module expects an expression as input parameter in the
following form:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;result =
expression&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The statement structure is
similar to r.mapcalc, see r.mapcalc. Where result represents
the name of a space time raster dataset (STRDS)that will
contain the result of the calcu&acirc; <br>
lation that is given as expression on the right side of the
equality sign. These expression can be any valid or nested
combination of temporal operations and spatial overlay or
<br>
buffer functions that are provided by the temporal algebra.
<br>
The temporal raster algebra works with space time raster
datasets only (STRDS). The algebra provides methods for map
selection from STRDS based on their temporal relations. It
<br>
is also possible to temporally shift maps, to create
temporal buffer and to snap time instances to create a valid
temporal topology. Furthermore expressions can be nested and
<br>
evaluated in conditional statements (if, else statements).
Within if-statements the algebra provides temporal variables
like start time, end time, day of year, time differences
<br>
or number of maps per time interval to build up conditions.
<br>
In addition the algebra provides a subset of the spatial
operations from r.mapcalc. All these operations can be
assigned to STRDS or to the resulting map lists of
operations <br>
between STRDS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As default, topological
relationships between space time datasets will be evaluated
only temporal. Use the s flag to activate the additionally
evaluate the spatial topology based <br>
on the spatial extents of maps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The expression option must be
passed as quoted expression, for example: <br>
t.rast.mapcalc2 expression=&quot;C = A + B&quot;
basename=result <br>
Where C is the new space time raster dataset that will
contain maps with the basename &quot;result&quot; that
represent the sum of maps from STRDS A and equally temporal
related maps from <br>
STRDS B.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The map basename for the result
STRDS must always be specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TEMPORAL RASTER ALGEBRA <br>
The temporal algebra provides a wide range of temporal
operators and functions that will be presented in the
following section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TEMPORAL RELATIONS <br>
Several temporal topology relations between registered maps
of space time datasets are supported: <br>
equals A ------ <br>
B ------ <br>
during A ---- <br>
B ------ <br>
contains A ------ <br>
B ---- <br>
starts A ---- <br>
B ------ <br>
started A ------ <br>
B ---- <br>
finishs A ---- <br>
B ------ <br>
finished A ------ <br>
B ---- <br>
precedes A ---- <br>
B ---- <br>
follows A ---- <br>
B ---- <br>
overlapped A ------ <br>
B ------ <br>
overlaps A ------ <br>
B ------ <br>
over booth overlaps and overlapped <br>
The relations must be read as: A is related to B, like - A
equals B - A is during B - A contains B</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Topological relations must be
specified in {} parentheses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TEMPORAL OPERATORS <br>
The temporal algebra defines temporal operators that can be
combined with other operators to perform spatio-temporal
operations. The temporal operators process the time <br>
instances and intervals of two temporal related maps and
calculate the result temporal extent by five different
possibilities. <br>
LEFT REFERENCE l Use the time stamp of the left space time
dataset <br>
INTERSECTION i Intersection <br>
DISJOINT UNION d Disjoint union <br>
UNION u Union <br>
RIGHT REFERENCE r Use the time stamp of the right space time
dataset</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TEMPORAL SELECTION <br>
The temporal selection simply selects parts of a space time
dataset without processing raster or vector data. The
algebra provides a selection operator : that selects parts
of a <br>
space time dataset that are temporally equal to parts of a
second one by default. The following expression <br>
C = A : B <br>
means: Select all parts of space time dataset A that are
equal to B and store it in space time dataset C. The parts
are time stamped maps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition the inverse
selection operator !: is defined as the complement of the
selection operator, hence the following expression <br>
C = A !: B <br>
means: select all parts of space time time dataset A that
are not equal to B and store it in space time dataset (STDS)
C.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To select parts of a STDS by
different topological relations to other STDS, the temporal
topology selection operator can be used. The operator
consists of the temporal selection <br>
operator, the topological relations, that must be separated
by the logical OR operator | and the temporal extent
operator. All three parts are separated by comma and
surrounded <br>
by curly braces: {&quot;temporal selection operator&quot;,
&quot;topological relations&quot;, &quot;temporal
operator&quot;}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples: <br>
C = A {:, equals} B <br>
C = A {!:, equals} B <br>
We can now define arbitrary topological relations using the
OR operator &quot;|&quot; to connect them: <br>
C = A {:,equals|during|overlaps} B <br>
Select all parts of A that are equal to B, during B or
overlaps B. <br>
In addition we can define the temporal extent of the result
STDS by adding the temporal operator. <br>
C = A {:, during,r} B <br>
Select all parts of A that are during B and use the temporal
extents from B for C. <br>
The selection operator is implicitly contained in the
temporal topology selection operator, so that the following
statements are exactly the same: <br>
C = A : B <br>
C = A {:} B <br>
C = A {:,equal} B <br>
C = A {:,equal,l} B <br>
Same for the complementary selection: <br>
C = A !: B <br>
C = A {!:} B <br>
C = A {!:,equal} B <br>
C = A {!:,equal,l} B</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS <br>
Selection operations can be evaluated within conditional
statements. <br>
Note A and B can either be space time datasets or
expressions. The temporal <br>
relationship between the conditions and the conclusions can
be defined at the <br>
beginning of the if statement. The relationship between then
and else conclusion <br>
must be always equal. <br>
if statement decision option temporal relations <br>
if(if, then, else) <br>
if(conditions, A) A if conditions are True; temporal
topological relation between if and then is equal. <br>
if(conditions, A, B) A if conditions are True, B otherwise;
temporal topological relation between if, then and else is
equal. <br>
if(topologies, conditions, A) A if conditions are True;
temporal topological relation between if and then is
explicit specified by topologies. <br>
if(topologies, conditions, A, B) A if conditions are True, B
otherwise; temporal topological relation between if, then
and else is explicit specified by topologies. <br>
The conditions are comparison expressions that are used to
evaluate space time datasets. Specific values of temporal
variables are compared by logical operators and evaluated
for <br>
each map of the STDS. <br>
Important: The conditions are evaluated from left to
right.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Logical operators <br>

end_minute(A) The minute of the end time [0 - 59] <br>
end_second(A) The second of the end time [0 - 59]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Comparison operator <br>
The conditions are comparison expressions that are used to
evaluate space time datasets. Specific values of temporal
variables are compared by logical operators and evaluated
for <br>
each map of the STDS and the related maps. For complex
relations the comparison operator can be used to combine
conditions: <br>
The structure is similar to the select operator with the
extension of an aggregation operator: {&quot;comparison
operator&quot;, &quot;topological relations&quot;,
aggregation operator, &quot;temporal <br>
operator&quot;} <br>
This aggregation operator (| or &amp;) define the behaviour
if a map is related the more than one map, e.g for the
topological relations &acirc;contains&acirc;. Should all
(&amp;) conditions for <br>
the related maps be true or is it sufficient to have any (|)
condition that is true. The resulting boolean value is then
compared to the first condition by the comparison
opera&acirc; <br>
tor (|| or &amp;&amp;). As default the aggregation operator
is related to the comparison operator: <br>
Comparison operator -&gt; aggregation operator: <br>
|| -&gt; | and &amp;&amp; -&gt; &amp; <br>
Examples: <br>
Condition 1 {||, equal, r} Condition 2 <br>
Condition 1 {&amp;&amp;, equal|during, l} Condition 2 <br>
Condition 1 {&amp;&amp;, equal|contains, |, l} Condition 2
<br>
Condition 1 {&amp;&amp;, equal|during, l} Condition 2
&amp;&amp; Condition 3 <br>
Condition 1 {&amp;&amp;, equal|during, l} Condition 2
{&amp;&amp;,contains, |, r} Condition 3</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hash operator <br>
Additionally the number of maps in intervals can be computed
and used in conditional statements with the hash (#)
operator. <br>
A{#, contains}B <br>
This expression computes the number of maps from space time
dataset B which are during the time intervals of maps from
space time dataset A. <br>
A list of integers (scalars) corresponding to the maps of A
that contain maps from B will be returned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C = if({equal}, A {#, contains}
B &gt; 2, A {:, contains} B) <br>
This expression selects all maps from A that temporally
contains at least 2 maps from B and stores them in space
time dataset C. The leading equal statement in the if
condition <br>
specifies the temporal relation between the if and then part
of the if expression. This is very important, so we do not
need to specify a global time reference (a space time <br>
dataset) for temporal processing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Furthermore the temporal algebra
allows temporal buffering, shifting and snapping with the
functions buff_t(), tshift() and tsnap() respectively. <br>
buff_t(A, size) Buffer STDS A with granule (&quot;1
month&quot; or 5) <br>
tshift(A, size) Shift STDS A with granule (&quot;1
month&quot; or 5) <br>
tsnap(A) Snap time instances and intervals of STDS A</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Single map with temporal extent
<br>
The temporal algebra can also handle single maps with time
stamps in the tmap function. <br>
tmap() <br>
For example: <br>
C = A {:,during} tmap(event) <br>
This statement select all maps from space time data set A
that are during the temporal extent of single map
&acirc;event&acirc;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Spatial raster operators <br>
The module supports the following raster operations: <br>
Symbol description precedence <br>
% modulus 1 <br>
/ division 1 <br>
* multiplication 1 <br>
+ addition 2 <br>
- subtraction 2 <br>
And raster functions: <br>
abs(x) return absolute value of x <br>
float(x) convert x to foating point <br>
int(x) convert x to integer [ truncates ] <br>
log(x) natural log of x <br>
sqrt(x) square root of x <br>
tan(x) tangent of x (x is in degrees) <br>
round(x) round x to nearest integer <br>
sin(x) sine of x (x is in degrees) <br>
isnull(x) check if x = NULL <br>
isntnull(x) check if x is not NULL <br>
null set null value <br>
exist(x) Check if x is in the current mapset</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Single raster map <br>
The temporal raster algebra feature also a function to
integrate single raster maps without time stamps into the
expressions. <br>
map() <br>
For example: <br>
C = A * map(constant_value) <br>
This statement multiply all raster maps from space time
raster data set A with the raster map
&acirc;constant_value&acirc;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Combinations of temporal, raster
and select operators <br>
We combine the temporal topology relations, the temporal
operators and the spatial/select operators to create
spatio-temporal operators: <br>
{&quot;spatial or select operator&quot;, &quot;list of
temporal relations&quot;, &quot;temporal operator&quot;}
<br>
For multiple topological relations or several related maps
the spatio-temporal operators feature implicit aggregation.
The algebra evaluates the stated STDS by their temporal <br>
topologies and apply the given spatio temporal operators in
a aggregated form. If we have two STDS A and B, B has three
maps: b1, b2, b3 that are all during the temporal extent
<br>
of the single map a1 of A, then the following arithmetic
calculations would implicitly aggregate all maps of B into
one result map for a1 of A: <br>
C = A {+, contains} B --&gt; c1 = a1 + b1 + b2 + b3</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Keep attention that the
aggregation behaviour is not symmetric: <br>
C = B {+, during} A --&gt; c1 = b1 + a1 <br>
c2 = b2 + a1 <br>
c3 = b3 + a1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Temporal neighbourhood modifier
<br>
The neighbourhood modifier of r.mapcalc is extended for the
temporal raster algebra by the temporal dimension. The
format is strds[t,r,c], where t is the temporal offset, r is
<br>
the row offset and c is the column offset. <br>
strds[2] <br>
Refers to the second successor of the current map <br>
strds[1,2] <br>
Refers to the cell one row below and two columns to the
right of the current cell in the current map <br>
strds[1,-2,-1] <br>
Refers to the cell two rows above and one column to the left
of the current cell of the first successor map <br>
strds[-2,0,1] <br>
Refers to the cell one column to the right of the current
cell in the second predecessor map.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples: <br>
Sum maps from space time dataset A with maps from space time
dataset B which have equal time stamps and are temporary
before Jan. 1. 2005 and store them in space time dataset D.
<br>
D = if(start_date(A) &lt; &quot;2005-01-01&quot;, A + B)
<br>
Create the sum of all maps from STRDS A and B that have
equal time stamps and store the new maps in STRDS C: <br>
C = A + B <br>
Same expression with explicit definition of the temporal
topology relation and temporal operators: <br>
C = A {+,equal,l} B <br>
Select all cells from STRDS B with equal temporal relations
to STRDS A, if the cells of A are in the range of [100.0,
1600] of time intervals that have more then 30 days (Jan,
<br>
Mar, Mai, Jul, Aug, Oct, Dec): <br>
C = if(A &gt; 100 &amp;&amp; A &lt; 1600 &amp;&amp; td(A)
&gt; 30, B) <br>
Same expression with explicit definition of the temporal
topology relation and temporal operators: <br>
C = if({equal}, A &gt; 100 &amp;&amp; A &lt; 1600
{&amp;&amp;,equal} td(A) &gt; 30, B) <br>
Compute the recharge in meter per second for all cells of
precipitation STRDS &quot;Prec&quot; if the mean temperature
specified in STRDS &quot;Temp&quot; is higher than 10
degrees. Computation is <br>
performed if STRDS &quot;Prec&quot; and &quot;Temp&quot;
have equal time stamps. The number of days or fraction of
days per interval is computed using the td() function that
has as argument the <br>
STRDS &quot;Prec&quot;: <br>
C = if(Temp &gt; 10.0, Prec / 3600.0 /24.0 / td(Prec)) <br>
Same expression with explicit definition of the temporal
topology relation and temporal operators: <br>
C = if({equal}, Temp &gt; 10.0, Prec / 3600.0 / 24.0
{/,equal,l} td(Prec)) <br>
Compute the mean value of all maps from STRDS A that are
located during time intervals of STRDS B if more than one
map of A is contained in an interval of B, use A otherwise,
the <br>
resulting time intervals are either from B or A: <br>
C = if(B {#,contain} A &gt; 1, (B {+,contain,l} A - B) / (B
{#,contain} A), A) <br>
Same expression with explicit definition of the temporal
topology relation and temporal operators: <br>
C = if({equal}, B {#,contain} A &gt; 1, (B {+,contain,l} A
{-,equal,l} B) {equal,=/} (B {#,contain} A), A)</p>
