<p>GIT-DIFF-FILES(1) Git Manual GIT-DIFF-FILES(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
git-diff-files - Compares files in the working tree and the
index</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
git diff-files [-q] [-0|-1|-2|-3|-c|--cc] [&lt;common diff
options&gt;] [&lt;path&gt;...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Compares the files in the working tree and the index. When
paths are specified, compares only those named paths.
Otherwise all entries in the index are compared. The output
<br>
format is the same as for git diff-index and git
diff-tree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-p, -u, --patch <br>
Generate patch (see section on generating patches).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U&lt;n&gt;, --unified=&lt;n&gt;
<br>
Generate diffs with &lt;n&gt; lines of context instead of
the usual three. Implies -p.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--raw <br>
Generate the raw format. This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--patch-with-raw <br>
Synonym for -p --raw.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--minimal <br>
Spend extra time to make sure the smallest possible diff is
produced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--patience <br>
Generate a diff using the &quot;patience diff&quot;
algorithm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--histogram <br>
Generate a diff using the &quot;histogram diff&quot;
algorithm.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--diff-algorithm={patience|minimal|histogram|myers}
<br>
Choose a diff algorithm. The variants are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">default, myers <br>
The basic greedy diff algorithm. Currently, this is the
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">minimal <br>
Spend extra time to make sure the smallest possible diff is
produced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">patience <br>
Use &quot;patience diff&quot; algorithm when generating
patches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">histogram <br>
This algorithm extends the patience algorithm to
&quot;support low-occurrence common elements&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For instance, if you configured
diff.algorithm variable to a non-default value and want to
use the default one, then you have to use
--diff-algorithm=default option.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--stat[=&lt;width&gt;[,&lt;name-width&gt;[,&lt;count&gt;]]]
<br>
Generate a diffstat. By default, as much space as necessary
will be used for the filename part, and the rest for the
graph part. Maximum width defaults to terminal width, or
<br>
80 columns if not connected to a terminal, and can be
overridden by &lt;width&gt;. The width of the filename part
can be limited by giving another width &lt;name-width&gt;
after a comma. <br>
The width of the graph part can be limited by using
--stat-graph-width=&lt;width&gt; (affects all commands
generating a stat graph) or by setting
diff.statGraphWidth=&lt;width&gt; (does <br>
not affect git format-patch). By giving a third parameter
&lt;count&gt;, you can limit the output to the first
&lt;count&gt; lines, followed by ... if there are more.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These parameters can also be set
individually with --stat-width=&lt;width&gt;,
--stat-name-width=&lt;name-width&gt; and
--stat-count=&lt;count&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--numstat <br>
Similar to --stat, but shows number of added and deleted
lines in decimal notation and pathname without abbreviation,
to make it more machine friendly. For binary files, <br>
outputs two - instead of saying 0 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--shortstat <br>
Output only the last line of the --stat format containing
total number of modified files, as well as number of added
and deleted lines.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dirstat[=&lt;param1,param2,...&gt;]
<br>
Output the distribution of relative amount of changes for
each sub-directory. The behavior of --dirstat can be
customized by passing it a comma separated list of
parameters. <br>
The defaults are controlled by the diff.dirstat
configuration variable (see git-config(1)). The following
parameters are available:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">changes <br>
Compute the dirstat numbers by counting the lines that have
been removed from the source, or added to the destination.
This ignores the amount of pure code movements <br>
within a file. In other words, rearranging lines in a file
is not counted as much as other changes. This is the default
behavior when no parameter is given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lines <br>
Compute the dirstat numbers by doing the regular line-based
diff analysis, and summing the removed/added line counts.
(For binary files, count 64-byte chunks instead, <br>
since binary files have no natural concept of lines). This
is a more expensive --dirstat behavior than the changes
behavior, but it does count rearranged lines within a <br>
file as much as other changes. The resulting output is
consistent with what you get from the other --*stat
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">files <br>
Compute the dirstat numbers by counting the number of files
changed. Each changed file counts equally in the dirstat
analysis. This is the computationally cheapest <br>
--dirstat behavior, since it does not have to look at the
file contents at all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cumulative <br>
Count changes in a child directory for the parent directory
as well. Note that when using cumulative, the sum of the
percentages reported may exceed 100%. The default <br>
(non-cumulative) behavior can be specified with the
noncumulative parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;limit&gt; <br>
An integer parameter specifies a cut-off percent (3% by
default). Directories contributing less than this percentage
of the changes are not shown in the output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example: The following will
count changed files, while ignoring directories with less
than 10% of the total amount of changed files, and
accumulating child directory counts <br>
in the parent directories:
--dirstat=files,10,cumulative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--summary <br>
Output a condensed summary of extended header information
such as creations, renames and mode changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--patch-with-stat <br>
Synonym for -p --stat.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z <br>
When --raw, --numstat, --name-only or --name-status has been
given, do not munge pathnames and use NULs as output field
terminators.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Without this option, each
pathname output will have TAB, LF, double quotes, and
backslash characters replaced with , 0 <br>
enclosed in double quotes if any of those replacements
occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--name-only <br>
Show only names of changed files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--name-status <br>
Show only names and status of changed files. See the
description of the --diff-filter option on what the status
letters mean.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--submodule[=&lt;format&gt;]
<br>
Specify how differences in submodules are shown. When
--submodule or --submodule=log is given, the log format is
used. This format lists the commits in the range like git-
<br>
submodule(1)summary does. Omitting the --submodule option or
specifying --submodule=short, uses the short format. This
format just shows the names of the commits at the <br>
beginning and end of the range. Can be tweaked via the
diff.submodule configuration variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--color[=&lt;when&gt;] <br>
Show colored diff. --color (i.e. without =&lt;when&gt;) is
the same as --color=always. &lt;when&gt; can be one of
always, never, or auto.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-color <br>
Turn off colored diff. It is the same as --color=never.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--word-diff[=&lt;mode&gt;] <br>
Show a word diff, using the &lt;mode&gt; to delimit changed
words. By default, words are delimited by whitespace; see
--word-diff-regex below. The &lt;mode&gt; defaults to plain,
and <br>
must be one of:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">color <br>
Highlight changed words using only colors. Implies
--color.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">plain <br>
Show words as [-removed-] and {+added+}. Makes no attempts
to escape the delimiters if they appear in the input, so the
output may be ambiguous.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">porcelain <br>
Use a special line-based format intended for script
consumption. Added/removed/unchanged runs are printed in the
usual unified diff format, starting with a +/-/&lsquo;
&lsquo; <br>
character at the beginning of the line and extending to the
end of the line. Newlines in the input are represented by a
tilde ~ on a line of its own.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">none <br>
Disable word diff again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that despite the name of
the first mode, color is used to highlight the changed parts
in all modes if enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--word-diff-regex=&lt;regex&gt;
<br>
Use &lt;regex&gt; to decide what a word is, instead of
considering runs of non-whitespace to be a word. Also
implies --word-diff unless it was already enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Every non-overlapping match of
the &lt;regex&gt; is considered a word. Anything between
these matches is considered whitespace and ignored(!) for
the purposes of finding <br>
differences. You may want to append |[^[:space:]] to your
regular expression to make sure that it matches all
non-whitespace characters. A match that contains a newline
is <br>
silently truncated(!) at the newline.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The regex can also be set via a
diff driver or configuration option, see gitattributes(1) or
git-config(1). Giving it explicitly overrides any diff
driver or configuration <br>
setting. Diff drivers override configuration settings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--color-words[=&lt;regex&gt;]
<br>
Equivalent to --word-diff=color plus (if a regex was
specified) --word-diff-regex=&lt;regex&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-renames <br>
Turn off rename detection, even when the configuration file
gives the default to do so.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--check <br>
Warn if changes introduce whitespace errors. What are
considered whitespace errors is controlled by
core.whitespace configuration. By default, trailing
whitespaces (including <br>
lines that solely consist of whitespaces) and a space
character that is immediately followed by a tab character
inside the initial indent of the line are considered <br>
whitespace errors. Exits with non-zero status if problems
are found. Not compatible with --exit-code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--full-index <br>
Instead of the first handful of characters, show the full
pre- and post-image blob object names on the
&quot;index&quot; line when generating patch format
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--binary <br>
In addition to --full-index, output a binary diff that can
be applied with git-apply.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--abbrev[=&lt;n&gt;] <br>
Instead of showing the full 40-byte hexadecimal object name
in diff-raw format output and diff-tree header lines, show
only a partial prefix. This is independent of the <br>
--full-index option above, which controls the diff-patch
output format. Non default number of digits can be specified
with --abbrev=&lt;n&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B[&lt;n&gt;][/&lt;m&gt;],
--break-rewrites[=[&lt;n&gt;][/&lt;m&gt;]] <br>
Break complete rewrite changes into pairs of delete and
create. This serves two purposes:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It affects the way a change that
amounts to a total rewrite of a file not as a series of
deletion and insertion mixed together with a very few lines
that happen to match <br>
textually as the context, but as a single deletion of
everything old followed by a single insertion of everything
new, and the number m controls this aspect of the -B option
<br>
(defaults to 60%). -B/70% specifies that less than 30% of
the original should remain in the result for Git to consider
it a total rewrite (i.e. otherwise the resulting patch <br>
will be a series of deletion and insertion mixed together
with context lines).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When used with -M, a
totally-rewritten file is also considered as the source of a
rename (usually -M only considers a file that disappeared as
the source of a rename), and <br>
the number n controls this aspect of the -B option (defaults
to 50%). -B20% specifies that a change with addition and
deletion compared to 20% or more of the file&acirc;s size
are <br>
eligible for being picked up as a possible source of a
rename to another file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M[&lt;n&gt;],
--find-renames[=&lt;n&gt;] <br>
Detect renames. If n is specified, it is a threshold on the
similarity index (i.e. amount of addition/deletions compared
to the file&acirc;s size). For example, -M90% means Git <br>
should consider a delete/add pair to be a rename if more
than 90% of the file hasn&acirc;t changed. Without a % sign,
the number is to be read as a fraction, with a decimal point
<br>
before it. I.e., -M5 becomes 0.5, and is thus the same as
-M50%. Similarly, -M05 is the same as -M5%. To limit
detection to exact renames, use -M100%.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C[&lt;n&gt;],
--find-copies[=&lt;n&gt;] <br>
Detect copies as well as renames. See also
--find-copies-harder. If n is specified, it has the same
meaning as for -M&lt;n&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--find-copies-harder <br>
For performance reasons, by default, -C option finds copies
only if the original file of the copy was modified in the
same changeset. This flag makes the command inspect <br>
unmodified files as candidates for the source of copy. This
is a very expensive operation for large projects, so use it
with caution. Giving more than one -C option has the <br>
same effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D, --irreversible-delete <br>
Omit the preimage for deletes, i.e. print only the header
but not the diff between the preimage and /dev/null. The
resulting patch is not meant to be applied with patch nor
<br>
git apply; this is solely for people who want to just
concentrate on reviewing the text after the change. In
addition, the output obviously lack enough information to
apply <br>
such a patch in reverse, even manually, hence the name of
the option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When used together with -B, omit
also the preimage in the deletion part of a delete/create
pair.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l&lt;num&gt; <br>
The -M and -C options require O(n^2) processing time where n
is the number of potential rename/copy targets. This option
prevents rename/copy detection from running if the <br>
number of rename/copy targets exceeds the specified
number.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--diff-filter=[(A|C|D|M|R|T|U|X|B)...[*]]
<br>
Select only files that are Added (A), Copied (C), Deleted
(D), Modified (M), Renamed (R), have their type (i.e.
regular file, symlink, submodule, ...) changed (T), are <br>
Unmerged (U), are Unknown (X), or have had their pairing
Broken (B). Any combination of the filter characters
(including none) can be used. When * (All-or-none) is added
to <br>
the combination, all paths are selected if there is any file
that matches other criteria in the comparison; if there is
no file that matches other criteria, nothing is <br>
selected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S&lt;string&gt; <br>
Look for differences that introduce or remove an instance of
&lt;string&gt;. Note that this is different than the string
simply appearing in diff output; see the pickaxe entry in
<br>
gitdiffcore(7) for more details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-G&lt;regex&gt; <br>
Look for differences whose added or removed line matches the
given &lt;regex&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--pickaxe-all <br>
When -S or -G finds a change, show all the changes in that
changeset, not just the files that contain the change in
&lt;string&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--pickaxe-regex <br>
Make the &lt;string&gt; not a plain string but an extended
POSIX regex to match.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O&lt;orderfile&gt; <br>
Output the patch in the order specified in the
&lt;orderfile&gt;, which has one shell glob pattern per
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R <br>
Swap two inputs; that is, show differences from index or
on-disk file to tree contents.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--relative[=&lt;path&gt;] <br>
When run from a subdirectory of the project, it can be told
to exclude changes outside the directory and show pathnames
relative to it with this option. When you are not in a <br>
subdirectory (e.g. in a bare repository), you can name which
subdirectory to make the output relative to by giving a
&lt;path&gt; as an argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a, --text <br>
Treat all files as text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ignore-space-at-eol <br>
Ignore changes in whitespace at EOL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b, --ignore-space-change <br>
Ignore changes in amount of whitespace. This ignores
whitespace at line end, and considers all other sequences of
one or more whitespace characters to be equivalent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w, --ignore-all-space <br>
Ignore whitespace when comparing lines. This ignores
differences even if one line has whitespace where the other
line has none.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--inter-hunk-context=&lt;lines&gt;
<br>
Show the context between diff hunks, up to the specified
number of lines, thereby fusing hunks that are close to each
other.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-W, --function-context <br>
Show whole surrounding functions of changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--exit-code <br>
Make the program exit with codes similar to diff(1). That
is, it exits with 1 if there were differences and 0 means no
differences.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--quiet <br>
Disable all output of the program. Implies --exit-code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ext-diff <br>
Allow an external diff helper to be executed. If you set an
external diff driver with gitattributes(5), you need to use
this option with git-log(1) and friends.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-ext-diff <br>
Disallow external diff drivers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--textconv, --no-textconv <br>
Allow (or disallow) external text conversion filters to be
run when comparing binary files. See gitattributes(5) for
details. Because textconv filters are typically a one-way
<br>
conversion, the resulting diff is suitable for human
consumption, but cannot be applied. For this reason,
textconv filters are enabled by default only for git-diff(1)
and <br>
git-log(1), but not for git-format-patch(1) or diff plumbing
commands.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ignore-submodules[=&lt;when&gt;]
<br>
Ignore changes to submodules in the diff generation.
&lt;when&gt; can be either &quot;none&quot;,
&quot;untracked&quot;, &quot;dirty&quot; or &quot;all&quot;,
which is the default. Using &quot;none&quot; will consider
the <br>
submodule modified when it either contains untracked or
modified files or its HEAD differs from the commit recorded
in the superproject and can be used to override any <br>
settings of the ignore option in git-config(1) or
gitmodules(5). When &quot;untracked&quot; is used submodules
are not considered dirty when they only contain untracked
content (but <br>
they are still scanned for modified content). Using
&quot;dirty&quot; ignores all changes to the work tree of
submodules, only changes to the commits stored in the
superproject are <br>
shown (this was the behavior until 1.7.0). Using
&quot;all&quot; hides all changes to submodules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--src-prefix=&lt;prefix&gt; <br>
Show the given source prefix instead of &quot;a/&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dst-prefix=&lt;prefix&gt; <br>
Show the given destination prefix instead of
&quot;b/&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-prefix <br>
Do not show any source or destination prefix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For more detailed explanation on
these common options, see also gitdiffcore(7).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-1 --base, -2 --ours, -3
--theirs, -0 <br>
Diff against the &quot;base&quot; version, &quot;our
branch&quot; or &quot;their branch&quot; respectively. With
these options, diffs for merged entries are not shown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is to diff against
our branch (-2) and the cleanly resolved paths. The option
-0 can be given to omit diff output for unmerged entries and
just show &quot;Unmerged&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --cc <br>
This compares stage 2 (our branch), stage 3 (their branch)
and the working tree file and outputs a combined diff,
similar to the way diff-tree shows a merge commit with these
<br>
flags.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q <br>
Remain silent even on nonexistent files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RAW OUTPUT FORMAT <br>
The raw output format from &quot;git-diff-index&quot;,
&quot;git-diff-tree&quot;, &quot;git-diff-files&quot; and
&quot;git diff --raw&quot; are very similar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These commands all compare two
sets of things; what is compared differs:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">git-diff-index &lt;tree-ish&gt;
<br>
compares the &lt;tree-ish&gt; and the files on the
filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">git-diff-index --cached
&lt;tree-ish&gt; <br>
compares the &lt;tree-ish&gt; and the index.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">git-diff-tree [-r]
&lt;tree-ish-1&gt; &lt;tree-ish-2&gt; [&lt;pattern&gt;...]
<br>
compares the trees named by the two arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">git-diff-files
[&lt;pattern&gt;...] <br>
compares the index and the files on the filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;git-diff-tree&quot;
command begins its output by printing the hash of what is
being compared. After that, all the commands print one
output line per changed file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An output line is formatted this
way:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">in-place edit :100644 100644
bcd1234... 0123456... M file0 <br>
copy-edit :100644 100644 abcd123... 1234567... C68 file1
file2 <br>
rename-edit :100644 100644 abcd123... 1234567... R86 file1
file3 <br>
create :000000 100644 0000000... 1234567... A file4 <br>
delete :100644 000000 1234567... 0000000... D file5 <br>
unmerged :000000 000000 0000000... 0000000... U file6</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">That is, from the left to the
right:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. a colon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. mode for &quot;src&quot;;
000000 if creation or unmerged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. a space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. mode for &quot;dst&quot;;
000000 if deletion or unmerged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5. a space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6. sha1 for &quot;src&quot;;
0{40} if creation or unmerged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">7. a space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">8. sha1 for &quot;dst&quot;;
0{40} if creation, unmerged or &quot;look at work
tree&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">9. a space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">10. status, followed by optional
&quot;score&quot; number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">11. a tab or a NUL when -z
option is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">12. path for &quot;src&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">13. a tab or a NUL when -z
option is used; only exists for C or R.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">14. path for &quot;dst&quot;;
only exists for C or R.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">15. an LF or a NUL when -z
option is used, to terminate the record.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Possible status letters are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A: addition of a
file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; C: copy of a
file into a new one</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; D: deletion of a
file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; M: modification
of the contents or mode of a file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; R: renaming of a
file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; T: change in the
type of the file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; U: file is
unmerged (you must complete the merge before it can be
committed)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; X:
&quot;unknown&quot; change type (most probably a bug, please
report it)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Status letters C and R are
always followed by a score (denoting the percentage of
similarity between the source and target of the move or
copy), and are the only ones to be so.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;sha1&gt; is shown as all
0&acirc;s if a file is new on the filesystem and it is out
of sync with the index.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">:100644 100644 5be4a4......
000000...... M file.c</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When -z option is not used, TAB,
LF, and backslash characters in pathnames are represented as
, 0 and \, respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIFF FORMAT FOR MERGES <br>
&quot;git-diff-tree&quot;, &quot;git-diff-files&quot; and
&quot;git-diff --raw&quot; can take -c or --cc option to
generate diff output also for merge commits. The output
differs from the format described <br>
above in the following way:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. there is a colon for each
parent</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. there are more
&quot;src&quot; modes and &quot;src&quot; sha1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. status is concatenated status
characters for each parent</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. no optional &quot;score&quot;
number</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5. single path, only for
&quot;dst&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">::100644 100644 100644
fabadb8... cc95eb0... 4866510... MM describe.c</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that combined diff lists
only files which were modified from all parents.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GENERATING PATCHES WITH -P <br>
When &quot;git-diff-index&quot;, &quot;git-diff-tree&quot;,
or &quot;git-diff-files&quot; are run with a -p option,
&quot;git diff&quot; without the --raw option, or &quot;git
log&quot; with the &quot;-p&quot; option, they do not
produce <br>
the output described above; instead they produce a patch
file. You can customize the creation of such patches via the
GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF and the GIT_DIFF_OPTS environment <br>
variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">What the -p option produces is
slightly different from the traditional diff format:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. It is preceded with a
&quot;git diff&quot; header that looks like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">diff --git a/file1 b/file2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The a/ and b/ filenames are the
same unless rename/copy is involved. Especially, even for a
creation or a deletion, /dev/null is not used in place of
the a/ or b/ filenames.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When rename/copy is involved,
file1 and file2 show the name of the source file of the
rename/copy and the name of the file that rename/copy
produces, respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. It is followed by one or more
extended header lines:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">old mode &lt;mode&gt; <br>
new mode &lt;mode&gt; <br>
deleted file mode &lt;mode&gt; <br>
new file mode &lt;mode&gt; <br>
copy from &lt;path&gt; <br>
copy to &lt;path&gt; <br>
rename from &lt;path&gt; <br>
rename to &lt;path&gt; <br>
similarity index &lt;number&gt; <br>
dissimilarity index &lt;number&gt; <br>
index &lt;hash&gt;..&lt;hash&gt; &lt;mode&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File modes are printed as
6-digit octal numbers including the file type and file
permission bits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Path names in extended headers
do not include the a/ and b/ prefixes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The similarity index is the
percentage of unchanged lines, and the dissimilarity index
is the percentage of changed lines. It is a rounded down
integer, followed by a percent <br>
sign. The similarity index value of 100% is thus reserved
for two equal files, while 100% dissimilarity means that no
line from the old file made it into the new one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The index line includes the
SHA-1 checksum before and after the change. The &lt;mode&gt;
is included if the file mode does not change; otherwise,
separate lines indicate the old <br>
and the new mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. TAB, LF, double quote and
backslash characters in pathnames are represented as , 0
<br>
is put in double quotes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. All the file1 files in the
output refer to files before the commit, and all the file2
files refer to files after the commit. It is incorrect to
apply each change to each file <br>
sequentially. For example, this patch will swap a and b:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">diff --git a/a b/b <br>
rename from a <br>
rename to b <br>
diff --git a/b b/a <br>
rename from b <br>
rename to a</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMBINED DIFF FORMAT <br>
Any diff-generating command can take the &acirc;-c&lsquo; or
--cc option to produce a combined diff when showing a merge.
This is the default format when showing merges with
git-diff(1) or <br>
git-show(1). Note also that you can give the
&lsquo;-m&acirc; option to any of these commands to force
generation of diffs with individual parents of a merge.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A combined diff format looks
like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">diff --combined describe.c <br>
index fabadb8,cc95eb0..4866510 <br>
--- a/describe.c <br>
+++ b/describe.c <br>
@@@ -98,20 -98,12 +98,20 @@@ <br>
return (a_date &gt; b_date) ? -1 : (a_date == b_date) ? 0 :
1; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- static void describe(char
*arg) <br>
-static void describe(struct commit *cmit, int last_one)
<br>
++static void describe(char *arg, int last_one) <br>
{ <br>
+ unsigned char sha1[20]; <br>
+ struct commit *cmit; <br>
struct commit_list *list; <br>
static int initialized = 0; <br>
struct commit_name *n;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+ if (get_sha1(arg, sha1) &lt;
0) <br>
+ usage(describe_usage); <br>
+ cmit = lookup_commit_reference(sha1); <br>
+ if (!cmit) <br>
+ usage(describe_usage); <br>
+ <br>
if (!initialized) { <br>
initialized = 1; <br>
for_each_ref(get_name);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. It is preceded with a
&quot;git diff&quot; header, that looks like this (when -c
option is used):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">diff --combined file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or like this (when --cc option
is used):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">diff --cc file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. It is followed by one or more
extended header lines (this example shows a merge with two
parents):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">index
&lt;hash&gt;,&lt;hash&gt;..&lt;hash&gt; <br>
mode &lt;mode&gt;,&lt;mode&gt;..&lt;mode&gt; <br>
new file mode &lt;mode&gt; <br>
deleted file mode &lt;mode&gt;,&lt;mode&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The mode
&lt;mode&gt;,&lt;mode&gt;..&lt;mode&gt; line appears only if
at least one of the &lt;mode&gt; is different from the rest.
Extended headers with information about detected contents
movement <br>
(renames and copying detection) are designed to work with
diff of two &lt;tree-ish&gt; and are not used by combined
diff format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. It is followed by two-line
from-file/to-file header</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--- a/file <br>
+++ b/file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Similar to two-line header for
traditional unified diff format, /dev/null is used to signal
created or deleted files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. Chunk header format is
modified to prevent people from accidentally feeding it to
patch -p1. Combined diff format was created for review of
merge commit changes, and was not <br>
meant for apply. The change is similar to the change in the
extended index header:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@@@ &lt;from-file-range&gt;
&lt;from-file-range&gt; &lt;to-file-range&gt; @@@</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are (number of parents +
1) @ characters in the chunk header for combined diff
format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unlike the traditional unified
diff format, which shows two files A and B with a single
column that has - (minus &acirc; appears in A but removed in
B), + (plus &acirc; missing in A but <br>
added to B), or &quot; &quot; (space &acirc; unchanged)
prefix, this format compares two or more files file1,
file2,... with one file X, and shows how X differs from each
of fileN. One column <br>
for each of fileN is prepended to the output line to note
how X&acirc;s line is different from it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A - character in the column N
means that the line appears in fileN but it does not appear
in the result. A + character in the column N means that the
line appears in the result, <br>
and fileN does not have that line (in other words, the line
was added, from the point of view of that parent).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the above example output, the
function signature was changed from both files (hence two -
removals from both file1 and file2, plus ++ to mean one line
that was added does not <br>
appear in either file1 nor file2). Also eight other lines
are the same from file1 but do not appear in file2 (hence
prefixed with +).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When shown by git diff-tree -c,
it compares the parents of a merge commit with the merge
result (i.e. file1..fileN are the parents). When shown by
git diff-files -c, it compares <br>
the two unresolved merge parents with the working tree file
(i.e. file1 is stage 2 aka &quot;our version&quot;, file2 is
stage 3 aka &quot;their version&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OTHER DIFF FORMATS <br>
The --summary option describes newly added, deleted, renamed
and copied files. The --stat option adds diffstat(1) graph
to the output. These options can be combined with other <br>
options, such as -p, and are meant for human
consumption.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When showing a change that
involves a rename or a copy, --stat output formats the
pathnames compactly by combining common prefix and suffix of
the pathnames. For example, a <br>
change that moves arch/i386/Makefile to arch/x86/Makefile
while modifying 4 lines will be shown like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">arch/{i386 =&gt; x86}/Makefile |
4 +--</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The --numstat option gives the
diffstat(1) information but is designed for easier machine
consumption. An entry in --numstat output looks like
this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 2 README <br>
3 1 arch/{i386 =&gt; x86}/Makefile</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">That is, from left to right:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. the number of added
lines;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. a tab;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. the number of deleted
lines;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. a tab;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5. pathname (possibly with
rename/copy information);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6. a newline.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When -z output option is in
effect, the output is formatted this way:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 2 README NUL <br>
3 1 NUL arch/i386/Makefile NUL arch/x86/Makefile NUL</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">That is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. the number of added
lines;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. a tab;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. the number of deleted
lines;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. a tab;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5. a NUL (only exists if
renamed/copied);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6. pathname in preimage;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">7. a NUL (only exists if
renamed/copied);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">8. pathname in postimage (only
exists if renamed/copied);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">9. a NUL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The extra NUL before the
preimage path in renamed case is to allow scripts that read
the output to tell if the current record being read is a
single-path record or a rename/copy <br>
record without reading ahead. After reading added and
deleted lines, reading up to NUL would yield the pathname,
but if that is NUL, the record will show two paths.</p>
