<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
To submit a script is to create a batch job that executes
the script. A script is submitted by a request to a batch
server. The qsub utility is a user-accessible batch client
<br>
that submits a script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Upon successful completion, the
qsub utility shall have created a batch job that will
execute the submitted script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The qsub utility shall submit a
script by sending a Queue Job Request to a batch server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The qsub utility shall place the
value of the following environment variables in the
Variable_List attribute of the batch job: HOME, LANG,
LOGNAME, PATH, MAIL, SHELL, and TZ. <br>
The name of the environment variable shall be the current
name prefixed with the string PBS_O_.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: If the current value of
the HOME variable in the environment space of the qsub
utility is /aa/bb/cc, then qsub shall place
PBS_O_HOME=/aa/bb/cc in the Variable_List <br>
attribute of the batch job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition to the variables
described above, the qsub utility shall add the following
variables with the indicated values to the variable
list:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PBS_O_WORKDIR The absolute path
of the current working directory of the qsub utility
process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PBS_O_HOST The name of the host
on which the qsub utility is running.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The qsub utility shall conform to the Base Definitions
volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax
Guidelines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options shall be
supported by the implementation:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;a date_time <br>
Define the time at which a batch job becomes eligible for
execution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The qsub utility shall accept an
option-argument that conforms to the syntax of the time
operand of the touch utility.</p>

<br>
Note: The server that initiates execution of the batch job
will add other variables to the batch job&rsquo;s
environment; see Section 3.2.2.1, Batch Job Execution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The qsub utility shall set the
Execution_Time attribute of the batch job to the number of
seconds since the Epoch that is equivalent to the local time
expressed by the <br>
value of the date_time option-argument. The Epoch is defined
in the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008,
Section 3.150, Epoch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the &acirc;a option is not
presented to the qsub utility, the utility shall set the
Execution_Time attribute of the batch job to a time (number
of seconds since the Epoch) <br>
that is earlier than the time at which the utility
exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;A account_string <br>
Define the account to which the resource consumption of the
batch job should be charged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The syntax of the account_string
option-argument is unspecified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The qsub utility shall set the
Account_Name attribute of the batch job to the value of the
account_string option-argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the &acirc;A option is not
presented to the qsub utility, the utility shall omit the
Account_Name attribute from the attributes of the batch
job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;c interval <br>
Define whether the batch job should be checkpointed, and if
so, how often.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The qsub utility shall accept a
value for the interval option-argument that is one of the
following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">n No checkpointing shall be
performed on the batch job (NO_CHECKPOINT).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">s Checkpointing shall be
performed only when the batch server is shut down
(CHECKPOINT_AT_SHUTDOWN).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c Automatic periodic
checkpointing shall be performed at the Minimum_Cpu_Interval
attribute of the batch queue, in units of CPU minutes
(CHECK&acirc; <br>
POINT_AT_MIN_CPU_INTERVAL).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c=minutes Automatic periodic
checkpointing shall be performed every minutes of CPU time,
or every Minimum_Cpu_Interval minutes, whichever is greater.
The minutes argu&acirc; <br>
ment shall conform to the syntax for unsigned integers and
shall be greater than zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The qsub utility shall set the
Checkpoint attribute of the batch job to the value of the
interval option-argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the &acirc;c option is not
presented to the qsub utility, the utility shall set the
Checkpoint attribute of the batch job to the single
character &rsquo;u&rsquo; (CHECKPOINT_UNSPECI&acirc; <br>
FIED).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;C directive_prefix <br>
Define the prefix that declares a directive to the qsub
utility within the script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The directive_prefix is not a
batch job attribute; it affects the behavior of the qsub
utility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the &acirc;C option is
presented to the qsub utility, and the value of the
directive_prefix option-argument is the null string, the
utility shall not scan the script file <br>
for directives. If the &acirc;C option is not presented to
the qsub utility, then the value of the PBS_DPREFIX
environment variable is used. If the environment variable is
<br>
not defined, then #PBS encoded in the portable character set
is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;e path_name <br>
Define the path to be used for the standard error stream of
the batch job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The qsub utility shall accept a
path_name option-argument which can be preceded by a host
name element of the form hostname:.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the path_name option-argument
constitutes an absolute pathname, the qsub utility shall set
the Error_Path attribute of the batch job to the value of
the path_name <br>
option-argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the path_name option-argument
constitutes a relative pathname and no host name element is
specified, the qsub utility shall set the Error_Path
attribute of the batch <br>
job to the value of the absolute pathname derived by
expanding the path_name option-argument relative to the
current directory of the process executing qsub.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the path_name option-argument
constitutes a relative pathname and a host name element is
specified, the qsub utility shall set the Error_Path
attribute of the batch <br>
job to the value of the path_name option-argument without
expansion. The host name element shall be included.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the path_name option-argument
does not include a host name element, the qsub utility shall
prefix the pathname with hostname:, where hostname is the
name of the host <br>
upon which the qsub utility is being executed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the &acirc;e option is not
presented to the qsub utility, the utility shall set the
Error_Path attribute of the batch job to the host name and
path of the current direc&acirc; <br>
tory of the submitting process and the default filename.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default filename for
standard error has the following format:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">job_name.esequence_number</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;h Specify that a USER
hold is applied to the batch job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The qsub utility shall set the
value of the Hold_Types attribute of the batch job to the
value USER.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the &acirc;h option is not
presented to the qsub utility, the utility shall set the
Hold_Types attribute of the batch job to the value
NO_HOLD.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;j join_list <br>
Define which streams of the batch job are to be merged. The
qsub &acirc;j option shall accept a value for the join_list
option-argument that is a string of alphanumeric char&acirc;
<br>
acters in the portable character set (see the Base
Definitions volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008, Section 6.1,
Portable Character Set).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The qsub utility shall accept a
join_list option-argument that consists of one or more of
the characters &rsquo;e&rsquo; and &rsquo;o&rsquo;, or the
single character &rsquo;n&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All of the other batch job
output streams specified will be merged into the output
stream represented by the character listed first in the
join_list option-argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For each unique character in the
join_list option-argument, the qsub utility shall add a
value to the Join_Path attribute of the batch job as
follows, each representing <br>
a different batch job stream to join:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">e The standard error of the
batch job (JOIN_STD_ERROR).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o The standard output of the
batch job (JOIN_STD_OUTPUT).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An existing Join_Path attribute
can be cleared by the following join type:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">n NO_JOIN</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If &rsquo;n&rsquo; is specified,
then no files are joined. The qsub utility shall consider it
an error if any join type other than &rsquo;n&rsquo; is
combined with join type &rsquo;n&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Strictly conforming applications
shall not repeat any of the characters &rsquo;e&rsquo;,
&rsquo;o&rsquo;, or &rsquo;n&rsquo; within the join_list
option-argument. The qsub utility shall permit the
repeti&acirc; <br>
tion of characters, but shall not assign additional meaning
to the repeated characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An implementation may define
other join types. The conformance document for an
implementation shall describe any additional batch job
streams, how they are specified, <br>
their internal behavior, and how they affect the behavior of
the utility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the &acirc;j option is not
presented to the qsub utility, the utility shall set the
value of the Join_Path attribute of the batch job to
NO_JOIN.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;k keep_list <br>
Define which output of the batch job to retain on the
execution host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The qsub &acirc;k option shall
accept a value for the keep_list option-argument that is a
string of alphanumeric characters in the portable character
set (see the Base Defi&acirc; <br>
nitions volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008, Section 6.1, Portable
Character Set).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The qsub utility shall accept a
keep_list option-argument that consists of one or more of
the characters &rsquo;e&rsquo; and &rsquo;o&rsquo;, or the
single character &rsquo;n&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For each unique character in the
keep_list option-argument, the qsub utility shall add a
value to the Keep_Files attribute of the batch job as
follows, each represent&acirc; <br>
ing a different batch job stream to keep:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">e The standard error of the
batch job (KEEP_STD_ERROR).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o The standard output of the
batch job (KEEP_STD_OUTPUT).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If both &rsquo;e&rsquo; and
&rsquo;o&rsquo; are specified, then both files are retained.
An existing Keep_Files attribute can be cleared by the
following keep type:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">n NO_KEEP</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If &rsquo;n&rsquo; is specified,
then no files are retained. The qsub utility shall consider
it an error if any keep type other than &rsquo;n&rsquo; is
combined with keep type &rsquo;n&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Strictly conforming applications
shall not repeat any of the characters &rsquo;e&rsquo;,
&rsquo;o&rsquo;, or &rsquo;n&rsquo; within the keep_list
option-argument. The qsub utility shall permit the
repeti&acirc; <br>
tion of characters, but shall not assign additional meaning
to the repeated characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An implementation may define
other keep types. The conformance document for an
implementation shall describe any additional keep types, how
they are specified, their <br>
internal behavior, and how they affect the behavior of the
utility. If the &acirc;k option is not presented to the qsub
utility, the utility shall set the Keep_Files <br>
attribute of the batch job to the value NO_KEEP.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;m mail_options <br>
Define the points in the execution of the batch job at which
the batch server that manages the batch job shall send mail
about a change in the state of the batch job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The qsub &acirc;m option shall
accept a value for the mail_options option-argument that is
a string of alphanumeric characters in the portable
character set (see the Base <br>
Definitions volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008, Section 6.1,
Portable Character Set).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The qsub utility shall accept a
value for the mail_options option-argument that is a string
of one or more of the characters &rsquo;e&rsquo;,
&rsquo;b&rsquo;, and &rsquo;a&rsquo;, or the single
character <br>
&rsquo;n&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For each unique character in the
mail_options option-argument, the qsub utility shall add a
value to the Mail_Users attribute of the batch job as
follows, each repre&acirc; <br>
senting a different time during the life of a batch job at
which to send mail:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">e MAIL_AT_EXIT</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">b MAIL_AT_BEGINNING</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a MAIL_AT_ABORT</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If any of these characters are
duplicated in the mail_options option-argument, the
duplicates shall be ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An existing Mail_Points
attribute can be cleared by the following mail type:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">n NO_MAIL</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If &rsquo;n&rsquo; is specified,
then mail is not sent. The qsub utility shall consider it an
error if any mail type other than &rsquo;n&rsquo; is
combined with mail type &rsquo;n&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Strictly conforming applications
shall not repeat any of the characters &rsquo;e&rsquo;,
&rsquo;b&rsquo;, &rsquo;a&rsquo;, or &rsquo;n&rsquo; within
the mail_options option-argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The qsub utility shall permit
the repetition of characters, but shall not assign
additional meaning to the repeated characters. An
implementation may define other mail <br>
types. The conformance document for an implementation shall
describe any additional mail types, how they are specified,
their internal behavior, and how they affect the <br>
behavior of the utility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the &acirc;m option is not
presented to the qsub utility, the utility shall set the
Mail_Points attribute to the value MAIL_AT_ABORT.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;M mail_list <br>
Define the list of users to which a batch server that
executes the batch job shall send mail, if the server sends
mail about the batch job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The syntax of the mail_list
option-argument is unspecified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the implementation of the
qsub utility uses a name service to locate users, the
utility should accept the syntax used by the name
service.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the implementation of the
qsub utility does not use a name service to locate users,
the implementation should accept the following syntax for
user names:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mail_address[,,mail_address,,
...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The interpretation of
mail_address is implementation-defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The qsub utility shall set the
Mail_Users attribute of the batch job to the value of the
mail_list option-argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the &acirc;M option is not
presented to the qsub utility, the utility shall place only
the user name and host name for the current process in the
Mail_Users attribute of <br>
the batch job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;N name Define the name of
the batch job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The qsub &acirc;N option shall
accept a value for the name option-argument that is a string
of up to 15 alphanumeric characters in the portable
character set (see the Base <br>
Definitions volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008, Section 6.1,
Portable Character Set) where the first character is
alphabetic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The qsub utility shall set the
value of the Job_Name attribute of the batch job to the

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the &acirc;N option is not
presented to the qsub utility, the utility shall set the
Job_Name attribute of the batch job to the name of the
script argument from which the <br>
directory specification if any, has been removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the &acirc;N option is not
presented to the qsub utility, and the script is read from
standard input, the utility shall set the Job_Name attribute
of the batch job to the <br>
value STDIN.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;o path_name <br>
Define the path for the standard output of the batch
job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The qsub utility shall accept a
path_name option-argument that conforms to the syntax of the
path_name element defined in the System Interfaces volume of
POSIX.1&acirc;2008, <br>
which can be preceded by a host name element of the form
hostname:.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the path_name option-argument
constitutes an absolute pathname, the qsub utility shall set
the Output_Path attribute of the batch job to the value of
the path_name <br>
option-argument without expansion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the path_name option-argument
constitutes a relative pathname and no host name element is
specified, the qsub utility shall set the Output_Path
attribute of the <br>
batch job to the pathname derived by expanding the value of
the path_name option-argument relative to the current
directory of the process executing the qsub.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the path_name option-argument
constitutes a relative pathname and a host name element is
specified, the qsub utility shall set the Output_Path
attribute of the batch <br>
job to the value of the path_name option-argument without
expansion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the path_name option-argument
does not specify a host name element, the qsub utility shall
prefix the pathname with hostname:, where hostname is the
name of the host <br>
upon which the qsub utility is executing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the &acirc;o option is not
presented to the qsub utility, the utility shall set the
Output_Path attribute of the batch job to the host name and
path of the current direc&acirc; <br>
tory of the submitting process and the default filename.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default filename for
standard output has the following format:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;p priority <br>
Define the priority the batch job should have relative to
other batch jobs owned by the batch server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The qsub utility shall set the
Priority attribute of the batch job to the value of the
priority option-argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the &acirc;p option is not
presented to the qsub utility, the value of the Priority
attribute is implementation-defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The qsub utility shall accept a
value for the priority option-argument that conforms to the
syntax for signed decimal integers, and which is not less
than &acirc;1024 and not <br>
greater than 1023.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;q destination <br>
Define the destination of the batch job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The destination is not a batch
job attribute; it determines the batch server, and possibly
the batch queue, to which the qsub utility batch queues the
batch job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The qsub utility shall submit
the script to the batch server named by the destination
option-argument or the server that owns the batch queue
named in the destination <br>
option-argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The qsub utility shall accept an
option-argument for the &acirc;q option that conforms to the
syntax for a destination (see Section 3.3.2,
Destination).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the &acirc;q option is not

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The qsub utility shall allow
only one pathname for a given host name. The qsub utility
shall allow only one pathname that is missing a
corresponding host name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The qsub utility shall add a
value to the Shell_Path_List attribute of the batch job for
each entry in the path_name_list option-argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the &acirc;S option is not
presented to the qsub utility, the utility shall set the
Shell_Path_List attribute of the batch job to the null
string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The conformance document for an
implementation shall describe the mechanism used to set the
default shell and determine the current value of the default
shell. An <br>
implementation shall provide a means for the installation to
set the default shell to the login shell of the user under

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PBS_DPREFIX <br>
Determine the default prefix for directives within the
script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SHELL Determine the pathname of
the preferred command language interpreter of the user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TZ Determine the timezone used
to interpret the date-time option-argument. If TZ is unset
or null, an unspecified default timezone shall be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS <br>
Once created, a batch job exists until it exits, aborts, or
is deleted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After a batch job is created by
the qsub utility, batch servers might route, execute,
modify, or delete the batch job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDOUT <br>
The qsub utility writes the batch job_identifier assigned to
the batch job to standard output, unless the &acirc;z option
is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDERR <br>
The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT FILES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTENDED DESCRIPTION <br>
Script Preservation <br>
The qsub utility shall make the script available to the
server executing the batch job in such a way that the server
executes the script as it exists at the time of
submission.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The qsub utility can send a copy
of the script to the server with the Queue Job Request or
store a temporary copy of the script in a location specified
to the server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Option Specification <br>
A script can contain directives to the qsub utility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The qsub utility shall scan the
lines of the script for directives, skipping blank lines,
until the first line that begins with a string other than
the directive string; if <br>
directives occur on subsequent lines, the utility shall
ignore those directives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Lines are separated by a
&lt;newline&gt;. If the first line of the script begins with
&quot;#!&quot; or a &lt;colon&gt; (&rsquo;:&rsquo;), then it
is skipped. The qsub utility shall process a line in the
script <br>
as a directive if and only if the string of characters from
the first non-white-space character on the line until the
first &lt;space&gt; or &lt;tab&gt; on the line match the
directive pre&acirc; <br>
fix. If a line in the script contains a directive and the
final characters of the line are &lt;backslash&gt; and
&lt;newline&gt;, then the next line shall be interpreted as
a continuation of <br>
that directive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The qsub utility shall process
the options and option-arguments contained on the directive
prefix line using the same syntax as if the options were
input on the qsub utility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The qsub utility shall continue
to process a directive prefix line until after a
&lt;newline&gt; is encountered. An implementation may ignore
lines which, according to the syntax of <br>
the shell that will interpret the script, are comments. An
implementation shall describe in the conformance document
the format of any shell comments that it will recognize.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If an option is present in both
a directive and the arguments to the qsub utility, the
utility shall ignore the option and the corresponding
option-argument, if any, in the <br>
directive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If an option that is present in
the directive is not present in the arguments to the qsub
utility, the utility shall process the option and the
option-argument, if any.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order of preference, the qsub
utility shall select the directive prefix from one of the
following sources:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* If the &acirc;C option is
presented to the utility, the value of the directive_prefix
option-argument</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* If the environment variable
PBS_DPREFIX is defined, the value of that variable</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The four-character string
&quot;#PBS&quot; encoded in the portable character set</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the &acirc;C option is
present in the script file it shall be ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The following exit values shall be returned:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 Successful completion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following sections are
informative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">APPLICATION USAGE <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RATIONALE <br>
The qsub utility allows users to create a batch job that
will process the script specified as the operand of the
utility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The options of the qsub utility
allow users to control many aspects of the queuing and
execution of a batch job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &acirc;a option allows users
to designate the time after which the batch job will become
eligible to run. By specifying an execution time, users can
take advantage of resources at <br>
off-peak hours, synchronize jobs with chronologically
predictable events, and perhaps take advantage of off-peak
pricing of computing time. For these reasons and others, a
timing <br>
option is existing practice on the part of almost every
batch system, including NQS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &acirc;A option allows users
to specify the account that will be charged for the batch
job. Support for account is not mandatory for conforming
batch servers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &acirc;C option allows users
to prescribe the prefix for directives within the script
file. The default prefix &quot;#PBS&quot; may be
inappropriate if the script will be interpreted with an <br>
alternate shell, as specified by the &acirc;S option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &acirc;c option allows users
to establish the checkpointing interval for their jobs. A
checkpointing system, which is not defined by this volume of
POSIX.1&acirc;2008, allows recovery of <br>
a batch job at the most recent checkpoint in the event of a
crash. Checkpointing is typically used for jobs that consume
expensive computing time or must meet a critical
sched&acirc; <br>
ule. Users should be allowed to make the tradeoff between
the overhead of checkpointing and the risk to the timely
completion of the batch job; therefore, this volume of <br>
POSIX.1&acirc;2008 provides the checkpointing interval
option. Support for checkpointing is optional for batch
servers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &acirc;e option allows users
to redirect the standard error streams of their jobs to a
non-default path. For example, if the submitted script
generally produces a great deal of <br>
useless error output, a user might redirect the standard
error output to the null device. Or, if the file system
holding the default location (the home directory of the
user) has <br>
too little free space, the user might redirect the standard
error stream to a file in another file system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &acirc;h option allows users
to create a batch job that is held until explicitly
released. The ability to create a held job is useful when
some external event must complete before <br>
the batch job can execute. For example, the user might
submit a held job and release it when the system load has
dropped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &acirc;j option allows users
to merge the standard error of a batch job into its standard
output stream, which has the advantage of showing the
sequential relationship between out&acirc; <br>
put and error messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &acirc;m option allows users
to designate those points in the execution of a batch job at
which mail will be sent to the submitting user, or to the
account(s) indicated by the &acirc;M <br>
option. By requesting mail notification at points of
interest in the life of a job, the submitting user, or other
designated users, can track the progress of a batch job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &acirc;N option allows users
to associate a name with the batch job. The job name in no
way affects the processing of the batch job, but rather
serves as a mnemonic handle for <br>
users. For example, the batch job name can help the user
distinguish between multiple jobs listed by the qstat
utility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &acirc;o option allows users
to redirect the standard output stream. A user might, for
example, wish to redirect to the null device the standard
output stream of a job that pro&acirc; <br>
duces copious yet superfluous output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &acirc;P option allows users
to designate the relative priority of a batch job for
selection from a queue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &acirc;q option allows users
to specify an initial queue for the batch job. If the user
specifies a routing queue, the batch server routes the batch
job to another queue for execu&acirc; <br>
tion or further routing. If the user specifies a non-routing
queue, the batch server of the queue eventually executes the
batch job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &acirc;r option allows users
to control whether the submitted job will be rerun if the
controlling batch node fails during execution of the batch
job. The &acirc;r option likewise <br>
allows users to indicate whether or not the batch job is
eligible to be rerun by the qrerun utility. Some jobs cannot
be correctly rerun because of changes they make in the state
<br>
of databases or other aspects of their environment. This
volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008 specifies that the default, if
the &acirc;r option is not presented to the utility, will be
that the <br>
batch job cannot be rerun, since the result of rerunning a
non-rerunnable job might be catastrophic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &acirc;S option allows users
to specify the program (usually a shell) that will be
invoked to process the script of the batch job. This option
has been modified to allow a list of <br>
shell names and locations associated with different
hosts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &acirc;u option is useful
when the submitting user is authorized to use more than one
account on a given host, in which case the &acirc;u option
allows the user to select from among <br>
those accounts. The option-argument is a list of user-host
pairs, so that the submitting user can provide different
user identifiers for different nodes in the event the batch
<br>
job is routed. The &acirc;u option provides a lot of
flexibility to accommodate sites with complex account
structures. Users that have the same user identifier on all
the hosts they <br>
are authorized to use will not need to use the &acirc;u
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &acirc;V option allows users
to export all their current environment variables, as of the
time the batch job is submitted, to the context of the
processes of the batch job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &acirc;v option allows users
to export specific environment variables from their current
process to the processes of the batch job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &acirc;z option allows users
to suppress the writing of the batch job identifier to
standard output. The &acirc;z option is an existing NQS
practice that has been standardized.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Historically, the qsub utility
has served the batch job-submission function in the NQS
system, the existing practice on which it is based. Some
changes and additions have been <br>
made to the qsub utility in this volume of
POSIX.1&acirc;2008, vis-a-vis NQS, as a result of the
growing pool of experience with distributed batch
systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The set of features of the qsub
utility as defined in this volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008
appears to incorporate all the common existing practice on
potentially conforming platforms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FUTURE DIRECTIONS <br>
The qsub utility may be removed in a future version.</p>
