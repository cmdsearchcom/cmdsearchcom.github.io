<p>WINEGCC(1) Wine Developers Manual WINEGCC(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
winegcc - Wine C and C++ MinGW Compatible Compiler</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
winegcc [options] infile...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
winegcc is a gcc wrapper which tries to provide a MinGW
compatible compiler under Linux. This is most useful to
Win32 developers who can simply take their MinGW code from
Win&acirc; <br>
dows, and recompile it without modifications under Winelib
on Linux. wineg++ accepts mostly the same options as
winegcc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The goal of winegcc is to be
able to simply replace gcc/g++/windres with
winegcc/wineg++/wrc in a MinGW Makefile, and just recompile
the application using Winelib under Wine. <br>
While typically there are small adjustments that must be
made to the application source code and/or Makefile, it is
quite easy to do them in a fashion that is compatible
between <br>
the MinGW and Wine environments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This manual will document only
the differences from gcc; please consult the gcc manual for
more information on those options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
gcc options: All gcc options are supported, and are passed
along to the backend compiler.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Bprefix <br>
This option specifies where to find the executables,
libraries, include files, and data files of the compiler
itself. This is a standard gcc option that has been extended
<br>
to recognize a prefix ending with
&rsquo;/tools/winebuild&rsquo;, in which case winegcc enters
a special mode for building Wine itself. Developers should
avoid prefixes ending with <br>
the magic suffix, or if that is not possible, simply express
it differently, such as &rsquo;/tools/winebuild/&rsquo;, to
avoid the special behaviour.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-short-wchar <br>
Override the underlying type for wchar_t to be the default
for the target, instead of using short unsigned int, which
is the default for Win32.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mconsole <br>
This option passes &rsquo;--subsystem console&rsquo; to
winebuild, to build console applications. It is the
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-cygwin <br>
Use Wine implementation of MSVCRT, instead of linking
against the host system libc. This is necessary for the vast
majority of Win32 applications, as they typically depend
<br>
on various features of MSVCRT. This switch is also used by
the MinGW compiler to link against MSVCRT on Windows,
instead of linking against Cygwin libc. Sharing the syntax
<br>
with MinGW makes it very easy to write Makefiles that work
under Wine, MinGW+MSYS, or MinGW+Cygwin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-municode <br>
Set the default entry point of the application to be the
Unicode wmain() instead of the standard main().</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mwindows <br>
This option adds -lgdi32, -lcomdlg32, and -lshell32 to the
list of default libraries, and passes &rsquo;--subsystem
windows&rsquo; to winebuild to build graphical
applications.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nodefaultlibs <br>
Do not use the standard system libraries when linking. These
include at a minimum -lkernel32, -luser32, -ladvapi32, and
any default libraries used by the backend compiler. <br>
The -mwindows option augments the list of default libraries
as described above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nostartfiles <br>
Do not add the winecrt0 library when linking.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wb,option <br>
Pass an option to winebuild. If option contains commas, it
is split into multiple options at the commas.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
WINEBUILD <br>
Specifies the path and name of the winebuild binary that
will be launched automatically by winegcc. If not set,
winegcc will look for a file named winebuild in the
path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEFINES <br>
winegcc defines __WINE__, for code that needs to know when
it is being compiled under Wine. It also defines WIN32,
_WIN32, __WIN32, __WIN32__, __WINNT, and __WINNT__ for
compati&acirc; <br>
bility with MinGW.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
The dllimport/dllexport attributes are not supported at the
moment, due to lack of support for these features in the ELF
version of gcc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Static linking is not currently
supported against Wine DLLs. As a result, the -static,
--static, and -Wl,-static options will generate an
error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bugs can be reported on the Wine
bug tracker
&acirc;&uml;http://bugs.winehq.org&acirc;&copy;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHORS <br>
winegcc was written by Dimitrie O. Paun.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AVAILABILITY <br>
winegcc is part of the Wine distribution, which is available
through WineHQ, the Wine development headquarters
