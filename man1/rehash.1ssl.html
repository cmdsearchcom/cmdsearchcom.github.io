<p>REHASH(1) OpenSSL REHASH(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
c_rehash, rehash - Create symbolic links to files named by
the hash values</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
openssl rehash [-h] [-help] [-old] [-n] [-v] [
directory...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c_rehash flags...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
On some platforms, the OpenSSL rehash command is available
as an external script called c_rehash. They are functionally
equivalent, except for minor differences noted below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rehash scans directories and
calculates a hash value of each &quot;.pem&quot;,
&quot;.crt&quot;, &quot;.cer&quot;, or &quot;.crl&quot; file
in the specified directory list and creates symbolic links
for each file, <br>
where the name of the link is the hash value. (If the
platform does not support symbolic links, a copy is made.)
This utility is useful as many programs that use OpenSSL
<br>
require directories to be set up like this in order to find
certificates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If any directories are named on
the command line, then those are processed in turn. If not,
then the SSL_CERT_DIR environment variable is consulted;
this should be a colon- <br>
separated list of directories, like the Unix PATH variable.
If that is not set then the default directory
(installation-specific but often /usr/local/ssl/certs) is
processed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order for a directory to be
processed, the user must have write permissions on that
directory, otherwise an error will be generated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The links created are of the
form &quot;HHHHHHHH.D&quot;, where each H is a hexadecimal
character and D is a single decimal digit. When processing a
directory, rehash will first remove <br>
all links that have a name in that syntax, even if they are
being used for some other purpose. To skip the removal step,
use the -n flag. Hashes for CRL&rsquo;s look similar except
<br>
the letter r appears after the period, like this:
&quot;HHHHHHHH.rD&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Multiple objects may have the
same hash; they will be indicated by incrementing the D
value. Duplicates are found by comparing the full SHA-1
fingerprint. A warning will be <br>
displayed if a duplicate is found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A warning will also be displayed
if there are files that cannot be parsed as either a
certificate or a CRL or if more than one such object appears
in the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Script Configuration <br>
The c_rehash script uses the openssl program to compute the
hashes and fingerprints. If not found in the user&rsquo;s
PATH, then set the OPENSSL environment variable to the full
<br>
pathname. Any program can be used, it will be invoked as
follows for either a certificate or CRL:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$OPENSSL x509 -hash -fingerprint
-noout -in FILENAME <br>
$OPENSSL crl -hash -fingerprint -noout -in FILENAME</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where FILENAME is the filename.
It must output the hash of the file on the first line, and
the fingerprint on the second, optionally prefixed with some
text and an equals sign.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-help -h <br>
Display a brief usage message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-old <br>
Use old-style hashing (MD5, as opposed to SHA-1) for
generating links to be used for releases before 1.0.0. Note
that current versions will not use the old style.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Do not remove existing links.
This is needed when keeping new and old-style links in the
same directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Print messages about old
links removed and new links created. By default, rehash only
lists each directory as it is processed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
OPENSSL <br>
The path to an executable to use to generate hashes and
fingerprints (see above).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SSL_CERT_DIR <br>
Colon separated list of directories to operate on. Ignored
if directories are listed on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
openssl(1), crl(1). x509(1).</p>
