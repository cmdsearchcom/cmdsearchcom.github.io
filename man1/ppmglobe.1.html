<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ppmglobe - generate strips to glue onto a sphere</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ppmglobe [-background=colorname] [-closeok] stripcount
[filename]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Minimum unique abbreviation of
option is acceptable. You may use double hyphens instead of
single hyphen to denote options. You may use white space in
place of the equals sign <br>
to separate an option name from its value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This program is part of Netpbm(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ppmglobe does the inverse of a
cylindrical projection of a sphere. Starting with a
cylindrical projection, it produces an image you can cut up
and glue onto a sphere to obtain <br>
the spherical image of which it is the cylindrical
projection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">What is a cylindrical
projection? Imagine a map of the Earth on flat paper. There
are lots of different ways cartographers show the three
dimensional information in such a two <br>
dimensional map. The cylindrical projection is one. You
could make a cylindrical projection by tracing as folows:
wrap a rectangular sheet of paper around the globe, touching
<br>
the globe at the Equator. For each point of color on the
globe, run a horizontal line from the axis of the globe
through that point and out to the paper. Mark the same color
on <br>
the paper there. Lay the paper out flat and you have a
cylindrical projection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here&rsquo;s where ppmglobe
comes in: Pass the image on that paper through ppmglobe and
what comes out the other side looks something like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example of map of the earth run
through ppmglobe</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You could cut out the strips and
glue it onto a sphere and you&rsquo;d have a copy of the
original globe.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that cylindrical
projections are not what you normally see as maps of the
Earth. You&rsquo;re more likely to see a Mercator
projection. In the Mercator projection, the Earth <br>
gets stretched North-South as well as East-West as you move
away from the Equator. It was invented for use in
navigation, because you can draw straight compass courses on
it, <br>
but is used today because it is pretty.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can find maps of planets at
maps.jpl.nasa.gov
&acirc;&uml;http://maps.jpl.nasa.gov&acirc;&copy; .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PARAMETERS <br>
stripcount is the number of strips ppmglobe is to generate
in the output. More strips makes it easier to fit onto a
sphere (less stretching, tearing, and crumpling of paper),
<br>
but makes you do more cutting out of the strips.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The strips are all the same
width. If the number of columns of pixels in the image
doesn&rsquo;t evenly divide by the number of strips,
ppmglobe truncates the image on the right to <br>
create nothing but whole strips. In the pathological case
that there are fewer columns of pixels than the number of
strips you asked for, ppmglobe fails.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Before Netpbm 10.32 (February
2006), instead of truncating the image on the right,
ppmglobe produces a fractional strip on the right.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">filename is the name of the
input file. If you don&rsquo;t specify this, ppmglobe reads
the image from Standard Input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-background=colorname <br>
This specifies the color that goes between the strips.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specify the color (color) as
described for the argument of the ppm_parsecolor() library
routine &acirc;&uml;libppm.html#colorname&acirc;&copy; .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is black.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option was new in Netpbm
10.31 (December 2005). Before that, the background is always
black.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-closeok <br>
This means it is OK if the background isn&rsquo;t exactly
the color you specify. Sometimes, it is impossible to
represent a named color exactly due to the precision (i.e.
max&acirc; <br>
val) of the image&rsquo;s color space. If you specify
-closeok and ppmglobe can&rsquo;t represent the color you
name exactly, it will use instead the closest color to it
that is pos&acirc; <br>
sible. If you don&rsquo;t specify closeok, ppmglobe fails in
that situation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option was new in Netpbm
10.31 (December 2005).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY <br>
ppmglobe was new in Netpbm 10.16 (June 2003).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is derived from Max
Gensthaler&rsquo;s ppmglobemap.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHORS <br>
Max Gensthaler wrote a program he called ppmglobemap in June
2003 and suggested it for inclusion in Netpbm. Bryan
Henderson modified the code slightly and included it in
Netpbm <br>
as ppmglobe.</p>
