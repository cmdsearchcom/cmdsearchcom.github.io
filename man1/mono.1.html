mono - Mono's ECMA-CLI native code generator (Just-in-Time and Ahead-of-Time)

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<i>mono</i> is a runtime implementation of the ECMA Common Language
  Infrastructure. This can be used to run ECMA and .NET applications.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The runtime contains a native code generator that transforms the Common
  Intermediate Language into native code.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The code generator can operate in two modes: just in time compilation (JIT) or
  ahead of time compilation (AOT). Since code can be dynamically loaded, the
  runtime environment and the JIT are always present, even if code is compiled
  ahead of time.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The runtime loads the specified <i>file</i> and optionally passes the
  <i>arguments</i> to it. The <i>file</i> is an ECMA assembly. They typically
  have a .exe or .dll extension.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The runtime provides a number of configuration options for running applications,
  for developing and debugging, and for testing and debugging the runtime
  itself.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <i>mono</i> command uses the Boehm conservative garbage collector while the
  <i>mono-sgen</i> command uses a moving and generational garbage collector.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="PORTABILITY"><a class="selflink" href="#PORTABILITY">PORTABILITY</a></h1>
On Unix-based systems, Mono provides a mechanism to emulate the Windows-style
  file access, this includes providing a case insensitive view of the file
  system, directory separator mapping (from \ to /) and stripping the drive
  letters.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This functionality is enabled by setting the <b>MONO_IOMAP</b> environment
  variable to one of <b>all, drive</b> and <b>case.</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
See the description for <b>MONO_IOMAP</b> in the environment variables section
  for more details.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="RUNTIME_OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#RUNTIME_OPTIONS">RUNTIME
  OPTIONS</a></h1>
The following options are available:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>--aot</b>, <b>--aot[=options]</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This option is used to precompile the CIL code in the
      specified assembly to native code. The generated code is stored in a file
      with the extension .so. This file will be automatically picked up by the
      runtime when the assembly is executed. Ahead-of-Time compilation is most
      useful if you use it in combination with the -O=all,-shared flag which
      enables all of the optimizations in the code generator to be performed.
      Some of those optimizations are not practical for Just-in-Time compilation
      since they might be very time consuming. Unlike the .NET Framework,
      Ahead-of-Time compilation will not generate domain independent code: it
      generates the same code that the Just-in-Time compiler would produce.
      Since most applications use a single domain, this is fine. If you want to
      optimize the generated code for use in multi-domain applications, consider
      using the -O=shared flag. This pre-compiles the methods, but the original
      assembly is still required to execute as this one contains the metadata
      and exception information which is not available on the generated file.
      When precompiling code, you might want to compile with all optimizations
      (-O=all). Pre-compiled code is position independent code. Pre compilation
      is just a mechanism to reduce startup time, increase code sharing across
      multiple mono processes and avoid just-in-time compilation program startup
      costs. The original assembly must still be present, as the metadata is
      contained there. AOT code typically can not be moved from one computer to
      another (CPU-specific optimizations that are detected at runtime) so you
      should not try to move the pre-generated assemblies or package the
      pre-generated assemblies for deployment. A few options are available as a
      parameter to the <b>--aot</b> command line option. The options are
      separated by commas, and more than one can be specified:</dd>

      a particular target. The words `program', `all' and `disabled' have
      special meaning. `program' refers to the main program being executed, and
      `all' means all the method calls. The `disabled' option is used to start
      up with tracing disabled. It can be enabled at a later point in time in
      the program by sending the SIGUSR2 signal to the runtime. Assemblies are

    <pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
	mono --trace=System app.exe
<div class="Pp"></div>

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ATTACH_SUPPORT"><a class="selflink" href="#ATTACH_SUPPORT">ATTACH
  SUPPORT</a></h1>
The Mono runtime allows external processes to attach to a running process and
  load assemblies into the running program. To attach to the process, a special
  protocol is implemented in the Mono.Management assembly.
<div class="Pp"></div>
With this support it is possible to load assemblies that have an entry point
  (they are created with -target:exe or -target:winexe) to be loaded and
  executed in the Mono process.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The code is loaded into the root domain, and it starts execution on the special
  runtime attach thread. The attached program should create its own threads and
  return after invocation.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This support allows for example debugging applications by having the csharp
  shell attach to running processes.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="PROFILING"><a class="selflink" href="#PROFILING">PROFILING</a></h1>
The mono runtime includes a profiler that can be used to explore various
  performance related problems in your application. The profiler is activated by
  passing the --profile command line argument to the Mono runtime, the format
  is:
<pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
	--profile[=profiler[:profiler_args]]
<div class="Pp"></div>
</pre>
Mono has a built-in profiler called 'default' (and is also the default if no
  arguments are specified), but developers can write custom profilers, see the
  section &quot;CUSTOM PROFILERS&quot; for more details.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If a <i>profiler</i> is not specified, the default profiler is used. The
  <i>profiler_args</i> is a profiler-specific string of options for the profiler
  itself. The default profiler accepts the following options 'alloc' to profile
  memory consumption by the application; 'time' to profile the time spent on
  each routine; 'jit' to collect time spent JIT-compiling methods and 'stat' to
  perform sample statistical profiling. If no options are provided the default
  is 'alloc,time,jit'.
<div class="Pp"></div>
By default the profile data is printed to stdout: to change this, use the
  'file=filename' option to output the data to filename. For example:
<pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
	mono --profile program.exe
<div class="Pp"></div>
</pre>
That will run the program with the default profiler and will do time and
  allocation profiling.
<pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
	mono --profile=default:stat,alloc,file=prof.out program.exe
<div class="Pp"></div>
</pre>
Will do sample statistical profiling and allocation profiling on program.exe.
  The profile data is put in prof.out. Note that the statistical profiler has a
  very low overhead and should be the preferred profiler to use (for better
  output use the full path to the mono binary when running and make sure you
  have installed the addr2line utility that comes from the binutils package).
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="LOG_PROFILER"><a class="selflink" href="#LOG_PROFILER">LOG
  PROFILER</a></h1>
This is the most advanced profiler.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The Mono <i>log</i> profiler can be used to collect a lot of information about a
  program running in the Mono runtime. This data can be used (both while the
  process is running and later) to do analyses of the program behaviour,
  determine resource usage, performance issues or even look for particular
  execution patterns.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This is accomplished by logging the events provided by the Mono runtime through
  the profiling interface and periodically writing them to a file which can be
  later inspected with the mprof-report(1) tool.
<div class="Pp"></div>
More information about how to use the log profiler is available on the
  mprof-report(1) page.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CUSTOM_PROFILERS"><a class="selflink" href="#CUSTOM_PROFILERS">CUSTOM
  PROFILERS</a></h1>
Mono provides a mechanism for loading other profiling modules which in the form
  of shared libraries. These profiling modules can hook up to various parts of
  the Mono runtime to gather information about the code being executed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To use a third party profiler you must pass the name of the profiler to Mono,
  like this:
<pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
	mono --profile=custom program.exe
<div class="Pp"></div>
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
In the above sample Mono will load the user defined profiler from the shared
  library `mono-profiler-custom.so'. This profiler module must be on your
  dynamic linker library path.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A list of other third party profilers is available from Mono's web site
  (www.mono-project.com/docs/advanced/performance-tips/)
<div class="Pp"></div>
Custom profiles are written as shared libraries. The shared library must be
  called `mono-profiler-NAME.so' where `NAME' is the name of your profiler.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For a sample of how to write your own custom profiler look in the Mono source
  tree for in the samples/profiler.c.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CODE_COVERAGE"><a class="selflink" href="#CODE_COVERAGE">CODE
  COVERAGE</a></h1>
Mono ships with a code coverage module. This module is activated by using the
  Mono --profile=cov option. The format is:
  <b>--profile=cov[:assembly-name[/namespace]] test-suite.exe</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
By default code coverage will default to all the assemblies loaded, you can
  limit this by specifying the assembly name, for example to perform code
  coverage in the routines of your program use, for example the following
  command line limits the code coverage to routines in the &quot;demo&quot;
  assembly:
<pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
	mono --profile=cov:demo demo.exe
<div class="Pp"></div>
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Notice that the <i>assembly-name</i> does not include the extension.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can further restrict the code coverage output by specifying a namespace:
<pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
	mono --profile=cov:demo/My.Utilities demo.exe
<div class="Pp"></div>
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Which will only perform code coverage in the given assembly and namespace.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Typical output looks like this:
<pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
	Not covered: Class:.ctor ()
	Not covered: Class:A ()
	Not covered: Driver:.ctor ()
	Not covered: Driver:method ()
	Partial coverage: Driver:Main ()
		offset 0x000a
<div class="Pp"></div>
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The offsets displayed are IL offsets.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A more powerful coverage tool is available in the module `monocov'. See the
  monocov(1) man page for details.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="AOT_PROFILING"><a class="selflink" href="#AOT_PROFILING">AOT
  PROFILING</a></h1>
You can improve startup performance by using the AOT profiler.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Typically the AOT compiler ( <b>mono --aot</b>) will not generate code for
  generic instantiations. To solve this, you can run Mono with the AOT profiler
  to find out all the generic instantiations that are used, and then instructing
  the AOT compiler to produce code for these.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This command will run the specified app.exe and produce the <b>out.aotprof</b>
  file with the data describing the generic instantiations that are needed:
<pre>
	$ mono --profile=aot:output=out.aotprof app.exe
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Once you have this data, you can pass this to Mono's AOT compiler to instruct it
  to generate code for it:
<pre>
	$ mono --aot=profile=out.aotprof
</pre>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DEBUGGING_AIDS"><a class="selflink" href="#DEBUGGING_AIDS">DEBUGGING
  AIDS</a></h1>
To debug managed applications, you can use the <b>mdb</b> command, a command
  line debugger.
<div class="Pp"></div>
It is possible to obtain a stack trace of all the active threads in Mono by
  sending the QUIT signal to Mono, you can do this from the command line, like
  this:
<pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
	kill -QUIT pid
<div class="Pp"></div>
</pre>
Where pid is the Process ID of the Mono process you want to examine. The process
  will continue running afterwards, but its state is not guaranteed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Important:</b> this is a last-resort mechanism for debugging applications and
  should not be used to monitor or probe a production application. The integrity
  of the runtime after sending this signal is not guaranteed and the application
  might crash or terminate at any given point afterwards.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>--debug=casts</b> option can be used to get more detailed information for
  Invalid Cast operations, it will provide information about the types involved.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can use the MONO_LOG_LEVEL and MONO_LOG_MASK environment variables to get
  verbose debugging output about the execution of your application within Mono.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <i>MONO_LOG_LEVEL</i> environment variable if set, the logging level is
  changed to the set value. Possible values are &quot;error&quot;,
  &quot;critical&quot;, &quot;warning&quot;, &quot;message&quot;,
  &quot;info&quot;, &quot;debug&quot;. The default value is &quot;error&quot;.
  Messages with a logging level greater then or equal to the log level will be
  printed to stdout/stderr.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Use &quot;info&quot; to track the dynamic loading of assemblies.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Use the <i>MONO_LOG_MASK</i> environment variable to limit the extent of the
  messages you get: If set, the log mask is changed to the set value. Possible
  values are &quot;asm&quot; (assembly loader), &quot;type&quot;,
  &quot;dll&quot; (native library loader), &quot;gc&quot; (garbage collector),
  &quot;cfg&quot; (config file loader), &quot;aot&quot; (precompiler),
  &quot;security&quot; (e.g. Moonlight CoreCLR support), &quot;threadpool&quot;
  (thread pool generic), &quot;io-threadpool&quot; (thread pool I/O),
  &quot;io-layer&quot; (I/O layer - sockets, handles, shared memory etc) and
  &quot;all&quot;. The default value is &quot;all&quot;. Changing the mask value
  allows you to display only messages for a certain component. You can use
  multiple masks by comma separating them. For example to see config file
  messages and assembly loader messages set you mask to &quot;asm,cfg&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The following is a common use to track down problems with P/Invoke:
<pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
	$ MONO_LOG_LEVEL=&quot;debug&quot; MONO_LOG_MASK=&quot;dll&quot; mono glue.exe
<div class="Pp"></div>
</pre>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DEBUGGING_WITH_LLDB"><a class="selflink" href="#DEBUGGING_WITH_LLDB">DEBUGGING
  WITH LLDB</a></h1>
If you are using LLDB, you can use the <b>mono.py</b> script to print some
  internal data structures with it. To use this, add this to your
  <b>$HOME/.lldbinit</b> file:
<pre>
command script import $PREFIX/lib/mono/lldb/mono.py
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Where $PREFIX is the prefix value that you used when you configured Mono
  (typically /usr).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Once this is done, then you can inspect some Mono Runtime data structures, for
  example:
<pre>
(lldb) p method
<div class="Pp"></div>
(MonoMethod *) $0 = 0x05026ac0 [mscorlib]System.OutOfMemoryException:.ctor()
</pre>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SERIALIZATION"><a class="selflink" href="#SERIALIZATION">SERIALIZATION</a></h1>
Mono's XML serialization engine by default will use a reflection-based approach
  to serialize which might be slow for continuous processing (web service
  applications). The serialization engine will determine when a class must use a
  hand-tuned serializer based on a few parameters and if needed it will produce
  a customized C# serializer for your types at runtime. This customized
  serializer then gets dynamically loaded into your application.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can control this with the MONO_XMLSERIALIZER_THS environment variable.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The possible values are <b>`no'</b> to disable the use of a C# customized
  serializer, or an integer that is the minimum number of uses before the
  runtime will produce a custom serializer (0 will produce a custom serializer
  on the first access, 50 will produce a serializer on the 50th use). Mono will
  fallback to an interpreted serializer if the serializer generation somehow
  fails. This behavior can be disabled by setting the option <b>`nofallback'</b>
  (for example: MONO_XMLSERIALIZER_THS=0,nofallback).

  <dd class="It-tag">Enables some filename rewriting support to assist

      colon-separated list of &quot;drive&quot; to strip drive letters, or
      &quot;case&quot; to do case-insensitive file matching in every directory
      in a path. &quot;all&quot; enables all rewriting methods. (Backslashes are
      always mapped to slashes if this variable is set to a valid option).
    <br/>
    For example, this would work from the shell:
    <pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
	MONO_IOMAP=drive:case
	export MONO_IOMAP
<div class="Pp"></div>
    </pre>
    If you are using mod_mono to host your web applications, you can use the
      <b>MonoIOMAP</b> directive instead, like this:
    <pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
	MonoIOMAP &lt;appalias&gt; all

    See mod_mono(8) for more details.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Additionally. Mono includes a profiler module which allows one to track what
      adjustements to file paths IOMAP code needs to do. The tracking code
      reports the managed location (full stack trace) from which the IOMAP-ed
      call was made and, on process exit, the locations where all the IOMAP-ed
      strings were created in managed code. The latter report is only
      approximate as it is not always possible to estimate the actual location
      where the string was created. The code uses simple heuristics - it
      analyzes stack trace leading back to the string allocation location and
      ignores all the managed code which lives in assemblies installed in GAC as
      well as in the class libraries shipped with Mono (since they are assumed
      to be free of case-sensitivity issues). It then reports the first location
      in the user's code - in most cases this will be the place where the string
      is allocated or very close to the location. The reporting code is
      implemented as a custom profiler module (see the &quot;PROFILING&quot;
      section) and can be loaded in the following way:

Provides a search path to the runtime where to look for library

Directories are separated by the platform path separator (colons on unix). Example:
<b>/home/username/lib:/usr/local/mono/lib</b>
Relative paths are resolved based on the launch-time current directory.
Alternative solutions to MONO_PATH include: installing libraries into
the Global Assembly Cache (see gacutil(1)) or having the dependent
libraries side-by-side with the main executable.

If you want to use Valgrind, you will find the file `mono.supp' useful, it
  contains the suppressions for the GC which trigger incorrect warnings. Use it
  like this:
<pre>
    valgrind --suppressions=mono.supp mono ...
</pre>

On some platforms, Mono can expose a set of DTrace probes (also known as
  user-land statically defined, USDT Probes).

Mono's Ping implementation for detecting network reachability can create the
  ICMP packets itself without requiring the system ping command to do the work.
  If you want to enable this on Linux for non-root users, you need to give the
  Mono binary special permissions.

As root, run this command:
<pre>
   # setcap cap_net_raw=+ep /usr/bin/mono
</pre>

  `prefix' to /usr, the assemblies will be located in /usr/lib. On Windows, the
  assemblies are loaded from the directory where mono and mint live.
