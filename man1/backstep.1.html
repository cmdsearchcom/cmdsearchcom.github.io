<p>BACKSTEP(1) BACKSTEP(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
backstep - Backstep is a program that draws icons for
minimized windows on your desktop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
backstep [options]...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Backstep is a program that draws icons for minimized windows
on your desktop. It doesn&rsquo;t depend on the window
manager or on a desktop-drawing program (for example, I use
it with <br>
Nautilus). It is meant to work with window managers that are
EWHM compliant. However, I only know for sure that it works
with Metacity and Xfwm4. And I know that it doesn&rsquo;t
work <br>
with Fluxbox and that it only partially works with Kwin
(hopefully this will be corrected soon). I haven&rsquo;t yet
tested it with other window managers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Drawing icons for minimized
windows on the desktop might be considered a step backwards
by many people (hence the name), but I find it useful to
identify minimized windows by <br>
position rather than by name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FEATURES <br>
1) Simple to use. You do not have to configure anything -
just run &rsquo;backstep&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2) Session management support -
at least to the extent that backstep adds itself to the
session so that it will be started automatically the next
time you log in to your desktop <br>
environment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3) Grouping. Windows can be
grouped together (by right clicking on their icons and
selecting a group) so that when one window from the group is
shown or hidden, all windows in <br>
the group are shown or hidden.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4) Configurable. You can make
some adjustments to the way the icons look. This is done
through a simple configuration dialog launched by
right-clicking on an icon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-?, --help Show these help options <br>
-c, --client=ID Client id for session management <br>
-n, --no-daemon Do not run as a daemon <br>
-v, --version output version information and exit <br>
--display=DISPLAY X display to use</p>
