backstep - Backstep is a program that draws icons for minimized windows on your
  desktop.

Backstep is a program that draws icons for minimized windows on your desktop. It
  doesn't depend on the window manager or on a desktop-drawing program (for
  example, I use it with Nautilus). It is meant to work with window managers
  that are EWHM compliant. However, I only know for sure that it works with
  Metacity and Xfwm4. And I know that it doesn't work with Fluxbox and that it
  only partially works with Kwin (hopefully this will be corrected soon). I
  haven't yet tested it with other window managers.

Drawing icons for minimized windows on the desktop might be considered a step
  backwards by many people (hence the name), but I find it useful to identify
  minimized windows by position rather than by name.

1) Simple to use. You do not have to configure anything - just run 'backstep'.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
2) Session management support - at least to the extent that backstep adds itself
  to the session so that it will be started automatically the next time you log
  in to your desktop environment.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
3) Grouping. Windows can be grouped together (by right clicking on their icons
  and selecting a group) so that when one window from the group is shown or
  hidden, all windows in the group are shown or hidden.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
4) Configurable. You can make some adjustments to the way the icons look. This
  is done through a simple configuration dialog launched by right-clicking on an
  icon.
