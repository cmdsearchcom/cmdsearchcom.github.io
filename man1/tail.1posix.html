<p>TAIL(1POSIX) POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s Manual
TAIL(1POSIX)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROLOG <br>
This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s
Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of <br>
Linux behavior), or the interface may not be implemented on
Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
tail &acirc; copy the last part of a file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
tail [&acirc;f] [&acirc;c number|&acirc;n number] [file]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The tail utility shall copy its input file to the standard
output beginning at a designated place.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Copying shall begin at the point
in the file indicated by the &acirc;c number or &acirc;n
number options. The option-argument number shall be counted
in units of lines or bytes, according to <br>
the options &acirc;n and &acirc;c. Both line and byte counts
start from 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tails relative to the end of the
file may be saved in an internal buffer, and thus may be
limited in length. Such a buffer, if any, shall be no
smaller than {LINE_MAX}*10 bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The tail utility shall conform to the Base Definitions
volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax
Guidelines, except that &rsquo;+&rsquo; may be recognized as
an option delimiter <br>
as well as &rsquo;&acirc;&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options shall be
supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;c number The application
shall ensure that the number option-argument is a decimal
integer, optionally including a sign. The sign shall affect
the location in the file, mea&acirc; <br>
sured in bytes, to begin the copying:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&not;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;
<br>
&acirc;Sign &acirc; Copying Starts &acirc; <br>

&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&frac14;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&curren;
<br>
&acirc; + &acirc; Relative to the beginning of the file.
&acirc; <br>
&acirc; &acirc; &acirc; Relative to the end of the file.
&acirc; <br>
&acirc;none &acirc; Relative to the end of the file. &acirc;
<br>

&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acute;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;
<br>
The application shall ensure that if the sign of the number
option-argument is &rsquo;+&rsquo;, the number
option-argument is a non-zero decimal integer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The origin for counting shall be
1; that is, &acirc;c +1 represents the first byte of the
file, &acirc;c &acirc;1 the last.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;f If the input file is a
regular file or if the file operand specifies a FIFO, do not
terminate after the last line of the input file has been
copied, but read and copy <br>
further bytes from the input file when they become
available. If no file operand is specified and standard
input is a pipe or FIFO, the &acirc;f option shall be
ignored. If <br>
the input file is not a FIFO, pipe, or regular file, it is
unspecified whether or not the &acirc;f option shall be
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;n number This option
shall be equivalent to &acirc;c number, except the starting
location in the file shall be measured in lines instead of
bytes. The origin for counting shall be 1; <br>
that is, &acirc;n +1 represents the first line of the file,
&acirc;n &acirc;1 the last.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If neither &acirc;c nor &acirc;n
is specified, &acirc;n 10 shall be assumed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERANDS <br>
The following operand shall be supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file A pathname of an input
file. If no file operand is specified, the standard input
shall be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDIN <br>
The standard input shall be used if no file operand is
specified, and shall be used if the file operand is
&rsquo;&acirc;&rsquo; and the implementation treats the
&rsquo;&acirc;&rsquo; as meaning standard input. <br>
Otherwise, the standard input shall not be used. See the
INPUT FILES section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUT FILES <br>
If the &acirc;c option is specified, the input file can
contain arbitrary data; otherwise, the input file shall be a
text file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
The following environment variables shall affect the
execution of tail:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LANG Provide a default value for
the internationalization variables that are unset or null.
(See the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008,
Section 8.2, Internationaliza&acirc; <br>
tion Variables for the precedence of internationalization
variables used to determine the values of locale
categories.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_ALL If set to a non-empty
string value, override the values of all the other
internationalization variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_CTYPE Determine the locale
for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text data as
characters (for example, single-byte as opposed to
multi-byte characters in arguments <br>
and input files).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_MESSAGES <br>
Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
standard error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NLSPATH Determine the location
of message catalogs for the processing of LC_MESSAGES.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDOUT <br>
The designated portion of the input file shall be written to
standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDERR <br>
The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT FILES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTENDED DESCRIPTION <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The following exit values shall be returned:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 Successful completion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following sections are
informative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">APPLICATION USAGE <br>
The &acirc;c option should be used with caution when the
input is a text file containing multi-byte characters; it
may produce output that does not start on a character
boundary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Although the input file to tail
can be any type, the results might not be what would be
expected on some character special device files or on file
types not described by the Sys&acirc; <br>
tem Interfaces volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008. Since this
volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008 does not specify the block size
used when doing input, tail need not read all of the data
from devices <br>
that only perform block transfers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
The &acirc;f option can be used to monitor the growth of a
file that is being written by some other process. For
example, the command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tail &acirc;f fred</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">prints the last ten lines of the
file fred, followed by any lines that are appended to fred
between the time tail is initiated and killed. As another
example, the command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tail &acirc;f &acirc;c 15
fred</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">prints the last 15 bytes of the
file fred, followed by any bytes that are appended to fred
between the time tail is initiated and killed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RATIONALE <br>
This version of tail was created to allow conformance to the
Utility Syntax Guidelines. The historical &acirc;b option
was omitted because of the general non-portability of
block-sized <br>
units of text. The &acirc;c option historically meant
&lsquo;&lsquo;characters&rsquo;&rsquo;, but this volume of
POSIX.1&acirc;2008 indicates that it means
&lsquo;&lsquo;bytes&rsquo;&rsquo;. This was selected to
allow reasonable implemen&acirc; <br>
tations when multi-byte characters are possible; it was not
named &acirc;b to avoid confusion with the historical
&acirc;b.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The origin of counting both
lines and bytes is 1, matching all widespread historical
implementations. Hence tail &acirc;n +0 is not conforming
usage because it attempts to output line <br>
zero; but note that tail &acirc;n 0 does conform, and
outputs nothing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Earlier versions of this
standard allowed the following forms in the SYNOPSIS:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tail &acirc;[number][b|c|l][f]
[file] <br>
tail +[number][b|c|l][f] [file]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These forms are no longer
specified by POSIX.1&acirc;2008, but may be present in some
implementations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The restriction on the internal
buffer is a compromise between the historical System V
implementation of 4096 bytes and the BSD 32768 bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &acirc;f option has been
implemented as a loop that sleeps for 1 second and copies
any bytes that are available. This is sufficient, but if
more efficient methods of determining <br>
when new data are available are developed, implementations
are encouraged to use them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Historical documentation
indicates that tail ignores the &acirc;f option if the input
file is a pipe (pipe and FIFO on systems that support
FIFOs). On BSD-based systems, this has been <br>
true; on System V-based systems, this was true when input
was taken from standard input, but it did not ignore the
&acirc;f flag if a FIFO was named as the file operand. Since
the &acirc;f <br>
option is not useful on pipes and all historical
implementations ignore &acirc;f if no file operand is
specified and standard input is a pipe, this volume of
POSIX.1&acirc;2008 requires this <br>
behavior. However, since the &acirc;f option is useful on a
FIFO, this volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008 also requires that
if a FIFO is named, the &acirc;f option shall not be
ignored. Earlier ver&acirc; <br>
sions of this standard did not state any requirement for the
case where no file operand is specified and standard input
is a FIFO. The standard has been updated to reflect
cur&acirc; <br>
rent practice which is to treat this case the same as a pipe
on standard input. Although historical behavior does not
ignore the &acirc;f option for other file types, this is
unspeci&acirc; <br>
fied so that implementations are allowed to ignore the
&acirc;f option if it is known that the file cannot be
extended.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FUTURE DIRECTIONS <br>
None.</p>
