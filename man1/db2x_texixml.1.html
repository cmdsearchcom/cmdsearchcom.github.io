<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
db2x_texixml - Make Texinfo files from Texi-XML</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
db2x_texixml [options]... [xml-document]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
db2x_texixml converts a Texi-XML document into one or more
Texinfo documents.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If xml-document is not given,
then the document to convert comes from standard input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The filenames of the Texinfo
documents are determined by markup in the Texi-XML source.
(If the filenames are not specified in the markup, then
db2x_texixml attempts to deduce <br>
them from the name of the input file. However, the Texi-XML
source should specify the filename, because it does not work
when there are multiple output files or when the Texi-XML
<br>
source comes from standard input.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
--encoding=encoding <br>
Select the character encoding used for the output files. The
available encodings are those of iconv(1). The default
encoding is us-ascii.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The XML source may contain
characters that are not representable in the encoding that
you select; in this case the program will bomb out during
processing, and you should <br>
choose another encoding. (This is guaranteed not to happen
with any Unicode encoding such as UTF-8, but unfortunately
not everyone is able to process Unicode texts.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are using GNU&acirc;s
version of iconv(1), you can affix //TRANSLIT to the end of
the encoding name to attempt transliterations of any
unconvertible characters in the <br>
output. Beware, however, that the really inconvertible
characters will be turned into another of those damned
question marks. (Aren&acirc;t you sick of this?)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The suffix //TRANSLIT applied to
a Unicode encoding &acirc; in particular, utf-8//TRANSLIT
&acirc; means that the output files are to remain in
Unicode, but markup-level character <br>
translations using utf8trans are still to be done. So in
most cases, an English-language document, converted using
--encoding=utf-8//TRANSLIT will actually end up as a US-
<br>
ASCII document, but any untranslatable characters will
remain as UTF-8 without any warning whatsoever. (Note:
strictly speaking this is not
&acirc;transliteration&acirc;.) This <br>
method of conversion is a compromise over strict
--encoding=us-ascii processing, which aborts if any
untranslatable characters are encountered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that man pages and Texinfo
documents in non-ASCII encodings (including UTF-8) may not
be portable to older (non-internationalized) systems, which
is why the default <br>
value for this option is us-ascii.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To suppress any automatic
character mapping or encoding conversion whatsoever, pass
the option --encoding=utf-8.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--list-files <br>
Write a list of all the output files to standard output, in
addition to normal processing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--output-dir=dir <br>
Specify the directory where the output files are placed. The
default is the current working directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is ignored if the
output is to be written to standard output (triggered by the
option --to-stdout).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--to-stdout <br>
Write the output to standard output instead of to individual
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option is used even when
there are supposed to be multiple output documents, then
everything is concatenated to standard output. But beware
that most other pro&acirc; <br>
grams will not accept this concatenated output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is incompatible with
--list-files, obviously.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--info Pipe the Texinfo output
to makeinfo(1), creating Info files directly instead of
Texinfo files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--plaintext <br>
Pipe the Texinfo output to makeinfo --no-headers, thereby
creating plain text files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help Show brief usage
information and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Show version and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This program uses certain other
programs for its operation. If they are not in their default
installed locations, then use the following options to set
their location:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--utf8trans-program=path,
--utf8trans-map=charmap <br>
Use the character map charmap with the utf8trans(1) program,
included with docbook2X, found under path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--iconv-program=path <br>
The location of the iconv(1) program, used for encoding
conversions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
Texinfo language compatibility. The Texinfo files generated
by db2x_texixml sometimes require Texinfo version 4.7 (the
latest version) to work properly. In particular:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; db2x_texixml
relies on makeinfo to automatically add punctuation after a
@ref if it it not already there. Otherwise the hyperlink
will not work in the Info reader (although <br>
makeinfo will not emit any error).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The new @comma{}
command is used for commas (,) occurring inside argument
lists to Texinfo commands, to disambiguate it from the comma
used to separate different arguments. The <br>
only alternative otherwise would be to translate , to .
which is obviously undesirable (but earlier docbook2X
versions did this).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you cannot use version 4.7 of
makeinfo, you can still use a sed script to perform manually
the procedure just outlined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Relation of Texi-XML with the
XML output format of makeinfo. The Texi-XML format used by
docbook2X is different and incompatible with the XML format
generated by makeinfo(1) <br>
with its --xml option. This situation arose partly because
the Texi-XML format of docbook2X was designed and
implemented independently before the appearance of
makeinfo&acirc;s XML <br>
format. Also Texi-XML is very much geared towards being
machine-generated from other XML formats, while there seems
to be no non-trivial applications of makeinfo&acirc;s XML
format. <br>
So there is no reason at this point for docbook2X to adopt
makeinfo&acirc;s XML format in lieu of Texi-XML.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
&Acirc;&middot; Text wrapping in menus is utterly broken for
non-ASCII text. It is probably also broken everywhere else
in the output, but that would be makeinfo&acirc;s fault.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; --list-files
might not work correctly with --info. Specifically, when the
output Info file get too big, makeinfo will decide to split
it into parts named abc.info-1, abc.in&acirc; <br>
fo-2, abc.info-3, etc. db2x_texixml does not know exactly
how many of these files there are, though you can just do an
ls to find out.</p>
