<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
unzip - list, test and extract compressed files in a ZIP
archive</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
unzip [-Z] [-cflptTuvz[abjnoqsCDKLMUVWX$/:^]] file[.zip]
[file(s) ...] [-x xfile(s) ...] [-d exdir]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
unzip will list, test, or extract files from a ZIP archive,
commonly found on MS-DOS systems. The default behavior (with
no options) is to extract into the current directory <br>
(and subdirectories below it) all files from the specified
ZIP archive. A companion program, zip(1L), creates ZIP
archives; both programs are compatible with archives created
by <br>
PKWARE&rsquo;s PKZIP and PKUNZIP for MS-DOS, but in many
cases the program options or default behaviors differ.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ARGUMENTS <br>
file[.zip] <br>
Path of the ZIP archive(s). If the file specification is a
wildcard, each matching file is processed in an order
determined by the operating system (or file system). <br>
Only the filename can be a wildcard; the path itself cannot.
Wildcard expressions are similar to those supported in
commonly used Unix shells (sh, ksh, csh) and may con&acirc;
<br>
tain:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* matches a sequence of 0 or
more characters</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">? matches exactly 1
character</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[...] matches any single
character found inside the brackets; ranges are specified by
a beginning character, a hyphen, and an ending character. If
an exclamation point <br>
or a caret (&lsquo;!&rsquo; or &lsquo;^&rsquo;) follows the
left bracket, then the range of characters within the
brackets is complemented (that is, anything except the
characters inside <br>
the brackets is considered a match). To specify a verbatim
left bracket, the three-character sequence
&lsquo;&lsquo;[[]&rsquo;&rsquo; has to be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(Be sure to quote any character
that might otherwise be interpreted or modified by the
operating system, particularly under Unix and VMS.) If no
matches are found, the <br>
specification is assumed to be a literal filename; and if
that also fails, the suffix .zip is appended. Note that
self-extracting ZIP files are supported, as with any <br>
other ZIP archive; just specify the .exe suffix (if any)
explicitly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[file(s)] <br>
An optional list of archive members to be processed,
separated by spaces. (VMS versions compiled with VMSCLI
defined must delimit files with commas instead. See -v in
<br>
OPTIONS below.) Regular expressions (wildcards) may be used
to match multiple members; see above. Again, be sure to
quote expressions that would otherwise be expanded or <br>
modified by the operating system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[-x xfile(s)] <br>
An optional list of archive members to be excluded from
processing. Since wildcard characters normally match
(&lsquo;/&rsquo;) directory separators (for exceptions see
the option <br>
-W), this option may be used to exclude any files that are
in subdirectories. For example, &lsquo;&lsquo;unzip foo
*.[ch] -x */*&rsquo;&rsquo; would extract all C source files
in the main direc&acirc; <br>
tory, but none in any subdirectories. Without the -x option,
all C source files in all directories within the zipfile
would be extracted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[-d exdir] <br>
An optional directory to which to extract files. By default,
all files and subdirectories are recreated in the current
directory; the -d option allows extraction in an <br>
arbitrary directory (always assuming one has permission to
write to the directory). This option need not appear at the
end of the command line; it is also accepted before <br>
the zipfile specification (with the normal options),
immediately after the zipfile specification, or between the
file(s) and the -x option. The option and directory may <br>
be concatenated without any white space between them, but
note that this may cause normal shell behavior to be
suppressed. In particular, &lsquo;&lsquo;-d ~&rsquo;&rsquo;
(tilde) is expanded by <br>
Unix C shells into the name of the user&rsquo;s home
directory, but &lsquo;&lsquo;-d~&rsquo;&rsquo; is treated as
a literal subdirectory &lsquo;&lsquo;~&rsquo;&rsquo; of the
current directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Note that, in order to support obsolescent hardware,
unzip&rsquo;s usage screen is limited to 22 or 23 lines and
should therefore be considered only a reminder of the basic
unzip syn&acirc; <br>
tax rather than an exhaustive list of all possible flags.
The exhaustive list follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Z zipinfo(1L) mode. If the
first option on the command line is -Z, the remaining
options are taken to be zipinfo(1L) options. See the
appropriate manual page for a <br>
description of these options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A [OS/2, Unix DLL] print
extended help for the DLL&rsquo;s programming interface
(API).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c extract files to
stdout/screen (&lsquo;&lsquo;CRT&rsquo;&rsquo;). This option
is similar to the -p option except that the name of each
file is printed as it is extracted, the -a option is <br>
allowed, and ASCII-EBCDIC conversion is automatically
performed if appropriate. This option is not listed in the
unzip usage screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f freshen existing files, i.e.,
extract only those files that already exist on disk and that
are newer than the disk copies. By default unzip queries
before overwriting, <br>
but the -o option may be used to suppress the queries. Note
that under many operating systems, the TZ (timezone)
environment variable must be set correctly in order for <br>
-f and -u to work properly (under Unix the variable is
usually set automatically). The reasons for this are
somewhat subtle but have to do with the differences between
<br>
DOS-format file times (always local time) and Unix-format
times (always in GMT/UTC) and the necessity to compare the
two. A typical TZ value is
&lsquo;&lsquo;PST8PDT&rsquo;&rsquo; (US Pacific <br>
time with automatic adjustment for Daylight Savings Time or
&lsquo;&lsquo;summer time&rsquo;&rsquo;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l list archive files (short
format). The names, uncompressed file sizes and modification
dates and times of the specified files are printed, along
with totals for all files <br>
specified. If UnZip was compiled with OS2_EAS defined, the
-l option also lists columns for the sizes of stored OS/2
extended attributes (EAs) and OS/2 access control <br>
lists (ACLs). In addition, the zipfile comment and
individual file comments (if any) are displayed. If a file
was archived from a single-case file system (for example,
<br>
the old MS-DOS FAT file system) and the -L option was given,
the filename is converted to lowercase and is prefixed with
a caret (^).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p extract files to pipe
(stdout). Nothing but the file data is sent to stdout, and
the files are always extracted in binary format, just as
they are stored (no conver&acirc; <br>
sions).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t test archive files. This
option extracts each specified file in memory and compares
the CRC (cyclic redundancy check, an enhanced checksum) of
the expanded file with the <br>
original file&rsquo;s stored CRC value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T [most OSes] set the timestamp
on the archive(s) to that of the newest file in each one.
This corresponds to zip&rsquo;s -go option except that it
can be used on wildcard zip&acirc; <br>
files (e.g., &lsquo;&lsquo;unzip -T zip&rsquo;&rsquo;) and
is much faster.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u update existing files and
create new ones if needed. This option performs the same
function as the -f option, extracting (with query) files
that are newer than those with <br>
the same name on disk, and in addition it extracts those
files that do not already exist on disk. See -f above for
information on setting the timezone properly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v list archive files (verbose
format) or show diagnostic version info. This option has
evolved and now behaves as both an option and a modifier. As
an option it has two <br>
purposes: when a zipfile is specified with no other options,
-v lists archive files verbosely, adding to the basic -l
info the compression method, compressed size, com&acirc;
<br>
pression ratio and 32-bit CRC. In contrast to most of the
competing utilities, unzip removes the 12 additional header
bytes of encrypted entries from the compressed size <br>
numbers. Therefore, compressed size and compression ratio
figures are independent of the entry&rsquo;s encryption
status and show the correct compression performance. (The
<br>
complete size of the encrypted compressed data stream for
zipfile entries is reported by the more verbose zipinfo(1L)
reports, see the separate manual.) When no zipfile <br>
is specified (that is, the complete command is simply
&lsquo;&lsquo;unzip -v&rsquo;&rsquo;), a diagnostic screen
is printed. In addition to the normal header with release
date and version, unzip <br>
lists the home Info-ZIP ftp site and where to find a list of
other ftp and non-ftp sites; the target operating system for
which it was compiled, as well as (possibly) the <br>
hardware on which it was compiled, the compiler and version
used, and the compilation date; any special compilation
options that might affect the program&rsquo;s operation (see
<br>
also DECRYPTION below); and any options stored in
environment variables that might do the same (see
ENVIRONMENT OPTIONS below). As a modifier it works in
conjunction with <br>
other options (e.g., -t) to produce more verbose or
debugging output; this is not yet fully implemented but will
be in future releases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z display only the archive
comment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MODIFIERS <br>
-a convert text files. Ordinarily all files are extracted
exactly as they are stored (as
&lsquo;&lsquo;binary&rsquo;&rsquo; files). The -a option
causes files identified by zip as text files <br>
(those with the &lsquo;t&rsquo; label in zipinfo listings,
rather than &lsquo;b&rsquo;) to be automatically extracted
as such, converting line endings, end-of-file characters and
the character <br>
set itself as necessary. (For example, Unix files use line
feeds (LFs) for end-of-line (EOL) and have no end-of-file
(EOF) marker; Macintoshes use carriage returns (CRs) <br>
for EOLs; and most PC operating systems use CR+LF for EOLs
and control-Z for EOF. In addition, IBM mainframes and the
Michigan Terminal System use EBCDIC rather than the <br>
more common ASCII character set, and NT supports Unicode.)
Note that zip&rsquo;s identification of text files is by no
means perfect; some &lsquo;&lsquo;text&rsquo;&rsquo; files
may actually be binary <br>
and vice versa. unzip therefore prints
&lsquo;&lsquo;[text]&rsquo;&rsquo; or
&lsquo;&lsquo;[binary]&rsquo;&rsquo; as a visual check for
each file it extracts when using the -a option. The -aa
option forces all files <br>
to be extracted as text, regardless of the supposed file
type. On VMS, see also -S.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b [general] treat all files as
binary (no text conversions). This is a shortcut for
---a.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b [Tandem] force the creation
files with filecode type 180 (&rsquo;C&rsquo;) when
extracting Zip entries marked as &quot;text&quot;. (On
Tandem, -a is enabled by default, see above).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b [VMS] auto-convert binary
files (see -a above) to fixed-length, 512-byte record
format. Doubling the option (-bb) forces all files to be
extracted in this format. When <br>
extracting to standard output (-c or -p option in effect),
the default conversion of text record delimiters is disabled
for binary (-b) resp. all (-bb) files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B [when compiled with
UNIXBACKUP defined] save a backup copy of each overwritten
file. The backup file is gets the name of the target file
with a tilde and optionally a <br>
unique sequence number (up to 5 digits) appended. The
sequence number is applied whenever another file with the
original name plus tilde already exists. When used <br>
together with the &quot;overwrite all&quot; option -o,
numbered backup files are never created. In this case, all
backup files are named as the original file with an appended
tilde, <br>
existing backup files are deleted without notice. This
feature works similarly to the default behavior of emacs(1)
in many locations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example: the old copy of
&lsquo;&lsquo;foo&rsquo;&rsquo; is renamed to
&lsquo;&lsquo;foo~&rsquo;&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning: Users should be aware
that the -B option does not prevent loss of existing data
under all circumstances. For example, when unzip is run in
overwrite-all mode, an <br>
existing &lsquo;&lsquo;foo~&rsquo;&rsquo; file is deleted
before unzip attempts to rename
&lsquo;&lsquo;foo&rsquo;&rsquo; to
&lsquo;&lsquo;foo~&rsquo;&rsquo;. When this rename attempt
fails (because of a file locks, insufficient privileges,
<br>
or ...), the extraction of &lsquo;&lsquo;foo~&rsquo;&rsquo;
gets cancelled, but the old backup file is already lost. A
similar scenario takes place when the sequence number range
for numbered <br>
backup files gets exhausted (99999, or 65535 for 16-bit
systems). In this case, the backup file with the maximum
sequence number is deleted and replaced by the new backup
<br>
version without notice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C use case-insensitive matching
for the selection of archive entries from the command-line
list of extract selection patterns. unzip&rsquo;s philosophy
is &lsquo;&lsquo;you get what you ask <br>
for&rsquo;&rsquo; (this is also responsible for the -L/-U
change; see the relevant options below). Because some file
systems are fully case-sensitive (notably those under the
Unix <br>
operating system) and because both ZIP archives and unzip
itself are portable across platforms, unzip&rsquo;s default
behavior is to match both wildcard and literal filenames
<br>
case-sensitively. That is, specifying
&lsquo;&lsquo;makefile&rsquo;&rsquo; on the command line
will only match &lsquo;&lsquo;makefile&rsquo;&rsquo; in the
archive, not &lsquo;&lsquo;Makefile&rsquo;&rsquo; or
&lsquo;&lsquo;MAKEFILE&rsquo;&rsquo; (and similarly for <br>
wildcard specifications). Since this does not correspond to
the behavior of many other operating/file systems (for
example, OS/2 HPFS, which preserves mixed case but is <br>
not sensitive to it), the -C option may be used to force all
filename matches to be case-insensitive. In the example
above, all three files would then match
&lsquo;&lsquo;makefile&rsquo;&rsquo; <br>
(or &lsquo;&lsquo;make*&rsquo;&rsquo;, or similar). The -C
option affects file specs in both the normal file list and
the excluded-file list (xlist).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please note that the -C option
does neither affect the search for the zipfile(s) nor the
matching of archive entries to existing files on the
extraction path. On a case- <br>
sensitive file system, unzip will never try to overwrite a
file &lsquo;&lsquo;FOO&rsquo;&rsquo; when extracting an
entry &lsquo;&lsquo;foo&rsquo;&rsquo;!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D skip restoration of
timestamps for extracted items. Normally, unzip tries to
restore all meta-information for extracted items that are
supplied in the Zip archive (and do <br>
not require privileges or impose a security risk). By
specifying -D, unzip is told to suppress restoration of
timestamps for directories explicitly created from Zip
ar&acirc; <br>
chive entries. This option only applies to ports that
support setting timestamps for directories (currently
ATheOS, BeOS, MacOS, OS/2, Unix, VMS, Win32, for other unzip
<br>
ports, -D has no effect). The duplicated option -DD forces
suppression of timestamp restoration for all extracted
entries (files and directories). This option results in <br>
setting the timestamps for all extracted entries to the
current time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On VMS, the default setting for
this option is -D for consistency with the behaviour of
BACKUP: file timestamps are restored, timestamps of
extracted directories are left <br>
at the current time. To enable restoration of directory
timestamps, the negated option --D should be specified. On
VMS, the option -D disables timestamp restoration for <br>
all extracted Zip archive items. (Here, a single -D on the
command line combines with the default -D to do what an
explicit -DD does on other systems.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E [MacOS only] display contents
of MacOS extra field during restore operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F [Acorn only] suppress removal
of NFS filetype extension from stored filenames.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F [non-Acorn systems supporting
long filenames with embedded commas, and only if compiled
with ACORN_FTYPE_NFS defined] translate filetype information
from ACORN RISC OS <br>
extra field blocks into a NFS filetype extension and append
it to the names of the extracted files. (When the stored
filename appears to already have an appended NFS <br>
filetype extension, it is replaced by the info from the
extra field.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i [MacOS only] ignore filenames
stored in MacOS extra fields. Instead, the most compatible
filename stored in the generic part of the entry&rsquo;s
header is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-j junk paths. The
archive&rsquo;s directory structure is not recreated; all
files are deposited in the extraction directory (by default,
the current one).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-J [BeOS only] junk file
attributes. The file&rsquo;s BeOS file attributes are not
restored, just the file&rsquo;s data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-J [MacOS only] ignore MacOS
extra fields. All Macintosh specific info is skipped.
Data-fork and resource-fork are restored as separate
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-K [AtheOS, BeOS, Unix only]
retain SUID/SGID/Tacky file attributes. Without this flag,
these attribute bits are cleared for security reasons.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L convert to lowercase any
filename originating on an uppercase-only operating system
or file system. (This was unzip&rsquo;s default behavior in
releases prior to 5.11; the new <br>
default behavior is identical to the old behavior with the
-U option, which is now obsolete and will be removed in a
future release.) Depending on the archiver, files <br>
archived under single-case file systems (VMS, old MS-DOS
FAT, etc.) may be stored as all-uppercase names; this can be
ugly or inconvenient when extracting to a case-pre&acirc;
<br>
serving file system such as OS/2 HPFS or a case-sensitive
one such as under Unix. By default unzip lists and extracts
such filenames exactly as they&rsquo;re stored (excepting
<br>
truncation, conversion of unsupported characters, etc.);
this option causes the names of all files from certain
systems to be converted to lowercase. The -LL option <br>
forces conversion of every filename to lowercase, regardless
of the originating file system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M pipe all output through an
internal pager similar to the Unix more(1) command. At the
end of a screenful of output, unzip pauses with a
&lsquo;&lsquo;--More--&rsquo;&rsquo; prompt; the next <br>
screenful may be viewed by pressing the Enter (Return) key
or the space bar. unzip can be terminated by pressing the
&lsquo;&lsquo;q&rsquo;&rsquo; key and, on some systems, the
Enter/Return key. <br>
Unlike Unix more(1), there is no forward-searching or
editing capability. Also, unzip doesn&rsquo;t notice if long
lines wrap at the edge of the screen, effectively resulting
<br>
in the printing of two or more lines and the likelihood that
some text will scroll off the top of the screen before being
viewed. On some systems the number of available <br>
lines on the screen is not detected, in which case unzip
assumes the height is 24 lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n never overwrite existing
files. If a file already exists, skip the extraction of that
file without prompting. By default unzip queries before
extracting any file that <br>
already exists; the user may choose to overwrite only the
current file, overwrite all files, skip extraction of the
current file, skip extraction of all existing files, or <br>
rename the current file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N [Amiga] extract file comments
as Amiga filenotes. File comments are created with the -c
option of zip(1L), or with the -N option of the Amiga port
of zip(1L), which <br>
stores filenotes as comments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o overwrite existing files
without prompting. This is a dangerous option, so use it
with care. (It is often used with -f, however, and is the
only way to overwrite direc&acirc; <br>
tory EAs under OS/2.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P password <br>
use password to decrypt encrypted zipfile entries (if any).
THIS IS INSECURE! Many multi-user operating systems provide
ways for any user to see the current command line <br>
of any other user; even on stand-alone systems there is
always the threat of over-the-shoulder peeking. Storing the
plaintext password as part of a command line in an <br>
automated script is even worse. Whenever possible, use the
non-echoing, interactive prompt to enter passwords. (And
where security is truly important, use strong encryp&acirc;
<br>
tion such as Pretty Good Privacy instead of the relatively
weak encryption provided by standard zipfile utilities.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q perform operations quietly
(-qq = even quieter). Ordinarily unzip prints the names of
the files it&rsquo;s extracting or testing, the extraction
methods, any file or zipfile <br>
comments that may be stored in the archive, and possibly a
summary when finished with each archive. The -q[q] options
suppress the printing of some or all of these mes&acirc;
<br>
sages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s [OS/2, NT, MS-DOS] convert
spaces in filenames to underscores. Since all PC operating
systems allow spaces in filenames, unzip by default extracts
filenames with spaces <br>
intact (e.g., &lsquo;&lsquo;EA DATA. SF&rsquo;&rsquo;). This
can be awkward, however, since MS-DOS in particular does not
gracefully support spaces in filenames. Conversion of spaces
to under&acirc; <br>
scores can eliminate the awkwardness in some cases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S [VMS] convert text files (-a,
-aa) into Stream_LF record format, instead of the text-file
default, variable-length record format. (Stream_LF is the
default record format <br>
of VMS unzip. It is applied unless conversion (-a, -aa
and/or -b, -bb) is requested or a VMS-specific entry is
processed.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U [UNICODE_SUPPORT only] modify
or disable UTF-8 handling. When UNICODE_SUPPORT is
available, the option -U forces unzip to escape all
non-ASCII characters from UTF-8 coded <br>
filenames as &lsquo;&lsquo;#Uxxxx&rsquo;&rsquo; (for UCS-2
characters, or &lsquo;&lsquo;#Lxxxxxx&rsquo;&rsquo; for
unicode codepoints needing 3 octets). This option is mainly
provided for debugging purpose when the <br>
fairly new UTF-8 support is suspected to mangle up extracted
filenames.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The option -UU allows to
entirely disable the recognition of UTF-8 encoded filenames.
The handling of filename codings within unzip falls back to
the behaviour of previ&acirc; <br>
ous versions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[old, obsolete usage] leave
filenames uppercase if created under MS-DOS, VMS, etc. See
-L above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V retain (VMS) file version
numbers. VMS files can be stored with a version number, in
the format file.ext;##. By default the
&lsquo;&lsquo;;##&rsquo;&rsquo; version numbers are
stripped, but <br>
this option allows them to be retained. (On file systems
that limit filenames to particularly short lengths, the
version numbers may be truncated or stripped regardless <br>
of this option.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-W [only when WILD_STOP_AT_DIR
compile-time option enabled] modifies the pattern matching
routine so that both &lsquo;?&rsquo; (single-char wildcard)
and &lsquo;*&rsquo; (multi-char wildcard) do not <br>
match the directory separator character &lsquo;/&rsquo;.
(The two-character sequence &lsquo;&lsquo;**&rsquo;&rsquo;
acts as a multi-char wildcard that includes the directory
separator in its matched charac&acirc; <br>
ters.) Examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;*.c&quot; matches
&quot;foo.c&quot; but not &quot;mydir/foo.c&quot; <br>
&quot;**.c&quot; matches both &quot;foo.c&quot; and
&quot;mydir/foo.c&quot; <br>
&quot;*/*.c&quot; matches &quot;bar/foo.c&quot; but not
&quot;baz/bar/foo.c&quot; <br>
&quot;??*/*&quot; matches &quot;ab/foo&quot; and
&quot;abc/foo&quot; <br>
but not &quot;a/foo&quot; or &quot;a/b/foo&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This modified behaviour is
equivalent to the pattern matching style used by the shells
of some of UnZip&rsquo;s supported target OSs (one example
is Acorn RISC OS). This option <br>
may not be available on systems where the Zip
archive&rsquo;s internal directory separator character
&lsquo;/&rsquo; is allowed as regular character in native
operating system filenames. <br>
(Currently, UnZip uses the same pattern matching rules for
both wildcard zipfile specifications and zip entry selection
patterns in most ports. For systems allowing &lsquo;/&rsquo;
<br>
as regular filename character, the -W option would not work
as expected on a wildcard zipfile specification.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X [VMS, Unix, OS/2, NT, Tandem]
restore owner/protection info (UICs and ACL entries) under
VMS, or user and group info (UID/GID) under Unix, or access
control lists (ACLs) <br>
under certain network-enabled versions of OS/2 (Warp Server
with IBM LAN Server/Requester 3.0 to 5.0; Warp Connect with
IBM Peer 1.0), or security ACLs under Windows NT. <br>
In most cases this will require special system privileges,
and doubling the option (-XX) under NT instructs unzip to
use privileges for extraction; but under Unix, for <br>
example, a user who belongs to several groups can restore
files owned by any of those groups, as long as the user IDs
match his or her own. Note that ordinary file <br>
attributes are always restored--this option applies only to
optional, extra ownership info available on some operating
systems. [NT&rsquo;s access control lists do not appear <br>
to be especially compatible with OS/2&rsquo;s, so no attempt
is made at cross-platform portability of access privileges.
It is not clear under what conditions this would ever <br>
be useful anyway.]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Y [VMS] treat archived file
name endings of &lsquo;&lsquo;.nnn&rsquo;&rsquo; (where
&lsquo;&lsquo;nnn&rsquo;&rsquo; is a decimal number) as if
they were VMS version numbers
(&lsquo;&lsquo;;nnn&rsquo;&rsquo;). (The default is to treat
them as <br>
file types.) Example: <br>
&quot;a.b.3&quot; -&gt; &quot;a.b;3&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-$ [MS-DOS, OS/2, NT] restore
the volume label if the extraction medium is removable
(e.g., a diskette). Doubling the option (-$$) allows fixed
media (hard disks) to be <br>
labeled as well. By default, volume labels are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-/ extensions <br>
[Acorn only] overrides the extension list supplied by
Unzip$Ext environment variable. During extraction, filename
extensions that match one of the items in this extension
<br>
list are swapped in front of the base name of the extracted
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-: [all but Acorn, VM/CMS, MVS,
Tandem] allows to extract archive members into locations
outside of the current &lsquo;&lsquo; extraction root
folder&rsquo;&rsquo;. For security reasons, unzip nor&acirc;
<br>
mally removes &lsquo;&lsquo;parent dir&rsquo;&rsquo; path
components (&lsquo;&lsquo;../&rsquo;&rsquo;) from the names
of extracted file. This safety feature (new for version
5.50) prevents unzip from accidentally writ&acirc; <br>
ing files to &lsquo;&lsquo;sensitive&rsquo;&rsquo; areas
outside the active extraction folder tree head. The -:
option lets unzip switch back to its previous, more liberal
behaviour, to allow <br>
exact extraction of (older) archives that used
&lsquo;&lsquo;../&rsquo;&rsquo; components to create
multiple directory trees at the level of the current
extraction folder. This option does not <br>
enable writing explicitly to the root directory
(&lsquo;&lsquo;/&rsquo;&rsquo;). To achieve this, it is
necessary to set the extraction target folder to root (e.g.
-d / ). However, when the -: <br>
option is specified, it is still possible to implicitly
write to the root directory by specifying enough
&lsquo;&lsquo;../&rsquo;&rsquo; path components within the
zip archive. Use this option <br>
with extreme caution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-^ [Unix only] allow control
characters in names of extracted ZIP archive entries. On
Unix, a file name may contain any (8-bit) character code
with the two exception &rsquo;/&rsquo; <br>
(directory delimiter) and NUL (0x00, the C string
termination indicator), unless the specific file system has
more restrictive conventions. Generally, this allows to <br>
embed ASCII control characters (or even sophisticated
control sequences) in file names, at least on
&rsquo;native&rsquo; Unix file systems. However, it may be
highly suspicious to <br>
make use of this Unix &quot;feature&quot;. Embedded control
characters in file names might have nasty side effects when
displayed on screen by some listing code without sufficient
<br>
filtering. And, for ordinary users, it may be difficult to
handle such file names (e.g. when trying to specify it for
open, copy, move, or delete operations). Therefore, <br>
unzip applies a filter by default that removes potentially
dangerous control characters from the extracted file names.
The -^ option allows to override this filter in the <br>
rare case that embedded filename control characters are to
be intentionally restored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-2 [VMS] force unconditionally
conversion of file names to ODS2-compatible names. The
default is to exploit the destination file system,
preserving case and extended file <br>
name characters on an ODS5 destination file system; and
applying the ODS2-compatibility file name filtering on an
ODS2 destination file system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT OPTIONS <br>
unzip&rsquo;s default behavior may be modified via options
placed in an environment variable. This can be done with any
option, but it is probably most useful with the -a, -L, -C,
-q, <br>
-o, or -n modifiers: make unzip auto-convert text files by
default, make it convert filenames from uppercase systems to
lowercase, make it match names case-insensitively, make <br>
it quieter, or make it always overwrite or never overwrite
files as it extracts them. For example, to make unzip act as
quietly as possible, only reporting errors, one would use
<br>
one of the following commands:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unix Bourne shell: <br>
UNZIP=-qq; export UNZIP</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unix C shell: <br>
setenv UNZIP -qq</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OS/2 or MS-DOS: <br>
set UNZIP=-qq</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VMS (quotes for lowercase): <br>
define UNZIP_OPTS &quot;-qq&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Environment options are, in
effect, considered to be just like any other command-line
options, except that they are effectively the first options
on the command line. To over&acirc; <br>
ride an environment option, one may use the
&lsquo;&lsquo;minus operator&rsquo;&rsquo; to remove it. For
instance, to override one of the quiet-flags in the example
above, use the command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unzip --q[other options]
zipfile</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first hyphen is the normal
switch character, and the second is a minus sign, acting on
the q option. Thus the effect here is to cancel one quantum
of quietness. To cancel <br>
both quiet flags, two (or more) minuses may be used:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unzip -t--q zipfile <br>
unzip ---qt zipfile</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(the two are equivalent). This
may seem awkward or confusing, but it is reasonably
intuitive: just ignore the first hyphen and go from there.
It is also consistent with the <br>
behavior of Unix nice(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As suggested by the examples
above, the default variable names are UNZIP_OPTS for VMS
(where the symbol used to install unzip as a foreign command
would otherwise be confused <br>
with the environment variable), and UNZIP for all other
operating systems. For compatibility with zip(1L), UNZIPOPT
is also accepted (don&rsquo;t ask). If both UNZIP and
UNZIPOPT are <br>
defined, however, UNZIP takes precedence. unzip&rsquo;s
diagnostic option (-v with no zipfile name) can be used to
check the values of all four possible unzip and zipinfo
environment <br>
variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The timezone variable (TZ)
should be set according to the local timezone in order for
the -f and -u to operate correctly. See the description of
-f above for details. This <br>
variable may also be necessary to get timestamps of
extracted files to be set correctly. The WIN32
(Win9x/ME/NT4/2K/XP/2K3) port of unzip gets the timezone
configuration from <br>
the registry, assuming it is correctly set in the Control
Panel. The TZ variable is ignored for this port.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DECRYPTION <br>
Encrypted archives are fully supported by Info-ZIP software,
but due to United States export restrictions, de-/encryption
support might be disabled in your compiled binary.
How&acirc; <br>
ever, since spring 2000, US export restrictions have been
liberated, and our source archives do now include full crypt
code. In case you need binary distributions with crypt <br>
support enabled, see the file
&lsquo;&lsquo;WHERE&rsquo;&rsquo; in any Info-ZIP source or
binary distribution for locations both inside and outside
the US.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some compiled versions of unzip
may not support decryption. To check a version for crypt
support, either attempt to test or extract an encrypted
archive, or else check unzip&rsquo;s <br>
diagnostic screen (see the -v option above) for
&lsquo;&lsquo;[decryption]&rsquo;&rsquo; as one of the
special compilation options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As noted above, the -P option
may be used to supply a password on the command line, but at
a cost in security. The preferred decryption method is
simply to extract normally; if <br>
a zipfile member is encrypted, unzip will prompt for the
password without echoing what is typed. unzip continues to
use the same password as long as it appears to be valid, by
<br>
testing a 12-byte header on each file. The correct password
will always check out against the header, but there is a
1-in-256 chance that an incorrect password will as well.
<br>
(This is a security feature of the PKWARE zipfile format; it
helps prevent brute-force attacks that might otherwise gain
a large speed advantage by testing only the header.) In <br>
the case that an incorrect password is given but it passes
the header test anyway, either an incorrect CRC will be
generated for the extracted data or else unzip will fail
during <br>
the extraction because the
&lsquo;&lsquo;decrypted&rsquo;&rsquo; bytes do not
constitute a valid compressed data stream.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the first password fails the
header check on some file, unzip will prompt for another
password, and so on until all files are extracted. If a
password is not known, entering <br>
a null password (that is, just a carriage return or
&lsquo;&lsquo;Enter&rsquo;&rsquo;) is taken as a signal to
skip all further prompting. Only unencrypted files in the
archive(s) will thereafter be <br>
extracted. (In fact, that&rsquo;s not quite true; older
versions of zip(1L) and zipcloak(1L) allowed null passwords,
so unzip checks each encrypted file to see if the null
password <br>
works. This may result in &lsquo;&lsquo;false
positives&rsquo;&rsquo; and extraction errors, as noted
above.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Archives encrypted with 8-bit
passwords (for example, passwords with accented European
characters) may not be portable across systems and/or other
archivers. This problem stems <br>
from the use of multiple encoding methods for such
characters, including Latin-1 (ISO 8859-1) and OEM code page
850. DOS PKZIP 2.04g uses the OEM code page; Windows PKZIP
2.50 <br>
uses Latin-1 (and is therefore incompatible with DOS PKZIP);
Info-ZIP uses the OEM code page on DOS, OS/2 and Win3.x
ports but ISO coding (Latin-1 etc.) everywhere else; and
Nico <br>
Mak&rsquo;s WinZip 6.x does not allow 8-bit passwords at
all. UnZip 5.3 (or newer) attempts to use the default
character set first (e.g., Latin-1), followed by the
alternate one <br>
(e.g., OEM code page) to test passwords. On EBCDIC systems,
if both of these fail, EBCDIC encoding will be tested as a
last resort. (EBCDIC is not tested on non-EBCDIC systems,
<br>
because there are no known archivers that encrypt using
EBCDIC encoding.) ISO character encodings other than Latin-1
are not supported. The new addition of (partially) Unicode
<br>
(resp. UTF-8) support in UnZip 6.0 has not yet been adapted
to the encryption password handling in unzip. On systems
that use UTF-8 as native character encoding, unzip simply
<br>
tries decryption with the native UTF-8 encoded password; the
built-in attempts to check the password in translated
encoding have not yet been adapted for UTF-8 support and
will <br>
consequently fail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
To use unzip to extract all members of the archive
letters.zip into the current directory and subdirectories
below it, creating any subdirectories as necessary:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unzip letters</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To extract all members of
letters.zip into the current directory only:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unzip -j letters</p>

only a summary message indicating whether the archive is OK
or not:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unzip -tq letters</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To test all zipfiles in the
current directory, printing only the summaries:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unzip -tq zip</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(The backslash before the

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TIPS <br>
The current maintainer, being a lazy sort, finds it very
useful to define a pair of aliases: tt for
&lsquo;&lsquo;unzip -tq&rsquo;&rsquo; and ii for
&lsquo;&lsquo;unzip -Z&rsquo;&rsquo; (or
&lsquo;&lsquo;zipinfo&rsquo;&rsquo;). One may then simply
<br>
type &lsquo;&lsquo;tt zipfile&rsquo;&rsquo; to test an
archive, something that is worth making a habit of doing.
With luck unzip will report &lsquo;&lsquo;No errors detected
in compressed data of zipfile.zip,&rsquo;&rsquo; <br>
after which one may breathe a sigh of relief.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The maintainer also finds it
useful to set the UNZIP environment variable to
&lsquo;&lsquo;-aL&rsquo;&rsquo; and is tempted to add
&lsquo;&lsquo;-C&rsquo;&rsquo; as well. His ZIPINFO variable
is set to &lsquo;&lsquo;-z&rsquo;&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
The exit status (or error level) approximates the exit codes
defined by PKWARE and takes on the following values, except
under VMS:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 normal; no errors or warnings
detected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 one or more warning errors
were encountered, but processing completed successfully
anyway. This includes zipfiles where one or more files was
skipped due to unsup&acirc; <br>
ported compression method or encryption with an unknown
password.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 a generic error in the zipfile
format was detected. Processing may have completed
successfully anyway; some broken zipfiles created by other
archivers have simple <br>
work-arounds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3 a severe error in the zipfile
format was detected. Processing probably failed
immediately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4 unzip was unable to allocate
memory for one or more buffers during program
initialization.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5 unzip was unable to allocate
memory or unable to obtain a tty to read the decryption
password(s).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6 unzip was unable to allocate
memory during decompression to disk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">7 unzip was unable to allocate
memory during in-memory decompression.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">8 [currently not used]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">9 the specified zipfiles were
not found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">10 invalid options were
specified on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">11 no matching files were
found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">50 the disk is (or was) full
during extraction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">51 the end of the ZIP archive
was encountered prematurely.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">80 the user aborted unzip
prematurely with control-C (or similar)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">81 testing or extraction of one
or more files failed due to unsupported compression methods
or unsupported decryption.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">82 no files were found due to
bad decryption password(s). (If even one file is
successfully processed, however, the exit status is 1.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VMS interprets standard Unix (or
PC) return values as other, scarier-looking things, so unzip
instead maps them into VMS-style status codes. The current
mapping is as follows: <br>
1 (success) for normal exit, 0x7fff0001 for warning errors,
and (0x7fff000? + 16*normal_unzip_exit_status) for all other
errors, where the &lsquo;?&rsquo; is 2 (error) for unzip
values 2, <br>
9-11 and 80-82, and 4 (fatal error) for the remaining ones
(3-8, 50, 51). In addition, there is a compilation option to
expand upon this behavior: defining RETURN_CODES results
<br>
in a human-readable explanation of what the error status
means.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Multi-part archives are not yet supported, except in
conjunction with zip. (All parts must be concatenated
together in order, and then &lsquo;&lsquo;zip
-F&rsquo;&rsquo; (for zip 2.x) or &lsquo;&lsquo;zip
-FF&rsquo;&rsquo; <br>
(for zip 3.x) must be performed on the concatenated archive
in order to &lsquo;&lsquo;fix&rsquo;&rsquo; it. Also, zip
3.0 and later can combine multi-part (split) archives into a
combined single-file <br>
archive using &lsquo;&lsquo;zip -s- inarchive -O
outarchive&rsquo;&rsquo;. See the zip 3 manual page for more
information.) This will definitely be corrected in the next
major release.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Archives read from standard
input are not yet supported, except with funzip (and then
only the first member of the archive can be extracted).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Archives encrypted with 8-bit
passwords (e.g., passwords with accented European
characters) may not be portable across systems and/or other
archivers. See the discussion in <br>
DECRYPTION above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unzip&rsquo;s -M
(&lsquo;&lsquo;more&rsquo;&rsquo;) option tries to take into
account automatic wrapping of long lines. However, the code
may fail to detect the correct wrapping locations. First,
TAB charac&acirc; <br>
ters (and similar control sequences) are not taken into
account, they are handled as ordinary printable characters.
Second, depending on the actual system / OS port, unzip may
<br>
not detect the true screen geometry but rather rely on
&quot;commonly used&quot; default dimensions. The correct
handling of tabs would require the implementation of a query
for the <br>
actual tabulator setup on the output console.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Dates, times and permissions of
stored directories are not restored except under Unix. (On
Windows NT and successors, timestamps are now restored.)</p>

sions of unzip may hang the system, requiring a reboot. This
problem appears to be fixed, but control-C (or
control-Break) can still be used to terminate unzip.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Under DEC Ultrix, unzip would
sometimes fail on long zipfiles (bad CRC, not always
reproducible). This was apparently due either to a hardware
bug (cache memory) or an operating <br>
system bug (improper handling of page faults?). Since Ultrix
has been abandoned in favor of Digital Unix (OSF/1), this
may not be an issue anymore.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[Unix] Unix special files such
as FIFO buffers (named pipes), block devices and character

symbolic (soft) links.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[OS/2] Extended attributes for
existing directories are only updated if the -o

has no way to determine whether the stored attributes are
newer or older than those on disk. In practice this may <br>
mean a two-pass approach is required: first unpack the
archive normally (with or without freshening/updating
existing files), then overwrite just the directory entries
(e.g., <br>
&lsquo;&lsquo;unzip -o foo */&rsquo;&rsquo;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[VMS] When extracting to another
