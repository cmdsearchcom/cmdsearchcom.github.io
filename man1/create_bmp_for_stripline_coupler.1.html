<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
create_bmp_for_stripline_coupler - bitmap generator for
coupler with thin striplines between two infinitely wide
groundplanes (part of atlc)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
create_bmp_for_stripline_coupler [-C] [-b bitmapsize] [-v] H
w s Er outputfile</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WARNING <br>
This man page is not a complete set of documentation - the
complexity of the atlc project makes man pages not an ideal
way to document it, although out of completeness, man pages
<br>
are produced. The best documentation that was current at the
time the version was produced should be found on your hard
drive, usually at <br>
/usr/local/share/atlc/docs/html-docs/index.html <br>
although it might be elsewhere if your system administrator
chose to install the package elsewhere. Sometimes, errors
are corrected in the documentation and placed at <br>
http://atlc.sourceforge.net/ before a new release of atlc is
released. Please, if you notice a problem with the
documentation - even spelling errors and typos, please let
me <br>
know.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
create_bmp_for_stripline_coupler is a pre-processor for
atlc, the finite difference program that is used to
calculate the properties of a two and three conductor
electrical <br>
transmission lines of arbitrary cross section. The program
create_bmp_for_stripline_coupler is used as a fast way of
generating bitmaps (there is no need to use a graphics
pro&acirc; <br>
gram), for a pair of 1 pixel thick conductors of width w,
spaced a distance s apart, inside a pair of groundplanes of
separation H. This has an exact analytical answer, when the
<br>
inner is infinitely thin and the overall width W is
infinitely wide. This theoretical impedance is calculated
and printed to stderr if the -v option is given on
cre&acirc; <br>
ate_bmp_for_stripline_coupler&rsquo;s command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The overall width W is
calculated internally to be large enough that making it any
larger will have negligible effect on the results. The
dielectric is assumed that of vacuum.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The bitmaps produced by
create_bmp_for_stripline_coupler are 24-bit bit colour
bitmaps, as are required by atlc.</p>

Print the full copyright information and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b bitmapsize <br>
is used to set the size of the bitmap, and so the accuracy
to which atlc is able to calculate the coupler&rsquo;s
properties. The default value for &rsquo;bitmapsize&rsquo;
is normally 18 although <br>
this can be set at compile time. (see
&rsquo;DEFAULT_COUPLER_BITMAP_SIZE&rsquo; in definitions.h).
The value can be set anywhere from 6 to 28. The size of
bitmap produced will be between <br>
2^(bitmapsize-1) and 2^(bitmapsize+1), so if its set to 28
the bitmap could be as big as 512 Mb, which would take an
eternity to compute.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v <br>
Print some extra data to stdout on the theoretical impedance
of the structure. This is useful to compare with the
numerical result from atlc</p>
