<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
mmv - move/copy/append/link multiple files by wildcard
patterns</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
mmv [-m|x|r|c|o|a|l|s] [-h] [-d|p] [-g|t] [-v|n] [--] [from
to]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Rename all *.jpeg files in the current directory to
*.jpg:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mmv &rsquo;*.jpeg&rsquo;
&rsquo;#1.jpg&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Replace the first occurrence of
abc with xyz in all files in the current directory:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mmv &rsquo;*abc*&rsquo;
&rsquo;#1xyz#2&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Rename files ending in .html.en,
.html.de, etc. to ending in .en.html, .de.html, etc. in the
current directory:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mmv &rsquo;*.html.??&rsquo;
&rsquo;#1.#2#3.html&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Rename music files from
&lt;track no.&gt; - &lt;interpreter&gt; - &lt;song
title&gt;.ogg to &lt;interpreter&gt; - &lt;track no.&gt; -
&lt;song title&gt;.ogg in the current directory:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mmv &rsquo;* - * - *.ogg&rsquo;
&rsquo;#2 - #1 - #3.ogg&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Mmv moves (or copies, appends, or links, as specified) each
source file matching a from pattern to the target name
specified by the to pattern. This multiple action is
performed <br>
safely, i.e. without any unexpected deletion of files due to
collisions of target names with existing filenames or with
other target names. Furthermore, before doing anything, <br>
mmv attempts to detect any errors that would result from the
entire set of actions specified and gives the user the
choice of either proceeding by avoiding the offending parts
or <br>
aborting. mmv does support large files (LFS) but it does
*NOT* support sparse files (i.e. it explodes them).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Task Options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Whether mmv moves, copies,
appends, or links is governed by the first set of options
given above. If none of these are specified, the task is
given by the command name under <br>
which mmv was invoked (argv[0]):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">command name default task</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mmv -x <br>
mcp -c <br>
mad -a <br>
mln -l</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The task option choices are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m : move source file to target
name. Both must be on the same device. Will not move
directories. If the source file is a symbolic link, moves
the link without checking if <br>
the link&rsquo;s target from the new directory is different
than the old.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x : same as -m, except
cross-device moves are done by copying, then deleting
source. When copying, sets the permission bits and file
modification time of the target file to <br>
that of the source file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r : rename source file or
directory to target name. The target name must not include a
path: the file remains in the same directory in all cases.
This option is the only way <br>
of renaming directories under mmv.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c : copy source file to target
name. Sets the file modification time and permission bits of
the target file to that of the source file, regardless of
whether the target file <br>
already exists. Chains and cycles (to be explained below)
are not allowed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o : overwrite target name with
source file. If target file exists, it is overwritten,
keeping its original owner and permission bits. If it does
not exist, it is created, <br>
with read-write permission bits set according to umask(1),
and the execute permission bits copied from the source file.
In either case, the file modification time is set <br>
to the current time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a : append contents of source
file to target name. Target file modification time is set to
the current time. If target file does not exist, it is
created with permission <br>
bits set as under -o. Unlike all other options, -a allows
multiple source files to have the same target name, e.g.
&quot;mmv -a c big&quot; will append all &quot;.c&quot;
files to &quot;big&quot;. <br>
Chains and cycles are also allowed, so &quot;mmv -a f
f&quot; will double up &quot;f&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l : link target name to source
file. Both must be on the same device, and the source must
not be a directory. Chains and cycles are not allowed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s : same as -l, but use
symbolic links instead of hard links. For the resulting link
to aim back at the source, either the source name must begin
with a &rsquo;/&rsquo;, or the target <br>
must reside in either the current or the source directory.
If none of these conditions are met, the link is refused.
However, source and target can reside on different <br>
devices, and the source can be a directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Only one of these option may be
given, and it applies to all matching files. Remaining
options need not be given separately, i.e. &quot;mmv
-mk&quot; is allowed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Multiple Pattern Pairs / Reading
Patterns from STDIN</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Multiple from -- to pattern
pairs may be specified by omitting the pattern pair on the
command line, and entering them on the standard input, one
pair per line. (If a pattern <br>
pair is given on the command line, the standard input is not
read.) Thus,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mmv <br>
a b <br>
c d</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">would rename &quot;a&quot; to
&quot;b&quot; and &quot;c&quot; to &quot;d&quot;. If a file
can be matched to several of the given from patterns, the to
pattern of the first matching pair is used. Thus,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mmv <br>
a b <br>
a c</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">would give the error message
&quot;a -&gt; c : no match&quot; because file &quot;a&quot;
(even if it exists) was already matched by the first pattern
pair.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WARNING: This operation mode
does not work if the patterns itself contain spaces. See
http://bugs.debian.org/149873 for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The From Pattern</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The from pattern is a filename
with embedded wildcards: &rsquo;*&rsquo;, &rsquo;?&rsquo;,
&rsquo;[&rsquo;...&rsquo;]&rsquo;, and &rsquo;;&rsquo;. The
first three have their usual sh(1) meanings of,
respectively, matching any string of <br>
characters, matching any single character, and matching any
one of a set of characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Between the &rsquo;[&rsquo; and
&rsquo;]&rsquo;, a range from character &rsquo;a&rsquo;
through character &rsquo;z&rsquo; is specified with
&quot;a-z&quot;. The set of matching characters can be
negated by inserting a &rsquo;^&rsquo; after the <br>
&rsquo;[&rsquo;. Thus, &quot;[^b-e2-5_]&quot; will match any
character but &rsquo;b&rsquo; through &rsquo;e&rsquo;,
&rsquo;2&rsquo; through &rsquo;5&rsquo;, and
&rsquo;_&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that paths are allowed in
the patterns, and wildcards may be intermingled with slashes
arbitrarily. The &rsquo;;&rsquo; wildcard is useful for
matching files at any depth in the direc&acirc; <br>
tory tree. It matches the same as &quot;*/&quot; repeated
any number of times, including zero, and can only occur
either at the beginning of the pattern or following a
&rsquo;/&rsquo;. Thus &quot;;*.c&quot; <br>
will match all &quot;.c&quot; files in or below the current
directory, while &quot;/;*.c&quot; will match them anywhere
on the file system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition, if the from pattern
(or the to pattern) begins with &quot;~/&quot;, the
&rsquo;~&rsquo; is replaced with the home directory name.
(Note that the &quot;~user&quot; feature of csh(1) is not
imple&acirc; <br>
mented.) However, the &rsquo;~&rsquo; is not treated as a
wildcard, in the sense that it is not assigned a wildcard
index (see below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since matching a directory under
a task option other than -r or -s would result in an error,
tasks other than -r and -s match directories only against
completely explicit from <br>
patterns (i.e. not containing wildcards). Under -r and -s,
this applies only to &quot;.&quot; and &quot;..&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Files beginning with
&rsquo;.&rsquo; are only matched against from patterns that
begin with an explicit &rsquo;.&rsquo;. However, if -h is
specified, they are matched normally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning: since the shell
normally expands wildcards before passing the command-line
arguments to mmv, it is usually necessary to enclose the
command-line from and to patterns in <br>
quotes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The To Pattern</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The to pattern is a filename
with embedded wildcard indexes, where an index consists of
the character &rsquo;#&rsquo; followed by a string of
digits. When a source file matches a from pat&acirc; <br>
tern, a target name for the file is constructed out of the
to pattern by replacing the wildcard indexes by the actual
characters that matched the referenced wildcards in the <br>
source name. Thus, if the from pattern is &quot;abc*.*&quot;
and the to pattern is &quot;xyz#2.#1&quot;, then
&quot;abc.txt&quot; is targeted to &quot;xyztxt.&quot;. (The
first &rsquo;*&rsquo; matched &quot;&quot;, and the second
matched <br>
&quot;txt&quot;.) Similarly, for the pattern pair
&quot;;*.[clp]&quot; -&gt; &quot;#1#3/#2&quot;,
&quot;foo1/foo2/prog.c&quot; is targeted to
&quot;foo1/foo2/c/prog&quot;. Note that there is no
&rsquo;/&rsquo; following the &quot;#1&quot; in the to <br>
pattern, since the string matched by any &rsquo;;&rsquo; is
always either empty or ends in a &rsquo;/&rsquo;. In this
case, it matches &quot;foo1/foo2/&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To convert the string matched by
a wildcard to either lowercase or uppercase before embedding
it in the target name, insert &rsquo;l&rsquo; or
&rsquo;u&rsquo;, respectively, between the &rsquo;#&rsquo;
and the <br>
string of digits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The to pattern, like the from
pattern, can begin with a &quot;~/&quot; (see above). This
does not necessitate enclosing the to pattern in quotes on
the command line since csh(1) expands <br>
the &rsquo;~&rsquo; in the exact same manner as mmv (or, in
the case of sh(1), does not expand it at all).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For all task options other than
-r, if the target name is a directory, the real target name
is formed by appending a &rsquo;/&rsquo; followed by the
last component of the source file name. <br>
For example, &quot;mmv dir1/a dir2&quot; will, if
&quot;dir2&quot; is indeed a directory, actually move
&quot;dir1/a&quot; to &quot;dir2/a&quot;. However, if
&quot;dir2/a&quot; already exists and is itself a directory,
this is <br>
considered an error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To strip any character (e.g.
&rsquo;*&rsquo;, &rsquo;?&rsquo;, or &rsquo;#&rsquo;) of its
special meaning to mmv, as when the actual replacement name
must contain the character &rsquo;#&rsquo;, precede the
special character <br>
with a &Acirc;&acute;&acute; (and enclose the argument in
quotes because of the shell). This also works to terminate a
wildcard index when it has to be followed by a digit in the
filename, e.g. <br>
&quot;a#11&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Chains and Cycles</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A chain is a sequence of
specified actions where the target name of one action refers
to the source file of another action. For example,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mmv <br>
a b <br>
b c</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">specifies the chain
&quot;a&quot; -&gt; &quot;b&quot; -&gt; &quot;c&quot;. A
cycle is a chain where the last target name refers back to
the first source file, e.g. &quot;mmv a a&quot;. Mmv detects
chains and cycles regard&acirc; <br>
less of the order in which their constituent actions are
actually given. Where allowed, i.e. in moving, renaming, and
appending files, chains and cycles are handled gracefully,
<br>
by performing them in the proper order. Cycles are broken by
first renaming one of the files to a temporary name (or just
remembering its original size when doing appends).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Collisions and Deletions</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When any two or more matching
files would have to be moved, copied, or linked to the same
target filename, mmv detects the condition as an error
before performing any actions. <br>
Furthermore, mmv checks if any of its actions will result in
the destruction of existing files. If the -d (delete) option
is specified, all file deletions or overwrites are done <br>
silently. Under -p (protect), all deletions or overwrites
(except those specified with &quot;(*)&quot; on the standard
input, see below) are treated as errors. And if neither
option is <br>
specified, the user is queried about each deletion or
overwrite separately. (A new stream to &quot;/dev/tty&quot;
is used for all interactive queries, not the standard
input.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Error Handling</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Whenever any error in the
user&rsquo;s action specifications is detected, an error
message is given on the standard output, and mmv proceeds to
check the rest of the specified actions. <br>
Once all errors are detected, mmv queries the user whether
he wishes to continue by avoiding the erroneous actions or
to abort altogether. This and all other queries may be <br>
avoided by specifying either the -g (go) or -t (terminate)
option. The former will resolve all difficulties by avoiding
the erroneous actions; the latter will abort mmv if any <br>
errors are detected. Specifying either of them defaults mmv
to -p, unless -d is specified (see above). Thus, -g and -t
are most useful when running mmv in the background or in
<br>
a shell script, when interactive queries are
undesirable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Reports</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once the actions to be performed
are determined, mmv performs them silently, unless either
the -v (verbose) or -n (no-execute) option is specified. The
former causes mmv to <br>
report each performed action on the standard output as</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a -&gt; b : done.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here, &quot;a&quot; and
&quot;b&quot; would be replaced by the source and target
names, respectively. If the action deletes the old target, a
&quot;(*)&quot; is inserted after the the target name. Also,
the <br>
&quot;-&gt;&quot; symbol is modified when a cycle has to be
broken: the &rsquo;&gt;&rsquo; is changed to a
&rsquo;^&rsquo; on the action prior to which the old target
is renamed to a temporary, and the &rsquo;-&rsquo; is
changed <br>
to a &rsquo;=&rsquo; on the action where the temporary is
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Under -n, none of the actions
are performed, but messages like the above are printed on
the standard output with the &quot;: done.&quot;
omitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The output generated by -n can
(after editing, if desired) be fed back to mmv on the
standard input (by omitting the from -- to pair on the mmv
command line). To facilitate <br>
this, mmv ignores lines on the standard input that look like
its own error and &quot;done&quot; messages, as well as all
lines beginning with white space, and will accept pattern
pairs <br>
with or without the intervening &quot;-&gt;&quot; (or
&quot;-^&quot;, &quot;=&gt;&quot;, or &quot;=^&quot;). Lines
with &quot;(*)&quot; after the target pattern have the
effect of enabling -d for the files matching this pattern
only, <br>
so that such deletions are done silently.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WARNING: This means that
unexpected things may happen if files matched by the
patterns contain spaces. See http://bugs.debian.org/149873
for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When feeding mmv its own output,
one must remember to specify again the task option (if any)
originally used to generate it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Although mmv attempts to predict
all mishaps prior to performing any specified actions,
accidents may happen. For example, mmv does not check for
adequate free space when copy&acirc; <br>
ing. Thus, despite all efforts, it is still possible for an
action to fail after some others have already been done. To
make recovery as easy as possible, mmv reports which <br>
actions have already been done and which are still to be
performed after such a failure occurs. It then aborts, not
attempting to do anything else. Once the user has cleared up
<br>
the problem, he can feed this report back to mmv on the
standard input to have it complete the task. (The user is
queried for a file name to dump this report if the standard
<br>
output has not been redirected.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
Mmv exits with status 1 if it aborts before doing anything,
with status 2 if it aborts due to failure after completing
some of the actions, and with status 0 otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
If the search pattern is not quoted, the shell expands the
wildcards. Mmv then (usually) gives some error message, but
can not determine that the lack of quotes is the cause.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To avoid difficulties in
semantics and error checking, mmv refuses to move or create
directories.</p>
