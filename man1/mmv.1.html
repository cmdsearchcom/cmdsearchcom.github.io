<i>Mmv</i> moves (or copies, appends, or links, as specified) each source file
  matching a <i>from</i> pattern to the target name specified by the <i>to</i>
  pattern. This multiple action is performed safely, i.e. without any unexpected
  deletion of files due to collisions of target names with existing filenames or
  with other target names. Furthermore, before doing anything, <i>mmv</i>
  attempts to detect any errors that would result from the entire set of actions
  specified and gives the user the choice of either proceeding by avoiding the
  offending parts or aborting. <i>mmv</i> does support large files (LFS) but it
  does *NOT* support sparse files (i.e. it explodes them).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
The Task Options
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Whether <i>mmv</i> moves, copies, appends, or links is governed by the first set
  of options given above. If none of these are specified, the task is given by
  the command name under which <i>mmv</i> was invoked (argv[0]):
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
	command name	default task
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
	mmv			-x
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
	mcp			-c
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
	mad			-a
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
	mln			-l
<div class="Pp"></div>
The task option choices are:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">-m :</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">move source file to target name. Both must be on the same
      device. Will not move directories. If the source file is a symbolic link,
      moves the link without checking if the link's target from the new
      directory is different than the old. </dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">-x :</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">same as -m, except cross-device moves are done by copying,
      then deleting source. When copying, sets the permission bits and file
      modification time of the target file to that of the source file.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">-r :</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">rename source file or directory to target name. The target
      name must not include a path: the file remains in the same directory in
      all cases. This option is the only way of renaming directories under
      <i>mmv</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">-c :</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">copy source file to target name. Sets the file modification
      time and permission bits of the target file to that of the source file,
      regardless of whether the target file already exists. Chains and cycles
      (to be explained below) are not allowed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">-o :</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">overwrite target name with source file. If target file
      exists, it is overwritten, keeping its original owner and permission bits.
      If it does not exist, it is created, with read-write permission bits set
      according to <i>umask</i>(1), and the execute permission bits copied from
      the source file. In either case, the file modification time is set to the
      current time. </dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">-a :</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">append contents of source file to target name. Target file
      modification time is set to the current time. If target file does not
      exist, it is created with permission bits set as under -o. Unlike all
      other options, -a allows multiple source files to have the same target
      name, e.g. &quot;mmv -a \*.c big&quot; will append all &quot;.c&quot;
      files to &quot;big&quot;. Chains and cycles are also allowed, so &quot;mmv
      -a f f&quot; will double up &quot;f&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">-l :</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">link target name to source file. Both must be on the same
      device, and the source must not be a directory. Chains and cycles are not
      allowed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">-s :</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">same as -l, but use symbolic links instead of hard links.
      For the resulting link to aim back at the source, either the source name
      must begin with a '/', or the target must reside in either the current or
      the source directory. If none of these conditions are met, the link is
      refused. However, source and target can reside on different devices, and
      the source can be a directory. </dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Only one of these option may be given, and it applies to all matching files.
  Remaining options need not be given separately, i.e. &quot;mmv -mk&quot; is
  allowed.

<div>&#x00A0;</div>
Multiple Pattern Pairs / Reading Patterns from STDIN
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Multiple <i>from</i> -- <i>to</i> pattern pairs may be specified by omitting the
  pattern pair on the command line, and entering them on the standard input, one
  pair per line. (If a pattern pair is given on the command line, the standard
  input is not read.) Thus,
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
mmv
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
a b
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
c d
<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
would rename &quot;a&quot; to &quot;b&quot; and &quot;c&quot; to &quot;d&quot;.
  If a file can be matched to several of the given <i>from</i> patterns, the
  <i>to</i> pattern of the first matching pair is used. Thus,
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
mmv
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
a b
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
a c
<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
would give the error message &quot;a -&gt; c : no match&quot; because file
  &quot;a&quot; (even if it exists) was already matched by the first pattern
  pair.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>WARNING:</b> This operation mode does <b>not</b> work if the patterns itself
  contain <b>spaces</b>. See <i>http://bugs.debian.org/149873</i> for details.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
The <i>From</i> Pattern
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <i>from</i> pattern is a filename with embedded wildcards: '*', '?',
  '['...']', and ';'. The first three have their usual <i>sh</i>(1) meanings of,
  respectively, matching any string of characters, matching any single
  character, and matching any one of a set of characters.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Between the '[' and ']', a range from character 'a' through character 'z' is
  specified with &quot;a-z&quot;. The set of matching characters can be negated
  by inserting a '^' after the '['. Thus, &quot;[^b-e2-5_]&quot; will match any
  character but 'b' through 'e', '2' through '5', and '_'.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that paths are allowed in the patterns, and wildcards may be intermingled
  with slashes arbitrarily. The ';' wildcard is useful for matching files at any
  depth in the directory tree. It matches the same as &quot;*/&quot; repeated
  any number of times, including zero, and can only occur either at the
  beginning of the pattern or following a '/'. Thus &quot;;*.c&quot; will match
  all &quot;.c&quot; files in or below the current directory, while
  &quot;/;*.c&quot; will match them anywhere on the file system.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In addition, if the <i>from</i> pattern (or the <i>to</i> pattern) begins with
  &quot;~/&quot;, the '~' is replaced with the home directory name. (Note that
  the &quot;~user&quot; feature of <i>csh</i>(1) is not implemented.) However,
  the '~' is not treated as a wildcard, in the sense that it is not assigned a
  wildcard index (see below).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Since matching a directory under a task option other than -r or -s would result
  in an error, tasks other than -r and -s match directories only against
  completely explicit <i>from</i> patterns (i.e. not containing wildcards).
  Under -r and -s, this applies only to &quot;.&quot; and &quot;..&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Files beginning with '.' are only matched against <i>from</i> patterns that
  begin with an explicit '.'. However, if -h is specified, they are matched
  normally.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Warning: since the shell normally expands wildcards before passing the
  command-line arguments to <i>mmv</i>, it is usually necessary to enclose the
  command-line <i>from</i> and <i>to</i> patterns in quotes.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
The <i>To</i> Pattern
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <i>to</i> pattern is a filename with embedded <i>wildcard</i>
  <i>indexes</i>, where an index consists of the character '#' followed by a
  string of digits. When a source file matches a <i>from</i> pattern, a target
  name for the file is constructed out of the <i>to</i> pattern by replacing the
  wildcard indexes by the actual characters that matched the referenced
  wildcards in the source name. Thus, if the <i>from</i> pattern is
  &quot;abc*.*&quot; and the <i>to</i> pattern is &quot;xyz#2.#1&quot;, then
  &quot;abc.txt&quot; is targeted to &quot;xyztxt.&quot;. (The first '*' matched
  &quot;&quot;, and the second matched &quot;txt&quot;.) Similarly, for the
  pattern pair &quot;;*.[clp]&quot; -&gt; &quot;#1#3/#2&quot;,
  &quot;foo1/foo2/prog.c&quot; is targeted to &quot;foo1/foo2/c/prog&quot;. Note
  that there is no '/' following the &quot;#1&quot; in the <i>to</i> pattern,
  since the string matched by any ';' is always either empty or ends in a '/'.
  In this case, it matches &quot;foo1/foo2/&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To convert the string matched by a wildcard to either lowercase or uppercase
  before embedding it in the target name, insert 'l' or 'u', respectively,
  between the '#' and the string of digits.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <i>to</i> pattern, like the <i>from</i> pattern, can begin with a
  &quot;~/&quot; (see above). This does not necessitate enclosing the <i>to</i>
  pattern in quotes on the command line since <i>csh</i>(1) expands the '~' in
  the exact same manner as <i>mmv</i> (or, in the case of <i>sh</i>(1), does not
  expand it at all).
<div class="Pp"></div>
For all task options other than -r, if the target name is a directory, the real
  target name is formed by appending a '/' followed by the last component of the
  source file name. For example, &quot;mmv dir1/a dir2&quot; will, if
  &quot;dir2&quot; is indeed a directory, actually move &quot;dir1/a&quot; to
  &quot;dir2/a&quot;. However, if &quot;dir2/a&quot; already exists and is
  itself a directory, this is considered an error.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To strip any character (e.g. '*', '?', or '#') of its special meaning to
  <i>mmv</i>, as when the actual replacement name must contain the character
  '#', precede the special character with a &#x00B4;\' (and enclose the argument
  in quotes because of the shell). This also works to terminate a wildcard index
  when it has to be followed by a digit in the filename, e.g. &quot;a#1\1&quot;.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
Chains and Cycles
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
A chain is a sequence of specified actions where the target name of one action
  refers to the source file of another action. For example,
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
mmv
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
a b
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
b c
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
specifies the chain &quot;a&quot; -&gt; &quot;b&quot; -&gt; &quot;c&quot;. A
  cycle is a chain where the last target name refers back to the first source
  file, e.g. &quot;mmv a a&quot;. <i>Mmv</i> detects chains and cycles
  regardless of the order in which their constituent actions are actually given.
  Where allowed, i.e. in moving, renaming, and appending files, chains and
  cycles are handled gracefully, by performing them in the proper order. Cycles
  are broken by first renaming one of the files to a temporary name (or just
  remembering its original size when doing appends).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
Collisions and Deletions
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
When any two or more matching files would have to be moved, copied, or linked to
  the same target filename, <i>mmv</i> detects the condition as an error before
  performing any actions. Furthermore, <i>mmv</i> checks if any of its actions
  will result in the destruction of existing files. If the -d (delete) option is
  specified, all file deletions or overwrites are done silently. Under -p
  (protect), all deletions or overwrites (except those specified with
  &quot;(*)&quot; on the standard input, see below) are treated as errors. And
  if neither option is specified, the user is queried about each deletion or
  overwrite separately. (A new stream to &quot;/dev/tty&quot; is used for all
  interactive queries, not the standard input.)
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
Error Handling
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Whenever any error in the user's action specifications is detected, an error
  message is given on the standard output, and <i>mmv</i> proceeds to check the
  rest of the specified actions. Once all errors are detected, <i>mmv</i>
  queries the user whether he wishes to continue by avoiding the erroneous
  actions or to abort altogether. This and all other queries may be avoided by
  specifying either the -g (go) or -t (terminate) option. The former will
  resolve all difficulties by avoiding the erroneous actions; the latter will
  abort <i>mmv</i> if any errors are detected. Specifying either of them
  defaults <i>mmv</i> to -p, unless -d is specified (see above). Thus, -g and -t
  are most useful when running <i>mmv</i> in the background or in a shell
  script, when interactive queries are undesirable.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
Reports
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Once the actions to be performed are determined, <i>mmv</i> performs them
  silently, unless either the -v (verbose) or -n (no-execute) option is
  specified. The former causes <i>mmv</i> to report each performed action on the
  standard output as
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
a -&gt; b : done.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Here, &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; would be replaced by the source and target
  names, respectively. If the action deletes the old target, a &quot;(*)&quot;
  is inserted after the the target name. Also, the &quot;-&gt;&quot; symbol is
  modified when a cycle has to be broken: the '&gt;' is changed to a '^' on the
  action prior to which the old target is renamed to a temporary, and the '-' is
  changed to a '=' on the action where the temporary is used.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Under -n, none of the actions are performed, but messages like the above are
  printed on the standard output with the &quot;: done.&quot; omitted.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The output generated by -n can (after editing, if desired) be fed back to
  <i>mmv</i> on the standard input (by omitting the <i>from</i> -- <i>to</i>
  pair on the <i>mmv</i> command line). To facilitate this, <i>mmv</i> ignores
  lines on the standard input that look like its own error and &quot;done&quot;
  messages, as well as all lines beginning with white space, and will accept
  pattern pairs with or without the intervening &quot;-&gt;&quot; (or
  &quot;-^&quot;, &quot;=&gt;&quot;, or &quot;=^&quot;). Lines with
  &quot;(*)&quot; after the target pattern have the effect of enabling -d for
  the files matching this pattern only, so that such deletions are done
  silently.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>WARNING:</b> This means that <b>unexpected things</b> may happen if
  <b>files</b> matched by the patterns contain <b>spaces</b>. See
  <i>http://bugs.debian.org/149873</i> for details.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
When feeding <i>mmv</i> its own output, one must remember to specify again the
  task option (if any) originally used to generate it.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Although <i>mmv</i> attempts to predict all mishaps prior to performing any
  specified actions, accidents may happen. For example, <i>mmv</i> does not
  check for adequate free space when copying. Thus, despite all efforts, it is
  still possible for an action to fail after some others have already been done.
  To make recovery as easy as possible, <i>mmv</i> reports which actions have
  already been done and which are still to be performed after such a failure
  occurs. It then aborts, not attempting to do anything else. Once the user has
  cleared up the problem, he can feed this report back to <i>mmv</i> on the
  standard input to have it complete the task. (The user is queried for a file
  name to dump this report if the standard output has not been redirected.)
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="EXIT_STATUS"><a class="selflink" href="#EXIT_STATUS">EXIT

<i>Mmv</i> exits with status 1 if it aborts before doing anything, with status 2

  status 0 otherwise.

If the search pattern is not quoted, the shell expands the wildcards. <i>Mmv</i>
  then (usually) gives some error message, but can not determine that the lack
  of quotes is the cause.

To avoid difficulties in semantics and error checking, <i>mmv</i> refuses to
  move or create directories.</div>
