<p>lame(1) LAME audio compressor lame(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
lame - create mp3 audio files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
lame [options] &lt;infile&gt; &lt;outfile&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
LAME is a program which can be used to create compressed
audio files. (Lame ain&rsquo;t an MP3 encoder). These audio
files can be played back by popular MP3 players such as
mpg123 or <br>
madplay. To read from stdin, use &quot;-&quot; for
&lt;infile&gt;. To write to stdout, use &quot;-&quot; for
&lt;outfile&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Input options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Assume the input file is raw
pcm. Sampling rate and mono/stereo/jstereo must be specified
on the command line. For each stereo sample, LAME expects
the input data to be <br>
ordered left channel first, then right channel. By default,
LAME expects them to be signed integers with a bitwidth of
16. Without -r, LAME will perform several fseek()&rsquo;s
<br>
on the input file looking for WAV and AIFF headers. <br>
Might not be available on your release.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x Swap bytes in the input file
or output file when using --decode. <br>
For sorting out little endian/big endian type problems. If
your encodings sounds like static, try this first. <br>
Without using -x, LAME will treat input file as native
endian.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s sfreq <br>
sfreq = 8/11.025/12/16/22.05/24/32/44.1/48</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Required only for raw PCM input
files. Otherwise it will be determined from the header of
the input file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LAME will automatically resample
the input file to one of the supported MP3 samplerates if
necessary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--bitwidth n <br>
Input bit width per sample. <br>
n = 8, 16, 24, 32 (default 16)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Required only for raw PCM input
files. Otherwise it will be determined from the header of
the input file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--signed <br>
Instructs LAME that the samples from the input are signed
(the default for 16, 24 and 32 bits raw pcm data).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Required only for raw PCM input
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--unsigned <br>
Instructs LAME that the samples from the input are unsigned
(the default for 8 bits raw pcm data, where 0x80 is
zero).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Required only for raw PCM input
files and only available at bitwidth 8.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--little-endian <br>
Instructs LAME that the samples from the input are in
little-endian form.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Required only for raw PCM input
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--big-endian <br>
Instructs LAME that the samples from the input are in
big-endian form.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Required only for raw PCM input
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--mp2input <br>
Assume the input file is a MPEG Layer II (ie MP2) file. <br>
If the filename ends in &quot;.mp2&quot; LAME will assume it
is a MPEG Layer II file. For stdin or Layer II files which
do not end in .mp2 you need to use this switch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--mp3input <br>
Assume the input file is a MP3 file. <br>
Useful for downsampling from one mp3 to another. As an
example, it can be useful for streaming through an IceCast
server. <br>
If the filename ends in &quot;.mp3&quot; LAME will assume it
is an MP3. For stdin or MP3 files which do not end in .mp3
you need to use this switch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--nogap file1 file2 ... <br>
gapless encoding for a set of contiguous files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--nogapout dir <br>
output dir for gapless encoding (must precede --nogap)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Operational options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m mode <br>
mode = s, j, f, d, m, l, r</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Joint-stereo is the default mode
for stereo files with VBR when -V is more than 4 or fixed
bitrates of 160kbs or less. At higher fixed bitrates or
higher VBR settings, <br>
the default is stereo.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(s)imple stereo <br>
In this mode, the encoder makes no use of potentially
existing correlations between the two input channels. It
can, however, negotiate the bit demand between both
chan&acirc; <br>
nel, i.e. give one channel more bits if the other contains
silence or needs less bits because of a lower
complexity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(j)oint stereo <br>
In this mode, the encoder will make use of a correlation
between both channels. The signal will be matrixed into a
sum (&quot;mid&quot;), computed by L+R, and difference
(&quot;side&quot;) <br>
signal, computed by L-R, and more bits are allocated to the
mid channel. This will effectively increase the bandwidth if
the signal does not have too much stereo separa&acirc; <br>
tion, thus giving a significant gain in encoding
quality.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using mid/side stereo
inappropriately can result in audible compression artifacts.
To much switching between mid/side and regular stereo can
also sound bad. To determine <br>
when to switch to mid/side stereo, LAME uses a much more
sophisticated algorithm than that described in the ISO
documentation, and thus is safe to use in joint stereo <br>
mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(f)orced MS stereo <br>
This mode will force MS stereo on all frames. It is slightly
faster than joint stereo, but it should be used only if you
are sure that every frame of the input file has <br>
very little stereo separation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(d)ual mono <br>
In this mode, the 2 channels will be totally independently
encoded. Each channel will have exactly half of the bitrate.
This mode is designed for applications like dual <br>
languages encoding (for example: English in one channel and
French in the other). Using this encoding mode for regular
stereo files will result in a lower quality encod&acirc;
<br>
ing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(m)ono <br>
The input will be encoded as a mono signal. If it was a
stereo signal, it will be downsampled to mono. The downmix
is calculated as the sum of the left and right chan&acirc;
<br>
nel, attenuated by 6 dB.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(l)eft channel only <br>
The input will be encoded as a mono signal. If it was a
stereo signal, the left channel will be encoded only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(r)ight channel only <br>
The input will be encoded as a mono signal. If it was a
stereo signal, the right channel will be encoded only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a Mix the stereo input file to
mono and encode as mono. <br>
The downmix is calculated as the sum of the left and right
channel, attenuated by 6 dB.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is only needed in
the case of raw PCM stereo input (because LAME cannot
determine the number of channels in the input file). To
encode a stereo PCM input file <br>
as mono, use lame -m s -a.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For WAV and AIFF input files,
using -m will always produce a mono .mp3 file from both mono
and stereo input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Allows the left and right
channels to use different block size types.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--freeformat <br>
Produces a free format bitstream. With this option, you can
use -b with any bitrate higher than 8 kbps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, even if an mp3 decoder
is required to support free bitrates at least up to 320
kbps, many players are unable to deal with it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tests have shown that the
following decoders support free format: <br>
FreeAmp up to 440 kbps <br>
in_mpg123 up to 560 kbps <br>
l3dec up to 310 kbps <br>
LAME up to 560 kbps <br>
MAD up to 640 kbps</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--decode <br>
Uses LAME for decoding to a wav file. The input file can be
any input type supported by encoding, including layer II
files. LAME uses a bugfixed version of mpglib for <br>
decoding.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If -t is used (disable wav
header), LAME will output raw pcm in native endian format.
You can use -x to swap bytes order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is not usable if the
MP3 decoder was explicitly disabled in the build of
LAME.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Disable writing of the INFO
Tag on encoding. <br>
This tag in embedded in frame 0 of the MP3 file. It includes
some information about the encoding options of the file, and
in VBR it lets VBR aware players correctly seek <br>
and compute playing times of VBR files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When --decode is specified
(decode to WAV), this flag will disable writing of the WAV
header. The output will be raw pcm, native endian format.
Use -x to swap bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--comp arg <br>
Instead of choosing bitrate, using this option, user can
choose compression ratio to achieve.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--scale n <br>
--scale-l n <br>
--scale-r n <br>
Scales input (every channel, only left channel or only right
channel) by n. This just multiplies the PCM data (after it
has been converted to floating point) by n.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">n &gt; 1: increase volume <br>
n = 1: no effect <br>
n &lt; 1: reduce volume</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use with care, since most MP3
decoders will truncate data which decodes to values greater
than 32768.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--replaygain-fast <br>
Compute ReplayGain fast but slightly inaccurately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This computes &quot;Radio&quot;
ReplayGain on the input data stream after
user&acirc;specified volume&acirc;scaling and/or
resampling.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ReplayGain analysis does not
affect the content of a compressed data stream itself, it is
a value stored in the header of a sound file. Information on
the purpose of <br>
ReplayGain and the algorithms used is available from
http://www.replaygain.org/.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Only the &quot;RadioGain&quot;
Replaygain value is computed, it is stored in the LAME tag.
The analysis is performed with the reference volume equal to
89dB. Note: the reference <br>
volume has been changed from 83dB on transition from version
3.95 to 3.95.1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This switch is enabled by
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See also: --replaygain-accurate,
--noreplaygain</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--replaygain-accurate <br>
Compute ReplayGain more accurately and find the peak
sample.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This enables decoding on the
fly, computes &quot;Radio&quot; ReplayGain on the decoded
data stream, finds the peak sample of the decoded data
stream and stores it in the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ReplayGain analysis does not
affect the content of a compressed data stream itself, it is
a value stored in the header of a sound file. Information on
the purpose of <br>
ReplayGain and the algorithms used is available from
http://www.replaygain.org/.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, LAME performs
ReplayGain analysis on the input data (after the
user&acirc;specified volume scaling). This behavior might
give slightly inaccurate results because <br>
the data on the output of a lossy compression/decompression
sequence differs from the initial input data. When
--replaygain-accurate is specified the mp3 stream gets <br>
decoded on the fly and the analysis is performed on the
decoded data stream. Although theoretically this method
gives more accurate results, it has several
disadvantages:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* tests have shown that the
difference between the ReplayGain values computed on the
input data and decoded data is usually not greater than
0.5dB, although the minimum <br>
volume difference the human ear can perceive is about
1.0dB</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* decoding on the fly
significantly slows down the encoding process</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The apparent advantage is
that:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* with --replaygain-accurate the
real peak sample is determined and stored in the file. The
knowledge of the peak sample can be useful to decoders
(players) to prevent <br>
a negative effect called &rsquo;clipping&rsquo; that
introduces distortion into the sound.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Only the &quot;RadioGain&quot;
ReplayGain value is computed, it is stored in the LAME tag.
The analysis is performed with the reference volume equal to
89dB. Note: the reference <br>
volume has been changed from 83dB on transition from version
3.95 to 3.95.1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is not usable if the
MP3 decoder was explicitly disabled in the build of LAME.
(Note: if LAME is compiled without the MP3 decoder,
ReplayGain analysis is per&acirc; <br>
formed on the input data after user-specified volume
scaling).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See also: --replaygain-fast,
--noreplaygain --clipdetect</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--noreplaygain <br>
Disable ReplayGain analysis.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default ReplayGain analysis
is enabled. This switch disables it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See also: --replaygain-fast,
--replaygain-accurate</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--clipdetect <br>
Clipping detection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enable --replaygain-accurate and
print a message whether clipping occurs and how far in dB
the waveform is from full scale.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is not usable if the
MP3 decoder was explicitly disabled in the build of

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--noasm type <br>
Disable specific assembly optimizations ( mmx / 3dnow / sse
). Quality will not increase, only speed will be reduced. If
you have problems running Lame on a Cyrix/Via <br>

problem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Verbosity:</p>

Set the delay in seconds between two display updates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--nohist <br>
By default, LAME will display a bitrate histogram while
producing VBR mp3 files. This will disable that feature.
<br>
Histogram display might not be available on your
release.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S <br>
--silent <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Noise shaping &amp; psycho
acoustic algorithms:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q qual <br>
0 &lt;= qual &lt;= 9</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bitrate is of course the main
influence on quality. The higher the bitrate, the higher the
quality. But for a given bitrate, we have a choice of
algorithms to determine <br>
the best scalefactors and Huffman encoding (noise
shaping).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q 0: <br>
use slowest &amp; best possible version of all algorithms.
-q 0 and -q 1 are slow and may not produce significantly
higher quality.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q 2: <br>
recommended. Same as -h.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q 5: <br>
default value. Good speed, reasonable quality.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q 7: <br>
same as -f. Very fast, ok quality. Psycho acoustics are used
for pre-echo &amp; M/S, but no noise shaping is done.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q 9: <br>
disables almost all algorithms including psy-model. Poor
quality.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Use some quality
improvements. Encoding will be slower, but the result will
be of higher quality. The behavior is the same as the -q 2
switch. <br>
This switch is always enabled when using VBR.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f This switch forces the
encoder to use a faster encoding mode, but with a lower
quality. The behavior is the same as the -q 7 switch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Noise shaping will be disabled,
but psycho acoustics will still be computed for bit
allocation and pre-echo detection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CBR (constant bitrate, the
default) options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b n For MPEG-1 (sampling
frequencies of 32, 44.1 and 48 kHz) <br>
n = 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 80, 96, 112, 128, 160, 192, 224,
256, 320</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For MPEG-2 (sampling frequencies
of 16, 22.05 and 24 kHz) <br>
n = 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 80, 96, 112, 128, 144,

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default is 128 for MPEG1 and 64
for MPEG2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--cbr enforce use of constant
bitrate</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ABR (average bitrate)
options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--abr n <br>
Turns on encoding with a targeted average bitrate of n
kbits, allowing to use frames of different sizes. The
allowed range of n is 8 - 310, you can use any integer value
<br>
within that range.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It can be combined with the -b
and -B switches like: lame --abr 123 -b 64 -B 192 a.wav
a.mp3 which would limit the allowed frame sizes between 64
and 192 kbits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The use of -B is NOT
RECOMMENDED. A 128 kbps CBR bitstream, because of the bit
reservoir, can actually have frames which use as many bits
as a 320 kbps frame. VBR modes <br>
minimize the use of the bit reservoir, and thus need to
allow 320 kbps frames to get the same flexibility as CBR
streams.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VBR (variable bitrate)
options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v use variable bitrate
(--vbr-new)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--vbr-old <br>
Invokes the oldest, most tested VBR algorithm. It produces
very good quality files, though is not very fast. This has,
up through v3.89, been considered the &quot;workhorse&quot;
<br>
VBR algorithm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--vbr-new <br>
Invokes the newest VBR algorithm. During the development of
version 3.90, considerable tuning was done on this
algorithm, and it is now considered to be on par with the
<br>
original --vbr-old. It has the added advantage of being very
fast (over twice as fast as --vbr-old).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V n 0 &lt;= n &lt;= 9 <br>
Enable VBR (Variable BitRate) and specifies the value of VBR

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MP3 header/stream options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e emp emp = n, 5, c</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">n = (none, default) <br>
5 = 0/15 microseconds <br>
c = citt j.17</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All this does is set a flag in
the bitstream. If you have a PCM input file where one of the
above types of (obsolete) emphasis has been applied, you can
set this flag in <br>
LAME. Then the mp3 decoder should de-emphasize the output
during playback, although most decoders ignore this
flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A better solution would be to
apply the de-emphasis with a standalone utility before
encoding, and then encode without -e.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Mark the encoded file as

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p Turn on CRC error protection.
<br>
It will add a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) code in each
frame, allowing to detect transmission errors that could
occur on the MP3 stream. However, it takes 16 bits per <br>
frame that would otherwise be used for encoding, and then
will slightly reduce the sound quality.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--nores <br>
Disable the bit reservoir. Each frame will then become
independent from previous ones, but the quality will be
lower.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--strictly-enforce-ISO <br>
With this option, LAME will enforce the 7680 bit limitation
on total frame size. <br>
This results in many wasted bits for high bitrate encodings
but will ensure strict ISO compatibility. This compatibility
might be important for hardware players.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Filter options:</p>

(This feature is a compile time option. Your binary may for
speed reasons be compiled without <br>
this.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ID3 TAGS <br>
LAME is able to embed ID3 v1, v1.1 or v2 tags inside the
encoded MP3 file. This allows to have some useful
information about the music track included inside the file.
Those <br>
data can be read by most MP3 players.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Lame will smartly choose which
tags to use. It will add ID3 v2 tags only if the input
comments won&rsquo;t fit in v1 or v1.1 tags, i.e. if they
are more than 30 characters. In this <br>
case, both v1 and v2 tags will be added, to ensure reading
of tags by MP3 players which are unable to read ID3 v2
tags.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENCODING MODES <br>
LAME is able to encode your music using one of its 3
encoding modes: constant bitrate (CBR), average bitrate
(ABR) and variable bitrate (VBR).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Constant Bitrate (CBR) <br>
This is the default encoding mode, and also the most basic.
In this mode, the bitrate will be the same for the whole
file. It means that each part of your mp3 file will <br>
be using the same number of bits. The musical passage being
a difficult one to encode or an easy one, the encoder will
use the same bitrate, so the quality of your mp3 is <br>
variable. Complex parts will be of a lower quality than the
easiest ones. The main advantage is that the final files
size won&rsquo;t change and can be accurately predicted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Average Bitrate (ABR) <br>
In this mode, you choose the encoder will maintain an
average bitrate while using higher bitrates for the parts of
your music that need more bits. The result will be of <br>
higher quality than CBR encoding but the average file size
will remain predictable, so this mode is highly recommended
over CBR. This encoding mode is similar to what is <br>
referred as vbr in AAC or Liquid Audio (2 other compression
technologies).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Variable bitrate (VBR) <br>
In this mode, you choose the desired quality on a scale from
9 (lowest quality/biggest distortion) to 0 (highest
quality/lowest distortion). Then encoder tries to
main&acirc; <br>
tain the given quality in the whole file by choosing the
optimal number of bits to spend for each part of your music.
The main advantage is that you are able to specify <br>
the quality level that you want to reach, but the
inconvenient is that the final file size is totally
unpredictable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PRESETS <br>
The --preset switches are aliases over LAME settings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To activate these presets:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For VBR modes (generally highest
quality):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--preset medium <br>
This preset should provide near transparency to most people
on most music.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--preset standard <br>
This preset should generally be transparent to most people
on most music and is already quite high in quality.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--preset extreme <br>
If you have extremely good hearing and similar equipment,
this preset will generally provide slightly higher quality
than the standard mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For CBR 320kbps (highest quality
possible from the --preset switches):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--preset insane <br>
This preset will usually be overkill for most people and
most situations, but if you must have the absolute highest
quality with no regard to filesize, this is the way to <br>
go.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For ABR modes (high quality per
given bitrate but not as high as VBR):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--preset kbps <br>
Using this preset will usually give you good quality at a
specified bitrate. Depending on the bitrate entered, this
preset will determine the optimal settings for that <br>
particular situation. While this approach works, it is not
nearly as flexible as VBR, and usually will not attain the
same level of quality as VBR at higher bitrates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options are also
available for the corresponding profiles:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">standard|extreme <br>
cbr kbps</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cbr If you use the ABR mode
(read above) with a significant bitrate such as 80, 96, 112,
128, 160, 192, 224, 256, 320, you can use the cbr option to
force CBR mode encoding <br>
instead of the standard ABR mode. ABR does provide higher
quality but CBR may be useful in situations such as when
streaming an MP3 over the Internet may be important.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
