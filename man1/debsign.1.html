<p>DEBSIGN(1) General Commands Manual DEBSIGN(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
debsign - sign a Debian .changes and .dsc file pair using
GPG</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
debsign [options] [changes-file|dsc-file|commands-file
...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
debsign mimics the signing aspects (and bugs) of
dpkg-buildpackage(1). It takes either an unsigned .dsc file
or an unsigned .changes file (along with the associated
unsigned <br>
.dsc file found by replacing the architecture name and
.changes by .dsc if it appears in the .changes file), and
signs them using the GNU Privacy Guard. It is careful to
calcu&acirc; <br>
late the size and checksums of the newly signed .dsc file
and replace the original values in the .changes file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a .changes, .dsc or .commands
file is specified, it is signed, otherwise, debian/changelog
is parsed to determine the name of the .changes file to look
for in the parent <br>
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a .commands file is specified
it is first validated (see the details at
ftp://ftp.upload.debian.org/pub/UploadQueue/README), and the
name specified in the Uploader field is <br>
used for signing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This utility is useful if a
developer must build a package on one machine where it is
unsafe to sign it; they need then only transfer the small
.dsc and .changes files to a safe <br>
machine and then use the debsign program to sign them before
transferring them back. This process can be automated in two
ways. If the files to be signed live on the remote <br>
machine, the -r option may be used to copy them to the local
machine and back again after signing. If the files live on
the local machine, then they may be transferred to the <br>
remote machine for signing using debrsign(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This program can take default
settings from the devscripts configuration files, as
described below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-r [username@]remotehost <br>
The .changes and .dsc files live on the specified remote
host. In this case, a .changes file must be explicitly
named, with an absolute directory or one relative to the
<br>
remote home directory. scp will be used for the copying. The
[username@]remotehost:changes syntax is permitted as an
alternative. Wildcards (* etc.) are allowed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pprogname <br>
When debsign needs to execute GPG to sign it will run
progname (searching the PATH if necessary), instead of
gpg.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mmaintainer <br>
Specify the maintainer name to be used for signing. (See
dpkg-buildpackage(1) for more information about the
differences between -m, -e and -k when building packages;
<br>
debsign makes no use of these distinctions except with
respect to the precedence of the various options. These
multiple options are provided so that the program will <br>
behave as expected when called by debuild(1).)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-emaintainer <br>
Same as -m but takes precedence over it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-kkeyid <br>
Specify the key ID to be used for signing; overrides any -m
and -e options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S Look for a source-only
.changes file instead of a binary-build .changes file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-adebian-architecture,
-tGNU-system-type <br>
See dpkg-architecture(1) for a description of these options.
They affect the search for the .changes file. They are
provided to mimic the behaviour of dpkg-buildpackage <br>
when determining the name of the .changes file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--multi <br>
Multiarch .changes mode: This signifies that debsign should
use the most recent file with the name pattern
package_version_*+*.changes as the .changes file, allowing
for <br>
the .changes files produced by dpkg-cross.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--re-sign, --no-re-sign <br>
Recreate signature, respectively use the existing signature,
if the file has been signed already. If neither option is
given and an already signed file is found the user <br>
is asked if he or she likes to use the current
signature.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--debs-dir DIR <br>
Look for the .changes and .dsc files in directory DIR
instead of the parent of the source directory. This should
either be an absolute path or relative to the top of the
<br>
source directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-conf, --noconf <br>
Do not read any configuration files. This can only be used
as the first option given on the command-line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help, -h <br>
Display a help message and exit successfully.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Display version and copyright information and exit
successfully.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION VARIABLES <br>
The two configuration files /etc/devscripts.conf and
~/.devscripts are sourced in that order to set configuration
variables. Command line options can be used to override
config&acirc; <br>
uration file settings. Environment variable settings are
ignored for this purpose. The currently recognised variables
are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEBSIGN_PROGRAM <br>
Setting this is equivalent to giving a -p option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEBSIGN_MAINT <br>
This is the -m option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEBSIGN_KEYID <br>
And this is the -k option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEBSIGN_ALWAYS_RESIGN <br>
Always re-sign files even if they are already signed,
without prompting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEBRELEASE_DEBS_DIR <br>
This specifies the directory in which to look for the
.changes and .dsc files, and is either an absolute path or
relative to the top of the source tree. This corresponds
<br>
to the --debs-dir command line option. This directive could
be used, for example, if you always use pbuilder or
svn-buildpackage to build your packages. Note that it <br>
also affects debrelease(1) in the same way, hence the
strange name of the option.</p>
