clipaccumulate - Make a bunch of little clipboards into one big one.

The first thing it says (which goes to STDERR, so you can redirect into a file
  if you want), is how to exit, which is by copying the magic &quot;end&quot;
  string into the clipboard. Crufty? Yep. You can still do Ctrl+C if you don't
  like this (or if the string scrolls off the top of the screen).
<div class="Pp"></div>
The next thing it does is wait for the clipboard to change, at which point it
  will print out the new data and go back to waiting for the clipboard to
  change.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Then you copy the exit string, and it will fill the clipboard with all the
  little pieces it saw along the way.

(Right now, it just joins everything with spaces in between - is this bugging
  anyone?)
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="MOTIVATION"><a class="selflink" href="#MOTIVATION">MOTIVATION</a></h1>
Hard to explain. I run into cases where I wanted to make a bunch of small notes
  that included all these different bits of info. Instead of jotting them down
  on a scrap of paper, I made this.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Let me know how it can be made better.
