<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
sparse - Semantic Parser for C</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
sparse [WARNING OPTIONS]... file.c</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Sparse parses C source and looks for errors, producing
warnings on standard error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sparse accepts options
controlling the set of warnings to generate. To turn on
warnings Sparse does not issue by default, use the
corresponding warning option -Wsomething. <br>
Sparse issues some warnings by default; to turn off those
warnings, pass the negation of the associated warning
option, -Wno-something.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WARNING OPTIONS <br>
-Wsparse-all <br>
Turn on all sparse warnings, except for those explicitly
disabled via -Wno-something.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wsparse-error <br>
Turn all sparse warnings into errors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Waddress-space <br>
Warn about code which mixes pointers to different address
spaces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sparse allows an extended
attribute __attribute__((address_space(num))) on pointers,
which designates a pointer target in address space num (a
constant integer). With <br>
-Waddress-space, Sparse treats pointers with identical
target types but different address spaces as distinct types.
To override this warning, such as for functions which <br>
convert pointers between address spaces, use a type that
includes __attribute__((force)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sparse issues these warnings by
default. To turn them off, use -Wno-address-space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wbitwise <br>
Warn about unsupported operations or type mismatches with
restricted integer types.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sparse supports an extended
attribute, __attribute__((bitwise)), which creates a new
restricted integer type from a base integer type, distinct
from the base integer type <br>
and from any other restricted integer type not declared in
the same declaration or typedef. For example, this allows
programs to create typedefs for integer types with <br>
specific endianness. With -Wbitwise, Sparse will warn on any
use of a restricted type in arithmetic operations other than
bitwise operations, and on any conversion of one <br>
restricted type into another, except via a cast that
includes __attribute__((force)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">__bitwise ends up being a
&quot;stronger integer separation&quot;. That one
doesn&rsquo;t allow you to mix with non-bitwise integers, so
now it&rsquo;s much harder to lose the type by mistake.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">__bitwise is for *unique types*
that cannot be mixed with other types, and that you&rsquo;d
never want to just use as a random integer (the integer 0 is
special, though, and <br>
gets silently accepted iirc - it&rsquo;s kind of like
&quot;NULL&quot; for pointers). So &quot;gfp_t&quot; or the
&quot;safe endianness&quot; types would be __bitwise: you
can only operate on them by doing <br>
specific operations that know about *that* particular
type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Generally, you want bitwise if
you are looking for type safety. Sparse does not issue these
warnings by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wcast-to-as <br>
Warn about casts which add an address space to a pointer
type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A cast that includes
__attribute__((force)) will suppress this warning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sparse does not issue these
warnings by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wcast-truncate <br>
Warn about casts that truncate constant values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sparse issues these warnings by
default. To turn them off, use -Wno-cast-truncate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wcontext <br>
Warn about potential errors in synchronization or other
delimited contexts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sparse supports several means of
designating functions or statements that delimit contexts,
such as synchronization. Functions with the extended
attribute <br>
__attribute__((context(expression,in_context,out_context))
require the context expression (for instance, a lock) to
have the value in_context (a constant nonnegative
inte&acirc; <br>
ger) when called, and return with the value out_context (a
constant nonnegative integer). For APIs defined via macros,
use the statement form __context__(expres&acirc; <br>
sion,in_value,out_value) in the body of the macro.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With -Wcontext Sparse will warn
when it sees a function change the context without
indicating this with a context attribute, either by
decreasing a context below zero <br>
(such as by releasing a lock without acquiring it), or
returning with a changed context (such as by acquiring a
lock without releasing it). Sparse will also warn about <br>
blocks of code which may potentially execute with different
contexts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sparse issues these warnings by
default. To turn them off, use -Wno-context.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wdecl Warn about any non-static
variable or function definition that has no previous
declaration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Private symbols (functions and
variables) internal to a given source file should use
static, to allow additional compiler optimizations, allow
detection of unused symbols, <br>
and prevent other code from relying on these internal
symbols. Public symbols used by other source files will need
declarations visible to those other source files, such <br>
as in a header file. All declarations should fall into one
of these two categories. Thus, with -Wdecl, Sparse warns
about any symbol definition with neither static nor a <br>
declaration. To fix this warning, declare private symbols
static, and ensure that the files defining public symbols
have the symbol declarations available first (such as <br>
by including the appropriate header file).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sparse issues these warnings by
default. To turn them off, use -Wno-decl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wdeclaration-after-statement
<br>
Warn about declarations that are not at the start of a
block.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These declarations are permitted
in C99 but not in C89.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sparse issues these warnings by
default only when the C dialect is C89 (i.e. -ansi or
-std=c89). To turn them off, use
-Wno-declaration-after-statement.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wdefault-bitfield-sign <br>
Warn about any bitfield with no explicit signedness.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bitfields have no
standard-specified default signedness. (C99 6.7.2) A
bitfield without an explicit signed or unsigned creates a
portability problem for software that <br>
relies on the available range of values. To fix this,
specify the bitfield type as signed or unsigned
explicitly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sparse does not issue these
warnings by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wdesignated-init <br>
Warn about positional initialization of structs marked as
requiring designated initializers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sparse allows an attribute
__attribute__((designated_init)) which marks a struct as
requiring designated initializers. Sparse will warn about
positional initialization of <br>
a struct variable or struct literal of a type that has this
attribute.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Requiring designated
initializers for a particular struct type will insulate code
using that struct type from changes to the layout of the
type, avoiding the need to <br>
change initializers for that type unless they initialize a
removed or incompatibly changed field.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Common examples of this type of
struct include collections of function pointers for the
implementations of a class of related operations, for which
the default NULL for an <br>
unmentioned field in a designated initializer will correctly
indicate the absence of that operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sparse issues these warnings by
default. To turn them off, use -Wno-designated-init.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wdo-while <br>
Warn about do-while loops that do not delimit the loop body
with braces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sparse does not issue these
warnings by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wenum-mismatch <br>
Warn about the use of an expression of an incorrect enum
type when initializing another enum type, assigning to
another enum type, or passing an argument to a function <br>
which expects another enum type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sparse issues these warnings by
default. To turn them off, use -Wno-enum-mismatch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Winit-cstring <br>
Warn about initialization of a char array with a too long
constant C string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the size of the char array
and the length of the string is the same, there is no space
for the last nul char of the string in the array:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">char s[3] = &quot;abc&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the array is used as a byte
array, not as C string, this warning is just noise. However,
if the array is passed to functions dealing with C string
like printf(%s) and <br>
strcmp, it may cause a trouble.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sparse does not issue these
warnings by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wnon-pointer-null <br>
Warn about the use of 0 as a NULL pointer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 has integer type. NULL has
pointer type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sparse issues these warnings by
default. To turn them off, use -Wno-non-pointer-null.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wold-initializer <br>
Warn about the use of the pre-C99 GCC syntax for designated
initializers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C99 provides a standard syntax
for designated fields in struct or union initializers:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">struct structname var = { .field
= value };</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GCC also has an old,
non-standard syntax for designated initializers which
predates C99:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">struct structname var = { field:
value };</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sparse will warn about the use
of GCC&rsquo;s non-standard syntax for designated
initializers. To fix this warning, convert designated
initializers to use the standard C99 syn&acirc; <br>
tax.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sparse issues these warnings by
default. To turn them off, use -Wno-old-initializer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wone-bit-signed-bitfield <br>
Warn about any one-bit signed bitfields.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A one-bit signed bitfield can
only have the values 0 and -1, or with some compilers only
0; this results in unexpected behavior for programs which
expected the ability to <br>
store 0 and 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sparse issues these warnings by
default. To turn them off, use
-Wno-one-bit-signed-bitfield.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wparen-string <br>
Warn about the use of a parenthesized string to initialize
an array.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Standard C syntax does not
permit a parenthesized string as an array initializer. GCC
allows this syntax as an extension. With -Wparen-string,
Sparse will warn about <br>
this syntax.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sparse does not issue these
warnings by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wptr-subtraction-blows <br>
Warn when subtracting two pointers to a type with a
non-power-of-two size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Subtracting two pointers to a
given type gives a difference in terms of the number of
items of that type. To generate this value, compilers will
usually need to divide <br>
the difference by the size of the type, an potentially
expensive operation for sizes other than powers of two.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Code written using pointer
subtraction can often use another approach instead, such as
array indexing with an explicit array index variable, which
may allow compilers to <br>
generate more efficient code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sparse does not issue these
warnings by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wreturn-void <br>
Warn if a function with return type void returns a void
expression.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C99 permits this, and in some
cases this allows for more generic code in macros that use
typeof or take a type as a macro argument. However, some
programs consider this <br>
poor style, and those programs can use -Wreturn-void to get
warnings about it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sparse does not issue these
warnings by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wshadow <br>
Warn when declaring a symbol which shadows a declaration
with the same name in an outer scope.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Such declarations can lead to
error-prone code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sparse does not issue these
warnings by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wsizeof-bool <br>
Warn when checking the sizeof a _Bool.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C99 does not specify the sizeof
a _Bool. gcc uses 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sparse does not issue these
warnings by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wtransparent-union <br>
Warn about any declaration using the GCC extension
__attribute__((transparent_union)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sparse issues these warnings by
default. To turn them off, use -Wno-transparent-union.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wtypesign <br>
Warn when converting a pointer to an integer type into a
pointer to an integer type with different signedness.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sparse does not issue these
warnings by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wundef <br>
Warn about preprocessor conditionals that use the value of
an undefined preprocessor symbol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Standard C (C99 6.10.1) permits
using the value of an undefined preprocessor symbol in
preprocessor conditionals, and specifies it has have a value
of 0. However, this <br>
behavior can lead to subtle errors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sparse does not issue these
warnings by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MISC OPTIONS <br>
-gcc-base-dir dir <br>
Look for compiler-provided system headers in dir/include/
and dir/include-fixed/.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-multiarch-dir dir <br>
Look for system headers in the multiarch subdirectory dir.
The dir name would normally take the form of the
target&rsquo;s normalized GNU triplet. (e.g.
i386-linux-gnu).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OTHER OPTIONS <br>
-ftabstop=WIDTH <br>
Set the distance between tab stops. This helps sparse report
correct column numbers in warnings or errors. If the value
is less than 1 or greater than 100, the option is <br>
ignored. The default is 8.</p>
