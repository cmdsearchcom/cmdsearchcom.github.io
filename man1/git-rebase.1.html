<p>GIT-REBASE(1) Git Manual GIT-REBASE(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
git-rebase - Forward-port local commits to the updated
upstream head</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
git rebase [-i | --interactive] [options] [--exec
&lt;cmd&gt;] [--onto &lt;newbase&gt;] <br>
[&lt;upstream&gt;] [&lt;branch&gt;] <br>
git rebase [-i | --interactive] [options] [--exec
&lt;cmd&gt;] [--onto &lt;newbase&gt;] <br>
--root [&lt;branch&gt;] <br>
git rebase --continue | --skip | --abort | --edit-todo</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
If &lt;branch&gt; is specified, git rebase will perform an
automatic git checkout &lt;branch&gt; before doing anything
else. Otherwise it remains on the current branch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If &lt;upstream&gt; is not
specified, the upstream configured in
branch.&lt;name&gt;.remote and branch.&lt;name&gt;.merge
options will be used; see git-config(1) for details. If you
are currently <br>
not on any branch or if the current branch does not have a
configured upstream, the rebase will abort.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All changes made by commits in
the current branch but that are not in &lt;upstream&gt; are
saved to a temporary area. This is the same set of commits
that would be shown by git log <br>
&lt;upstream&gt;..HEAD (or git log HEAD, if --root is
specified).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The current branch is reset to
&lt;upstream&gt;, or &lt;newbase&gt; if the --onto option
was supplied. This has the exact same effect as git reset
--hard &lt;upstream&gt; (or &lt;newbase&gt;). ORIG_HEAD <br>
is set to point at the tip of the branch before the
reset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The commits that were previously
saved into the temporary area are then reapplied to the
current branch, one by one, in order. Note that any commits
in HEAD which introduce the <br>
same textual changes as a commit in HEAD..&lt;upstream&gt;
are omitted (i.e., a patch already accepted upstream with a
different commit message or timestamp will be skipped).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is possible that a merge
failure will prevent this process from being completely
automatic. You will have to resolve any such merge failure
and run git rebase --continue. <br>
Another option is to bypass the commit that caused the merge
failure with git rebase --skip. To check out the original
&lt;branch&gt; and remove the .git/rebase-apply working
files, <br>
use the command git rebase --abort instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Assume the following history
exists and the current branch is &quot;topic&quot;:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A---B---C topic <br>
/ <br>
D---E---F---G master</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">From this point, the result of
either of the following commands:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">git rebase master <br>
git rebase master topic</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">would be:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A&rsquo;--B&rsquo;--C&rsquo;
topic <br>
/ <br>
D---E---F---G master</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: The latter form is just a
short-hand of git checkout topic followed by git rebase
master. When rebase exits topic will remain the checked-out
branch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the upstream branch already
contains a change you have made (e.g., because you mailed a
patch which was applied upstream), then that commit will be
skipped. For example, <br>
running &acirc;git rebase master&lsquo; on the following
history (in which A&acirc; and A introduce the same set of
changes, but have different committer information):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A---B---C topic <br>
/ <br>
D---E---A&rsquo;---F master</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will result in:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">B&rsquo;---C&rsquo; topic <br>
/ <br>
D---E---A&rsquo;---F master</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here is how you would transplant
a topic branch based on one branch to another, to pretend
that you forked the topic branch from the latter branch,
using rebase --onto.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">First let&acirc;s assume your
topic is based on branch next. For example, a feature
developed in topic depends on some functionality which is
found in next.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o---o---o---o---o master <br>
o---o---o---o---o next <br>
o---o---o topic</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">We want to make topic forked
from branch master; for example, because the functionality
on which topic depends was merged into the more stable
master branch. We want our tree to <br>
look like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o---o---o---o---o master <br>
| | o&rsquo;--o&rsquo;--o&rsquo; topic <br>
o---o---o---o---o next</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">We can get this using the
following command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">git rebase --onto master next
topic</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another example of --onto option
is to rebase part of a branch. If we have the following
situation:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">H---I---J topicB <br>
/ <br>
E---F---G topicA <br>
/ <br>
A---B---C---D master</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">then the command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">git rebase --onto master topicA
topicB</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">would result in:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">H&rsquo;--I&rsquo;--J&rsquo;
topicB <br>
/ <br>
| E---F---G topicA <br>
|/ <br>
A---B---C---D master</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is useful when topicB does
not depend on topicA.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A range of commits could also be
removed with rebase. If we have the following situation:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">E---F---G---H---I---J topicA</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">then the command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">git rebase --onto topicA~5
topicA~3 topicA</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">would result in the removal of
commits F and G:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">E---H&rsquo;---I&rsquo;---J&rsquo;
topicA</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is useful if F and G were
flawed in some way, or should not be part of topicA. Note
that the argument to --onto and the &lt;upstream&gt;
parameter can be any valid commit-ish.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In case of conflict, git rebase
will stop at the first problematic commit and leave conflict
markers in the tree. You can use git diff to locate the
markers (&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;) and make <br>
edits to resolve the conflict. For each file you edit, you
need to tell Git that the conflict has been resolved,
typically this would be done with</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">git add &lt;filename&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After resolving the conflict
manually and updating the index with the desired resolution,
you can continue the rebasing process with</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">git rebase --continue</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alternatively, you can undo the
git rebase with</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">git rebase --abort</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION <br>
rebase.stat <br>
Whether to show a diffstat of what changed upstream since
the last rebase. False by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rebase.autosquash <br>
If set to true enable --autosquash option by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
--onto &lt;newbase&gt; <br>
Starting point at which to create the new commits. If the
--onto option is not specified, the starting point is
&lt;upstream&gt;. May be any valid commit, and not just an
existing <br>
branch name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As a special case, you may use
&quot;A...B&quot; as a shortcut for the merge base of A and
B if there is exactly one merge base. You can leave out at
most one of A and B, in which case <br>
it defaults to HEAD.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;upstream&gt; <br>
Upstream branch to compare against. May be any valid commit,
not just an existing branch name. Defaults to the configured
upstream for the current branch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;branch&gt; <br>
Working branch; defaults to HEAD.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--continue <br>
Restart the rebasing process after having resolved a merge
conflict.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--abort <br>
Abort the rebase operation and reset HEAD to the original
branch. If &lt;branch&gt; was provided when the rebase
operation was started, then HEAD will be reset to
&lt;branch&gt;. <br>
Otherwise HEAD will be reset to where it was when the rebase
operation was started.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--keep-empty <br>
Keep the commits that do not change anything from its
parents in the result.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--skip <br>
Restart the rebasing process by skipping the current
patch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--edit-todo <br>
Edit the todo list during an interactive rebase.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m, --merge <br>
Use merging strategies to rebase. When the recursive
(default) merge strategy is used, this allows rebase to be
aware of renames on the upstream side.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that a rebase merge works
by replaying each commit from the working branch on top of
the &lt;upstream&gt; branch. Because of this, when a merge
conflict happens, the side <br>
reported as ours is the so-far rebased series, starting with
&lt;upstream&gt;, and theirs is the working branch. In other
words, the sides are swapped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s &lt;strategy&gt;,
--strategy=&lt;strategy&gt; <br>
Use the given merge strategy. If there is no -s option git
merge-recursive is used instead. This implies --merge.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Because git rebase replays each
commit from the working branch on top of the
&lt;upstream&gt; branch using the given strategy, using the
ours strategy simply discards all patches <br>
from the &lt;branch&gt;, which makes little sense.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X &lt;strategy-option&gt;,
--strategy-option=&lt;strategy-option&gt; <br>
Pass the &lt;strategy-option&gt; through to the merge
strategy. This implies --merge and, if no strategy has been
specified, -s recursive. Note the reversal of ours and
theirs as <br>
noted above for the -m option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q, --quiet <br>
Be quiet. Implies --no-stat.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
Be verbose. Implies --stat.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--stat <br>
Show a diffstat of what changed upstream since the last
rebase. The diffstat is also controlled by the configuration
option rebase.stat.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --no-stat <br>
Do not show a diffstat as part of the rebase process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-verify <br>
This option bypasses the pre-rebase hook. See also
githooks(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--verify <br>
Allows the pre-rebase hook to run, which is the default.
This option can be used to override --no-verify. See also
githooks(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C&lt;n&gt; <br>
Ensure at least &lt;n&gt; lines of surrounding context match
before and after each change. When fewer lines of
surrounding context exist they all must match. By default no
context <br>
is ever ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, --force-rebase <br>
Force the rebase even if the current branch is a descendant
of the commit you are rebasing onto. Normally
non-interactive rebase will exit with the message
&quot;Current branch is <br>
up to date&quot; in such a situation. Incompatible with the
--interactive option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may find this (or --no-ff
with an interactive rebase) helpful after reverting a topic
branch merge, as this option recreates the topic branch with
fresh commits so it can <br>
be remerged successfully without needing to &quot;revert the
reversion&quot; (see the revert-a-faulty-merge How-To[1] for
details).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ignore-whitespace,
--whitespace=&lt;option&gt; <br>
These flag are passed to the git apply program (see
git-apply(1)) that applies the patch. Incompatible with the
--interactive option.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--committer-date-is-author-date,
--ignore-date <br>
These flags are passed to git am to easily change the dates
of the rebased commits (see git-am(1)). Incompatible with
the --interactive option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i, --interactive <br>
Make a list of the commits which are about to be rebased.
Let the user edit that list before rebasing. This mode can
also be used to split commits (see SPLITTING COMMITS <br>
below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, --preserve-merges <br>
Instead of ignoring merges, try to recreate them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This uses the --interactive
machinery internally, but combining it with the
--interactive option explicitly is generally not a good idea
unless you know what you are doing <br>
(see BUGS below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x &lt;cmd&gt;, --exec
&lt;cmd&gt; <br>
Append &quot;exec &lt;cmd&gt;&quot; after each line creating
a commit in the final history. &lt;cmd&gt; will be
interpreted as one or more shell commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option can only be used
with the --interactive option (see INTERACTIVE MODE
below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may execute several commands
by either using one instance of --exec with several
commands:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">git rebase -i --exec &quot;cmd1
&amp;&amp; cmd2 &amp;&amp; ...&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or by giving more than one
--exec:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">git rebase -i --exec
&quot;cmd1&quot; --exec &quot;cmd2&quot; --exec ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If --autosquash is used,
&quot;exec&quot; lines will not be appended for the
intermediate commits, and will only appear at the end of
each squash/fixup series.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--root <br>
Rebase all commits reachable from &lt;branch&gt;, instead of
limiting them with an &lt;upstream&gt;. This allows you to
rebase the root commit(s) on a branch. When used with
--onto, it <br>
will skip changes already contained in &lt;newbase&gt;
(instead of &lt;upstream&gt;) whereas without --onto it will
operate on every change. When used together with both --onto
and <br>
--preserve-merges, all root commits will be rewritten to
have &lt;newbase&gt; as parent instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--autosquash, --no-autosquash
<br>
When the commit log message begins with &quot;squash!
...&quot; (or &quot;fixup! ...&quot;), and there is a commit
whose title begins with the same ..., automatically modify
the todo list of <br>
rebase -i so that the commit marked for squashing comes
right after the commit to be modified, and change the action
of the moved commit from pick to squash (or fixup).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is only valid when
the --interactive option is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the --autosquash option is
enabled by default using the configuration variable
rebase.autosquash, this option can be used to override and
disable this setting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-ff <br>
With --interactive, cherry-pick all rebased commits instead
of fast-forwarding over the unchanged ones. This ensures
that the entire history of the rebased branch is composed
<br>
of new commits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Without --interactive, this is a
synonym for --force-rebase.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may find this helpful after
reverting a topic branch merge, as this option recreates the
topic branch with fresh commits so it can be remerged
successfully without <br>
needing to &quot;revert the reversion&quot; (see the
revert-a-faulty-merge How-To[1] for details).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MERGE STRATEGIES <br>
The merge mechanism (git-merge and git-pull commands) allows
the backend merge strategies to be chosen with -s option.
Some strategies can also take their own options, which can
<br>
be passed by giving -X&lt;option&gt; arguments to git-merge
and/or git-pull.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">resolve <br>
This can only resolve two heads (i.e. the current branch and
another branch you pulled from) using a 3-way merge
algorithm. It tries to carefully detect criss-cross merge
<br>
ambiguities and is considered generally safe and fast.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">recursive <br>
This can only resolve two heads using a 3-way merge
algorithm. When there is more than one common ancestor that
can be used for 3-way merge, it creates a merged tree of the
<br>
common ancestors and uses that as the reference tree for the
3-way merge. This has been reported to result in fewer merge
conflicts without causing mis-merges by tests done <br>
on actual merge commits taken from Linux 2.6 kernel
development history. Additionally this can detect and handle
merges involving renames. This is the default merge strategy
<br>
when pulling or merging one branch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The recursive strategy can take
the following options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ours <br>
This option forces conflicting hunks to be auto-resolved
cleanly by favoring our version. Changes from the other tree
that do not conflict with our side are reflected to <br>
the merge result. For a binary file, the entire contents are
taken from our side.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This should not be confused with
the ours merge strategy, which does not even look at what
the other tree contains at all. It discards everything the
other tree did, <br>
declaring our history contains all that happened in it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">theirs <br>
This is the opposite of ours.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">patience <br>
With this option, merge-recursive spends a little extra time
to avoid mismerges that sometimes occur due to unimportant
matching lines (e.g., braces from distinct <br>
functions). Use this when the branches to be merged have
diverged wildly. See also git-diff(1)--patience.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">diff-algorithm=[patience|minimal|histogram|myers]
<br>
Tells merge-recursive to use a different diff algorithm,
which can help avoid mismerges that occur due to unimportant
matching lines (such as braces from distinct <br>
functions). See also git-diff(1)--diff-algorithm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ignore-space-change,
ignore-all-space, ignore-space-at-eol <br>
Treats lines with the indicated type of whitespace change as
unchanged for the sake of a three-way merge. Whitespace
changes mixed with other changes to a line are not <br>
ignored. See also git-diff(1)-b, -w, and
--ignore-space-at-eol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If their version
only introduces whitespace changes to a line, our version is
used;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If our version
introduces whitespace changes but their version includes a
substantial change, their version is used;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Otherwise, the
merge proceeds in the usual way.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">renormalize <br>
This runs a virtual check-out and check-in of all three
stages of a file when resolving a three-way merge. This
option is meant to be used when merging branches with <br>
different clean filters or end-of-line normalization rules.
See &quot;Merging branches with differing checkin/checkout
attributes&quot; in gitattributes(5) for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">no-renormalize <br>
Disables the renormalize option. This overrides the
merge.renormalize configuration variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rename-threshold=&lt;n&gt; <br>
Controls the similarity threshold used for rename detection.
See also git-diff(1)-M.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">subtree[=&lt;path&gt;] <br>
This option is a more advanced form of subtree strategy,
where the strategy makes a guess on how two trees must be
shifted to match with each other when merging. Instead, <br>
the specified path is prefixed (or stripped from the
beginning) to make the shape of two trees to match.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">octopus <br>
This resolves cases with more than two heads, but refuses to
do a complex merge that needs manual resolution. It is
primarily meant to be used for bundling topic branch heads
<br>
together. This is the default merge strategy when pulling or
merging more than one branch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ours <br>
This resolves any number of heads, but the resulting tree of
the merge is always that of the current branch head,
effectively ignoring all changes from all other branches. It
<br>
is meant to be used to supersede old development history of
side branches. Note that this is different from the -Xours
option to the recursive merge strategy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">subtree <br>
This is a modified recursive strategy. When merging trees A
and B, if B corresponds to a subtree of A, B is first
adjusted to match the tree structure of A, instead of <br>
reading the trees at the same level. This adjustment is also
done to the common ancestor tree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
You should understand the implications of using git rebase
on a repository that you share. See also RECOVERING FROM
UPSTREAM REBASE below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the git-rebase command is
run, it will first execute a &quot;pre-rebase&quot; hook if
one exists. You can use this hook to do sanity checks and
reject the rebase if it isn&acirc;t <br>
appropriate. Please see the template pre-rebase hook script
for an example.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Upon completion, &lt;branch&gt;
will be the current branch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INTERACTIVE MODE <br>
Rebasing interactively means that you have a chance to edit
the commits which are rebased. You can reorder the commits,
and you can remove them (weeding out bad or otherwise <br>
unwanted patches).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The interactive mode is meant
for this type of workflow:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. have a wonderful idea</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. hack on the code</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. prepare a series for
submission</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. submit</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where point 2. consists of
several instances of</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a) regular use</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. finish something worthy of a
commit</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. commit</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">b) independent fixup</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. realize that something does
not work</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. fix that</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. commit it</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sometimes the thing fixed in
b.2. cannot be amended to the not-quite perfect commit it
fixes, because that commit is buried deeply in a patch
series. That is exactly what <br>
interactive rebase is for: use it after plenty of
&quot;a&quot;s and &quot;b&quot;s, by rearranging and
editing commits, and squashing multiple commits into
one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Start it with the last commit
you want to retain as-is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">git rebase -i
&lt;after-this-commit&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An editor will be fired up with
all the commits in your current branch (ignoring merge
commits), which come after the given commit. You can reorder
the commits in this list to <br>
your heart&acirc;s content, and you can remove them. The
list looks more or less like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pick deadbee The oneline of this
commit <br>
pick fa1afe1 The oneline of the next commit <br>
...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The oneline descriptions are
purely for your pleasure; git rebase will not look at them
but at the commit names (&quot;deadbee&quot; and
&quot;fa1afe1&quot; in this example), so do not delete or
<br>
edit the names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By replacing the command
&quot;pick&quot; with the command &quot;edit&quot;, you can
tell git rebase to stop after applying that commit, so that
you can edit the files and/or the commit message, <br>
amend the commit, and continue rebasing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you just want to edit the
commit message for a commit, replace the command
&quot;pick&quot; with the command &quot;reword&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to fold two or more
commits into one, replace the command &quot;pick&quot; for
the second and subsequent commits with &quot;squash&quot; or
&quot;fixup&quot;. If the commits had different authors,
<br>
the folded commit will be attributed to the author of the
first commit. The suggested commit message for the folded
commit is the concatenation of the commit messages of the
<br>
first commit and of those with the &quot;squash&quot;
command, but omits the commit messages of commits with the
&quot;fixup&quot; command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">git rebase will stop when
&quot;pick&quot; has been replaced with &quot;edit&quot; or
when a command fails due to merge errors. When you are done
editing and/or resolving conflicts you can continue <br>
with git rebase --continue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, if you want to
reorder the last 5 commits, such that what was HEAD~4
becomes the new HEAD. To achieve that, you would call git
rebase like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git rebase -i HEAD~5</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">And move the first patch to the
end of the list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You might want to preserve
merges, if you have a history like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">X <br>
A---M---B <br>
/ <br>
---o---O---P---Q</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Suppose you want to rebase the
side branch starting at &quot;A&quot; to &quot;Q&quot;. Make
sure that the current HEAD is &quot;B&quot;, and call</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git rebase -i -p --onto Q
O</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Reordering and editing commits
usually creates untested intermediate steps. You may want to
check that your history editing did not break anything by
running a test, or at least <br>
recompiling at intermediate points in history by using the
&quot;exec&quot; command (shortcut &quot;x&quot;). You may
do so by creating a todo list like this one:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pick deadbee Implement feature
XXX <br>
fixup f1a5c00 Fix to feature XXX <br>
exec make <br>
pick c0ffeee The oneline of the next commit <br>
edit deadbab The oneline of the commit after <br>
exec cd subdir; make test <br>
...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The interactive rebase will stop
when a command fails (i.e. exits with non-0 status) to give
you an opportunity to fix the problem. You can continue with
git rebase --continue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;exec&quot; command
launches the command in a shell (the one specified in
$SHELL, or the default shell if $SHELL is not set), so you
can use shell features (like &quot;cd&quot;,
&quot;&gt;&quot;, &quot;;&quot; <br>
...). The command is run from the root of the working
tree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git rebase -i --exec
&quot;make test&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command lets you check that
intermediate commits are compilable. The todo list becomes
like that:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pick 5928aea one <br>
exec make test <br>
pick 04d0fda two <br>
exec make test <br>
pick ba46169 three <br>
exec make test <br>
pick f4593f9 four <br>
exec make test</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SPLITTING COMMITS <br>
In interactive mode, you can mark commits with the action
&quot;edit&quot;. However, this does not necessarily mean
that git rebase expects the result of this edit to be
exactly one <br>
commit. Indeed, you can undo the commit, or you can add
other commits. This can be used to split a commit into
two:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Start an
interactive rebase with git rebase -i &lt;commit&gt;^, where
&lt;commit&gt; is the commit you want to split. In fact, any
commit range will do, as long as it contains that <br>
commit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Mark the commit
you want to split with the action &quot;edit&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; When it comes to
editing that commit, execute git reset HEAD^. The effect is
that the HEAD is rewound by one, and the index follows suit.
However, the working tree stays the <br>
same.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Now add the
changes to the index that you want to have in the first
commit. You can use git add (possibly interactively) or git
gui (or both) to do that.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Commit the
now-current index with whatever commit message is
appropriate now.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Repeat the last
two steps until your working tree is clean.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Continue the
rebase with git rebase --continue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are not absolutely sure
that the intermediate revisions are consistent (they
compile, pass the testsuite, etc.) you should use git stash
to stash away the <br>
not-yet-committed changes after each commit, test, and amend
the commit if fixes are necessary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RECOVERING FROM UPSTREAM REBASE
<br>
Rebasing (or any other form of rewriting) a branch that
others have based work on is a bad idea: anyone downstream
of it is forced to manually fix their history. This section
<br>
explains how to do the fix from the downstream&acirc;s point
of view. The real fix, however, would be to avoid rebasing
the upstream in the first place.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To illustrate, suppose you are
in a situation where someone develops a subsystem branch,
and you are working on a topic that is dependent on this
subsystem. You might end up with <br>
a history like the following:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o
master <br>
o---o---o---o---o subsystem <br>
*---*---* topic</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If subsystem is rebased against
master, the following happens:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o
master &nbsp; <br>
o---o---o---o---o
o&rsquo;--o&rsquo;--o&rsquo;--o&rsquo;--o&rsquo; subsystem
<br>
*---*---* topic</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you now continue development
as usual, and eventually merge topic to subsystem, the
commits from subsystem will remain duplicated forever:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o
master &nbsp; <br>
o---o---o---o---o
o&rsquo;--o&rsquo;--o&rsquo;--o&rsquo;--o&rsquo;--M
subsystem &nbsp; <br>
/ <br>
*---*---*-..........-*--* topic</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Such duplicates are generally
frowned upon because they clutter up history, making it
harder to follow. To clean things up, you need to transplant
the commits on topic to the new <br>
subsystem tip, i.e., rebase topic. This becomes a ripple
effect: anyone downstream from topic is forced to rebase
too, and so on!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are two kinds of fixes,
discussed in the following subsections:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Easy case: The changes are
literally the same. <br>
This happens if the subsystem rebase was a simple rebase and
had no conflicts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hard case: The changes are not
the same. <br>
This happens if the subsystem rebase had conflicts, or used
--interactive to omit, edit, squash, or fixup commits; or if
the upstream used one of commit --amend, reset, or <br>
filter-branch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The easy case <br>
Only works if the changes (patch IDs based on the diff
contents) on subsystem are literally the same before and
after the rebase subsystem did.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In that case, the fix is easy
because git rebase knows to skip changes that are already
present in the new upstream. So if you say (assuming
you&acirc;re on topic)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git rebase subsystem</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">you will end up with the fixed
history</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o
master <br>
o&rsquo;--o&rsquo;--o&rsquo;--o&rsquo;--o&rsquo; subsystem
<br>
*---*---* topic</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The hard case <br>
Things get more complicated if the subsystem changes do not
exactly correspond to the ones before the rebase.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note <br>
While an &quot;easy case recovery&quot; sometimes appears to
be successful even in the hard case, it may have unintended
consequences. For example, a commit that was removed via git
<br>
rebase --interactive will be resurrected!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The idea is to manually tell git
rebase &quot;where the old subsystem ended and your topic
began&quot;, that is, what the old merge-base between them
was. You will have to find a way to <br>
name the last commit of the old subsystem, for example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; With the
subsystem reflog: after git fetch, the old tip of subsystem
is at subsystem@{1}. Subsequent fetches will increase the
number. (See git-reflog(1).)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Relative to the
tip of topic: knowing that your topic has three commits, the
old tip of subsystem must be topic~3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can then transplant the old
subsystem..topic to the new tip by saying (for the reflog
case, and assuming you are on topic already):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git rebase --onto subsystem
subsystem@{1}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ripple effect of a
&quot;hard case&quot; recovery is especially bad: everyone
downstream from topic will now have to perform a &quot;hard
case&quot; recovery too!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
The todo list presented by --preserve-merges --interactive
does not represent the topology of the revision graph.
Editing commits and rewording their commit messages should
work <br>
fine, but attempts to reorder commits tend to produce
counterintuitive results.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, an attempt to
rearrange</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 --- 2 --- 3 --- 4 --- 5</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">to</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 --- 2 --- 4 --- 3 --- 5</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">by moving the &quot;pick 4&quot;
line will result in the following history:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3 <br>
/ <br>
1 --- 2 --- 4 --- 5</p>
