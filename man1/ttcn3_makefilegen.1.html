<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ttcn3_makefilegen - Makefile Generator</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ttcn3_makefilegen [ -acdEfglMnpRsSw ] [ -e ETS_name ] [ -o
dir|file ] [ -O file ] [ -z file ] ... TTCN3_module[.ttcn]
... ASN1_module[.asn] ... Testport_name[.cc] ... <br>
or <br>
ttcn3_makefilegen -v</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This manual page is a quick reference for the Makefile
Generator of the TTCN-3 Test Executor. It only summarizes
the meaning of all command line options. For more details
please <br>
consult the Programmer&rsquo;s Technical Reference for TITAN
TTCN-3 Test Executor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The following options are supported (in alphabetical
order):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a Refer to files using absolute
path names in the generated Makefile. By default the
Makefile uses relative path names to access files located
outside the current working <br>
directory of the compiler. Files from the current working
directory are always referenced using only the file name
without any directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Generate a Makefile that is
capable of using pre-compiled C++ and object files from
central directories in order to save disk space and
compilation time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Dump the internal data
structures used for Makefile generation. This option is
mainly useful for debugging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e ETS_name <br>
Sets the name of the target binary program (i.e. the
executable test suite) to ETS_name in the generated
Makefile. If this option is omitted, the name of the first
<br>
TTCN-3 module will be used as default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E Instructs the variant
attribute parser to display warnings instead of errors for
unrecognized/erroneous attributes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Forces the Makefile Generator
to overwrite the output files even if they exist or are
unchanged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g Generates a Makefile that can
be used with GNU make only. The resulting Makefile will be
smaller and less redundant. It exploits the pattern
substitution features of <br>
GNU make, which may cause syntax errors with other versions
of make.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I path Adds the path to the
list of search paths. path must be an absolute path. Used
with the -t option when the referenced projects can not be
found at the projectRela&acirc; <br>
tiveURI location. In that case the tool will try to find the
referenced TPD file using the search paths. The first TPD
file found is taken. If the tpdName attribute is <br>
present in <br>
ReferencedProject then the value of tpdName will be used as
a TPD name during search. However if the tpdName attribute
is missing then the value of the name attribute <br>
is taken with the .tpd suffix and used during the
search.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o dir|file <br>
Write the Makefile to the given directory or file. The
current working directory is the default otherwise. If the
given argument is an existing directory, the gener&acirc;
<br>
ated Makefile will be placed into that directory. Otherwise
the given argument is assumed to be the name of the
generated Makefile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O file Add file to the list of
other files in the generated Makefile without analyzing the
file&rsquo;s contents and suffix. This option can be used to
temporarily exclude some <br>
TTCN-3, ASN.1 or C++ files from the build process, but add
them to the archive created by the command make archive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l Enable dynamic linking. All
files of the project will be compiled with -fPIC and for
each (static) object, a new shared object will be created.
Then, these shared <br>
objects will be linked to the final executable instead of
the (static) objects. It can be used to speed up the linking
phase, in the price of somewhat lower performance <br>
and increased memory usage. It&rsquo;s recommended to use
this flag only in the development phase of the project. This
option is not supported on Windows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M Allows the use of the value
omit in template lists and complemented template lists
(legacy behavior). If set, an omitted field will match a
template list, if the value <br>
omit appears in the list, and it will match a complemented
template list, if omit is not in the list (the ifpresent
attribute can still be used for matching omitted <br>
fields). This also affects the ispresent operation and the
present template restriction accordingly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Activates the debugger and
generates extra code for storing debug information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p Generate Makefile with TTCN-3
preprocessing. All the TTCN-3 source files with the ttcnpp
extension will be preprocessed using the C preprocessor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R Use function test runtime
(TITAN_RUNTIME_2). Generates a Makefile that compiles and
links the source code using the function test runtime.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Generates a Makefile, which
links the executable test suite with the single mode version
of the base library. If this switch is omitted the
executable is built for par&acirc; <br>
allel mode by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S Supresses all makefilegen
warning messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Prints version and license
key information and exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w Suppresses all warning
messages gerenated by TITAN.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z file Enables code coverage
and profiling in the TTCN-3 files listed in the file
argument. The TTCN-3 files in the list must be separated by
new lines and must also appear <br>
among the makefile generator&rsquo;s arguments (this switch
is ignored if the -t option is present).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
TTCN3_DIR <br>
The installation directory where the uncompressed binary
package of TTCN-3 Test Executor can be found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TTCN3_LICENSE_FILE <br>
It shall point to the file (NB: not to its directory) that
contains the personalized license key for the current user
or host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
