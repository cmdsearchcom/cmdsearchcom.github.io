<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ctags - Generate tag files for source code</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ctags [options] [file(s)]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">etags [options] [file(s)]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The ctags and etags programs (hereinafter collectively
referred to as ctags, except where distinguished) generate
an index (or &quot;tag&quot;) file for a variety of language
objects found <br>
in file(s). This tag file allows these items to be quickly
and easily located by a text editor or other utility. A
&quot;tag&quot; signifies a language object for which an
index entry is <br>
available (or, alternatively, the index entry created for
that object).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alternatively, ctags can
generate a cross reference file which lists, in human
readable form, information about the various source objects
found in a set of language files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tag index files are supported by
numerous editors, which allow the user to locate the object
associated with a name appearing in a source file and jump
to the file and line which <br>
defines the name. Those known about at the time of this
release are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Vi(1) and its derivatives (e.g.
Elvis, Vim, Vile, Lemmy), CRiSP, Emacs, FTE (Folding Text
Editor), JED, jEdit, Mined, NEdit (Nirvana Edit), TSE (The
SemWare Editor), <br>
UltraEdit, WorkSpace, X2, Zeus</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ctags is capable of generating
different kinds of tags for each of many different
languages. For a complete list of supported languages, the
names by which they are recognized, <br>
and the kinds of tags which are generated for each, see the
--list-languages and --list-kinds options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SOURCE FILES <br>
Unless the --language-force option is specified, the
language of each source file is automatically selected based
upon a mapping of file names to languages. The mappings in
<br>
effect for each language may be display using the
--list-maps option and may be changed using the --langmap
option. On platforms which support it, if the name of a file
is not <br>
mapped to a language and the file is executable, the first
line of the file is checked to see if the file is a
&quot;#!&quot; script for a recognized language.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, all other files
names are ignored. This permits running ctags on all files
in either a single directory (e.g. &quot;ctags *&quot;), or
on all files in an entire source direc&acirc; <br>
tory tree (e.g. &quot;ctags -R&quot;), since only those
files whose names are mapped to languages will be
scanned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[The reason that .h extensions
are mapped to C++ files rather than C files is because it is
common to use .h extensions in C++, and no harm results in
treating them as C++ <br>
files.]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Despite the wealth of available options, defaults are set so
that ctags is most commonly executed without any options
(e.g. &quot;ctags *&quot;, or &quot;ctags -R&quot;), which
will create a tag <br>
file in the current directory for all recognized source
files. The options described below are provided merely to
allow custom tailoring to meet special needs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that spaces separating the
single-letter options from their parameters are
optional.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note also that the boolean
parameters to the long form options (those beginning with
&quot;--&quot; and that take a &quot;[=yes|no]&quot;
parameter) may be omitted, in which case &quot;=yes&quot; is
implied. <br>
(e.g. --sort is equivalent to --sort=yes). Note further that
&quot;=1&quot; and &quot;=on&quot; are considered synonyms
for &quot;=yes&quot;, and that &quot;=0&quot; and
&quot;=off&quot; are considered synonyms for
&quot;=no&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some options are either ignored
or useful only when used while running in etags mode (see -e
option). Such options will be noted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most options may appear anywhere
on the command line, affecting only those files which follow
the option. A few options, however, must appear before the
first file name and will <br>
be noted as such.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options taking language names
will accept those names in either upper or lower case. See
the --list-languages option for a complete list of the
built-in language names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a Equivalent to --append.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B Use backward searching
patterns (e.g. ?pattern?). [Ignored in etags mode]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e Enable etags mode, which will
create a tag file for use with the Emacs editor.
Alternatively, if ctags is invoked by a name containing the
string &quot;etags&quot; (either by renam&acirc; <br>
ing, or creating a link to, the executable), etags mode will
be enabled. This option must appear before the first file
name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f tagfile <br>
Use the name specified by tagfile for the tag file (default
is &quot;tags&quot;, or &quot;TAGS&quot; when running in
etags mode). If tagfile is specified as &quot;-&quot;, then
the tag file is written to <br>
standard output instead. Ctags will stubbornly refuse to
take orders if tagfile exists and its first line contains
something other than a valid tags line. This will save <br>
your neck if you mistakenly type &quot;ctags -f *.c&quot;,
which would otherwise overwrite your first C file with the
tags generated by the rest! It will also refuse to accept a
<br>
multi-character file name which begins with a
&rsquo;-&rsquo; (dash) character, since this most likely
means that you left out the tag file name and this option
tried to grab the next <br>
option as the file name. If you really want to name your
output tag file &quot;-ugly&quot;, specify it as
&quot;./-ugly&quot;. This option must appear before the
first file name. If this option <br>
is specified more than once, only the last will apply.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F Use forward searching
patterns (e.g. /pattern/) (default). [Ignored in etags
mode]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h list <br>
Specifies a list of file extensions, separated by periods,
which are to be interpreted as include (or header) files. To
indicate files having no extension, use a period not <br>
followed by a non-period character (e.g. &quot;.&quot;,
&quot;..x&quot;, &quot;.x.&quot;). This option only affects
how the scoping of a particular kinds of tags is interpreted
(i.e. whether or not they <br>
are considered as globally visible or visible only within
the file in which they are defined); it does not map the
extension to any particular language. Any tag which is <br>
located in a non-include file and cannot be seen (e.g.
linked to) from another file is considered to have
file-limited (e.g. static) scope. No kind of tag appearing
in an <br>
include file will be considered to have file-limited scope.
If the first character in the list is a plus sign, then the
extensions in the list will be appended to the cur&acirc;
<br>
rent list; otherwise, the list will replace the current
list. See, also, the --file-scope option. The default list
is &quot;.h.H.hh.hpp.hxx.h++.inc.def&quot;. To restore the
default <br>
list, specify -h default. Note that if an extension supplied
to this option is not already mapped to a particular
language (see SOURCE FILES, above), you will also need to
<br>
use either the --langmap or --language-force option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I identifier-list <br>
Specifies a list of identifiers which are to be specially
handled while parsing C and C++ source files. This option is
specifically provided to handle special cases arising <br>
through the use of preprocessor macros. When the identifiers
listed are simple identifiers, these identifiers will be
ignored during parsing of the source files. If an
iden&acirc; <br>
tifier is suffixed with a &rsquo;+&rsquo; character, ctags
will also ignore any parenthesis-enclosed argument list
which may immediately follow the identifier in the source
files. If <br>
two identifiers are separated with the &rsquo;=&rsquo;
character, the first identifiers is replaced by the second
identifiers for parsing purposes. The list of identifiers
may be sup&acirc; <br>
plied directly on the command line or read in from a
separate file. If the first character of identifier-list is
&rsquo;@&rsquo;, &rsquo;.&rsquo; or a pathname separator
(&rsquo;/&rsquo; or &rsquo;&acute;), or the first <br>
two characters specify a drive letter (e.g. &quot;C:&quot;),
the parameter identifier-list will be interpreted as a
filename from which to read a list of identifiers, one per
input <br>
line. Otherwise, identifier-list is a list of identifiers
(or identifier pairs) to be specially handled, each
delimited by a either a comma or by white space (in which
case <br>
the list should be quoted to keep the entire list as one
command line argument). Multiple -I options may be supplied.
To clear the list of ignore identifiers, supply a sin&acirc;
<br>
gle dash (&quot;-&quot;) for identifier-list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This feature is useful when
preprocessor macros are used in such a way that they cause
syntactic confusion due to their presence. Indeed, this is
the best way of working <br>
around a number of problems caused by the presence of
syntax-busting macros in source files (see CAVEATS, below).
Some examples will illustrate this point.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">int foo ARGDECL4(void *, ptr,
long int, nbytes)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the above example, the macro
&quot;ARGDECL4&quot; would be mistakenly interpreted to be
the name of the function instead of the correct name of
&quot;foo&quot;. Specifying -I ARGDECL4 <br>
results in the correct behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/* creates an RCS version string
in module */ <br>
MODULE_VERSION(&quot;$Revision: 690 $&quot;)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the above example the macro
invocation looks too much like a function definition because
it is not followed by a semicolon (indeed, it could even be
followed by a global <br>
variable definition that would look much like a K&amp;R
style function parameter declaration). In fact, this seeming
function definition could possibly even cause the rest of
<br>
the file to be skipped over while trying to complete the
definition. Specifying -I MODULE_VERSION+ would avoid such a
problem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CLASS Example { <br>
// your content here <br>
};</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The example above uses
&quot;CLASS&quot; as a preprocessor macro which expands to
something different for each platform. For instance CLASS
may be defined as &quot;class __declspec(dllex&acirc; <br>
port)&quot; on Win32 platforms and simply &quot;class&quot;
on UNIX. Normally, the absence of the C++ keyword
&quot;class&quot; would cause the source file to be
incorrectly parsed. Correct behav&acirc; <br>
ior can be restored by specifying -I CLASS=class.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L file <br>
Read from file a list of file names for which tags should be
generated. If file is specified as &quot;-&quot;, then file
names are read from standard input. File names read using
<br>
this option are processed following file names appearing on
the command line. Options are also accepted in this input.
If this option is specified more than once, only the <br>
last will apply. Note: file is read in line-oriented mode,
where a new line is the only delimiter and non-trailing
white space is considered significant, in order that file
<br>
names containing spaces may be supplied (however, trailing
white space is stripped from lines); this can affect how
options are parsed if included in the input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Equivalent to
--excmd=number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N Equivalent to
--excmd=pattern.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o tagfile <br>
Equivalent to -f tagfile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R Equivalent to --recurse.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u Equivalent to --sort=no (i.e.
&quot;unsorted&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Equivalent to --verbose.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w This option is silently
ignored for backward-compatibility with the ctags of SVR4
Unix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x Print a tabular,
human-readable cross reference (xref) file to standard
output instead of generating a tag file. The information
contained in the output includes: the tag <br>
name; the kind of tag; the line number, file name, and
source line (with extra white space condensed) of the file
which defines the tag. No tag file is written and all <br>
options affecting tag file output will be ignored. Example
applications for this feature are generating a listing of
all functions located in a source file (e.g. ctags -x <br>
--c-kinds=f file), or generating a list of all externally
visible global variables located in a source file (e.g.
ctags -x --c-kinds=v --file-scope=no file). This option <br>
must appear before the first file name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--append[=yes|no] <br>
Indicates whether tags generated from the specified files
should be appended to those already present in the tag file
or should replace them. This option is off by default. <br>
This option must appear before the first file name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--etags-include=file <br>
Include a reference to file in the tag file. This option may
be specified as many times as desired. This supports
Emacs&rsquo; capability to use a tag file which
&quot;includes&quot; other <br>
tag files. [Available only in etags mode]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--exclude=[pattern] <br>
Add pattern to a list of excluded files and directories.
This option may be specified as many times as desired. For
each file name considered by ctags, each pattern
speci&acirc; <br>
fied using this option will be compared against both the
complete path (e.g. some/path/base.ext) and the base name
(e.g. base.ext) of the file, thus allowing patterns which
<br>
match a given file name irrespective of its path, or match
only a specific path. If appropriate support is available
from the runtime library of your C compiler, then pat&acirc;
<br>
tern may contain the usual shell wildcards (not regular
expressions) common on Unix (be sure to quote the option
parameter to protect the wildcards from being expanded by
<br>
the shell before being passed to ctags; also be aware that
wildcards can match the slash character, &rsquo;/&rsquo;).
You can determine if shell wildcards are available on your
platform <br>
by examining the output of the --version option, which will
include &quot;+wildcards&quot; in the compiled feature list;
otherwise, pattern is matched against file names using a
sim&acirc; <br>
ple textual comparison.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If pattern begins with the
character &rsquo;@&rsquo;, then the rest of the string is
interpreted as a file name from which to read exclusion
patterns, one per line. If pattern is empty, <br>
the list of excluded patterns is cleared. Note that at
program startup, the default exclude list contains
&quot;EIFGEN&quot;, &quot;SCCS&quot;, &quot;RCS&quot;, and
&quot;CVS&quot;, which are names of directories <br>
for which it is generally not desirable to descend while
processing the --recurse option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--excmd=type <br>
Determines the type of EX command used to locate tags in the
source file. [Ignored in etags mode]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The valid values for type
(either the entire word or the first letter is accepted)
are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">number Use only line numbers in
the tag file for locating tags. This has four advantages:
<br>
1. Significantly reduces the size of the resulting tag file.
<br>
2. Eliminates failures to find tags because the line
defining the tag has changed, causing the pattern match to
fail (note that some editors, such as vim, are able <br>
to recover in many such instances). <br>
3. Eliminates finding identical matching, but incorrect,
source lines (see BUGS, below). <br>
4. Retains separate entries in the tag file for lines which
are identical in content. In pattern mode, duplicate entries
are dropped because the search patterns <br>
they generate are identical, making the duplicate entries
useless.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, this option has one
significant drawback: changes to the source files can cause
the line numbers recorded in the tag file to no longer
correspond to the <br>
lines in the source file, causing jumps to some tags to miss
the target definition by one or more lines. Basically, this
option is best used when the source code to <br>
which it is applied is not subject to change. Selecting this
option type causes the following options to be ignored:
-BF.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pattern Use only search patterns
for all tags, rather than the line numbers usually used for
macro definitions. This has the advantage of not referencing
obsolete line num&acirc; <br>
bers when lines have been added or removed since the tag
file was generated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mixed In this mode, patterns are
generally used with a few exceptions. For C, line numbers
are used for macro definition tags. This was the default
format generated by <br>
the original ctags and is, therefore, retained as the
default for this option. For Fortran, line numbers are used
for common blocks because their corresponding <br>
source lines are generally identical, making pattern
searches useless for finding all matches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--extra=[+|-]flags <br>
Specifies whether to include extra tag entries for certain
kinds of information. The parameter flags is a set of
one-letter flags, each representing one kind of extra tag
<br>
entry to include in the tag file. If flags is preceded by by
either the &rsquo;+&rsquo; or &rsquo;-&rsquo; character, the
effect of each flag is added to, or removed from, those
currently enabled; <br>
otherwise the flags replace any current settings. The
meaning of each flag is as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f Include an entry for the base
file name of every source file (e.g. &quot;example.c&quot;),
which addresses the first line of the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">q Include an extra
class-qualified tag entry for each tag which is a member of
a class (for languages for which this information is
extracted; currently C++, Eiffel, <br>
and Java). The actual form of the qualified tag depends upon
the language from which the tag was derived (using a form
that is most natural for how qualified calls <br>
are specified in the language). For C++, it is in the form
&quot;class::member&quot;; for Eiffel and Java, it is in the
form &quot;class.member&quot;. This may allow easier
location of a <br>
specific tags when multiple occurrences of a tag name occur
in the tag file. Note, however, that this could potentially
more than double the size of the tag file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--fields=[+|-]flags <br>
Specifies the available extension fields which are to be
included in the entries of the tag file (see TAG FILE
FORMAT, below, for more information). The parameter flags is
a <br>
set of one-letter flags, each representing one type of
extension field to include, with the following meanings
(disabled by default unless indicated):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a Access (or export) of class
members <br>
f File-restricted scoping [enabled] <br>
i Inheritance information <br>
k Kind of tag as a single letter [enabled] <br>
K Kind of tag as full name <br>
l Language of source file containing tag <br>
m Implementation information <br>
n Line number of tag definition <br>
s Scope of tag definition [enabled] <br>
S Signature of routine (e.g. prototype or parameter list)
<br>
z Include the &quot;kind:&quot; key in kind field <br>
t Type and name of a variable or typedef as
&quot;typeref:&quot; field [enabled]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each letter or group of letters
may be preceded by either &rsquo;+&rsquo; to add it to the
default set, or &rsquo;-&rsquo; to exclude it. In the
absence of any preceding &rsquo;+&rsquo; or &rsquo;-&rsquo;
sign, only those <br>
kinds explicitly listed in flags will be included in the
output (i.e. overriding the default set). This option is
ignored if the option --format=1 has been specified. The
<br>
default value of this option is fkst.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--file-scope[=yes|no] <br>
Indicates whether tags scoped only for a single file (i.e.
tags which cannot be seen outside of the file in which they
are defined, such as &quot;static&quot; tags) should be
included <br>
in the output. See, also, the -h option. This option is
enabled by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--filter[=yes|no] <br>
Causes ctags to behave as a filter, reading source file
names from standard input and printing their tags to
standard output on a file-by-file basis. If --sorted is
enabled, <br>
tags are sorted only within the source file in which they
are defined. File names are read from standard input in
line-oriented input mode (see note for -L option) and only
<br>
after file names listed on the command line or from any file
supplied using the -L option. When this option is enabled,
the options -f, -o, and --totals are ignored. This <br>
option is quite esoteric and is disabled by default. This
option must appear before the first file name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--filter-terminator=string <br>
Specifies a string to print to standard output following the
tags for each file name parsed when the --filter option is
enabled. This may permit an application reading the <br>
output of ctags to determine when the output for each file
is finished. Note that if the file name read is a directory
and --recurse is enabled, this string will be printed <br>
only one once at the end of all tags found for by descending
the directory. This string will always be separated from the
last tag line for the file by its terminating new&acirc;
<br>
line. This option is quite esoteric and is empty by default.
This option must appear before the first file name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--format=level <br>
Change the format of the output tag file. Currently the only
valid values for level are 1 or 2. Level 1 specifies the
original tag file format and level 2 specifies a new <br>
extended format containing extension fields (but in a manner
which retains backward-compatibility with original vi(1)
implementations). The default level is 2. This option <br>
must appear before the first file name. [Ignored in etags
mode]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help <br>
Prints to standard output a detailed usage description, and
then exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--if0[=yes|no] <br>
Indicates a preference as to whether code within an
&quot;#if 0&quot; branch of a preprocessor conditional
should be examined for non-macro tags (macro tags are always
included). <br>
Because the intent of this construct is to disable code, the
default value of this option is no. Note that this indicates
a preference only and does not guarantee skipping <br>
code within an &quot;#if 0&quot; branch, since the fall-back
algorithm used to generate tags when preprocessor
conditionals are too complex follows all branches of a
conditional. This <br>
option is disabled by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--&lt;LANG&gt;-kinds=[+|-]kinds
<br>
Specifies a list of language-specific kinds of tags (or
kinds) to include in the output file for a particular
language, where &lt;LANG&gt; is case-insensitive and is one
of the <br>
built-in language names (see the --list-languages option for
a complete list). The parameter kinds is a group of
one-letter flags designating kinds of tags (particular to
<br>
the language) to either include or exclude from the output.
The specific sets of flags recognized for each language,
their meanings and defaults may be list using the <br>
--list-kinds option. Each letter or group of letters may be
preceded by either &rsquo;+&rsquo; to add it to, or
&rsquo;-&rsquo; to remove it from, the default set. In the
absence of any preceding <br>
&rsquo;+&rsquo; or &rsquo;-&rsquo; sign, only those kinds
explicitly listed in kinds will be included in the output
(i.e. overriding the default for the specified
language).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As an example for the C
language, in order to add prototypes and external variable
declarations to the default set of tag kinds, but exclude
macros, use --c-kinds=+px-d; to <br>
include only tags for functions, use --c-kinds=f.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--langdef=name <br>
Defines a new user-defined language, name, to be parsed with
regular expressions. Once defined, name may be used in other
options taking language names. The typical use of <br>
this option is to first define the language, then map file
names to it using --langmap, then specify regular
expressions using --regex-&lt;LANG&gt; to define how its
tags are <br>
found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--langmap=map[,map[...]] <br>
Controls how file names are mapped to languages (see the
--list-maps option). Each comma-separated map consists of
the language name (either a built-in or user-defined
lan&acirc; <br>
guage), a colon, and a list of file extensions and/or file
name patterns. A file extension is specified by preceding
the extension with a period (e.g. &quot;.c&quot;). A file
name <br>
pattern is specified by enclosing the pattern in parentheses
(e.g. &quot;([Mm]akefile)&quot;). If appropriate support is
available from the runtime library of your C compiler, then
<br>
the file name pattern may contain the usual shell wildcards
common on Unix (be sure to quote the option parameter to
protect the wildcards from being expanded by the shell <br>
before being passed to ctags). You can determine if shell
wildcards are available on your platform by examining the
output of the --version option, which will include <br>
&quot;+wildcards&quot; in the compiled feature list;
otherwise, the file name patterns are matched against file
names using a simple textual comparison. When mapping a file
extension, <br>
it will first be unmapped from any other languages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the first character in a map
is a plus sign, then the extensions and file name patterns
in that map will be appended to the current map for that
language; otherwise, the <br>
map will replace the current map. For example, to specify
that only files with extensions of .c and .x are to be
treated as C language files, use
&quot;--langmap=c:.c.x&quot;; to also <br>
add files with extensions of .j as Java language files,
specify &quot;--langmap=c:.c.x,java:+.j&quot;. To map
makefiles (e.g. files named either &quot;Makefile&quot;,
&quot;makefile&quot;, or having the <br>
extension &quot;.mak&quot;) to a language called
&quot;make&quot;, specify
&quot;--langmap=make:([Mm]akefile).mak&quot;. To map files
having no extension, specify a period not followed by a
non-period <br>
character (e.g. &quot;.&quot;, &quot;..x&quot;,
&quot;.x.&quot;). To clear the mapping for a particular
language (thus inhibiting automatic generation of tags for
that language), specify an empty exten&acirc; <br>
sion list (e.g. &quot;--langmap=fortran:&quot;). To restore
the default language mappings for all a particular language,
supply the keyword &quot;default&quot; for the mapping. To
specify <br>
restore the default language mappings for all languages,
specify &quot;--langmap=default&quot;. Note that file
extensions are tested before file name patterns when
inferring the lan&acirc; <br>
guage of a file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--language-force=language <br>
By default, ctags automatically selects the language of a
source file, ignoring those files whose language cannot be
determined (see SOURCE FILES, above). This option forces
<br>
the specified language (case-insensitive; either built-in or
user-defined) to be used for every supplied file instead of
automatically selecting the language based upon its <br>
extension. In addition, the special value auto indicates
that the language should be automatically selected (which
effectively disables this option).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--languages=[+|-]list <br>
Specifies the languages for which tag generation is enabled,
with list containing a comma-separated list of language
names (case-insensitive; either built-in or user- <br>
defined). If the first language of list is not preceded by
either a &rsquo;+&rsquo; or &rsquo;-&rsquo;, the current
list will be cleared before adding or removing the languages
in list. Until a &rsquo;-&rsquo; <br>
is encountered, each language in the list will be added to
the current list. As either the &rsquo;+&rsquo; or
&rsquo;-&rsquo; is encountered in the list, the languages
following it are added or <br>
removed from the current list, respectively. Thus, it
becomes simple to replace the current list with a new one,
or to add or remove languages from the current list. The
<br>
actual list of files for which tags will be generated
depends upon the language extension mapping in effect (see
the --langmap option). Note that all languages, including
<br>
user-defined languages are enabled unless explicitly
disabled using this option. Language names included in list
may be any built-in language or one previously defined with
<br>
--langdef. The default is &quot;all&quot;, which is also
accepted as a valid argument. See the --list-languages
option for a complete list of the built-in language
names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--license <br>
Prints a summary of the software license to standard output,
and then exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--line-directives[=yes|no] <br>
Specifies whether &quot;#line&quot; directives should be
recognized. These are present in the output of preprocessors
and contain the line number, and possibly the file name, of
the <br>
original source file(s) from which the preprocessor output
file was generated. When enabled, this option will cause
ctags to generate tag entries marked with the file names
<br>
and line numbers of their locations original source file(s),
instead of their actual locations in the preprocessor
output. The actual file names placed into the tag file <br>
will have the same leading path components as the
preprocessor output file, since it is assumed that the
original source files are located relative to the
preprocessor out&acirc; <br>
put file (unless, of course, the #line directive specifies
an absolute path). This option is off by default. Note: This
option is generally only useful when used together <br>
with the --excmd=number (-n) option. Also, you may have to
use either the --langmap or --language-force option if the
extension of the preprocessor output file is not known <br>
to ctags.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--links[=yes|no] <br>
Indicates whether symbolic links (if supported) should be
followed. When disabled, symbolic links are ignored. This
option is on by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--list-kinds[=language|all] <br>
Lists the tag kinds recognized for either the specified
language or all languages, and then exits. Each kind of tag
recorded in the tag file is represented by a one-letter <br>
flag, which is also used to filter the tags placed into the
output through use of the --&lt;LANG&gt;-kinds option. Note
that some languages and/or tag kinds may be implemented <br>
using regular expressions and may not be available if regex
support is not compiled into ctags (see the
--regex-&lt;LANG&gt; option). Each kind listed is enabled
unless followed <br>
by &quot;[off]&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--list-maps[=language|all] <br>
Lists the file extensions and file name patterns which
associate a file name with a language for either the
specified language or all languages, and then exits. See the
<br>
--langmap option, and SOURCE FILES, above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--list-languages <br>
Lists the names of the languages understood by ctags, and
then exits. These language names are case insensitive and
may be used in the --language-force, --languages, <br>
--&lt;LANG&gt;-kinds, and --regex-&lt;LANG&gt; options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--options=file <br>
Read additional options from file. The file should contain
one option per line. As a special case, if --options=NONE is
specified as the first option on the command line, it <br>
will disable the automatic reading of any configuration
options from either a file or the environment (see
FILES).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--recurse[=yes|no] <br>
Recurse into directories encountered in the list of supplied
files. If the list of supplied files is empty and no file
list is specified with the -L option, then the current <br>
directory (i.e. &quot;.&quot;) is assumed. Symbolic links
are followed. If you don&rsquo;t like these behaviors,
either explicitly specify the files or pipe the output of
find(1) into ctags <br>
-L- instead. Note: This option is not supported on all
platforms at present. It is available if the output of the
--help option includes this option. See, also, the <br>
--exclude to limit recursion.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--regex-&lt;LANG&gt;=/regexp/replacement/[kind-spec/][flags]
<br>
The /regexp/replacement/ pair define a regular expression
replacement pattern, similar in style to sed substitution
commands, with which to generate tags from source files <br>
mapped to the named language, &lt;LANG&gt;,
(case-insensitive; either a built-in or user-defined
language). The regular expression, regexp, defines an
extended regular expression <br>
(roughly that used by egrep(1)), which is used to locate a
single source line containing a tag and may specify tab
characters using . When a matching line is found, a tag <br>
will be generated for the name defined by replacement, which
generally will contain the special back-references 1 through
9 to refer to matching sub-expression groups <br>
within regexp. The &rsquo;/&rsquo; separator characters
shown in the parameter to the option can actually be
replaced by any character. Note that whichever separator
character is used <br>
will have to be escaped with a backslash (&rsquo;&acute;)
character wherever it is used in the parameter as something
other than a separator. The regular expression defined by
this <br>
option is added to the current list of regular expressions
for the specified language unless the parameter is omitted,
in which case the current list is cleared.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unless modified by flags, regexp
is interpreted as a Posix extended regular expression. The
replacement should expand for all matching lines to a
non-empty string of charac&acirc; <br>
ters, or a warning message will be reported. An optional
kind specifier for tags matching regexp may follow
replacement, which will determine what kind of tag is
reported in <br>
the &quot;kind&quot; extension field (see TAG FILE FORMAT,
below). The full form of kind-spec is in the form of a
single letter, a comma, a name (without spaces), a comma, a
descrip&acirc; <br>
tion, followed by a separator, which specify the short and
long forms of the kind value and its textual description
(displayed using --list-kinds). Either the kind name <br>
and/or the description may be omitted. If kind-spec is
omitted, it defaults to &quot;r,regex&quot;. Finally, flags
are one or more single-letter characters having the
following effect <br>
upon the interpretation of regexp:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">b The pattern is interpreted as
a Posix basic regular expression.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">e The pattern is interpreted as
a Posix extended regular expression (default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">i The regular expression is to
be applied in a case-insensitive manner.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that this option is
available only if ctags was compiled with support for
regular expressions, which depends upon your platform. You
can determine if support for regu&acirc; <br>
lar expressions is compiled in by examining the output of
the --version option, which will include &quot;+regex&quot;
in the compiled feature list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For more information on the
regular expressions used by ctags, see either the regex(5,7)
man page, or the GNU info documentation for regex (e.g.
&quot;info regex&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--sort[=yes|no|foldcase] <br>
Indicates whether the tag file should be sorted on the tag
name (default is yes). Note that the original vi(1) required
sorted tags. The foldcase value specifies case <br>
insensitive (or case-folded) sorting. Fast binary searches
of tag files sorted with case-folding will require special
support from tools using tag files, such as that found <br>
in the ctags readtags library, or Vim version 6.2 or higher
(using &quot;set ignorecase&quot;). This option must appear
before the first file name. [Ignored in etags mode]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--tag-relative[=yes|no] <br>
Indicates that the file paths recorded in the tag file
should be relative to the directory containing the tag file,
rather than relative to the current directory, unless the
<br>
files supplied on the command line are specified with
absolute paths. This option must appear before the first
file name. The default is yes when running in etags mode
(see <br>
the -e option), no otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--totals[=yes|no] <br>
Prints statistics about the source files read and the tag
file written during the current invocation of ctags. This
option is off by default. This option must appear before
<br>
the first file name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--verbose[=yes|no] <br>
Enable verbose mode. This prints out information on option
processing and a brief message describing what action is
being taken for each file considered by ctags. Normally,
<br>
ctags does not read command line arguments until after
options are read from the configuration files (see FILES,
below) and the CTAGS environment variable. However, if this
<br>
option is the first argument on the command line, it will
take effect before any options are read from these sources.
The default is no.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Prints a version identifier for ctags to standard output,
and then exits. This is guaranteed to always contain the
string &quot;Exuberant Ctags&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERATIONAL DETAILS <br>
As ctags considers each file name in turn, it tries to
determine the language of the file by applying the following
three tests in order: if the file extension has been mapped
to <br>
a language, if the file name matches a shell pattern mapped
to a language, and finally if the file is executable and its
first line specifies an interpreter using the Unix-style
<br>
&quot;#!&quot; specification (if supported on the platform).
If a language was identified, the file is opened and then
the appropriate language parser is called to operate on the
currently <br>
open file. The parser parses through the file and adds an
entry to the tag file for each language object it is written
to handle. See TAG FILE FORMAT, below, for details on these
<br>
entries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This implementation of ctags
imposes no formatting requirements on C code as do legacy
implementations. Older implementations of ctags tended to
rely upon certain formatting <br>
assumptions in order to help it resolve coding dilemmas
caused by preprocessor conditionals.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In general, ctags tries to be
smart about conditional preprocessor directives. If a
preprocessor conditional is encountered within a statement
which defines a tag, ctags follows <br>
only the first branch of that conditional (except in the
special case of &quot;#if 0&quot;, in which case it follows
only the last branch). The reason for this is that failing
to pursue <br>
only one branch can result in ambiguous syntax, as in the
following example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#ifdef TWO_ALTERNATIVES <br>
struct { <br>
#else <br>
union { <br>
#endif <br>
short a; <br>
long b; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Both branches cannot be
followed, or braces become unbalanced and ctags would be
unable to make sense of the syntax.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the application of this
heuristic fails to properly parse a file, generally due to
complicated and inconsistent pairing within the
conditionals, ctags will retry the file <br>
using a different heuristic which does not selectively
follow conditional preprocessor branches, but instead falls
back to relying upon a closing brace (&quot;}&quot;) in
column 1 as indi&acirc; <br>
cating the end of a block once any brace imbalance results
from following a #if conditional branch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ctags will also try to specially
handle arguments lists enclosed in double sets of
parentheses in order to accept the following conditional
construct:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">extern void foo __ARGS((int one,
char two));</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any name immediately preceding
the &quot;((&quot; will be automatically ignored and the
previous name will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C++ operator definitions are
specially handled. In order for consistency with all types
of operators (overloaded and conversion), the operator name
in the tag file will always be <br>
preceded by the string &quot;operator &quot; (i.e. even if
the actual operator definition was written as
&quot;operator&lt;&lt;&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After creating or appending to
the tag file, it is sorted by the tag name, removing
identical tag lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TAG FILE FORMAT <br>
When not running in etags mode, each entry in the tag file
consists of a separate line, each looking like this in the
most general case:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">tag_name&lt;TAB&gt;file_name&lt;TAB&gt;ex_cmd;&quot;&lt;TAB&gt;extension_fields</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The fields and separators of
these lines are specified as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. tag name <br>
2. single tab character <br>
3. name of the file in which the object associated with the
tag is located <br>
4. single tab character <br>
5. EX command used to locate the tag within the file;
generally a search pattern (either /pattern/ or ?pattern?)
or line number (see --excmd). Tag file format 2 (see
--for&acirc; <br>
mat) extends this EX command under certain circumstances to
include a set of extension fields (described below) embedded
in an EX comment immediately appended to the EX <br>
command, which leaves it backward-compatible with original
vi(1) implementations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A few special tags are written
into the tag file for internal purposes. These tags are
composed in such a way that they always sort to the top of
the file. Therefore, the first <br>
two characters of these tags are used a magic number to
detect a tag file for purposes of determining whether a
valid tag file is being overwritten rather than a source
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the name of each
source file will be recorded in the tag file exactly as it
appears on the command line. Therefore, if the path you
specified on the command line was <br>
relative to the current directory, then it will be recorded
in that same manner in the tag file. See, however, the
--tag-relative option for how this behavior can be
modified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Extension fields are
tab-separated key-value pairs appended to the end of the EX
command as a comment, as described above. These key value
pairs appear in the general form <br>
&quot;key:value&quot;. Their presence in the lines of the
tag file are controlled by the --fields option. The possible
keys and the meaning of their values are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">access Indicates the visibility
of this class member, where value is specific to the
language.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file Indicates that the tag has
file-limited visibility. This key has no corresponding
value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kind Indicates the type, or
kind, of tag. Its value is either one of the corresponding
one-letter flags described under the various
--&lt;LANG&gt;-kinds options above, or a full <br>
name. It is permitted (and is, in fact, the default) for the
key portion of this field to be omitted. The optional
behaviors are controlled with the --fields option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">implementation <br>
When present, this indicates a limited implementation
(abstract vs. concrete) of a routine or class, where value
is specific to the language (&quot;virtual&quot; or
&quot;pure vir&acirc; <br>
tual&quot; for C++; &quot;abstract&quot; for Java).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">inherits When present, value. is
a comma-separated list of classes from which this class is
derived (i.e. inherits from).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">signature When present, value is
a language-dependent representation of the signature of a
routine. A routine signature in its complete form specifies
the return type of a rou&acirc; <br>
tine and its formal argument list. This extension field is
presently supported only for C-based languages and does not
include the return type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition, information on the
scope of the tag definition may be available, with the key
portion equal to some language-dependent construct name and
its value the name declared <br>
for that construct in the program. This scope entry
indicates the scope in which the tag was found. For example,
a tag generated for a C structure member would have a scope
look&acirc; <br>
ing like &quot;struct:myStruct&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOW TO USE WITH VI <br>
Vi will, by default, expect a tag file by the name
&quot;tags&quot; in the current directory. Once the tag file
is built, the following commands exercise the tag indexing
feature:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vi -t tag Start vi and position
the cursor at the file and line where &quot;tag&quot; is
defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">:ta tag Find a tag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ctrl-] Find the tag under the
cursor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ctrl-T Return to previous
location before jump to tag (not widely implemented).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOW TO USE WITH GNU EMACS <br>
Emacs will, by default, expect a tag file by the name
&quot;TAGS&quot; in the current directory. Once the tag file
is built, the following commands exercise the tag indexing
feature:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">M-x visit-tags-table &lt;RET&gt;
FILE &lt;RET&gt; <br>
Select the tag file, &quot;FILE&quot;, to use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">M-. [TAG] &lt;RET&gt; <br>
Find the first definition of TAG. The default tag is the
identifier under the cursor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">M-* Pop back to where you
previously invoked &quot;M-.&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C-u M-. Find the next definition
for the last tag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For more commands, see the Tags
topic in the Emacs info document.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOW TO USE WITH NEDIT <br>
NEdit version 5.1 and later can handle the new extended tag
file format (see --format). To make NEdit use the tag file,
select &quot;File-&gt;Load Tags File&quot;. To jump to the
definition <br>
for a tag, highlight the word, the press Ctrl-D. NEdit 5.1
can can read multiple tag files from different directories.
Setting the X resource nedit.tagFile to the name of a tag
<br>
file instructs NEdit to automatically load that tag file at
startup time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CAVEATS <br>
Because ctags is neither a preprocessor nor a compiler, use
of preprocessor macros can fool ctags into either missing
tags or improperly generating inappropriate tags. Although
<br>
ctags has been designed to handle certain common cases, this
is the single biggest cause of reported problems. In
particular, the use of preprocessor constructs which alter
the <br>
textual syntax of C can fool ctags. You can work around many
such problems by using the -I option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that since ctags generates
patterns for locating tags (see the --excmd option), it is
entirely possible that the wrong line may be found by your
editor if there exists <br>
another source line which is identical to the line
containing the tag. The following example demonstrates this
condition:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">int variable;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/* ... */ <br>
void foo(variable) <br>
int variable; <br>
{ <br>
/* ... */ <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Depending upon which editor you
use and where in the code you happen to be, it is possible
that the search pattern may locate the local parameter
declaration in foo() before it <br>
finds the actual global variable definition, since the lines
(and therefore their search patterns are identical). This
can be avoided by use of the --excmd=n option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Ctags has more options than ls(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When parsing a C++ member
function definition (e.g. &quot;className::function&quot;),
ctags cannot determine whether the scope specifier is a
class name or a namespace specifier and always <br>
lists it as a class name in the scope portion of the
extension fields. Also, if a C++ function is defined outside
of the class declaration (the usual case), the access
specifica&acirc; <br>
tion (i.e. public, protected, or private) and implementation
information (e.g. virtual, pure virtual) contained in the
function declaration are not known when the tag is
gener&acirc; <br>
ated for the function definition. It will, however be
available for prototypes (e.g --c++-kinds=+p).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">No qualified tags are generated
for language objects inherited into a class.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
CTAGS If this environment variable exists, it will be
expected to contain a set of default options which are read
when ctags starts, after the configuration files listed in
<br>
FILES, below, are read, but before any command line options
are read. Options appearing on the command line will
override options specified in this variable. Only options
<br>
will be read from this variable. Note that all white space
in this variable is considered a separator, making it
impossible to pass an option parameter containing an <br>
embedded space. If this is a problem, use a configuration
file instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ETAGS Similar to the CTAGS
variable above, this variable, if found, will be read when
etags starts. If this variable is not found, etags will try
to use CTAGS instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TMPDIR On Unix-like hosts where
mkstemp() is available, the value of this variable specifies
the directory in which to place temporary files. This can be
useful if the size of a <br>
temporary file becomes too large to fit on the partition
holding the default temporary directory defined at
compilation time. ctags creates temporary files only if <br>
either (1) an emacs-style tag file is being generated, (2)
the tag file is being sent to standard output, or (3) the
program was compiled to use an internal sort algo&acirc;
<br>
rithm to sort the tag files instead of the the sort utility
of the operating system. If the sort utility of the
operating system is being used, it will generally observe
<br>
this variable also. Note that if ctags is setuid, the value
of TMPDIR will be ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/ctags.cnf (on MSDOS, MSWindows only) <br>
/etc/ctags.conf <br>
/usr/local/etc/ctags.conf <br>
$HOME/.ctags <br>
$HOME/ctags.cnf (on MSDOS, MSWindows only) <br>
.ctags <br>
ctags.cnf (on MSDOS, MSWindows only) <br>
If any of these configuration files exist, each will be
expected to contain a set of default options which are read
in the order listed when ctags starts, but before the <br>
CTAGS environment variable is read or any command line
options are read. This makes it possible to set up
site-wide, personal or project-level defaults. It is
possible to <br>
compile ctags to read an additional configuration file
before any of those shown above, which will be indicated if
the output produced by the --version option lists the <br>
&quot;custom-conf&quot; feature. Options appearing in the
CTAGS environment variable or on the command line will
override options specified in these files. Only options will
be read <br>
from these files. Note that the option files are read in
line-oriented mode in which spaces are significant (since
shell quoting is not possible). Each line of the file is
<br>
read as one command line parameter (as if it were quoted
with single quotes). Therefore, use new lines to indicate
separate command-line arguments.</p>
