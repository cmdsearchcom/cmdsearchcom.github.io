<p>DH_ADA_LIBRARY(1) General Commands Manual
DH_ADA_LIBRARY(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
dh_ada_library - help packaging Ada libraries for Debian</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
dh_ada_library [debhelper options] [[variable=value ...]
project.gpr] ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
dh_ada_library is a debhelper program that handles some
common tasks in packaging libraries written in the Ada
programming language.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each project.gpr argument
designates a GNAT project file building a shared library
provided by the source package. Since using environment
variables in such projects is common <br>
practice, a list of variable assignments may be provided
before each project.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dh_ada_library reads each
project file and extracts the following information from it:
library name, imported projects, source directories, library
directory, object directory <br>
(containing ALI files) and linker options (both
Leading_Library_Options and Library_Options). Then it parses
debian/control to check that three package names exist
conforming to <br>
the Coexistence Not Allowed naming scheme described in the
Debian Policy for Ada and extracts the ALI files version
(aliversion)) and the shared library version (soversion).
<br>
Then, dh_ada_library processes each of the three packages as
follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Runtime library package <br>
dh_ada_library installs the shared library (mode 644) into
the package then, if debian/control mentions a -dbg package,
runs package then runs dh_strip with options storing its
<br>
debugging information into the -dbg package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the shared library declares
its stack executable, dh_ada_library generates a lintian
override for the runtime library package about GNAT using
trampolines for exception han&acirc; <br>
dling. dh_lintian is run first so that it will not overwrite
the override file later.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Debugging symbols (-dbg) package
<br>
The file /usr/share/doc/dh-ada-policy/README.Debian
describes how to provide the same service with less
efforts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If debian/control ments a -dbg
package, the ada:Depends, ada:Recommends, ada:Suggests
substitution variables receive values reflecting that the
-dbg package depends on the <br>
library package, recommends the -dev package and suggests
the gnat package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Versions &lt;= 5.3 used to
replace the documentation directory with a symbolic link to
the one in the runtime library package, but usage has shown
that linking directories caused <br>
upgrade problems. If a binary package built with such a
version has been released, the source package should add
maintainer scripts as described in
https://wiki.debian.org/Miss&acirc; <br>
ingCopyrightFile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Development package (-dev) <br>
First, dh_ada_library installs the usual development
symbolic link (*.so-&gt; *.so.soversion), ALI files (mode
444) and sources (mode 644) into the -dev package. Languages
other <br>
than Ada listed in the project file are taken into account,
whether they have been previously dealt with by gprbuild, or
ignored by gnatmake and compiled separately. Then it <br>
looks for a file named libLIBRARY_NAME.a (the static
library) in the current directory or its subdirectories and
installs this file (mode 644) into the -dev package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A second project file, intended
for use by programs linking against the library, is
generated and installed into the -dev package. The Linker
package of the new project inherits <br>
any -l or -L linker options from Leading_Library_Options and
Library_Options attributes of the build project file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each renaming exception is
transmitted to the generated project.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dh_ada_library runs dh_strip
before installing the static library so that the latter
keeps its debugging information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ada:Depends substitution
variable receives a value reflecting that the package
depends on gnat, gnat-X.Y and the library package. For each
imported library project recog&acirc; <br>
nized, either as already processed or installed on the build
system by dpkg-query, a dependency is added into ada:Depends
and the generated project is added the corresponding <br>
with line. In the case of an already processed project
within the same source package, the dependency mandates an
exact binary:Version, ensuring that all static libraries are
<br>
compiled with compatible options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REMARKS <br>
This program does not belong to the debhelper suite. To
activate it, please run the dh sequencer with the --with
ada-library option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Library_Version project
attribute is purposedly ignored. Instead, the soname is
guessed from the library package name. For projects needing
an external variable definition <br>
to set this attribute, any arbitrary value may be given.
This will often allow the maintainer to use a simple
debian/ada_libraries file instead of a debhelper override or
an <br>
environment variable exportation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Both libraries and ALI files are
installed into /usr/lib/DEB_HOST_MULTIARCH, the project and
sources into /usr/share/ada/adainclude. This implies that
the -dev package cannot be <br>
declared Multi-Arch: same as the content of the project (and
maybe of generated sources) will vary across
architectures.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
debian/ada_libraries <br>
Projects and variables, in addition to those in the command
line if called directly from debian/rules. Line breaks are
considered as normal spaces. This may change in <br>
the future and it is recommended to put exactly one
affectation or project on each line. Any line starting with
a dash will be ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Common debhelper command line options and environment
variables are recognized.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
