dh_ada_library - help packaging Ada libraries for Debian
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<b>dh_ada_library</b> [<i>debhelper options</i>] [[<i>variable=value</i> ...]
  <i>project.gpr</i>]<i> ...</i>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>dh_ada_library</b> is a debhelper program that handles some common tasks in
  packaging libraries written in the Ada programming language.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Each <i>project.gpr</i> argument designates a GNAT project file building a
  shared library provided by the source package. Since using environment
  variables in such projects is common practice, a list of variable assignments
  may be provided before each project.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>dh_ada_library</b> reads each project file and extracts the following
  information from it: library name, imported projects, source directories,
  library directory, object directory (containing ALI files) and linker options
  (both <i>Leading_Library_Options</i> and <i>Library_Options</i>). Then it
  parses <i>debian/control</i> to check that three package names exist
  conforming to the Coexistence Not Allowed naming scheme described in the
  <b>Debian Policy for Ada</b> and extracts the ALI files version (
  <i>aliversion</i>)) and the shared library version ( <i>soversion</i>). Then,
  <b>dh_ada_library</b> processes each of the three packages as follows:
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Runtime_library_package"><a class="selflink" href="#Runtime_library_package">Runtime
  library package</a></h2>
<b>dh_ada_library</b> installs the shared library (mode 644) into the package
  then, if <i>debian/control</i> mentions a -dbg package, runs package then runs
  <b>dh_strip</b> with options storing its debugging information into the -dbg
  package.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the shared library declares its stack executable, <b>dh_ada_library</b>
  generates a lintian override for the runtime library package about GNAT using
  trampolines for exception handling. <b>dh_lintian</b> is run first so that it
  will not overwrite the override file later.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Debugging_symbols_(-dbg)_package"><a class="selflink" href="#Debugging_symbols_(-dbg)_package">Debugging
  symbols (-dbg) package</a></h2>
The file <i>/usr/share/doc/dh-ada-policy/README.Debian</i> describes how to
  provide the same service with less efforts.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If <i>debian/control</i> ments a -dbg package, the <i>ada:Depends</i>,
  <i>ada:Recommends</i>, <i>ada:Suggests</i> substitution variables receive
  values reflecting that the -dbg package depends on the library package,
  recommends the -dev package and suggests the <i>gnat</i> package.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Versions &lt;= 5.3 used to replace the documentation directory with a symbolic
  link to the one in the runtime library package, but usage has shown that
  linking directories caused upgrade problems. If a binary package built with
  such a version has been released, the source package should add maintainer
  scripts as described in https://wiki.debian.org/MissingCopyrightFile.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Development_package_(-dev)"><a class="selflink" href="#Development_package_(-dev)">Development
  package (-dev)</a></h2>
First, <b>dh_ada_library</b> installs the usual development symbolic link
  (*.so-&gt; *.so. <i>soversion</i>), ALI files (mode 444) and sources (mode
  644) into the -dev package. Languages other than Ada listed in the project
  file are taken into account, whether they have been previously dealt with by
  <i>gprbuild</i>, or ignored by <i>gnatmake</i> and compiled separately. Then
  it looks for a file named <i>lib</i>LIBRARY_NAME<i>.a</i> (the static library)
  in the current directory or its subdirectories and installs this file (mode
  644) into the -dev package.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A second project file, intended for use by programs linking against the library,
  is generated and installed into the -dev package. The <i>Linker</i> package of
  the new project inherits any <b>-l</b> or <b>-L</b> linker options from
  <i>Leading_Library_Options</i> and <i>Library_Options</i> attributes of the
  build project file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Each renaming exception is transmitted to the generated project.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>dh_ada_library</b> runs <b>dh_strip</b> before installing the static library
  so that the latter keeps its debugging information.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <i>ada:Depends</i> substitution variable receives a value reflecting that
  the package depends on <i>gnat</i>, <i>gnat-X.Y</i> and the library package.
  For each imported library project recognized, either as already processed or
  installed on the build system by <b>dpkg-query</b>, a dependency is added into
  <i>ada:Depends</i> and the generated project is added the corresponding
  <i>with</i> line. In the case of an already processed project within the same
  source package, the dependency mandates an exact <i>binary:Version</i>,
  ensuring that all static libraries are compiled with compatible options.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="REMARKS"><a class="selflink" href="#REMARKS">REMARKS</a></h1>
This program does not belong to the debhelper suite. To activate it, please run
  the <b>dh</b> sequencer with the <i>--with&#x00A0;ada-library</i> option.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <i>Library_Version</i> project attribute is purposedly ignored. Instead, the
  soname is guessed from the library package name. For projects needing an
  external variable definition to set this attribute, any arbitrary value may be
  given. This will often allow the maintainer to use a simple
  <i>debian/ada_libraries</i> file instead of a debhelper override or an
  environment variable exportation.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Both libraries and ALI files are installed into
  <i>/usr/lib/</i>DEB_HOST_MULTIARCH, the project and sources into
  <i>/usr/share/ada/adainclude</i>. This implies that the -dev package cannot be
  declared <i>Multi-Arch: same</i> as the content of the project (and maybe of
  generated sources) will vary across architectures.
