zzuf -h | --help <br>
zzuf -V | --version</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
zzuf is a transparent application input fuzzer. It works by
intercepting file and network operations and changing random
bits in the program&rsquo;s input. zzuf&rsquo;s behaviour is
deter&acirc; <br>
ministic, making it easy to reproduce bugs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USAGE <br>
zzuf will run an application specified on its command line,
one or several times, with optional arguments, and will
report the application&rsquo;s relevant behaviour on the
standard <br>
error channel, eg:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zzuf cat /dev/zero</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Flags found after the
application name are considered arguments for the
application, not for zzuf. For instance, -v below is an
argument for cat:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zzuf -B 1000 cat -v
/dev/zero</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When no program is specified,
zzuf simply fuzzes the standard input, as if the cat utility
had been called:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zzuf &lt; /dev/zero</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Generic program information <br>
-h, --help <br>
Display a short help message and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
Output version information and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Operating mode <br>
-f, --fuzzing=mode <br>
Select how the input is fuzzed. Valid values for mode
are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xor randomly set and unset
bits</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set only set bits</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unset only unset bits</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default value for mode is
xor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O, --opmode=mode <br>
Use operating mode mode. Valid values for mode are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">preload <br>
override functions by preloading libzzuf into the executable
using the system&rsquo;s dynamic linker</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">copy temporarily copy files that
need to be fuzzed</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default value for mode is
preload. copy is useful on platforms that do not support
dynamic linker injection, for instance when fuzzing a Cocoa
application on Mac OS X.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --seed=seed <br>
-s, --seed=start: <br>
-s, --seed=start:stop <br>
Specify the random seed to use for fuzzing, or a range of
random seeds. Running zzuf twice with the same random seed
will fuzz the files exactly the same way, even with a <br>
different target application. The purpose of this is to use
simple utilities such as cat or cp to generate a file that
causes the target application to crash.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a range is specified, zzuf
will run the application several times, each time with a
different seed, and report the behaviour of each run. If no
&acirc;stop&acirc; is specified <br>
after &acirc;:&acirc;, zzuf will increment the seed value
indefinitely.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, --ratio=ratio <br>
-r, --ratio=min:max <br>
Specify the proportion of bits that will be randomly fuzzed.
A value of 0 will not fuzz anything. A value of 0.05 will
fuzz 5% of the open files&rsquo; bits. A value of 1.0 or
<br>
more will fuzz all the bytes, theoretically making the input
files undiscernible from random data. The default fuzzing
ratio is 0.004 (fuzz 0.4% of the files&rsquo; bits).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A range can also be specified.
When doing so, zzuf will pick ratio values from the
interval. The choice is deterministic and only depends on
the interval bounds and the <br>
current seed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A, --autoinc <br>
Increment random seed each time a new file is opened. This
is only required if one instance of the application is
expected to open the same file several times and you want
<br>
to test a different seed each time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Output <br>
-d, --debug <br>
Activate the display of debug messages. Can be specified
multiple times for increased verbosity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q, --quiet <br>
Hide the output of the fuzzed application. This is useful if
the application is very verbose but only its exit code or
signaled status is really useful to you.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
Print information during the run, such as the current seed,
what processes get run, their exit status, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m, --md5 <br>
Instead of displaying the program&rsquo;s standard output,
just print its MD5 digest to zzuf&rsquo;s standard output.
The standard error channel is left untouched. See also the
-X <br>
flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X, --hex <br>
Convert the fuzzed program&rsquo;s standard output to
hexadecimal. The standard error channel is left untouched.
See also the -m flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Process control <br>
-B, --max-bytes=n <br>
Automatically stop after n bytes have been output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This either terminates child
processes that output more than n bytes on the standard
output and standard error channels, or stop reading from
standard input if no program <br>
is being fuzzed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is useful to detect
infinite loops. See also the -U and -T flags.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C, --max-crashes=n <br>
Stop forking when at least n children have crashed. The
default value is 1, meaning zzuf will stop as soon as one
child has crashed. A value of 0 tells zzuf to never
stop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that zzuf will not kill any
remaining children once n is reached. To ensure that
processes do not last forever, see the -U flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A process is considered to have
crashed if any signal (such as, but not limited to, SIGSEGV)
caused it to exit. If the -x flag is used, this will also
include processes <br>
that exit with a non-zero status.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is only relevant if
the -s flag is used with a range argument. See also the -t
flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D, --delay=delay <br>
Do not launch more than one process every delay seconds.
This option should be used together with -j to avoid fork
bombs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-j, --jobs=jobs <br>
Specify the number of simultaneous children that can be run.
By default, zzuf only launches one process at a time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is only relevant if
the -s flag is used with a range argument. See also the -D
flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M, --max-memory=mebibytes <br>
Specify the maximum amount of memory, in mebibytes (1 MiB =
1,048,576 bytes), that children are allowed to allocate.
This is useful to detect infinite loops that eat up a <br>
lot of memory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The value should be set
reasonably high so as not to interfer with normal program
operation. By default, it is set to 1024 MiB in order to
avoid accidental excessive swap&acirc; <br>
ping. To disable the limitation, set the maximum memory
usage to -1 instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zzuf uses the setrlimit() call
to set memory usage limitations and relies on the operating
system&rsquo;s ability to enforce such limitations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S, --signal <br>
Prevent children from installing signal handlers for signals
that usually cause coredumps. These signals are SIGABRT,
SIGFPE, SIGILL, SIGQUIT, SIGSEGV, SIGTRAP and, if <br>
available on the running platform, SIGSYS, SIGEMT, SIGBUS,
SIGXCPU and SIGXFSZ. Instead of calling the signal handler,
the application will simply crash. If you do not <br>
want core dumps, you should set appropriate limits with the
limit coredumpsize command. See your shell&rsquo;s
documentation on how to set such limits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t, --max-time=n <br>
Stop forking after n seconds. By default, zzuf runs until
the end of the seed range is reached.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that zzuf will not kill any
remaining children once n is reached. To ensure that
processes do not last forever, see the -U flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is only relevant if
the -s flag is used with a range argument. See also the -C
flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T, --max-cputime=n <br>
Automatically terminate child processes that use more than n
seconds of CPU time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zzuf uses the setrlimit() call
to set CPU usage limitations and relies on the operating
system&rsquo;s ability to enforce such limitations. If the
system sends SIGXCPU signals <br>
and the application catches that signal, it will receive a
SIGKILL signal after 5 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is more accurate than -U
because the behaviour should be independent from the system
load, but it does not detect processes stuck into infinite
select() calls because <br>
they use very little CPU time. See also the -B and -U
flags.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U, --max-usertime=n <br>
Automatically terminate child processes that run for more
than n seconds. This is useful to detect infinite loops or
processes stuck in other situations. See also the -B <br>
and -T flags.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x, --check-exit <br>
Report processes that exit with a non-zero status. By
default only processes that crash due to a signal are
reported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Filtering <br>
-a, --allow=list <br>
Only fuzz network input for IPs in list, a comma-separated
list of IP addresses. If the list starts with !, the flag
meaning is reversed and all addresses are fuzzed <br>
except the ones in the list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As of now, this flag only
understands INET (IPv4) addresses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option requires network
fuzzing to be activated using -n.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b, --bytes=ranges <br>
Restrict fuzzing to bytes whose offsets in the file are
within ranges.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Range values start at zero and
are inclusive. Use dashes between range values and commas
between ranges. If the right-hand part of a range is
ommited, it means end of <br>
file. For instance, to restrict fuzzing to bytes 0, 3, 4, 5
and all bytes after offset 31, use
&acirc;-b0,3-5,31-&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is useful to
preserve file headers or corrupt only a specific portion of
a file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --cmdline <br>
Only fuzz files whose name is specified in the target
application&rsquo;s command line. This is mostly a shortcut
to avoid specifying the argument twice:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zzuf -c cat file.txt</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">has the same effect as</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zzuf -I &rsquo;^file.txt$&rsquo;
cat file.txt</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See the -I flag for more
information on restricting fuzzing to specific files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E, --exclude=regex <br>
Do not fuzz files whose name matches the regex regular
expression. This option supersedes anything that is
specified by the -I flag. Use this for instance if you are
<br>
unsure of what files your application is going to read and
do not want it to fuzz files in the /etc directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Multiple -E flags can be
specified, in which case files matching any one of the
regular expressions will be ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i, --stdin <br>
Fuzz the application&rsquo;s standard input. By default zzuf
only fuzzes files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I, --include=regex <br>
Only fuzz files whose name matches the regex regular
expression. Use this for instance if your application reads
configuration files at startup and you only want specific
<br>
files to be fuzzed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Multiple -I flags can be
specified, in which case files matching any one of the
regular expressions will be fuzzed. See also the -c
flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, --list=list <br>
Cherry-pick the list of file descriptors that get fuzzed.
The Nth descriptor will really be fuzzed only if N is in
list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Values start at 1 and ranges are
inclusive. Use dashes between values and commas between
ranges. If the right-hand part of a range is ommited, it
means all subsequent file <br>
descriptors. For instance, to restrict fuzzing to the first
opened descriptor and all descriptors starting from the
10th, use &acirc;-l1,10-&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that this option only
affects file descriptors that would otherwise be fuzzed.
Even if 10 write-only descriptors are opened at the
beginning of the program, only the <br>
next descriptor with a read flag will be the first one
considered by the -l flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P, --protect=list <br>
Protect a list of characters so that if they appear in input
data that would normally be fuzzed, they are left unmodified
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Characters in list can be
expressed verbatim or through escape sequences. The
sequences interpreted by zzuf are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">new line</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">return</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tabulation</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">the byte whose octal value is
NNN</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">the byte whose hexadecimal value
is NN</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">\ backslash (&acirc;&acirc;)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can use &acirc;-&acirc; to
specify ranges. For instance, to protect all bytes from
&acirc; 01&acirc; to &acirc;/&acirc;, use &acirc;-P &rsquo;
01-/&rsquo;&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The statistical outcome of this
option should not be overlooked: if characters are
protected, the effect of the &acirc;-r&acirc; flag will vary
depending on the data being fuzzed. For <br>
instance, asking to fuzz 1% of input bits (-r0.01) and to
protect lowercase characters (-P a-z) will result in an
actual average fuzzing ratio of 0.9% with truly random <br>
data, 0.3% with random ASCII data and 0.2% with standard
English text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See also the -R flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R, --refuse=list <br>
Refuse a list of characters by not fuzzing bytes that would
otherwise be changed to a character that is in list. This
does not prevent characters from appearing in the <br>
output if the original byte was already in list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See the -P option for a
description of list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Network <br>
-n, --network <br>
Fuzz the application&rsquo;s network input. By default zzuf
only fuzzes files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Only INET (IPv4) and INET6
(IPv6) connections are fuzzed. Other protocol families are
not yet supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, --ports=ranges <br>
Only fuzz network ports that are in ranges. By default zzuf
fuzzes all ports. The port considered is the listening port
if the socket is listening and the destination port <br>
if the socket is connecting, because most of the time the
source port cannot be predicted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Range values start at zero and
are inclusive. Use dashes between range values and commas
between ranges. If the right-hand part of a range is
ommited, it means end of <br>
file. For instance, to restrict fuzzing to the HTTP and
HTTPS ports and to all unprivileged ports, use
&acirc;-p80,443,1024-&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option requires network
fuzzing to be activated using -n.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
Exit status is zero if no child process crashed. If one or
several children crashed, zzuf exits with status 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Fuzz the input of the cat program using default
settings:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zzuf cat /etc/motd</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fuzz 1% of the input bits of the
cat program using seed 94324:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zzuf -s94324 -r0.01 cat
/etc/motd</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fuzz the input of the cat
program but do not fuzz newline characters and prevent
non-ASCII characters from appearing in the output:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zzuf -P &rsquo;0 -R
&rsquo;0-ff-&rsquo; cat /etc/motd</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fuzz the input of the convert
program, using file foo.jpeg as the original input and
excluding .xml files from fuzzing (because convert will also
open its own XML configuration <br>
files and we do not want zzuf to fuzz them):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zzuf -E &rsquo;.xml$&rsquo;
convert foo.jpeg -format tga /dev/null</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fuzz the input of VLC, using
file movie.avi as the original input and restricting fuzzing
to filenames that appear on the command line (-c), then
generate fuzzy-movie.avi which <br>
is a file that can be read by VLC to reproduce the same
behaviour without using zzuf:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zzuf -c -s87423 -r0.01 vlc
movie.avi <br>
zzuf -c -s87423 -r0.01 &lt;movie.avi &gt;fuzzy-movie.avi
<br>
vlc fuzzy-movie.avi</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fuzz between 0.1% and 2% of
MPlayer&rsquo;s input bits (-r0.001:0.02) with seeds 0 to
9999 (-s0:10000), preserving the AVI 4-byte header by
restricting fuzzing to offsets after 4 <br>
(-b4-), disabling its standard output messages (-q),
launching up to five simultaneous child processes (-j5) but
waiting at least half a second between launches (-D0.5),
killing <br>
MPlayer if it takes more than one minute to read the file
(-T60) and disabling its SIGSEGV signal handler (-S):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zzuf -c -r0.001:0.02 -s0:10000
-b4- -q -j5 -D0.5 -T60 -S mplayer -benchmark -vo null -fps
1000 movie.avi</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A more advanced VLC fuzzing
example, stopping only at the first crash:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zzuf -j4 -vqc -r0.000001:0.01
-s0: vlc -v -I dummy movie.avi --sout
&rsquo;#transcode{acodec=s16l,vcodec=I420}:dummy&rsquo;
vlc:quit</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Create an HTML-like file that
loads 200 times the same hello.jpg image and open it in
Firefox&acirc;&cent; in auto-increment mode (-A):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">seq -f &rsquo;&lt;img
src=&quot;hello.jpg#%g&quot;&gt;&rsquo; 1 200 &gt;
hello.html <br>
(or: jot -w &rsquo;&lt;img
src=&quot;hello.jpg#%d&quot;&gt;&rsquo; 200 1 &gt;
hello.html) <br>
zzuf -A -I &rsquo;hello[.]jpg&rsquo; -r0.001 firefox
hello.html</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Run a simple HTTP redirector on
the local host using socat and corrupt each network
connection (-n) in a different way (-A) after one megabyte
of data was received on it <br>
(-b1000000-):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zzuf -n -A -b1000000- socat
TCP4-LISTEN:8080,reuseaddr,fork TCP4:192.168.1.42:80</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Browse the intarweb (-n) using
Firefox&acirc;&cent; without fuzzing local files (-E.) or
non-HTTP connections (-p80,8010,8080), preserving the
beginning of the data sent with each HTTP <br>
response (-b4000-) and using another seed on each connection
(-A):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zzuf -r 0.0001 -n -E.
-p80,8010,8080 -b4000- -A firefox</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RESTRICTIONS <br>
Due to zzuf using shared object preloading (LD_PRELOAD,
_RLD_LIST, DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES, etc.) to run its child
processes, it will fail in the presence of any mechanism
that <br>
disables preloading. For instance setuid root binaries will
not be fuzzed when run as an unprivileged user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For the same reasons, zzuf will
also not work with statically linked binaries. Bear this in
mind when using zzuf on the OpenBSD platform, where cat, cp
and dd are static bina&acirc; <br>
ries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Though best efforts are made,
identical behaviour for different versions of zzuf is not
guaranteed. The reproducibility for subsequent calls on
different operating systems and <br>
with different target programs is only guaranteed when the
same version of zzuf is being used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
zzuf probably does not behave correctly with 64-bit
offsets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is not yet possible to insert
or drop bytes from the input, to fuzz according to the file
format, to swap bytes, etc. More advanced fuzzing methods
are planned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As of now, zzuf does not really
support multithreaded applications. The behaviour with
multithreaded applications where more than one thread does
file descriptor operations is <br>
undefined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY <br>
zzuf started its life in 2002 as the streamfucker tool, a
small multimedia stream corrupter used to find bugs in the
VLC media player.</p>
