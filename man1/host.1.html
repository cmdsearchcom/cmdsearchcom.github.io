<p>HOST(1) BIND9 HOST(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
host - DNS lookup utility</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
host [-aCdlnrsTwv] [-c class] [-N ndots] [-R number] [-t
type] [-W wait] [-m flag] [-4] [-6] {name} [server]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
host is a simple utility for performing DNS lookups. It is
normally used to convert names to IP addresses and vice
versa. When no arguments or options are given, host prints a
<br>
short summary of its command line arguments and options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">name is the domain name that is
to be looked up. It can also be a dotted-decimal IPv4
address or a colon-delimited IPv6 address, in which case
host will by default perform a <br>
reverse lookup for that address. server is an optional
argument which is either the name or IP address of the name
server that host should query instead of the server or
servers <br>
listed in /etc/resolv.conf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -a (all) option is
equivalent to setting the -v option and asking host to make
a query of type ANY.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the -C option is used, host
will attempt to display the SOA records for zone name from
all the listed authoritative name servers for that zone. The
list of name servers is <br>
defined by the NS records that are found for the zone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -c option instructs to make
a DNS query of class class. This can be used to lookup
Hesiod or Chaosnet class resource records. The default class
is IN (Internet).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Verbose output is generated by
host when the -d or -v option is used. The two options are
equivalent. They have been provided for backwards
compatibility. In previous versions, <br>
the -d option switched on debugging traces and -v enabled
verbose output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">List mode is selected by the -l
option. This makes host perform a zone transfer for zone
name. Transfer the zone printing out the NS, PTR and address
records (A/AAAA). If <br>
combined with -a all records will be printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -i option specifies that
reverse lookups of IPv6 addresses should use the IP6.INT
domain as defined in RFC1886. The default is to use
IP6.ARPA.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -N option sets the number of
dots that have to be in name for it to be considered
absolute. The default value is that defined using the ndots
statement in /etc/resolv.conf, <br>
or 1 if no ndots statement is present. Names with fewer dots
are interpreted as relative names and will be searched for
in the domains listed in the search or domain directive in
<br>
/etc/resolv.conf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The number of UDP retries for a
lookup can be changed with the -R option. number indicates
how many times host will repeat a query that does not get
answered. The default number <br>
of retries is 1. If number is negative or zero, the number
of retries will default to 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Non-recursive queries can be
made via the -r option. Setting this option clears the RD
&acirc; recursion desired &acirc; bit in the query which
host makes. This should mean that the name <br>
server receiving the query will not attempt to resolve name.
The -r option enables host to mimic the behavior of a name
server by making non-recursive queries and expecting to <br>
receive answers to those queries that are usually referrals
to other name servers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, host uses UDP when
making queries. The -T option makes it use a TCP connection
when querying the name server. TCP will be automatically
selected for queries that <br>
require it, such as zone transfer (AXFR) requests.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -4 option forces host to
only use IPv4 query transport. The -6 option forces host to
only use IPv6 query transport.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -t option is used to select
the query type. type can be any recognized query type:
CNAME, NS, SOA, SIG, KEY, AXFR, etc. When no query type is
specified, host automatically <br>
selects an appropriate query type. By default, it looks for
A, AAAA, and MX records, but if the -C option was given,
queries will be made for SOA records, and if name is a <br>
dotted-decimal IPv4 address or colon-delimited IPv6 address,
host will query for PTR records. If a query type of IXFR is
chosen the starting serial number can be specified by <br>
appending an equal followed by the starting serial number
(e.g. -t IXFR=12345678).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The time to wait for a reply can
be controlled through the -W and -w options. The -W option
makes host wait for wait seconds. If wait is less than one,
the wait interval is set <br>
to one second. When the -w option is used, host will
effectively wait forever for a reply. The time to wait for a
response will be set to the number of seconds given by the
<br>
hardware&rsquo;s maximum value for an integer quantity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -s option tells host not to
send the query to the next nameserver if any server responds
with a SERVFAIL response, which is the reverse of normal
stub resolver behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -m can be used to set the
memory usage debugging flags record, usage and trace.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IDN SUPPORT <br>
If host has been built with IDN (internationalized domain
name) support, it can accept and display non-ASCII domain
names. host appropriately converts character encoding of
<br>
domain name before sending a request to DNS server or
displaying a reply from the server. If you&rsquo;d like to
turn off the IDN support for some reason, defines the
IDN_DISABLE <br>
environment variable. The IDN support is disabled if the
variable is set when host runs.</p>
