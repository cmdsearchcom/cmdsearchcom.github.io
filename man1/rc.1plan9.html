<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
rc, cd, eval, exec, exit, flag, rfork, shift, wait, whatis,
., ~ - command language</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
rc [ -srdiIlxepvV ] [ -c command ] [ file [ arg ... ]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Rc is the Plan 9 shell. It executes command lines read from
a terminal or a file or, with the -c flag, from rc&rsquo;s
argument list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Command Lines <br>
A command line is a sequence of commands, separated by
ampersands or semicolons (&amp; or ;), terminated by a
newline. The commands are executed in sequence from left to
right. Rc <br>
does not wait for a command followed by &amp; to finish
executing before starting the following command. Whenever a
command followed by &amp; is executed, its process id is
assigned to <br>
the rc variable $apid. Whenever a command not followed by
&amp; exits or is terminated, the rc variable $status gets
the process&rsquo;s wait message (see wait(3)); it will be
the null <br>
string if the command was successful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A long command line may be
continued on subsequent lines by typing a backslash (
followed by a newline. This sequence is treated as though it
were a blank. Backslash is not <br>
otherwise a special character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A number-sign (#) and any
following characters up to (but not including) the next
newline are ignored, except in quotation marks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Simple Commands <br>
A simple command is a sequence of arguments interspersed
with I/O redirections. If the first argument is the name of
an rc function or of one of rc&rsquo;s built-in commands, it
is <br>
executed by rc. Otherwise if the name starts with a slash
(/), it must be the path name of the program to be executed.
Names containing no initial slash are searched for in a <br>
list of directory names stored in $path. The first
executable file of the given name found in a directory in
$path is the program to be executed. To be executable, the
user <br>
must have execute permission (see stat(3)) and the file must
be either an executable binary for the current
machine&rsquo;s CPU type, or a shell script. Shell scripts
begin with a <br>
line containing the full path name of a shell (usually
/bin/rc), prefixed by</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first word of a simple
command cannot be a keyword unless it is quoted or otherwise
disguised. The keywords are <br>
for in while if not switch fn ~ ! @</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Arguments and Variables <br>
A number of constructions may be used where rc&rsquo;s
syntax requires an argument to appear. In many cases a
construction&rsquo;s value will be a list of arguments
rather than a single <br>
string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The simplest kind of argument is
the unquoted word: a sequence of one or more characters none
of which is a blank, tab, newline, or any of the following:
<br>
# ; &amp; | ^ $ = &lsquo; &rsquo; { } ( ) &lt; &gt; <br>
An unquoted word that contains any of the characters * ? [
is a pattern for matching against file names. The character
* matches any sequence of characters, ? matches any
sin&acirc; <br>
gle character, and [class] matches any character in the
class. If the first character of class is ~, the class is
complemented. The class may also contain pairs of characters
<br>
separated by -, standing for all characters lexically
between the two. The character / must appear explicitly in a
pattern, as must the first character of the path name
compo&acirc; <br>
nents . and ... A pattern is replaced by a list of
arguments, one for each path name matched, except that a
pattern matching no names is not replaced by the empty list,
but <br>
rather stands for itself. Pattern matching is done after all
other operations. Thus, <br>
x=/tmp echo $x^/*.c <br>
matches /tmp/*.c, rather than matching /*.c and then
prefixing /tmp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A quoted word is a sequence of
characters surrounded by single quotes (&rsquo;). A single
quote is represented in a quoted word by a pair of quotes
(&rsquo;&rsquo;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each of the following is an
argument. <br>
(arguments) <br>
The value of a sequence of arguments enclosed in parentheses
is a list comprising the members of each element of the
sequence. Argument lists have no recursive structure, <br>
although their syntax may suggest it. The following are
entirely equivalent: <br>
echo hi there everybody <br>
((echo) (hi there) everybody) <br>
$argument <br>
$argument(subscript) <br>
The argument after the $ is the name of a variable whose
value is substituted. Multiple levels of indirection are
possible, but of questionable utility. Variable values <br>
are lists of strings. If argument is a number n, the value
is the nth element of $*, unless $* doesn&rsquo;t have n
elements, in which case the value is empty. If argument is
<br>
followed by a parenthesized list of subscripts, the value
substituted is a list composed of the requested elements
(origin 1). The parenthesis must follow the variable <br>
name with no spaces. Subscripts can also take the form m-n
or m- to indicate a sequence of elements. Assignments to
variables are described below. <br>
$#argument <br>
The value is the number of elements in the named variable. A
variable never assigned a value has zero elements. <br>
$&quot;argument <br>
The value is a single string containing the components of
the named variable separated by spaces. A variable with zero
elements yields the empty string. <br>
&lsquo;{command} <br>
rc executes the command and reads its standard output,
splitting it into a list of arguments, using characters in
$ifs as separators. If $ifs is not otherwise set, its <br>
value is &rsquo; 0. <br>
&lt;{command} <br>
&gt;{command} <br>
The command is executed asynchronously with its standard
output or standard input connected to a pipe. The value of
the argument is the name of a file referring to the <br>
other end of the pipe. This allows the construction of
non-linear pipelines. For example, the following runs two
commands old and new and uses cmp to compare their
out&acirc; <br>
puts <br>
cmp &lt;{old} &lt;{new} <br>
argument^argument <br>
The ^ operator concatenates its two operands. If the two
operands have the same number of components, they are
concatenated pairwise. If not, then one operand must have
<br>
one component, and the other must be non-empty, and
concatenation is distributive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Free Carets <br>
In most circumstances, rc will insert the ^ operator
automatically between words that are not separated by white
space. Whenever one of $ &rsquo; &lsquo; follows a quoted or
unquoted word <br>
or an unquoted word follows a quoted word with no
intervening blanks or tabs, a ^ is inserted between the two.
If an unquoted word immediately follows a $ and contains a
charac&acirc; <br>
ter other than an alphanumeric, underscore, or *, a ^ is
inserted before the first such character. Thus</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cc -$flags $stem.c</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">is equivalent to</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cc -^$flags $stem^.c</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">I/O Redirections <br>
The sequence &gt;file redirects the standard output file
(file descriptor 1, normally the terminal) to the named
file; &gt;&gt;file appends standard output to the file. The
standard <br>
input file (file descriptor 0, also normally the terminal)
may be redirected from a file by the sequence &lt;file, or
from an inline &lsquo;here document&rsquo; by the sequence
&lt;&lt;eof-marker. <br>
The contents of a here document are lines of text taken from
the command input stream up to a line containing nothing but
the eof-marker, which may be either a quoted or unquoted
<br>
word. If eof-marker is unquoted, variable names of the form
$word have their values substituted from rc&rsquo;s
environment. If $word is followed by a caret (^), the caret
is <br>
deleted. If eof-marker is quoted, no substitution
occurs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Redirections may be applied to a
file-descriptor other than standard input or output by
qualifying the redirection operator with a number in square
brackets. For example, the <br>
diagnostic output (file descriptor 2) may be redirected by
writing cc junk.c &gt;[2]junk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A file descriptor may be
redirected to an already open descriptor by writing
&gt;[fd0=fd1] or &lt;[fd0=fd1]. Fd1 is a previously opened
file descriptor and fd0 becomes a new copy (in <br>
the sense of dup(3)) of it. A file descriptor may be closed
by writing &gt;[fd0=] or &lt;[fd0=].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Redirections are executed from
left to right. Therefore, cc junk.c &gt;/dev/null &gt;[2=1]
and cc junk.c &gt;[2=1] &gt;/dev/null have different
effects: the first puts standard output in <br>
/dev/null and then puts diagnostic output in the same place,
where the second directs diagnostic output to the terminal
and sends standard output to /dev/null.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Compound Commands <br>
A pair of commands separated by a pipe operator (|) is a
command. The standard output of the left command is sent
through a pipe to the standard input of the right command.
The <br>
pipe operator may be decorated to use different file
descriptors. |[fd] connects the output end of the pipe to
file descriptor fd rather than 1. |[fd0=fd1] connects output
to <br>
fd1 of the left command and input to fd0 of the right
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A pair of commands separated by
&amp;&amp; or || is a command. In either case, the left
command is executed and its exit status examined. If the
operator is &amp;&amp; the right command is <br>
executed if the left command&rsquo;s status is null. ||
causes the right command to be executed if the left
command&rsquo;s status is non-null.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The exit status of a command may
be inverted (non-null is changed to null, null is changed to
non-null) by preceding it with a !.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The | operator has highest
precedence, and is left-associative (i.e. binds tighter to
the left than the right). ! has intermediate precedence, and
&amp;&amp; and || have the lowest <br>
precedence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The unary @ operator, with
precedence equal to !, causes its operand to be executed in
a subshell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each of the following is a
command. <br>
if ( list ) command <br>
A list is a sequence of commands, separated by &amp;, ;, or
newline. It is executed and if its exit status is null, the
command is executed. <br>
if not command <br>
The immediately preceding command must have been if(list)
command. If its condition was non-zero, the command is
executed. <br>
for(name in arguments) command <br>
for(name) command <br>
The command is executed once for each argument with that
argument assigned to name. If the argument list is omitted,
$* is used. <br>
while(list) command <br>
The list is executed repeatedly until its exit status is
non-null. Each time it returns null status, the command is
executed. An empty list is taken to give null status. <br>
switch(argument){list} <br>
The list is searched for simple commands beginning with the
word case. (The search is only at the &lsquo;top
level&rsquo; of the list. That is, cases in nested
constructs are not <br>
found.) Argument is matched against each word following case
using the pattern-matching algorithm described above, except
that / and the first characters of . and .. <br>
need not be matched explicitly. When a match is found,
commands in the list are executed up to the next following
case command (at the top level) or the closing brace. <br>
{list} <br>
Braces serve to alter the grouping of commands implied by
operator priorities. The body is a sequence of commands
separated by &amp;, ;, or newline. <br>
fn name{list} <br>
fn name <br>
The first form defines a function with the given name.
Subsequently, whenever a command whose first argument is
name is encountered, the current value of the remainder of
<br>
the command&rsquo;s argument list will be assigned to $*,
after saving its current value, and rc will execute the
list. The second form removes name&rsquo;s function
definition. <br>
fn note{list} <br>
fn note <br>
A function with a special name will be called when rc
receives a corresponding note; see notify(3). The valid note
names (and corresponding notes) are sighup (hangup), <br>
sigint (interrupt), sigalrm (alarm), and sigfpe (floating
point trap). By default rc exits on receiving any signal,
except when run interactively, in which case inter&acirc;
<br>
rupts and quits normally cause rc to stop whatever
it&rsquo;s doing and start reading a new command. The second
form causes rc to handle a signal in the default manner. Rc
<br>
recognizes an artificial note, sigexit, which occurs when rc
is about to finish executing. <br>
name=argument command <br>
Any command may be preceded by a sequence of assignments
interspersed with redirections. The assignments remain in
effect until the end of the command, unless the command <br>
is empty (i.e. the assignments stand alone), in which case
they are effective until rescinded by later assignments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Built-in Commands <br>
These commands are executed internally by rc, usually
because their execution changes or depends on rc&rsquo;s
internal state. <br>
. file ... <br>
Execute commands from file. $* is set for the duration to
the remainder of the argument list following file. File is
searched for using $path. <br>
builtin command ... <br>
Execute command as usual except that any function named
command is ignored in favor of the built-in meaning. <br>
cd [dir] <br>
Change the current directory to dir. The default argument is
$home. dir is searched for in each of the directories
mentioned in $cdpath. <br>
eval [arg ...] <br>
The arguments are concatenated separated by spaces into a
single string, read as input to rc, and executed. <br>
exec [command ...] <br>
This instance of rc replaces itself with the given
(non-built-in) command. <br>
flag f [+-] <br>
Either set (+), clear (-), or test (neither + nor -) the
flag f, where f is a single character, one of the command
line flags (see Invocation, below). <br>
exit [status] <br>
Exit with the given exit status. If none is given, the
current value of $status is used. <br>
rfork [nNeEsfFm] <br>
Become a new process group using rfork(flags) where flags is
composed of the bitwise OR of the rfork flags specified by
the option letters (see fork(2)). If no flags are <br>
given, they default to ens. The flags and their meanings
are: n is RFNAMEG; N is RFCNAMEG; e is RFENVG; E is RFCENVG;
s is RFNOTEG; f is RFFDG; F is RFCFDG; and m is <br>
RFNOMNT. <br>
shift [n] <br>
Delete the first n (default 1) elements of $*. <br>
wait [pid] <br>
Wait for the process with the given pid to exit. If no pid
is given, all outstanding processes are waited for. <br>
whatis name ... <br>
Print the value of each name in a form suitable for input to
rc. The output is an assignment to any variable, the
definition of any function, a call to builtin for any <br>
built-in command, or the completed pathname of any
executable file. <br>
~ subject pattern ... <br>
The subject is matched against each pattern in sequence. If
it matches any pattern, $status is set to zero. Otherwise,
$status is set to one. Patterns are the same as <br>
for file name matching, except that / and the first
character of . and .. need not be matched explicitly. The
patterns are not subjected to file name matching before <br>
the ~ command is executed, so they need not be enclosed in
quotation marks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Environment <br>
The environment is a list of strings made available to
executing binaries by the kernel. Rc creates an environment
entry for each variable whose value is non-empty, and for
each <br>
function. The string for a variable entry has the
variable&rsquo;s name followed by = and its value. If the
value has more than one component, these are separated by
SOH (001) char&acirc; <br>
acters. The string for a function is just the rc input that
defines the function. The name of a function in the
environment is the function name preceded by</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When rc starts executing it
reads variable and function definitions from its
environment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Special Variables <br>
The following variables are set or used by rc. <br>
$* Set to rc&rsquo;s argument list during initialization.
Whenever a . command or a function is executed, the current
value is saved and $* receives the new argument list. The
<br>
saved value is restored on completion of the . or function.
<br>
$apid Whenever a process is started asynchronously with
&amp;, $apid is set to its process id. <br>
$home The default directory for cd. <br>
$ifs The input field separators used in backquote
substitutions. If $ifs is not set in rc&rsquo;s environment,
it is initialized to blank, tab and newline. <br>
$path The search path used to find commands and input files
for the . command. If not set in the environment, it is
initialized by parsing the $PATH variable (as in sh(1)) <br>
or by path=(. /bin). The variables $path and $PATH are
maintained together: changes to one will be reflected in the
other. <br>
$pid Set during initialization to rc&rsquo;s process id.
<br>
$prompt When rc is run interactively, the first component of
$prompt is printed before reading each command. The second
component is printed whenever a newline is typed and <br>
more lines are required to complete the command. If not set
in the environment, it is initialized by prompt=(&rsquo;%
&rsquo; &rsquo; &rsquo;). <br>
$status Set to the wait message of the last-executed
program. (unless started with &amp;). ! and ~ also change
$status. Its value is used to control execution in
&amp;&amp;, ||, if and <br>
while commands. When rc exits at end-of-file of its input or
on executing an exit command with no argument, $status is
its exit status.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Invocation <br>
If rc is started with no arguments it reads commands from
standard input. Otherwise its first non-flag argument is the
name of a file from which to read commands (but see -c <br>
below). Subsequent arguments become the initial value of $*.
Rc accepts the following command-line flags. <br>
-c string Commands are read from string. <br>
-s Print out exit status after any command where the status
is non-null. <br>
-e Exit if $status is non-null after executing a simple
command. <br>
-i If -i is present, or rc is given no arguments and its
standard input is a terminal, it runs interactively.
Commands are prompted for using $prompt. <br>
-I Makes sure rc is not run interactively. <br>
-l If -l is given or the first character of argument zero is
-, rc reads commands from $home/lib/profile, if it exists,
before reading its normal input. <br>
-p A no-op. <br>
-d A no-op. <br>
-v Echo input on file descriptor 2 as it is read. <br>
-x Print each simple command before executing it. <br>
-r Print debugging information (internal form of commands as
they are executed).</p>
