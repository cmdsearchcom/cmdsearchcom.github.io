<p>UUDECODE(1POSIX) POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s Manual
UUDECODE(1POSIX)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROLOG <br>
This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s
Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of <br>
Linux behavior), or the interface may not be implemented on
Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
uudecode &acirc; decode a binary file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
uudecode [&acirc;o outfile] [file]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The uudecode utility shall read a file, or standard input if
no file is specified, that includes data created by the
uuencode utility. The uudecode utility shall scan the input
<br>
file, searching for data compatible with one of the formats
specified in uuencode, and attempt to create or overwrite
the file described by the data (or overridden by the
&acirc;o <br>
option). The pathname shall be contained in the data or
specified by the &acirc;o option. The file access permission
bits and contents for the file to be produced shall be
contained in <br>
that data. The mode bits of the created file (other than
standard output) shall be set from the file access
permission bits contained in the data; that is, other
attributes of <br>
the mode, including the file mode creation mask (see umask),
shall not affect the file being produced. If either of the
op characters &rsquo;+&rsquo; and &rsquo;&acirc;&rsquo; (see
chmod) are specified in <br>
symbolic mode, the initial mode on which those operations
are based is unspecified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the pathname of the file to
be produced exists, and the user does not have write
permission on that file, uudecode shall terminate with an
error. If the pathname of the file <br>
to be produced exists, and the user has write permission on
that file, the existing file shall be overwritten.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the input data was produced
by uuencode on a system with a different number of bits per
byte than on the target system, the results of uudecode are
unspecified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The uudecode utility shall conform to the Base Definitions
volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax
Guidelines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following option shall be
supported by the implementation:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;o outfile <br>
A pathname of a file that shall be used instead of any
pathname contained in the input data. Specifying an outfile
option-argument of /dev/stdout shall indicate stan&acirc;
<br>
dard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERANDS <br>
The following operand shall be supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file The pathname of a file
containing the output of uuencode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDIN <br>
See the INPUT FILES section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUT FILES <br>
The input files shall be files containing the output of
uuencode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
The following environment variables shall affect the
execution of uudecode:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LANG Provide a default value for
the internationalization variables that are unset or null.
(See the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008,
Section 8.2, Internationaliza&acirc; <br>
tion Variables for the precedence of internationalization
variables used to determine the values of locale
categories.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_ALL If set to a non-empty
string value, override the values of all the other
internationalization variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_CTYPE Determine the locale
for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text data as
characters (for example, single-byte as opposed to
multi-byte characters in arguments <br>
and input files).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_MESSAGES <br>
Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
standard error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NLSPATH Determine the location
of message catalogs for the processing of LC_MESSAGES.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDOUT <br>
If the file data header encoded by uuencode is &acirc; or
/dev/stdout, or the &acirc;o /dev/stdout option overrides
the file data, the standard output shall be in the same
format as the file <br>
originally encoded by uuencode. Otherwise, the standard
output shall not be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDERR <br>
The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT FILES <br>
The output file shall be in the same format as the file
originally encoded by uuencode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTENDED DESCRIPTION <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The following exit values shall be returned:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 Successful completion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following sections are
informative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">APPLICATION USAGE <br>
The user who is invoking uudecode must have write permission
on any file being created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The output of uuencode is
essentially an encoded bit stream that is not cognizant of
byte boundaries. It is possible that a 9-bit byte target
machine can process input from an <br>
8-bit source, if it is aware of the requirement, but the
reverse is unlikely to be satisfying. Of course, the only
data that is meaningful for such a transfer between
architec&acirc; <br>
tures is generally character data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RATIONALE <br>
Input files are not necessarily text files, as stated by an
early proposal. Although the uuencode output is a text file,
that output could have been wrapped within another file <br>
or mail message that is not a text file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &acirc;o option is not
historical practice, but was added at the request of WG15 so
that the user could override the target pathname without
having to edit the input data itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In early drafts, the [&acirc;o
outfile] option-argument allowed the use of &acirc; to mean
standard output. The symbol &acirc; has only been used
previously in POSIX.1&acirc;2008 as a standard input <br>
indicator. The standard developers did not wish to overload
the meaning of &acirc; in this manner. The /dev/stdout
concept exists on most modern systems. The /dev/stdout
syntax does <br>
not refer to a new special file. It is just a magic cookie
to specify standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FUTURE DIRECTIONS <br>
None.</p>
