<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
checkrestart - check which processes need to be restarted
after an upgrade</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
checkrestart [ -hvpan ] [ -b blacklist_file ] [ -i
package_name ] [ -e pid ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The checkrestart program tries to determine if there are
processes in the system that need to be restarted after a
system upgrade. This is necessary since an upgrade will
usually <br>
bring new system libraries and running processes will be
still using the old versions of the libraries. In stable
Debian GNU/Linux systems this is typically needed to
eliminate a <br>
system exposure to a vulnerability which might have been
fixed by upgrading a library which that process makes use
of.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Consequently, checkrestart is
sometimes used as an audit tool to find outdated versions of
libraries in use, particularly after security upgrades.
Administrators should not, how&acirc; <br>
ever, rely on its output completely (see BUGS below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This script needs to run as root
in order to obtain the information it needs for
analysis.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-h, --help <br>
Show the program help and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
Generate detailed output. This output includes the list of
all processes found using deleted files or descriptors as
well as the deleted files and descriptors found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, --package <br>
Only process deleted files that belong to a package,
ignoring deleted files which do not have an associated
package in the package system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a, --all <br>
Process all deleted files regardless of location. This makes
the program analyse deleted files even if they would be
discarded because they are located in locations, such <br>
as /tmp , which are known to produce false positives. It
will take preceded if used simultaneously with the -p
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b file, --blacklist=file <br>
Read a blacklist of regular expressions from file. Any files
matching the patterns will be ignored. More than one pattern
can be provided by using this option more than <br>
once.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i name, --ignore=name <br>
Ignore services that are associated to the package name
provided in name. More than one package can be provided by
using this option more than once.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e pid, --excludepid=pid <br>
Exclude processes running with pid when looking for open
files. This can speed up checkrestart on systems with a
large number of open files. Note: this option only works
<br>
if lsof(8) is not used. More than one process identifier can
be provided by using this option more than once.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --nolsof <br>
Do not use lsof(8) even if available. In some systems where
there are large number of files the use of lsof might be
inefficient. Use this option to disable lsof. Notice <br>
also that if lsof is not installed an alternative mechanism
to extract deleted files will be used instead. Consequently,
there is no need to set this option in systems <br>
that do not have lsof(8) installed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The program will exit with error (1) if a non-root user
tries to run it. Otherwise, it will always exit with error
status 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLE <br>
Start it as user root without parameters:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># checkrestart <br>
Found 20 processes using old versions of upgraded files <br>
(15 distinct programs) <br>
(14 distinct packages)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Of these, 12 seem to contain
init scripts which can be used to restart them: <br>
The following packages seem to have init scripts that could
be used to restart them: <br>
gpm: <br>
3044 /usr/sbin/gpm <br>
rpcbind: <br>
2208 /sbin/rpcbind <br>
bind9: <br>
8463 /usr/sbin/named <br>
openssh-server: <br>
22124 /usr/sbin/sshd <br>
ntp: <br>
4078 /usr/sbin/ntpd <br>
tftpd-hpa: <br>
3417 /usr/sbin/in.tftpd <br>
uptimed: <br>
2704 /usr/sbin/uptimed <br>
cron: <br>
3019 /usr/sbin/cron <br>
postfix: <br>
22145 /usr/lib/postfix/qmgr <br>
8892 /usr/lib/postfix/master <br>
hddtemp: <br>
3174 /usr/sbin/hddtemp <br>
autofs: <br>
2792 /usr/sbin/automount <br>
openbsd-inetd: <br>
3254 /usr/sbin/inetd</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These are the init scripts: <br>
service gpm restart <br>
service rpcbind restart <br>
service bind9 restart <br>
service ssh restart <br>
service ntp restart <br>
service tftpd-hpa restart <br>
service uptimed restart <br>
service cron restart <br>
service postfix restart <br>
service hddtemp restart <br>
service autofs restart <br>
service openbsd-inetd restart</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These processes do not seem to
have an associated init script to restart them: <br>
isc-dhcp-client: <br>
3775 /sbin/dhclient</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
This program might fail if the output of the lsof(8) utility
changes since it depends on it to detect which deleted files
are used by processes. It might also output some false <br>
positives depending on the processes&rsquo; behaviour since
it does not check yet if the (deleted) files in use are
really libraries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you find a false positive in
checkrestart please provide the following information when
submitting a bug report:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc; The output of
checkrestart using the -v (verbose) option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc; The output of running
the following command as root:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lsof | egrep
&rsquo;delete|DEL|path inode&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">checkrestart is also sensitive
to the kernel version in use. And might fail to work with
newer (or older) versions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
lsof(8), needrestart(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please note that the needrestart
program uses a different logic to determine which services
should be restarted based on deleted files. Results might
not be exactly the same as <br>
those provided by checkrestart</p>
