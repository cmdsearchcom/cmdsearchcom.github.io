<p>PERL5220DELTA(1) Perl Programmers Reference Guide
PERL5220DELTA(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
perl5220delta - what is new for perl v5.22.0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This document describes differences between the 5.20.0
release and the 5.22.0 release.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are upgrading from an
earlier release such as 5.18.0, first read perl5200delta,
which describes differences between 5.18.0 and 5.20.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Core Enhancements <br>
New bitwise operators <br>
A new experimental facility has been added that makes the
four standard bitwise operators (&quot;&amp; | ^ ~&quot;)
treat their operands consistently as numbers, and introduces
four new dotted <br>
operators (&quot;&amp;. |. ^. ~.&quot;) that treat their
operands consistently as strings. The same applies to the
assignment variants (&quot;&amp;= |= ^= &amp;.= |.=
^.=&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To use this, enable the
&quot;bitwise&quot; feature and disable the
&quot;experimental::bitwise&quot; warnings category. See
&quot;Bitwise String Operators&quot; in perlop for details.
[perl #123466] <br>

&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123466&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">New double-diamond operator <br>
&quot;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&quot; is like &quot;&lt;&gt;&quot;
but uses three-argument &quot;open&quot; to open each file
in @ARGV. This means that each element of @ARGV will be
treated as an actual file name, and &quot;|foo&quot;
won&rsquo;t be <br>
treated as a pipe open. b o u n d a r i e s i n r e g</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">New &quot;u l a r e x p r e s s
i o n s g c b <br>
&quot;qr/} / &quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;gcb&quot; stands for
Grapheme Cluster Boundary. It is a Unicode property that
finds the boundary between sequences of characters that look
like a single character to a native <br>
speaker of a language. Perl has long had the ability to deal
with these through the &quot;} <br>
&quot;, w b</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;qr/} / &quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;wb&quot; stands for Word
Boundary. It is a Unicode property that finds the boundary
between words. This is similar to the ( w i t h o u t b r a
c e s ) b u plain &quot;t i s m o r e s u i t a b l e f o r
<br>
natural language processing. It knows, for example, that}
apostrophes can occur in the middle of words. See &quot;,s
b</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;qr/} / &quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;sb&quot; stands for
Sentence Boundary. It is a Unicode} property to aid in
parsing natural language sentences. See &quot;,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Non-Capturing Regular Expression
Flag <br>
Regular expressions now support a &quot;/n&quot; flag that
disables capturing and filling in $1, $2, etc inside of
groups:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;hello&quot; =~
/(hi|hello)/n; # $1 is not set</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is equivalent to putting
&quot;?:&quot; at the beginning of every capturing
group.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See &quot;n&quot; in perlre for
more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;use re
&rsquo;strict&rsquo;&quot; <br>
This applies stricter syntax rules to regular expression
patterns compiled within its scope. This will hopefully
alert you to typos and other unintentional behavior that
<br>
backwards-compatibility issues prevent us from reporting in
normal regular expression compilations. Because the behavior
of this is subject to change in future Perl releases as <br>
we gain experience, using this pragma will raise a warning
of category &quot;experimental::re_strict&quot;. See
&rsquo;strict&rsquo; in re.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unicode 7.0 (with correction) is
now supported <br>
For details on what is in this release, see
&lt;http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode7.0.0/&gt;. The
version of Unicode 7.0 that comes with Perl includes a
correction dealing with <br>
glyph shaping in Arabic (see
&lt;http://www.unicode.org/errata/#current_errata&gt;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;use locale&quot; can
restrict which locale categories are affected <br>
It is now possible to pass a parameter to &quot;use
locale&quot; to specify a subset of locale categories to be
locale-aware, with the remaining ones unaffected. See
&quot;The &quot;use locale&quot; <br>
pragma&quot; in perllocale for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl now supports POSIX 2008
locale currency additions <br>
On platforms that are able to handle POSIX.1-2008, the hash
returned by &quot;POSIX::localeconv()&quot; includes the
international currency fields added by that version of the
POSIX <br>
standard. These are &quot;int_n_cs_precedes&quot;,
&quot;int_n_sep_by_space&quot;, &quot;int_n_sign_posn&quot;,
&quot;int_p_cs_precedes&quot;,
&quot;int_p_sep_by_space&quot;, and
&quot;int_p_sign_posn&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Better heuristics on older
platforms for determining locale UTF-8ness <br>
On platforms that implement neither the C99 standard nor the
POSIX 2001 standard, determining if the current locale is
UTF-8 or not depends on heuristics. These are improved in
<br>
this release.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Aliasing via reference <br>
Variables and subroutines can now be aliased by assigning to
a reference:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">= ; <br>
x = y;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Aliasing can also be
accomplished by using a backslash before a
&quot;foreach&quot; iterator variable; this is perhaps the
most useful idiom this feature provides:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">foreach hash
(@array_of_hash_refs) { ... }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This feature is experimental and
must be enabled via &quot;use feature
&rsquo;refaliasing&rsquo;&quot;. It will warn unless the
&quot;experimental::refaliasing&quot; warnings category is
disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See &quot;Assigning to
References&quot; in perlref</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;prototype&quot; with no
arguments <br>
&quot;prototype()&quot; with no arguments now infers $_.
[perl #123514]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123514&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">New &quot;:const&quot;
subroutine attribute <br>
The &quot;const&quot; attribute can be applied to an
anonymous subroutine. It causes the new sub to be executed
immediately whenever one is created (i.e. when the
&quot;sub&quot; expression is <br>
evaluated). Its value is captured and used to create a new
constant subroutine that is returned. This feature is
experimental. See &quot;Constant Functions&quot; in
perlsub.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;fileno&quot; now works on
directory handles <br>
When the relevant support is available in the operating
system, the &quot;fileno&quot; builtin now works on
directory handles, yielding the underlying file descriptor
in the same way as <br>
for filehandles. On operating systems without such support,
&quot;fileno&quot; on a directory handle continues to return
the undefined value, as before, but also sets $! to indicate
that <br>
the operation is not supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Currently, this uses either a
&quot;dd_fd&quot; member in the OS &quot;DIR&quot;
structure, or a dirfd(3) function as specified by
POSIX.1-2008.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">List form of pipe open
implemented for Win32 <br>
The list form of pipe:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">open my $fh, &quot;-|&quot;,
&quot;program&quot;, @arguments;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">is now implemented on Win32. It
has the same limitations as &quot;system LIST&quot; on
Win32, since the Win32 API doesn&rsquo;t accept program
arguments as a list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Assignment to list repetition
<br>
&quot;(...) x ...&quot; can now be used within a list that
is assigned to, as long as the left-hand side is a valid
lvalue. This allows &quot;(undef,undef,$foo) =
that_function()&quot; to be <br>
written as &quot;((undef)x2, $foo) =
that_function()&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Infinity and NaN (not-a-number)
handling improved <br>
Floating point values are able to hold the special values
infinity, negative infinity, and NaN (not-a-number). Now we
more robustly recognize and propagate the value in <br>
computations, and on output normalize them to the strings
&quot;Inf&quot;, &quot;-Inf&quot;, and &quot;NaN&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See also the POSIX
enhancements.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Floating point parsing has been
improved <br>
Parsing and printing of floating point values has been
improved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As a completely new feature,
hexadecimal floating point literals (like
&quot;0x1.23p-4&quot;) are now supported, and they can be
output with &quot;printf &quot;%a&quot;&quot;. See
&quot;Scalar value constructors&quot; <br>
in perldata for more details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Packing infinity or not-a-number
into a character is now fatal <br>
Before, when trying to pack infinity or not-a-number into a
(signed) character, Perl would warn, and assumed you tried
to pack 0xFF; if you gave it as an argument to
&quot;chr&quot;, <br>
&quot;U+FFFD&quot; was returned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">But now, all such actions
(&quot;pack&quot;, &quot;chr&quot;, and &quot;print
&rsquo;%c&rsquo;&quot;) result in a fatal error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Experimental C Backtrace API
<br>
Perl now supports (via a C level API) retrieving the C level
backtrace (similar to what symbolic debuggers like gdb
do).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The backtrace returns the stack
trace of the C call frames, with the symbol names (function
names), the object names (like &quot;perl&quot;), and if it
can, also the source code locations <br>
(file:line).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The supported platforms are
Linux and OS X (some *BSD might work at least partly, but
they have not yet been tested).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The feature needs to be enabled
with &quot;Configure -Dusecbacktrace&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See &quot;C backtrace&quot; in
perlhacktips for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Security <br>
Perl is now compiled with
&quot;-fstack-protector-strong&quot; if available <br>
Perl has been compiled with the anti-stack-smashing option
&quot;-fstack-protector&quot; since 5.10.1. Now Perl uses
the newer variant called
&quot;-fstack-protector-strong&quot;, if available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Safe module could allow
outside packages to be replaced <br>
Critical bugfix: outside packages could be replaced. Safe
has been patched to 2.38 to address this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl is now always compiled with
&quot;-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2&quot; if available <br>
The &rsquo;code hardening&rsquo; option called
&quot;_FORTIFY_SOURCE&quot;, available in gcc 4.*, is now
always used for compiling Perl, if available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that this isn&rsquo;t
necessarily a huge step since in many platforms the step had
already been taken several years ago: many Linux
distributions (like Fedora) have been using <br>
this option for Perl, and OS X has enforced the same for
many years.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Incompatible Changes <br>
Subroutine signatures moved before attributes <br>
The experimental sub signatures feature, as introduced in
5.20, parsed signatures after attributes. In this release,
following feedback from users of the experimental feature,
<br>
the positioning has been moved such that signatures occur
after the subroutine name (if any) and before the attribute
list (if any).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;&amp;&quot; and
&quot;&quot; prototypes accepts only subs <br>
The &quot;&amp;&quot; prototype character now accepts only
anonymous subs (&quot;sub {...}&quot;), things beginning
with &quot;&quot;, or an explicit &quot;undef&quot;.
Formerly it erroneously also allowed references to <br>
arrays, hashes, and lists. [perl #4539]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=4539&gt;.
[perl #123062]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123062&gt;.
[perl #123062] <br>

&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123475&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition, the &quot;&quot;
prototype was allowing subroutine calls, whereas now it only
allows subroutines: &amp;foo is still permitted as an
argument, while &quot;&amp;foo()&quot; and &quot;foo()&quot;
no <br>
longer are. [perl #77860]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=77860&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;use encoding&quot; is now
lexical <br>
The encoding pragma&rsquo;s effect is now limited to lexical
scope. This pragma is deprecated, but in the meantime, it
could adversely affect unrelated modules that are included
in <br>
the same program; this change fixes that.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">List slices returning empty
lists <br>
List slices now return an empty list only if the original
list was empty (or if there are no indices). Formerly, a
list slice would return an empty list if all indices fell
<br>
outside the original list; now it returns a list of
&quot;undef&quot; values in that case. [perl #114498]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=114498&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;&quot; with a sequence of
multiple spaces is now a fatal error <br>
E.g. &quot;OO MANY SPACES}&quot; or &quot;RAILING SPACE
}&quot;. This has been deprecated since v5.18.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;use UNIVERSAL
&rsquo;...&rsquo;&quot; is now a fatal error <br>
Importing functions from &quot;UNIVERSAL&quot; has been
deprecated since v5.12, and is now a fatal error. &quot;use
UNIVERSAL&quot; without any arguments is still allowed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In double-quotish &quot; In
prior releases, failure to do this raised a deprecation
warning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Splitting the tokens
&quot;(?&quot; and &quot;(*&quot; in regular expressions is
now a fatal compilation error. <br>
These had been deprecated since v5.18.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;qr/foo/x&quot; now ignores
all Unicode pattern white space <br>
The &quot;/x&quot; regular expression modifier allows the
pattern to contain white space and comments (both of which
are ignored) for improved readability. Until now, not all
the white <br>
space characters that Unicode designates for this purpose
were handled. The additional ones now recognized are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">U+0085 NEXT LINE <br>
U+200E LEFT-TO-RIGHT MARK <br>
U+200F RIGHT-TO-LEFT MARK <br>
U+2028 LINE SEPARATOR <br>
U+2029 PARAGRAPH SEPARATOR</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The use of these characters with
&quot;/x&quot; outside bracketed character classes and when
not preceded by a backslash has raised a deprecation warning
since v5.18. Now they will be <br>
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Comment lines within &quot;(?[
])&quot; are now ended only by a &quot;0 <br>
&quot;(?[ ])&quot; is an experimental feature, introduced in
v5.18. It operates as if &quot;/x&quot; is always enabled.
But there was a difference: comment lines (following a
&quot;#&quot; character) were <br>
terminated by anything matching &quot;ncludes all vertical
whitespace, such as form feeds. For consistency, this is now
changed to match what terminates comment lines <br>
outside &quot;(?[ ])&quot;, namely a &quot;0 (even if
escaped), which is the same as what terminates a heredoc
string and formats.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;(?[...])&quot; operators
now follow standard Perl precedence <br>
This experimental feature allows set operations in regular
expression patterns. Prior to this, the intersection
operator had the same precedence as the other binary
operators. <br>
Now it has higher precedence. This could lead to different
outcomes than existing code expects (though the
documentation has always noted that this change might
happen, <br>
recommending fully parenthesizing the expressions). See
&quot;Extended Bracketed Character Classes&quot; in
perlrecharclass.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Omitting &quot;%&quot; and
&quot;@&quot; on hash and array names is no longer permitted
<br>
Really old Perl let you omit the &quot;@&quot; on array
names and the &quot;%&quot; on hash names in some spots.
This has issued a deprecation warning since Perl 5.000, and
is no longer permitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;$!&quot; text is now in
English outside the scope of &quot;use locale&quot; <br>
Previously, the text, unlike almost everything else, always
came out based on the current underlying locale of the
program. (Also affected on some systems is &quot;$^E&quot;.)
For <br>
programs that are unprepared to handle locale differences,
this can cause garbage text to be displayed. It&rsquo;s
better to display text that is translatable via some tool
than <br>
garbage text which is much harder to figure out.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;$!&quot; text will be
returned in UTF-8 when appropriate <br>
The stringification of $! and $^E will have the UTF-8 flag
set when the text is actually non-ASCII UTF-8. This will
enable programs that are set up to be locale-aware to <br>
properly output messages in the user&rsquo;s native
language. Code that needs to continue the 5.20 and earlier
behavior can do the stringification within the scopes of
both <br>
&quot;use bytes&quot; and &quot;use locale
&quot;:messages&quot;&quot;. Within these two scopes, no
other Perl operations will be affected by locale; only $!
and $^E stringification. The &quot;bytes&quot; pragma <br>
causes the UTF-8 flag to not be set, just as in previous
Perl releases. This resolves [perl #112208]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=112208&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Support for
&quot;?PATTERN?&quot; without explicit operator has been
removed <br>
The &quot;m?PATTERN?&quot; construct, which allows matching
a regex only once, previously had an alternative form that
was written directly with a question mark delimiter,
omitting the <br>
explicit &quot;m&quot; operator. This usage has produced a
deprecation warning since 5.14.0. It is now a syntax error,
so that the question mark can be available for use in new
<br>
operators.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;defined(@array)&quot; and
&quot;defined(%hash)&quot; are now fatal errors <br>
These have been deprecated since v5.6.1 and have raised
deprecation warnings since v5.16.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using a hash or an array as a
reference are now fatal errors <br>
For example, &quot;%foo-&gt;{&quot;bar&quot;}&quot; now
causes a fatal compilation error. These have been deprecated
since before v5.8, and have raised deprecation warnings
since then.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Changes to the &quot;*&quot;
prototype <br>
The &quot;*&quot; character in a subroutine&rsquo;s
prototype used to allow barewords to take precedence over
most, but not all, subroutine names. It was never consistent
and exhibited buggy <br>
behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Now it has been changed, so
subroutines always take precedence over barewords, which
brings it into conformity with similarly prototyped built-in
functions:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sub splat(*) { ... } <br>
sub foo { ... } <br>
splat(foo); # now always splat(foo()) <br>
splat(bar); # still splat(&rsquo;bar&rsquo;) as before <br>
close(foo); # close(foo()) <br>
close(bar); # close(&rsquo;bar&rsquo;)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Deprecations <br>
Setting &quot;${^ENCODING}&quot; to anything but
&quot;undef&quot; <br>
This variable allows Perl scripts to be written in an
encoding other than ASCII or UTF-8. However, it affects all
modules globally, leading to wrong answers and segmentation
<br>
faults. New scripts should be written in UTF-8; old scripts
should be converted to UTF-8, which is easily done with the
piconv utility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use of non-graphic characters in
single-character variable names <br>
The syntax for single-character variable names is more
lenient than for longer variable names, allowing the
one-character name to be a punctuation character or even
invisible (a <br>
non-graphic). Perl v5.20 deprecated the ASCII-range controls
as such a name. Now, all non-graphic characters that
formerly were allowed are deprecated. The practical effect
of <br>
this occurs only when not under &quot;use utf8&quot;, and
affects just the C1 controls (code points 0x80 through
0xFF), NO-BREAK SPACE, and SOFT HYPHEN.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Inlining of &quot;sub () { $var
}&quot; with observable side-effects <br>
In many cases Perl makes &quot;sub () { $var }&quot; into an
inlinable constant subroutine, capturing the value of $var
at the time the &quot;sub&quot; expression is evaluated.
This can break the <br>
closure behavior in those cases where $var is subsequently
modified, since the subroutine won&rsquo;t return the
changed value. (Note that this all only applies to anonymous
<br>
subroutines with an empty prototype (&quot;sub
()&quot;).)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This usage is now deprecated in
those cases where the variable could be modified elsewhere.
Perl detects those cases and emits a deprecation warning.
Such code will likely <br>
change in the future and stop producing a constant.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If your variable is only
modified in the place where it is declared, then Perl will
continue to make the sub inlinable with no warnings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sub make_constant { <br>
my $var = shift; <br>
return sub () { $var }; # fine <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sub make_constant_deprecated {
<br>
my $var; <br>
$var = shift; <br>
return sub () { $var }; # deprecated <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sub make_constant_deprecated2 {
<br>
my $var = shift; <br>
log_that_value($var); # could modify $var <br>
return sub () { $var }; # deprecated <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the second example above,
detecting that $var is assigned to only once is too hard to
detect. That it happens in a spot other than the
&quot;my&quot; declaration is enough for Perl to <br>
find it suspicious.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This deprecation warning happens
only for a simple variable for the body of the sub. (A
&quot;BEGIN&quot; block or &quot;use&quot; statement inside
the sub is ignored, because it does not become <br>
part of the sub&rsquo;s body.) For more complex cases, such
as &quot;sub () { do_something() if 0; $var }&quot; the
behavior has changed such that inlining does not happen if
the variable is <br>
modifiable elsewhere. Such cases should be rare.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use of multiple &quot;/x&quot;
regexp modifiers <br>
It is now deprecated to say something like any of the
following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">qr/foo/xx; <br>
/(?xax:foo)/; <br>
use re qw(/amxx);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">That is, now &quot;x&quot;
should only occur once in any string of contiguous regular
expression pattern modifiers. We do not believe there are
any occurrences of this in all of CPAN. <br>
This is in preparation for a future Perl release having
&quot;/xx&quot; permit white-space for readability in
bracketed character classes (those enclosed in square
brackets: &quot;[...]&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using a NO-BREAK space in a
character alias for &quot; is now deprecated <br>
This non-graphic character is essentially indistinguishable
from a regular space, and so should not be allowed. See
&quot;CUSTOM ALIASES&quot; in charnames.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A literal &quot;{&quot; should
now be escaped in a pattern <br>
If you want a literal left curly bracket (also called a left
brace) in a regular expression pattern, you should now
escape it by either preceding it with a backslash
(&quot;&quot;) or <br>
enclosing it within square brackets &quot;[{]&quot;, or by
using &quot;Q&quot;; otherwise a deprecation warning will be
raised. This was first announced as forthcoming in the v5.16
release; it <br>
will allow future extensions to the language to happen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Making all warnings fatal is
discouraged <br>
The documentation for fatal warnings notes that &quot;use
warnings FATAL =&gt; &rsquo;all&rsquo;&quot; is discouraged,
and provides stronger language about the risks of fatal
warnings in general.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Performance Enhancements <br>
&Acirc;&middot; If a method or class name is known at
compile time, a hash is precomputed to speed up run-time
method lookup. Also, compound method names like
&quot;SUPER::new&quot; are parsed at <br>
compile time, to save having to parse them at run time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Array and hash
lookups (especially nested ones) that use only constants or
simple variables as keys, are now considerably faster. See
&quot;Internal Changes&quot; for more details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;(...)x1&quot;, &quot;(&quot;constant&quot;)x0&quot;
and &quot;($scalar)x0&quot; are now optimised in list
context. If the right-hand argument is a constant 1, the
repetition operator disappears. If the <br>
right-hand argument is a constant 0, the whole expression is
optimised to the empty list, so long as the left-hand
argument is a simple scalar or constant. (That is, <br>
&quot;(foo())x0&quot; is not subject to this
optimisation.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;substr&quot; assignment is now optimised into
4-argument &quot;substr&quot; at the end of a subroutine (or
as the argument to &quot;return&quot;). Previously, this
optimisation only happened in <br>
void context.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; In
&quot;..&quot;, &quot;Q...&quot;, etc., the extra
&quot;stringify&quot; op is now optimised away, making these
just as fast as &quot;lcfirst&quot;, &quot;quotemeta&quot;,
etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Assignment to an
empty list is now sometimes faster. In particular, it never
calls &quot;FETCH&quot; on tied arguments on the right-hand
side, whereas it used to sometimes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; There is a
performance improvement of up to 20% when &quot;length&quot;
is applied to a non-magical, non-tied string, and either
&quot;use bytes&quot; is in scope or the string
doesn&rsquo;t use UTF-8 <br>
internally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; On most perl
builds with 64-bit integers, memory usage for non-magical,
non-tied scalars containing only a floating point value has
been reduced by between 8 and 32 bytes, <br>
depending on OS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; In &quot;@array
= split&quot;, the assignment can be optimized away, so that
&quot;split&quot; writes directly to the array. This
optimisation was happening only for package arrays other
than <br>
@_, and only sometimes. Now this optimisation happens almost
all the time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &quot;join&quot;
is now subject to constant folding. So for example
&quot;join &quot;-&quot;, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;&quot;
is converted at compile-time to &quot;a-b&quot;. Moreover,
&quot;join&quot; with a scalar or constant for the <br>
separator and a single-item list to join is simplified to a
stringification, and the separator doesn&rsquo;t even get
evaluated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;qq(@array)&quot; is implemented using two ops: a
stringify op and a join op. If the &quot;qq&quot; contains
nothing but a single array, the stringification is optimized
away.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &quot;our
$var&quot; and &quot;our($s,@a,%h)&quot; in void context are
no longer evaluated at run time. Even a whole sequence of
&quot;our $foo;&quot; statements will simply be skipped
over. The same <br>
applies to &quot;state&quot; variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Many internal
functions have been refactored to improve performance and
reduce their memory footprints. [perl #121436]

empty file is detected. [perl #121489]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=121489&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Hash lookups
where the key is a constant are faster.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Subroutines with
an empty prototype and a body containing just
&quot;undef&quot; are now eligible for inlining. [perl
#122728]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=122728&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Subroutines in
packages no longer need to be stored in typeglobs: declaring
a subroutine will now put a simple sub reference directly in
the stash if possible, saving memory. <br>
The typeglob still notionally exists, so accessing it will
cause the stash entry to be upgraded to a typeglob (i.e.
this is just an internal implementation detail). This <br>
optimization does not currently apply to XSUBs or exported
subroutines, and method calls will undo it, since they cache
things in typeglobs. [perl #120441] <br>

&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=120441&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The functions
&quot;utf8::native_to_unicode()&quot; and
&quot;utf8::unicode_to_native()&quot; (see utf8) are now
optimized out on ASCII platforms. There is now not even a
minimal performance <br>
hit in writing code portable between ASCII and EBCDIC
platforms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Win32 Perl uses
8 KB less of per-process memory than before for every perl
process, because some data is now memory mapped from disk
and shared between processes from the <br>
same perl binary.</p>

New Errors</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Bad symbol for
scalar</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(P) An internal request asked to
add a scalar entry to something that wasn&rsquo;t a symbol
table entry.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Can&rsquo;t use
a hash as a reference</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(F) You tried to use a hash as a
reference, as in &quot;%foo-&gt;{&quot;bar&quot;}&quot; or
&quot;%$ref-&gt;{&quot;hello&quot;}&quot;. Versions of perl
&lt;= 5.6.1 used to allow this syntax, but shouldn&rsquo;t
have.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Can&rsquo;t use
an array as a reference</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(F) You tried to use an array as
a reference, as in &quot;@foo-&gt;[23]&quot; or
&quot;@$ref-&gt;[99]&quot;. Versions of perl &lt;= 5.6.1
used to allow this syntax, but shouldn&rsquo;t have.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Can&rsquo;t use
&rsquo;defined(@array)&rsquo; (Maybe you should just omit
the defined()?)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(F) &quot;defined()&quot; is not
useful on arrays because it checks for an undefined scalar
value. If you want to see if the array is empty, just use
&quot;if (@array) { # not empty }&quot; for <br>
example.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Can&rsquo;t use
&rsquo;defined(%hash)&rsquo; (Maybe you should just omit the
defined()?)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(F) &quot;defined()&quot; is not
usually right on hashes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Although &quot;defined
%hash&quot; is false on a plain not-yet-used hash, it
becomes true in several non-obvious circumstances, including
iterators, weak references, stash names, even <br>
remaining true after &quot;undef %hash&quot;. These things
make &quot;defined %hash&quot; fairly useless in practice,
so it now generates a fatal error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a check for non-empty is what
you wanted then just put it in boolean context (see
&quot;Scalar values&quot; in perldata):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if (%hash) { <br>
# not empty <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you had &quot;defined
%Foo::Bar::QUUX&quot; to check whether such a package
variable exists then that&rsquo;s never really been
reliable, and isn&rsquo;t a good way to enquire about the
<br>
features of a package, or whether it&rsquo;s loaded,
etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Cannot chr
%f</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(F) You passed an invalid number
(like an infinity or not-a-number) to &quot;chr&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Cannot compress
%f in pack</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(F) You tried converting an
infinity or not-a-number to an unsigned character, which
makes no sense.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Cannot pack %f
with &rsquo;%c&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(F) You tried converting an
infinity or not-a-number to a character, which makes no
sense.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Cannot print %f
with &rsquo;%c&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(F) You tried printing an
infinity or not-a-number as a character (%c), which makes no
sense. Maybe you meant &rsquo;%s&rsquo;, or just
stringifying it?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; charnames alias
definitions may not contain a sequence of multiple
spaces</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(F) You defined a character name
which had multiple space characters in a row. Change them to
single spaces. Usually these names are defined in the
&quot;:alias&quot; import argument <br>
to &quot;use charnames&quot;, but they could be defined by a
translator installed into $^H{charnames}. See &quot;CUSTOM
ALIASES&quot; in charnames.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; charnames alias
definitions may not contain trailing white-space</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(F) You defined a character name
which ended in a space character. Remove the trailing
space(s). Usually these names are defined in the
&quot;:alias&quot; import argument to &quot;use <br>
charnames&quot;, but they could be defined by a translator
installed into $^H{charnames}. See &quot;CUSTOM
ALIASES&quot; in charnames.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; :const is not
permitted on named subroutines</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(F) The &quot;const&quot;
attribute causes an anonymous subroutine to be run and its
value captured at the time that it is cloned. Named
subroutines are not cloned like this, so the <br>
attribute does not make sense on them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Hexadecimal
float: internal error</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(F) Something went horribly bad
in hexadecimal float handling.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Hexadecimal
float: unsupported long double format</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(F) You have configured Perl to
use long doubles but the internals of the long double format
are unknown, therefore the hexadecimal float output is
impossible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Illegal
suidscript</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(F) The script run under
suidperl was somehow illegal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; In
&rsquo;(?...)&rsquo;, the &rsquo;(&rsquo; and
&rsquo;?&rsquo; must be adjacent in regex; marked by &lt;--

&quot;(?&quot; in this context in a regular expression
pattern should be an indivisible token, with nothing
intervening between the &quot;(&quot; and the &quot;?&quot;,
but <br>
you separated them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning: unable to close

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(S io) Previously, perl silently
ignored any errors when doing an implicit close of a

reached zero and the user&rsquo;s <br>

(U+%X) in %s</p>

character was encountered. Perl considers this character to
be the specified Unicode code <br>
point. Combining non-UTF-8 locales and Unicode is dangerous.
Almost certainly some characters will have two different
representations. For example, in the ISO 8859-7 <br>
(Greek) locale, the code point 0xC3 represents a Capital
Gamma. But so also does 0x393. This will make string
comparisons unreliable.</p>

Core perl now works on this EBCDIC platform. Earlier perls
also worked, but, even though support wasn&rsquo;t
officially withdrawn, recent perls would not compile and run
well. <br>
Perl 5.20 would work, but had many bugs which have now been
fixed. Many CPAN modules that ship with Perl still fail
tests, including &quot;Pod::Simple&quot;. However the
version of <br>
&quot;Pod::Simple&quot; currently on CPAN should work; it
was fixed too late to include in Perl 5.22. Work is under
way to fix many of the still-broken CPAN modules, which
likely will <br>
be installed on CPAN when completed, so that you may not
have to wait until Perl 5.24 to get a working version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Discontinued Platforms <br>
NeXTSTEP/OPENSTEP <br>
NeXTSTEP was a proprietary operating system bundled with
NeXT&rsquo;s workstations in the early to mid 90s; OPENSTEP
was an API specification that provided a NeXTSTEP-like <br>
environment on a non-NeXTSTEP system. Both are now long
dead, so support for building Perl on them has been
removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Platform-Specific Notes <br>
EBCDIC <br>
Special handling is required of the perl interpreter on
EBCDIC platforms to get &quot;qr/[i-j]/&quot; to match only
&quot;i&quot; and &quot;j&quot;, since there are 7
characters between the code points <br>
for &quot;i&quot; and &quot;j&quot;. This special handling
had only been invoked when both ends of the range are
literals. Now it is also invoked if any of the
&quot; forms for specifying a <br>
character by name or Unicode code point is used instead of a
literal. See &quot;Character Ranges&quot; in
perlrecharclass.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Internal Changes <br>
&Acirc;&middot; Experimental support has been added to allow
ops in the optree to locate their parent, if any. This is
enabled by the non-default build option
&quot;-DPERL_OP_PARENT&quot;. It is <br>
envisaged that this will eventually become enabled by
default, so XS code which directly accesses the
&quot;op_sibling&quot; field of ops should be updated to be
future-proofed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On &quot;PERL_OP_PARENT&quot;
builds, the &quot;op_sibling&quot; field has been renamed
&quot;op_sibparent&quot; and a new flag,
&quot;op_moresib&quot;, added. On the last op in a sibling
chain, &quot;op_moresib&quot; is <br>
false and &quot;op_sibparent&quot; points to the parent (if
any) rather than being &quot;NULL&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To make existing code work
transparently whether using &quot;PERL_OP_PARENT&quot; or
not, a number of new macros and functions have been added
that should be used, rather than directly <br>
manipulating &quot;op_sibling&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For the case of just reading
&quot;op_sibling&quot; to determine the next sibling, two
new macros have been added. A simple scan through a sibling
chain like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">for (; kid-&gt;op_sibling; kid =
kid-&gt;op_sibling) { ... }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">should now be written as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">for (; OpHAS_SIBLING(kid); kid =
OpSIBLING(kid)) { ... }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For altering optrees, a
general-purpose function &quot;op_sibling_splice()&quot; has
been added, which allows for manipulation of a chain of
sibling ops. By analogy with the Perl <br>
function &quot;splice()&quot;, it allows you to cut out zero
or more ops from a sibling chain and replace them with zero
or more new ops. It transparently handles all the updating
of <br>
sibling, parent, op_last pointers etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you need to manipulate ops at
a lower level, then three new macros,
&quot;OpMORESIB_set&quot;, &quot;OpLASTSIB_set&quot; and
&quot;OpMAYBESIB_set&quot; are intended to be a low-level
portable way to <br>
set &quot;op_sibling&quot; / &quot;op_sibparent&quot; while
also updating &quot;op_moresib&quot;. The first sets the
sibling pointer to a new sibling, the second makes the op
the last sibling, and the <br>
third conditionally does the first or second action. Note
that unlike &quot;op_sibling_splice()&quot; these macros
won&rsquo;t maintain consistency in the parent at the same
time (e.g. by <br>
updating &quot;op_first&quot; and &quot;op_last&quot; where
appropriate).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A C-level
&quot;Perl_op_parent()&quot; function and a Perl-level
&quot;B::OP::parent()&quot; method have been added. The C
function only exists under &quot;PERL_OP_PARENT&quot; builds
(using it is build- <br>
time error on vanilla perls). &quot;B::OP::parent()&quot;
exists always, but on a vanilla build it always returns
&quot;NULL&quot;. Under &quot;PERL_OP_PARENT&quot;, they
return the parent of the current <br>
op, if any. The variable $B::OP::does_parent allows you to
determine whether &quot;B&quot; supports retrieving an
op&rsquo;s parent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;PERL_OP_PARENT&quot; was
introduced in 5.21.2, but the interface was changed
considerably in 5.21.11. If you updated your code before the
5.21.11 changes, it may require further <br>
revision. The main changes after 5.21.2 were:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The
&quot;OP_SIBLING&quot; and &quot;OP_HAS_SIBLING&quot; macros
have been renamed &quot;OpSIBLING&quot; and
&quot;OpHAS_SIBLING&quot; for consistency with other
op-manipulating macros.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The
&quot;op_lastsib&quot; field has been renamed
&quot;op_moresib&quot;, and its meaning inverted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The macro
&quot;OpSIBLING_set&quot; has been removed, and has been
superseded by &quot;OpMORESIB_set&quot; et al.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The
&quot;op_sibling_splice()&quot; function now accepts a null
&quot;parent&quot; argument where the splicing doesn&rsquo;t
affect the first or last ops in the sibling chain</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Macros have been
created to allow XS code to better manipulate the POSIX
locale category &quot;LC_NUMERIC&quot;. See
&quot;Locale-related functions and macros&quot; in
perlapi.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The previous
&quot;atoi&quot; et al replacement function,
&quot;grok_atou&quot;, has now been superseded by
&quot;grok_atoUV&quot;. See perlclib for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A new function,
&quot;Perl_sv_get_backrefs()&quot;, has been added which
allows you retrieve the weak references, if any, which point
at an SV.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The
&quot;screaminstr()&quot; function has been removed.
Although marked as public API, it was undocumented and had
no usage in CPAN modules. Calling it has been fatal since
5.17.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The
&quot;newDEFSVOP()&quot;, &quot;block_start()&quot;,
&quot;block_end()&quot; and &quot;intro_my()&quot; functions
have been added to the API.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The internal
&quot;convert&quot; function in op.c has been renamed
&quot;op_convert_list&quot; and added to the API.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The
&quot;sv_magic()&quot; function no longer forbids
&quot;ext&quot; magic on read-only values. After all, perl
can&rsquo;t know whether the custom magic will modify the SV
or not. [perl #123103] <br>

&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123103&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Accessing
&quot;CvPADLIST&quot; in perlapi on an XSUB is now
forbidden.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;CvPADLIST&quot; field
has been reused for a different internal purpose for XSUBs.
So in particular, you can no longer rely on it being NULL as
a test of whether a CV is an <br>
XSUB. Use &quot;CvISXSUB()&quot; instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; SVs of type
&quot;SVt_NV&quot; are now sometimes bodiless when the build
configuration and platform allow it: specifically, when
&quot;sizeof(NV) &lt;= sizeof(IV)&quot;.
&quot;Bodiless&quot; means that the <br>
NV value is stored directly in the head of an SV, without
requiring a separate body to be allocated. This trick has
already been used for IVs since 5.9.2 (though in the case
<br>
of IVs, it is always used, regardless of platform and build
configuration).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The $DB::single,
$DB::signal and $DB::trace variables now have set- and
get-magic that stores their values as IVs, and those IVs are
used when testing their values in <br>
&quot;pp_dbstate()&quot;. This prevents perl from recursing
infinitely if an overloaded object is assigned to any of
those variables. [perl #122445] <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;Perl_tmps_grow()&quot;, which is marked as public API
but is undocumented, has been removed from the public API.
This change does not affect XS code that uses the
&quot;EXTEND_MORTAL&quot; <br>
macro to pre-extend the mortal stack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Perl&rsquo;s
internals no longer sets or uses the &quot;SVs_PADMY&quot;
flag. &quot;SvPADMY()&quot; now returns a true value for
anything not marked &quot;PADTMP&quot; and
&quot;SVs_PADMY&quot; is now defined as 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The macros
&quot;SETsv&quot; and &quot;SETsvUN&quot; have been removed.
They were no longer used in the core since commit 6f1401dc2a
five years ago, and have not been found present on CPAN.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The
&quot;SvFAKE&quot; bit (unused on HVs) got informally
reserved by David Mitchell for future work on vtables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The
&quot;sv_catpvn_flags()&quot; function accepts
&quot;SV_CATBYTES&quot; and &quot;SV_CATUTF8&quot; flags,
which specify whether the appended string is bytes or UTF-8,
respectively. (These flags have in <br>
fact been present since 5.16.0, but were formerly not
regarded as part of the API.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A new opcode
class, &quot;METHOP&quot;, has been introduced. It holds
information used at runtime to improve the performance of
class/object method calls.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;OP_METHOD&quot; and
&quot;OP_METHOD_NAMED&quot; have changed from being
&quot;UNOP/SVOP&quot; to being &quot;METHOP&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;cv_name()&quot; is a new API function that can be
passed a CV or GV. It returns an SV containing the name of
the subroutine, for use in diagnostics.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;cv_set_call_checker_flags()&quot; is a new API
function that works like &quot;cv_set_call_checker()&quot;,
except that it allows the caller to specify whether the call
checker requires a <br>
full GV for reporting the subroutine&rsquo;s name, or
whether it could be passed a CV instead. Whatever value is
passed will be acceptable to &quot;cv_name()&quot;.
&quot;cv_set_call_checker()&quot; <br>
guarantees there will be a GV, but it may have to create one
on the fly, which is inefficient. [perl #116735]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=116735&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &quot;CvGV&quot;
(which is not part of the API) is now a more complex macro,
which may call a function and reify a GV. For those cases
where it has been used as a boolean, &quot;CvHASGV&quot;
<br>
has been added, which will return true for CVs that
notionally have GVs, but without reifying the GV.
&quot;CvGV&quot; also returns a GV now for lexical subs.

&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=120441&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The
&quot;sync_locale&quot; in perlapi function has been added
to the public API. Changing the program&rsquo;s locale
should be avoided by XS code. Nevertheless, certain non-Perl
libraries <br>
called from XS need to do so, such as &quot;Gtk&quot;. When
this happens, Perl needs to be told that the locale has
changed. Use this function to do so, before returning to
Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The defines and
labels for the flags in the &quot;op_private&quot; field of
OPs are now auto-generated from data in regen/op_private.
The noticeable effect of this is that some of the <br>
flag output of &quot;Concise&quot; might differ slightly,
and the flag output of &quot;perl -Dx&quot; may differ
considerably (they both use the same set of labels now).
Also, debugging builds <br>
now have a new assertion in &quot;op_free()&quot; to ensure
that the op doesn&rsquo;t have any unrecognized flags set in
&quot;op_private&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The deprecated
variable &quot;PL_sv_objcount&quot; has been removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Perl now tries
to keep the locale category &quot;LC_NUMERIC&quot; set to
&quot;C&quot; except around operations that need it to be
set to the program&rsquo;s underlying locale. This protects
the many <br>
XS modules that cannot cope with the decimal radix character
not being a dot. Prior to this release, Perl initialized
this category to &quot;C&quot;, but a call to <br>
&quot;POSIX::setlocale()&quot; would change it. Now such a
call will change the underlying locale of the
&quot;LC_NUMERIC&quot; category for the program, but the
locale exposed to XS code will <br>
remain &quot;C&quot;. There are new macros to manipulate the
LC_NUMERIC locale, including
&quot;STORE_LC_NUMERIC_SET_TO_NEEDED&quot; and
&quot;STORE_LC_NUMERIC_FORCE_TO_UNDERLYING&quot;. See
&quot;Locale- <br>
related functions and macros&quot; in perlapi.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A new macro
&quot;isUTF8_CHAR&quot; has been written which efficiently
determines if the string given by its parameters begins with
a well-formed UTF-8 encoded character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The following
private API functions had their context parameter removed:
&quot;Perl_cast_ulong&quot;, &quot;Perl_cast_i32&quot;,
&quot;Perl_cast_iv&quot;, &quot;Perl_cast_uv&quot;,
&quot;Perl_cv_const_sv&quot;, <br>
&quot;Perl_mg_find&quot;, &quot;Perl_mg_findext&quot;,
&quot;Perl_mg_magical&quot;, &quot;Perl_mini_mktime&quot;,
&quot;Perl_my_dirfd&quot;, &quot;Perl_sv_backoff&quot;,
&quot;Perl_utf8_hop&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the prefix-less
versions of those functions that are part of the public API,
such as &quot;cast_i32()&quot;, remain unaffected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The
&quot;PADNAME&quot; and &quot;PADNAMELIST&quot; types are
now separate types, and no longer simply aliases for SV and
AV. [perl #123223]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123223&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Pad names are
now always UTF-8. The &quot;PadnameUTF8&quot; macro always
returns true. Previously, this was effectively the case
already, but any support for two different internal <br>
representations of pad names has now been removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A new op class,
&quot;UNOP_AUX&quot;, has been added. This is a subclass of
&quot;UNOP&quot; with an &quot;op_aux&quot; field added,
which points to an array of unions of UV, SV* etc. It is
intended for <br>
where an op needs to store more data than a simple
&quot;op_sv&quot; or whatever. Currently the only op of this
type is &quot;OP_MULTIDEREF&quot; (see next item).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A new op has
been added, &quot;OP_MULTIDEREF&quot;, which performs one or
more nested array and hash lookups where the key is a
constant or simple variable. For example the expression <br>
$a[0]{$k}[$i], which previously involved ten
&quot;rv2Xv&quot;, &quot;Xelem&quot;, &quot;gvsv&quot; and
&quot;const&quot; ops is now performed by a single
&quot;multideref&quot; op. It can also handle
&quot;local&quot;, &quot;exists&quot; and <br>
&quot;delete&quot;. A non-simple index expression, such as
&quot;[$i+1]&quot; is still done using
&quot;aelem&quot;/&quot;helem&quot;, and single-level array
lookup with a small constant index is still done using <br>
&quot;aelemfast&quot;.</p>

Previously, the value of $! would be <br>

writing &quot;close $fh or die $!&quot; did not work

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Some cases of

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; When trying to

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Certain syntax

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; In Perl 5.20.0,
$^N accidentally had the internal UTF-8 flag turned off if

effectively UTF-8-encoding the value. This <br>
has been fixed. [perl #123135]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123135&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A failed
&quot;semctl&quot; call no longer overwrites existing items

&quot;(semctl(-1,0,0,0))[0]&quot; no longer gives an
&quot;uninitialized&quot; warning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;else{foo()}&quot; with no space before &quot;foo&quot;
is now better at assigning the right line number to that
statement. [perl #122695] <br>

&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=122695&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Sometimes the
assignment in &quot;@array = split&quot; gets optimised so
that &quot;split&quot; itself writes directly to the array.
This caused a bug, preventing this assignment from being
<br>
used in lvalue context. So
&quot;(@a=split//,&quot;foo&quot;)=bar()&quot; was an error.
(This bug probably goes back to Perl 3, when the
optimisation was added.) It has now been fixed. [perl <br>
#123057]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123057&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; When an argument
list fails the checks specified by a subroutine signature
(which is still an experimental feature), the resulting
error messages now give the file and line <br>
number of the caller, not of the called subroutine. [perl
#121374]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=121374&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The flip-flop
operators (&quot;..&quot; and &quot;...&quot; in scalar
context) used to maintain a separate state for each
recursion level (the number of times the enclosing sub was
called <br>
recursively), contrary to the documentation. Now each
closure has one internal state for each flip-flop. [perl
#122829]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=122829&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The flip-flop
operator (&quot;..&quot; in scalar context) would return the
same scalar each time, unless the containing subroutine was
called recursively. Now it always returns a new <br>
scalar. [perl #122829]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=122829&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &quot;use&quot;,
&quot;no&quot;, statement labels, special blocks
(&quot;BEGIN&quot;) and pod are now permitted as the first
thing in a &quot;map&quot; or &quot;grep&quot; block, the
block after &quot;print&quot; or &quot;say&quot; (or other
<br>
functions) returning a handle, and within
&quot;${...}&quot;, &quot;@{...}&quot;, etc. [perl #122782]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=122782&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The repetition
operator &quot;x&quot; now propagates lvalue context to its
left-hand argument when used in contexts like
&quot;foreach&quot;. That allows &quot;for(($#that_array)x2)
{ ... }&quot; to work <br>
as expected if the loop modifies $_.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &quot;(...) x
...&quot; in scalar context used to corrupt the stack if one
operand was an object with &quot;x&quot; overloading,
causing erratic behavior. [perl #121827] <br>

&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=121827&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Assignment to a
lexical scalar is often optimised away; for example in
&quot;my $x; $x = $y + $z&quot;, the assign operator is
optimised away and the add operator writes its result <br>
directly to $x. Various bugs related to this optimisation
have been fixed. Certain operators on the right-hand side
would sometimes fail to assign the value at all or <br>
assign the wrong value, or would call STORE twice or not at
all on tied variables. The operators affected were
&quot;$foo++&quot;, &quot;$foo--&quot;, and
&quot;-$foo&quot; under &quot;use integer&quot;,
&quot;chomp&quot;, <br>
&quot;chr&quot; and &quot;setpgrp&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; List assignments
were sometimes buggy if the same scalar ended up on both
sides of the assignment due to use of &quot;tied&quot;,
&quot;values&quot; or &quot;each&quot;. The result would be
the wrong <br>
value getting assigned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;setpgrp($nonzero)&quot; (with one argument) was
accidentally changed in 5.16 to mean setpgrp(0). This has
been fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;__SUB__&quot; could return the wrong value or even
corrupt memory under the debugger (the &quot;-d&quot;
switch) and in subs containing &quot;eval $string&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; When &quot;sub
() { $var }&quot; becomes inlinable, it now returns a
different scalar each time, just as a non-inlinable sub
would, though Perl still optimises the copy away in cases
<br>
where it would make no observable difference.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &quot;my sub f
() { $var }&quot; and &quot;sub () : attr { $var }&quot; are
no longer eligible for inlining. The former would crash; the
latter would just throw the attributes away. An <br>
exception is made for the little-known &quot;:method&quot;
attribute, which does nothing much.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Inlining of subs
with an empty prototype is now more consistent than before.
Previously, a sub with multiple statements, of which all but
the last were optimised away, would <br>
be inlinable only if it were an anonymous sub containing a
string &quot;eval&quot; or &quot;state&quot; declaration or
closing over an outer lexical variable (or any anonymous sub
under the <br>
debugger). Now any sub that gets folded to a single constant
after statements have been optimised away is eligible for
inlining. This applies to things like &quot;sub () { <br>
jabber() if DEBUG; 42 }&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some subroutines with an
explicit &quot;return&quot; were being made inlinable,
contrary to the documentation, Now &quot;return&quot; always
prevents inlining.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; On some systems,
such as VMS, &quot;crypt&quot; can return a non-ASCII
string. If a scalar assigned to had contained a UTF-8 string
previously, then &quot;crypt&quot; would not turn off the
<br>
UTF-8 flag, thus corrupting the return value. This would
happen with &quot;$lexical = crypt ...&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;crypt&quot; no longer calls &quot;FETCH&quot; twice on
a tied first argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; An unterminated
here-doc on the last line of a quote-like operator
(&quot;qq[${ &lt;&lt;END }]&quot;, &quot;/(?{ &lt;&lt;END
})/&quot;) no longer causes a double free. It started doing
so in 5.18.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;index()&quot; and &quot;rindex()&quot; no longer crash
when used on strings over 2GB in size. [perl #121562]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=121562&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A small,
previously intentional, memory leak in
&quot;PERL_SYS_INIT&quot;/&quot;PERL_SYS_INIT3&quot; on
Win32 builds was fixed. This might affect embedders who
repeatedly create and destroy perl <br>
engines within the same process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;POSIX::localeconv()&quot; now returns the data for the
program&rsquo;s underlying locale even when called from
outside the scope of &quot;use locale&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;POSIX::localeconv()&quot; now works properly on
platforms which don&rsquo;t have &quot;LC_NUMERIC&quot;
and/or &quot;LC_MONETARY&quot;, or for which Perl has been
compiled to disregard either or both of <br>
these locale categories. In such circumstances, there are
now no entries for the corresponding values in the hash
returned by &quot;localeconv()&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;POSIX::localeconv()&quot; now marks appropriately the
values it returns as UTF-8 or not. Previously they were
always returned as bytes, even if they were supposed to be
encoded <br>
as UTF-8.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; On Microsoft
Windows, within the scope of &quot;use locale&quot;, the
following POSIX character classes gave results for many
locales that did not conform to the POSIX standard: <br>
&quot;[[:alnum:]]&quot;, &quot;[[:alpha:]]&quot;,
&quot;[[:blank:]]&quot;, &quot;[[:digit:]]&quot;,
&quot;[[:graph:]]&quot;, &quot;[[:lower:]]&quot;,
&quot;[[:print:]]&quot;, &quot;[[:punct:]]&quot;,
&quot;[[:upper:]]&quot;, &quot;[[:word:]]&quot;, and
&quot;[[:xdigit:]]&quot;. This <br>
was because the underlying Microsoft implementation does not
follow the standard. Perl now takes special precautions to
correct for this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Many issues have
been detected by Coverity &lt;http://www.coverity.com/&gt;
and fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;system()&quot; and friends should now work properly on
more Android builds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Due to an oversight, the value
specified through &quot;-Dtargetsh&quot; to Configure would
end up being ignored by some of the build process. This
caused perls cross-compiled for <br>
Android to end up with defective versions of
&quot;system()&quot;, &quot;exec()&quot; and backticks: the
commands would end up looking for &quot;/bin/sh&quot;
instead of &quot;/system/bin/sh&quot;, and so would <br>
fail for the vast majority of devices, leaving $! as
&quot;ENOENT&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;qr(.......)&quot;, &quot;qr[......]&quot;, and
&quot;qr{.........}&quot; now work. Previously it was
impossible to escape these three left-characters with a
backslash within a <br>
regular expression pattern where otherwise they would be
considered metacharacters, and the pattern opening delimiter
was the character, and the closing delimiter was its <br>
mirror character.</p>

if they begin with an opening brace. [perl #46947]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=46947&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; External
libraries and Perl may have different ideas of what the
locale is. This is problematic when parsing version strings
if the locale&rsquo;s numeric separator has been <br>
changed. Version parsing has been patched to ensure it
handles the locales correctly. [perl #121930]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=121930&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A bug has been
fixed where zero-length assertions and code blocks inside of
a regex could cause &quot;pos&quot; to see an incorrect
value. [perl #122460] <br>

&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=122460&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Dereferencing of
constants now works correctly for typeglob constants.
Previously the glob was stringified and its name looked up.
Now the glob itself is used. [perl <br>
#69456]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=69456&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; When parsing a
sigil (&quot;$&quot; &quot;@&quot; &quot;%&quot;
&quot;&amp;)&quot; followed by braces, the parser no longer
tries to guess whether it is a block or a hash constructor
(causing a syntax error when it <br>
guesses the latter), since it can only be a block.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &quot;undef
$reference&quot; now frees the referent immediately, instead
of hanging on to it until the next statement. [perl #122556]
<br>

&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=122556&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Various cases
where the name of a sub is used (autoload, overloading,
error messages) used to crash for lexical subs, but have
been fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Bareword lookup
now tries to avoid vivifying packages if it turns out the
bareword is not going to be a subroutine name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Compilation of
anonymous constants (e.g., &quot;sub () { 3 }&quot;) no
longer deletes any subroutine named &quot;__ANON__&quot; in
the current package. Not only was
&quot;*__ANON__{CODE}&quot; cleared, <br>
but there was a memory leak, too. This bug goes back to Perl
5.8.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Stub
declarations like &quot;sub f;&quot; and &quot;sub f
();&quot; no longer wipe out constants of the same name
declared by &quot;use constant&quot;. This bug was
introduced in Perl 5.10.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &quot;qr/[amed
sequence}]/&quot; now works properly in many instances.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some names known to
&quot; refer to a sequence of multiple characters,
instead of the usual single character. Bracketed character
classes generally only match single <br>
characters, but now special handling has been added so that
they can match named sequences, but not if the class is
inverted or the sequence is specified as the beginning or
<br>
end of a range. In these cases, the only behavior change
from before is a slight rewording of the fatal error message
given when this class is part of a &quot;?[...])&quot;
construct. <br>
When the &quot;[...]&quot; stands alone, the same non-fatal
warning as before is raised, and only the first character in
the sequence is used, again just as before.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Tainted
constants evaluated at compile time no longer cause
unrelated statements to become tainted. [perl #122669]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=122669&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &quot;open $$fh,
...&quot;, which vivifies a handle with a name like
&quot;main::_GEN_0&quot;, was not giving the handle the
right reference count, so a double free could happen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; When deciding
that a bareword was a method name, the parser would get
confused if an &quot;our&quot; sub with the same name
existed, and look up the method in the package of the
&quot;our&quot; <br>
sub, instead of the package of the invocant.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The parser no
longer gets confused by &quot;U=&quot; within a
double-quoted string. It used to produce a syntax error, but
now compiles it correctly. [perl #80368] <br>

&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=80368&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; It has always
been the intention for the &quot;-B&quot; and &quot;-T&quot;
file test operators to treat UTF-8 encoded files as text.
(perlfunc has been updated to say this.) Previously, it was
<br>
possible for some files to be considered UTF-8 that actually
weren&rsquo;t valid UTF-8. This is now fixed. The operators
now work on EBCDIC platforms as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Under some
conditions warning messages raised during regular expression
pattern compilation were being output more than once. This
has now been fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Perl 5.20.0
introduced a regression in which a UTF-8 encoded regular
expression pattern that contains a single ASCII lowercase
letter did not match its uppercase counterpart. <br>
That has been fixed in both 5.20.1 and 5.22.0. [perl
#122655]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=122655&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Constant folding
could incorrectly suppress warnings if lexical warnings
(&quot;use warnings&quot; or &quot;no warnings&quot;) were
not in effect and $^W were false at compile time and true at
<br>
run time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Loading Unicode
tables during a regular expression match could cause
assertion failures under debugging builds if the previous
match used the very same regular expression. <br>
[perl #122747]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=122747&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Thread cloning
used to work incorrectly for lexical subs, possibly causing
crashes or double frees on exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Since Perl
5.14.0, deleting $SomePackage::{__ANON__} and then
undefining an anonymous subroutine could corrupt things
internally, resulting in Devel::Peek crashing or B.pm <br>
giving nonsensical data. This has been fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &quot;(caller
$n)[3]&quot; now reports names of lexical subs, instead of
treating them as &quot;(unknown)&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &quot;sort
subname LIST&quot; now supports using a lexical sub as the
comparison routine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Aliasing (e.g.,
via &quot;*x = *y&quot;) could confuse list assignments that
mention the two names for the same variable on either side,
causing wrong values to be assigned. [perl <br>
#15667]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=15667&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Long here-doc
terminators could cause a bad read on short lines of input.
This has been fixed. It is doubtful that any crash could
have occurred. This bug goes back to <br>
when here-docs were introduced in Perl 3.000 twenty-five
years ago.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; An optimization
in &quot;split&quot; to treat &quot;split /^/&quot; like
&quot;split /^/m&quot; had the unfortunate side-effect of
also treating &quot;split /0^/m&quot;, which it should not.
This <br>
has been fixed. (Note, however, that &quot;split /^x/&quot;
does not behave like &quot;split /^x/m&quot;, which is also
considered to be a bug and will be fixed in a future
version.) [perl <br>
#122761]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=122761&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The little-known
&quot;my Class $var&quot; syntax (see fields and attributes)
could get confused in the scope of &quot;use utf8&quot; if
&quot;Class&quot; were a constant whose value contained
Latin-1 <br>
characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Locking and
unlocking values via Hash::Util or
&quot;Internals::SvREADONLY&quot; no longer has any effect
on values that were read-only to begin with. Previously,
unlocking such <br>
values could result in crashes, hangs or other erratic
behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Some
unterminated &quot;(?(...)...)&quot; constructs in regular
expressions would either crash or give erroneous error
messages. &quot;/(?(1)/&quot; is one such example.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &quot;pack
&quot;w&quot;, $tied&quot; no longer calls FETCH twice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; List assignments
like &quot;($x, $z) = (1, $y)&quot; now work correctly if $x
and $y have been aliased by &quot;foreach&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Some patterns
including code blocks with syntax errors, such as &quot;/
(?{(^{})/&quot;, would hang or fail assertions on debugging
builds. Now they produce errors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; An assertion
failure when parsing &quot;sort&quot; with debugging enabled
has been fixed. [perl #122771]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=122771&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &quot;*a = *b;
@a = split //, $b[1]&quot; could do a bad read and produce
junk results.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; In &quot;() =
@array = split&quot;, the &quot;() =&quot; at the beginning
no longer confuses the optimizer into assuming a limit of
1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Fatal warnings
no longer prevent the output of syntax errors. [perl
#122966]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=122966&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Fixed a NaN
double-to-long-double conversion error on VMS. For quiet
NaNs (and only on Itanium, not Alpha) negative infinity
instead of NaN was produced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Fixed the issue
that caused &quot;make distclean&quot; to incorrectly leave
some files behind. [perl #122820]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=122820&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; AIX now sets the
length in &quot;getsockopt&quot; correctly. [perl #120835]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=120835&gt;.
[cpan #91183] <br>
&lt;https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=91183&gt;.
[cpan #85570]
&lt;https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=85570&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The optimization
phase of a regexp compilation could run &quot;forever&quot;
and exhaust all memory under certain circumstances; now
fixed. [perl #122283] <br>

&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=122283&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The test script
t/op/crypt.t now uses the SHA-256 algorithm if the default
one is disabled, rather than giving failures. [perl #121591]
<br>

&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=121591&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Fixed an
off-by-one error when setting the size of a shared array.
[perl #122950]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=122950&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Fixed a bug that
could cause perl to enter an infinite loop during
compilation. In particular, a while(1) within a sublist,
e.g.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sub foo { () = ($a, my $b, ($c,
do { while(1) {} })) }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The bug was introduced in 5.20.0
[perl #122995]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=122995&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; On Win32, if a
variable was &quot;local&quot;-ized in a pseudo-process that
later forked, restoring the original value in the child
pseudo-process caused memory corruption and a crash <br>
in the child pseudo-process (and therefore the OS process).
[perl #40565]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=40565&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Calling
&quot;write&quot; on a format with a &quot;^**&quot; field
could produce a panic in &quot;sv_chop()&quot; if there were
insufficient arguments or if the variable used to fill the
field was empty. <br>
[perl #123245]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123245&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Non-ASCII
lexical sub names now appear without trailing junk when they
appear in error messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The
&quot;@&quot; subroutine prototype no longer flattens
parenthesized arrays (taking a reference to each element),
but takes a reference to the array itself. [perl #47363]
<br>

&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=47363&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A block
containing nothing except a C-style &quot;for&quot; loop
could corrupt the stack, causing lists outside the block to
lose elements or have elements overwritten. This could <br>
happen with &quot;map { for(...){...} } ...&quot; and with
lists containing &quot;do { for(...){...} }&quot;. [perl
#123286]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123286&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;scalar()&quot; now propagates lvalue context, so that
&quot;for(scalar($#foo)) { ... }&quot; can modify $#foo
through $_.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;qr/@array(?{block})/&quot; no longer dies with
&quot;Bizarre copy of ARRAY&quot;. [perl #123344]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123344&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &quot;eval
&rsquo;$variable&rsquo;&quot; in nested named subroutines
would sometimes look up a global variable even with a
lexical variable in scope.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; In perl 5.20.0,
&quot;sort CORE::fake&quot; where &rsquo;fake&rsquo; is
anything other than a keyword, started chopping off the last
6 characters and treating the result as a sort sub name. The
<br>
previous behavior of treating &quot;CORE::fake&quot; as a
sort sub name has been restored. [perl #123410]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123410&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Outside of
&quot;use utf8&quot;, a single-character Latin-1 lexical
variable is disallowed. The error message for it,
&quot;Can&rsquo;t use global $foo...&quot;, was giving
garbage instead of the <br>
variable name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;readline&quot; on a nonexistent handle was causing
&quot;${^LAST_FH}&quot; to produce a reference to an
undefined scalar (or fail an assertion). Now
&quot;${^LAST_FH}&quot; ends up undefined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &quot;(...) x
...&quot; in void context now applies scalar context to the
left-hand argument, instead of the context the current sub
was called in. [perl #123020] <br>

&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123020&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Known Problems <br>
&Acirc;&middot; &quot;pack&quot;-ing a NaN on a perl
compiled with Visual C 6 does not behave properly, leading
to a test failure in t/op/infnan.t. [perl 125203] <br>

&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=125203&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A goal is for
Perl to be able to be recompiled to work reasonably well on
any Unicode version. In Perl 5.22, though, the earliest such
version is Unicode 5.1 (current is <br>
7.0).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; EBCDIC
platforms</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The
&quot;cmp&quot; (and hence &quot;sort&quot;) operators do
not necessarily give the correct results when both operands
are UTF-EBCDIC encoded strings and there is a mixture of
ASCII <br>
and/or control characters, along with other characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Ranges
containing &quot; in the &quot;tr///&quot; (and
&quot;y///&quot;) transliteration operators are treated
differently than the equivalent ranges in regular expression
patterns. They <br>
should, but don&rsquo;t, cause the values in the ranges to
all be treated as Unicode code points, and not native ones.
(&quot;Version 8 Regular Expressions&quot; in perlre gives
details <br>
as to how it should work.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Encode and
encoding are mostly broken.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Many CPAN
modules that are shipped with core show failing tests.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;pack&quot;/&quot;unpack&quot; with &quot;U0&quot;
format may not work properly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The following
modules are known to have test failures with this version of
Perl. In many cases, patches have been submitted, so there
will hopefully be new releases soon:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Obituary <br>
Brian McCauley died on May 8, 2015. He was a frequent poster
to Usenet, Perl Monks, and other Perl forums, and made
several CPAN contributions under the nick NOBULL, including
<br>
to the Perl FAQ. He attended almost every YAPC::Europe, and
indeed, helped organise YAPC::Europe 2006 and the QA
Hackathon 2009. His wit and his delight in intricate systems
<br>
were particularly apparent in his love of board games; many
Perl mongers will have fond memories of playing Fluxx and
other games with Brian. He will be missed.</p>
