perl5220delta - what is new for perl v5.22.0
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
This document describes differences between the 5.20.0 release and the 5.22.0
  release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.18.0, first read
  perl5200delta, which describes differences between 5.18.0 and 5.20.0.

  Enhancements</a></h1>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="New_bitwise_operators"><a class="selflink" href="#New_bitwise_operators">New
  bitwise operators</a></h2>
A new experimental facility has been added that makes the four standard bitwise
  operators (&quot;&amp; | ^ ~&quot;) treat their operands consistently as
  numbers, and introduces four new dotted operators (&quot;&amp;. |. ^.
  ~.&quot;) that treat their operands consistently as strings. The same applies
  to the assignment variants (&quot;&amp;= |= ^= &amp;.= |.= ^.=&quot;).
<div class="Pp"></div>
To use this, enable the &quot;bitwise&quot; feature and disable the
  &quot;experimental::bitwise&quot; warnings category. See &quot;Bitwise String
  Operators&quot; in perlop for details. [perl #123466]
  &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123466&gt;.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="New_double-diamond_operator"><a class="selflink" href="#New_double-diamond_operator">New
  double-diamond operator</a></h2>
&quot;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&quot; is like &quot;&lt;&gt;&quot; but uses
  three-argument &quot;open&quot; to open each file in @ARGV. This means that
  each element of @ARGV will be treated as an actual file name, and
  &quot;|foo&quot; won't be treated as a pipe open.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="New_&quot;\b&quot;_boundaries_in_regular_expressions"><a class="selflink" href="#New_&quot;\b&quot;_boundaries_in_regular_expressions">New
  &quot;\b&quot; boundaries in regular expressions</a></h2>
<i></i><i>&quot;qr/\b{gcb}/&quot;</i><i></i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;gcb&quot; stands for Grapheme Cluster Boundary. It is a Unicode property
  that finds the boundary between sequences of characters that look like a
  single character to a native speaker of a language. Perl has long had the
  ability to deal with these through the &quot;\X&quot; regular escape sequence.
  Now, there is an alternative way of handling these. See &quot;\b{}, \b, \B{},
  \B&quot; in perlrebackslash for details.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i></i><i>&quot;qr/\b{wb}/&quot;</i><i></i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;wb&quot; stands for Word Boundary. It is a Unicode property that finds the
  boundary between words. This is similar to the plain &quot;\b&quot; (without
  braces) but is more suitable for natural language processing. It knows, for
  example, that apostrophes can occur in the middle of words. See &quot;\b{},
  \b, \B{}, \B&quot; in perlrebackslash for details.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i></i><i>&quot;qr/\b{sb}/&quot;</i><i></i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;sb&quot; stands for Sentence Boundary. It is a Unicode property to aid in
  parsing natural language sentences. See &quot;\b{}, \b, \B{}, \B&quot; in
  perlrebackslash for details.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Non-Capturing_Regular_Expression_Flag"><a class="selflink" href="#Non-Capturing_Regular_Expression_Flag">Non-Capturing
  Regular Expression Flag</a></h2>
Regular expressions now support a &quot;/n&quot; flag that disables capturing
  and filling in $1, $2, etc inside of groups:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  &quot;hello&quot; =~ /(hi|hello)/n; # $1 is not set
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This is equivalent to putting &quot;?:&quot; at the beginning of every capturing
  group.
<div class="Pp"></div>
See &quot;n&quot; in perlre for more information.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="&quot;use_re_'strict'&quot;"><a class="selflink" href="#&quot;use_re_'strict'&quot;">&quot;use
  re 'strict'&quot;</a></h2>
This applies stricter syntax rules to regular expression patterns compiled
  within its scope. This will hopefully alert you to typos and other
  unintentional behavior that backwards-compatibility issues prevent us from
  reporting in normal regular expression compilations. Because the behavior of
  this is subject to change in future Perl releases as we gain experience, using
  this pragma will raise a warning of category
  &quot;experimental::re_strict&quot;. See 'strict' in re.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Unicode_7.0_(with_correction)_is_now_supported"><a class="selflink" href="#Unicode_7.0_(with_correction)_is_now_supported">Unicode
  7.0 (with correction) is now supported</a></h2>
For details on what is in this release, see
  &lt;http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode7.0.0/&gt;. The version of Unicode
  7.0 that comes with Perl includes a correction dealing with glyph shaping in
  Arabic (see &lt;http://www.unicode.org/errata/#current_errata&gt;).
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="&quot;use_locale&quot;_can_restrict_which_locale_categories_are_affected"><a class="selflink" href="#&quot;use_locale&quot;_can_restrict_which_locale_categories_are_affected">&quot;use&#x00A0;locale&quot;
  can restrict which locale categories are affected</a></h2>
It is now possible to pass a parameter to &quot;use&#x00A0;locale&quot; to
  specify a subset of locale categories to be locale-aware, with the remaining
  ones unaffected. See &quot;The &quot;use locale&quot; pragma&quot; in
  perllocale for details.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Perl_now_supports_POSIX_2008_locale_currency_additions"><a class="selflink" href="#Perl_now_supports_POSIX_2008_locale_currency_additions">Perl
  now supports POSIX 2008 locale currency additions</a></h2>
On platforms that are able to handle POSIX.1-2008, the hash returned by
  &quot;POSIX::localeconv()&quot; includes the international currency fields
  added by that version of the POSIX standard. These are
  &quot;int_n_cs_precedes&quot;, &quot;int_n_sep_by_space&quot;,
  &quot;int_n_sign_posn&quot;, &quot;int_p_cs_precedes&quot;,
  &quot;int_p_sep_by_space&quot;, and &quot;int_p_sign_posn&quot;.

  heuristics on older platforms for determining locale UTF-8ness</a></h2>
On platforms that implement neither the C99 standard nor the POSIX 2001
  standard, determining if the current locale is UTF-8 or not depends on
  heuristics. These are improved in this release.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Aliasing_via_reference"><a class="selflink" href="#Aliasing_via_reference">Aliasing
  via reference</a></h2>
Variables and subroutines can now be aliased by assigning to a reference:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    \$c = \$d;
    \&amp;x = \&amp;y;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Aliasing can also be accomplished by using a backslash before a
  &quot;foreach&quot; iterator variable; this is perhaps the most useful idiom
  this feature provides:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    foreach \%hash (@array_of_hash_refs) { ... }
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This feature is experimental and must be enabled via
  &quot;use&#x00A0;feature&#x00A0;'refaliasing'&quot;. It will warn unless the
  &quot;experimental::refaliasing&quot; warnings category is disabled.
<div class="Pp"></div>

<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="&quot;prototype&quot;_with_no_arguments"><a class="selflink" href="#&quot;prototype&quot;_with_no_arguments">&quot;prototype&quot;
  with no arguments</a></h2>
&quot;prototype()&quot; with no arguments now infers $_. [perl #123514]
  &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123514&gt;.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="New_&quot;:const&quot;_subroutine_attribute"><a class="selflink" href="#New_&quot;:const&quot;_subroutine_attribute">New
  &quot;:const&quot; subroutine attribute</a></h2>
The &quot;const&quot; attribute can be applied to an anonymous subroutine. It
  causes the new sub to be executed immediately whenever one is created (
  <i>i.e.</i> when the &quot;sub&quot; expression is evaluated). Its value is
  captured and used to create a new constant subroutine that is returned. This
  feature is experimental. See &quot;Constant Functions&quot; in perlsub.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="&quot;fileno&quot;_now_works_on_directory_handles"><a class="selflink" href="#&quot;fileno&quot;_now_works_on_directory_handles">&quot;fileno&quot;
  now works on directory handles</a></h2>
When the relevant support is available in the operating system, the
  &quot;fileno&quot; builtin now works on directory handles, yielding the
  underlying file descriptor in the same way as for filehandles. On operating
  systems without such support, &quot;fileno&quot; on a directory handle
  continues to return the undefined value, as before, but also sets $! to
  indicate that the operation is not supported.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Currently, this uses either a &quot;dd_fd&quot; member in the OS &quot;DIR&quot;
  structure, or a dirfd(3) function as specified by POSIX.1-2008.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="List_form_of_pipe_open_implemented_for_Win32"><a class="selflink" href="#List_form_of_pipe_open_implemented_for_Win32">List
  form of pipe open implemented for Win32</a></h2>
The list form of pipe:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  open my $fh, &quot;-|&quot;, &quot;program&quot;, @arguments;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
is now implemented on Win32. It has the same limitations as &quot;system
  LIST&quot; on Win32, since the Win32 API doesn't accept program arguments as a
  list.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Assignment_to_list_repetition"><a class="selflink" href="#Assignment_to_list_repetition">Assignment
  to list repetition</a></h2>
&quot;(...) x ...&quot; can now be used within a list that is assigned to, as
  long as the left-hand side is a valid lvalue. This allows
  &quot;(undef,undef,$foo)&#x00A0;=&#x00A0;that_function()&quot; to be written
  as &quot;((undef)x2,&#x00A0;$foo)&#x00A0;=&#x00A0;that_function()&quot;.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Infinity_and_NaN_(not-a-number)_handling_improved"><a class="selflink" href="#Infinity_and_NaN_(not-a-number)_handling_improved">Infinity
  and NaN (not-a-number) handling improved</a></h2>
Floating point values are able to hold the special values infinity, negative
  infinity, and NaN (not-a-number). Now we more robustly recognize and propagate
  the value in computations, and on output normalize them to the strings
  &quot;Inf&quot;, &quot;-Inf&quot;, and &quot;NaN&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
See also the POSIX enhancements.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Floating_point_parsing_has_been_improved"><a class="selflink" href="#Floating_point_parsing_has_been_improved">Floating
  point parsing has been improved</a></h2>
Parsing and printing of floating point values has been improved.
<div class="Pp"></div>
As a completely new feature, hexadecimal floating point literals (like
  &quot;0x1.23p-4&quot;) are now supported, and they can be output with
  &quot;printf&#x00A0;&quot;%a&quot;&quot;. See &quot;Scalar value
  constructors&quot; in perldata for more details.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Packing_infinity_or_not-a-number_into_a_character_is_now_fatal"><a class="selflink" href="#Packing_infinity_or_not-a-number_into_a_character_is_now_fatal">Packing
  infinity or not-a-number into a character is now fatal</a></h2>
Before, when trying to pack infinity or not-a-number into a (signed) character,
  Perl would warn, and assumed you tried to pack 0xFF; if you gave it as an
  argument to &quot;chr&quot;, &quot;U+FFFD&quot; was returned.
<div class="Pp"></div>
But now, all such actions (&quot;pack&quot;, &quot;chr&quot;, and &quot;print
  '%c'&quot;) result in a fatal error.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Experimental_C_Backtrace_API"><a class="selflink" href="#Experimental_C_Backtrace_API">Experimental
  C Backtrace API</a></h2>
Perl now supports (via a C level API) retrieving the C level backtrace (similar
  to what symbolic debuggers like gdb do).
<div class="Pp"></div>
The backtrace returns the stack trace of the C call frames, with the symbol
  names (function names), the object names (like &quot;perl&quot;), and if it
  can, also the source code locations (file:line).
<div class="Pp"></div>
The supported platforms are Linux and OS X (some *BSD might work at least
  partly, but they have not yet been tested).
<div class="Pp"></div>
The feature needs to be enabled with &quot;Configure -Dusecbacktrace&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
See &quot;C backtrace&quot; in perlhacktips for more information.

  is now compiled with &quot;-fstack-protector-strong&quot; if

Perl has been compiled with the anti-stack-smashing option
  &quot;-fstack-protector&quot; since 5.10.1. Now Perl uses the newer variant
  called &quot;-fstack-protector-strong&quot;, if available.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="The_Safe_module_could_allow_outside_packages_to_be_replaced"><a class="selflink" href="#The_Safe_module_could_allow_outside_packages_to_be_replaced">The
  Safe module could allow outside packages to be replaced</a></h2>
Critical bugfix: outside packages could be replaced. Safe has been patched to
  2.38 to address this.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Perl_is_now_always_compiled_with_&quot;-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2&quot;_if_available"><a class="selflink" href="#Perl_is_now_always_compiled_with_&quot;-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2&quot;_if_available">Perl
  is now always compiled with &quot;-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2&quot; if
  available</a></h2>
The 'code hardening' option called &quot;_FORTIFY_SOURCE&quot;, available in gcc
  4.*, is now always used for compiling Perl, if available.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that this isn't necessarily a huge step since in many platforms the step
  had already been taken several years ago: many Linux distributions (like
  Fedora) have been using this option for Perl, and OS X has enforced the same
  for many years.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Incompatible_Changes"><a class="selflink" href="#Incompatible_Changes">Incompatible

<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Subroutine_signatures_moved_before_attributes"><a class="selflink" href="#Subroutine_signatures_moved_before_attributes">Subroutine
  signatures moved before attributes</a></h2>
The experimental sub signatures feature, as introduced in 5.20, parsed
  signatures after attributes. In this release, following feedback from users of
  the experimental feature, the positioning has been moved such that signatures
  occur after the subroutine name (if any) and before the attribute list (if
  any).
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="&quot;&amp;&quot;_and_&quot;\&amp;&quot;_prototypes_accepts_only_subs"><a class="selflink" href="#&quot;&amp;&quot;_and_&quot;\&amp;&quot;_prototypes_accepts_only_subs">&quot;&amp;&quot;
  and &quot;\&amp;&quot; prototypes accepts only subs</a></h2>
The &quot;&amp;&quot; prototype character now accepts only anonymous subs
  (&quot;sub {...}&quot;), things beginning with &quot;\&amp;&quot;, or an
  explicit &quot;undef&quot;. Formerly it erroneously also allowed references to
  arrays, hashes, and lists. [perl #4539]
  &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=4539&gt;. [perl #123062]
  &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123062&gt;. [perl #123062]
  &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123475&gt;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In addition, the &quot;\&amp;&quot; prototype was allowing subroutine calls,
  whereas now it only allows subroutines: &amp;foo is still permitted as an
  argument, while &quot;&amp;foo()&quot; and &quot;foo()&quot; no longer are.
  [perl #77860] &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=77860&gt;.

The encoding pragma's effect is now limited to lexical scope. This pragma is
  deprecated, but in the meantime, it could adversely affect unrelated modules
  that are included in the same program; this change fixes that.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="List_slices_returning_empty_lists"><a class="selflink" href="#List_slices_returning_empty_lists">List
  slices returning empty lists</a></h2>
List slices now return an empty list only if the original list was empty (or if
  there are no indices). Formerly, a list slice would return an empty list if
  all indices fell outside the original list; now it returns a list of
  &quot;undef&quot; values in that case. [perl #114498]

Importing functions from &quot;UNIVERSAL&quot; has been deprecated since v5.12,

  now ignores all Unicode pattern white space</a></h2>
The &quot;/x&quot; regular expression modifier allows the pattern to contain
  white space and comments (both of which are ignored) for improved readability.
  Until now, not all the white space characters that Unicode designates for this
  purpose were handled. The additional ones now recognized are:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    U+0085 NEXT LINE
    U+200E LEFT-TO-RIGHT MARK
    U+200F RIGHT-TO-LEFT MARK
    U+2028 LINE SEPARATOR
    U+2029 PARAGRAPH SEPARATOR
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The use of these characters with &quot;/x&quot; outside bracketed character
  classes and when not preceded by a backslash has raised a deprecation warning
  since v5.18. Now they will be ignored.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Comment_lines_within_&quot;(?[_])&quot;_are_now_ended_only_by_a_&quot;\n&quot;"><a class="selflink" href="#Comment_lines_within_&quot;(?[_])&quot;_are_now_ended_only_by_a_&quot;\n&quot;">Comment
  lines within &quot;(?[&#x00A0;])&quot; are now ended only by a
  &quot;\n&quot;</a></h2>
&quot;(?[&#x00A0;])&quot; is an experimental feature, introduced in v5.18. It
  operates as if &quot;/x&quot; is always enabled. But there was a difference:
  comment lines (following a &quot;#&quot; character) were terminated by
  anything matching &quot;\R&quot; which includes all vertical whitespace, such
  as form feeds. For consistency, this is now changed to match what terminates
  comment lines outside &quot;(?[&#x00A0;])&quot;, namely a &quot;\n&quot; (even
  if escaped), which is the same as what terminates a heredoc string and
  formats.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="&quot;(?[...])&quot;_operators_now_follow_standard_Perl_precedence"><a class="selflink" href="#&quot;(?[...])&quot;_operators_now_follow_standard_Perl_precedence">&quot;(?[...])&quot;
  operators now follow standard Perl precedence</a></h2>
This experimental feature allows set operations in regular expression patterns.
  Prior to this, the intersection operator had the same precedence as the other
  binary operators. Now it has higher precedence. This could lead to different
  outcomes than existing code expects (though the documentation has always noted
  that this change might happen, recommending fully parenthesizing the
  expressions). See &quot;Extended Bracketed Character Classes&quot; in
  perlrecharclass.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Omitting_&quot;%&quot;_and_&quot;@&quot;_on_hash_and_array_names_is_no_longer_permitted"><a class="selflink" href="#Omitting_&quot;%&quot;_and_&quot;@&quot;_on_hash_and_array_names_is_no_longer_permitted">Omitting
  &quot;%&quot; and &quot;@&quot; on hash and array names is no longer
  permitted</a></h2>
Really old Perl let you omit the &quot;@&quot; on array names and the
  &quot;%&quot; on hash names in some spots. This has issued a deprecation
  warning since Perl 5.000, and is no longer permitted.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="&quot;$!&quot;_text_is_now_in_English_outside_the_scope_of_&quot;use_locale&quot;"><a class="selflink" href="#&quot;$!&quot;_text_is_now_in_English_outside_the_scope_of_&quot;use_locale&quot;">&quot;$!&quot;
  text is now in English outside the scope of &quot;use locale&quot;</a></h2>
Previously, the text, unlike almost everything else, always came out based on
  the current underlying locale of the program. (Also affected on some systems
  is &quot;$^E&quot;.) For programs that are unprepared to handle locale
  differences, this can cause garbage text to be displayed. It's better to
  display text that is translatable via some tool than garbage text which is
  much harder to figure out.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="&quot;$!&quot;_text_will_be_returned_in_UTF-8_when_appropriate"><a class="selflink" href="#&quot;$!&quot;_text_will_be_returned_in_UTF-8_when_appropriate">&quot;$!&quot;
  text will be returned in UTF-8 when appropriate</a></h2>
The stringification of $! and $^E will have the UTF-8 flag set when the text is
  actually non-ASCII UTF-8. This will enable programs that are set up to be
  locale-aware to properly output messages in the user's native language. Code
  that needs to continue the 5.20 and earlier behavior can do the
  stringification within the scopes of both &quot;use&#x00A0;bytes&quot; and
  &quot;use&#x00A0;locale&#x00A0;&quot;:messages&quot;&quot;. Within these two
  scopes, no other Perl operations will be affected by locale; only $! and $^E
  stringification. The &quot;bytes&quot; pragma causes the UTF-8 flag to not be
  set, just as in previous Perl releases. This resolves [perl #112208]
  &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=112208&gt;.

The &quot;m?PATTERN?&quot; construct, which allows matching a regex only once,
  previously had an alternative form that was written directly with a question
  mark delimiter, omitting the explicit &quot;m&quot; operator. This usage has
  produced a deprecation warning since 5.14.0. It is now a syntax error, so that
  the question mark can be available for use in new operators.

  a hash or an array as a reference are now fatal errors</a></h2>
For example, &quot;%foo-&gt;{&quot;bar&quot;}&quot; now causes a fatal
  compilation error. These have been deprecated since before v5.8, and have
  raised deprecation warnings since then.

  to the &quot;*&quot; prototype</a></h2>
The &quot;*&quot; character in a subroutine's prototype used to allow barewords
  to take precedence over most, but not all, subroutine names. It was never
  consistent and exhibited buggy behavior.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Now it has been changed, so subroutines always take precedence over barewords,
  which brings it into conformity with similarly prototyped built-in functions:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    sub splat(*) { ... }
    sub foo { ... }
    splat(foo); # now always splat(foo())
    splat(bar); # still splat('bar') as before
    close(foo); # close(foo())
    close(bar); # close('bar')

  &quot;${^ENCODING}&quot; to anything but &quot;undef&quot;</a></h2>
This variable allows Perl scripts to be written in an encoding other than ASCII
  or UTF-8. However, it affects all modules globally, leading to wrong answers
  and segmentation faults. New scripts should be written in UTF-8; old scripts
  should be converted to UTF-8, which is easily done with the piconv utility.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Use_of_non-graphic_characters_in_single-character_variable_names"><a class="selflink" href="#Use_of_non-graphic_characters_in_single-character_variable_names">Use
  of non-graphic characters in single-character variable names</a></h2>
The syntax for single-character variable names is more lenient than for longer
  variable names, allowing the one-character name to be a punctuation character
  or even invisible (a non-graphic). Perl v5.20 deprecated the ASCII-range
  controls as such a name. Now, all non-graphic characters that formerly were
  allowed are deprecated. The practical effect of this occurs only when not
  under &quot;use&#x00A0;utf8&quot;, and affects just the C1 controls (code
  points 0x80 through 0xFF), NO-BREAK SPACE, and SOFT HYPHEN.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Inlining_of_&quot;sub_()_{_$var_}&quot;_with_observable_side-effects"><a class="selflink" href="#Inlining_of_&quot;sub_()_{_$var_}&quot;_with_observable_side-effects">Inlining
  of &quot;sub () { $var }&quot; with observable side-effects</a></h2>
In many cases Perl makes &quot;sub&#x00A0;()&#x00A0;{&#x00A0;$var&#x00A0;}&quot;
  into an inlinable constant subroutine, capturing the value of $var at the time
  the &quot;sub&quot; expression is evaluated. This can break the closure
  behavior in those cases where $var is subsequently modified, since the
  subroutine won't return the changed value. (Note that this all only applies to
  anonymous subroutines with an empty prototype (&quot;sub&#x00A0;()&quot;).)
<div class="Pp"></div>
This usage is now deprecated in those cases where the variable could be modified
  elsewhere. Perl detects those cases and emits a deprecation warning. Such code
  will likely change in the future and stop producing a constant.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If your variable is only modified in the place where it is declared, then Perl
  will continue to make the sub inlinable with no warnings.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    sub make_constant {
        my $var = shift;
        return sub () { $var }; # fine
    }
    sub make_constant_deprecated {
        my $var;
        $var = shift;
        return sub () { $var }; # deprecated
    }
    sub make_constant_deprecated2 {
        my $var = shift;
        log_that_value($var); # could modify $var
        return sub () { $var }; # deprecated
    }
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
In the second example above, detecting that $var is assigned to only once is too
  hard to detect. That it happens in a spot other than the &quot;my&quot;
  declaration is enough for Perl to find it suspicious.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This deprecation warning happens only for a simple variable for the body of the
  sub. (A &quot;BEGIN&quot; block or &quot;use&quot; statement inside the sub is
  ignored, because it does not become part of the sub's body.) For more complex
  cases, such as
  &quot;sub&#x00A0;()&#x00A0;{&#x00A0;do_something()&#x00A0;if&#x00A0;0;&#x00A0;$var&#x00A0;}&quot;
  the behavior has changed such that inlining does not happen if the variable is
  modifiable elsewhere. Such cases should be rare.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Use_of_multiple_&quot;/x&quot;_regexp_modifiers"><a class="selflink" href="#Use_of_multiple_&quot;/x&quot;_regexp_modifiers">Use

It is now deprecated to say something like any of the following:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    qr/foo/xx;
    /(?xax:foo)/;
    use re qw(/amxx);
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
That is, now &quot;x&quot; should only occur once in any string of contiguous
  regular expression pattern modifiers. We do not believe there are any
  occurrences of this in all of CPAN. This is in preparation for a future Perl
  release having &quot;/xx&quot; permit white-space for readability in bracketed
  character classes (those enclosed in square brackets: &quot;[...]&quot;).

  a NO-BREAK space in a character alias for &quot;\N{...}&quot; is now
  deprecated</a></h2>
This non-graphic character is essentially indistinguishable from a regular
  space, and so should not be allowed. See &quot;CUSTOM ALIASES&quot; in
  charnames.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="A_literal_&quot;{&quot;_should_now_be_escaped_in_a_pattern"><a class="selflink" href="#A_literal_&quot;{&quot;_should_now_be_escaped_in_a_pattern">A
  literal &quot;{&quot; should now be escaped in a pattern</a></h2>
If you want a literal left curly bracket (also called a left brace) in a regular
  expression pattern, you should now escape it by either preceding it with a
  backslash (&quot;\{&quot;) or enclosing it within square brackets
  &quot;[{]&quot;, or by using &quot;\Q&quot;; otherwise a deprecation warning
  will be raised. This was first announced as forthcoming in the v5.16 release;
  it will allow future extensions to the language to happen.

    Some cases of subroutine declarations stored in the stash in shorthand form
      were being omitted.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Non-ASCII characters are now consistently escaped in strings, instead of
      some of the time. (There are still outstanding problems with regular
      expressions and identifiers that have not been fixed.)
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    When prototype sub calls are deparsed with &quot;&amp;&quot; ( <i>e.g.</i>,
      under the <b>-P</b> option), &quot;scalar&quot; is now added where
      appropriate, to force the scalar context implied by the prototype.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    &quot;require(foo())&quot;, &quot;do(foo())&quot;, &quot;goto(foo())&quot;

      outer parentheses are not optional.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Whitespace is no longer escaped in regular expressions, because it was
      getting erroneously escaped within &quot;(?x:...)&quot; sections.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    &quot;sub foo { foo() }&quot; is now deparsed with those mandatory
      parentheses.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    &quot;/@array/&quot; is now deparsed as a regular expression, and not just

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    &quot;/@{-}/&quot;, &quot;/@{+}/&quot; and $#{1} are now deparsed with the
      braces, which are mandatory in these cases.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    In deparsing feature bundles, &quot;B::Deparse&quot; was emitting &quot;no
      feature;&quot; first instead of &quot;no feature ':all';&quot;. This has
      been fixed.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    &quot;chdir FH&quot; is now deparsed without quotation marks.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    &quot;\my @a&quot; is now deparsed without parentheses. (Parenthese would
      flatten the array.)
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    &quot;system&quot; and &quot;exec&quot; followed by a block are now deparsed
      correctly. Formerly there was an erroneous &quot;do&quot; before the
      block.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    &quot;use constant QR =&gt; qr/.../flags&quot; followed by

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Deparsing &quot;BEGIN { undef &amp;foo }&quot; with the <b>-w</b> switch
      enabled started to emit 'uninitialized' warnings in Perl 5.14. This has
      been fixed.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Deparsing calls to subs with a &quot;(;+)&quot; prototype resulted in an
      infinite loop. The &quot;(;$&quot;) &quot;(_)&quot; and &quot;(;_)&quot;
      prototypes were given the wrong precedence, causing
      &quot;foo($a&lt;$b)&quot; to be deparsed without the parentheses.

    (F) &quot;defined()&quot; is not useful on arrays because it checks for an
      undefined <i>scalar</i> value. If you want to see if the array is empty,
      just use
      &quot;if&#x00A0;(@array)&#x00A0;{&#x00A0;#&#x00A0;not&#x00A0;empty&#x00A0;}&quot;

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    (F) &quot;defined()&quot; is not usually right on hashes.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Although &quot;defined&#x00A0;%hash&quot; is false on a plain not-yet-used
      hash, it becomes true in several non-obvious circumstances, including
      iterators, weak references, stash names, even remaining true after
      &quot;undef&#x00A0;%hash&quot;. These things make
      &quot;defined&#x00A0;%hash&quot; fairly useless in practice, so it now
      generates a fatal error.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If a check for non-empty is what you wanted then just put it in boolean
      context (see &quot;Scalar values&quot; in perldata):
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    if (%hash) {
       # not empty
    }
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If you had &quot;defined&#x00A0;%Foo::Bar::QUUX&quot; to check whether such
      a package variable exists then that's never really been reliable, and
      isn't a good way to enquire about the features of a package, or whether

    Warning: unable to close filehandle %s properly: %s
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    (S io) Previously, perl silently ignored any errors when doing an implicit
      close of a filehandle, <i>i.e.</i> where the reference count of the
      filehandle reached zero and the user's code hadn't already called
      &quot;close()&quot;; <i>e.g.</i>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    {
        open my $fh, '&gt;', $file  or die &quot;open: '$file': $!\n&quot;;
        print $fh, $data  or die;
    } # implicit close here
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    In a situation such as disk full, due to buffering, the error may only be
      detected during the final close, so not checking the result of the close
      is dangerous.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    So perl now warns in such situations.</dd>

    (W locale) While in a single-byte locale ( <i>i.e.</i>, a non-UTF-8 one), a
      multi-byte character was encountered. Perl considers this character to be
      the specified Unicode code point. Combining non-UTF-8 locales and Unicode
      is dangerous. Almost certainly some characters will have two different
      representations. For example, in the ISO 8859-7 (Greek) locale, the code
      point 0xC3 represents a Capital Gamma. But so also does 0x393. This will
      make string comparisons unreliable.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    You likely need to figure out how this multi-byte character got mixed up
      with your single-byte locale (or perhaps you thought you had a UTF-8
      locale, but Perl disagrees).

  <dd class="It-tag">Experimental support has been added to allow ops in the
      optree to locate their parent, if any. This is enabled by the non-default
      build option &quot;-DPERL_OP_PARENT&quot;. It is envisaged that this will
      eventually become enabled by default, so XS code which directly accesses
      the &quot;op_sibling&quot; field of ops should be updated to be
      future-proofed.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    On &quot;PERL_OP_PARENT&quot; builds, the &quot;op_sibling&quot; field has
      been renamed &quot;op_sibparent&quot; and a new flag,
      &quot;op_moresib&quot;, added. On the last op in a sibling chain,
      &quot;op_moresib&quot; is false and &quot;op_sibparent&quot; points to the
      parent (if any) rather than being &quot;NULL&quot;.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    To make existing code work transparently whether using
      &quot;PERL_OP_PARENT&quot; or not, a number of new macros and functions
      have been added that should be used, rather than directly manipulating
      &quot;op_sibling&quot;.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    For the case of just reading &quot;op_sibling&quot; to determine the next
      sibling, two new macros have been added. A simple scan through a sibling
      chain like this:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    for (; kid-&gt;op_sibling; kid = kid-&gt;op_sibling) { ... }
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    should now be written as:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    for (; OpHAS_SIBLING(kid); kid = OpSIBLING(kid)) { ... }
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    For altering optrees, a general-purpose function
      &quot;op_sibling_splice()&quot; has been added, which allows for
      manipulation of a chain of sibling ops. By analogy with the Perl function
      &quot;splice()&quot;, it allows you to cut out zero or more ops from a
      sibling chain and replace them with zero or more new ops. It transparently
      handles all the updating of sibling, parent, op_last pointers etc.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If you need to manipulate ops at a lower level, then three new macros,
      &quot;OpMORESIB_set&quot;, &quot;OpLASTSIB_set&quot; and
      &quot;OpMAYBESIB_set&quot; are intended to be a low-level portable way to
      set &quot;op_sibling&quot; / &quot;op_sibparent&quot; while also updating
      &quot;op_moresib&quot;. The first sets the sibling pointer to a new
      sibling, the second makes the op the last sibling, and the third
      conditionally does the first or second action. Note that unlike
      &quot;op_sibling_splice()&quot; these macros won't maintain consistency in
      the parent at the same time ( <i>e.g.</i> by updating &quot;op_first&quot;
      and &quot;op_last&quot; where appropriate).
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    A C-level &quot;Perl_op_parent()&quot; function and a Perl-level
      &quot;B::OP::parent()&quot; method have been added. The C function only
      exists under &quot;PERL_OP_PARENT&quot; builds (using it is build-time
      error on vanilla perls). &quot;B::OP::parent()&quot; exists always, but on
      a vanilla build it always returns &quot;NULL&quot;. Under
      &quot;PERL_OP_PARENT&quot;, they return the parent of the current op, if
      any. The variable $B::OP::does_parent allows you to determine whether
      &quot;B&quot; supports retrieving an op's parent.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    &quot;PERL_OP_PARENT&quot; was introduced in 5.21.2, but the interface was
      changed considerably in 5.21.11. If you updated your code before the
      5.21.11 changes, it may require further revision. The main changes after
      5.21.2 were:</dd>

    When an I/O error occurs, the fact that there has been an error is recorded
      in the handle. &quot;close&quot; returns false for such a handle.
      Previously, the value of $! would be untouched by &quot;close&quot;, so
      the common convention of writing
      &quot;close&#x00A0;$fh&#x00A0;or&#x00A0;die&#x00A0;$!&quot; did not work
      reliably. Now the handle records the value of $!, too, and

Brian McCauley died on May 8, 2015. He was a frequent poster to Usenet, Perl
  Monks, and other Perl forums, and made several CPAN contributions under the
  nick NOBULL, including to the Perl FAQ. He attended almost every YAPC::Europe,
  and indeed, helped organise YAPC::Europe 2006 and the QA Hackathon 2009. His
  wit and his delight in intricate systems were particularly apparent in his
  love of board games; many Perl mongers will have fond memories of playing
  Fluxx and other games with Brian. He will be missed.

The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is automatically generated
  from version control history. In particular, it does not include the names of
  the (very much appreciated) contributors who reported issues to the Perl bug
  tracker.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Many of the changes included in this version originated in the CPAN modules
  included in Perl's core. We're grateful to the entire CPAN community for
  helping Perl to flourish.

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Reporting_Bugs"><a class="selflink" href="#Reporting_Bugs">Reporting
  Bugs</a></h1>
If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently
  posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at
  &lt;https://rt.perl.org/&gt;. There may also be information at
  &lt;http://www.perl.org/&gt;, the Perl Home Page.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug program
  included with your release. Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
  sufficient test case. Your bug report, along with the output of &quot;perl
  -V&quot;, will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl
  porting team.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it
  inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send it
  to perl5-security-report@perl.org. This points to a closed subscription
  unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core committers, who will be
  able to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help
  co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all
  platforms on which Perl is supported. Please only use this address for
  security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently distributed on
  CPAN.
