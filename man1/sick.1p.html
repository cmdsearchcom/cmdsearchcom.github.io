<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
sick - Compiler for CLC-INTERCAL</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
sick [options] files...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
sick is the main development environment for CLC-INTERCAL.
If files are specified, these will be compiled using the
options in effect at the point where they appear on the <br>
command line, and they are compiled to objects (if they are
not already object). After all the options have been
processed, the program enters interactive mode, unless
otherwise <br>
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The program will be compiled
using a compiler selected using command line options; if
nothing is selected, the compiler depends on the file
suffix:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CLC-INTERCAL program source <br>
These files must have suffix .i or .clci. These will be
prefixed, by default, with the compiler object sick.io.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CLC-INTERCAL compiler source
<br>
These files must have suffix .iacc. These will be prefixed,
by default, with the compiler object iacc.io and produce a
compiler object (which can be executed as a program, <br>
but will do nothing - it&rsquo;s only useful as a preload
before compiling from source).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C-INTERCAL program source <br>
These have suffix .ci and will be prefixed with the compiler
object ick.io.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CLC-INTERCAL assembler source
<br>
These have suffix .iasm and will be prefixed with the
compiler object asm.io.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Traditional INTERCAL program
source <br>
These will have suffix .1972 and will be prefixed with the
compiler object 1972.io</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Compiler extensions <br>
Suffixes .i, .ci, .clci and .iasm can contain a list of
letters and numbers between the spot (.) and the rest of the
suffix; these select compiler extensions to be added.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Base Numbers between 2 and 7
change the default base by loading compiler objects 2.io to
7.io.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bitwise Divide <br>
Letter d in the suffix adds the compiler object
bitwise-divide.io, which changes the normal unary divide
operation to use bitwise, rather than arithmetic, shifts. It
<br>
can be used with sick or iasm but not with ick.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COME FROM gerund <br>
Letter g in the suffix adds the compiler object
come-from-gerund.io, which enables the COME FROM gerund
statements; since ick does not parse such statements, this
<br>
letter can only be used with sick or iasm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Computed labels <br>
Letter l in the suffix adds the compiler object
computed-labels.io, which adds grammar rules to parse
computed statement labels; this can be used only with
sick.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NEXT Letter n in the suffix adds
the compiler object next.io, which enables the NEXT
statement in sick; since ick enables this by default, this
letter can only be used <br>
with sick.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INTERcal NETworking <br>
Letter r in the suffix adds the compiler object internet.io,
which adds syntax for the STEAL, SMUGGLE and CASE
statements; it can be used with ick or sick.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">System call <br>
Letter s in the suffix adds the compiler object syscall.io,
which hides a &quot;PLEASE NEXT FROM (666)&quot; in a dark
corner of your operating system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Threaded program <br>
Letter t in the suffix selects threaded mode by loading
compiler object thick.io. This also changes the default
compiler to ick if the suffix is .i: to use sick one <br>
would use .tclci.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Wimp mode <br>
Letter w in the suffix adds the compiler object wimp.io,
which causes the program to start in wimp mode when it is
executed. An equivalent result can be obtained by <br>
passing the --wimp option to the executable program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The actual list of suffixes
recognised can be changed by editing the file system,sickrc
or .sickrc. See the option --rcfile for a discussion on how
and where sick finds these <br>
files, and sickrc for a description of the file format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a preload file is specified
on the command line, the defaults derived from the suffix
are not used. It is also possible to use default preloads
from a different file suffix by <br>
explicitely saying -suffix=S - in this case, the compiler
acts as if the file had name name.S</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition, compiler objects
are always recognised, with whatever suffix. These bypass
the first compiler pass and jump directly to the runtime
(just-too-late) compiler. <br>
However, if the optimiser has been selected when these
objects were compiled, and there are no postprocessor
statements, the just-too-late compiler will be automatically
replaced <br>
by a more traditional &quot;compile-time&quot; compiler. If
this is confusing, wait until you see the rest.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a file is specified without
suffix, and there is a compiler object in the include path
with the same name and suffix .io, the suffix is
automatically added, whether you wanted <br>
it or now.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As soon as each program is
written into sick, a pre-compiler will produce an internal
compiler object. If sick enters interactive mode, these
objects will be available in memory <br>
for single-stepping, running, or just ignoring completely
and getting on with the real work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If sick loads all the required
programs and objects successfully, but does not enter
interactive mode, any program source is read back out to
disk in object format, using the <br>
same file name with the suffix replaced by .io if no output
file is specified. If a backend is specified in the command
line before a program is loaded, sick will produce an <br>
executable via that backend instead of an object.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The compiler accepts several
options, some of which are documented here. Options and
files can be mixed in any order, each file is loaded and
compiled using whatever options <br>
precedes it on the command line. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sick --verbose --optimise
prog1.i --quiet prog2.i --batch</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will tell you everything about
compiling prog1.i but not about prog2.i. Both programs will
be optimised. On the other hand:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sick --optimise prog1.i
--nooptimise prog2.i --batch</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will optimise prog1.i but not
prog2.i.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All options can be
&quot;undone&quot; (sometimes it&rsquo;s even clear how)
except --include which applies to all objects loaded after
it, and --rcfile which applies to all objects, even the <br>
ones loaded before it (just to be different).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">User Interface Options <br>
-X / --graphic <br>
Enters X-based graphical user interface. Requires Perl-GTK.
This is the default if Perl-GTK is installed, the
environment variable $DISPLAY is set and the opening of the
X <br>
display succeeds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c / --curses <br>
Enters full screen, curses-based interface. This is the
default if the X based interface cannot be started, the
environment variable $TERM is set and the terminal name is
<br>
known.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--line <br>
Enters the line-mode user interface. This is the default if
the X based and the curses based interfaces do not work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--batch <br>
Avoids entering interactive mode. This is the default if the
standard input and output are not connected to a terminal
and the X based interface cannot be started.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-itype / --interface=type <br>
Selects the user interface type. Currently, only X, Curses,
Line and None are defined, but more can be installed as
compiler plug-ins. If the interface selected is None, sick
<br>
will work in batch mode. In addition, an empty string will
reinstate the default behaviour.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Source Character Set Options
<br>
-a / --ascii <br>
Assumes that program source is in ASCII.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b / --baudot <br>
Assumes that program source is in Baudot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e / --ebcdic <br>
Assumes that program source is in EBCDIC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h / --hollerith <br>
Assumes that program source is in Hollerith.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g / --guess <br>
Does not make assumptions about the source character set. If
the character set cannot be guessed, will produce an error.
This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--charset=name <br>
Assumes that program source is in the given character sets.
Valid values are currently ASCII, Baudot, EBCDIC, Hollerith;
an empty name is equivalent to specifying option <br>
--guess).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Code Generation Options <br>
-O / --optimise <br>
Invokes the optimiser. This is a letter o, not a zero. This
will cause the extra object optimise.io to be prefixed after
the last compiler and before the real program. The <br>
program is then executed: when the optimiser takes control,
it will force compilation of the rest of the program
(thereby executing the compiler at compile-time, instead of
<br>
runtime as it normally does), and the resulting object is
checkpointed, so the next time it will automatically skip
the initialisation and compilation stages. In addition, <br>
the &quot;optimise&quot; register is set, instructing the
compiler to invoke the optimiser when it runs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you specify -O and -poptimise
(see below), you are asking for trouble, so don&rsquo;t do
that.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--nooptimise <br>
Disables automatic preloading and execution of
optimise.io.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-oname / --output=name <br>
Selects a name for the output file. Some character sequences
are recognised inside name: %p will be replaced by the
source program&rsquo;s basename; %s will be replaced by the
<br>
appropriate suffix for the selected backend, %o will provide
the original file name specified on the command line,
without suffix (this can differ from %s because %s can be
<br>
prefixed with a directory from the search path) and %% will
produce a single %.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is %p.%s, which
produces the object name described at the beginning of this
document. A suffix is not automatically added if the output
name does not contain %s; <br>
this might be useful in ocnjunction with the Perl backend to
produce a file without a suffix, for example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sick --output=%p --backend=Perl
sourcefile.i</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will compile sourcefile.i and
produce perl script sourcefile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the output file is specified
as an empty string, the code generation step will never be
done.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nname / --name=name <br>
Sets the program&rsquo;s name, if the code generator
requires it (currently, no backends use a name, but some of
the planned ones will). The default is %o. The same
%-escapes as <br>
defined for the output file name are defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-lname / --backend=name <br>
Selects a different compiler back end. The default is
Object, which produces a compiler object (suffix .io). The
distribution also includes a Perl backend, which produces an
<br>
executable Perl program (suffix .pl). In addition, the
pseudo backend Run will run the program instead of writing
any object. In this case, the output file name is ignored.
<br>
Note that the program will only run if the compiler is in
batch mode. Other back ends can be provided as compiler plug
ins. The distribution also contains a ListObject <br>
backend, which does not produce executables but object
listings. A future version might allow to
&quot;compile&quot; the output of the ListObject back end,
but this is currently <br>
impossible because not all the internal state of the object
is provided, only the part which is likely to be useful to a
human reader.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--bug=number <br>
Selects a different probability for the compiler bug. The
compiler bug is implemented by initialising the
compiler&rsquo;s state with the required probability: when a
statement is <br>
compiled (usually at runtime), a &quot;BUG&quot; instruction
is emitted with the required probability. The default is
1%.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ubug=number <br>
Selects a probability for the unexplainable compiler bug.
This is the compiler bug which occurs when the probability
of a (explainable) compiler bug is zero. Only wimps <br>
would use this option. The default is 0.01%.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pname / --preload=name <br>
Selects a compiler object to prefix to the program. If this
option is specified, the compiler won&rsquo;t automatically
prefix objects as suggested by the suffix. The program
&rsquo;oo, <br>
ick&rsquo; included in previous version of CLC-INTERCAL used
option -p to select a parser. Since the main use of preloads
is to select an alternative (runtime) compiler, it is felt
<br>
that it is appropriate to keep the same letter for this
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The file name specified does not
include the suffix .io, which is always added. The file must
be a compiler object, not source code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The special object optimise
should always loaded via -O. Using -poptimise will not
necessarily put the object in the correct place, and will
not instruct the precompiler to <br>
do whatever magic it needs to do to bootstrap the
optimiser.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To completely disable preloading
(this is only done when compiling the optimiser, which is
used to compile itself) use an empty string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--nopreload <br>
Resets the default behaviour of selecting preloads based on
suffixes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--suffix=suffix <br>
Specifies a suffix to use when selecting preloads. If this
option is not specified, the suffix is taken from the file
name to be compiled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Ipath / --include=path <br>
Adds a directory before the standard search path for
compiler objects and source code. If a file is accessible
from the current directory, it is never searched in any
include <br>
path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option is repeated, the
given paths will be searched in the order given, followed by
the standard paths.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Misc Options <br>
-rname / --rcfile=name <br>
Executes commands from file name before entering interactive
mode. This option can be repeated, to execute more than one
file. If it is not specified, the standard library, <br>
the current directory, and the current user&rsquo;s home
directory are searched for files with name system.sickrc or
.sickrc, which are then executed. The order for this search
is: <br>
specified library (--include), system library, home
directory, current directory. This is different from the
search order used when looking for objects or source code.
If a <br>
directory contains both .sickrc and system.sickrc, the
system.sickrc is executed first, followed by .sickrc. Also
note that if the current directory or the home directory
<br>
appear in the search path and contain one of these files,
they will be executed twice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If filenames are explicitely
specified, they must be fully qualified: the search path is
not used to find them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--nouserrc <br>
Prevents loading a user rcfile (.sickrc); also limits
loading of system.sickrc to the first one found. This option
is normally only used during installation, to prevent <br>
interference from previous versions of CLC-INTERCAL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v / --verbose <br>
Tells everything it&rsquo;s doing (on Standard Error).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--stdverb=file <br>
Sends verbose output to file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--trace <br>
Enables tracing; if compiling from source, the compiler is
also traced; to trace a program, compile it to an object and
then run it with --trace.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--stdtrace=file <br>
Enables tracing and selects an output file for the trace
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--notrace <br>
Disables tracing; preloading trace.io has priority over this
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q / --quiet <br>
Stop talking to Standard Error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--times <br>
Prints a summary of the time take for each major action.
This setting is independent of --verbose.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--notimes <br>
Does not print execution times: this is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--rclist <br>
Prints the names of all rcfiles found. It prevents starting
interactive mode. For example, the following command (which
should work with any Unix shell) opens all the system <br>
and user sickrc files in your favourite editor:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sh -c
&rsquo;&quot;${EDITOR:-vi}&quot; &quot;&lsquo;sick
--rclist&lsquo;&quot;&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This can be useful to update the
defaults.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
There are more options than ls(1). This is construed to be a
feature.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
The INTERCAL on-line documentation, by entering sick&rsquo;s
interactive mode and finding the &quot;help&quot; menu (X),
key (Curses) or command (Line).</p>
