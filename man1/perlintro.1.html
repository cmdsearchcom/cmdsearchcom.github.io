<p>PERLINTRO(1) Perl Programmers Reference Guide
PERLINTRO(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
perlintro -- a brief introduction and overview of Perl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This document is intended to give you a quick overview of
the Perl programming language, along with pointers to
further documentation. It is intended as a
&quot;bootstrap&quot; guide for <br>
those who are new to the language, and provides just enough
information for you to be able to read other peoples&rsquo;
Perl and understand roughly what it&rsquo;s doing, or write
your own <br>
simple scripts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This introductory document does
not aim to be complete. It does not even aim to be entirely
accurate. In some cases perfection has been sacrificed in
the goal of getting the <br>
general idea across. You are strongly advised to follow this
introduction with more information from the full Perl
manual, the table of contents to which can be found in <br>
perltoc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Throughout this document
you&rsquo;ll see references to other parts of the Perl
documentation. You can read that documentation using the
&quot;perldoc&quot; command or whatever method you&rsquo;re
<br>
using to read this document.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Throughout Perl&rsquo;s
documentation, you&rsquo;ll find numerous examples intended
to help explain the discussed features. Please keep in mind
that many of them are code fragments rather <br>
than complete programs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These examples often reflect the
style and preference of the author of that piece of the
documentation, and may be briefer than a corresponding line
of code in a real program. <br>
Except where otherwise noted, you should assume that
&quot;use strict&quot; and &quot;use warnings&quot;
statements appear earlier in the &quot;program&quot;, and
that any variables used have already been <br>
declared, even if those declarations have been omitted to
make the example easier to read.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Do note that the examples have
been written by many different authors over a period of
several decades. Styles and techniques will therefore
differ, although some effort has <br>
been made to not vary styles too widely in the same
sections. Do not consider one style to be better than others
- &quot;There&rsquo;s More Than One Way To Do It&quot; is
one of Perl&rsquo;s mottos. <br>
After all, in your journey as a programmer, you are likely
to encounter different styles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">What is Perl? <br>
Perl is a general-purpose programming language originally
developed for text manipulation and now used for a wide
range of tasks including system administration, web
development, <br>
network programming, GUI development, and more.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The language is intended to be
practical (easy to use, efficient, complete) rather than
beautiful (tiny, elegant, minimal). Its major features are
that it&rsquo;s easy to use, <br>
supports both procedural and object-oriented (OO)
programming, has powerful built-in support for text
processing, and has one of the world&rsquo;s most impressive
collections of third- <br>
party modules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Different definitions of Perl
are given in perl, perlfaq1 and no doubt other places. From
this we can determine that Perl is different things to
different people, but that lots <br>
of people think it&rsquo;s at least worth writing about.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Running Perl programs <br>
To run a Perl program from the Unix command line:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perl progname.pl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alternatively, put this as the
first line of your script:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#!/usr/bin/env perl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">... and run the script as
&quot;/path/to/script.pl&quot;. Of course, it&rsquo;ll need
to be executable first, so &quot;chmod 755 script.pl&quot;
(under Unix).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(This start line assumes you
have the env program. You can also put directly the path to
your perl executable, like in
&quot;#!/usr/bin/perl&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For more information, including
instructions for other platforms such as Windows and Mac OS,
read perlrun.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Safety net <br>
Perl by default is very forgiving. In order to make it more
robust it is recommended to start every program with the
following lines:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#!/usr/bin/perl <br>
use strict; <br>
use warnings;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The two additional lines request
from perl to catch various common problems in your code.
They check different things so you need both. A potential
problem caught by &quot;use <br>
strict;&quot; will cause your code to stop immediately when
it is encountered, while &quot;use warnings;&quot; will
merely give a warning (like the command-line switch -w) and
let your code <br>
run. To read more about them check their respective manual
pages at strict and warnings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Basic syntax overview <br>
A Perl script or program consists of one or more statements.
These statements are simply written in the script in a
straightforward fashion. There is no need to have a
&quot;main()&quot; <br>
function or anything of that kind.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl statements end in a
semi-colon:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print &quot;Hello,
world&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Comments start with a hash
symbol and run to the end of the line</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># This is a comment</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Whitespace is irrelevant:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print <br>
&quot;Hello, world&quot; <br>
;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">... except inside quoted
strings:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># this would print with a
linebreak in the middle <br>
print &quot;Hello <br>
world&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Double quotes or single quotes
may be used around literal strings:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print &quot;Hello, world&quot;;
<br>
print &rsquo;Hello, world&rsquo;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, only double quotes
&quot;interpolate&quot; variables and special characters
such as newlines (&quot;0):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print &quot;Hello, $name0; #
works fine <br>
print &rsquo;Hello, $name0; # prints $nameliterally</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Numbers don&rsquo;t need quotes
around them:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print 42;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can use parentheses for
functions&rsquo; arguments or omit them according to your
personal taste. They are only required occasionally to
clarify issues of precedence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print(&quot;Hello, world0); <br>
print &quot;Hello, world0;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">More detailed information about
Perl syntax can be found in perlsyn.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl variable types <br>
Perl has three main variable types: scalars, arrays, and
hashes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Scalars <br>
A scalar represents a single value:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">my $animal = &quot;camel&quot;;
<br>
my $answer = 42;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Scalar values can be strings,
integers or floating point numbers, and Perl will
automatically convert between them as required. There is no
need to pre-declare your variable <br>
types, but you have to declare them using the &quot;my&quot;
keyword the first time you use them. (This is one of the
requirements of &quot;use strict;&quot;.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Scalar values can be used in
various ways:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print $animal; <br>
print &quot;The animal is $animal0; <br>
print &quot;The square of $answer is &quot;, $answer *
$answer, &quot;0;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are a number of
&quot;magic&quot; scalars with names that look like
punctuation or line noise. These special variables are used
for all kinds of purposes, and are documented in <br>
perlvar. The only one you need to know about for now is $_
which is the &quot;default variable&quot;. It&rsquo;s used
as the default argument to a number of functions in Perl,
and it&rsquo;s set <br>
implicitly by certain looping constructs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print; # prints contents of $_
by default</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Arrays <br>
An array represents a list of values:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">my @animals =
(&quot;camel&quot;, &quot;llama&quot;, &quot;owl&quot;);
<br>
my @numbers = (23, 42, 69); <br>
my @mixed = (&quot;camel&quot;, 42, 1.23);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Arrays are zero-indexed.
Here&rsquo;s how you get at elements in an array:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print $animals[0]; # prints
&quot;camel&quot; <br>
print $animals[1]; # prints &quot;llama&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The special variable $#array
tells you the index of the last element of an array:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print $mixed[$#mixed]; # last
element, prints 1.23</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You might be tempted to use
&quot;$#array + 1&quot; to tell you how many items there are
in an array. Don&rsquo;t bother. As it happens, using @array
where Perl expects to find a scalar <br>
value (&quot;in scalar context&quot;) will give you the
number of elements in the array:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if (@animals &lt; 5) { ... }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The elements we&rsquo;re getting
from the array start with a &quot;$&quot; because
we&rsquo;re getting just a single value out of the array;
you ask for a scalar, you get a scalar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To get multiple values from an
array:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@animals[0,1]; # gives
(&quot;camel&quot;, &quot;llama&quot;); <br>
@animals[0..2]; # gives (&quot;camel&quot;,
&quot;llama&quot;, &quot;owl&quot;); <br>
@animals[1..$#animals]; # gives all except the first
element</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is called an &quot;array
slice&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can do various useful things
to lists:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">my @sorted = sort @animals; <br>
my @backwards = reverse @numbers;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are a couple of special
arrays too, such as @ARGV (the command line arguments to
your script) and @_ (the arguments passed to a subroutine).
These are documented in <br>
perlvar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hashes <br>
A hash represents a set of key/value pairs:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">my %fruit_color =
(&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;red&quot;, &quot;banana&quot;,
&quot;yellow&quot;);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can use whitespace and the
&quot;=&gt;&quot; operator to lay them out more nicely:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">my %fruit_color = ( <br>
apple =&gt; &quot;red&quot;, <br>
banana =&gt; &quot;yellow&quot;, <br>
);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To get at hash elements:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">$fruit_color{&quot;apple&quot;};
# gives &quot;red&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can get at lists of keys and
values with &quot;keys()&quot; and &quot;values()&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">my @fruits = keys %fruit_colors;
<br>
my @colors = values %fruit_colors;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hashes have no particular
internal order, though you can sort the keys and loop
through them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Just like special scalars and
arrays, there are also special hashes. The most well known
of these is %ENV which contains environment variables. Read
all about it (and other <br>
special variables) in perlvar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Scalars, arrays and hashes are
documented more fully in perldata.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">More complex data types can be
constructed using references, which allow you to build lists
and hashes within lists and hashes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A reference is a scalar value
and can refer to any other Perl data type. So by storing a
reference as the value of an array or hash element, you can
easily create lists and <br>
hashes within lists and hashes. The following example shows
a 2 level hash of hash structure using anonymous hash
references.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">my $variables = { <br>
scalar =&gt; { <br>
description =&gt; &quot;single item&quot;, <br>
sigil =&gt; &rsquo;$&rsquo;, <br>
}, <br>
array =&gt; { <br>
description =&gt; &quot;ordered list of items&quot;, <br>
sigil =&gt; &rsquo;@&rsquo;, <br>
}, <br>
hash =&gt; { <br>
description =&gt; &quot;key/value pairs&quot;, <br>
sigil =&gt; &rsquo;%&rsquo;, <br>
}, <br>
};</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print &quot;Scalars begin with a
$variables-&gt;{&rsquo;scalar&rsquo;}-&gt;{&rsquo;sigil&rsquo;}0;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Exhaustive information on the
topic of references can be found in perlreftut, perllol,
perlref and perldsc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Variable scoping <br>
Throughout the previous section all the examples have used
the syntax:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">my $var = &quot;value&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;my&quot; is actually
not required; you could just use:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$var = &quot;value&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, the above usage will
create global variables throughout your program, which is
bad programming practice. &quot;my&quot; creates lexically
scoped variables instead. The variables <br>
are scoped to the block (i.e. a bunch of statements
surrounded by curly-braces) in which they are defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">my $x = &quot;foo&quot;; <br>
my $some_condition = 1; <br>
if ($some_condition) { <br>
my $y = &quot;bar&quot;; <br>
print $x; # prints &quot;foo&quot; <br>
print $y; # prints &quot;bar&quot; <br>
} <br>
print $x; # prints &quot;foo&quot; <br>
print $y; # prints nothing; $y has fallen out of scope</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using &quot;my&quot; in
combination with a &quot;use strict;&quot; at the top of
your Perl scripts means that the interpreter will pick up
certain common programming errors. For instance, in the <br>
example above, the final &quot;print $y&quot; would cause a
compile-time error and prevent you from running the program.
Using &quot;strict&quot; is highly recommended.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Conditional and looping
constructs <br>
Perl has most of the usual conditional and looping
constructs. As of Perl 5.10, it even has a case/switch
statement (spelled &quot;given&quot;/&quot;when&quot;). See
&quot;Switch Statements&quot; in perlsyn <br>
for more details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The conditions can be any Perl
expression. See the list of operators in the next section
for information on comparison and boolean logic operators,
which are commonly used in <br>
conditional statements.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if <br>
if ( condition ) { <br>
... <br>
} elsif ( other condition ) { <br>
... <br>
} else { <br>
... <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There&rsquo;s also a negated
version of it:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unless ( condition ) { <br>
... <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is provided as a more
readable version of &quot;if (!condition)&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the braces are
required in Perl, even if you&rsquo;ve only got one line in
the block. However, there is a clever way of making your
one-line conditional blocks more <br>
English like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># the traditional way <br>
if ($zippy) { <br>
print &quot;Yow!&quot;; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># the Perlish post-condition way
<br>
print &quot;Yow!&quot; if $zippy; <br>
print &quot;We have no bananas&quot; unless $bananas;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">while <br>
while ( condition ) { <br>
... <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There&rsquo;s also a negated
version, for the same reason we have &quot;unless&quot;:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">until ( condition ) { <br>
... <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also use
&quot;while&quot; in a post-condition:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print &quot;LA LA LA0 while 1; #
loops forever</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">for Exactly like C:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">for ($i = 0; $i &lt;= $max;
$i++) { <br>
... <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The C style for loop is rarely
needed in Perl since Perl provides the more friendly list
scanning &quot;foreach&quot; loop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">foreach <br>
foreach (@array) { <br>
print &quot;This element is $_0; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print $list[$_] foreach 0 ..
$max;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># you don&rsquo;t have to use
the default $_ either... <br>
foreach my $key (keys %hash) { <br>
print &quot;The value of $key is $hash{$key}0; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;foreach&quot; keyword
is actually a synonym for the &quot;for&quot; keyword. See
&quot;&quot;Foreach Loops&quot; in perlsyn&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For more detail on looping
constructs (and some that weren&rsquo;t mentioned in this
overview) see perlsyn.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Builtin operators and functions
<br>
Perl comes with a wide selection of builtin functions. Some
of the ones we&rsquo;ve already seen include
&quot;print&quot;, &quot;sort&quot; and &quot;reverse&quot;.
A list of them is given at the start of <br>
perlfunc and you can easily read about any given function by
using &quot;perldoc -f functionname&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl operators are documented in
full in perlop, but here are a few of the most common
ones:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Arithmetic <br>
+ addition <br>
- subtraction <br>
* multiplication <br>
/ division</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Numeric comparison <br>
== equality <br>
!= inequality <br>
&lt; less than <br>
&gt; greater than <br>
&lt;= less than or equal <br>
&gt;= greater than or equal</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">String comparison <br>
eq equality <br>
ne inequality <br>
lt less than <br>
gt greater than <br>
le less than or equal <br>
ge greater than or equal</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(Why do we have separate numeric
and string comparisons? Because we don&rsquo;t have special
variable types, and Perl needs to know whether to sort
numerically (where 99 is less <br>
than 100) or alphabetically (where 100 comes before 99).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Boolean logic <br>
&amp;&amp; and <br>
|| or <br>
! not</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(&quot;and&quot;, &quot;or&quot;
and &quot;not&quot; aren&rsquo;t just in the above table as
descriptions of the operators. They&rsquo;re also supported
as operators in their own right. They&rsquo;re more readable
than <br>
the C-style operators, but have different precedence to
&quot;&amp;&amp;&quot; and friends. Check perlop for more
detail.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Miscellaneous <br>
= assignment <br>
. string concatenation <br>
x string multiplication <br>
.. range operator (creates a list of numbers)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Many operators can be combined
with a &quot;=&quot; as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$a += 1; # same as $a = $a + 1
<br>
$a -= 1; # same as $a = $a - 1 <br>
$a .= &quot;0; # same as $a = $a . &quot;0;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Files and I/O <br>
You can open a file for input or output using the
&quot;open()&quot; function. It&rsquo;s documented in
extravagant detail in perlfunc and perlopentut, but in
short:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">open(my $in, &quot;&lt;&quot;,
&quot;input.txt&quot;) or die &quot;Can&rsquo;t open
input.txt: $!&quot;; <br>
open(my $out, &quot;&gt;&quot;, &quot;output.txt&quot;) or
die &quot;Can&rsquo;t open output.txt: $!&quot;; <br>
open(my $log, &quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;, &quot;my.log&quot;) or
die &quot;Can&rsquo;t open my.log: $!&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can read from an open
filehandle using the &quot;&lt;&gt;&quot; operator. In
scalar context it reads a single line from the filehandle,
and in list context it reads the whole file in, <br>
assigning each line to an element of the list:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">my $line = &lt;$in&gt;; <br>
my @lines = &lt;$in&gt;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Reading in the whole file at one
time is called slurping. It can be useful but it may be a
memory hog. Most text file processing can be done a line at
a time with Perl&rsquo;s <br>
looping constructs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;&lt;&gt;&quot;
operator is most often seen in a &quot;while&quot; loop:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">while (&lt;$in&gt;) { # assigns
each line in turn to $_ <br>
print &quot;Just read in this line: $_&quot;; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">We&rsquo;ve already seen how to
print to standard output using &quot;print()&quot;. However,
&quot;print()&quot; can also take an optional first argument
specifying which filehandle to print to:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print STDERR &quot;This is your
final warning.0; <br>
print $out $record; <br>
print $log $logmessage;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When you&rsquo;re done with your
filehandles, you should &quot;close()&quot; them (though to
be honest, Perl will clean up after you if you forget):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">close $in or die &quot;$in:
$!&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Regular expressions <br>
Perl&rsquo;s regular expression support is both broad and
deep, and is the subject of lengthy documentation in
perlrequick, perlretut, and elsewhere. However, in
short:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Simple matching <br>
if (/foo/) { ... } # true if $_ contains &quot;foo&quot;
<br>
if ($a =~ /foo/) { ... } # true if $a contains
&quot;foo&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;//&quot; matching
operator is documented in perlop. It operates on $_ by
default, or can be bound to another variable using the
&quot;=~&quot; binding operator (also documented in <br>
perlop).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Simple substitution <br>
s/foo/bar/; # replaces foo with bar in $_ <br>
$a =~ s/foo/bar/; # replaces foo with bar in $a <br>
$a =~ s/foo/bar/g; # replaces ALL INSTANCES of foo with bar
in $a</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;s///&quot;
substitution operator is documented in perlop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">More complex regular expressions
<br>
You don&rsquo;t just have to match on fixed strings. In
fact, you can match on just about anything you could dream
of by using more complex regular expressions. These are <br>
documented at great length in perlre, but for the meantime,
here&rsquo;s a quick cheat sheet:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">. a single character <br>
a whitespace character (space, tab, newline, ...) <br>
non-whitespace character <br>
a digit (0-9) <br>
a non-digit <br>
0 a word character (a-z, A-Z, 0-9, _) <br>
W a non-word character <br>
[aeiou] matches a single character in the given set <br>
[^aeiou] matches a single character outside the given set
<br>
(foo|bar|baz) matches any of the alternatives specified</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^ start of string <br>
$ end of string</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Quantifiers can be used to
specify how many of the previous thing you want to match on,
where &quot;thing&quot; means either a literal character,
one of the metacharacters listed <br>
above, or a group of characters or metacharacters in
parentheses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* zero or more of the previous
thing <br>
+ one or more of the previous thing <br>
? zero or one of the previous thing <br>
{3} matches exactly 3 of the previous thing <br>
{3,6} matches between 3 and 6 of the previous thing <br>
{3,} matches 3 or more of the previous thing</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some brief examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/^+/ string starts with one or
more digits <br>
/^$/ nothing in the string (start and end are adjacent) <br>
/({3}/ a three digits, each followed by a whitespace <br>
character (eg &quot;3 4 5 &quot;) <br>
/(a.)+/ matches a string in which every odd-numbered letter
<br>
is a (eg &quot;abacadaf&quot;)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># This loop reads from STDIN,
and prints non-blank lines: <br>
while (&lt;&gt;) { <br>
next if /^$/; <br>
print; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Parentheses for capturing <br>
As well as grouping, parentheses serve a second purpose.
They can be used to capture the results of parts of the
regexp match for later use. The results end up in $1, $2
<br>
and so on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># a cheap and nasty way to break
an email address up into parts</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if ($email =~ /([^@]+)@(.+)/) {
<br>
print &quot;Username is $10; <br>
print &quot;Hostname is $20; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other regexp features <br>
Perl regexps also support backreferences, lookaheads, and
all kinds of other complex details. Read all about them in
perlrequick, perlretut, and perlre.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Writing subroutines <br>
Writing subroutines is easy:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sub logger { <br>
my $logmessage = shift; <br>
open my $logfile, &quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;, &quot;my.log&quot;
or die &quot;Could not open my.log: $!&quot;; <br>
print $logfile $logmessage; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Now we can use the subroutine
just as any other built-in function:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">logger(&quot;We have a logger
subroutine!&quot;);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">What&rsquo;s that
&quot;shift&quot;? Well, the arguments to a subroutine are
available to us as a special array called @_ (see perlvar
for more on that). The default argument to the
&quot;shift&quot; <br>
function just happens to be @_. So &quot;my $logmessage =
shift;&quot; shifts the first item off the list of arguments
and assigns it to $logmessage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">We can manipulate @_ in other
ways too:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">my ($logmessage, $priority) =
@_; # common <br>
my $logmessage = $_[0]; # uncommon, and ugly</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Subroutines can also return
values:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sub square { <br>
my $num = shift; <br>
my $result = $num * $num; <br>
return $result; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Then use it like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$sq = square(8);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For more information on writing
subroutines, see perlsub.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OO Perl <br>
OO Perl is relatively simple and is implemented using
references which know what sort of object they are based on
Perl&rsquo;s concept of packages. However, OO Perl is
largely beyond <br>
the scope of this document. Read perlootut and perlobj.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As a beginning Perl programmer,
your most common use of OO Perl will be in using third-party
modules, which are documented below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using Perl modules <br>
Perl modules provide a range of features to help you avoid
reinventing the wheel, and can be downloaded from CPAN (
http://www.cpan.org/ ). A number of popular modules are <br>
included with the Perl distribution itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Categories of modules range from
text manipulation to network protocols to database
integration to graphics. A categorized list of modules is
also available from CPAN.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To learn how to install modules
you download from CPAN, read perlmodinstall.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To learn how to use a particular
module, use &quot;perldoc Module::Name&quot;. Typically you
will want to &quot;use Module::Name&quot;, which will then
give you access to exported functions or an <br>
OO interface to the module.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perlfaq contains questions and
answers related to many common tasks, and often provides
suggestions for good CPAN modules to use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perlmod describes Perl modules
in general. perlmodlib lists the modules which came with
your Perl installation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you feel the urge to write
Perl modules, perlnewmod will give you good advice.</p>
