<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="NAME"><a class="selflink" href="#NAME">NAME</a></h1>
perlintro -- a brief introduction and overview of Perl
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
This document is intended to give you a quick overview of the Perl programming
  language, along with pointers to further documentation. It is intended as a
  &quot;bootstrap&quot; guide for those who are new to the language, and
  provides just enough information for you to be able to read other peoples'
  Perl and understand roughly what it's doing, or write your own simple scripts.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This introductory document does not aim to be complete. It does not even aim to
  be entirely accurate. In some cases perfection has been sacrificed in the goal
  of getting the general idea across. You are <i>strongly</i> advised to follow
  this introduction with more information from the full Perl manual, the table
  of contents to which can be found in perltoc.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Throughout this document you'll see references to other parts of the Perl
  documentation. You can read that documentation using the &quot;perldoc&quot;
  command or whatever method you're using to read this document.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Throughout Perl's documentation, you'll find numerous examples intended to help
  explain the discussed features. Please keep in mind that many of them are code
  fragments rather than complete programs.
<div class="Pp"></div>
These examples often reflect the style and preference of the author of that
  piece of the documentation, and may be briefer than a corresponding line of
  code in a real program. Except where otherwise noted, you should assume that
  &quot;use strict&quot; and &quot;use warnings&quot; statements appear earlier
  in the &quot;program&quot;, and that any variables used have already been
  declared, even if those declarations have been omitted to make the example
  easier to read.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Do note that the examples have been written by many different authors over a
  period of several decades. Styles and techniques will therefore differ,
  although some effort has been made to not vary styles too widely in the same
  sections. Do not consider one style to be better than others - &quot;There's
  More Than One Way To Do It&quot; is one of Perl's mottos. After all, in your
  journey as a programmer, you are likely to encounter different styles.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="What_is_Perl?"><a class="selflink" href="#What_is_Perl?">What
  is Perl?</a></h2>
Perl is a general-purpose programming language originally developed for text
  manipulation and now used for a wide range of tasks including system
  administration, web development, network programming, GUI development, and
  more.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The language is intended to be practical (easy to use, efficient, complete)
  rather than beautiful (tiny, elegant, minimal). Its major features are that
  it's easy to use, supports both procedural and object-oriented (OO)
  programming, has powerful built-in support for text processing, and has one of
  the world's most impressive collections of third-party modules.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Different definitions of Perl are given in perl, perlfaq1 and no doubt other
  places. From this we can determine that Perl is different things to different
  people, but that lots of people think it's at least worth writing about.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Running_Perl_programs"><a class="selflink" href="#Running_Perl_programs">Running
  Perl programs</a></h2>
To run a Perl program from the Unix command line:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    perl progname.pl
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Alternatively, put this as the first line of your script:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    #!/usr/bin/env perl
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
... and run the script as &quot;/path/to/script.pl&quot;. Of course, it'll need
  to be executable first, so &quot;chmod 755 script.pl&quot; (under Unix).
<div class="Pp"></div>
(This start line assumes you have the <b>env</b> program. You can also put
  directly the path to your perl executable, like in
  &quot;#!/usr/bin/perl&quot;).
<div class="Pp"></div>
For more information, including instructions for other platforms such as Windows
  and Mac OS, read perlrun.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Safety_net"><a class="selflink" href="#Safety_net">Safety
  net</a></h2>
Perl by default is very forgiving. In order to make it more robust it is
  recommended to start every program with the following lines:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    #!/usr/bin/perl
    use strict;
    use warnings;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The two additional lines request from perl to catch various common problems in
  your code. They check different things so you need both. A potential problem
  caught by &quot;use strict;&quot; will cause your code to stop immediately
  when it is encountered, while &quot;use warnings;&quot; will merely give a
  warning (like the command-line switch <b>-w</b>) and let your code run. To
  read more about them check their respective manual pages at strict and
  warnings.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Basic_syntax_overview"><a class="selflink" href="#Basic_syntax_overview">Basic
  syntax overview</a></h2>
A Perl script or program consists of one or more statements. These statements
  are simply written in the script in a straightforward fashion. There is no
  need to have a &quot;main()&quot; function or anything of that kind.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Perl statements end in a semi-colon:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    print &quot;Hello, world&quot;;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Comments start with a hash symbol and run to the end of the line
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    # This is a comment
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Whitespace is irrelevant:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    print
        &quot;Hello, world&quot;
        ;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
... except inside quoted strings:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    # this would print with a linebreak in the middle
    print &quot;Hello
    world&quot;;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Double quotes or single quotes may be used around literal strings:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    print &quot;Hello, world&quot;;
    print 'Hello, world';
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
However, only double quotes &quot;interpolate&quot; variables and special
  characters such as newlines (&quot;\n&quot;):
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    print &quot;Hello, $name\n&quot;;     # works fine
    print 'Hello, $name\n';     # prints $name\n literally
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Numbers don't need quotes around them:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    print 42;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can use parentheses for functions' arguments or omit them according to your
  personal taste. They are only required occasionally to clarify issues of
  precedence.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    print(&quot;Hello, world\n&quot;);
    print &quot;Hello, world\n&quot;;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
More detailed information about Perl syntax can be found in perlsyn.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Perl_variable_types"><a class="selflink" href="#Perl_variable_types">Perl
  variable types</a></h2>
Perl has three main variable types: scalars, arrays, and hashes.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">Scalars</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">A scalar represents a single value:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    my $animal = &quot;camel&quot;;
    my $answer = 42;
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Scalar values can be strings, integers or floating point numbers, and Perl
      will automatically convert between them as required. There is no need to
      pre-declare your variable types, but you have to declare them using the
      &quot;my&quot; keyword the first time you use them. (This is one of the
      requirements of &quot;use strict;&quot;.)
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Scalar values can be used in various ways:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    print $animal;
    print &quot;The animal is $animal\n&quot;;
    print &quot;The square of $answer is &quot;, $answer * $answer, &quot;\n&quot;;
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    There are a number of &quot;magic&quot; scalars with names that look like
      punctuation or line noise. These special variables are used for all kinds
      of purposes, and are documented in perlvar. The only one you need to know
      about for now is $_ which is the &quot;default variable&quot;. It's used
      as the default argument to a number of functions in Perl, and it's set
      implicitly by certain looping constructs.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    print;          # prints contents of $_ by default
    </pre>
  </dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">Arrays</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">An array represents a list of values:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    my @animals = (&quot;camel&quot;, &quot;llama&quot;, &quot;owl&quot;);
    my @numbers = (23, 42, 69);
    my @mixed   = (&quot;camel&quot;, 42, 1.23);
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Arrays are zero-indexed. Here's how you get at elements in an array:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    print $animals[0];              # prints &quot;camel&quot;
    print $animals[1];              # prints &quot;llama&quot;
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The special variable $#array tells you the index of the last element of an
      array:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    print $mixed[$#mixed];       # last element, prints 1.23
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    You might be tempted to use &quot;$#array + 1&quot; to tell you how many
      items there are in an array. Don't bother. As it happens, using @array
      where Perl expects to find a scalar value (&quot;in scalar context&quot;)
      will give you the number of elements in the array:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    if (@animals &lt; 5) { ... }
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The elements we're getting from the array start with a &quot;$&quot; because
      we're getting just a single value out of the array; you ask for a scalar,
      you get a scalar.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    To get multiple values from an array:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    @animals[0,1];                  # gives (&quot;camel&quot;, &quot;llama&quot;);
    @animals[0..2];                 # gives (&quot;camel&quot;, &quot;llama&quot;, &quot;owl&quot;);
    @animals[1..$#animals];         # gives all except the first element
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This is called an &quot;array slice&quot;.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    You can do various useful things to lists:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    my @sorted    = sort @animals;
    my @backwards = reverse @numbers;
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    There are a couple of special arrays too, such as @ARGV (the command line
      arguments to your script) and @_ (the arguments passed to a subroutine).
      These are documented in perlvar.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">Hashes</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">A hash represents a set of key/value pairs:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    my %fruit_color = (&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;red&quot;, &quot;banana&quot;, &quot;yellow&quot;);
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    You can use whitespace and the &quot;=&gt;&quot; operator to lay them out
      more nicely:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    my %fruit_color = (
        apple  =&gt; &quot;red&quot;,
        banana =&gt; &quot;yellow&quot;,
    );
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    To get at hash elements:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    $fruit_color{&quot;apple&quot;};           # gives &quot;red&quot;
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    You can get at lists of keys and values with &quot;keys()&quot; and
      &quot;values()&quot;.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    my @fruits = keys %fruit_colors;
    my @colors = values %fruit_colors;
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Hashes have no particular internal order, though you can sort the keys and
      loop through them.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Just like special scalars and arrays, there are also special hashes. The
      most well known of these is %ENV which contains environment variables.
      Read all about it (and other special variables) in perlvar.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Scalars, arrays and hashes are documented more fully in perldata.
<div class="Pp"></div>
More complex data types can be constructed using references, which allow you to
  build lists and hashes within lists and hashes.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A reference is a scalar value and can refer to any other Perl data type. So by
  storing a reference as the value of an array or hash element, you can easily
  create lists and hashes within lists and hashes. The following example shows a
  2 level hash of hash structure using anonymous hash references.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    my $variables = {
        scalar  =&gt;  {
                     description =&gt; &quot;single item&quot;,
                     sigil =&gt; '$',
                    },
        array   =&gt;  {
                     description =&gt; &quot;ordered list of items&quot;,
                     sigil =&gt; '@',
                    },
        hash    =&gt;  {
                     description =&gt; &quot;key/value pairs&quot;,
                     sigil =&gt; '%',
                    },
    };
    print &quot;Scalars begin with a $variables-&gt;{'scalar'}-&gt;{'sigil'}\n&quot;;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Exhaustive information on the topic of references can be found in perlreftut,
  perllol, perlref and perldsc.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Variable_scoping"><a class="selflink" href="#Variable_scoping">Variable
  scoping</a></h2>
Throughout the previous section all the examples have used the syntax:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    my $var = &quot;value&quot;;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The &quot;my&quot; is actually not required; you could just use:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    $var = &quot;value&quot;;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
However, the above usage will create global variables throughout your program,
  which is bad programming practice. &quot;my&quot; creates lexically scoped
  variables instead. The variables are scoped to the block (i.e. a bunch of
  statements surrounded by curly-braces) in which they are defined.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    my $x = &quot;foo&quot;;
    my $some_condition = 1;
    if ($some_condition) {
        my $y = &quot;bar&quot;;
        print $x;           # prints &quot;foo&quot;
        print $y;           # prints &quot;bar&quot;
    }
    print $x;               # prints &quot;foo&quot;
    print $y;               # prints nothing; $y has fallen out of scope
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Using &quot;my&quot; in combination with a &quot;use strict;&quot; at the top of
  your Perl scripts means that the interpreter will pick up certain common
  programming errors. For instance, in the example above, the final &quot;print
  $y&quot; would cause a compile-time error and prevent you from running the
  program. Using &quot;strict&quot; is highly recommended.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Conditional_and_looping_constructs"><a class="selflink" href="#Conditional_and_looping_constructs">Conditional
  and looping constructs</a></h2>
Perl has most of the usual conditional and looping constructs. As of Perl 5.10,
  it even has a case/switch statement (spelled
  &quot;given&quot;/&quot;when&quot;). See &quot;Switch Statements&quot; in
  perlsyn for more details.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The conditions can be any Perl expression. See the list of operators in the next
  section for information on comparison and boolean logic operators, which are
  commonly used in conditional statements.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">if</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">
    <pre>
    if ( condition ) {
        ...
    } elsif ( other condition ) {
        ...
    } else {
        ...
    }
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    There's also a negated version of it:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    unless ( condition ) {
        ...
    }
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This is provided as a more readable version of &quot;if (!
      <i>condition</i>)&quot;.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Note that the braces are required in Perl, even if you've only got one line
      in the block. However, there is a clever way of making your one-line
      conditional blocks more English like:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    # the traditional way
    if ($zippy) {
        print &quot;Yow!&quot;;
    }
    # the Perlish post-condition way
    print &quot;Yow!&quot; if $zippy;
    print &quot;We have no bananas&quot; unless $bananas;
    </pre>
  </dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">while</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">
    <pre>
    while ( condition ) {
        ...
    }
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    There's also a negated version, for the same reason we have
      &quot;unless&quot;:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    until ( condition ) {
        ...
    }
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    You can also use &quot;while&quot; in a post-condition:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    print &quot;LA LA LA\n&quot; while 1;          # loops forever
    </pre>
  </dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">for</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Exactly like C:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    for ($i = 0; $i &lt;= $max; $i++) {
        ...
    }
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The C style for loop is rarely needed in Perl since Perl provides the more
      friendly list scanning &quot;foreach&quot; loop.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">foreach</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">
    <pre>
    foreach (@array) {
        print &quot;This element is $_\n&quot;;
    }
    print $list[$_] foreach 0 .. $max;
    # you don't have to use the default $_ either...
    foreach my $key (keys %hash) {

    }
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The &quot;foreach&quot; keyword is actually a synonym for the

<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Builtin_operators_and_functions"><a class="selflink" href="#Builtin_operators_and_functions">Builtin
  operators and functions</a></h2>
Perl comes with a wide selection of builtin functions. Some of the ones we've
  already seen include &quot;print&quot;, &quot;sort&quot; and
  &quot;reverse&quot;. A list of them is given at the start of perlfunc and you
  can easily read about any given function by using &quot;perldoc -f
  <i>functionname</i>&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Perl operators are documented in full in perlop, but here are a few of the most
  common ones:

Many operators can be combined with a &quot;=&quot; as follows:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    $a += 1;        # same as $a = $a + 1
    $a -= 1;        # same as $a = $a - 1
    $a .= &quot;\n&quot;;     # same as $a = $a . &quot;\n&quot;;
</pre>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Files_and_I/O"><a class="selflink" href="#Files_and_I/O">Files
  and I/O</a></h2>
You can open a file for input or output using the &quot;open()&quot; function.
  It's documented in extravagant detail in perlfunc and perlopentut, but in
  short:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    open(my $in,  &quot;&lt;&quot;,  &quot;input.txt&quot;)  or die &quot;Can't open input.txt: $!&quot;;
    open(my $out, &quot;&gt;&quot;,  &quot;output.txt&quot;) or die &quot;Can't open output.txt: $!&quot;;
    open(my $log, &quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;, &quot;my.log&quot;)     or die &quot;Can't open my.log: $!&quot;;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can read from an open filehandle using the &quot;&lt;&gt;&quot; operator. In
  scalar context it reads a single line from the filehandle, and in list context
  it reads the whole file in, assigning each line to an element of the list:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    my $line  = &lt;$in&gt;;
    my @lines = &lt;$in&gt;;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Reading in the whole file at one time is called slurping. It can be useful but
  it may be a memory hog. Most text file processing can be done a line at a time
  with Perl's looping constructs.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The &quot;&lt;&gt;&quot; operator is most often seen in a &quot;while&quot;
  loop:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    while (&lt;$in&gt;) {     # assigns each line in turn to $_
        print &quot;Just read in this line: $_&quot;;
    }
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
We've already seen how to print to standard output using &quot;print()&quot;.
  However, &quot;print()&quot; can also take an optional first argument
  specifying which filehandle to print to:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    print STDERR &quot;This is your final warning.\n&quot;;
    print $out $record;
    print $log $logmessage;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
When you're done with your filehandles, you should &quot;close()&quot; them
  (though to be honest, Perl will clean up after you if you forget):
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    close $in or die &quot;$in: $!&quot;;
</pre>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Regular_expressions"><a class="selflink" href="#Regular_expressions">Regular
  expressions</a></h2>
Perl's regular expression support is both broad and deep, and is the subject of
  lengthy documentation in perlrequick, perlretut, and elsewhere. However, in
  short:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">Simple matching</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">
    <pre>
    if (/foo/)       { ... }  # true if $_ contains &quot;foo&quot;
    if ($a =~ /foo/) { ... }  # true if $a contains &quot;foo&quot;
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The &quot;//&quot; matching operator is documented in perlop. It operates on
      $_ by default, or can be bound to another variable using the
      &quot;=~&quot; binding operator (also documented in perlop).</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">More complex regular expressions</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">You don't just have to match on fixed strings. In fact, you
      can match on just about anything you could dream of by using more complex
      regular expressions. These are documented at great length in perlre, but
      for the meantime, here's a quick cheat sheet:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    .                   a single character
    \s                  a whitespace character (space, tab, newline, ...)
    \S                  non-whitespace character
    \d                  a digit (0-9)
    \D                  a non-digit
    \w                  a word character (a-z, A-Z, 0-9, _)
    \W                  a non-word character
    [aeiou]             matches a single character in the given set
    [^aeiou]            matches a single character outside the given set
    (foo|bar|baz)       matches any of the alternatives specified
    ^                   start of string
    $                   end of string
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Quantifiers can be used to specify how many of the previous thing you want
      to match on, where &quot;thing&quot; means either a literal character, one
      of the metacharacters listed above, or a group of characters or
      metacharacters in parentheses.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    *                   zero or more of the previous thing
    +                   one or more of the previous thing
    ?                   zero or one of the previous thing
    {3}                 matches exactly 3 of the previous thing
    {3,6}               matches between 3 and 6 of the previous thing
    {3,}                matches 3 or more of the previous thing
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Some brief examples:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    /^\d+/              string starts with one or more digits
    /^$/                nothing in the string (start and end are adjacent)
    /(\d\s){3}/         a three digits, each followed by a whitespace
                        character (eg &quot;3 4 5 &quot;)
    /(a.)+/             matches a string in which every odd-numbered letter
                        is a (eg &quot;abacadaf&quot;)
    # This loop reads from STDIN, and prints non-blank lines:
    while (&lt;&gt;) {
        next if /^$/;
        print;
    }
    </pre>
  </dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">Parentheses for capturing</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">As well as grouping, parentheses serve a second purpose.
      They can be used to capture the results of parts of the regexp match for

<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Writing_subroutines"><a class="selflink" href="#Writing_subroutines">Writing
  subroutines</a></h2>
Writing subroutines is easy:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    sub logger {
        my $logmessage = shift;
        open my $logfile, &quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;, &quot;my.log&quot; or die &quot;Could not open my.log: $!&quot;;
        print $logfile $logmessage;
    }
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Now we can use the subroutine just as any other built-in function:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    logger(&quot;We have a logger subroutine!&quot;);
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
What's that &quot;shift&quot;? Well, the arguments to a subroutine are available
  to us as a special array called @_ (see perlvar for more on that). The default
  argument to the &quot;shift&quot; function just happens to be @_. So &quot;my
  $logmessage = shift;&quot; shifts the first item off the list of arguments and
  assigns it to $logmessage.
<div class="Pp"></div>
We can manipulate @_ in other ways too:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    my ($logmessage, $priority) = @_;       # common
    my $logmessage = $_[0];                 # uncommon, and ugly
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Subroutines can also return values:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    sub square {
        my $num = shift;
        my $result = $num * $num;
        return $result;
    }
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Then use it like:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    $sq = square(8);
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
For more information on writing subroutines, see perlsub.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="OO_Perl"><a class="selflink" href="#OO_Perl">OO
  Perl</a></h2>
OO Perl is relatively simple and is implemented using references which know what
  sort of object they are based on Perl's concept of packages. However, OO Perl
  is largely beyond the scope of this document. Read perlootut and perlobj.
<div class="Pp"></div>
As a beginning Perl programmer, your most common use of OO Perl will be in using
  third-party modules, which are documented below.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Using_Perl_modules"><a class="selflink" href="#Using_Perl_modules">Using
  Perl modules</a></h2>
Perl modules provide a range of features to help you avoid reinventing the
  wheel, and can be downloaded from CPAN ( http://www.cpan.org/ ). A number of
  popular modules are included with the Perl distribution itself.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Categories of modules range from text manipulation to network protocols to
  database integration to graphics. A categorized list of modules is also
  available from CPAN.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To learn how to install modules you download from CPAN, read perlmodinstall.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To learn how to use a particular module, use &quot;perldoc
  <i>Module::Name</i>&quot;. Typically you will want to &quot;use
  <i>Module::Name</i>&quot;, which will then give you access to exported
  functions or an OO interface to the module.
<div class="Pp"></div>
perlfaq contains questions and answers related to many common tasks, and often
  provides suggestions for good CPAN modules to use.
<div class="Pp"></div>
perlmod describes Perl modules in general. perlmodlib lists the modules which
  came with your Perl installation.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you feel the urge to write Perl modules, perlnewmod will give you good
  advice.
