<p>WGET(1) GNU Wget WGET(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
Wget - The non-interactive network downloader.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
wget [option]... [URL]...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
GNU Wget is a free utility for non-interactive download of
files from the Web. It supports HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP
protocols, as well as retrieval through HTTP proxies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Wget is non-interactive, meaning
that it can work in the background, while the user is not
logged on. This allows you to start a retrieval and
disconnect from the system, <br>
letting Wget finish the work. By contrast, most of the Web
browsers require constant user&rsquo;s presence, which can
be a great hindrance when transferring a lot of data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Wget can follow links in HTML,
XHTML, and CSS pages, to create local versions of remote web
sites, fully recreating the directory structure of the
original site. This is <br>
sometimes referred to as &quot;recursive downloading.&quot;
While doing that, Wget respects the Robot Exclusion Standard
(/robots.txt). Wget can be instructed to convert the links
in <br>
downloaded files to point at the local files, for offline
viewing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Wget has been designed for
robustness over slow or unstable network connections; if a
download fails due to a network problem, it will keep
retrying until the whole file has been <br>
retrieved. If the server supports regetting, it will
instruct the server to continue the download from where it
left off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Option Syntax <br>
Since Wget uses GNU getopt to process command-line
arguments, every option has a long form along with the short
one. Long options are more convenient to remember, but take
time <br>
to type. You may freely mix different option styles, or
specify options after the command-line arguments. Thus you
may write:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wget -r --tries=10
http://fly.srk.fer.hr/ -o log</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The space between the option
accepting an argument and the argument may be omitted.
Instead of -o log you can write -olog.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may put several options that
do not require arguments together, like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wget -drc &lt;URL&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is completely equivalent
to:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wget -d -r -c &lt;URL&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since the options can be
specified after the arguments, you may terminate them with
--. So the following will try to download URL -x, reporting
failure to log:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wget -o log -- -x</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The options that accept
comma-separated lists all respect the convention that
specifying an empty list clears its value. This can be
useful to clear the .wgetrc settings. For <br>
instance, if your .wgetrc sets
&quot;exclude_directories&quot; to /cgi-bin, the following
example will first reset it, and then set it to exclude
/~nobody and /~somebody. You can also <br>
clear the lists in .wgetrc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wget -X &quot; -X
/~nobody,/~somebody</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most options that do not accept
arguments are boolean options, so named because their state
can be captured with a yes-or-no (&quot;boolean&quot;)
variable. For example, --follow-ftp <br>
tells Wget to follow FTP links from HTML files and, on the
other hand, --no-glob tells it not to perform file globbing
on FTP URLs. A boolean option is either affirmative or <br>
negative (beginning with --no). All such options share
several properties.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unless stated otherwise, it is
assumed that the default behavior is the opposite of what
the option accomplishes. For example, the documented
existence of --follow-ftp assumes <br>
that the default is to not follow FTP links from HTML
pages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Affirmative options can be
negated by prepending the --no- to the option name; negative
options can be negated by omitting the --no- prefix. This
might seem superfluous---if the <br>
default for an affirmative option is to not do something,
then why provide a way to explicitly turn it off? But the
startup file may in fact change the default. For instance,
<br>
using &quot;follow_ftp = on&quot; in .wgetrc makes Wget
follow FTP links by default, and using --no-follow-ftp is
the only way to restore the factory default from the command
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Basic Startup Options <br>
-V <br>
--version <br>
Display the version of Wget.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h <br>
--help <br>
Print a help message describing all of Wget&rsquo;s
command-line options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b <br>
--background <br>
Go to background immediately after startup. If no output
file is specified via the -o, output is redirected to
wget-log.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e command <br>
--execute command <br>
Execute command as if it were a part of .wgetrc. A command
thus invoked will be executed after the commands in .wgetrc,
thus taking precedence over them. If you need to <br>
specify more than one wgetrc command, use multiple instances
of -e.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Logging and Input File Options
<br>
-o logfile <br>
--output-file=logfile <br>
Log all messages to logfile. The messages are normally
reported to standard error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a logfile <br>
--append-output=logfile <br>
Append to logfile. This is the same as -o, only it appends
to logfile instead of overwriting the old log file. If
logfile does not exist, a new file is created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d <br>
--debug <br>
Turn on debug output, meaning various information important
to the developers of Wget if it does not work properly. Your
system administrator may have chosen to compile Wget <br>
without debug support, in which case -d will not work.
Please note that compiling with debug support is always
safe---Wget compiled with the debug support will not print
any <br>
debug info unless requested with -d.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q <br>
--quiet <br>
Turn off Wget&rsquo;s output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v <br>
--verbose <br>
Turn on verbose output, with all the available data. The
default output is verbose.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nv <br>
--no-verbose <br>
Turn off verbose without being completely quiet (use -q for
that), which means that error messages and basic information
still get printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--report-speed=type <br>
Output bandwidth as type. The only accepted value is
bits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i file <br>
--input-file=file <br>
Read URLs from a local or external file. If - is specified
as file, URLs are read from the standard input. (Use ./- to
read from a file literally named -.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this function is used, no
URLs need be present on the command line. If there are URLs
both on the command line and in an input file, those on the
command lines will be <br>
the first ones to be retrieved. If --force-html is not
specified, then file should consist of a series of URLs, one
per line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, if you specify
--force-html, the document will be regarded as html. In that
case you may have problems with relative links, which you
can solve either by adding <br>
&quot;&lt;base href=&quot;url&quot;&gt;&quot; to the
documents or by specifying --base=url on the command
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the file is an external one,
the document will be automatically treated as html if the
Content-Type matches text/html. Furthermore, the
file&rsquo;s location will be implicitly <br>
used as base href if none was specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F <br>
--force-html <br>
When input is read from a file, force it to be treated as an
HTML file. This enables you to retrieve relative links from
existing HTML files on your local disk, by adding <br>
&quot;&lt;base href=&quot;url&quot;&gt;&quot; to HTML, or
using the --base command-line option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B URL <br>
--base=URL <br>
Resolves relative links using URL as the point of reference,
when reading links from an HTML file specified via the
-i/--input-file option (together with --force-html, or <br>
when the input file was fetched remotely from a server
describing it as HTML). This is equivalent to the presence
of a &quot;BASE&quot; tag in the HTML input file, with URL
as the <br>
value for the &quot;href&quot; attribute.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For instance, if you specify
http://foo/bar/a.html for URL, and Wget reads ../baz/b.html
from the input file, it would be resolved to
http://foo/baz/b.html.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--config=FILE <br>
Specify the location of a startup file you wish to use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Download Options <br>
--bind-address=ADDRESS <br>
When making client TCP/IP connections, bind to ADDRESS on
the local machine. ADDRESS may be specified as a hostname or
IP address. This option can be useful if your machine <br>
is bound to multiple IPs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t number <br>
--tries=number <br>
Set number of retries to number. Specify 0 or inf for
infinite retrying. The default is to retry 20 times, with
the exception of fatal errors like &quot;connection
refused&quot; or <br>
&quot;not found&quot; (404), which are not retried.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O file <br>
--output-document=file <br>
The documents will not be written to the appropriate files,
but all will be concatenated together and written to file.
If - is used as file, documents will be printed to <br>
standard output, disabling link conversion. (Use ./- to
print to a file literally named -.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use of -O is not intended to
mean simply &quot;use the name file instead of the one in
the URL;&quot; rather, it is analogous to shell redirection:
wget -O file http://foo is intended <br>
to work like wget -O - http://foo &gt; file; file will be
truncated immediately, and all downloaded content will be
written there.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For this reason, -N (for
timestamp-checking) is not supported in combination with -O:
since file is always newly created, it will always have a
very new timestamp. A warning <br>
will be issued if this combination is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Similarly, using -r or -p with
-O may not work as you expect: Wget won&rsquo;t just
download the first file to file and then download the rest
to their normal names: all downloaded <br>
content will be placed in file. This was disabled in version
1.11, but has been reinstated (with a warning) in 1.11.2, as
there are some cases where this behavior can <br>
actually have some use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that a combination with -k
is only permitted when downloading a single document, as in
that case it will just convert all relative URIs to external
ones; -k makes no <br>
sense for multiple URIs when they&rsquo;re all being
downloaded to a single file; -k can be used only when the
output is a regular file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nc <br>
--no-clobber <br>
If a file is downloaded more than once in the same
directory, Wget&rsquo;s behavior depends on a few options,
including -nc. In certain cases, the local file will be
clobbered, or <br>
overwritten, upon repeated download. In other cases it will
be preserved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When running Wget without -N,
-nc, -r, or -p, downloading the same file in the same
directory will result in the original copy of file being
preserved and the second copy <br>
being named file.1. If that file is downloaded yet again,
the third copy will be named file.2, and so on. (This is
also the behavior with -nd, even if -r or -p are in <br>
effect.) When -nc is specified, this behavior is suppressed,
and Wget will refuse to download newer copies of file.
Therefore, &quot;&quot;no-clobber&quot;&quot; is actually a
misnomer in this <br>
mode---it&rsquo;s not clobbering that&rsquo;s prevented (as
the numeric suffixes were already preventing clobbering),
but rather the multiple version saving that&rsquo;s
prevented.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When running Wget with -r or -p,
but without -N, -nd, or -nc, re-downloading a file will
result in the new copy simply overwriting the old. Adding
-nc will prevent this <br>
behavior, instead causing the original version to be
preserved and any newer copies on the server to be
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When running Wget with -N, with
or without -r or -p, the decision as to whether or not to
download a newer copy of a file depends on the local and
remote timestamp and size <br>
of the file. -nc may not be specified at the same time as
-N.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that when -nc is specified,
files with the suffixes .html or .htm will be loaded from
the local disk and parsed as if they had been retrieved from
the Web.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--backups=backups <br>
Before (over)writing a file, back up an existing file by
adding a .1 suffix (_1 on VMS) to the file name. Such backup
files are rotated to .2, .3, and so on, up to backups <br>
(and lost beyond that).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c <br>
--continue <br>
Continue getting a partially-downloaded file. This is useful
when you want to finish up a download started by a previous
instance of Wget, or by another program. For <br>
instance:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wget -c
ftp://sunsite.doc.ic.ac.uk/ls-lR.Z</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If there is a file named ls-lR.Z
in the current directory, Wget will assume that it is the
first portion of the remote file, and will ask the server to
continue the retrieval <br>
from an offset equal to the length of the local file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that you don&rsquo;t need
to specify this option if you just want the current
invocation of Wget to retry downloading a file should the
connection be lost midway through. <br>
This is the default behavior. -c only affects resumption of
downloads started prior to this invocation of Wget, and
whose local files are still sitting around.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Without -c, the previous example
would just download the remote file to ls-lR.Z.1, leaving
the truncated ls-lR.Z file alone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Beginning with Wget 1.7, if you
use -c on a non-empty file, and it turns out that the server
does not support continued downloading, Wget will refuse to
start the download <br>
from scratch, which would effectively ruin existing
contents. If you really want the download to start from
scratch, remove the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also beginning with Wget 1.7, if
you use -c on a file which is of equal size as the one on
the server, Wget will refuse to download the file and print
an explanatory message. <br>
The same happens when the file is smaller on the server than
locally (presumably because it was changed on the server
since your last download attempt)---because
&quot;continuing&quot; <br>
is not meaningful, no download occurs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On the other side of the coin,
while using -c, any file that&rsquo;s bigger on the server
than locally will be considered an incomplete download and
only &quot;(length(remote) - <br>
length(local))&quot; bytes will be downloaded and tacked
onto the end of the local file. This behavior can be
desirable in certain cases---for instance, you can use wget
-c to <br>
download just the new portion that&rsquo;s been appended to
a data collection or log file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, if the file is bigger
on the server because it&rsquo;s been changed, as opposed to
just appended to, you&rsquo;ll end up with a garbled file.
Wget has no way of verifying that <br>
the local file is really a valid prefix of the remote file.
You need to be especially careful of this when using -c in
conjunction with -r, since every file will be <br>
considered as an &quot;incomplete download&quot;
candidate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another instance where
you&rsquo;ll get a garbled file if you try to use -c is if
you have a lame HTTP proxy that inserts a &quot;transfer
interrupted&quot; string into the local file. In <br>
the future a &quot;rollback&quot; option may be added to
deal with this case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that -c only works with FTP
servers and with HTTP servers that support the
&quot;Range&quot; header.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--progress=type <br>
Select the type of the progress indicator you wish to use.
Legal indicators are &quot;dot&quot; and
&quot;bar&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;bar&quot; indicator is
used by default. It draws an ASCII progress bar graphics
(a.k.a &quot;thermometer&quot; display) indicating the
status of retrieval. If the output is not a <br>
TTY, the &quot;dot&quot; bar will be used by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use --progress=dot to switch to
the &quot;dot&quot; display. It traces the retrieval by
printing dots on the screen, each dot representing a fixed
amount of downloaded data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When using the dotted retrieval,
you may also set the style by specifying the type as
dot:style. Different styles assign different meaning to one
dot. With the &quot;default&quot; <br>
style each dot represents 1K, there are ten dots in a
cluster and 50 dots in a line. The &quot;binary&quot; style
has a more &quot;computer&quot;-like orientation---8K dots,
16-dots clusters <br>
and 48 dots per line (which makes for 384K lines). The
&quot;mega&quot; style is suitable for downloading very
large files---each dot represents 64K retrieved, there are
eight dots in <br>
a cluster, and 48 dots on each line (so each line contains
3M).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that you can set the
default style using the &quot;progress&quot; command in
.wgetrc. That setting may be overridden from the command
line. The exception is that, when the <br>
output is not a TTY, the &quot;dot&quot; progress will be
favored over &quot;bar&quot;. To force the bar output, use
--progress=bar:force.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N <br>
--timestamping <br>
Turn on time-stamping.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-use-server-timestamps <br>
Don&rsquo;t set the local file&rsquo;s timestamp by the one
on the server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, when a file is
downloaded, it&rsquo;s timestamps are set to match those
from the remote file. This allows the use of --timestamping
on subsequent invocations of wget. <br>
However, it is sometimes useful to base the local
file&rsquo;s timestamp on when it was actually downloaded;
for that purpose, the --no-use-server-timestamps option has
been <br>
provided.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S <br>
--server-response <br>
Print the headers sent by HTTP servers and responses sent by
FTP servers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--spider <br>
When invoked with this option, Wget will behave as a Web
spider, which means that it will not download the pages,
just check that they are there. For example, you can use
<br>
Wget to check your bookmarks:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wget --spider --force-html -i
bookmarks.html</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This feature needs much more
work for Wget to get close to the functionality of real web
spiders.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T seconds <br>
--timeout=seconds <br>
Set the network timeout to seconds seconds. This is
equivalent to specifying --dns-timeout, --connect-timeout,
and --read-timeout, all at the same time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When interacting with the
network, Wget can check for timeout and abort the operation
if it takes too long. This prevents anomalies like hanging
reads and infinite connects. <br>
The only timeout enabled by default is a 900-second read
timeout. Setting a timeout to 0 disables it altogether.
Unless you know what you are doing, it is best not to <br>
change the default timeout settings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All timeout-related options
accept decimal values, as well as subsecond values. For
example, 0.1 seconds is a legal (though unwise) choice of
timeout. Subsecond timeouts <br>
are useful for checking server response times or for testing
network latency.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dns-timeout=seconds <br>
Set the DNS lookup timeout to seconds seconds. DNS lookups
that don&rsquo;t complete within the specified time will
fail. By default, there is no timeout on DNS lookups, other
<br>
than that implemented by system libraries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--connect-timeout=seconds <br>
Set the connect timeout to seconds seconds. TCP connections
that take longer to establish will be aborted. By default,
there is no connect timeout, other than that <br>
implemented by system libraries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--read-timeout=seconds <br>
Set the read (and write) timeout to seconds seconds. The
&quot;time&quot; of this timeout refers to idle time: if, at
any point in the download, no data is received for more than
the <br>
specified number of seconds, reading fails and the download
is restarted. This option does not directly affect the
duration of the entire download.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Of course, the remote server may
choose to terminate the connection sooner than this option
requires. The default read timeout is 900 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--limit-rate=amount <br>
Limit the download speed to amount bytes per second. Amount
may be expressed in bytes, kilobytes with the k suffix, or
megabytes with the m suffix. For example, <br>
--limit-rate=20k will limit the retrieval rate to 20KB/s.
This is useful when, for whatever reason, you don&rsquo;t
want Wget to consume the entire available bandwidth.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option allows the use of
decimal numbers, usually in conjunction with power suffixes;
for example, --limit-rate=2.5k is a legal value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that Wget implements the
limiting by sleeping the appropriate amount of time after a
network read that took less time than specified by the rate.
Eventually this <br>
strategy causes the TCP transfer to slow down to
approximately the specified rate. However, it may take some
time for this balance to be achieved, so don&rsquo;t be
surprised if <br>
limiting the rate doesn&rsquo;t work well with very small
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w seconds <br>
--wait=seconds <br>
Wait the specified number of seconds between the retrievals.
Use of this option is recommended, as it lightens the server
load by making the requests less frequent. Instead <br>
of in seconds, the time can be specified in minutes using
the &quot;m&quot; suffix, in hours using &quot;h&quot;
suffix, or in days using &quot;d&quot; suffix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specifying a large value for
this option is useful if the network or the destination host
is down, so that Wget can wait long enough to reasonably
expect the network error to <br>
be fixed before the retry. The waiting interval specified by
this function is influenced by &quot;--random-wait&quot;,
which see.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--waitretry=seconds <br>
If you don&rsquo;t want Wget to wait between every
retrieval, but only between retries of failed downloads, you
can use this option. Wget will use linear backoff, waiting 1
second <br>
after the first failure on a given file, then waiting 2
seconds after the second failure on that file, up to the
maximum number of seconds you specify.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, Wget will assume a
value of 10 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--random-wait <br>
Some web sites may perform log analysis to identify
retrieval programs such as Wget by looking for statistically
significant similarities in the time between requests. This
<br>
option causes the time between requests to vary between 0.5
and 1.5 * wait seconds, where wait was specified using the
--wait option, in order to mask Wget&rsquo;s presence from
<br>
such analysis.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A 2001 article in a publication
devoted to development on a popular consumer platform
provided code to perform this analysis on the fly. Its
author suggested blocking at the <br>
class C address level to ensure automated retrieval programs
were blocked despite changing DHCP-supplied addresses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The --random-wait option was
inspired by this ill-advised recommendation to block many
unrelated users from a web site due to the actions of
one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-proxy <br>
Don&rsquo;t use proxies, even if the appropriate *_proxy
environment variable is defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Q quota <br>
--quota=quota <br>
Specify download quota for automatic retrievals. The value
can be specified in bytes (default), kilobytes (with k
suffix), or megabytes (with m suffix).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that quota will never
affect downloading a single file. So if you specify wget
-Q10k ftp://wuarchive.wustl.edu/ls-lR.gz, all of the
ls-lR.gz will be downloaded. The <br>
same goes even when several URLs are specified on the
command-line. However, quota is respected when retrieving
either recursively, or from an input file. Thus you may <br>
safely type wget -Q2m -i sites---download will be aborted
when the quota is exceeded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Setting quota to 0 or to inf
unlimits the download quota.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-dns-cache <br>
Turn off caching of DNS lookups. Normally, Wget remembers
the IP addresses it looked up from DNS so it doesn&rsquo;t
have to repeatedly contact the DNS server for the same <br>
(typically small) set of hosts it retrieves from. This cache
exists in memory only; a new Wget run will contact DNS
again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, it has been reported
that in some situations it is not desirable to cache host
names, even for the duration of a short-running application
like Wget. With this <br>
option Wget issues a new DNS lookup (more precisely, a new
call to &quot;gethostbyname&quot; or
&quot;getaddrinfo&quot;) each time it makes a new
connection. Please note that this option will <br>
not affect caching that might be performed by the resolving
library or by an external caching layer, such as NSCD.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you don&rsquo;t understand
exactly what this option does, you probably won&rsquo;t need
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--restrict-file-names=modes <br>
Change which characters found in remote URLs must be escaped
during generation of local filenames. Characters that are
restricted by this option are escaped, i.e. replaced <br>
with %HH, where HH is the hexadecimal number that
corresponds to the restricted character. This option may
also be used to force all alphabetical cases to be either
lower- or <br>
uppercase.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, Wget escapes the
characters that are not valid or safe as part of file names
on your operating system, as well as control characters that
are typically <br>
unprintable. This option is useful for changing these
defaults, perhaps because you are downloading to a
non-native partition, or because you want to disable
escaping of the <br>
control characters, or you want to further restrict
characters to only those in the ASCII range of values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The modes are a comma-separated
set of text values. The acceptable values are unix, windows,
nocontrol, ascii, lowercase, and uppercase. The values unix
and windows are <br>
mutually exclusive (one will override the other), as are
lowercase and uppercase. Those last are special cases, as
they do not change the set of characters that would be <br>
escaped, but rather force local file paths to be converted
either to lower- or uppercase.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When &quot;unix&quot; is
specified, Wget escapes the character / and the control
characters in the ranges 0--31 and 128--159. This is the
default on Unix-like operating systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When &quot;windows&quot; is
given, Wget escapes the characters |, /, :, ?, &quot;, *,
&lt;, &gt;, and the control characters in the ranges 0--31
and 128--159. In addition to this, Wget in <br>
Windows mode uses + instead of : to separate host and port
in local file names, and uses @ instead of ? to separate the
query portion of the file name from the rest. <br>
Therefore, a URL that would be saved as
www.xemacs.org:4300/search.pl?input=blah in Unix mode would
be saved as www.xemacs.org+4300/search.pl@input=blah in
Windows mode. <br>
This mode is the default on Windows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you specify nocontrol, then
the escaping of the control characters is also switched off.
This option may make sense when you are downloading URLs
whose names contain UTF-8 <br>
characters, on a system which can save and display filenames
in UTF-8 (some possible byte values used in UTF-8 byte
sequences fall in the range of values designated by Wget
<br>
as &quot;controls&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ascii mode is used to
specify that any bytes whose values are outside the range of
ASCII characters (that is, greater than 127) shall be
escaped. This can be useful when <br>
saving filenames whose encoding does not match the one used
locally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-4 <br>
--inet4-only <br>
-6 <br>
--inet6-only <br>
Force connecting to IPv4 or IPv6 addresses. With
--inet4-only or -4, Wget will only connect to IPv4 hosts,
ignoring AAAA records in DNS, and refusing to connect to
IPv6 <br>
addresses specified in URLs. Conversely, with --inet6-only
or -6, Wget will only connect to IPv6 hosts and ignore A
records and IPv4 addresses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Neither options should be needed
normally. By default, an IPv6-aware Wget will use the
address family specified by the host&rsquo;s DNS record. If
the DNS responds with both IPv4 <br>
and IPv6 addresses, Wget will try them in sequence until it
finds one it can connect to. (Also see
&quot;--prefer-family&quot; option described below.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These options can be used to
deliberately force the use of IPv4 or IPv6 address families
on dual family systems, usually to aid debugging or to deal
with broken network <br>
configuration. Only one of --inet6-only and --inet4-only may
be specified at the same time. Neither option is available
in Wget compiled without IPv6 support.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--prefer-family=none/IPv4/IPv6
<br>
When given a choice of several addresses, connect to the
addresses with specified address family first. The address
order returned by DNS is used without change by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This avoids spurious errors and
connect attempts when accessing hosts that resolve to both
IPv6 and IPv4 addresses from IPv4 networks. For example,
www.kame.net resolves to <br>
2001:200:0:8002:203:47ff:fea5:3085 and to 203.178.141.194.
When the preferred family is &quot;IPv4&quot;, the IPv4
address is used first; when the preferred family is
&quot;IPv6&quot;, the IPv6 <br>
address is used first; if the specified value is
&quot;none&quot;, the address order returned by DNS is used
without change.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unlike -4 and -6, this option
doesn&rsquo;t inhibit access to any address family, it only
changes the order in which the addresses are accessed. Also
note that the reordering <br>
performed by this option is stable---it doesn&rsquo;t affect
order of addresses of the same family. That is, the relative
order of all IPv4 addresses and of all IPv6 addresses <br>
remains intact in all cases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--retry-connrefused <br>
Consider &quot;connection refused&quot; a transient error
and try again. Normally Wget gives up on a URL when it is
unable to connect to the site because failure to connect is
taken <br>
as a sign that the server is not running at all and that
retries would not help. This option is for mirroring
unreliable sites whose servers tend to disappear for short
<br>
periods of time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--user=user <br>
--password=password <br>
Specify the username user and password password for both FTP
and HTTP file retrieval. These parameters can be overridden
using the --ftp-user and --ftp-password options for <br>
FTP connections and the --http-user and --http-password
options for HTTP connections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ask-password <br>
Prompt for a password for each connection established.
Cannot be specified when --password is being used, because
they are mutually exclusive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-iri <br>
Turn off internationalized URI (IRI) support. Use --iri to
turn it on. IRI support is activated by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can set the default state of
IRI support using the &quot;iri&quot; command in .wgetrc.
That setting may be overridden from the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--local-encoding=encoding <br>
Force Wget to use encoding as the default system encoding.
That affects how Wget converts URLs specified as arguments
from locale to UTF-8 for IRI support.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Wget use the function
&quot;nl_langinfo()&quot; and then the &quot;CHARSET&quot;
environment variable to get the locale. If it fails, ASCII
is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can set the default local
encoding using the &quot;local_encoding&quot; command in
.wgetrc. That setting may be overridden from the command
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--remote-encoding=encoding <br>
Force Wget to use encoding as the default remote server
encoding. That affects how Wget converts URIs found in files
from remote encoding to UTF-8 during a recursive fetch. <br>
This options is only useful for IRI support, for the
interpretation of non-ASCII characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For HTTP, remote encoding can be
found in HTTP &quot;Content-Type&quot; header and in HTML
&quot;Content-Type http-equiv&quot; meta tag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can set the default encoding
using the &quot;remoteencoding&quot; command in .wgetrc.
That setting may be overridden from the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--unlink <br>
Force Wget to unlink file instead of clobbering existing
file. This option is useful for downloading to the directory
with hardlinks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Directory Options <br>
-nd <br>
--no-directories <br>
Do not create a hierarchy of directories when retrieving
recursively. With this option turned on, all files will get
saved to the current directory, without clobbering (if a
<br>
name shows up more than once, the filenames will get
extensions .n).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x <br>
--force-directories <br>
The opposite of -nd---create a hierarchy of directories,
even if one would not have been created otherwise. E.g. wget
-x http://fly.srk.fer.hr/robots.txt will save the <br>
downloaded file to fly.srk.fer.hr/robots.txt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nH <br>
--no-host-directories <br>
Disable generation of host-prefixed directories. By default,
invoking Wget with -r http://fly.srk.fer.hr/ will create a
structure of directories beginning with <br>
fly.srk.fer.hr/. This option disables such behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--protocol-directories <br>
Use the protocol name as a directory component of local file
names. For example, with this option, wget -r http://host
will save to http/host/... rather than just to <br>
host/....</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--cut-dirs=number <br>
Ignore number directory components. This is useful for
getting a fine-grained control over the directory where
recursive retrieval will be saved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Take, for example, the directory
at ftp://ftp.xemacs.org/pub/xemacs/. If you retrieve it with
-r, it will be saved locally under
ftp.xemacs.org/pub/xemacs/. While the -nH <br>
option can remove the ftp.xemacs.org/ part, you are still
stuck with pub/xemacs. This is where --cut-dirs comes in
handy; it makes Wget not &quot;see&quot; number remote
directory <br>
components. Here are several examples of how --cut-dirs
option works.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">No options -&gt;
ftp.xemacs.org/pub/xemacs/ <br>
-nH -&gt; pub/xemacs/ <br>
-nH --cut-dirs=1 -&gt; xemacs/ <br>
-nH --cut-dirs=2 -&gt; .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--cut-dirs=1 -&gt;
ftp.xemacs.org/xemacs/ <br>
...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you just want to get rid of
the directory structure, this option is similar to a
combination of -nd and -P. However, unlike -nd, --cut-dirs
does not lose with <br>
subdirectories---for instance, with -nH --cut-dirs=1, a
beta/ subdirectory will be placed to xemacs/beta, as one
would expect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P prefix <br>
--directory-prefix=prefix <br>
Set directory prefix to prefix. The directory prefix is the
directory where all other files and subdirectories will be
saved to, i.e. the top of the retrieval tree. The <br>
default is . (the current directory).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HTTP Options <br>
--default-page=name <br>
Use name as the default file name when it isn&rsquo;t known
(i.e., for URLs that end in a slash), instead of
index.html.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E <br>
--adjust-extension <br>
If a file of type application/xhtml+xml or text/html is
downloaded and the URL does not end with the regexp
.[Hh][Tt][Mm][Ll]?, this option will cause the suffix .html
to be <br>
appended to the local filename. This is useful, for
instance, when you&rsquo;re mirroring a remote site that
uses .asp pages, but you want the mirrored pages to be
viewable on <br>
your stock Apache server. Another good use for this is when
you&rsquo;re downloading CGI-generated materials. A URL like
http://site.com/article.cgi?25 will be saved as <br>
article.cgi?25.html.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that filenames changed in
this way will be re-downloaded every time you re-mirror a
site, because Wget can&rsquo;t tell that the local X.html
file corresponds to remote URL X <br>
(since it doesn&rsquo;t yet know that the URL produces
output of type text/html or application/xhtml+xml.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As of version 1.12, Wget will
also ensure that any downloaded files of type text/css end
in the suffix .css, and the option was renamed from
--html-extension, to better <br>
reflect its new behavior. The old option name is still
acceptable, but should now be considered deprecated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At some point in the future,
this option may well be expanded to include suffixes for
other types of content, including content types that are not
parsed by Wget.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--http-user=user <br>
--http-password=password <br>
Specify the username user and password password on an HTTP
server. According to the type of the challenge, Wget will
encode them using either the &quot;basic&quot; (insecure),
the <br>
&quot;digest&quot;, or the Windows &quot;NTLM&quot;
authentication scheme.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another way to specify username
and password is in the URL itself. Either method reveals
your password to anyone who bothers to run &quot;ps&quot;.
To prevent the passwords from <br>
being seen, store them in .wgetrc or .netrc, and make sure
to protect those files from other users with
&quot;chmod&quot;. If the passwords are really important, do
not leave them <br>
lying in those files either---edit the files and delete them
after Wget has started the download.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-http-keep-alive <br>
Turn off the &quot;keep-alive&quot; feature for HTTP
downloads. Normally, Wget asks the server to keep the
connection open so that, when you download more than one
document from the <br>
same server, they get transferred over the same TCP
connection. This saves time and at the same time reduces the
load on the server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is useful when, for
some reason, persistent (keep-alive) connections don&rsquo;t
work for you, for example due to a server bug or due to the
inability of server-side <br>
scripts to cope with the connections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-cache <br>
Disable server-side cache. In this case, Wget will send the
remote server an appropriate directive (Pragma: no-cache) to
get the file from the remote service, rather than <br>
returning the cached version. This is especially useful for
retrieving and flushing out-of-date documents on proxy
servers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Caching is allowed by
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-cookies <br>
Disable the use of cookies. Cookies are a mechanism for
maintaining server-side state. The server sends the client a
cookie using the &quot;Set-Cookie&quot; header, and the
client <br>
responds with the same cookie upon further requests. Since
cookies allow the server owners to keep track of visitors
and for sites to exchange this information, some <br>
consider them a breach of privacy. The default is to use
cookies; however, storing cookies is not on by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--load-cookies file <br>
Load cookies from file before the first HTTP retrieval. file
is a textual file in the format originally used by
Netscape&rsquo;s cookies.txt file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You will typically use this
option when mirroring sites that require that you be logged
in to access some or all of their content. The login process
typically works by the <br>
web server issuing an HTTP cookie upon receiving and
verifying your credentials. The cookie is then resent by the
browser when accessing that part of the site, and so proves
<br>
your identity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mirroring such a site requires
Wget to send the same cookies your browser sends when
communicating with the site. This is achieved by
--load-cookies---simply point Wget to <br>
the location of the cookies.txt file, and it will send the
same cookies your browser would send in the same situation.
Different browsers keep textual cookie files in <br>
different locations:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;Netscape 4.x.&quot; <br>
The cookies are in ~/.netscape/cookies.txt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;Mozilla and Netscape
6.x.&quot; <br>
Mozilla&rsquo;s cookie file is also named cookies.txt,
located somewhere under ~/.mozilla, in the directory of your
profile. The full path usually ends up looking somewhat <br>
like ~/.mozilla/default/some-weird-string/cookies.txt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;Internet Explorer.&quot;
<br>
You can produce a cookie file Wget can use by using the File
menu, Import and Export, Export Cookies. This has been
tested with Internet Explorer 5; it is not guaranteed <br>
to work with earlier versions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;Other browsers.&quot; <br>
If you are using a different browser to create your cookies,
--load-cookies will only work if you can locate or produce a
cookie file in the Netscape format that Wget <br>
expects.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you cannot use
--load-cookies, there might still be an alternative. If your
browser supports a &quot;cookie manager&quot;, you can use
it to view the cookies used when accessing <br>
the site you&rsquo;re mirroring. Write down the name and
value of the cookie, and manually instruct Wget to send
those cookies, bypassing the &quot;official&quot; cookie
support:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wget --no-cookies --header
&quot;Cookie: &lt;name&gt;=&lt;value&gt;&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--save-cookies file <br>
Save cookies to file before exiting. This will not save
cookies that have expired or that have no expiry time
(so-called &quot;session cookies&quot;), but also see <br>
--keep-session-cookies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--keep-session-cookies <br>
When specified, causes --save-cookies to also save session
cookies. Session cookies are normally not saved because they
are meant to be kept in memory and forgotten when you <br>
exit the browser. Saving them is useful on sites that
require you to log in or to visit the home page before you
can access some pages. With this option, multiple Wget runs
<br>
are considered a single browser session as far as the site
is concerned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since the cookie file format
does not normally carry session cookies, Wget marks them
with an expiry timestamp of 0. Wget&rsquo;s --load-cookies
recognizes those as session <br>
cookies, but it might confuse other browsers. Also note that
cookies so loaded will be treated as other session cookies,
which means that if you want --save-cookies to <br>
preserve them again, you must use --keep-session-cookies
again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ignore-length <br>
Unfortunately, some HTTP servers (CGI programs, to be more
precise) send out bogus &quot;Content-Length&quot; headers,
which makes Wget go wild, as it thinks not all the document
was <br>
retrieved. You can spot this syndrome if Wget retries
getting the same document again and again, each time
claiming that the (otherwise normal) connection has closed
on the <br>
very same byte.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With this option, Wget will
ignore the &quot;Content-Length&quot; header---as if it
never existed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--header=header-line <br>
Send header-line along with the rest of the headers in each
HTTP request. The supplied header is sent as-is, which means
it must contain name and value separated by colon, <br>
and must not contain newlines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may define more than one
additional header by specifying --header more than once.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wget
--header=&rsquo;Accept-Charset: iso-8859-2&rsquo;
--header=&rsquo;Accept-Language: hr&rsquo;
http://fly.srk.fer.hr/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specification of an empty string
as the header value will clear all previous user-defined
headers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As of Wget 1.10, this option can
be used to override headers otherwise generated
automatically. This example instructs Wget to connect to
localhost, but to specify foo.bar <br>
in the &quot;Host&quot; header:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wget --header=&quot;Host:
foo.bar&quot; http://localhost/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In versions of Wget prior to
1.10 such use of --header caused sending of duplicate
headers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--max-redirect=number <br>
Specifies the maximum number of redirections to follow for a
resource. The default is 20, which is usually far more than
necessary. However, on those occasions where you <br>
want to allow more (or fewer), this is the option to
use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--proxy-user=user <br>
--proxy-password=password <br>
Specify the username user and password password for
authentication on a proxy server. Wget will encode them
using the &quot;basic&quot; authentication scheme.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Security considerations similar
to those with --http-password pertain here as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--referer=url <br>
Include &lsquo;Referer: url&rsquo; header in HTTP request.
Useful for retrieving documents with server-side processing
that assume they are always being retrieved by interactive
web <br>
browsers and only come out properly when Referer is set to
one of the pages that point to them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--save-headers <br>
Save the headers sent by the HTTP server to the file,
preceding the actual contents, with an empty line as the
separator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U agent-string <br>
--user-agent=agent-string <br>
Identify as agent-string to the HTTP server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The HTTP protocol allows the
clients to identify themselves using a
&quot;User-Agent&quot; header field. This enables
distinguishing the WWW software, usually for statistical
purposes <br>
or for tracing of protocol violations. Wget normally
identifies as Wget/version, version being the current
version number of Wget.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, some sites have been
known to impose the policy of tailoring the output according
to the &quot;User-Agent&quot;-supplied information. While
this is not such a bad idea in <br>
theory, it has been abused by servers denying information to
clients other than (historically) Netscape or, more
frequently, Microsoft Internet Explorer. This option allows
<br>
you to change the &quot;User-Agent&quot; line issued by
Wget. Use of this option is discouraged, unless you really
know what you are doing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specifying empty user agent with
--user-agent=&quot;&quot; instructs Wget not to send the
&quot;User-Agent&quot; header in HTTP requests.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--post-data=string <br>
--post-file=file <br>
Use POST as the method for all HTTP requests and send the
specified data in the request body. --post-data sends string
as data, whereas --post-file sends the contents of <br>
file. Other than that, they work in exactly the same way. In
particular, they both expect content of the form
&quot;key1=value1&amp;key2=value2&quot;, with
percent-encoding for special <br>
characters; the only difference is that one expects its
content as a command-line parameter and the other accepts
its content from a file. In particular, --post-file is not
<br>
for transmitting files as form attachments: those must
appear as &quot;key=value&quot; data (with appropriate
percent-coding) just like everything else. Wget does not
currently support <br>
&quot;multipart/form-data&quot; for transmitting POST data;
only &quot;application/x-www-form-urlencoded&quot;. Only one
of --post-data and --post-file should be specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please be aware that Wget needs
to know the size of the POST data in advance. Therefore the
argument to &quot;--post-file&quot; must be a regular file;
specifying a FIFO or something <br>
like /dev/stdin won&rsquo;t work. It&rsquo;s not quite clear
how to work around this limitation inherent in HTTP/1.0.
Although HTTP/1.1 introduces chunked transfer that
doesn&rsquo;t require <br>
knowing the request length in advance, a client can&rsquo;t
use chunked unless it knows it&rsquo;s talking to an
HTTP/1.1 server. And it can&rsquo;t know that until it
receives a response, <br>
which in turn requires the request to have been completed --
a chicken-and-egg problem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: if Wget is redirected
after the POST request is completed, it will not send the
POST data to the redirected URL. This is because URLs that
process POST often respond <br>
with a redirection to a regular page, which does not desire
or accept POST. It is not completely clear that this
behavior is optimal; if it doesn&rsquo;t work out, it might
be <br>
changed in the future.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This example shows how to log to
a server using POST and then proceed to download the desired
pages, presumably only accessible to authorized users:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Log in to the server. This can
be done only once. <br>
wget --save-cookies cookies.txt --post-data
&rsquo;user=foo&amp;password=bar&rsquo;
http://server.com/auth.php</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Now grab the page or pages we
care about. <br>
wget --load-cookies cookies.txt -p
http://server.com/interesting/article.php</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the server is using session
cookies to track user authentication, the above will not
work because --save-cookies will not save them (and neither
will browsers) and the <br>
cookies.txt file will be empty. In that case use
--keep-session-cookies along with --save-cookies to force
saving of session cookies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--content-disposition <br>
If this is set to on, experimental (not fully-functional)
support for &quot;Content-Disposition&quot; headers is
enabled. This can currently result in extra round-trips to
the server <br>
for a &quot;HEAD&quot; request, and is known to suffer from
a few bugs, which is why it is not currently enabled by
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is useful for some
file-downloading CGI programs that use
&quot;Content-Disposition&quot; headers to describe what the
name of a downloaded file should be.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--content-on-error <br>
If this is set to on, wget will not skip the content when
the server responds with a http status code that indicates
error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--trust-server-names <br>
If this is set to on, on a redirect the last component of
the redirection URL will be used as the local file name. By
default it is used the last component in the original <br>
URL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--auth-no-challenge <br>
If this option is given, Wget will send Basic HTTP
authentication information (plaintext username and password)
for all requests, just like Wget 1.10.2 and prior did by
<br>
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use of this option is not
recommended, and is intended only to support some few
obscure servers, which never send HTTP authentication
challenges, but accept unsolicited auth <br>
info, say, in addition to form-based authentication.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HTTPS (SSL/TLS) Options <br>
To support encrypted HTTP (HTTPS) downloads, Wget must be
compiled with an external SSL library, currently OpenSSL. If
Wget is compiled without SSL support, none of these <br>
options are available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--secure-protocol=protocol <br>
Choose the secure protocol to be used. Legal values are
auto, SSLv2, SSLv3, and TLSv1. If auto is used, the SSL
library is given the liberty of choosing the appropriate
<br>
protocol automatically, which is achieved by sending an
SSLv2 greeting and announcing support for SSLv3 and TLSv1.
This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specifying SSLv2, SSLv3, or
TLSv1 forces the use of the corresponding protocol. This is
useful when talking to old and buggy SSL server
implementations that make it hard for <br>
OpenSSL to choose the correct protocol version. Fortunately,
such servers are quite rare.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-check-certificate <br>
Don&rsquo;t check the server certificate against the
available certificate authorities. Also don&rsquo;t require
the URL host name to match the common name presented by the
certificate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As of Wget 1.10, the default is
to verify the server&rsquo;s certificate against the
recognized certificate authorities, breaking the SSL
handshake and aborting the download if the <br>
verification fails. Although this provides more secure
downloads, it does break interoperability with some sites
that worked with previous Wget versions, particularly those
<br>
using self-signed, expired, or otherwise invalid
certificates. This option forces an &quot;insecure&quot;
mode of operation that turns the certificate verification
errors into <br>
warnings and allows you to proceed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you encounter
&quot;certificate verification&quot; errors or ones saying
that &quot;common name doesn&rsquo;t match requested host
name&quot;, you can use this option to bypass the
verification and <br>
proceed with the download. Only use this option if you are
otherwise convinced of the site&rsquo;s authenticity, or if
you really don&rsquo;t care about the validity of its
certificate. <br>
It is almost always a bad idea not to check the certificates
when transmitting confidential or important data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--certificate=file <br>
Use the client certificate stored in file. This is needed
for servers that are configured to require certificates from
the clients that connect to them. Normally a <br>
certificate is not required and this switch is optional.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--certificate-type=type <br>
Specify the type of the client certificate. Legal values are
PEM (assumed by default) and DER, also known as ASN1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--private-key=file <br>
Read the private key from file. This allows you to provide
the private key in a file separate from the certificate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--private-key-type=type <br>
Specify the type of the private key. Accepted values are PEM
(the default) and DER.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ca-certificate=file <br>
Use file as the file with the bundle of certificate
authorities (&quot;CA&quot;) to verify the peers. The
certificates must be in PEM format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Without this option Wget looks
for CA certificates at the system-specified locations,
chosen at OpenSSL installation time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ca-directory=directory <br>
Specifies directory containing CA certificates in PEM
format. Each file contains one CA certificate, and the file
name is based on a hash value derived from the certificate.
<br>
This is achieved by processing a certificate directory with
the &quot;c_rehash&quot; utility supplied with OpenSSL.
Using --ca-directory is more efficient than --ca-certificate
when <br>
many certificates are installed because it allows Wget to
fetch certificates on demand.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Without this option Wget looks
for CA certificates at the system-specified locations,
chosen at OpenSSL installation time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--random-file=file <br>
Use file as the source of random data for seeding the
pseudo-random number generator on systems without
/dev/random.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On such systems the SSL library
needs an external source of randomness to initialize.
Randomness may be provided by EGD (see --egd-file below) or
read from an external <br>
source specified by the user. If this option is not
specified, Wget looks for random data in $RANDFILE or, if
that is unset, in $HOME/.rnd. If none of those are
available, <br>
it is likely that SSL encryption will not be usable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you&rsquo;re getting the
&quot;Could not seed OpenSSL PRNG; disabling SSL.&quot;
error, you should provide random data using some of the
methods described above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--egd-file=file <br>
Use file as the EGD socket. EGD stands for Entropy Gathering
Daemon, a user-space program that collects data from various
unpredictable system sources and makes it available <br>
to other programs that might need it. Encryption software,
such as the SSL library, needs sources of non-repeating
randomness to seed the random number generator used to <br>
produce cryptographically strong keys.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OpenSSL allows the user to
specify his own source of entropy using the
&quot;RAND_FILE&quot; environment variable. If this variable
is unset, or if the specified file does not produce <br>
enough randomness, OpenSSL will read random data from EGD
socket specified using this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option is not specified
(and the equivalent startup command is not used), EGD is
never contacted. EGD is not needed on modern Unix systems
that support /dev/random.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--warc-file=file <br>
Use file as the destination WARC file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--warc-header=string <br>
Use string into as the warcinfo record.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--warc-max-size=size <br>
Set the maximum size of the WARC files to size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--warc-cdx <br>
Write CDX index files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--warc-dedup=file <br>
Do not store records listed in this CDX file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-warc-compression <br>
Do not compress WARC files with GZIP.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-warc-digests <br>
Do not calculate SHA1 digests.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-warc-keep-log <br>
Do not store the log file in a WARC record.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--warc-tempdir=dir <br>
Specify the location for temporary files created by the WARC
writer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FTP Options <br>
--ftp-user=user <br>
--ftp-password=password <br>
Specify the username user and password password on an FTP
server. Without this, or the corresponding startup option,
the password defaults to -wget@, normally used for <br>
anonymous FTP.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another way to specify username
and password is in the URL itself. Either method reveals
your password to anyone who bothers to run &quot;ps&quot;.
To prevent the passwords from <br>
being seen, store them in .wgetrc or .netrc, and make sure
to protect those files from other users with
&quot;chmod&quot;. If the passwords are really important, do
not leave them <br>
lying in those files either---edit the files and delete them
after Wget has started the download.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-remove-listing <br>
Don&rsquo;t remove the temporary .listing files generated by
FTP retrievals. Normally, these files contain the raw
directory listings received from FTP servers. Not removing
them <br>
can be useful for debugging purposes, or when you want to be
able to easily check on the contents of remote server
directories (e.g. to verify that a mirror you&rsquo;re
running is <br>
complete).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that even though Wget
writes to a known filename for this file, this is not a
security hole in the scenario of a user making .listing a
symbolic link to /etc/passwd or <br>
something and asking &quot;root&quot; to run Wget in his or
her directory. Depending on the options used, either Wget
will refuse to write to .listing, making the <br>
globbing/recursion/time-stamping operation fail, or the
symbolic link will be deleted and replaced with the actual
.listing file, or the listing will be written to a <br>
.listing.number file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Even though this situation
isn&rsquo;t a problem, though, &quot;root&quot; should never
run Wget in a non-trusted user&rsquo;s directory. A user
could do something as simple as linking index.html <br>
to /etc/passwd and asking &quot;root&quot; to run Wget with
-N or -r so the file will be overwritten.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-glob <br>
Turn off FTP globbing. Globbing refers to the use of
shell-like special characters (wildcards), like *, ?, [ and
] to retrieve more than one file from the same directory at
<br>
once, like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wget
ftp://gnjilux.srk.fer.hr/*.msg</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, globbing will be
turned on if the URL contains a globbing character. This
option may be used to turn globbing on or off
permanently.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may have to quote the URL to
protect it from being expanded by your shell. Globbing makes
Wget look for a directory listing, which is system-specific.
This is why it <br>
currently works only with Unix FTP servers (and the ones
emulating Unix &quot;ls&quot; output).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-passive-ftp <br>
Disable the use of the passive FTP transfer mode. Passive
FTP mandates that the client connect to the server to
establish the data connection rather than the other way <br>
around.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the machine is connected to
the Internet directly, both passive and active FTP should
work equally well. Behind most firewall and NAT
configurations passive FTP has a <br>
better chance of working. However, in some rare firewall
configurations, active FTP actually works when passive FTP
doesn&rsquo;t. If you suspect this to be the case, use this
<br>
option, or set &quot;passive_ftp=off&quot; in your init
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--preserve-permissions <br>
Preserve remote file permissions instead of permissions set
by umask.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--retr-symlinks <br>
By default, when retrieving FTP directories recursively and
a symbolic link is encountered, the symbolic link is
traversed and the pointed-to files are retrieved. Currently,
<br>
Wget does not traverse symbolic links to directories to
download them recursively, though this feature may be added
in the future.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When --retr-symlinks=no is
specified, the linked-to file is not downloaded. Instead, a
matching symbolic link is created on the local filesystem.
The pointed-to file will <br>
not be retrieved unless this recursive retrieval would have
encountered it separately and downloaded it anyway. This
option poses a security risk where a malicious FTP <br>
Server may cause Wget to write to files outside of the
intended directories through a specially crafted .LISTING
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that when retrieving a file
(not a directory) because it was specified on the
command-line, rather than because it was recursed to, this
option has no effect. Symbolic <br>
links are always traversed in this case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Recursive Retrieval Options <br>
-r <br>
--recursive <br>
Turn on recursive retrieving. The default maximum depth is
5.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l depth <br>
--level=depth <br>
Specify recursion maximum depth level depth.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--delete-after <br>
This option tells Wget to delete every single file it
downloads, after having done so. It is useful for
pre-fetching popular pages through a proxy, e.g.:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wget -r -nd --delete-after
http://whatever.com/~popular/page/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -r option is to retrieve
recursively, and -nd to not create directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that --delete-after deletes
files on the local machine. It does not issue the DELE
command to remote FTP sites, for instance. Also note that
when --delete-after is <br>
specified, --convert-links is ignored, so .orig files are
simply not created in the first place.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k <br>
--convert-links <br>
After the download is complete, convert the links in the
document to make them suitable for local viewing. This
affects not only the visible hyperlinks, but any part of the
<br>
document that links to external content, such as embedded
images, links to style sheets, hyperlinks to non-HTML
content, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each link will be changed in one
of the two ways:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The links to
files that have been downloaded by Wget will be changed to
refer to the file they point to as a relative link.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example: if the downloaded file
/foo/doc.html links to /bar/img.gif, also downloaded, then
the link in doc.html will be modified to point to
../bar/img.gif. This kind of <br>
transformation works reliably for arbitrary combinations of
directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The links to
files that have not been downloaded by Wget will be changed
to include host name and absolute path of the location they
point to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example: if the downloaded file
/foo/doc.html links to /bar/img.gif (or to ../bar/img.gif),
then the link in doc.html will be modified to point to <br>
http://hostname/bar/img.gif.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Because of this, local browsing
works reliably: if a linked file was downloaded, the link
will refer to its local name; if it was not downloaded, the
link will refer to its <br>
full Internet address rather than presenting a broken link.
The fact that the former links are converted to relative
links ensures that you can move the downloaded hierarchy
<br>
to another directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that only at the end of the
download can Wget know which links have been downloaded.
Because of that, the work done by -k will be performed at
the end of all the <br>
downloads.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-K <br>
--backup-converted <br>
When converting a file, back up the original version with a
.orig suffix. Affects the behavior of -N.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m <br>
--mirror <br>
Turn on options suitable for mirroring. This option turns on
recursion and time-stamping, sets infinite recursion depth
and keeps FTP directory listings. It is currently <br>
equivalent to -r -N -l inf --no-remove-listing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p <br>
--page-requisites <br>
This option causes Wget to download all the files that are
necessary to properly display a given HTML page. This
includes such things as inlined images, sounds, and <br>
referenced stylesheets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ordinarily, when downloading a
single HTML page, any requisite documents that may be needed
to display it properly are not downloaded. Using -r together
with -l can help, <br>
but since Wget does not ordinarily distinguish between
external and inlined documents, one is generally left with
&quot;leaf documents&quot; that are missing their
requisites.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For instance, say document
1.html contains an &quot;&lt;IMG&gt;&quot; tag referencing
1.gif and an &quot;&lt;A&gt;&quot; tag pointing to external
document 2.html. Say that 2.html is similar but that its
<br>
image is 2.gif and it links to 3.html. Say this continues up
to some arbitrarily high number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If one executes the command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wget -r -l 2
http://&lt;site&gt;/1.html</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">then 1.html, 1.gif, 2.html,
2.gif, and 3.html will be downloaded. As you can see, 3.html
is without its requisite 3.gif because Wget is simply
counting the number of hops <br>
(up to 2) away from 1.html in order to determine where to
stop the recursion. However, with this command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wget -r -l 2 -p
http://&lt;site&gt;/1.html</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">all the above files and
3.html&rsquo;s requisite 3.gif will be downloaded.
Similarly,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wget -r -l 1 -p
http://&lt;site&gt;/1.html</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will cause 1.html, 1.gif,
2.html, and 2.gif to be downloaded. One might think
that:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wget -r -l 0 -p
http://&lt;site&gt;/1.html</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">would download just 1.html and
1.gif, but unfortunately this is not the case, because -l 0
is equivalent to -l inf---that is, infinite recursion. To
download a single HTML <br>
page (or a handful of them, all specified on the
command-line or in a -i URL input file) and its (or their)
requisites, simply leave off -r and -l:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wget -p
http://&lt;site&gt;/1.html</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that Wget will behave as if
-r had been specified, but only that single page and its
requisites will be downloaded. Links from that page to
external documents will not <br>
be followed. Actually, to download a single page and all its
requisites (even if they exist on separate websites), and
make sure the lot displays properly locally, this <br>
author likes to use a few options in addition to -p:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wget -E -H -k -K -p
http://&lt;site&gt;/&lt;document&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To finish off this topic,
it&rsquo;s worth knowing that Wget&rsquo;s idea of an
external document link is any URL specified in an
&quot;&lt;A&gt;&quot; tag, an &quot;&lt;AREA&gt;&quot; tag,
or a &quot;&lt;LINK&gt;&quot; tag other than <br>
&quot;&lt;LINK REL=&quot;stylesheet&quot;&gt;&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--strict-comments <br>
Turn on strict parsing of HTML comments. The default is to
terminate comments at the first occurrence of --&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">According to specifications,
HTML comments are expressed as SGML declarations.
Declaration is special markup that begins with &lt;! and
ends with &gt;, such as &lt;!DOCTYPE ...&gt;, <br>
that may contain comments between a pair of -- delimiters.
HTML comments are &quot;empty declarations&quot;, SGML
declarations without any non-comment text. Therefore,
&lt;!--foo--&gt; is <br>
a valid comment, and so is &lt;!--one-- --two--&gt;, but
&lt;!--1--2--&gt; is not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On the other hand, most HTML
writers don&rsquo;t perceive comments as anything other than
text delimited with &lt;!-- and --&gt;, which is not quite
the same. For example, something <br>
like &lt;!------------&gt; works as a valid comment as long
as the number of dashes is a multiple of four (!). If not,
the comment technically lasts until the next --, which may
<br>
be at the other end of the document. Because of this, many
popular browsers completely ignore the specification and
implement what users have come to expect: comments <br>
delimited with &lt;!-- and --&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Until version 1.9, Wget
interpreted comments strictly, which resulted in missing
links in many web pages that displayed fine in browsers, but
had the misfortune of containing <br>
non-compliant comments. Beginning with version 1.9, Wget has
joined the ranks of clients that implements
&quot;naive&quot; comments, terminating each comment at the
first occurrence <br>
of --&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If, for whatever reason, you
want strict comment parsing, use this option to turn it
on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Recursive Accept/Reject Options
<br>
-A acclist --accept acclist <br>
-R rejlist --reject rejlist <br>
Specify comma-separated lists of file name suffixes or
patterns to accept or reject. Note that if any of the
wildcard characters, *, ?, [ or ], appear in an element of
<br>
acclist or rejlist, it will be treated as a pattern, rather
than a suffix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--accept-regex urlregex <br>
--reject-regex urlregex <br>
Specify a regular expression to accept or reject the
complete URL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--regex-type regextype <br>
Specify the regular expression type. Possible types are
posix or pcre. Note that to be able to use pcre type, wget
has to be compiled with libpcre support.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D domain-list <br>
--domains=domain-list <br>
Set domains to be followed. domain-list is a comma-separated
list of domains. Note that it does not turn on -H.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--exclude-domains domain-list
<br>
Specify the domains that are not to be followed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--follow-ftp <br>
Follow FTP links from HTML documents. Without this option,
Wget will ignore all the FTP links.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--follow-tags=list <br>
Wget has an internal table of HTML tag / attribute pairs
that it considers when looking for linked documents during a
recursive retrieval. If a user wants only a subset of <br>
those tags to be considered, however, he or she should be
specify such tags in a comma-separated list with this
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ignore-tags=list <br>
This is the opposite of the --follow-tags option. To skip
certain HTML tags when recursively looking for documents to
download, specify them in a comma-separated list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the past, this option was the
best bet for downloading a single page and its requisites,
using a command-line like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wget --ignore-tags=a,area -H -k
-K -r http://&lt;site&gt;/&lt;document&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, the author of this
option came across a page with tags like &quot;&lt;LINK
REL=&quot;home&quot; HREF=&quot;/&quot;&gt;&quot; and came
to the realization that specifying tags to ignore was not
enough. <br>
One can&rsquo;t just tell Wget to ignore
&quot;&lt;LINK&gt;&quot;, because then stylesheets will not
be downloaded. Now the best bet for downloading a single
page and its requisites is the <br>
dedicated --page-requisites option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ignore-case <br>
Ignore case when matching files and directories. This
influences the behavior of -R, -A, -I, and -X options, as
well as globbing implemented when downloading from FTP
sites. <br>
For example, with this option, -A *.txt will match
file1.txt, but also file2.TXT, file3.TxT, and so on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H <br>
--span-hosts <br>
Enable spanning across hosts when doing recursive
retrieving.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L <br>
--relative <br>
Follow relative links only. Useful for retrieving a specific
home page without any distractions, not even those from the
same hosts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I list <br>
--include-directories=list <br>
Specify a comma-separated list of directories you wish to
follow when downloading. Elements of list may contain
wildcards.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X list <br>
--exclude-directories=list <br>
Specify a comma-separated list of directories you wish to
exclude from download. Elements of list may contain
wildcards.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-np <br>
--no-parent <br>
Do not ever ascend to the parent directory when retrieving
recursively. This is a useful option, since it guarantees
that only the files below a certain hierarchy will be <br>
downloaded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
Wget supports proxies for both HTTP and FTP retrievals. The
standard way to specify proxy location, which Wget
recognizes, is using the following environment
variables:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">http_proxy <br>
https_proxy <br>
If set, the http_proxy and https_proxy variables should
contain the URLs of the proxies for HTTP and HTTPS
connections respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ftp_proxy <br>
This variable should contain the URL of the proxy for FTP
connections. It is quite common that http_proxy and
ftp_proxy are set to the same URL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">no_proxy <br>
This variable should contain a comma-separated list of
domain extensions proxy should not be used for. For
instance, if the value of no_proxy is .mit.edu, proxy will
not be <br>
used to retrieve documents from MIT.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
Wget may return one of several error codes if it encounters
problems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 No problems occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 Generic error code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With the exceptions of 0 and 1,
the lower-numbered exit codes take precedence over
higher-numbered ones, when multiple types of errors are
encountered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In versions of Wget prior to
1.12, Wget&rsquo;s exit status tended to be unhelpful and
inconsistent. Recursive downloads would virtually always
return 0 (success), regardless of any <br>
issues encountered, and non-recursive fetches only returned
the status corresponding to the most recently-attempted
download.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
You are welcome to submit bug reports via the GNU Wget bug
tracker (see
&lt;http://wget.addictivecode.org/BugTracker&gt;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Before actually submitting a bug
report, please try to follow a few simple guidelines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. Please try to ascertain that
the behavior you see really is a bug. If Wget crashes,
it&rsquo;s a bug. If Wget does not behave as documented,
it&rsquo;s a bug. If things work strange, <br>
but you are not sure about the way they are supposed to
work, it might well be a bug, but you might want to
double-check the documentation and the mailing lists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Try to repeat the bug in as
simple circumstances as possible. E.g. if Wget crashes while
downloading wget -rl0 -kKE -t5 --no-proxy
http://yoyodyne.com -o /tmp/log, you <br>
should try to see if the crash is repeatable, and if will
occur with a simpler set of options. You might even try to
start the download at the page where the crash occurred <br>
to see if that page somehow triggered the crash.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also, while I will probably be
interested to know the contents of your .wgetrc file, just
dumping it into the debug message is probably a bad idea.
Instead, you should first <br>
try to see if the bug repeats with .wgetrc moved out of the
way. Only if it turns out that .wgetrc settings affect the
bug, mail me the relevant parts of the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. Please start Wget with -d
option and send us the resulting output (or relevant parts
thereof). If Wget was compiled without debug support,
recompile it---it is much easier <br>
to trace bugs with debug support on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: please make sure to remove
any potentially sensitive information from the debug log
before sending it to the bug address. The &quot;-d&quot;
won&rsquo;t go out of its way to collect <br>
sensitive information, but the log will contain a fairly
complete transcript of Wget&rsquo;s communication with the
server, which may include passwords and pieces of downloaded
<br>
data. Since the bug address is publically archived, you may
assume that all bug reports are visible to the public.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. If Wget has crashed, try to
run it in a debugger, e.g. &quot;gdb &lsquo;which
wget&lsquo; core&quot; and type &quot;where&quot; to get the
backtrace. This may not work if the system administrator has
<br>
disabled core files, but it is safe to try.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
This is not the complete manual for GNU Wget. For more
complete information, including more detailed explanations
of some of the options, and a number of commands available
for <br>
use with .wgetrc files and the -e option, see the GNU Info
entry for wget.</p>
