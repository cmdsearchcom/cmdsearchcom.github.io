<p>JMAKE(1) General Commands Manual JMAKE(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
jmake - a generic makefile builder</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
jmake [ cpp options ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Jmake builds a makefile out of a rather high level
description held in a Jmakefile file. The generated file is
a Makefile.SH rather than a simple makefile, which means it
is <br>
ready to be used in conjonction with metaconfig. In
particular, parameters such as &quot;where to install
executables&quot; will be automatically determined by
Configure and only the <br>
needed parameters will be taken into account.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To use jmake you have to write a
Jmakefile first, which describes the way things are to be
built. Your Jmakefile will be included inside a generic
template through the C pre-pro&acirc; <br>
cessor. This means you may use the usual C /**/ comments,
but not the shell # comments. The C comments will not appear
in the generated Makefile.SH but lines starting with ;# <br>
will finally appear as shell comments. If you have to write
the string /* in the generated Makefile.SH then you have to
escape it (otherwise jmake will think of it as the start
<br>
of a C comment). Simply put a # in front of the *, as in
/#*.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You have a set of macros at your
disposal, and all these macros are listed in the Index file,
along with the piece of code they will expand to. Usually, a
Jmakefile is fairly <br>
small and thus easier to maintain than a huge Makefile. Some
internal powerful commands allow you to write portable
makefiles easily, without having to spend many efforts, <br>
because someone else already did the job for you :-).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When you want to generate your
makefile, you usually do not run jmake but use the jmkmf
script which is a wrapper and will invoke jmake with the
correct options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All the knowledge of jmake is
held in two files: the template Jmake.tmpl and the macro
definition file Jmake.rules. The first file includes the
second, along with the Jmakefile. <br>
It is sometimes necessary to know how things works to be
able to correctly use all the features provided. For
instance, you may have to write your own rules for a
specific <br>
project. Although you cannot overwrite the predefined rules,
you can extent the Jmake.rules file or simply add your
macros in your Jmakefile. You may also use #include
state&acirc; <br>
ments when you want to share these macros and do not want to
duplicate the code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The syntax in Jmake.rules is not
elegant at all, but:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- It is easy to parse (like
sendmail.cf or troff files). <br>
- The rules are not supposed to change very often. <br>
- It is simple enough to be mastered in five minutes.
:-)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here is a small description:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1) To deal with various cpp
implementations:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Final
@!&nbsp;means: end of line, next line starts at the left
margin. <br>
&Acirc;&middot; Final @@&nbsp;means: end of line, next line
is to be indented by one tab.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There should always be one of
@!&nbsp;or @@&nbsp;at the end of each line. The only
exception is for macros that are to be used as part of a
rule body (e.g. RemoveTargetProgram). <br>
In that case, the first line (which holds the #define)
should end with a single backslash.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2) Symbol definitions:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &gt;SYMBOL:
defines the symbol. <br>
&Acirc;&middot; ?SYMBOL:&lt;text&gt;: keeps &lt;text&gt; iff
SYMBOL is defined. <br>
&Acirc;&middot; %SYMBOL:&lt;text&gt;: keeps &lt;text&gt; iff
SYMBOL is not defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ?SYM can be nested (logical
AND), as in:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">?SYMBOL:%TOKEN:text</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">which will keep text if SYMBOL
is defined and TOKEN undefined. To implement a logical OR,
see below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3) Makefile target tests:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
?target?:&lt;text&gt;: keeps &lt;test&gt; iff target is
defined. <br>
&Acirc;&middot; %target%:&lt;text&gt;: keeps &lt;test&gt;
iff target is not defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A makefile target is defined as
a standalone target, for instance the depend.local target,
which would be defined as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">depend.local:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also note that it is only valid
for targets defined so far in the generated makefile. It is
not a predicate that can be used to test for targets that
will eventu&acirc; <br>
ally be defined later on in the generation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4) Commands:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Commands can be passed to jmake.
They start with a leading &rsquo;|&rsquo;. Available
commands are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; |suffix
&lt;sx&gt;: adds &lt;sx&gt; to the .SUFFIXES: list in the
makefile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
|rule:&lt;text&gt;: adds &lt;text&gt; to the building rule
section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; |rule:
&lt;text&gt;: same as before, with a leading tab.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; |skip: skips
text until a line starting with &rsquo;-skip&rsquo; is
found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; |subst: begins
section where lines will be subject to variable
substitution, until &rsquo;-subst&rsquo; is found. This
means that when the Makefile.SH is run, all instances of
<br>
$var within the subst section will be substituted by the
shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; |shell: emits
section until matching &rsquo;-shell&rsquo; as-is in the
generated Makefile.SH. This can be useful to prepare |case
sections. It is not allowed to nest shell <br>
sections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; |case: this
command must be followed by a shell variable name (without
its leading &rsquo;$&rsquo; sign) and a case-style pattern,
for instance the string &quot;var in f*&quot;. It will <br>
generate the corresponding &quot;case&quot; test in the
Makefile.SH on the &quot;$var&quot; value and only if this
test is true will the section until the matching
&rsquo;-case&rsquo; be generated <br>
in the Makefile when Makefile.SH is run. It is possible to
nest case sections freely.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; |expand
&lt;pattern&gt;: expand lines until &rsquo;-expand&rsquo;
with &lt;pattern&gt;. A complete example is shown below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; |once
&lt;symbol&gt;: text up to &rsquo;-once&rsquo; appears only
the first time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &rsquo;|&rsquo; commands
cannot be nested, unless otherwise noted. In particular, due
to the simple implementation of |skip, it is impossible to
put |skip inside a skipped part. <br>
However, a |once section may have |skip sections. It is
allowed to nest |case sections at will.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here is a way to implement a
logical OR:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/* Implements SYMBOL or not
TOKEN */ <br>
?SYMBOL:text /* Keeps text if SYMBOL */ <br>
%SYMBOL:|skip <br>
%TOKEN:text /* Keeps text if not TOKEN */ <br>
-skip</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Actually, this is ugly, because
the text has to appear twice. Fortunately, I did not use
that construct. :-)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Indeed, as you have surely
already guessed, the best way to implement a logical OR is
to use De Morgan&rsquo;s Law:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">not (p or q) &lt;=&gt; not p and
not q</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/* Implements SYMBOL or not
TOKEN (attempt #2) */ <br>
%SYMBOL:?TOKEN:|skip <br>
text /* If SYMBOL or not TOKEN */ <br>
-skip</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Who said they didn&rsquo;t care
about logic? ;-)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Expansion is done with the
expand command. It has been provided to avoid some
cumbersome writings in makefiles when you have to repeat
some silly lines that only differ <br>
in file names, for instance. Let&rsquo;s look at an example
first:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">|expand a!foo bar! b!yes no!
<br>
!a:: <br>
echo !a, !b <br>
-expand</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Then two rules will be printed,
and the values of (a,b) for the first will be (foo, yes),
for the second (bar, no). Substitution is controled by the
&rsquo;!&rsquo; character. If <br>
the word to be substituted is part of another one, detach
with the ^^ construct as in: !b^^c. It is possible to use
Makefile macros in the &lt;pattern&gt;, and they will be
<br>
expanded by jmake. If this is not what you want, escape the
first &rsquo;$&rsquo; sign (this is a Makefile escape, i.e.
you must double the &rsquo;$&rsquo;, not precede it with a
backslash). A <br>
// stands for the null substitution value. <br>
The ^^^ construct behaves like ^^, i.e. it is stripped out,
but it also removes any following white space after the ^^^.
If you prepend something to a macro argument, and <br>
that macro argument was written with spaces before it, then
this will let you concatenate something right before that
argument&rsquo;s final value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here is another example which
shows how the macro Expand can be used. It is defined in
Jmake.rules as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#define Expand(rule, pattern) @!
|expand pattern @! rule @! -expand</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">So we can write in the
Jmakefile:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">|skip <br>
A = foo bar <br>
-skip</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#define Rule @! $(DIR)/!a^^.o:
!a^^.o @@ $(CC) -c !a^^.c @@ $(MV) !a^^.o $(DIR)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Expand(Rule, a!$(A)!)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">which will generate in
Makefile.SH:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$(DIR)/foo.o: foo.o <br>
$(CC) -c foo.c <br>
$(MV) foo.o $(DIR)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$(DIR)/bar.o: bar.o <br>
$(CC) -c bar.c <br>
$(MV) bar.o $$(DIR)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &rsquo;A&rsquo; declaration
has been surrounded by skip, so that it does not appear in
the generated Makefile.SH, but it will be taken into account
by jmake for the substitution <br>
in the pattern.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The number of expansions is
determined by the number of possible values for the first
parameter. If other parameters have less substitution
values, they will get void <br>
ones.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is possible to add a regular
expression at the end of &rsquo;-expand&rsquo;. This regular
expression will be removed from the final set of expansion
at the end of each line. It is <br>
also possible to do substitutions in the expanded item, by
using the syntax (if &rsquo;f&rsquo; is the expanded
variable) !f:&lt;p&gt;=&lt;q&gt; where &lt;p&gt; and
&lt;q&gt; are two regular expressions <br>
(without spaces). The pattern &lt;p&gt; will be replaced by
the pattern &lt;q&gt; (only the first occurrence will be
replaced).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, you may refer in the
expanded section to variables whose value is computed via
another expansion, which makes it easy to define generic
Jmakefiles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SRC = foo.c bar.c <br>
OBJ = |expand f!$(SRC)! <br>
!f:.c=.o -expand \ <br>
INC = |expand f!$(OBJ)! <br>
!f:.o=.h -expand \</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">which will generate in
Makefile.SH:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SRC = foo.c bar.c <br>
OBJ = foo.o bar.o <br>
INC = foo.h bar.h</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Do not forget to protect special
characters in your regular expressions such as backslash,
point, etc...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The once command is tagged with
a name. The first time the name appears, the once construct
is ignored and the text up to &rsquo;-once&rsquo; will be
copied in the generated Make&acirc; <br>
file.SH. However, future occurrences of the same name will
be ignored (once will behave like skip).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">|once this_is_a_name <br>
&lt;text&gt; <br>
-once</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The shell command can be used to
generate a shell fragment in the Makefile.SH. For instance,
the following section in the Jmakefile:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">|shell <br>
case &quot;$d_usegtk1&quot; in <br>
define) glib=1; gtk=1;; <br>
esac <br>
-shell</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will cause the generation of the
enclosed fragment in the Makefile.SH to compute the values
of the glib and gtk variables based on the configuration
variable d_usegtk1 set <br>
by running Configure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In turn, this can be used in
subsequent case sections to activate parts of the Makefile
only when building for GTK1 using glib-1.x:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">|case glib in 1 <br>
display: <br>
echo &quot;Building for glib-1.x&quot; <br>
-case</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This section will generate
something like this in the Makefile.SH:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">!NO!SUBS! <br>
case &quot;$glib&quot; in <br>
1) <br>
$spitshell &gt;&gt;Makefile &lt;&lt;&rsquo;!NO!SUBS!&rsquo;
<br>
display: <br>
echo &quot;Building for glib-1.x&quot; <br>
!NO!SUBS! <br>
;; <br>
esac <br>
$spitshell &gt;&gt;Makefile
&lt;&lt;&rsquo;!NO!SUBS!&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">And when running Makefile.SH,
the &quot;display&quot; rule above will only appear when
building for glib-1.x. The form of the final Makefile can
therefore depend on the configura&acirc; <br>
tion options chosen when Configure was run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5) Initializations:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; +&lt;line&gt;:
Puts the whole line in the initialization section. <br>
&Acirc;&middot; ++SYMBOL &lt;value&gt;: Adds &lt;value&gt;
to the SYMBOL macro.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6) User-defined variables:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The user may define CFLAGS,
LDFLAGS or DPFLAGS as additional flags to be used in C
compilation, linking phase or depend target. It is thus
possible to add some extra flags <br>
such as -I or libraries for Makefiles in specific
sub-directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
On systems whose cpp reduces multiple tabs and spaces to a
single space, jmake attempts to put back any necessary tabs
(which make expects in front of rules) but does not
prop&acirc; <br>
erly formats the body of the rule itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is a bootstraping problem
when creating the first Makefile.SH, because you cannot run
it through a shell until there is a decent Configure script,
but you can&rsquo;t run meta&acirc; <br>
config before there is a Makefile.SH or some needed symbols
will not be defined.</p>
