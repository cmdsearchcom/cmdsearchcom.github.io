<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
ctrans is a metafile translator, taking metafile(s), a
metafile stored in the NCAR Computer Graphics Metafile (CGM)
standard, and interpreting its instructions on the device
<br>
defined by the GRAPHCAP environment variable. Fonts are
stroked according to specifications in the Fontcap file
defined by the FONTCAP environment variable. ctrans utilizes
<br>
Graphcaps by default, see graphcap(5NCARG), while providing
optional processing by user provided libraries, if that is
required by the device or desired by the user. Thus, <br>
ctrans is capable of driving any device for which a Graphcap
is available; with programming modifications, ctrans can
accommodate any device for which an external library of <br>
plotting routines is available. Currently, the following
Graphcap independent devices are supported: X11 under
release 4 and 5, version 11 of X.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ctrans can also translate
metacode into the following raster formats: a60, avs, hdf,
hppcl, nrif, sun and xwd. The device specifier for these
raster formats is the name of the <br>
format. For example &quot;-d xwd&quot; specifies translation
to an xwd formatted raster file. Additionally, a clear text
driver, &quot;-d CTXT&quot;, is available on any terminal.
Not all of the <br>
aforementioned devices may be supported by your particular
configuration of ctrans. For a list of supported devices see
the gcaps(1NCARG) command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ctrans will read from the
standard input if no metafile name is specified or the the
name specified is &lsquo;-&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-bell Ring the bell at the end of each frame. The default is
to run in silent mode. This option is not supported by all
devices.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d device <br>
Device name. ctrans will use the Graphcap (if it exists) or
the appropriate graphics library indicated by device;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If device is preceded by a UNIX
directory path then ctrans will look in that directory for
the specified graphcap. Otherwise ctrans searches the
directory <br>
$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/graphcaps for the graphcap.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For all device specifications
except X11 output is directed to standard out. In the case
of X11 translation results in appropriate calls to the X11
libraries. See graph&acirc; <br>
cap(5NCARG) for a description of supported devices. See
gcaps(1NCARG) for a list of devices supported by your
particular configuration of ctrans.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option overrides the
GRAPHCAP environment variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f fontcap <br>
Fontcap file to be used for stroking text. When interpreting
CGM TEXT command elements use fontcap as the default font
for textual translation. Note: CGMs may contain <br>
textual descriptions which are not embedded in CGM TEXT
elements. Hence they are not influenced by fontcap
specifications. Note also that a CGM may explicitly specify
a <br>
named font which may override a font provided on the command
line. The environment variable FONTCAP may also be used to
specify a default fontcap.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If fontcap is preceded by a UNIX
directory path then ctrans will look in that directory for
the specified fontcap. Otherwise ctrans searches the
directory <br>
$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/fontcaps for the fontcap.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See fontcap(5NCARG) for a
description of the available fontcaps. See fcap(1NCARG) for
a list of the fontcaps installed on your system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option overrides the
FONTCAP environment variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-lmin min <br>
On devices which support line width scaling all lines are
guaranteed to be scaled at least min times the default line
width for that device. This option effectively <br>
insures that the minimum value for the CGM element
&quot;LINE WIDTH&quot; is min.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-lmax max <br>
On devices which support line width scaling all lines are
guaranteed to be scaled at most max times the default line
width for that device. This option effectively insures <br>
that the maximum value for the CGM element &quot;LINE
WIDTH&quot; is max. The results of setting max less then min
are undefined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-lscale scale <br>
On devices which support line width scaling all line width
specifications within the metafile will be scaled by scale.
This option is subject to modification by the -lmin <br>
and -lmax options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-movie time <br>
Set pause to time seconds. In normal operation mode the
translator requires user interaction after the display of
each plot. ctrans will not proceed until the user <br>
responds. If movie mode is set ctrans will wait time seconds
after the display of each frame and then proceed
automatically. This option and the -pause option are
mutu&acirc; <br>
ally exclusive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option may not behave as
expected on slower devices.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-outfile file <br>
Direct translator output to file. By default translator
output is written to the standard output. This option has no
effect for devices of which ctrans has a function- <br>
callable interface. e.g. X11 .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pal pal_fname <br>
Use the color palette defined in the file pal_fname for
subsequent translation of the metafile. This palette will
override any color map defined by the CGM being trans&acirc;
<br>
lated. For a description of the format of pal_fname see
ras_palette(5NCARG).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pause Pause after each frame in
the metafile is displayed and wait for the user to type a
newline before proceding. This option is probably only
useful when used in conjunction <br>
with the -wid option as this is the normal behaviour for
ctrans in most instances. This option and the -movie option
are mutually exclusive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-quiet Suppress reporting of
non-fatal (warning) error messages; only fatal error
messages are reported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-record <br>
&lt; record_number... &gt; <br>
If processing only single frames of the metafile is desired,
this option specifies the record number containing the start
of that frame. ctrans assumes the processing is <br>
to start at the first BEGIN PICTURE element in that record.
The user must perform bookkeeping to determine the record
that contains the desired frame. Normally, a <br>
metafile editor (e.g., ictrans(1NCARG). may be used as the
actual user interface to perform this bookkeeping. Without a
specified record number, ctrans processes the <br>
entire metafile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-soft Unconditionally perform
software filling of all filled polygons. This option may be
useful for devices which do not support the filled polygon
drawing primitive or have <br>
limits on the number of vertices describing a polygon. On
some devices this number is known and software filling is
performed, as appropriate, without user specification.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-verbose <br>
Operate in verbose mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Version <br>
Print the version number and then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-viewport llx:lly:urx:ury <br>
Set the viewport of the output device. The viewport is the
rectangular region of the output device of which the virtual
device coordinate system of the metafile is mapped <br>
onto. Normally this region is the largest device-addressable
square which fits in the center of the device address space.
The -viewport option may be used to change the <br>
default mapping. llx and lly specify the lower left corner
of the device in normalized coordinates. urx and ury specify
the upper right corner of the device in normal&acirc; <br>
ized coordinates. For example, -viewport 0.0 0.0 0.5 0.5,
specifies the lower left corner of the device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-window llx:lly:urx:ury <br>
Specify the workstation window (in the GKS sense). Four
coordinates are specified which define a rectangular window
which is a subset of the normalized VDC rectangle with <br>
corner points (0,0) and (1.0,1.0). llx and lly specify the
lower left corner. urx and .ury specify the upper right
corner. The specified window is mapped onto the <br>
entire display viewport. For example, if the workstation
window is defined by the corner points (0,0) and (0.5 0.5)
then the lower left quarter of a plot would be blown up <br>
to fill the entire viewport. Specification of such a window
can be used for zooming and panning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The range with which one may
zoom in on a plot may be limited by the integer addressing
precision of the device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEVICE-SPECIFIC OPTIONS: <br>
The following options are available when the device is
graphcap-driven (See the gcaps(1NCARG) command for a list of
graphcap-driven devices):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-simulatebg <br>
Simulate CGM background color requests by drawing a large
filled rectangle of the appropriate color. This option is
useful for devices such as color PostScript printers <br>
which have no concept of background color.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options are
available when device is CTXT:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Data Suppress display of CGM
output primitive data. All other CGM element data is
displayed. This may substantially reduce the verbosity of
the clear text driver.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Para Suppress display of CGM
element data except for output primitives. The -Data
combined with the -Para option permit the display of only
the CGM element names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options are
available when device is X11:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-background color <br>
Specifies the default window background color for color
devices. If the metafile explicitly sets color index 0 then
this option is overridden.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-foreground color <br>
Specifies the default foreground color for color devices. If
the metafile explicitly sets color index 1 then this option
is overridden.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-geometry geometry <br>
Specify the size and/or position of the graphics window in
the format of an X11 Window System geometry string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ignorebg <br>
Ignore requests to change the background color. This option
may be useful when ctrans renders into a X window created by
an application other than ctrans. As a side <br>
effect of this option the rendering window is not cleared
between frames.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-reverse <br>
On monochrome devices reverse video is simulated by swapping
the foreground and background colors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-wid window_id <br>
Render into the previously created X window specified by
window_id. Normally ctrans creates its own window for
plotting. The window specified by window_id must be of type
<br>
InputOutput. The window must also have inherited its color
map, depth and visual class from the root window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note also that when this option
is used ctrans cannot receive X events from the drawing
window. Hence, ctrans cannot use &quot;mouse clicks&quot; as
a signal to advance frames. For <br>
this reason the -pause option is useful to prevent ctrans
from processing the entire metafile without pausing between
frames.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">window_id may be specified as a
decimal or hexidecimal integer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options apply to
the X11 color map management of ctrans when device is
X11:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ctrans supports three different
methods of X11 color map management.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the user specifies a shared
color map (using the -scmap option), then ctrans will use
the default X color map for the screen, that is shared by
all applications. If <br>
the metafile contains more colors than there are available
in the default X color map, then a color matching algorithm
is employed. The idea of the algorithm is that the <br>
color in the current color table that is closest to the
requested color will be selected. Closest is defined in
terms of the normal distance metric on the RGB cube. If <br>
the closest color is equal to or farther away than the
percentage error allowed ( -colerr ), then a warning message
will be printed. The closest color is still used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the user specifies a private
color map (using the -pcmap option), then ctrans will create
a private color map for the graphics window. This will
guarantee that 256 <br>
distinct colors are available to the window. This means that
the X window will have a different color map than all the
other windows on the screen. Therefore, you usu&acirc; <br>
ally have to have the mouse pointer in the window for the
correct color table to be installed. One disadvantage to
this option is that there is usually a color flashing <br>
effect on the screen since the wrong color table will be
installed for the other windows on the screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default color map management
scheme attempts to take the best of the two previous models.
It starts out behaving like the shared model, in that it
uses the default <br>
color map for the screen. It differs in that, once it
can&rsquo;t allocate any more colors from the default color
map, in allocates its own private color table and starts
using <br>
it. This way, the color flashing is only present if it
absolutely needs to be so that ctrans can display the
correct color.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-scmap Ask ctrans to use the
shared default X color map only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is the option used if -wid
is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-colerr n <br>
Specifies the percentage color error that is acceptable if
the -scmap option is being used. If the color being used is
n percentage or more different from the color <br>
requested, a warning will be reported by ctrans.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pcmap Ask ctrans to create its
own X color map and use it exclusively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is ignored if the
-wid option is present.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options are
available when device is a60, avs, hdf, hppcl, nrif, sun, or
xwd:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dpi dpi <br>
Specify the number of dots per inch. This option is only
meaningful for the HP LaserJet, hppcl, which ignores the
-resolution option. dpi may be one of 75, 100, 150, or <br>
300. The default is 150.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-direct <br>
By default ctrans outputs raster imagery with 8-bit-indexed
encoding. When this option is used, if the raster file
format supports it, raster imagery is output in a <br>
24-bit-direct encoding scheme. Be warned: the resultant file
is three times the size of its 8-bit-indexed
counterpart.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-landscape <br>
Generate the image in landscape mode. This option is ignored
by all raster devices except the HP LaserJet, hppcl. By
default the LaserJet uses portrait mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-resolution widthxheight <br>
width and height specify the spatial resolution in pixels of
the raster file to be created. The default is 512x512.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
To process a metafile named gmeta and display its contents
on the TEKTRONIX 4107 terminal, use the following call:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% ctrans -d t4107 gmeta</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this device is already
defined by the GRAPHCAP environment variable, simply
call:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% ctrans gmeta</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you wish to display only the
first frame starting in the third record, call:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% ctrans -record 3 -d t4107
gmeta</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To examine the metafile
gmeta&rsquo;s contents without CGM element data being
displayed:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% ctrans -d CTXT -Data -Para
gmeta</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To render the metafile gmeta
(under X Windows) in a window that is 512x512 pixels in
dimension in the lower right corner of your screen</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% ctrans -d X11 -geometry
512x512-0-0 gmeta</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To rasterize the contents of the
metafile gmeta at a resolution of 1024x1024 pixels,
call:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% ctrans -d xwd -res 1024x1024
&gt; raster.xwd</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The raster output is in X11
&quot;xwd&quot; format and is sent to the file
raster.xwd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To zoom in on the upper right
quarter of the metafile gmeta and display it in an X window,
call:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% ctrans -d X11 -window
0.5:0.5:1.0:1.0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
FONTCAP <br>
Default fontcap specifier.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GRAPHCAP <br>
Default output device specifier.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NCARG_ROOT <br>
Path to root of NCAR Graphics installation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NCARG_LIB <br>
If set this variable contains the path to the installed NCAR
Graphics libraries. NCARG_LIB overrides NCARG_ROOT.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NCARG_TMP <br>
If set, this environment variable contains a directory path
to be used for temporary files. On most systems the default
is /tmp. On some systems the default is /usr/tmp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/graphcaps/* <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CAVEATS <br>
Running in &quot;movie&quot; mode may give surprising
results on slower devices, such as dumb terminals. If too
short a time interval is specified slow devices may not have
finished ren&acirc; <br>
dering before the movie timer expires. This results in no
pause between frames.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Metafiles which reference color
table indices that were not previously defined may have
varying results from one device to the next.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using the -wid option to have
ctrans display its output in a window created by another X
application may produce unexpected results, particularly
with regard to color.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At ctrans&rsquo; current level
of implementation, the subset of CGM elements supported is
closely approximated by the list provided in NCAR&rsquo;s
Graphics Installer&rsquo;s Guide, Version 2.00 <br>
(August 1987). However, the best way to determine whether a
particular CGM element is supported by the translator is
feed a metafile containing the element in question to <br>
ctrans. Consult the aforementioned publication for a
discussion of Graphcaps and Fontcaps as well.</p>
