<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
tmux &acirc; terminal multiplexer</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
tmux [-2CluvV] [-c shell-command] [-f file] [-L socket-name]
[-S socket-path] [command [flags]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
tmux is a terminal multiplexer: it enables a number of
terminals to be created, accessed, and controlled from a
single screen. tmux may be detached from a screen and
continue run&acirc; <br>
ning in the background, then later reattached.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When tmux is started it creates
a new session with a single window and displays it on
screen. A status line at the bottom of the screen shows
information on the current session <br>
and is used to enter interactive commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A session is a single collection
of pseudo terminals under the management of tmux. Each
session has one or more windows linked to it. A window
occupies the entire screen and may <br>
be split into rectangular panes, each of which is a separate
pseudo terminal (the pty(4) manual page documents the
technical details of pseudo terminals). Any number of tmux
<br>
instances may connect to the same session, and any number of
windows may be present in the same session. Once all
sessions are killed, tmux exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each session is persistent and
will survive accidental disconnection (such as ssh(1)
connection timeout) or intentional detaching (with the
&acirc;C-b d&acirc; key strokes). tmux may be reat&acirc;
<br>
tached using:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ tmux attach</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In tmux, a session is displayed
on screen by a client and all sessions are managed by a
single server. The server and each client are separate
processes which communicate through <br>
a socket in /tmp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The options are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-2 Force tmux to assume the
terminal supports 256 colours.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C Start in control mode (see
the CONTROL MODE section). Given twice (-CC) disables
echo.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c shell-command <br>
Execute shell-command using the default shell. If necessary,
the tmux server will be started to retrieve the
default-shell option. This option is for compatibility <br>
with sh(1) when tmux is used as a login shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f file Specify an alternative
configuration file. By default, tmux loads the system
configuration file from /etc/tmux.conf, if present, then
looks for a user configuration <br>
file at ~/.tmux.conf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The configuration file is a set
of tmux commands which are executed in sequence when the
server is first started. tmux loads configuration files once
when the server <br>
process has started. The source-file command may be used to
load a file later.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tmux shows any error messages
from commands in configuration files in the first session
created, and continues to process the rest of the
configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L socket-name <br>
tmux stores the server socket in a directory under
TMUX_TMPDIR or /tmp if it is unset. The default socket is
named default. This option allows a different socket <br>
name to be specified, allowing several independent tmux
servers to be run. Unlike -S a full path is not necessary:
the sockets are all created in the same directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the socket is accidentally
removed, the SIGUSR1 signal may be sent to the tmux server
process to recreate it (note that this will fail if any
parent directories <br>
are missing).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l Behave as a login shell. This
flag currently has no effect and is for compatibility with
other shells when using tmux as a login shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S socket-path <br>
Specify a full alternative path to the server socket. If -S
is specified, the default socket directory is not used and
any -L flag is ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u tmux attempts to guess if the
terminal is likely to support UTF-8 by checking the first of
the LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE and LANG environment variables to be
set for the <br>
string &quot;UTF-8&quot;. This is not always correct: the -u
flag explicitly informs tmux that UTF-8 is supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that tmux itself always
accepts UTF-8; this controls whether it will send UTF-8
characters to the terminal it is running (if not, they are
replaced by &acirc;_&acirc;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Request verbose logging. This
option may be specified multiple times for increasing
verbosity. Log messages will be saved into
tmux-client-PID.log and <br>
tmux-server-PID.log files in the current directory, where
PID is the PID of the server or client process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Report the tmux version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">command [flags] <br>
This specifies one of a set of commands used to control
tmux, as described in the following sections. If no commands
are specified, the new-session command is <br>
assumed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KEY BINDINGS <br>
tmux may be controlled from an attached client by using a
key combination of a prefix key, &acirc;C-b&acirc; (Ctrl-b)
by default, followed by a command key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default command key bindings
are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C-b Send the prefix key (C-b)
through to the application. <br>
C-o Rotate the panes in the current window forwards. <br>
C-z Suspend the tmux client. <br>

even-horizontal, even-vertical, main-horizontal,
main-vertical, or tiled. <br>
Space Arrange the current window in the next preset layout.
<br>
M-n Move to the next window with a bell or activity marker.
<br>

M-Up, M-Down <br>
M-Left, M-Right <br>
Resize the current pane in steps of five cells.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Key bindings may be changed with
the bind-key and unbind-key commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMANDS <br>
This section contains a list of the commands supported by
tmux. Most commands accept the optional -t (and sometimes
-s) argument with one of target-client, target-session <br>
target-window, or target-pane. These specify the client,
session, window or pane which a command should affect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">target-client is the name of the
pty(4) file to which the client is connected, for example
either of /dev/ttyp1 or ttyp1 for the client attached to
/dev/ttyp1. If no client is <br>
specified, tmux attempts to work out the client currently in
use; if that fails, an error is reported. Clients may be
listed with the list-clients command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">target-session is tried as, in
order:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. A session ID prefixed with a
$.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. An exact name of a session
(as listed by the list-sessions command).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. The start of a session name,
for example &acirc;mysess&acirc; would match a session named
&acirc;mysession&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. An fnmatch(3) pattern which
is matched against the session name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the session name is prefixed
with an &acirc;=&acirc;, only an exact match is accepted (so
&acirc;=mysess&acirc; will only match exactly
&acirc;mysess&acirc;, not &acirc;mysession&acirc;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a single session is found, it
is used as the target session; multiple matches produce an
error. If a session is omitted, the current session is used
if available; if no current <br>
session is available, the most recently used is chosen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">target-window (or src-window or
dst-window) specifies a window in the form session:window.
session follows the same rules as for target-session, and
window is looked for in order <br>
as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. A special token, listed
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. A window index, for example
&acirc;mysession:1&acirc; is window 1 in session
&acirc;mysession&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. A window ID, such as @1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. An exact window name, such as
&acirc;mysession:mywindow&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5. The start of a window name,
such as &acirc;mysession:mywin&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6. As an fnmatch(3) pattern
matched against the window name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Like sessions, a &acirc;=&acirc;
prefix will do an exact match only. An empty window name
specifies the next unused index if appropriate (for example
the new-window and link-window commands) <br>
otherwise the current window in session is chosen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following special tokens are
available to indicate particular windows. Each has a
single-character alternative form.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Token Meaning <br>
{start} ^ The lowest-numbered window <br>
{end} $ The highest-numbered window <br>
{last} ! The last (previously current) window <br>
{next} + The next window by number <br>
{previous} - The previous window by number</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">target-pane (or src-pane or
dst-pane) may be a pane ID or takes a similar form to
target-window but with the optional addition of a period
followed by a pane index or pane ID, for <br>
example: &acirc;mysession:mywindow.1&acirc;. If the pane
index is omitted, the currently active pane in the specified
window is used. The following special tokens are available
for the pane <br>
index:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Token Meaning <br>
{last} ! The last (previously active) pane <br>
{next} + The next pane by number <br>
{previous} - The previous pane by number <br>
{top} The top pane <br>
{bottom} The bottom pane <br>
{left} The leftmost pane <br>
{right} The rightmost pane <br>
{top-left} The top-left pane <br>
{top-right} The top-right pane <br>
{bottom-left} The bottom-left pane <br>
{bottom-right} The bottom-right pane <br>
{up-of} The pane above the active pane <br>
{down-of} The pane below the active pane <br>
{left-of} The pane to the left of the active pane <br>
{right-of} The pane to the right of the active pane</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The tokens &acirc;+&acirc; and
&acirc;-&acirc; may be followed by an offset, for
example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">select-window -t:+2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition, target-session,
target-window or target-pane may consist entirely of the
token &acirc;{mouse}&acirc; (alternative form
&acirc;=&acirc;) to specify the most recent mouse event (see
the MOUSE <br>
SUPPORT section) or &acirc;{marked}&acirc; (alternative form
&acirc;~&acirc;) to specify the marked pane (see select-pane
-m).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sessions, window and panes are
each numbered with a unique ID; session IDs are prefixed
with a &acirc;$&acirc;, windows with a &acirc;@&acirc;, and
panes with a &acirc;%&acirc;. These are unique and are
unchanged <br>
for the life of the session, window or pane in the tmux
server. The pane ID is passed to the child process of the
pane in the TMUX_PANE environment variable. IDs may be
displayed <br>
using the &acirc;session_id&acirc;, &acirc;window_id&acirc;,
or &acirc;pane_id&acirc; formats (see the FORMATS section)
and the display-message, list-sessions, list-windows or
list-panes commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">shell-command arguments are
sh(1) commands. This may be a single argument passed to the
shell, for example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">new-window &rsquo;vi
/etc/passwd&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Will run:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/bin/sh -c &rsquo;vi
/etc/passwd&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Additionally, the new-window,
new-session, split-window, respawn-window and respawn-pane
commands allow shell-command to be given as multiple
arguments and executed directly (with&acirc; <br>
out &acirc;sh -c&acirc;). This can avoid issues with shell
quoting. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ tmux new-window vi
/etc/passwd</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Will run vi(1) directly without
invoking the shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">command [arguments] refers to a
tmux command, passed with the command and arguments
separately, for example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bind-key F1 set-window-option
force-width 81</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Or if using sh(1):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ tmux bind-key F1
set-window-option force-width 81</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Multiple commands may be
specified together as part of a command sequence. Each
command should be separated by spaces and a semicolon;
commands are executed sequentially from left <br>
to right and lines ending with a backslash continue on to
the next line, except when escaped by another backslash. A
literal semicolon may be included by escaping it with a
back&acirc; <br>
slash (for example, when specifying a command sequence to
bind-key).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example tmux commands
include:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">refresh-client -t/dev/ttyp2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rename-session -tfirst
newname</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set-window-option -t:0
monitor-activity on</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">new-window ; split-window -d</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bind-key R source-file
~/.tmux.conf ; display-message &quot;source-file
done&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Or from sh(1):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ tmux kill-window -t :1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ tmux new-window ; split-window
-d</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ tmux new-session -d &rsquo;vi
/etc/passwd&rsquo; ; split-window -d ; attach</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CLIENTS AND SESSIONS <br>
The tmux server manages clients, sessions, windows and
panes. Clients are attached to sessions to interact with
them, either when they are created with the new-session
command, or <br>
later with the attach-session command. Each session has one
or more windows linked into it. Windows may be linked to
multiple sessions and are made up of one or more panes, each
<br>
of which contains a pseudo terminal. Commands for creating,
linking and otherwise manipulating windows are covered in
the WINDOWS AND PANES section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following commands are
available to manage clients and sessions:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">attach-session [-dEr] [-c
working-directory] [-t target-session] <br>
(alias: attach) <br>
If run from outside tmux, create a new client in the current
terminal and attach it to target-session. If used from
inside, switch the current client. If -d is specified, <br>
any other clients attached to the session are detached. -r
signifies the client is read-only (only keys bound to the
detach-client or switch-client commands have any <br>
effect)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no server is started,
attach-session will attempt to start it; this will fail
unless sessions are created in the configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The target-session rules for
attach-session are slightly adjusted: if tmux needs to
select the most recently used session, it will prefer the
most recently used unattached <br>
session.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c will set the session working
directory (used for new windows) to working-directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If -E is used, the
update-environment option will not be applied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">detach-client [-aP] [-s
target-session] [-t target-client] <br>
(alias: detach) <br>
Detach the current client if bound to a key, the client
specified with -t, or all clients currently attached to the
session specified by -s. The -a option kills all but <br>
the client given with -t. If -P is given, send SIGHUP to the
parent process of the client, typically causing it to
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">has-session [-t target-session]
<br>
(alias: has) <br>
Report an error and exit with 1 if the specified session
does not exist. If it does exist, exit with 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kill-server <br>
Kill the tmux server and clients and destroy all
sessions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kill-session [-aC] [-t
target-session] <br>
Destroy the given session, closing any windows linked to it
and no other sessions, and detaching all clients attached to
it. If -a is given, all sessions but the specified <br>
one is killed. The -C flag clears alerts (bell, activity, or
silence) in all windows linked to the session.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list-clients [-F format] [-t
target-session] <br>
(alias: lsc) <br>
List all clients attached to the server. For the meaning of
the -F flag, see the FORMATS section. If target-session is
specified, list only clients connected to that ses&acirc;
<br>
sion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list-commands <br>
(alias: lscm) <br>
List the syntax of all commands supported by tmux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list-sessions [-F format] <br>
(alias: ls) <br>
List all sessions managed by the server. For the meaning of
the -F flag, see the FORMATS section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lock-client [-t target-client]
<br>
(alias: lockc) <br>
Lock target-client, see the lock-server command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lock-session [-t target-session]
<br>
(alias: locks) <br>
Lock all clients attached to target-session.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">new-session [-AdDEP] [-c
start-directory] [-F format] [-n window-name] [-s
session-name] [-t target-session] [-x width] [-y height]
[shell-command] <br>
(alias: new) <br>
Create a new session with name session-name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The new session is attached to
the current terminal unless -d is given. window-name and
shell-command are the name of and shell command to execute
in the initial window. <br>
If -d is used, -x and -y specify the size of the initial
window (80 by 24 if not given).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If run from a terminal, any
termios(4) special characters are saved and used for new
windows in the new session.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -A flag makes new-session
behave like attach-session if session-name already exists;
in this case, -D behaves like -d to attach-session.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If -t is given, the new session
is grouped with target-session. This means they share the
same set of windows - all windows from target-session are
linked to the new ses&acirc; <br>
sion, any new windows are linked to both sessions and any
windows closed removed from both sessions. The current and
previous window and any session options remain inde&acirc;
<br>
pendent and either session may be killed without affecting
the other. -n and shell-command are invalid if -t is
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -P option prints information
about the new session after it has been created. By default,
it uses the format &acirc;#{session_name}:&acirc; but a
different format may be specified <br>
with -F.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If -E is used, the
update-environment option will not be applied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">refresh-client [-S] [-t
target-client] <br>
(alias: refresh) <br>
Refresh the current client if bound to a key, or a single
client if one is given with -t. If -S is specified, only
update the client&rsquo;s status bar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rename-session [-t
target-session] new-name <br>
(alias: rename) <br>
Rename the session to new-name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">show-messages [-JT] [-t
target-client] <br>
(alias: showmsgs) <br>
Show client messages or server information. Any messages
displayed on the status line are saved in a per-client
message log, up to a maximum of the limit set by the <br>
message-limit server option. With -t, display the log for
target-client. -J and -T show debugging information about
jobs and terminals.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">source-file path <br>
(alias: source) <br>
Execute commands from path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">start-server <br>
(alias: start) <br>
Start the tmux server, if not already running, without
creating any sessions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">suspend-client [-t
target-client] <br>
(alias: suspendc) <br>
Suspend a client by sending SIGTSTP (tty stop).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">switch-client [-Elnpr] [-c
target-client] [-t target-session] [-T key-table] <br>
(alias: switchc) <br>
Switch the current session for client target-client to
target-session. If -l, -n or -p is used, the client is moved
to the last, next or previous session respectively. -r <br>
toggles whether a client is read-only (see the
attach-session command).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If -E is used,
update-environment option will not be applied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T sets the client&rsquo;s key
table; the next key from the client will be interpreted from
key-table. This may be used to configure multiple prefix
keys, or to bind commands to <br>
sequences of keys. For example, to make typing
&acirc;abc&acirc; run the list-keys command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bind-key -Ttable2 c list-keys
<br>
bind-key -Ttable1 b switch-client -Ttable2 <br>
bind-key -Troot a switch-client -Ttable1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WINDOWS AND PANES <br>
A tmux window may be in one of several modes. The default
permits direct access to the terminal attached to the
window. The other is copy mode, which permits a section of a
win&acirc; <br>
dow or its history to be copied to a paste buffer for later
insertion into another window. This mode is entered with the
copy-mode command, bound to &acirc;[&acirc; by default. It
is also <br>
entered when a command that produces output, such as
list-keys, is executed from a key binding.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The keys available depend on
whether emacs or vi mode is selected (see the mode-keys
option). The following keys are supported as appropriate for
the mode:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The next and previous word keys
use space and the &acirc;-&acirc;, &acirc;_&acirc; and
&acirc;@&acirc; characters as word delimiters by default,
but this can be adjusted by setting the word-separators
session option. <br>
Next word moves to the start of the next word, next word end
to the end of the next word and previous word to the start
of the previous word. The three next and previous space <br>
keys work similarly but use a space alone as the word
separator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The jump commands enable quick
movement within a line. For instance, typing &acirc;f&acirc;
followed by &acirc;/&acirc; will move the cursor to the next
&acirc;/&acirc; character on the current line. A
&acirc;;&acirc; will <br>
then jump to the next occurrence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Commands in copy mode may be
prefaced by an optional repeat count. With vi key bindings,
a prefix is entered using the number keys; with emacs, the
Alt (meta) key and a number <br>
begins prefix entry. For example, to move the cursor forward
by ten words, use &acirc;M-1 0 M-f&acirc; in emacs mode, and
&acirc;10w&acirc; in vi.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mode key bindings are defined in
a set of named tables: vi-edit and emacs-edit for keys used
when line editing at the command prompt; vi-choice and
emacs-choice for keys used when <br>
choosing from lists (such as produced by the choose-window
command); and vi-copy and emacs-copy used in copy mode. The
tables may be viewed with the list-keys command and keys
<br>
modified or removed with bind-key and unbind-key. If
append-selection, copy-selection, or start-named-buffer are
given the -x flag, tmux will not exit copy mode after
copying. <br>
copy-pipe copies the selection and pipes it to a command.
For example the following will bind &acirc;C-w&acirc; not to
exit after copying and &acirc;C-q&acirc; to copy the
selection into /tmp as well as <br>
the paste buffer:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bind-key -temacs-copy C-w
copy-selection -x <br>
bind-key -temacs-copy C-q copy-pipe &quot;cat
&gt;/tmp/out&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The paste buffer key pastes the
first line from the top paste buffer on the stack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The synopsis for the copy-mode
command is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">copy-mode [-Meu] [-t
target-pane] <br>
Enter copy mode. The -u option scrolls one page up. -M
begins a mouse drag (only valid if bound to a mouse key
binding, see MOUSE SUPPORT). -e specifies that scrolling
<br>
to the bottom of the history (to the visible screen) should
exit copy mode. While in copy mode, pressing a key other
than those used for scrolling will disable this behav&acirc;
<br>
iour. This is intended to allow fast scrolling through a
pane&rsquo;s history, for example with:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bind PageUp copy-mode -eu</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each window displayed by tmux
may be split into one or more panes; each pane takes up a
certain area of the display and is a separate terminal. A
window may be split into panes <br>
using the split-window command. Windows may be split
horizontally (with the -h flag) or vertically. Panes may be
resized with the resize-pane command (bound to
&acirc;C-up&acirc;, &acirc;C-down&acirc; <br>
&acirc;C-left&acirc; and &acirc;C-right&acirc; by default),
the current pane may be changed with the select-pane command
and the rotate-window and swap-pane commands may be used to
swap panes without <br>
changing their position. Panes are numbered beginning from
zero in the order they are created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A number of preset layouts are
available. These may be selected with the select-layout
command or cycled with next-layout (bound to
&acirc;Space&acirc; by default); once a layout is chosen,
<br>
panes within it may be moved and resized as normal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following layouts are
supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">even-horizontal <br>
Panes are spread out evenly from left to right across the
window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">even-vertical <br>
Panes are spread evenly from top to bottom.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">main-horizontal <br>
A large (main) pane is shown at the top of the window and
the remaining panes are spread from left to right in the
leftover space at the bottom. Use the main-pane-height <br>
window option to specify the height of the top pane.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">main-vertical <br>
Similar to main-horizontal but the large pane is placed on
the left and the others spread from top to bottom along the
right. See the main-pane-width window option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tiled Panes are spread out as
evenly as possible over the window in both rows and
columns.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition, select-layout may
be used to apply a previously used layout - the list-windows
command displays the layout of each window in a form
suitable for use with <br>
select-layout. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ tmux list-windows <br>
0: ksh [159x48] <br>
layout: bb62,159x48,0,0{79x48,0,0,79x48,80,0} <br>
$ tmux select-layout
bb62,159x48,0,0{79x48,0,0,79x48,80,0}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tmux automatically adjusts the
size of the layout for the current window size. Note that a
layout cannot be applied to a window with more panes than
that from which the layout was <br>
originally defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Commands related to windows and
panes are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">break-pane [-dP] [-F format] [-s
src-pane] [-t dst-window] <br>
(alias: breakp) <br>
Break src-pane off from its containing window to make it the
only pane in dst-window. If -d is given, the new window does
not become the current window. The -P option <br>
prints information about the new window after it has been
created. By default, it uses the format
&acirc;#{session_name}:#{window_index}&acirc; but a
different format may be specified <br>
with -F.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">capture-pane [-aepPq] [-b
buffer-name] [-E end-line] [-S start-line] [-t target-pane]
<br>
(alias: capturep) <br>
Capture the contents of a pane. If -p is given, the output
goes to stdout, otherwise to the buffer specified with -b or
a new buffer if omitted. If -a is given, the <br>
alternate screen is used, and the history is not accessible.
If no alternate screen exists, an error will be returned
unless -q is given. If -e is given, the output <br>
includes escape sequences for text and background
attributes. -C also escapes non-printable characters as
octal . -J joins wrapped lines and preserves trailing spaces
<br>
at each line&rsquo;s end. -P captures only any output that
the pane has received that is the beginning of an as-yet
incomplete escape sequence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S and -E specify the starting
and ending line numbers, zero is the first line of the
visible pane and negative numbers are lines in the history.
&acirc;-&acirc; to -S is the start of <br>
the history and to -E the end of the visible pane. The
default is to capture only the visible contents of the
pane.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">choose-client [-F format] [-t
target-window] [template] <br>
Put a window into client choice mode, allowing a client to
be selected interactively from a list. After a client is
chosen, &acirc;%%&acirc; is replaced by the client pty(4)
path in <br>
template and the result executed as a command. If template
is not given, &quot;detach-client -t &rsquo;%%&rsquo;&quot;
is used. For the meaning of the -F flag, see the FORMATS
section. This <br>
command works only if at least one client is attached.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">choose-session [-F format] [-t
target-window] [template] <br>
Put a window into session choice mode, where a session may
be selected interactively from a list. When one is chosen,
&acirc;%%&acirc; is replaced by the session name in template
and <br>
the result executed as a command. If template is not given,
&quot;switch-client -t &rsquo;%%&rsquo;&quot; is used. For
the meaning of the -F flag, see the FORMATS section. This
command works <br>
only if at least one client is attached.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">choose-tree [-suw] [-b
session-template] [-c window-template] [-S format] [-W
format] [-t target-window] <br>
Put a window into tree choice mode, where either sessions or
windows may be selected interactively from a list. By
default, windows belonging to a session are indented to <br>
show their relationship to a session.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the choose-window and
choose-session commands are wrappers around choose-tree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If -s is given, will show
sessions. If -w is given, will show windows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, the tree is
collapsed and sessions must be expanded to windows with the
right arrow key. The -u option will start with all sessions
expanded instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If -b is given, will override
the default session command. Note that &acirc;%%&acirc; can
be used and will be replaced with the session name. The
default option if not specified is <br>
&quot;switch-client -t &rsquo;%%&rsquo;&quot;. If -c is
given, will override the default window command. Like -b,
&acirc;%%&acirc; can be used and will be replaced with the
session name and window index. <br>
When a window is chosen from the list, the session command
is run before the window command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If -S is given will display the
specified format instead of the default session format. If
-W is given will display the specified format instead of the
default window for&acirc; <br>
mat. For the meaning of the -s and -w options, see the
FORMATS section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command works only if at
least one client is attached.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">choose-window [-F format] [-t
target-window] [template] <br>
Put a window into window choice mode, where a window may be
chosen interactively from a list. After a window is
selected, &acirc;%%&acirc; is replaced by the session name
and window <br>
index in template and the result executed as a command. If
template is not given, &quot;select-window -t
&rsquo;%%&rsquo;&quot; is used. For the meaning of the -F
flag, see the FORMATS sec&acirc; <br>
tion. This command works only if at least one client is
attached.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">display-panes [-t target-client]
<br>
(alias: displayp) <br>
Display a visible indicator of each pane shown by
target-client. See the display-panes-time,
display-panes-colour, and display-panes-active-colour
session options. While <br>
the indicator is on screen, a pane may be selected with the
&acirc;0&acirc; to &acirc;9&acirc; keys.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">find-window [-CNT] [-F format]
[-t target-window] match-string <br>
(alias: findw) <br>
Search for the fnmatch(3) pattern match-string in window
names, titles, and visible content (but not history). The
flags control matching behavior: -C matches only visible
<br>
window contents, -N matches only the window name and -T
matches only the window title. The default is -CNT. If only
one window is matched, it&rsquo;ll be automatically <br>
selected, otherwise a choice list is shown. For the meaning
of the -F flag, see the FORMATS section. This command works
only if at least one client is attached.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">join-pane [-bdhv] [-l size | -p
percentage] [-s src-pane] [-t dst-pane] <br>
(alias: joinp) <br>
Like split-window, but instead of splitting dst-pane and
creating a new pane, split it and move src-pane into the
space. This can be used to reverse break-pane. The -b <br>
option causes src-pane to be joined to left of or above
dst-pane.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If -s is omitted and a marked
pane is present (see select-pane -m), the marked pane is
used rather than the current pane.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kill-pane [-a] [-t target-pane]
<br>
(alias: killp) <br>
Destroy the given pane. If no panes remain in the containing
window, it is also destroyed. The -a option kills all but
the pane given with -t.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kill-window [-a] [-t
target-window] <br>
(alias: killw) <br>
Kill the current window or the window at target-window,
removing it from any sessions to which it is linked. The -a
option kills all but the window given with -t.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">last-pane [-de] [-t
target-window] <br>
(alias: lastp) <br>
Select the last (previously selected) pane. -e enables or -d
disables input to the pane.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">last-window [-t target-session]
<br>
(alias: last) <br>
Select the last (previously selected) window. If no
target-session is specified, select the last window of the
current session.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">link-window [-adk] [-s
src-window] [-t dst-window] <br>
(alias: linkw) <br>
Link the window at src-window to the specified dst-window.
If dst-window is specified and no such window exists, the
src-window is linked there. With -a, the window is <br>
moved to the next index up (following windows are moved if
necessary). If -k is given and dst-window exists, it is
killed, otherwise an error is generated. If -d is <br>
given, the newly linked window is not selected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list-panes [-as] [-F format] [-t
target] <br>
(alias: lsp) <br>
If -a is given, target is ignored and all panes on the
server are listed. If -s is given, target is a session (or
the current session). If neither is given, target is a <br>
window (or the current window). For the meaning of the -F
flag, see the FORMATS section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list-windows [-a] [-F format]
[-t target-session] <br>
(alias: lsw) <br>
If -a is given, list all windows on the server. Otherwise,
list windows in the current session or in target-session.
For the meaning of the -F flag, see the FORMATS sec&acirc;
<br>
tion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">move-pane [-bdhv] [-l size | -p
percentage] [-s src-pane] [-t dst-pane] <br>
(alias: movep) <br>
Like join-pane, but src-pane and dst-pane may belong to the
same window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">move-window [-ardk] [-s
src-window] [-t dst-window] <br>
(alias: movew) <br>
This is similar to link-window, except the window at
src-window is moved to dst-window. With -r, all windows in
the session are renumbered in sequential order, respecting
<br>
the base-index option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">new-window [-adkP] [-c
start-directory] [-F format] [-n window-name] [-t
target-window] [shell-command] <br>
(alias: neww) <br>
Create a new window. With -a, the new window is inserted at
the next index up from the specified target-window, moving
windows up if necessary, otherwise target-window is <br>
the new window location.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If -d is given, the session does
not make the new window the current window. target-window
represents the window to be created; if the target already
exists an error is <br>
shown, unless the -k flag is used, in which case it is
destroyed. shell-command is the command to execute. If
shell-command is not specified, the value of the <br>
default-command option is used. -c specifies the working
directory in which the new window is created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the shell command
completes, the window closes. See the remain-on-exit option
to change this behaviour.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The TERM environment variable
must be set to &acirc;screen&acirc; for all programs running
inside tmux. New windows will automatically have
&acirc;TERM=screen&acirc; added to their environment, <br>
but care must be taken not to reset this in shell start-up
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -P option prints information
about the new window after it has been created. By default,
it uses the format
&acirc;#{session_name}:#{window_index}&acirc; but a
different format <br>
may be specified with -F.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">next-layout [-t target-window]
<br>
(alias: nextl) <br>
Move a window to the next layout and rearrange the panes to
fit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">next-window [-a] [-t
target-session] <br>
(alias: next) <br>
Move to the next window in the session. If -a is used, move
to the next window with an alert.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pipe-pane [-o] [-t target-pane]
[shell-command] <br>
(alias: pipep) <br>
Pipe any output sent by the program in target-pane to a
shell command. A pane may only be piped to one command at a
time, any existing pipe is closed before shell-command <br>
is executed. The shell-command string may contain the
special character sequences supported by the status-left
option. If no shell-command is given, the current pipe (if
<br>
any) is closed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -o option only opens a new
pipe if no previous pipe exists, allowing a pipe to be
toggled with a single key, for example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bind-key C-p pipe-pane -o
&rsquo;cat &gt;&gt;~/output.#I-#P&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">previous-layout [-t
target-window] <br>
(alias: prevl) <br>
Move to the previous layout in the session.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">previous-window [-a] [-t
target-session] <br>
(alias: prev) <br>
Move to the previous window in the session. With -a, move to
the previous window with an alert.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rename-window [-t target-window]
new-name <br>
(alias: renamew) <br>
Rename the current window, or the window at target-window if
specified, to new-name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">resize-pane [-DLMRUZ] [-t
target-pane] [-x width] [-y height] [adjustment] <br>
(alias: resizep) <br>
Resize a pane, up, down, left or right by adjustment with
-U, -D, -L or -R, or to an absolute size with -x or -y. The
adjustment is given in lines or cells (the default is <br>
1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With -Z, the active pane is
toggled between zoomed (occupying the whole of the window)
and unzoomed (its normal position in the layout).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M begins mouse resizing (only
valid if bound to a mouse key binding, see MOUSE
SUPPORT).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">respawn-pane [-k] [-t
target-pane] [shell-command] <br>
(alias: respawnp) <br>
Reactivate a pane in which the command has exited (see the
remain-on-exit window option). If shell-command is not
given, the command used when the pane was created is
exe&acirc; <br>
cuted. The pane must be already inactive, unless -k is
given, in which case any existing command is killed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">respawn-window [-k] [-t
target-window] [shell-command] <br>
(alias: respawnw) <br>
Reactivate a window in which the command has exited (see the
remain-on-exit window option). If shell-command is not
given, the command used when the window was created is <br>
executed. The window must be already inactive, unless -k is
given, in which case any existing command is killed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rotate-window [-DU] [-t
target-window] <br>
(alias: rotatew) <br>
Rotate the positions of the panes within a window, either
upward (numerically lower) with -U or downward (numerically
higher).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">select-layout [-nop] [-t
target-window] [layout-name] <br>
(alias: selectl) <br>
Choose a specific layout for a window. If layout-name is not
given, the last preset layout used (if any) is reapplied. -n
and -p are equivalent to the next-layout and <br>
previous-layout commands. -o applies the last set layout if
possible (undoes the most recent layout change).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">select-pane [-DdegLlMmRU] [-P
style] [-t target-pane] <br>
(alias: selectp) <br>
Make pane target-pane the active pane in window
target-window, or set its style (with -P). If one of -D, -L,
-R, or -U is used, respectively the pane below, to the left,
<br>
to the right, or above the target pane is used. -l is the
same as using the last-pane command. -e enables or -d
disables input to the pane.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m and -M are used to set and
clear the marked pane. There is one marked pane at a time,
setting a new marked pane clears the last. The marked pane
is the default target <br>
for -s to join-pane, swap-pane and swap-window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each pane has a style: by
default the window-style and window-active-style options are
used, select-pane -P sets the style for a single pane. For
example, to set the pane <br>
1 background to red:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">select-pane -t:.1 -P
&rsquo;bg=red&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g shows the current pane
style.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">select-window [-lnpT] [-t
target-window] <br>
(alias: selectw) <br>
Select the window at target-window. -l, -n and -p are
equivalent to the last-window, next-window and
previous-window commands. If -T is given and the selected
window is <br>
already the current window, the command behaves like
last-window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">split-window [-bdhvP] [-c
start-directory] [-l size | -p percentage] [-t target-pane]
[shell-command] [-F format] <br>
(alias: splitw) <br>
Create a new pane by splitting target-pane: -h does a
horizontal split and -v a vertical split; if neither is
specified, -v is assumed. The -l and -p options specify the
<br>
size of the new pane in lines (for vertical split) or in
cells (for horizontal split), or as a percentage,
respectively. The -b option causes the new pane to be
created to <br>
the left of or above target-pane. All other options have the
same meaning as for the new-window command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">swap-pane [-dDU] [-s src-pane]
[-t dst-pane] <br>
(alias: swapp) <br>
Swap two panes. If -U is used and no source pane is
specified with -s, dst-pane is swapped with the previous
pane (before it numerically); -D swaps with the next pane
<br>
(after it numerically). -d instructs tmux not to change the
active pane.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If -s is omitted and a marked
pane is present (see select-pane -m), the marked pane is
used rather than the current pane.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">swap-window [-d] [-s src-window]
[-t dst-window] <br>
(alias: swapw) <br>
This is similar to link-window, except the source and
destination windows are swapped. It is an error if no window
exists at src-window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Like swap-pane, if -s is omitted
and a marked pane is present (see select-pane -m), the
window containing the marked pane is used rather than the
current window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unlink-window [-k] [-t
target-window] <br>
(alias: unlinkw) <br>
Unlink target-window. Unless -k is given, a window may be
unlinked only if it is linked to multiple sessions - windows
may not be linked to no sessions; if -k is specified <br>
and the window is linked to only one session, it is unlinked
and destroyed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KEY BINDINGS <br>
tmux allows a command to be bound to most keys, with or
without a prefix key. When specifying keys, most represent
themselves (for example &acirc;A&acirc; to &acirc;Z&acirc;).
Ctrl keys may be prefixed <br>
with &acirc;C-&acirc; or &acirc;^&acirc;, and Alt (meta)
with &acirc;M-&acirc;. In addition, the following special
key names are accepted: Up, Down, Left, Right, BSpace, BTab,
DC (Delete), End, Enter, Escape, F1 to <br>
F12, Home, IC (Insert), NPage/PageDown/PgDn,
PPage/PageUp/PgUp, Space, and Tab. Note that to bind the
&acirc;&quot;&acirc; or &acirc;&rsquo;&acirc; keys,
quotation marks are necessary, for example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bind-key &rsquo;&quot;&rsquo;
split-window <br>
bind-key &quot;&rsquo;&quot; new-window</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Commands related to key bindings
are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bind-key [-cnr] [-t mode-table]
[-T key-table] key command [arguments] <br>
(alias: bind) <br>
Bind key key to command. Keys are bound in a key table. By
default (without -T), the key is bound in the prefix key
table. This table is used for keys pressed after the <br>
prefix key (for example, by default &acirc;c&acirc; is bound
to new-window in the prefix table, so &acirc;C-b c&acirc;
creates a new window). The root table is used for keys
pressed without the <br>
prefix key: binding &acirc;c&acirc; to new-window in the
root table (not recommended) means a plain &acirc;c&acirc;
will create a new window. -n is an alias for -T root. Keys
may also be bound <br>
in custom key tables and the switch-client -T command used
to switch to them from a key binding. The -r flag indicates
this key may repeat, see the repeat-time option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If -t is present, key is bound
in mode-table: the binding for command mode with -c or for
normal mode without. See the WINDOWS AND PANES section and
the list-keys command <br>
for information on mode key bindings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To view the default bindings and
possible commands, see the list-keys command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list-keys [-t mode-table] [-T
key-table] <br>
(alias: lsk) <br>
List all key bindings. Without -T all key tables are
printed. With -T only key-table.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With -t, the key bindings in
mode-table are listed; this may be one of: vi-edit,
emacs-edit, vi-choice, emacs-choice, vi-copy or
emacs-copy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">send-keys [-lMR] [-t
target-pane] key ... <br>
(alias: send) <br>
Send a key or keys to a window. Each argument key is the
name of the key (such as &acirc;C-a&acirc; or
&acirc;npage&acirc; ) to send; if the string is not
recognised as a key, it is sent as a <br>
series of characters. The -l flag disables key name lookup
and sends the keys literally. All arguments are sent
sequentially from first to last. The -R flag causes the <br>
terminal state to be reset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M passes through a mouse event
(only valid if bound to a mouse key binding, see MOUSE
SUPPORT).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">send-prefix [-2] [-t
target-pane] <br>
Send the prefix key, or with -2 the secondary prefix key, to
a window as if it was pressed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unbind-key [-acn] [-t
mode-table] [-T key-table] key <br>
(alias: unbind) <br>
Unbind the command bound to key. -c, -n, -T and -t are the
same as for bind-key. If -a is present, all key bindings are
removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The appearance and behaviour of tmux may be modified by
changing the value of various options. There are three types
of option: server options, session options and window
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The tmux server has a set of
global options which do not apply to any particular window
or session. These are altered with the set-option -s
command, or displayed with the <br>
show-options -s command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition, each individual
session may have a set of session options, and there is a
separate set of global session options. Sessions which do
not have a particular option con&acirc; <br>
figured inherit the value from the global session options.
Session options are set or unset with the set-option command
and may be listed with the show-options command. The <br>
available server and session options are listed under the
set-option command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Similarly, a set of window
options is attached to each window, and there is a set of
global window options from which any unset options are
inherited. Window options are altered <br>
with the set-window-option command and can be listed with
the show-window-options command. All window options are
documented with the set-window-option command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tmux also supports user options
which are prefixed with a &acirc;@&acirc;. User options may
have any name, so long as they are prefixed with
&acirc;@&acirc;, and be set to any string. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ tmux setw -q @foo
&quot;abc123&quot; <br>
$ tmux showw -v @foo <br>
abc123</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Commands which set options are
as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set-option [-agoqsuw] [-t
target-session | target-window] option value <br>
(alias: set) <br>
Set a window option with -w (equivalent to the
set-window-option command), a server option with -s,
otherwise a session option. If -g is given, the global
session or win&acirc; <br>
dow option is set. The -u flag unsets an option, so a
session inherits the option from the global options (or with
-g, restores a global option to the default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -o flag prevents setting an
option that is already set and the -q flag suppresses errors
about unknown or ambiguous options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With -a, and if the option
expects a string or a style, value is appended to the
existing setting. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set -g status-left
&quot;foo&quot; <br>
set -ag status-left &quot;bar&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Will result in
&acirc;foobar&acirc;. And:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set -g status-style
&quot;bg=red&quot; <br>
set -ag status-style &quot;fg=blue&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Will result in a red background
and blue foreground. Without -a, the result would be the
default background and a blue foreground.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Available window options are
listed under set-window-option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">value depends on the option and
may be a number, a string, or a flag (on, off, or omitted to
toggle).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Available server options
are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">buffer-limit number <br>
Set the number of buffers; as new buffers are added to the
top of the stack, old ones are removed from the bottom if
necessary to maintain this maximum length.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">default-terminal terminal <br>
Set the default terminal for new windows created in this
session - the default value of the TERM environment
variable. For tmux to work correctly, this must be set <br>
to &acirc;screen&acirc;, &acirc;tmux&acirc; or a derivative
of them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">escape-time time <br>
Set the time in milliseconds for which tmux waits after an
escape is input to determine if it is part of a function or
meta key sequences. The default is 500 mil&acirc; <br>
liseconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">exit-unattached [on | off] <br>
If enabled, the server will exit when there are no attached
clients.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">focus-events [on | off] <br>
When enabled, focus events are requested from the terminal
if supported and passed through to applications running in
tmux. Attached clients should be detached and <br>
attached again after changing this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">history-file path <br>
If not empty, a file to which tmux will write command prompt
history on exit and load it from on start.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">message-limit number <br>
Set the number of error or information messages to save in
the message log for each client. The default is 100.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set-clipboard [on | off] <br>
Attempt to set the terminal clipboard content using the
\]52;... 07 xterm(1) escape sequences. This option is on by
default if there is an Ms entry in the <br>
terminfo(5) description for the client terminal. Note that
this feature needs to be enabled in xterm(1) by setting the
resource:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">disallowedWindowOps:
20,21,SetXprop</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Or changing this property from
the xterm(1) interactive menu when required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">terminal-overrides string <br>
Contains a list of entries which override terminal
descriptions read using terminfo(5). string is a
comma-separated list of items each a colon-separated string
<br>
made up of a terminal type pattern (matched using
fnmatch(3)) and a set of name=value entries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, to set the
&acirc;clear&acirc; terminfo(5) entry to
&acirc;\[H\[2J&acirc; for all terminal types and the
&acirc;dch1&acirc; entry to &acirc;\[P&acirc; for the
&acirc;rxvt&acirc; terminal type, the option <br>
could be set to the string:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;*:clear=\[H\[2J,rxvt:dch1=\[P&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The terminal entry value is
passed through strunvis(3) before interpretation. The
default value forcibly corrects the &acirc;colors&acirc;
entry for terminals which support <br>
256 colours:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;*256col*:colors=256,xterm*:XT&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Available session options
are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">assume-paste-time milliseconds
<br>
If keys are entered faster than one in milliseconds, they
are assumed to have been pasted rather than typed and tmux
key bindings are not processed. The default is <br>
one millisecond and zero disables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">base-index index <br>
Set the base index from which an unused index should be
searched when a new window is created. The default is
zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bell-action [any | none |
current | other] <br>
Set action on window bell. any means a bell in any window
linked to a session causes a bell in the current window of
that session, none means all bells are <br>
ignored, current means only bells in windows other than the
current window are ignored and other means bells in the
current window are ignored but not those in <br>
other windows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bell-on-alert [on | off] <br>
If on, ring the terminal bell when an alert occurs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">default-command shell-command
<br>
Set the command used for new windows (if not specified when
the window is created) to shell-command, which may be any
sh(1) command. The default is an empty <br>
string, which instructs tmux to create a login shell using
the value of the default-shell option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">default-shell path <br>
Specify the default shell. This is used as the login shell
for new windows when the default-command option is set to
empty, and must be the full path of the exe&acirc; <br>
cutable. When started tmux tries to set a default value from
the first suitable of the SHELL environment variable, the
shell returned by getpwuid(3), or /bin/sh. <br>
This option should be configured when tmux is used as a
login shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">destroy-unattached [on | off]
<br>
If enabled and the session is no longer attached to any
clients, it is destroyed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">detach-on-destroy [on | off]
<br>
If on (the default), the client is detached when the session
it is attached to is destroyed. If off, the client is
switched to the most recently active of the <br>
remaining sessions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">display-panes-active-colour
colour <br>
Set the colour used by the display-panes command to show the
indicator for the active pane.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">display-panes-colour colour <br>
Set the colour used by the display-panes command to show the
indicators for inactive panes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">display-panes-time time <br>
Set the time in milliseconds for which the indicators shown
by the display-panes command appear.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">display-time time <br>
Set the amount of time for which status line messages and
other on-screen indicators are displayed. If set to 0,
messages and indicators are displayed until a key <br>
is pressed. time is in milliseconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">history-limit lines <br>
Set the maximum number of lines held in window history. This
setting applies only to new windows - existing window
histories are not resized and retain the limit <br>
at the point they were created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">key-table key-table <br>
Set the default key table to key-table instead of root.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lock-after-time number <br>
Lock the session (like the lock-session command) after
number seconds of inactivity. The default is not to lock
(set to 0).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lock-command shell-command <br>
Command to run when locking each client. The default is to
run lock(1) with -np.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">message-command-style style <br>
Set status line message command style, where style is a
comma-separated list of characteristics to be specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These may be
&acirc;bg=colour&acirc; to set the background colour,
&acirc;fg=colour&acirc; to set the foreground colour, and a
list of attributes as specified below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The colour is one of: black,
red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, white, aixterm
bright variants (if supported: brightred, brightgreen, and
so on), colour0 to <br>
colour255 from the 256-colour set, default, or a hexadecimal
RGB string such as &acirc;#ffffff&acirc;, which chooses the
closest match from the default 256-colour set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The attributes is either none or
a comma-delimited list of one or more of: bright (or bold),
dim, underscore, blink, reverse, hidden, or italics, to turn
an <br>
attribute on, or an attribute prefixed with &acirc;no&acirc;
to turn one off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fg=yellow,bold,underscore,blink
<br>
bg=black,fg=default,noreverse</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With the -a flag to the
set-option command the new style is added otherwise the
existing style is replaced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">message-style style <br>
Set status line message style. For how to specify style, see
the message-command-style option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mouse [on | off] <br>
If on, tmux captures the mouse and allows mouse events to be
bound as key bindings. See the MOUSE SUPPORT section for
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">prefix key <br>
Set the key accepted as a prefix key. In addition to the
standard keys described under KEY BINDINGS, prefix can be
set to the special key &acirc;None&acirc; to set no
prefix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">prefix2 key <br>
Set a secondary key accepted as a prefix key. Like prefix,
prefix2 can be set to &acirc;None&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">renumber-windows [on | off] <br>
If on, when a window is closed in a session, automatically
renumber the other windows in numerical order. This respects
the base-index option if it has been set. <br>
If off, do not renumber the windows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">repeat-time time <br>
Allow multiple commands to be entered without pressing the
prefix-key again in the specified time milliseconds (the
default is 500). Whether a key repeats may be <br>
set when it is bound using the -r flag to bind-key. Repeat
is enabled for the default keys bound to the resize-pane
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set-remain-on-exit [on | off]
<br>
Set the remain-on-exit window option for any windows first
created in this session. When this option is true, windows
in which the running program has exited do <br>
not close, instead remaining open but inactivate. Use the
respawn-window command to reactivate such a window, or the
kill-window command to destroy it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set-titles [on | off] <br>
Attempt to set the client terminal title using the tsl and
fsl terminfo(5) entries if they exist. tmux automatically
sets these to the \]0;... 07 sequence if the <br>
terminal appears to be xterm(1). This option is off by
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set-titles-string string <br>
String used to set the window title if set-titles is on.
Formats are expanded, see the FORMATS section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">status [on | off] <br>
Show or hide the status line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">status-interval interval <br>
Update the status bar every interval seconds. By default,
updates will occur every 15 seconds. A setting of zero
disables redrawing at interval.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">status-justify [left | centre |
right] <br>
Set the position of the window list component of the status
line: left, centre or right justified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">status-keys [vi | emacs] <br>
Use vi or emacs-style key bindings in the status line, for
example at the command prompt. The default is emacs, unless
the VISUAL or EDITOR environment variables <br>
are set and contain the string &acirc;vi&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">status-left string <br>
Display string (by default the session name) to the left of
the status bar. string will be passed through strftime(3)
and formats (see FORMATS) will be expanded. <br>
It may also contain any of the following special character
sequences:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Character pair Replaced with
<br>
#[attributes] Colour or attribute change <br>
## A literal &acirc;#&acirc;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For details on how the names and
titles can be set see the NAMES AND TITLES section. For a
list of allowed attributes see the message-command-style
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#(sysctl vm.loadavg) <br>
#[fg=yellow,bold]#(apm -l)%%#[default] [#S]</p>

to specify style, see the message-command-style option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">status-position [top | bottom]
<br>
Set the position of the status line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">status-right string <br>
Display string to the right of the status bar. By default,
the current window title in double quotes, the date and the
time are shown. As with status-left, string <br>
will be passed to strftime(3) and character pairs are
replaced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">status-right-length length <br>
Set the maximum length of the right component of the status
bar. The default is 40.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">status-right-style style <br>
Set the style of the right part of the status line. For how
to specify style, see the message-command-style option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">status-style style <br>
Set status line style. For how to specify style, see the
message-command-style option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">update-environment variables
<br>
Set a space-separated string containing a list of
environment variables to be copied into the session
environment when a new session is created or an existing
ses&acirc; <br>
sion is attached. Any variables that do not exist in the
source environment are set to be removed from the session
environment (as if -r was given to the <br>
set-environment command). The default is &quot;DISPLAY
SSH_ASKPASS SSH_AUTH_SOCK SSH_AGENT_PID SSH_CONNECTION
WINDOWID XAUTHORITY&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">visual-activity [on | off] <br>
If on, display a status line message when activity occurs in
a window for which the monitor-activity window option is
enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">visual-bell [on | off] <br>
If this option is on, a message is shown on a bell instead
of it being passed through to the terminal (which normally
makes a sound). Also see the bell-action <br>
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">visual-silence [on | off] <br>
If monitor-silence is enabled, prints a message after the
interval has expired on a given window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">word-separators string <br>
Sets the session&rsquo;s conception of what characters are
considered word separators, for the purposes of the next and
previous word commands in copy mode. The default <br>
is &acirc; -_@&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set-window-option [-agoqu] [-t
target-window] option value <br>
(alias: setw) <br>
Set a window option. The -a, -g, -o, -q and -u flags work
similarly to the set-option command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Supported window options
are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">aggressive-resize [on | off]
<br>
Aggressively resize the chosen window. This means that tmux
will resize the window to the size of the smallest session
for which it is the current window, rather <br>
than the smallest session to which it is attached. The
window may resize when the current window is changed on
another sessions; this option is good for full- <br>
screen programs which support SIGWINCH and poor for
interactive programs such as shells.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">allow-rename [on | off] <br>
Allow programs to change the window name using a terminal
escape sequence (\k...\\). The default is on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">alternate-screen [on | off] <br>
This option configures whether programs running inside tmux
may use the terminal alternate screen feature, which allows
the smcup and rmcup terminfo(5) capabili&acirc; <br>
ties. The alternate screen feature preserves the contents of
the window when an interactive application starts and
restores it on exit, so that any output visible <br>
before the application starts reappears unchanged after it
exits. The default is on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">automatic-rename [on | off] <br>
Control automatic window renaming. When this setting is
enabled, tmux will rename the window automatically using the
format specified by automatic-rename-format. <br>
This flag is automatically disabled for an individual window
when a name is specified at creation with new-window or
new-session, or later with rename-window, or <br>
with a terminal escape sequence. It may be switched off
globally with:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set-window-option -g
automatic-rename off</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">automatic-rename-format format
<br>
The format (see FORMATS) used when the automatic-rename
option is enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">clock-mode-colour colour <br>
Set clock colour.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">clock-mode-style [12 | 24] <br>
Set clock hour format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">force-height height <br>
force-width width <br>
Prevent tmux from resizing a window to greater than width or
height. A value of zero restores the default unlimited
setting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">main-pane-height height <br>
main-pane-width width <br>
Set the width or height of the main (left or top) pane in
the main-horizontal or main-vertical layouts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mode-keys [vi | emacs] <br>
Use vi or emacs-style key bindings in copy and choice modes.
As with the status-keys option, the default is emacs, unless
VISUAL or EDITOR contains &acirc;vi&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mode-style style <br>
Set window modes style. For how to specify style, see the
message-command-style option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">monitor-activity [on | off] <br>
Monitor for activity in the window. Windows with activity
are highlighted in the status line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">monitor-silence [interval] <br>
Monitor for silence (no activity) in the window within
interval seconds. Windows that have been silent for the
interval are highlighted in the status line. An <br>
interval of zero disables the monitoring.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">other-pane-height height <br>
Set the height of the other panes (not the main pane) in the
main-horizontal layout. If this option is set to 0 (the
default), it will have no effect. If both the <br>
main-pane-height and other-pane-height options are set, the
main pane will grow taller to make the other panes the
specified height, but will never shrink to do so.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">other-pane-width width <br>
Like other-pane-height, but set the width of other panes in
the main-vertical layout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pane-active-border-style style
<br>
Set the pane border style for the currently active pane. For
how to specify style, see the message-command-style option.
Attributes are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pane-base-index index <br>
Like base-index, but set the starting index for pane
numbers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pane-border-style style <br>
Set the pane border style for panes aside from the active
pane. For how to specify style, see the

with -w (equivalent to show-window-options), the server
options with -s, otherwise the session options for <br>
target session. Global session or window options are listed

(alias: showw) <br>
List the window options or a single option for
target-window, or the global window options if -g is used.
-v shows only the option value, not the name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOOKS <br>
tmux allows commands to run on various triggers, called
hooks. Each hook has a name. The following hooks are
available:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">alert-activity Run when a window
has activity. See monitor-activity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">alert-bell Run when a window has
received a bell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">alert-silence Run when a window
has been silent. See monitor-silence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">client-attached Run when a
client is attached.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">client-detached Run when a
client is detached</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">client-resized Run when a client
is resized.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pane-died Run when the program
running in a pane exits, but remain-on-exit is on so the
pane has not closed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pane-exited Run when the program
running in a pane exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hooks are managed with these
commands:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set-hook [-g] [-t
target-session] hook-name command <br>
Sets hook hook-name to command. If -g is given, hook-name is
added to the global list of hooks, otherwise it is added to
the session hooks (for target-session with -t). <br>
Like options, session hooks inherit from the global
ones.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">show-hooks [-g] [-t
target-session] <br>
Shows the global list of hooks with -g, otherwise the
session hooks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MOUSE SUPPORT <br>
If the mouse option is on (the default is off), tmux allows
mouse events to be bound as keys. The name of each key is
made up of a mouse event (such as &acirc;MouseUp1&acirc;)
and a location <br>
suffix (one of &acirc;Pane&acirc; for the contents of a
pane, &acirc;Border&acirc; for a pane border or
&acirc;Status&acirc; for the status line). The following
mouse events are available:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MouseDown1 MouseUp1 MouseDrag1
MouseDragEnd1 <br>
MouseDown2 MouseUp2 MouseDrag2 MouseDragEnd2 <br>
MouseDown3 MouseUp3 MouseDrag3 MouseDragEnd3 <br>
WheelUp WheelDown</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each should be suffixed with a
location, for example &acirc;MouseDown1Status&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The special token
&acirc;{mouse}&acirc; or &acirc;=&acirc; may be used as
target-window or target-pane in commands bound to mouse key
bindings. It resolves to the window or pane over which the
mouse <br>
event took place (for example, the window in the status line
over which button 1 was released for a
&acirc;MouseUp1Status&acirc; binding, or the pane over which
the wheel was scrolled for a <br>
&acirc;WheelDownPane&acirc; binding).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The send-keys -M flag may be
used to forward a mouse event to a pane.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default key bindings allow
the mouse to be used to select and resize panes, to copy
text and to change window using the status line. These take
effect if the mouse option is <br>
turned on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FORMATS <br>
Certain commands accept the -F flag with a format argument.
This is a string which controls the output format of the
command. Replacement variables are enclosed in
&acirc;#{&acirc; and &acirc;}&acirc;, <br>
for example &acirc;#{session_name}&acirc;. The possible
variables are listed in the table below, or the name of a
tmux option may be used for an option&rsquo;s value. Some
variables have a shorter <br>
alias such as &acirc;#S&acirc;, and &acirc;##&acirc; is
replaced by a single &acirc;#&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Conditionals are available by
prefixing with &acirc;?&acirc; and separating two
alternatives with a comma; if the specified variable exists
and is not zero, the first alternative is chosen, <br>
otherwise the second is used. For example
&acirc;#{?session_attached,attached,not attached}&acirc;
will include the string &acirc;attached&acirc; if the
session is attached and the string &acirc;not
attached&acirc; <br>
if it is unattached, or
&acirc;#{?automatic-rename,yes,no}&acirc; will include
&acirc;yes&acirc; if automatic-rename is enabled, or
&acirc;no&acirc; if not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A limit may be placed on the
length of the resultant string by prefixing it by an
&acirc;=&acirc;, a number and a colon. Positive numbers
count from the start of the string and negative from <br>
the end, so &acirc;#{=5:pane_title}&acirc; will include at
most the first 5 characters of the pane title, or
&acirc;#{=-5:pane_title}&acirc; the last 5 characters.
Prefixing a time variable with &acirc;t:&acirc; <br>
will convert it to a string, so if
&acirc;#{window_activity}&acirc; gives
&acirc;1445765102&acirc;, &acirc;#{t:window_activity}&acirc;
gives &acirc;Sun Oct 25 09:25:02 2015&acirc;. The
&acirc;b:&acirc; and &acirc;d:&acirc; prefixes are
basename(3) and <br>
dirname(3) of the variable respectively. A prefix of the
form &acirc;s/foo/bar/:&acirc; will substitute
&acirc;foo&acirc; with &acirc;bar&acirc; throughout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition, the first line of a
shell command&rsquo;s output may be inserted using
&acirc;#()&acirc;. For example, &acirc;#(uptime)&acirc; will
insert the system&rsquo;s uptime. When constructing formats,
tmux <br>
does not wait for &acirc;#()&acirc; commands to finish;
instead, the previous result from running the same command
is used, or a placeholder if the command has not been run
before. Commands <br>
are executed with the tmux global environment set (see the
ENVIRONMENT section).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following variables are
available, where appropriate:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Variable name Alias Replaced

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAMES AND TITLES <br>
tmux distinguishes between names and titles. Windows and
sessions have names, which may be used to specify them in
targets and are displayed in the status line and various
lists: <br>
the name is the tmux identifier for a window or session.
Only panes have titles. A pane&rsquo;s title is typically
set by the program running inside the pane and is not
modified by <br>
tmux. It is the same mechanism used to set for example the
xterm(1) window title in an X(7) window manager. Windows
themselves do not have titles - a window&rsquo;s title is
the title <br>
of its active pane. tmux itself may set the title of the
terminal in which the client is running, see the set-titles
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A session&rsquo;s name is set
with the new-session and rename-session commands. A
window&rsquo;s name is set with one of:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. A command argument (such as
-n for new-window or new-session).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. An escape sequence:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ printf &rsquo; 33kWINDOW_NAME
33\&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. Automatic renaming, which
sets the name to the active command in the window&rsquo;s
active pane. See the automatic-rename option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a pane is first created,
its title is the hostname. A pane&rsquo;s title can be set
via the OSC title setting sequence, for example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ printf &rsquo; 33]2;My Title
33\&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
When the server is started, tmux copies the environment into
the global environment; in addition, each session has a
session environment. When a window is created, the session
and <br>
global environments are merged. If a variable exists in
both, the value from the session environment is used. The
result is the initial environment passed to the new
process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The update-environment session
option may be used to update the session environment from
the client when a new session is created or an old
reattached. tmux also initialises the <br>
TMUX variable with some internal information to allow
commands to be executed from inside, and the TERM variable
with the correct terminal setting of
&acirc;screen&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Commands to alter and view the
environment are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set-environment [-gru] [-t
target-session] name [value] <br>
(alias: setenv) <br>
Set or unset an environment variable. If -g is used, the
change is made in the global environment; otherwise, it is
applied to the session environment for target-session. <br>
The -u flag unsets a variable. -r indicates the variable is
to be removed from the environment before starting a new
process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">show-environment [-gs] [-t
target-session] [variable] <br>
(alias: showenv) <br>
Display the environment for target-session or the global
environment with -g. If variable is omitted, all variables
are shown. Variables removed from the environment are <br>
prefixed with &acirc;-&acirc;. If -s is used, the output is
formatted as a set of Bourne shell commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STATUS LINE <br>
tmux includes an optional status line which is displayed in
the bottom line of each terminal. By default, the status
line is enabled (it may be disabled with the status session
<br>
option) and contains, from left-to-right: the name of the
current session in square brackets; the window list; the
title of the active pane in double quotes; and the time and
date.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The status line is made of three
parts: configurable left and right sections (which may
contain dynamic content such as the time or output from a
shell command, see the <br>
status-left, status-left-length, status-right, and
status-right-length options below), and a central window
list. By default, the window list shows the index, name and
(if any) <br>
flag of the windows present in the current session in
ascending numerical order. It may be customised with the
window-status-format and window-status-current-format
options. The <br>
flag is one of the following symbols appended to the window
name:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Symbol Meaning <br>
* Denotes the current window. <br>
- Marks the last window (previously selected). <br>
# Window is monitored and activity has been detected. <br>
! A bell has occurred in the window. <br>
~ The window has been silent for the monitor-silence
interval. <br>
M The window contains the marked pane. <br>
Z The window&rsquo;s active pane is zoomed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The # symbol relates to the
monitor-activity window option. The window name is printed
in inverted colours if an alert (bell, activity or silence)
is present.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The colour and attributes of the
status line may be configured, the entire status line using
the status-style session option and individual windows using
the window-status-style <br>
window option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The status line is automatically
refreshed at interval if it has changed, the interval may be
controlled with the status-interval session option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Commands related to the status
line are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">command-prompt [-I inputs] [-p
prompts] [-t target-client] [template] <br>
Open the command prompt in a client. This may be used from
inside tmux to execute commands interactively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If template is specified, it is
used as the command. If present, -I is a comma-separated
list of the initial text for each prompt. If -p is given,
prompts is a comma-sep&acirc; <br>
arated list of prompts which are displayed in order;
otherwise a single prompt is displayed, constructed from
template if it is present, or &acirc;:&acirc; if not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Both inputs and prompts may
contain the special character sequences supported by the
status-left option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Before the command is executed,
the first occurrence of the string &acirc;%%&acirc; and all
occurrences of &acirc;%1&acirc; are replaced by the response
to the first prompt, the second &acirc;%%&acirc; and <br>
all &acirc;%2&acirc; are replaced with the response to the
second prompt, and so on for further prompts. Up to nine
prompt responses may be replaced (&acirc;%1&acirc; to
&acirc;%9&acirc;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">confirm-before [-p prompt] [-t
target-client] command <br>
(alias: confirm) <br>
Ask for confirmation before executing command. If -p is
given, prompt is the prompt to display; otherwise a prompt
is constructed from command. It may contain the special <br>
character sequences supported by the status-left option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command works only from
inside tmux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">display-message [-p] [-c
target-client] [-t target-pane] [message] <br>
(alias: display) <br>
Display a message. If -p is given, the output is printed to
stdout, otherwise it is displayed in the target-client
status line. The format of message is described in the <br>
FORMATS section; information is taken from target-pane if -t
is given, otherwise the active pane for the session attached
to target-client.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUFFERS <br>
tmux maintains a set of named paste buffers. Each buffer may
be either explicitly or automatically named. Explicitly
named buffers are named when created with the set-buffer or
<br>
load-buffer commands, or by renaming an automatically named
buffer with set-buffer -n. Automatically named buffers are
given a name such as &acirc;buffer0001&acirc;,
&acirc;buffer0002&acirc; and so on. <br>
When the buffer-limit option is reached, the oldest
automatically named buffer is deleted. Explicitly named are
not subject to buffer-limit and may be deleted with
delete-buffer <br>
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Buffers may be added using
copy-mode or the set-buffer and load-buffer commands, and
pasted into a window using the paste-buffer command. If a
buffer command is used and no buffer <br>
is specified, the most recently added automatically named
buffer is assumed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A configurable history buffer is
also maintained for each window. By default, up to 2000
lines are kept; this can be altered with the history-limit
option (see the set-option com&acirc; <br>
mand above).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The buffer commands are as
follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">choose-buffer [-F format] [-t
target-window] [template] <br>
Put a window into buffer choice mode, where a buffer may be
chosen interactively from a list. After a buffer is
selected, &acirc;%%&acirc; is replaced by the buffer name in
template <br>
and the result executed as a command. If template is not
given, &quot;paste-buffer -b &rsquo;%%&rsquo;&quot; is used.
For the meaning of the -F flag, see the FORMATS section.
This command <br>
works only if at least one client is attached.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">clear-history [-t target-pane]
<br>
(alias: clearhist) <br>
Remove and free the history for the specified pane.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">delete-buffer [-b buffer-name]
<br>
(alias: deleteb) <br>
Delete the buffer named buffer-name, or the most recently
added automatically named buffer if not specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list-buffers [-F format] <br>
(alias: lsb) <br>
List the global buffers. For the meaning of the -F flag, see
the FORMATS section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">load-buffer [-b buffer-name]
path <br>
(alias: loadb) <br>
Load the contents of the specified paste buffer from
path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">paste-buffer [-dpr] [-b
buffer-name] [-s separator] [-t target-pane] <br>
(alias: pasteb) <br>
Insert the contents of a paste buffer into the specified
pane. If not specified, paste into the current one. With -d,
also delete the paste buffer. When output, any <br>
linefeed (LF) characters in the paste buffer are replaced
with a separator, by default carriage return (CR). A custom
separator may be specified using the -s flag. The -r <br>
flag means to do no replacement (equivalent to a separator
of LF). If -p is specified, paste bracket control codes are
inserted around the buffer if the application has <br>
requested bracketed paste mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">save-buffer [-a] [-b
buffer-name] path <br>
(alias: saveb) <br>
Save the contents of the specified paste buffer to path. The
-a option appends to rather than overwriting the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set-buffer [-a] [-b buffer-name]
[-n new-buffer-name] data <br>
(alias: setb) <br>
Set the contents of the specified buffer to data. The -a
option appends to rather than overwriting the buffer. The -n
option renames the buffer to new-buffer-name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">show-buffer [-b buffer-name]
<br>
(alias: showb) <br>
Display the contents of the specified buffer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MISCELLANEOUS <br>
Miscellaneous commands are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">clock-mode [-t target-pane] <br>
Display a large clock.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if-shell [-bF] [-t target-pane]
shell-command command [command] <br>
(alias: if) <br>
Execute the first command if shell-command returns success
or the second command otherwise. Before being executed,
shell-command is expanded using the rules specified in <br>
the FORMATS section, including those relevant to
target-pane. With -b, shell-command is run in the
background.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If -F is given, shell-command is
not executed but considered success if neither empty nor
zero (after formats are expanded).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lock-server <br>
(alias: lock) <br>
Lock each client individually by running the command
specified by the lock-command option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">run-shell [-b] [-t target-pane]
shell-command <br>
(alias: run) <br>
Execute shell-command in the background without creating a
window. Before being executed, shell-command is expanded
using the rules specified in the FORMATS section. With <br>
-b, the command is run in the background. After it finishes,
any output to stdout is displayed in copy mode (in the pane
specified by -t or the current pane if omitted). <br>
If the command doesn&rsquo;t return success, the exit status
is also displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wait-for [-L | -S | -U] channel
<br>
(alias: wait) <br>
When used without options, prevents the client from exiting
until woken using wait-for -S with the same channel. When -L
is used, the channel is locked and any clients <br>
that try to lock the same channel are made to wait until the
channel is unlocked with wait-for -U. This command only
works from outside tmux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TERMINFO EXTENSIONS <br>
tmux understands some unofficial extensions to
terminfo(5):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cs, Cr Set the cursor colour.
The first takes a single string argument and is used to set
the colour; the second takes no arguments and restores the
default cursor colour. If <br>
set, a sequence such as this may be used to change the
cursor colour from inside tmux:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ printf &rsquo; 33]12;red
33\&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ss, Se Set or reset the cursor
style. If set, a sequence such as this may be used to change
the cursor to an underline:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ printf &rsquo; 33[4
q&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If Se is not set, Ss with
argument 0 will be used to reset the cursor style
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tc Indicate that the terminal
supports the &acirc;direct colour&acirc; RGB escape sequence
(for example, \[38;2;255;255;255m).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ms Store the current buffer in
the host terminal&rsquo;s selection (clipboard). See the
set-clipboard option above and the xterm(1) man page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONTROL MODE <br>
tmux offers a textual interface called control mode. This
allows applications to communicate with tmux using a simple
text-only protocol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In control mode, a client sends
tmux commands or command sequences terminated by newlines on
standard input. Each command will produce one block of
output on standard output. An <br>
output block consists of a %begin line followed by the
output (which may be empty). The output block ends with a
%end or %error. %begin and matching %end or %error have two
argu&acirc; <br>
ments: an integer time (as seconds from epoch) and command
number. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%begin 1363006971 2 <br>
0: ksh* (1 panes) [80x24] [layout b25f,80x24,0,0,2] @2
(active) <br>
%end 1363006971 2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In control mode, tmux outputs
notifications. A notification will never occur inside an
output block.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following notifications are
defined:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%exit [reason] <br>
The tmux client is exiting immediately, either because it is
not attached to any session or an error occurred. If
present, reason describes why the client exited.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%layout-change window-id
window-layout window-visible-layout window-flags <br>
The layout of a window with ID window-id changed. The new
layout is window-layout. The window&rsquo;s visible layout
is window-visible-layout and the window flags are <br>
window-flags.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%output pane-id value <br>
A window pane produced output. value escapes non-printable
characters and backslash as octal .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%session-changed session-id name
<br>
The client is now attached to the session with ID
session-id, which is named name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%session-renamed name <br>
The current session was renamed to name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%sessions-changed <br>
A session was created or destroyed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%unlinked-window-add window-id
<br>
The window with ID window-id was created but is not linked
to the current session.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%window-add window-id <br>
The window with ID window-id was linked to the current
session.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%window-close window-id <br>
The window with ID window-id closed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%window-renamed window-id name
<br>
The window with ID window-id was renamed to name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
~/.tmux.conf Default tmux configuration file. <br>
/etc/tmux.conf System-wide configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
To create a new tmux session running vi(1):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ tmux new-session vi</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most commands have a shorter
form, known as an alias. For new-session, this is new:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ tmux new vi</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alternatively, the shortest
unambiguous form of a command is accepted. If there are
several options, they are listed:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ tmux n <br>
ambiguous command: n, could be: new-session, new-window,
next-window</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Within an active session, a new
window may be created by typing &acirc;C-b c&acirc; (Ctrl
followed by the &acirc;b&acirc; key followed by the
&acirc;c&acirc; key).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Windows may be navigated with:
&acirc;C-b 0&acirc; (to select window 0), &acirc;C-b
1&acirc; (to select window 1), and so on; &acirc;C-b
n&acirc; to select the next window; and &acirc;C-b p&acirc;
to select the previous window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A session may be detached using
&acirc;C-b d&acirc; (or by an external event such as ssh(1)
disconnection) and reattached with:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ tmux attach-session</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Typing &acirc;C-b ?&acirc; lists
the current key bindings in the current window; up and down
may be used to navigate the list or &acirc;q&acirc; to exit
from it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Commands to be run when the tmux
server is started may be placed in the ~/.tmux.conf
configuration file. Common examples include:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Changing the default prefix
key:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set-option -g prefix C-a <br>
unbind-key C-b <br>
bind-key C-a send-prefix</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Turning the status line off, or
changing its colour:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set-option -g status off <br>
set-option -g status-style bg=blue</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Setting other options, such as
the default command, or locking after 30 minutes of
inactivity:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set-option -g default-command
&quot;exec /bin/ksh&quot; <br>
set-option -g lock-after-time 1800</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Creating new key bindings:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bind-key b set-option status
<br>
bind-key / command-prompt &quot;split-window &rsquo;exec man
%%&rsquo;&quot; <br>
bind-key S command-prompt &quot;new-window -n %1 &rsquo;ssh
%1&rsquo;&quot;</p>
