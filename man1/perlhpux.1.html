<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
perlhpux - Perl version 5 on Hewlett-Packard Unix (HP-UX)
systems</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This document describes various features of HP&rsquo;s Unix
operating system (HP-UX) that will affect how Perl version 5
(hereafter just Perl) is compiled and/or runs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using perl as shipped with HP-UX
<br>
Application release September 2001, HP-UX 11.00 is the first
to ship with Perl. By the time it was perl-5.6.1 in
/opt/perl. The first occurrence is on CD 5012-7954 and can
be <br>
installed using</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">swinstall -s /cdrom perl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">assuming you have mounted that
CD on /cdrom. In this version the following modules were
installed:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ActivePerl::DocTools-0.04
HTML::Parser-3.19 XML::DOM-1.25 <br>
Archive::Tar-0.072 HTML::Tagset-3.03 XML::Parser-2.27 <br>
Compress::Zlib-1.08 MIME::Base64-2.11 XML::Simple-1.05 <br>
Convert::ASN1-0.10 Net-1.07 XML::XPath-1.09 <br>
Digest::MD5-2.11 PPM-2.1.5 XML::XSLT-0.32 <br>
File::CounterFile-0.12 SOAP::Lite-0.46 libwww-perl-5.51 <br>
Font::AFM-1.18 Storable-1.011 libxml-perl-0.07 <br>
HTML-Tree-3.11 URI-1.11 perl-ldap-0.23</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">That build was a portable
hppa-1.1 multithread build that supports large files
compiled with gcc-2.9-hppa-991112.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you perform a new
installation, then (a newer) Perl will be installed
automatically. Preinstalled HP-UX systems now slao have more
recent versions of Perl and the updated <br>
modules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The official (threaded) builds
from HP, as they are shipped on the Application
DVD/CD&rsquo;s are available on <br>

&lt;http://www.software.hp.com/portal/swdepot/displayProductInfo.do?productNumber=PERL&gt;
for both PA-RISC and IPF (Itanium Processor Family). They
are built with the HP ANSI-C <br>
compiler. Up till 5.8.8 that was done by ActiveState.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To see what version is included
on the DVD (assumed here to be mounted on /cdrom), issue
this command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># swlist -s /cdrom perl <br>
# perl D.5.8.8.B 5.8.8 Perl Programming Language <br>
perl.Perl5-32 D.5.8.8.B 32-bit 5.8.8 Perl Programming
Language with Extensions <br>
perl.Perl5-64 D.5.8.8.B 64-bit 5.8.8 Perl Programming
Language with Extensions</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using perl from HP&rsquo;s
porting centre <br>
HP porting centre tries very hard to keep up with customer
demand and release updates from the Open Source community.
Having precompiled Perl binaries available is obvious.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The HP porting centres are
limited in what systems they are allowed to port to and they
usually choose the two most recent OS versions available.
This means that at the moment of <br>
writing, there are only HP-UX 11.11 (pa-risc 2.0) and HP-UX
11.23 (Itanium 2) ports available on the porting
centres.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HP has asked the porting centre
to move Open Source binaries from /opt to /usr/local, so
binaries produced since the start of July 2002 are located
in /usr/local.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One of HP porting centres
URL&rsquo;s is &lt;http://hpux.connect.org.uk/&gt; The port
currently available is built with GNU gcc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Compiling Perl 5 on HP-UX <br>
When compiling Perl, you must use an ANSI C compiler. The C
compiler that ships with all HP-UX systems is a K&amp;R
compiler that should only be used to build new kernels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl can be compiled with either
HP&rsquo;s ANSI C compiler or with gcc. The former is
recommended, as not only can it compile Perl with no
difficulty, but also can take advantage of <br>
features listed later that require the use of HP
compiler-specific command-line flags.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you decide to use gcc, make
sure your installation is recent and complete, and be sure
to read the Perl INSTALL file for more gcc-specific
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PA-RISC <br>
HP&rsquo;s HP9000 Unix systems run on HP&rsquo;s own
Precision Architecture (PA-RISC) chip. HP-UX used to run on
the Motorola MC68000 family of chips, but any machine with
this chip in it <br>
is quite obsolete and this document will not attempt to
address issues for compiling Perl on the Motorola
chipset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The version of PA-RISC at the
time of this document&rsquo;s last update is 2.0, which is
also the last there will be. HP PA-RISC systems are usually
refered to with model description <br>
&quot;HP 9000&quot;. The last CPU in this series is the
PA-8900. Support for PA-RISC architectured machines
officially ends as shown in the following table:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">From
&lt;http://www.hp.com/products1/evolution/9000/faqs.html&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The last order date for HP 9000
systems was December 31, 2008.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A complete list of models at the
time the OS was built is in the file
/usr/sam/lib/mo/sched.models. The first column corresponds
to the last part of the output of the &quot;model&quot; <br>
command. The second column is the PA-RISC version and the
third column is the exact chip type used. (Start browsing at
the bottom to prevent confusion ;-)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Portability Between PA-RISC
Versions <br>
An executable compiled on a PA-RISC 2.0 platform will not
execute on a PA-RISC 1.1 platform, even if they are running
the same version of HP-UX. If you are building Perl on a
<br>
PA-RISC 2.0 platform and want that Perl to also run on a
PA-RISC 1.1, the compiler flags +DAportable and +DS32 should
be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is no longer possible to
compile PA-RISC 1.0 executables on either the PA-RISC 1.1 or
2.0 platforms. The command-line flags are accepted, but the
resulting executable will <br>
not run when transferred to a PA-RISC 1.0 system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PA-RISC 1.0 <br>
The original version of PA-RISC, HP no longer sells any
system with this chip.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following systems contained
PA-RISC 1.0 chips:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">600, 635, 645, 808, 815, 822,

(upgrades, etc.) <br>

&lsquo;------ t = tower <br>
r = rack optimized <br>
s = super scalable <br>
b = blade <br>
sa = appliance</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Itanium Processor Family (IPF)
and HP-UX <br>
HP-UX also runs on the new Itanium processor. This requires
the use of a different version of HP-UX (currently 11.23 or
11i v2), and with the exception of a few differences <br>
detailed below and in later sections, Perl should compile
with no problems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Although PA-RISC binaries can
run on Itanium systems, you should not attempt to use a
PA-RISC version of Perl on an Itanium system. This is
because shared libraries created on <br>
an Itanium system cannot be loaded while running a PA-RISC
executable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HP Itanium 2 systems are usually
refered to with model description &quot;HP
Integrity&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Itanium, Itanium 2 &amp; Madison

hardware/OS support and expected end-of-life
&lt;http://www.hp.com/go/hpuxservermatrix&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Building Dynamic Extensions on
HP-UX <br>
HP-UX supports dynamically loadable libraries (shared
libraries). Shared libraries end with the suffix .sl. On
Itanium systems, they end with the suffix .so.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Shared libraries created on a
platform using a particular PA-RISC version are not usable
on platforms using an earlier PA-RISC version by default.
However, this backwards <br>
compatibility may be enabled using the same +DAportable
compiler flag (with the same PA-RISC 1.0 caveat mentioned
above).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Shared libraries created on an
Itanium platform cannot be loaded on a PA-RISC platform.
Shared libraries created on a PA-RISC platform can only be
loaded on an Itanium platform <br>
if it is a PA-RISC executable that is attempting to load the
PA-RISC library. A PA-RISC shared library cannot be loaded
into an Itanium executable nor vice-versa.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To create a shared library, the
following steps must be performed:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. Compile source modules with
+z or +Z flag to create a .o module <br>
which contains Position-Independent Code (PIC). The linker
will <br>
tell you in the next step if +Z was needed. <br>
(For gcc, the appropriate flag is -fpic or -fPIC.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Link the shared library using
the -b flag. If the code calls <br>
any functions in other system libraries (e.g., libm), it
must <br>
be included on this line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(Note that these steps are
usually handled automatically by the extension&rsquo;s
Makefile).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If these dependent libraries are
not listed at shared library creation time, you will get
fatal &quot;Unresolved symbol&quot; errors at run time when
the library is loaded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may create a shared library
that refers to another library, which may be either an
archive library or a shared library. If this second library
is a shared library, this is <br>
called a &quot;dependent library&quot;. The dependent
library&rsquo;s name is recorded in the main shared library,
but it is not linked into the shared library. Instead, it is
loaded when the <br>
main shared library is loaded. This can cause problems if
you build an extension on one system and move it to another
system where the libraries may not be located in the same
<br>
place as on the first system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the referred library is an
archive library, then it is treated as a simple collection
of .o modules (all of which must contain PIC). These modules
are then linked into the <br>
shared library.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that it is okay to create a
library which contains a dependent library that is already
linked into perl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some extensions, like DB_File
and Compress::Zlib use/require prebuilt libraries for the
perl extensions/modules to work. If these libraries are
built using the default <br>
configuration, it might happen that you run into an error
like &quot;invalid loader fixup&quot; during load phase. HP
is aware of this problem. Search the HP-UX cxx-dev forums
for <br>
discussions about the subject. The short answer is that
everything (all libraries, everything) must be compiled with
&quot;+z&quot; or &quot;+Z&quot; to be PIC (position
independent code). (For <br>
gcc, that would be &quot;-fpic&quot; or &quot;-fPIC&quot;).
In HP-UX 11.00 or newer the linker error message should tell
the name of the offending object file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A more general approach is to
intervene manually, as with an example for the DB_File
module, which requires SleepyCat&rsquo;s libdb.sl:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># cd .../db-3.2.9/build_unix
<br>
# vi Makefile <br>
... add +Z to all cflags to create shared objects <br>
CFLAGS= -c $(CPPFLAGS) +Z -Ae +O2 +Onolimit
-I/usr/local/include -I/usr/include/X11R6 <br>
CXXFLAGS= -c $(CPPFLAGS) +Z -Ae +O2 +Onolimit
-I/usr/local/include -I/usr/include/X11R6</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># make clean <br>
# make <br>
# mkdir tmp <br>
# cd tmp <br>
# ar x ../libdb.a <br>
# ld -b -o libdb-3.2.sl *.o <br>
# mv libdb-3.2.sl /usr/local/lib <br>
# rm *.o <br>
# cd /usr/local/lib <br>
# rm -f libdb.sl <br>
# ln -s libdb-3.2.sl libdb.sl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># cd .../DB_File-1.76 <br>
# make distclean <br>
# perl Makefile.PL <br>
# make <br>
# make test <br>
# make install</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As of db-4.2.x it is no longer
needed to do this by hand. Sleepycat has changed the
configuration process to add +z on HP-UX automatically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># cd .../db-4.2.25/build_unix
<br>
# env CFLAGS=+DD64 LDFLAGS=+DD64 ../dist/configure</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">should work to generate 64bit
shared libraries for HP-UX 11.00 and 11i.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is no longer possible to link
PA-RISC 1.0 shared libraries (even though the command-line
flags are still present).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PA-RISC and Itanium object files
are not interchangeable. Although you may be able to use ar
to create an archive library of PA-RISC object files on an
Itanium system, you <br>
cannot link against it using an Itanium link editor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The HP ANSI C Compiler <br>
When using this compiler to build Perl, you should make sure
that the flag -Aa is added to the cpprun and cppstdin
variables in the config.sh file (though see the section on
<br>
64-bit perl below). If you are using a recent version of the
Perl distribution, these flags are set automatically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Even though HP-UX 10.20 and
11.00 are not actively maintained by HP anymore, updates for
the HP ANSI C compiler are still available from time to
time, and it might be advisable <br>

the latests available patches for 11.00 that should be

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The GNU C Compiler <br>
When you are going to use the GNU C compiler (gcc), and you
don&rsquo;t have gcc yet, you can either build it yourself
from the sources (available from e.g. <br>
&lt;http://gcc.gnu.org/mirrors.html&gt;) or fetch a prebuilt
binary from the HP porting center. gcc prebuilds can be
fetched from <br>

&lt;http://h21007.www2.hp.com/dspp/tech/tech_TechSoftwareDetailPage_IDX/1,1703,547,00.html&gt;
(Browse through the list, because there are often multiple
versions of the same package <br>
available).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Above mentioned distributions
are depots. H.Merijn Brand has made prebuilt gcc binaries
available on &lt;http://mirrors.develooper.com/hpux/&gt;
and/or &lt;http://www.cmve.net/~merijn/&gt; <br>
for HP-UX 10.20, HP-UX 11.00, HP-UX 11.11 (HP-UX 11i v1),
and HP-UX 11.23 (HP-UX 11i v2) in both 32- and 64-bit
versions. These are bzipped tar archives that also include
recent <br>
GNU binutils and GNU gdb. Read the instructions on that page
to rebuild gcc using itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On PA-RISC you need a different
compiler for 32-bit applications and for 64-bit
applications. On PA-RISC, 32-bit objects and 64-bit objects
do not mix. Period. There is no <br>
different behaviour for HP C-ANSI-C or GNU gcc. So if you
require your perl binary to use 64-bit libraries, like
Oracle-64bit, you MUST build a 64-bit perl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Building a 64-bit capable gcc on
PA-RISC from source is possible only when you have the HP
C-ANSI C compiler or an already working 64-bit binary of gcc
available. Best <br>
performance for perl is achieved with HP&rsquo;s native
compiler.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using Large Files with Perl on
HP-UX <br>
Beginning with HP-UX version 10.20, files larger than 2GB
(2^31 bytes) may be created and manipulated. Three separate
methods of doing this are available. Of these methods, the
<br>
best method for Perl is to compile using the -Duselargefiles
flag to Configure. This causes Perl to be compiled using
structures and functions in which these are 64 bits wide,
<br>
rather than 32 bits wide. (Note that this will only work
with HP&rsquo;s ANSI C compiler. If you want to compile Perl
using gcc, you will have to get a version of the compiler
that <br>
supports 64-bit operations. See above for where to find
it.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are some drawbacks to this
approach. One is that any extension which calls any
file-manipulating C function will need to be recompiled
(just follow the usual &quot;perl <br>
Makefile.PL; make; make test; make install&quot;
procedure).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The list of functions that will
need to recompiled is: <br>
creat, fgetpos, fopen, <br>
freopen, fsetpos, fstat, <br>
fstatvfs, fstatvfsdev, ftruncate, <br>
ftw, lockf, lseek, <br>
lstat, mmap, nftw, <br>
open, prealloc, stat, <br>
statvfs, statvfsdev, tmpfile, <br>
truncate, getrlimit, setrlimit</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another drawback is only valid
for Perl versions before 5.6.0. This drawback is that the
seek and tell functions (both the builtin version and POSIX
module version) will not <br>
perform correctly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is strongly recommended that
you use this flag when you run Configure. If you do not do
this, but later answer the question about large files when
Configure asks you, you may <br>
get a configuration that cannot be compiled, or that does
not function as expected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Threaded Perl on HP-UX <br>
It is possible to compile a version of threaded Perl on any
version of HP-UX before 10.30, but it is strongly suggested
that you be running on HP-UX 11.00 at least.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To compile Perl with threads,
add -Dusethreads to the arguments of Configure. Verify that
the -D_POSIX_C_SOURCE=199506L compiler flag is automatically
added to the list of <br>
flags. Also make sure that -lpthread is listed before -lc in
the list of libraries to link Perl with. The hints provided
for HP-UX during Configure will try very hard to get <br>
this right for you.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HP-UX versions before 10.30
require a separate installation of a POSIX threads library
package. Two examples are the HP DCE package, available on
&quot;HP-UX Hardware Extensions 3.0, <br>
Install and Core OS, Release 10.20, April 1999
(B3920-13941)&quot; or the Freely available PTH package,
available on H.Merijn&rsquo;s site
(&lt;http://mirrors.develooper.com/hpux/&gt;). The use <br>
of PTH will be unsupported in perl-5.12 and up and is rather
buggy in 5.11.x.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are going to use the HP
DCE package, the library used for threading is
/usr/lib/libcma.sl, but there have been multiple updates of
that library over time. Perl will build <br>
with the first version, but it will not pass the test suite.
Older Oracle versions might be a compelling reason not to
update that library, otherwise please find a newer version
<br>
in one of the following patches: PHSS_19739, PHSS_20608, or
PHSS_23672</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you choose for the PTH

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># cd /usr/lib <br>
# ln -s /opt/pth/lib/libpth* .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For building perl to support
Oracle, it needs to be linked with libcl and libpthread. So
even if your perl is an unthreaded build, these libraries
might be required. See &quot;Oracle <br>
on HP-UX&quot; below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">64-bit Perl on HP-UX <br>
Beginning with HP-UX 11.00, programs compiled under HP-UX
can take advantage of the LP64 programming environment (LP64
means Longs and Pointers are 64 bits wide), in which scalar
<br>
variables will be able to hold numbers larger than 2^32 with
complete precision. Perl has proven to be consistent and
reliable in 64bit mode since 5.8.1 on all HP-UX 11.xx.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As of the date of this document,
Perl is fully 64-bit compliant on HP-UX 11.00 and up for
both cc- and gcc builds. If you are about to build a 64-bit
perl with GNU gcc, please <br>
read the gcc section carefully.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Should a user have the need for
compiling Perl in the LP64 environment, use the
-Duse64bitall flag to Configure. This will force Perl to be
compiled in a pure LP64 environment <br>
(with the +DD64 flag for HP C-ANSI-C, with no additional
options for GNU gcc 64-bit on PA-RISC, and with -mlp64 for
GNU gcc on Itanium). If you want to compile Perl using gcc,
<br>
you will have to get a version of the compiler that supports
64-bit operations.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also use the
-Duse64bitint flag to Configure. Although there are some
minor differences between compiling Perl with this flag
versus the -Duse64bitall flag, they should <br>
not be noticeable from a Perl user&rsquo;s perspective. When
configuring -Duse64bitint using a 64bit gcc on a pa-risc
architecture, -Duse64bitint is silently promoted to
-Duse64bitall.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In both cases, it is strongly
recommended that you use these flags when you run Configure.
If you do not use do this, but later answer the questions
about 64-bit numbers when <br>
Configure asks you, you may get a configuration that cannot
be compiled, or that does not function as expected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Oracle on HP-UX <br>
Using perl to connect to Oracle databases through DBI and
DBD::Oracle has caused a lot of people many headaches. Read
README.hpux in the DBD::Oracle for much more information.
<br>
The reason to mention it here is that Oracle requires a perl
built with libcl and libpthread, the latter even when perl
is build without threads. Building perl using all <br>
defaults, but still enabling to build DBD::Oracle later on
can be achieved using</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Configure -A
prepend:libswanted=&rsquo;cl pthread &rsquo; ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Do not forget the space before
the trailing quote.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also note that this does not
(yet) work with all configurations, it is known to fail with
64-bit versions of GCC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GDBM and Threads on HP-UX <br>
If you attempt to compile Perl with (POSIX) threads on an
11.X system and also link in the GDBM library, then Perl
will immediately core dump when it starts up. The only <br>
workaround at this point is to relink the GDBM library under
11.X, then relink it into Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">the error might show something
like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pthread internal error: message:
__libc_reinit() failed, file: ../pthreads/pthread.c, line:
1096 Return Pointer is 0xc082bf33 sh: 5345
Quit(coredump)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and Configure will give up.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NFS filesystems and utime(2) on
HP-UX <br>
If you are compiling Perl on a remotely-mounted NFS
filesystem, the test io/fs.t may fail on test #18. This
appears to be a bug in HP-UX and no fix is currently
available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HP-UX Kernel Parameters
(maxdsiz) for Compiling Perl <br>
By default, HP-UX comes configured with a maximum data
segment size of 64MB. This is too small to correctly compile
Perl with the maximum optimization levels. You can increase
<br>
the size of the maxdsiz kernel parameter through the use of
SAM.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When using the GUI version of
SAM, click on the Kernel Configuration icon, then the
Configurable Parameters icon. Scroll down and select the
maxdsiz line. From the Actions <br>
menu, select the Modify Configurable Parameter item. Insert
the new formula into the Formula/Value box. Then follow the
instructions to rebuild your kernel and reboot your <br>
system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In general, a value of 256MB (or
&quot;256*1024*1024&quot;) is sufficient for Perl to compile
at maximum optimization.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nss_delete core dump from
op/pwent or op/grent <br>
You may get a bus error core dump from the op/pwent or
op/grent tests. If compiled with -g you will see a stack
trace much like the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#0 0xc004216c in () from
/usr/lib/libc.2 <br>
#1 0xc00d7550 in __nss_src_state_destr () from

#2 0xc00d7768 in __nss_src_state_destr () from
/usr/lib/libc.2 <br>
#3 0xc00d78a8 in nss_delete () from /usr/lib/libc.2 <br>

#8 0x23428 in perl_run () from ./perl <br>
#9 0x2005c in main () from ./perl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The key here is the
&quot;nss_delete&quot; call. One workaround for this bug
seems to be to create add to the file /etc/nsswitch.conf (at
least) the following lines</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">group: files <br>
