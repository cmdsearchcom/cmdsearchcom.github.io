perlhpux - Perl version 5 on Hewlett-Packard Unix (HP-UX) systems
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
This document describes various features of HP's Unix operating system (HP-UX)
  that will affect how Perl version 5 (hereafter just Perl) is compiled and/or
  runs.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Using_perl_as_shipped_with_HP-UX"><a class="selflink" href="#Using_perl_as_shipped_with_HP-UX">Using
  perl as shipped with HP-UX</a></h2>
Application release September 2001, HP-UX 11.00 is the first to ship with Perl.
  By the time it was perl-5.6.1 in /opt/perl. The first occurrence is on CD
  5012-7954 and can be installed using
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  swinstall -s /cdrom perl
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
assuming you have mounted that CD on /cdrom. In this version the following
  modules were installed:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  ActivePerl::DocTools-0.04   HTML::Parser-3.19   XML::DOM-1.25
  Archive::Tar-0.072          HTML::Tagset-3.03   XML::Parser-2.27
  Compress::Zlib-1.08         MIME::Base64-2.11   XML::Simple-1.05
  Convert::ASN1-0.10          Net-1.07            XML::XPath-1.09
  Digest::MD5-2.11            PPM-2.1.5           XML::XSLT-0.32
  File::CounterFile-0.12      SOAP::Lite-0.46     libwww-perl-5.51
  Font::AFM-1.18              Storable-1.011      libxml-perl-0.07
  HTML-Tree-3.11              URI-1.11            perl-ldap-0.23
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
That build was a portable hppa-1.1 multithread build that supports large files
  compiled with gcc-2.9-hppa-991112.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you perform a new installation, then (a newer) Perl will be installed
  automatically. Preinstalled HP-UX systems now slao have more recent versions
  of Perl and the updated modules.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The official (threaded) builds from HP, as they are shipped on the Application
  DVD/CD's are available on
  &lt;http://www.software.hp.com/portal/swdepot/displayProductInfo.do?productNumber=PERL&gt;
  for both PA-RISC and IPF (Itanium Processor Family). They are built with the
  HP ANSI-C compiler. Up till 5.8.8 that was done by ActiveState.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To see what version is included on the DVD (assumed here to be mounted on
  /cdrom), issue this command:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  # swlist -s /cdrom perl
  # perl           D.5.8.8.B  5.8.8 Perl Programming Language

  perl from HP's porting centre</a></h2>
HP porting centre tries very hard to keep up with customer demand and release
  updates from the Open Source community. Having precompiled Perl binaries
  available is obvious.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The HP porting centres are limited in what systems they are allowed to port to
  and they usually choose the two most recent OS versions available. This means
  that at the moment of writing, there are only HP-UX 11.11 (pa-risc 2.0) and
  HP-UX 11.23 (Itanium 2) ports available on the porting centres.
<div class="Pp"></div>
HP has asked the porting centre to move Open Source binaries from /opt to
  /usr/local, so binaries produced since the start of July 2002 are located in
  /usr/local.
<div class="Pp"></div>
One of HP porting centres URL's is &lt;http://hpux.connect.org.uk/&gt; The port
  currently available is built with GNU gcc.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Compiling_Perl_5_on_HP-UX"><a class="selflink" href="#Compiling_Perl_5_on_HP-UX">Compiling
  Perl 5 on HP-UX</a></h2>
When compiling Perl, you must use an ANSI C compiler. The C compiler that ships
  with all HP-UX systems is a K&amp;R compiler that should only be used to build
  new kernels.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Perl can be compiled with either HP's ANSI C compiler or with gcc. The former is
  recommended, as not only can it compile Perl with no difficulty, but also can
  take advantage of features listed later that require the use of HP
  compiler-specific command-line flags.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you decide to use gcc, make sure your installation is recent and complete,
  and be sure to read the Perl INSTALL file for more gcc-specific details.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="PA-RISC"><a class="selflink" href="#PA-RISC">PA-RISC</a></h2>
HP's HP9000 Unix systems run on HP's own Precision Architecture (PA-RISC) chip.
  HP-UX used to run on the Motorola MC68000 family of chips, but any machine
  with this chip in it is quite obsolete and this document will not attempt to
  address issues for compiling Perl on the Motorola chipset.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The version of PA-RISC at the time of this document's last update is 2.0, which
  is also the last there will be. HP PA-RISC systems are usually refered to with
  model description &quot;HP 9000&quot;. The last CPU in this series is the
  PA-8900. Support for PA-RISC architectured machines officially ends as shown
  in the following table:

An executable compiled on a PA-RISC 2.0 platform will not execute on a PA-RISC
  1.1 platform, even if they are running the same version of HP-UX. If you are
  building Perl on a PA-RISC 2.0 platform and want that Perl to also run on a
  PA-RISC 1.1, the compiler flags +DAportable and +DS32 should be used.
<div class="Pp"></div>
It is no longer possible to compile PA-RISC 1.0 executables on either the
  PA-RISC 1.1 or 2.0 platforms. The command-line flags are accepted, but the
  resulting executable will not run when transferred to a PA-RISC 1.0 system.

HP-UX also runs on the new Itanium processor. This requires the use of a
  different version of HP-UX (currently 11.23 or 11i v2), and with the exception
  of a few differences detailed below and in later sections, Perl should compile
  with no problems.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Although PA-RISC binaries can run on Itanium systems, you should not attempt to
  use a PA-RISC version of Perl on an Itanium system. This is because shared

<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Building_Dynamic_Extensions_on_HP-UX"><a class="selflink" href="#Building_Dynamic_Extensions_on_HP-UX">Building
  Dynamic Extensions on HP-UX</a></h2>
HP-UX supports dynamically loadable libraries (shared libraries). Shared
  libraries end with the suffix .sl. On Itanium systems, they end with the
  suffix .so.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Shared libraries created on a platform using a particular PA-RISC version are
  not usable on platforms using an earlier PA-RISC version by default. However,
  this backwards compatibility may be enabled using the same +DAportable
  compiler flag (with the same PA-RISC 1.0 caveat mentioned above).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Shared libraries created on an Itanium platform cannot be loaded on a PA-RISC
  platform. Shared libraries created on a PA-RISC platform can only be loaded on
  an Itanium platform if it is a PA-RISC executable that is attempting to load
  the PA-RISC library. A PA-RISC shared library cannot be loaded into an Itanium
  executable nor vice-versa.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To create a shared library, the following steps must be performed:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  1. Compile source modules with +z or +Z flag to create a .o module
     which contains Position-Independent Code (PIC).  The linker will
     tell you in the next step if +Z was needed.
     (For gcc, the appropriate flag is -fpic or -fPIC.)
  2. Link the shared library using the -b flag.  If the code calls
     any functions in other system libraries (e.g., libm), it must
     be included on this line.
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
(Note that these steps are usually handled automatically by the extension's
  Makefile).
<div class="Pp"></div>
If these dependent libraries are not listed at shared library creation time, you
  will get fatal &quot;Unresolved symbol&quot; errors at run time when the
  library is loaded.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You may create a shared library that refers to another library, which may be
  either an archive library or a shared library. If this second library is a
  shared library, this is called a &quot;dependent library&quot;. The dependent
  library's name is recorded in the main shared library, but it is not linked
  into the shared library. Instead, it is loaded when the main shared library is
  loaded. This can cause problems if you build an extension on one system and
  move it to another system where the libraries may not be located in the same
  place as on the first system.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the referred library is an archive library, then it is treated as a simple
  collection of .o modules (all of which must contain PIC). These modules are
  then linked into the shared library.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that it is okay to create a library which contains a dependent library that
  is already linked into perl.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Some extensions, like DB_File and Compress::Zlib use/require prebuilt libraries
  for the perl extensions/modules to work. If these libraries are built using
  the default configuration, it might happen that you run into an error like
  &quot;invalid loader fixup&quot; during load phase. HP is aware of this
  problem. Search the HP-UX cxx-dev forums for discussions about the subject.
  The short answer is that <b>everything</b> (all libraries, everything) must be
  compiled with &quot;+z&quot; or &quot;+Z&quot; to be PIC (position independent
  code). (For gcc, that would be &quot;-fpic&quot; or &quot;-fPIC&quot;). In
  HP-UX 11.00 or newer the linker error message should tell the name of the
  offending object file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A more general approach is to intervene manually, as with an example for the
  DB_File module, which requires SleepyCat's libdb.sl:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  # cd .../db-3.2.9/build_unix
  # vi Makefile
  ... add +Z to all cflags to create shared objects
  CFLAGS=         -c $(CPPFLAGS) +Z -Ae +O2 +Onolimit \
                  -I/usr/local/include -I/usr/include/X11R6
  CXXFLAGS=       -c $(CPPFLAGS) +Z -Ae +O2 +Onolimit \
                  -I/usr/local/include -I/usr/include/X11R6
  # make clean
  # make
  # mkdir tmp
  # cd tmp
  # ar x ../libdb.a
  # ld -b -o libdb-3.2.sl *.o
  # mv libdb-3.2.sl /usr/local/lib
  # rm *.o
  # cd /usr/local/lib
  # rm -f libdb.sl
  # ln -s libdb-3.2.sl libdb.sl
  # cd .../DB_File-1.76
  # make distclean
  # perl Makefile.PL
  # make
  # make test
  # make install
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
As of db-4.2.x it is no longer needed to do this by hand. Sleepycat has changed
  the configuration process to add +z on HP-UX automatically.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  # cd .../db-4.2.25/build_unix

<div class="Pp"></div>
It is no longer possible to link PA-RISC 1.0 shared libraries (even though the
  command-line flags are still present).
<div class="Pp"></div>
PA-RISC and Itanium object files are not interchangeable. Although you may be
  able to use ar to create an archive library of PA-RISC object files on an
  Itanium system, you cannot link against it using an Itanium link editor.

  HP ANSI C Compiler</a></h2>
When using this compiler to build Perl, you should make sure that the flag -Aa
  is added to the cpprun and cppstdin variables in the config.sh file (though
  see the section on 64-bit perl below). If you are using a recent version of
  the Perl distribution, these flags are set automatically.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Even though HP-UX 10.20 and 11.00 are not actively maintained by HP anymore,
  updates for the HP ANSI C compiler are still available from time to time, and
  it might be advisable to see if updates are applicable. At the moment of
  writing, the latests available patches for 11.00 that should be applied are
  PHSS_35098, PHSS_35175, PHSS_35100, PHSS_33036, and PHSS_33902). If you have a
  SUM account, you can use it to search for updates/patches. Enter
  &quot;ANSI&quot; as keyword.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="The_GNU_C_Compiler"><a class="selflink" href="#The_GNU_C_Compiler">The
  GNU C Compiler</a></h2>
When you are going to use the GNU C compiler (gcc), and you don't have gcc yet,
  you can either build it yourself from the sources (available from e.g.
  &lt;http://gcc.gnu.org/mirrors.html&gt;) or fetch a prebuilt binary from the
  HP porting center. gcc prebuilds can be fetched from
  &lt;http://h21007.www2.hp.com/dspp/tech/tech_TechSoftwareDetailPage_IDX/1,1703,547,00.html&gt;
  (Browse through the list, because there are often multiple versions of the
  same package available).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Above mentioned distributions are depots. H.Merijn Brand has made prebuilt gcc
  binaries available on &lt;http://mirrors.develooper.com/hpux/&gt; and/or
  &lt;http://www.cmve.net/~merijn/&gt; for HP-UX 10.20, HP-UX 11.00, HP-UX 11.11
  (HP-UX 11i v1), and HP-UX 11.23 (HP-UX 11i v2) in both 32- and 64-bit
  versions. These are bzipped tar archives that also include recent GNU binutils
  and GNU gdb. Read the instructions on that page to rebuild gcc using itself.
<div class="Pp"></div>
On PA-RISC you need a different compiler for 32-bit applications and for 64-bit
  applications. On PA-RISC, 32-bit objects and 64-bit objects do not mix.
  Period. There is no different behaviour for HP C-ANSI-C or GNU gcc. So if you
  require your perl binary to use 64-bit libraries, like Oracle-64bit, you MUST
  build a 64-bit perl.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Building a 64-bit capable gcc on PA-RISC from source is possible only when you
  have the HP C-ANSI C compiler or an already working 64-bit binary of gcc
  available. Best performance for perl is achieved with HP's native compiler.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Using_Large_Files_with_Perl_on_HP-UX"><a class="selflink" href="#Using_Large_Files_with_Perl_on_HP-UX">Using
  Large Files with Perl on HP-UX</a></h2>
Beginning with HP-UX version 10.20, files larger than 2GB (2^31 bytes) may be
  created and manipulated. Three separate methods of doing this are available.
  Of these methods, the best method for Perl is to compile using the
  -Duselargefiles flag to Configure. This causes Perl to be compiled using
  structures and functions in which these are 64 bits wide, rather than 32 bits
  wide. (Note that this will only work with HP's ANSI C compiler. If you want to
  compile Perl using gcc, you will have to get a version of the compiler that
  supports 64-bit operations. See above for where to find it.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
There are some drawbacks to this approach. One is that any extension which calls
  any file-manipulating C function will need to be recompiled (just follow the
  usual &quot;perl Makefile.PL; make; make test; make install&quot; procedure).
<div class="Pp"></div>
The list of functions that will need to recompiled is:
<br/>
 creat, fgetpos, fopen,
<br/>
 freopen, fsetpos, fstat,
<br/>
 fstatvfs, fstatvfsdev, ftruncate,
<br/>
 ftw, lockf, lseek,
<br/>
 lstat, mmap, nftw,
<br/>
 open, prealloc, stat,
<br/>
 statvfs, statvfsdev, tmpfile,
<br/>
 truncate, getrlimit, setrlimit
<div class="Pp"></div>
Another drawback is only valid for Perl versions before 5.6.0. This drawback is
  that the seek and tell functions (both the builtin version and POSIX module
  version) will not perform correctly.
<div class="Pp"></div>
It is strongly recommended that you use this flag when you run Configure. If you
  do not do this, but later answer the question about large files when Configure
  asks you, you may get a configuration that cannot be compiled, or that does
  not function as expected.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Threaded_Perl_on_HP-UX"><a class="selflink" href="#Threaded_Perl_on_HP-UX">Threaded
  Perl on HP-UX</a></h2>
It is possible to compile a version of threaded Perl on any version of HP-UX
  before 10.30, but it is strongly suggested that you be running on HP-UX 11.00
  at least.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To compile Perl with threads, add -Dusethreads to the arguments of Configure.
  Verify that the -D_POSIX_C_SOURCE=199506L compiler flag is automatically added
  to the list of flags. Also make sure that -lpthread is listed before -lc in
  the list of libraries to link Perl with. The hints provided for HP-UX during
  Configure will try very hard to get this right for you.
<div class="Pp"></div>
HP-UX versions before 10.30 require a separate installation of a POSIX threads
  library package. Two examples are the HP DCE package, available on &quot;HP-UX
  Hardware Extensions 3.0, Install and Core OS, Release 10.20, April 1999
  (B3920-13941)&quot; or the Freely available PTH package, available on
  H.Merijn's site (&lt;http://mirrors.develooper.com/hpux/&gt;). The use of PTH
  will be unsupported in perl-5.12 and up and is rather buggy in 5.11.x.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you are going to use the HP DCE package, the library used for threading is
  /usr/lib/libcma.sl, but there have been multiple updates of that library over
  time. Perl will build with the first version, but it will not pass the test
  suite. Older Oracle versions might be a compelling reason not to update that
  library, otherwise please find a newer version in one of the following
  patches: PHSS_19739, PHSS_20608, or PHSS_23672

For building perl to support Oracle, it needs to be linked with libcl and
  libpthread. So even if your perl is an unthreaded build, these libraries might
  be required. See &quot;Oracle on HP-UX&quot; below.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="64-bit_Perl_on_HP-UX"><a class="selflink" href="#64-bit_Perl_on_HP-UX">64-bit
  Perl on HP-UX</a></h2>
Beginning with HP-UX 11.00, programs compiled under HP-UX can take advantage of
  the LP64 programming environment (LP64 means Longs and Pointers are 64 bits
  wide), in which scalar variables will be able to hold numbers larger than 2^32
  with complete precision. Perl has proven to be consistent and reliable in
  64bit mode since 5.8.1 on all HP-UX 11.xx.
<div class="Pp"></div>
As of the date of this document, Perl is fully 64-bit compliant on HP-UX 11.00
  and up for both cc- and gcc builds. If you are about to build a 64-bit perl
  with GNU gcc, please read the gcc section carefully.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Should a user have the need for compiling Perl in the LP64 environment, use the
  -Duse64bitall flag to Configure. This will force Perl to be compiled in a pure
  LP64 environment (with the +DD64 flag for HP C-ANSI-C, with no additional
  options for GNU gcc 64-bit on PA-RISC, and with -mlp64 for GNU gcc on
  Itanium). If you want to compile Perl using gcc, you will have to get a
  version of the compiler that supports 64-bit operations.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can also use the -Duse64bitint flag to Configure. Although there are some
  minor differences between compiling Perl with this flag versus the
  -Duse64bitall flag, they should not be noticeable from a Perl user's
  perspective. When configuring -Duse64bitint using a 64bit gcc on a pa-risc
  architecture, -Duse64bitint is silently promoted to -Duse64bitall.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In both cases, it is strongly recommended that you use these flags when you run
  Configure. If you do not use do this, but later answer the questions about
  64-bit numbers when Configure asks you, you may get a configuration that
  cannot be compiled, or that does not function as expected.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Oracle_on_HP-UX"><a class="selflink" href="#Oracle_on_HP-UX">Oracle
  on HP-UX</a></h2>
Using perl to connect to Oracle databases through DBI and DBD::Oracle has caused
  a lot of people many headaches. Read README.hpux in the DBD::Oracle for much
  more information. The reason to mention it here is that Oracle requires a perl
  built with libcl and libpthread, the latter even when perl is build without
  threads. Building perl using all defaults, but still enabling to build
  DBD::Oracle later on can be achieved using
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  Configure -A prepend:libswanted='cl pthread ' ...
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Do not forget the space before the trailing quote.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Also note that this does not (yet) work with all configurations, it is known to
  fail with 64-bit versions of GCC.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="GDBM_and_Threads_on_HP-UX"><a class="selflink" href="#GDBM_and_Threads_on_HP-UX">GDBM
  and Threads on HP-UX</a></h2>
If you attempt to compile Perl with (POSIX) threads on an 11.X system and also
  link in the GDBM library, then Perl will immediately core dump when it starts
  up. The only workaround at this point is to relink the GDBM library under
  11.X, then relink it into Perl.
<div class="Pp"></div>
the error might show something like:
<div class="Pp"></div>
Pthread internal error: message: _ <i>_libc_reinit()</i> failed, file:
  ../pthreads/pthread.c, line: 1096 Return Pointer is 0xc082bf33 sh: 5345
  Quit(coredump)
<div class="Pp"></div>
and Configure will give up.

  filesystems and <i>utime</i>(2) on HP-UX</a></h2>
If you are compiling Perl on a remotely-mounted NFS filesystem, the test io/fs.t
  may fail on test #18. This appears to be a bug in HP-UX and no fix is
  currently available.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="HP-UX_Kernel_Parameters_(maxdsiz)_for_Compiling_Perl"><a class="selflink" href="#HP-UX_Kernel_Parameters_(maxdsiz)_for_Compiling_Perl">HP-UX
  Kernel Parameters (maxdsiz) for Compiling Perl</a></h2>
By default, HP-UX comes configured with a maximum data segment size of 64MB.
  This is too small to correctly compile Perl with the maximum optimization
  levels. You can increase the size of the maxdsiz kernel parameter through the
  use of SAM.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When using the GUI version of SAM, click on the Kernel Configuration icon, then
  the Configurable Parameters icon. Scroll down and select the maxdsiz line.
  From the Actions menu, select the Modify Configurable Parameter item. Insert
  the new formula into the Formula/Value box. Then follow the instructions to
  rebuild your kernel and reboot your system.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In general, a value of 256MB (or &quot;256*1024*1024&quot;) is sufficient for
  Perl to compile at maximum optimization.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="nss_delete_core_dump_from_op/pwent_or_op/grent"><a class="selflink" href="#nss_delete_core_dump_from_op/pwent_or_op/grent">nss_delete
  core dump from op/pwent or op/grent</a></h1>
You may get a bus error core dump from the op/pwent or op/grent tests. If
  compiled with -g you will see a stack trace much like the following:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  #0  0xc004216c in  () from /usr/lib/libc.2
  #1  0xc00d7550 in __nss_src_state_destr () from /usr/lib/libc.2

  #8  0x23428 in perl_run () from ./perl
  #9  0x2005c in main () from ./perl
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The key here is the &quot;nss_delete&quot; call. One workaround for this bug
  seems to be to create add to the file <i>/etc/nsswitch.conf</i> (at least) the
  following lines
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  group: files
  passwd: files
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Whether you are using NIS does not matter. Amazingly enough, the same bug also
  affects Solaris.

  token</a></h1>
There seems to be a broken system header file in HP-UX 11.00 that breaks perl
  building in 32bit mode with GNU gcc-4.x causing this error. The same file for
  HP-UX 11.11 (even though the file is older) does not show this failure, and
  has the correct definition, so the best fix is to patch the header to match:
