<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
ncwa averages variables in a single file over arbitrary
dimensions, with options to specify weights, masks, and
normalization. The default behavior of ncwa is to
arithmetically <br>
average every numerical variable over all dimensions and
produce a scalar result. To average variables over only a
subset of their dimensions, specify these dimensions in a
<br>
comma-separated list following -a, e.g., -a time,lat,lon. As
with all arithmetic operators, the operation may be
restricted to an arbitrary hypserslab by employing the -d
option <br>
ncwa also handles values matching the variable&rsquo;s
_FillValue attribute correctly. Moreover, ncwa understands
how to manipulate user-specified weights, masks, and
normalization <br>
options. With these options, ncwa can compute sophisticated
averages (and integrals) from the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mask and weight, if specified,
are broadcast to conform to the variables being averaged.
The rank of variables is reduced by the number of dimensions
which they are averaged <br>
over. Thus arrays which are one dimensional in the
input-file and are averaged by ncwa appear in the
output-file as scalars. This allows the user to infer which
dimensions may <br>
have been averaged. Note that that it is impossible for ncwa
to make make a weight or mask of rank W conform to a var of
rank V if W &gt; V. This situation often arises when
coor&acirc; <br>
dinate variables (which, by definition, are one dimensional)
are weighted and averaged. ncwa assumes you know this is
impossible and so ncwa does not attempt to broadcast weight
<br>
or mask to conform to var in this case, nor does ncwa print
a warning message telling you this, because it is so common.
Specifying dbg &gt; 2 does cause ncwa to emit warnings in
<br>
these situations, however.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Non-coordinate variables are
always masked and weighted if specified. Coordinate
variables, however, may be treated specially. By default, an
averaged coordinate variable, <br>
e.g., latitude, appears in output-file averaged the same way
as any other variable containing an averaged dimension. In
other words, by default ncwa weights and masks coordinate
<br>
variables like all other variables. This design decision was
intended to be helpful but for some applications it may be
preferable not to weight or mask coordinate variables <br>
just like all other variables. Consider the following
arguments to ncwa: &acirc;-a latitude -w lat_wgt -d
latitude,0.,90.&acirc; where lat_wgt is a weight in the
latitude dimension. Since, <br>
by default ncwa weights coordinate variables, the value of
latitude in the output-file depends on the weights in
lat_wgt and is not likely to be 45.---the midpoint latitude
of <br>
the hyperslab. Option -I overrides this default behavior and
causes ncwa not to weight or mask coordinate variables. In
the above case, this causes the value of latitude in the
<br>
output-file to be 45.---which is a somewhat appealing
result. Thus, -I specifies simple arithmetic averages for
the coordinate variables. In the case of latitude, -I
specifies <br>
that you prefer to archive the central latitude of the
hyperslab over which variables were averaged rather than the
area weighted centroid of the hyperslab. Note that the <br>
default behavior of ( -I) changed on 1998/12/01---before
this date the default was not to weight or mask coordinate
variables. The mathematical definition of operations
involv&acirc; <br>
ing rank reduction is given above.</p>
