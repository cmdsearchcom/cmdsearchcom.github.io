wnb - WordNet window-based browser interface
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<b>wnb</b>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>wnb()</b> provides a window-based interface for browsing the WordNet
  database, allowing synsets and relations to be displayed as formatted text.
  For each search word, different searches are available based on syntactic
  category and information available in the database.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>wnb</b> is written in Tcl/Tk, which is available for Unix and Windows
  platforms. This allows the same code to work on all supported WordNet
  platforms without modification.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="WNB_WINDOWS"><a class="selflink" href="#WNB_WINDOWS">WNB
  WINDOWS</a></h1>
<b>wnb()</b> was developed with the philosophy that only those searches and
  buttons that are applicable at the current time are displayed. As a result,
  the appearance of the interface changes as it is used. Use the standard
  windowing system mouse functions to open and close the WordNet Browser Window,
  move the window, and change its size.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The WordNet Browser Window contains the following areas, from top to bottom:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">Menubar</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">A menubar runs along the top of the browser window with
      pulldown menus and button entitled <b>File</b>, <b>History</b>,
      <b>Options</b>, and <b>Help</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">Search Word Entry</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Below the Menubar is a line for entering the search word. A
      search word can be a single word, hyphenated string, or a collocation.
      Case is ignored. Although only uninflected forms of words are usually
      stored in WordNet, users may search for inflected forms. WordNet's
      morphological processor finds the base form automatically.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">Search Selection</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Below the Search Word Entry line is an area for selecting
      the search type and senses to search. Until a search word is entered this
      area is blank. After a search word is entered, buttons appear
      corresponding to each syntactic category ( <b>Noun</b>, <b>Verb</b>,
      <b>Adjective</b>, <b>Adverb</b>) in which the search string is defined in
      WordNet.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    At the right edge of the Search Selection line is a box for entering sense
      numbers. When this box is empty, search results for all senses of the
      search word that match the search type are displayed. The search may be
      restricted to one or more specific senses by entering a comma or space
      separated list of sense numbers in the <b>Senses</b> box. These sense
      numbers remain in effect until either the user changes or deletes them, or
      a new search word is entered.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">Results Window</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Most of the browser window consists of a large text buffer
      for displaying the results of WordNet searches. Horizontal and vertical
      scroll bars are present for scrolling through the output.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">Status Line</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">A status line is at the bottom of the browser window. When
      search results are displayed in the Results Window, this status line
      reflects the type of search selected. When there is no search word
      entered, your are prompted to <b>&quot;Enter search word and press</b>
      <b>return.&quot;</b> If the search word entered is not in WordNet, the
      message <b>&quot;Sorry, no matches found.&quot;</b> is displayed.</dd>
</dl>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SEARCHING_THE_DATABASE"><a class="selflink" href="#SEARCHING_THE_DATABASE">SEARCHING
  THE DATABASE</a></h1>
The WordNet browser navigates through WordNet in two steps. First a search word
  is entered and an overview of all the senses of the word in all syntactic
  categories is displayed in the Results Window. The senses are grouped by
  syntactic category, and each synset is annotated as described above with
  <i>synset_offset</i>, <i>lex_filename</i>, and <i>sense_number</i> as dictated
  by the advanced search options set. The overview search also indicates how
  many of the senses in each syntactic category are represented in the tagged
  texts. This is a way for the user to determine whether a sense's sense number
  is based on semantic tagging data, or was arbitrarily assigned. For each sense
  that has appeared in such texts, the number of semantic tags to that sense are
  indicated in parentheses after the sense number.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Then, within a syntactic category, a specific search is selected. The desired
  search is performed and the search results are displayed in the Results
  Window. Additional searches on the same word can be performed, or a new search
  word can be entered.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
To enter a search word, click the mouse in the horizontal box labeled <b>Search
  Word</b>, type a single word, hyphenated string, or collocation and press
  <small><b>RETURN.</b></small>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>wnb()</b> responds by making a set of Part of Speech buttons appear in the
  Search Selection line. Each button corresponds to a syntactic category in
  which the search string is defined in WordNet. At the same time, an Overview
  of the synsets for all senses of the search word is displayed in the Results
  Window. The Overview includes the gloss for each synset and also indicates
  which of the senses have appeared in the semantically tagged texts. For each
  sense that has appeared in such texts, the number of semantic tags to that
  sense are indicated in parentheses after the sense number.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The pulldown menus in the Search Selection line list all of the WordNet searches
  that can be performed for the search word in that part of speech. To select a
  search, highlight it by dragging the mouse to it, and release the mouse while
  it is highlighted. Drag the mouse outside of the pulldown list and release to
  hide the menu without making a selection. Dragging the mouse across the Part
  of Speech buttons displays the available searches for each syntactic category.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
To restrict a search to one or more senses within a syntactic category, enter a
  comma or space separated list of sense numbers in the <b>Senses</b> box before
  selecting a search.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
After a search is selected, <b>wnb()</b> performs the search on the WordNet
  database and displays the formatted results in the Results Window. Whenever
  search results are displayed, a button entitled <b>Redisplay Overview</b> is
  present at the right edge of the Search Word Entry line. Clicking on this
  button redisplays the Overview of all synsets for the search word in the
  Results Window.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Changing_the_Search_Word"><a class="selflink" href="#Changing_the_Search_Word">Changing
  the Search Word</a></h2>
A new search word can be entered at any time by moving to the Search Word Entry
  box, if necessary highlighting it by clicking, erasing the old string, typing
  a new one and pressing <small><b>RETURN.</b></small> The <b>Senses</b> box is
  cleared if necessary, the Part of Speech buttons applicable to the new search
  word appear, and the Overview for the new search word is displayed.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The middle mouse button can also be used to select a new search word by placing
  the mouse over any word in the Results Window and clicking. The selected word
  will replace the text in the Search Word Entry box, and the overview for that
  word will automatically be displayed.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
To select a new search string collocation from text in the Results Window,
  highlight the text with the mouse and press <small><b>CONTROL-S.</b></small>

<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Interrupting_a_Search"><a class="selflink" href="#Interrupting_a_Search">Interrupting
  a Search</a></h2>
When a search is in progress the message <b>&quot;Searching...(press escape</b>
  <b>to abort)&quot;</b> is displayed in the Status Line. Note that most
  searches return very quickly, so this message isn't noticeable. As indicated,
  pressing the <small><b>ESCAPE</b></small> key will interrupt the search. The
  results of the search obtained before the time the search was interrupted are
  displayed in the Results Window.

  <dd class="It-tag">Display a popup window for specifying a search of WordNet
      for words or collocations that contain a specific substring. If a search
      word is currently entered in the <b>Search Word</b> box, it is used as the
      substring to search for by default. The Substring Search Window contains a
      box for entering a substring, a pulldown menu to its right for specifying
      the part of speech to search, a large area for displaying the search
      results, and action buttons at the bottom entitled <b>Search</b>,
      <b>Save</b>, <b>Print</b> <b>Dismiss</b>.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Once a substring is entered and a part of speech selected, clicking on the
      <b>Search</b> button causes a search to be done for all words and
      collocations in WordNet, in that syntactic category, that contain the
      substring according to the following criteria:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    1. The substring can appear at the beginning or end of a word, hyphenated
      string o collocation.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    2. The substring can appear in the middle of a hyphenated string or
      collocation, but only delimited on both sides by spaces or hyphens.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The search results are displayed in the large buffer. Clicking on an item

Clicking on any word in the Results Window while holding down the

  <b>Search</b> <b>Word</b> with the word and display its Overview and available
  searches. Clicking on any word in the Results Window with the middle mouse
  button does the same thing.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Pressing the <small><b>CONTROL-S</b></small> keys causes the browser to do as
  above on the text that is currently highlighted. Under Unix, this will work
  even if the highlighted text is in another window. This works on hyphenated
  strings and collocations, as well as individual words.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Pressing the <small><b>CONTROL-G</b></small> keys displays the Substring Search

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SEARCH_RESULTS"><a class="selflink" href="#SEARCH_RESULTS">SEARCH
  RESULTS</a></h1>
The results of a search of the WordNet database are displayed in the Results
  Window. Horizontal and vertical scroll bars are present for scrolling through
  the search results.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
All searches other than the Overview list all senses matching the search results
  in the following general format. Items enclosed in italicized square brackets
  ( <i>[ ... ]</i>) may not be present.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If a search cannot be performed on some senses of <i>searchstr</i>, the search
  results are headed by a string of the form:
<pre>
	X of Y senses of  <i>searchstr</i>
</pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">One line listing the number of senses matching
  the search selected.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Each sense matching the search selected displayed as follows:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
	 <b>Sense </b><i>n</i>
	 <i>[</i><b>{</b><i>synset_offset</i><b>}</b><i>] [</i><b>&lt;</b><i>lex_filename</i><b>&gt;</b><i>]  word1[</i><b>#</b><i>sense_number][,  word2...]</i>
</pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Where <i>n</i> is the sense number of the search word, <i>synset_offset</i> is
  the byte offset of the synset in the <b>data.</b><i>pos</i> file corresponding
  to the syntactic category, <i>lex_filename</i> is the name of the
  lexicographer file that the synset comes from, <i>word1</i> is the first word
  in the synset (note that this is not necessarily the search word) and
  <i>sense_number</i> is the WordNet sense number assigned to the preceding
  word. <i>synset_offset</i>, <i>lex_filename</i>, and <i>sense_number</i> are
  generated if the appropriate Options are specified.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The synsets matching the search selected are printed below each sense's synset
  output described above. Each line of output is preceded by a marker (usually
  <b>=&gt;</b>), then a synset, formatted as described above. If a search
  traverses more one level of the tree, then successive lines are indented by
  spaces corresponding to its level in the hierarchy. Glosses are displayed in
  parentheses at the end of each synset if the appropriate Option is set. Each
  synset is printed on one line.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Senses are ordered from most to least frequently used, with the most common
  sense numbered <b>1</b>. Frequency of use is determined by the number of times
  a sense is tagged in the various semantic concordance texts. Senses that are
  not semantically tagged follow the ordered senses. Note that this ordering is
  only an estimate based on usage in a small corpus.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Verb senses can be grouped by similarity of meaning, rather than ordered by
  frequency of use. When the <b>&quot;Synonyms, grouped by</b>
  <b>similarity&quot;</b> search is selected, senses that are close in meaning
  are printed together, with a line of dashes indicating the end of a group. See
  <b>wngroups</b>(7) for a discussion how senses are grouped.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The output of the <b>&quot;Derivationally Related Forms&quot;</b> search shows
  word forms that are morphologically related to <b>searchstr</b>. Each word
  form pointed to from <i>searchstr</i> is displayed, preceded by <b>RELATED
  TO-&gt;</b> and the syntactic category of the link, followed, on the next
  line, by its synset. Printed after the word form is <b>#</b><i>n</i> where
  <i>n</i> indicates the WordNet sense number of the term pointed to.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The <b>&quot;Domain&quot;</b> and <b>&quot;Domain Terms&quot;</b> searches show
  the domain that a synset has been classified in and, conversely, all of the
  terms that have been assigned to a specific domain. A domain is either a
  <b>TOPIC,</b> <b>REGION</b> or <b>USAGE,</b> as reflected in the specific
  pointer character stored in the database, and displayed in the output. A
  <b>Domain</b> search on a term shows the domain, if any, that each synset
  containing <i>searchstr</i> has been classified in. The output display shows
  the domain type ( <b>TOPIC,</b> <b>REGION</b> or <b>USAGE</b>), followed by
  the syntactic category of the domain synset and the terms in the synset. Each
  term is followed by <b>#</b><i>n</i> where <i>n</i> indicates the WordNet
  sense number of the term. The converse search, <b>Domain Terms</b>, shows all
  of the synsets that have been placed into the domain <i>searchstr</i>, with
  analogous markers.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
When the <b>&quot;Sentence Frames&quot;</b> search is specified, sample
  illustrative sentences and generic sentence frames are displayed. If a sample
  sentence is found, the base form of the search word is substituted into the
  sentence, and it is printed below the synset, preceded with the <b>EX:</b>
  marker. When no sample sentences are found, the generic sentence frames are
  displayed. Sentence frames that are acceptable for all words in a synset are
  preceded by the marker <b>*&gt;</b>. If a frame is acceptable for the search
  word only, it is preceded by the marker <b>=&gt;</b>.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Search results for adjectives are slightly different from those for other parts
  of speech. When an adjective is printed, its direct antonym, if it has one, is
  also printed in parentheses. When the search word is in a head synset, all of
  the head synset's satellites are also displayed. The position of an adjective
  in relation to the noun may be restricted to the <i>prenominal</i>,
  <i>postnominal</i> or <i>predicative</i> position. Where present, these
  restrictions are noted in parentheses.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
When an adjective is a participle of a verb, the output indicates the verb and
  displays its synset.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
When an adverb is derived from an adjective, the specific adjectival sense on
  which it is based is indicated.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The morphological transformations performed by the search code may result in
  more than one word to search for. <b>wnb()</b> automatically performs the
  requested search on all of the strings and returns the results grouped by
  word. For example, the verb <b>saw</b> is both the present tense of <b>saw</b>
  and the past tense of <b>see</b>. When there is more than one word to search
  for, search results are grouped by word.</div>
