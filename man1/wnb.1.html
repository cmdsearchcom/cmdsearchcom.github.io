<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
wnb - WordNet window-based browser interface</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
wnb</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
wnb() provides a window-based interface for browsing the
WordNet database, allowing synsets and relations to be
displayed as formatted text. For each search word, different
<br>
searches are available based on syntactic category and
information available in the database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wnb is written in Tcl/Tk, which
is available for Unix and Windows platforms. This allows the
same code to work on all supported WordNet platforms without
modification.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WNB WINDOWS <br>
wnb() was developed with the philosophy that only those
searches and buttons that are applicable at the current time
are displayed. As a result, the appearance of the interface
<br>
changes as it is used. Use the standard windowing system
mouse functions to open and close the WordNet Browser
Window, move the window, and change its size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The WordNet Browser Window
contains the following areas, from top to bottom:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Menubar A menubar runs along the
top of the browser window with pulldown menus and button
entitled File, History, Options, and Help.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Search Word Entry Below the
Menubar is a line for entering the search word. A search
word can be a single word, hyphenated string, or a
collocation. Case is ignored. <br>
Although only uninflected forms of words are usually stored
in WordNet, users may search for inflected forms.
WordNet&rsquo;s morphological processor finds the <br>
base form automatically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Search Selection Below the
Search Word Entry line is an area for selecting the search
type and senses to search. Until a search word is entered
this area is blank. After a <br>
search word is entered, buttons appear corresponding to each
syntactic category (Noun, Verb, Adjective, Adverb) in which
the search string is defined in Word&acirc; <br>
Net.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At the right edge of the Search
Selection line is a box for entering sense numbers. When
this box is empty, search results for all senses of the
search word <br>
that match the search type are displayed. The search may be
restricted to one or more specific senses by entering a
comma or space separated list of sense <br>
numbers in the Senses box. These sense numbers remain in
effect until either the user changes or deletes them, or a
new search word is entered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Results Window Most of the
browser window consists of a large text buffer for
displaying the results of WordNet searches. Horizontal and
vertical scroll bars are present <br>
for scrolling through the output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Status Line A status line is at
the bottom of the browser window. When search results are
displayed in the Results Window, this status line reflects
the type of search <br>
selected. When there is no search word entered, your are
prompted to &quot;Enter search word and press return.&quot;
If the search word entered is not in WordNet, the <br>
message &quot;Sorry, no matches found.&quot; is
displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEARCHING THE DATABASE <br>
The WordNet browser navigates through WordNet in two steps.
First a search word is entered and an overview of all the
senses of the word in all syntactic categories is displayed
<br>
in the Results Window. The senses are grouped by syntactic
category, and each synset is annotated as described above
with synset_offset, lex_filename, and sense_number as
dic&acirc; <br>
tated by the advanced search options set. The overview
search also indicates how many of the senses in each
syntactic category are represented in the tagged texts. This
is a <br>
way for the user to determine whether a sense&rsquo;s sense
number is based on semantic tagging data, or was arbitrarily
assigned. For each sense that has appeared in such texts,
the <br>
number of semantic tags to that sense are indicated in
parentheses after the sense number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Then, within a syntactic
category, a specific search is selected. The desired search
is performed and the search results are displayed in the
Results Window. Additional <br>
searches on the same word can be performed, or a new search
word can be entered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To enter a search word, click
the mouse in the horizontal box labeled Search Word, type a
single word, hyphenated string, or collocation and press
RETURN.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wnb() responds by making a set
of Part of Speech buttons appear in the Search Selection
line. Each button corresponds to a syntactic category in
which the search string is <br>
defined in WordNet. At the same time, an Overview of the
synsets for all senses of the search word is displayed in
the Results Window. The Overview includes the gloss for each
<br>
synset and also indicates which of the senses have appeared
in the semantically tagged texts. For each sense that has
appeared in such texts, the number of semantic tags to that
<br>
sense are indicated in parentheses after the sense
number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The pulldown menus in the Search
Selection line list all of the WordNet searches that can be
performed for the search word in that part of speech. To
select a search, highlight <br>
it by dragging the mouse to it, and release the mouse while
it is highlighted. Drag the mouse outside of the pulldown
list and release to hide the menu without making a
selec&acirc; <br>
tion. Dragging the mouse across the Part of Speech buttons
displays the available searches for each syntactic
category.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To restrict a search to one or
more senses within a syntactic category, enter a comma or
space separated list of sense numbers in the Senses box
before selecting a search.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After a search is selected,
wnb() performs the search on the WordNet database and
displays the formatted results in the Results Window.
Whenever search results are displayed, a <br>
button entitled Redisplay Overview is present at the right
edge of the Search Word Entry line. Clicking on this button
redisplays the Overview of all synsets for the search word
<br>
in the Results Window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Changing the Search Word <br>
A new search word can be entered at any time by moving to
the Search Word Entry box, if necessary highlighting it by
clicking, erasing the old string, typing a new one and
press&acirc; <br>
ing RETURN. The Senses box is cleared if necessary, the Part
of Speech buttons applicable to the new search word appear,
and the Overview for the new search word is displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The middle mouse button can also
be used to select a new search word by placing the mouse
over any word in the Results Window and clicking. The
selected word will replace the <br>
text in the Search Word Entry box, and the overview for that
word will automatically be displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To select a new search string
collocation from text in the Results Window, highlight the
text with the mouse and press CONTROL-S.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Interrupting a Search <br>
When a search is in progress the message
&quot;Searching...(press escape to abort)&quot; is displayed
in the Status Line. Note that most searches return very
quickly, so this message <br>
isn&rsquo;t noticeable. As indicated, pressing the ESCAPE
key will interrupt the search. The results of the search
obtained before the time the search was interrupted are
displayed <br>
in the Results Window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MENUS <br>
File Menu <br>
Find keywords by substring <br>
Display a popup window for specifying a search of WordNet
for words or collocations that contain a specific substring.
If a search word is currently entered in the <br>
Search Word box, it is used as the substring to search for
by default. The Substring Search Window contains a box for
entering a substring, a pulldown menu to its <br>
right for specifying the part of speech to search, a large
area for displaying the search results, and action buttons
at the bottom entitled Search, Save, Print <br>
Dismiss.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once a substring is entered and
a part of speech selected, clicking on the Search button
causes a search to be done for all words and collocations in
WordNet, in <br>
that syntactic category, that contain the substring
according to the following criteria:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. The substring can appear at
the beginning or end of a word, hyphenated string o
collocation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. The substring can appear in
the middle of a hyphenated string or collocation, but only
delimited on both sides by spaces or hyphens.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The search results are displayed
in the large buffer. Clicking on an item from the search
results list causes wnb() to automatically enter that word
in the Search <br>
Word box of the WordNet Browser Window and perform the
Overview search.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Clicking the Save button
generates a popup dialog for specifying a filename to save
the substring search results to. Clicking the Print button
generates a popup <br>
dialog in which a print command can be specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Selecting Dismiss closes the
Substring Search Window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Save current display <br>
Display a popup dialog for specifying a filename to save the
current Results Window contents to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Print current display <br>
Display a popup dialog in which to specify a print command
to which the current Results Window contents can be piped.
Note - this option does not exist in the Win&acirc; <br>
dows version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Clear current display <br>
Clear the Search Word and Senses boxes, and Results
Window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Exit Does what you would
expect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">History <br>
This pulldown menu contains a list of the last searches
performed. Selecting an item from this list performs that
search again. The maximum number of searches stored in the
<br>
list can be adjusted from the Options menu. The default is
10.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options <br>
Show help with each search <br>
When this checkbox is selected search results are preceded
by some explanatory text about the type of search selected.
This is off by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Show descriptive gloss <br>
When this checkbox is selected, synset glosses are displayed
in all search results. This is set by default. Note that
glosses are always displayed in the Over&acirc; <br>
view.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Wrap Lines <br>
When this checkbox is selected, lines in the Results Window
that are wider than the window are automatically wrapped.
This is set by default. If not selected, a <br>
horizontal scroll bar is present if any lines are longer
than the width of the window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Set advanced search options...
<br>
Selecting this item displays a popup window for setting the
following search options: Lexical file information; Synset
location in database file; Sense number. <br>
Choices for each are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Don&rsquo;t show (default) <br>
Show with searches <br>
Show with searches and overview</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When lexical file information is
shown, the name of the lexicographer file is printed before
each synset, enclosed in angle brackets (&lt; ... &gt;).
When both lexical <br>
file information and synset location information are
displayed, the synset location information appears first. If
within one lexicographer file more than one sense <br>
of a word is entered, an integer lex_id is appended onto all
but one of the word&rsquo;s instances to uniquely identify
it. In each synset, each word having a non-zero <br>
lex_id is printed with the lex_id value printed immediately
following the word. If both lexicographer information and
sense numbers are displayed, lex_ids, if <br>
present, precede sense numbers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When synset location is shown,
the byte offset of the synset in the database
&quot;data&quot; file corresponding to the syntactic
category of the synset is printed before <br>
each synset, enclosed in curly braces ({ ... }). When both
lexical file information and synset location information are
displayed, the synset location informa&acirc; <br>
tion appears first.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When sense numbers are shown,
the sense number of each word in each synset is printed
immediately after the word, and is preceded by a number sign
(#).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Set maximum history length...
<br>
Display a popup dialog in which the maximum number of
previous searches to be kept on the History list can be
set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Set font... <br>
Display a popup window for setting the font (typeface) and
font size to use for the Results Window. Choices for
typeface are: Courier, Helvetica, and Times <br>
(default). Font size can be small, medium (default), or
large.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Save current options as default

Information about this application.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SHORCUTS <br>
Clicking on any word in the Results Window while holding
down the SHIFT key on the keyboard causes the browser to
replace Search Word with the word and display its Overview
and <br>
available searches. Clicking on any word in the Results
Window with the middle mouse button does the same thing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pressing the CONTROL-S keys
causes the browser to do as above on the text that is
currently highlighted. Under Unix, this will work even if
the highlighted text is in another <br>
window. This works on hyphenated strings and collocations,
as well as individual words.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pressing the CONTROL-G keys
displays the Substring Search Window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEARCH RESULTS <br>
The results of a search of the WordNet database are
displayed in the Results Window. Horizontal and vertical
scroll bars are present for scrolling through the search
results.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All searches other than the
Overview list all senses matching the search results in the
following general format. Items enclosed in italicized
square brackets ([ ... ]) may not <br>
be present.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a search cannot be performed
on some senses of searchstr, the search results are headed
by a string of the form: <br>
X of Y senses of searchstr</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One line listing the number of
senses matching the search selected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each sense matching the search
selected displayed as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sense n <br>
[{synset_offset}] [&lt;lex_filename&gt;]
word1[#sense_number][, word2...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Where n is the sense number of
the search word, synset_offset is the byte offset of the
synset in the data.pos file corresponding to the syntactic
category, lex_filename <br>
is the name of the lexicographer file that the synset comes
from, word1 is the first word in the synset (note that this
is not necessarily the search word) and sense_num&acirc;
<br>
ber is the WordNet sense number assigned to the preceding
word. synset_offset, lex_filename, and sense_number are
generated if the appropriate Options are specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The synsets matching the search
selected are printed below each sense&rsquo;s synset output
described above. Each line of output is preceded by a marker
(usually =&gt;), then a <br>
synset, formatted as described above. If a search traverses
more one level of the tree, then successive lines are
indented by spaces corresponding to its level in the <br>
hierarchy. Glosses are displayed in parentheses at the end
of each synset if the appropriate Option is set. Each synset
is printed on one line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Senses are ordered from most to
least frequently used, with the most common sense numbered
1. Frequency of use is determined by the number of times a
sense is tagged in <br>
the various semantic concordance texts. Senses that are not
semantically tagged follow the ordered senses. Note that
this ordering is only an estimate based on usage in a <br>
small corpus.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Verb senses can be grouped by
similarity of meaning, rather than ordered by frequency of
use. When the &quot;Synonyms, grouped by similarity&quot;
search is selected, senses that <br>
are close in meaning are printed together, with a line of
dashes indicating the end of a group. See wngroups(7) for a
discussion how senses are grouped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The output of the
&quot;Derivationally Related Forms&quot; search shows word
forms that are morphologically related to searchstr. Each
word form pointed to from searchstr is dis&acirc; <br>
played, preceded by RELATED TO-&gt; and the syntactic
category of the link, followed, on the next line, by its
synset. Printed after the word form is #n where n indicates
<br>
the WordNet sense number of the term pointed to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;Domain&quot; and
&quot;Domain Terms&quot; searches show the domain that a
synset has been classified in and, conversely, all of the
terms that have been assigned to a specific <br>
domain. A domain is either a TOPIC, REGION or USAGE, as
reflected in the specific pointer character stored in the
database, and displayed in the output. A Domain search <br>
on a term shows the domain, if any, that each synset
containing searchstr has been classified in. The output
display shows the domain type (TOPIC, REGION or USAGE),
fol&acirc; <br>
lowed by the syntactic category of the domain synset and the
terms in the synset. Each term is followed by #n where n
indicates the WordNet sense number of the term. The <br>
converse search, Domain Terms, shows all of the synsets that
have been placed into the domain searchstr, with analogous
markers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the &quot;Sentence
Frames&quot; search is specified, sample illustrative
sentences and generic sentence frames are displayed. If a
sample sentence is found, the base form of <br>
the search word is substituted into the sentence, and it is
printed below the synset, preceded with the EX: marker. When
no sample sentences are found, the generic sen&acirc; <br>
tence frames are displayed. Sentence frames that are
acceptable for all words in a synset are preceded by the
marker *&gt;. If a frame is acceptable for the search word
<br>
only, it is preceded by the marker =&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Search results for adjectives
are slightly different from those for other parts of speech.
When an adjective is printed, its direct antonym, if it has
one, is also <br>
printed in parentheses. When the search word is in a head
synset, all of the head synset&rsquo;s satellites are also
displayed. The position of an adjective in relation to the
<br>
noun may be restricted to the prenominal, postnominal or
predicative position. Where present, these restrictions are
noted in parentheses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When an adjective is a
participle of a verb, the output indicates the verb and
displays its synset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When an adverb is derived from
an adjective, the specific adjectival sense on which it is
based is indicated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The morphological
transformations performed by the search code may result in
more than one word to search for. wnb() automatically
performs the requested search on all of <br>
the strings and returns the results grouped by word. For
example, the verb saw is both the present tense of saw and
the past tense of see. When there is more than one <br>
word to search for, search results are grouped by word.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
If the WordNet database files cannot be opened, error
messages are displayed. This is usually corrected by setting
the environment variables described below to the proper
