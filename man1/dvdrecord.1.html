<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>wodim</b> is used to record data or audio Compact Discs on an Orange Book
  CD-Recorder or to write DVD media on a DVD-Recorder.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <i>device</i> is the device file or label offered by the operating system to
  access the recorder with SCSI GENERIC (sg) interface. Note that some operating
  systems may provide separate device nodes for block-oriented and sg access.
  For example, on older <i>Linux</i> systems, the sg access was available
  through <i>/dev/sg...</i> files while the block oriented access was done
  through associated (but not identical) <i>/dev/hd...</i> and <i>/dev/sr...</i>
  (or <i>/dev/scd...</i> ) files.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In any case, the user running <b>wodim</b> needs read and write access to the
  particular device file on a Linux system. It is recommended to be root or
  install the application as suid-root, because certain versions of Linux
  (kernel) limit the set of SCSI commands allowed for non-root users. Even if
  usage without root identity is possible in many cases, some device drivers
  still may fail, show unexplainable problems and generally the problems become
  harder to debug. The risk for buffer-underruns is also increased. See the
  <i>PROCESS SCHEDULING PRIORITY</i> section below for more details.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There is an alternative way of specifying the device, using the traditional SCSI
  descriptions in form of <i>devicetype:bus/target/lun</i> specification.
  However, the success of this method is not guaranteed since it requires an
  adaptation scheme for your architecture, and the numbers may vary depending on
  the hardware-internal numbering or on the order of hot-plug device detection.
  If your operating system does not provide a sufficient framework for keeping
  this numbers persistent, don't rely on them. See <b>-scanbus</b> and
  <b>--devices</b> options below for details.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There are emulated SCSI compatible device systems, using the SCSI protocols
  transported over various hardware/media types. The most known examples is
  ATAPI (&quot;IDE burners&quot;) or USB storage (&quot;external USB
  case&quot;). If the pseudo-SCSI b/t/l device address specification is used
  instead of the native one, you need to prepend the &quot;devicetype:&quot;
  description to the emulated &quot;bus/target/lun&quot; device address.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If a file /etc/wodim.conf exists, the parameter to the <b>dev=</b> option may
  also be a drive name label in that file (see FILES section).
<div class="Pp"></div>
As a special exception, the device specification can be <i>-1</i> or just
  omitted, which invokes automatic guessing of an appropriate device for the
  selected operation. However, this guessing is not available everywhere and is
  not reliable; it is only available for the user's convenience in simple
  environments.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In <i>Track At Once</i> mode, each <i>track</i> corresponds to a single file
  that contains the prepared data for that track. If the argument is `<b>-</b>',
  standard input is used for that track. Only one track may be taken from
  <i>stdin</i>. In the other write modes, the direct file to track relation may
  not be implemented. In <b>-clone</b> mode, a single file contains all data for
  the whole disk. To allow DVD writing on platforms that do not implement large
  file support, <b>wodim</b> concatenates all file arguments to a single track
  when writing to DVD media.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="PROCESS_SCHEDULING_PRIORITY"><a class="selflink" href="#PROCESS_SCHEDULING_PRIORITY">PROCESS
  SCHEDULING PRIORITY</a></h1>
Wodim tries to get higher process priority using different methods. This is
  important because the burn process is usually a realtime task, no long delays
  should occur while transmitting fresh data to the recorder. This is especially
  important on systems with insufficient RAM where swapping can create delays of
  many seconds.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A possible workaround on underpowered systems is the use of the burnfree or
  similar feature, allowing the recorder to resume.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Root permissions are usually required to get higher process scheduling priority.
<div class="Pp"></div>
On <b>SVr4</b> compliant systems, <b>wodim</b> uses the real time class to get
  the highest scheduling priority that is possible (higher than all kernel
  processes). On systems with <b>POSIX real time scheduling</b> wodim uses real
  time scheduling too, but may not be able to gain a priority that is higher
  than all kernel processes.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In order to be able to use the SCSI transport subsystem of the OS, run at
  highest priority and lock itself into core <b>wodim</b> either needs to be run
  as root, needs to be installed suid root or must be called via <b>RBACs</b>
  pfexec mechanism.

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-immed</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Tell wodim to set the <b>SCSI IMMED</b> flag in certain
      commands (load/eject/blank/close_track/close_session). This can be useful
      on broken systems with ATAPI harddisk and CD/DVD writer on the same bus or
      with SCSI systems that don't use disconnect/reconnect. These systems will
      freeze while blanking or fixating a CD/DVD or while a DVD writer is
      filling up a session to the minimum amount (approx. 800 MB). Setting the
      <b>-immed</b> flag will request the command to return immediately while
      the operation proceeds in background, making the bus usable for the other
      devices and avoiding the system freeze. This is an experimental feature
      which may work or not, depending on the model of the CD/DVD writer. A
      correct solution would be to set up a correct cabling but there seem to be
      notebooks around that have been set up the wrong way by the manufacturer.
      As it is impossible to fix this problem in notebooks, the <b>-immed</b>
      option has been added.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    A second experimental feature of the <b>-immed</b> flag is to tell wodim to
      try to wait short times while writing to the media. This is expected to
      free the IDE bus if the CD/DVD writer and the data source are connected to
      the same IDE cable. In this case, the CD/DVD writer would otherwise
      usually block the IDE bus for nearly all the time making it impossible to
      fetch data from the source drive. See also <b>minbuf=</b> and <b>-v</b>
      option.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>

      option <b>-v</b> has been specified, <b>wodim</b> implies the verbose

      only implemented for DVD+RW media. A 'maiden' DVD+RW media needs to be
      formatted before you may write to it. However, as <b>wodim</b> autodetects

  <dt class="It-tag"><b>fs=</b>#</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Set the FIFO (ring buffer) size to #. You may use the same
      syntax as in <b>dd</b>(1), <b>sdd</b>(1) or <b>star</b>(1). The number
      representing the size is taken in bytes unless otherwise specified. If a
      number is followed directly by the letter `b', `k', `m', `s' or `f', the
      size is multiplied by 512, 1024, 1024*1024, 2048 or 2352. If the size
      consists of numbers separated by `x' or `*', multiplication of the two
      numbers is performed. Thus <i>fs=10x63k</i> will specify a FIFO size of
      630&#x00A0;kBytes.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The size specified by the <i>fs=</i> argument includes the shared memory
      that is needed for administration. This is at least one page of memory. If
      no <i>fs</i>= option is present, <b>wodim</b> will try to get the FIFO
      size value from the <b>CDR_FIFOSIZE</b> environment. The default FIFO size
      is currently 4 MB.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The FIFO is used to increase buffering for the real time writing process. It
      allows to run a pipe from <b>genisoimage</b> directly into <b>wodim</b>.
      If the FIFO is active and a pipe from <b>genisoimage</b> into <b>wodim</b>
      is used to create a CD, <b>wodim</b> will abort prior to do any
      modifications on the disk if <b>genisoimage</b> dies before it starts
      writing. The recommended FIFO size is between 4 and 128&#x00A0;MBytes. As
      a rule of thumb, the FIFO size should be at least equal to the size of the
      internal buffer of the CD/DVD-Recorder and no more than half of the
      physical amount of RAM available in the machine. If the FIFO size is big
      enough, the FIFO statistics will print a FIFO empty count of zero and the
      FIFO min fill is not below 20%. It is not wise to use too much space for
      the FIFO. If you need more than 8 MB to write a CD at a speed less than
      20x from an image on a local file system on an idle machine, your machine
      is either underpowered, has hardware problems or is mis-configured. If you
      like to write DVDs or CDs at higher speed, it makes sense to use at least
      16&#x00A0;MB for the FIFO.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    On old and small machines, you need to be more careful with the FIFO size.
      If your machine has less than 256&#x00A0;MB of physical RAM, you should
      not set up a FIFO size that is more than 32&#x00A0;MB. The sun4c
      architecture (e.g. a Sparcstation-2) has only MMU page table entries for
      16&#x00A0;MBytes per process. Using more than 14&#x00A0;MBytes for the
      FIFO may cause the operating system in this case to spend much time to
      constantly reload the MMU tables. Newer machines from Sun do not have this
      MMU hardware problem. I have no information on PC-hardware reflecting this
      problem.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Old Linux systems for non x86 platforms have broken definitions for the
      shared memory size. You need to fix them and rebuild the kernel or
      manually tell <b>wodim</b> to use a smaller FIFO.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If you have buffer underruns or similar problems (like a constantly empty
      drive buffer) and observe a zero <i>fifo empty count</i>, you have
      hardware problems that prevents the data from flowing fast enough from the
      kernel memory to the drive. The FIFO size in this case is sufficient, but
      you should check for a working DMA setup.</dd>

For all examples below, it will be assumed that the CD/DVD-Recorder is connected
  to the primary SCSI bus of the machine. The SCSI target id is set to 2.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To record a pure CD-ROM at double speed, using data from the file
  <i>cdimage.raw</i>:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 wodim -v speed=2 dev=2,0 cdimage.raw
<div class="Pp"></div>
To create an image for a ISO 9660 filesystem with Rock Ridge extensions:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 genisoimage -R -o cdimage.raw /home/joerg/master/tree
<div class="Pp"></div>
To check the resulting file before writing to CD on Solaris:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 mount -r -F fbk -o type=hsfs /dev/fbk0:cdimage.raw /mnt
<div class="Pp"></div>
On Linux:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 mount cdimage.raw -r -t iso9660 -o loop /mnt
<div class="Pp"></div>
Go on with:
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 ls -lR /mnt
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 umount /mnt
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the overall speed of the system is sufficient and the structure of the
  filesystem is not too complex, wodim will run without creating an image of the
  ISO 9660 filesystem. Simply run the pipeline:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 genisoimage -R /master/tree | wodim -v fs=6m speed=2 dev=2,0 -
<div class="Pp"></div>
The recommended minimum FIFO size for running this pipeline is 4 MBytes. As the
  default FIFO size is 4 MB, the <b>fs=</b> option needs only be present if you
  want to use a different FIFO size. If your system is loaded, you should run
  genisoimage in the real time class too. To raise the priority of
  <b>genisoimage</b> replace the command
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 genisoimage -R /master/tree
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
by
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 priocntl -e -c RT -p 59 genisoimage -R /master/tree
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
on Solaris and by
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 nice --18 genisoimage -R /master/tree
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
on systems that don't have <b>UNIX International</b> compliant real-time
  scheduling.
<div class="Pp"></div>
wodim runs at priority 59 on Solaris, you should run genisoimage at no more than
  priority 58. On other systems, you should run genisoimage at no less than nice
  --18.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Creating a CD-ROM without file system image on disk has been tested on a
  Sparcstation-2 with a Yamaha CDR-400. It did work up to quad speed when the
  machine was not loaded. A faster machine may be able to handle quad speed also
  in the loaded case.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To record a pure CD-DA (audio) at single speed, with each track contained in a
  file named <i>track01.cdaudio</i>, <i>track02.cdaudio</i>, etc:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 wodim -v speed=1 dev=/dev/cdrw -audio track*.cdaudio
<div class="Pp"></div>
To check if it will be ok to use double speed for the example above. Use the
  dummy write option:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 wodim -v -dummy speed=2 dev=/dev/cdrw -audio track*.cdaudio
<div class="Pp"></div>
To record a mixed-mode CD with an ISO 9660 filesystem from <i>cdimage.raw</i> on
  the first track, the other tracks being audio tracks from the files
  <i>track01.cdaudio</i>, <i>track02.cdaudio</i>, etc:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 wodim -v dev=2,0 cdimage.raw -audio track*.cdaudio
<div class="Pp"></div>
To handle drives that need to know the size of a track before starting to write,
  first run
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 genisoimage -R -q -print-size /master/tree
<div class="Pp"></div>
and then run
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 genisoimage -R /master/tree | wodim speed=2 dev=2,0 tsize=XXXs -
<div class="Pp"></div>
where <i>XXX</i> is replaced by the output of the previous run of genisoimage.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To copy an audio CD in the most accurate way, first run
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 icedax dev=/dev/cdrom -vall cddb=0 -B -Owav
<div class="Pp"></div>
and then run
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 wodim dev=/dev/cdrw -v -dao -useinfo -text *.wav
<div class="Pp"></div>
This will try to copy track indices and to read CD-Text information from disk.
  If there is no CD-Text information, <b>icedax</b> will try to get the
  information from freedb.org instead.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To copy an audio CD from a pipe (without intermediate files), first run
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 icedax dev=1,0 -vall cddb=0 -info-only
<div class="Pp"></div>
and then run
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 icedax dev=1,0 -no-infofile -B -Oraw - | \
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 wodim dev=2,0 -v -dao -audio -useinfo -text *.inf
<div class="Pp"></div>
This will get all information (including track size info) from the <b>*.inf</b>
  files and then read the audio data from stdin.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If you like to write from <b>stdin</b>, make sure that wodim is called with a
  large enough FIFO size (e.g. <b>fs=128m</b>), reduce the write speed to a
  value below the read speed of the source drive (e.g. <b>speed=12</b>), and get
  a CD/DVD drive with BURN-Free feature if it is not available yet.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To set drive options without writing a CD (e.g. to switch a drive to single
  session mode), run
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 wodim dev=1,0 -setdropts driveropts=singlesession
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you like to do this when no CD is in the drive, call
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 wodim dev=1,0 -force -setdropts driveropts=singlesession
<div class="Pp"></div>
To copy a CD in clone mode, first read the master CD using:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 readom dev=b,t,l -clone f=somefile
<div class="Pp"></div>
or (in case the CD contains many sectors that are unreadable by intention) by
  calling:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 readom dev=1,0 -clone -nocorr f=somefile
<div class="Pp"></div>
will create the files <i>somefile</i> and <i>somefile.toc</i>. Then write the CD
  using:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 wodim dev=1,0 -raw96r -clone -v somefile

On Solaris you need to stop the volume management if you like to use the USCSI
  fallback SCSI transport code. Even things like <b>wodim -scanbus</b> will not
  work if the volume management is running.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Disks made in <b>Track At Once </b> mode are not suitable as a master for direct
  mass production by CD manufacturers. You will need the <b>disk at once</b>
  option to record such disks. Nevertheless the disks made in <b>Track At Once
  </b> will normally be read in all CD players. Some old audio CD players
  however may produce a two second click between two audio tracks.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The minimal size of a track is 4 seconds or 300 sectors. If you write smaller
  tracks, the CD-Recorder will add dummy blocks. This is not an error, even
  though the SCSI-error message looks this way.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The Yamaha CDR-400 and all new SCSI-3/mmc conforming drives are supported in
  single and multi-session.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You should run several tests in all supported speeds of your drive with the
  <b>-dummy</b> option turned on if you are using <b>wodim</b> on an unknown
  system. Writing a CD is a real-time process. <b>NFS, CIFS</b> and other
  network file systems won't always deliver constantly the needed data rates. If
  you want to use <b>wodim</b> with CD-images that are located on a <b>NFS</b>
  mounted filesystem, be sure that the FIFO size is big enough. If you want to
  make sure that buffer underruns are not caused by your source disk, you may
  use the command
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b> wodim -dummy dev=2,0 padsize=600m /dev/null</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
to create a disk that is entirely made of dummy data.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There are also cases where you either need to be root or install <b>wodim</b>
  executable with suid-root permissions. First, if you are using a device
  manufactured before 1999 which requires a non-MMC driver, you should run
  <b>wodim</b> in dummy mode before writing data. If you find a problem doing
  this, please report it to the <b>cdrkit</b> maintainers (see below).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Second, certain functionality may be unusable because of Linux's SCSI command
  filtering. When using <b>wodim</b> for anything except of pure data writing,
  you should also test the process in dummy mode and report trouble to the
  contact address below.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you still want to run <b>wodim</b> with root permissions, you can set the
  permissions of the executable to suid-root. See the additional notes of your
  system/program distribution or README.suidroot which is part of the cdrkit
  source.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You should not connect old drives that do not support disconnect/reconnect to
  either the SCSI bus that is connected to the CD-Recorder or the source disk.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A Compact Disc can have no more than 99 tracks.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When creating a disc with both audio and data tracks, the data should be on
  track 1 otherwise you should create a CDplus disk which is a multi session
  disk with the first session containing the audio tracks and the following
  session containing the data track.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Many operating systems are not able to read more than a single data track, or
  need special software to do so.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you have more information or SCSI command manuals for currently unsupported
  CD/DVD/BR/HD-DVD-Recorders, please contact the <b>cdrkit</b> maintainers (see
  below).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Many CD recorders have bugs and often require a firmware update to work
  correctly. If you experience problems which cannot be solved or explained by
  the notes above, please look for instructions on the homepage of the
  particular manufacturer.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Some bugs will force you to power cycle the device or to reboot the machine.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The FIFO percent output is computed just after a block of data has been written
  to the CD/DVD-Recorder. For this reason, there will never be 100% FIFO fill
  ratio while the FIFO is in streaming mode.

A typical error message for a SCSI command looks like:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">

</pre>
</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The first line gives information about the transport of the command. The text
  after the first colon gives the error text for the system call from the view
  of the kernel. It usually is: <b>I/O error</b> unless other problems happen.
  The next words contain a short description for the SCSI command that fails.
  The rest of the line tells you if there were any problems for the transport of
  the command over the SCSI bus. <b>fatal error</b> means that it was not
  possible to transport the command (i.e. no device present at the requested
  SCSI address).
<div class="Pp"></div>
The second line prints the SCSI command descriptor block for the failed command.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The third line gives information on the SCSI status code returned by the
  command, if the transport of the command succeeds. This is error information
  from the SCSI device.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The fourth line is a hex dump of the auto request sense information for the
  command.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The fifth line is the error text for the sense key if available, followed by the
  segment number that is only valid if the command was a <i>copy</i> command. If
  the error message is not directly related to the current command, the text
  <i>deferred error</i> is appended.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The sixth line is the error text for the sense code and the sense qualifier if
  available. If the type of the device is known, the sense data is decoded from
  tables in <i>scsierrs.c</i> . The text is followed by the error value for a
  field replaceable unit.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The seventh line prints the block number that is related to the failed command
  and text for several error flags. The block number may not be valid.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The eight line reports the timeout set up for this command and the time that the
  command really needed to complete.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The following message is not an error:

  credit for its success. However, he is not involved into the development of
  this spinoff and therefore he shall not be held responsible for any problems
  caused by it. Do not refer to this application as &quot;cdrecord&quot;, do not
  try to get support for wodim by contacting the original authors.
