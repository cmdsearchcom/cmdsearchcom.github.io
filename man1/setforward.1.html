<p>setforward(1) General Commands Manual setforward(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
setforward - create a forwarding database</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
setforward cdb tmp</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
setforward reads a table of forwarding instructions from its
standard input. It converts the table into a forwarding
database. The forwarding database can be used by
fastfor&acirc; <br>
ward.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">setforward writes the forwarding
database to tmp; it then moves tmp to cdb. tmp and cdb must
be on the same filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If there is a problem creating
tmp, setforward complains and leaves cdb alone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The forwarding database format
is portable across machines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INSTRUCTION FORMAT <br>
A forwarding instruction contains a target, a colon, a
series of commands, and a semicolon. Each command is a
recipient address, owner address, external mailing list, or
pro&acirc; <br>
gram. Commands are separated by commas.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">root@yp.to: god@heaven.af.mil,
staff@af.mil;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">says that mail for root@yp.to
should be forwarded to the recipient addresses
god@heaven.af.mil and staff@af.mil.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When setforward sees # it
ignores all text from # to the end of the line:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># this is a comment</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">setforward ignores all other
line endings, so you can split a forwarding instruction
across lines. It also ignores spaces and tabs. Exception:
you can put a space (or tab or <br>
comma or whatever) into a target or command by putting a
backslash in front of it. (However, NUL bytes are not
permitted anywhere.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TARGETS <br>
When fastforward sees the incoming address user@host.dom, it
tries three targets: user@host.dom, @host.dom, and user@. It
obeys the commands for the first target that it finds. <br>
Target names are interpreted without regard to case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All the commands for a single
target must be listed in a single instruction. Exception: an
owner address can be listed in a separate instruction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RECIPIENT ADDRESSES <br>
If a command begins with an ampersand, setforward takes the
remaining bytes in the command as a recipient address:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">boss@yp.to:
&amp;god@heaven.af.mil;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fastforward sends each incoming
mail message to the recipient address. The recipient address
must include a fully qualified domain name. It cannot be
longer than 800 bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a recipient address is itself
a target in the forwarding table, fastforward will
recursively handle the instructions for that target. Note
that @host.dom and user@ wildcards <br>
do not apply here; they apply only to the incoming
address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a command begins with a
letter or number, setforward takes the entire command as a
recipient address:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">boss@yp.to:
god@heaven.af.mil;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OWNER ADDRESSES <br>
If a command begins with a question mark, setforward takes
the remaining bytes in the command as an owner address:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sos@heaven.af.mil:
?owner-sos@heaven.af.mil;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fastforward uses that address as
the envelope sender for forwarded mail, so bounces will go
back to that address. (Normally, if a message is forwarded
to a bad address, it will <br>
bounce back to the original envelope sender.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTERNAL MAILING LISTS <br>
If a command begins with a dot or slash, setforward takes
the entire command as the name of a binary mailing list file
created by setmaillist:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sos@heaven.af.mil:
/etc/lists/sos.bin;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fastforward will read and obey
the commands in that file. The file must be world-readable
and accessible to fastforward.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROGRAMS <br>
If a command begins with a vertical bar or exclamation
point, setforward takes the rest of the command as the name
of a program to run:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dew@: |dew-monitor;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For a vertical bar, fastforward
feeds the message to that program. An exclamation point
works the same way except that fastforward inserts $UFLINE,
$RPLINE, and $DTLINE in front <br>
of the message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DUPLICATES <br>
When fastforward is building the recipient list for a
message, it keeps track of the recipient addresses and
external mailing lists it has used. If the same command
shows up <br>
again, it skips it. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">everybody@yp.to:
programmers@yp.to, testers@yp.to; <br>
programmers@yp.to: joe@yp.to, bob@yp.to; <br>
testers@yp.to: joe@yp.to, fred@yp.to;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A message to everybody@yp.to
will be sent to joe@yp.to only once. (This also means that
addresses in an internal forwarding loop are discarded.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Exception: If a target has an
owner address, commands for that target are considered
different from commands for
&lsquo;&lsquo;outside&rsquo;&rsquo; targets.</p>
