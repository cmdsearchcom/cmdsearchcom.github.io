<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
HylaFAX is a telecommunication system for UNIX&Acirc;&reg;
systems. Among the features of HylaFAX are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; HylaFAX runs as
a network service; this means a modem may be effectively
shared by a large number of users.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; HylaFAX can be
configured to work with a wide variety of modems on a wide
variety of systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Access to the
system can be restricted by the administrator to selected
hosts and/or users.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Transmission
requests may be processed immediately (default) or queued
for processing at a later time, in the manner of the at(1)
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Remote facsimile
machines may be polled to retrieve publicly available
documents.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
POSTSCRIPT&Acirc;&reg;, PDF, and TIFF Class F documents are
passed directly to the fax server for transmission; the
system attempts to convert other file formats to either
POSTSCRIPT or <br>
TIFF through the use of an extensible file typing and
conversion facility. In normal operation ASCII-text,
troff(1) output, and Silicon Graphics images are
automatically con&acirc; <br>
verted. Additional file formats can be added; see
typerules(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The faxcover(1)
program can be automatically invoked to create a cover page
for each facsimile, using information deduced by the sendfax
command. Alternatively, users may <br>
supply their own cover pages using their preferred
tools.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Facsimile are
normally imaged in a system-default page size (usually
letter-size pages, 8.5&quot; by 11&quot;, for sites in North
America). Alternate page sizes can be specified with a <br>
-s option to all HylaFAX programs. Well known page sizes
include: ISO A3, ISO A4, ISO A5, ISO A6, ISO B4, North
American Letter, American Legal, American Ledger, American
<br>
Executive, Japanese Letter, and Japanese Legal. Note that it
may not be permissible to image into the full page area; the
guaranteed reproducible area for a page is typically <br>
smaller. Also, note that while arbitrary page sizes can be
specified, only a limited number of page dimensions are
supported by the facsimile protocol. Thus if an odd-size
<br>
facsimile is submitted for transmission it may not be
possible to determine if it can be sent until the fax server
establishes communication with the remote facsimile
machine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Facsimile can be
sent at low resolution (98 lines/inch) or medium resolution
(196 lines/inch)&acirc;often called fine mode. Documents
with mixed resolution pages are handled cor&acirc; <br>
rectly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Users are
notified by electronic mail if a job can not be transmitted.
It is also possible to receive notification by mail when a
job has been completed successfully and each <br>
time that the job is requeued for retransmission. Any
untransmitted documents are returned to the sender by
electronic mail in a form suitable for resubmission.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Support is
provided for broadcasting facsimile. The HylaFAX server
software optimizes preparation of broadcast documents and
the client applications support the notion of a <br>
job group which permits a group of jobs to be manipulated
together.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Support is
provided for transmitting alpha-numeric messages to pager
devices or GSM mobiles using the Simple Network Paging
Protocol (SNPP) and the IXO or UCP protocol (for <br>
message delivery).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The HylaFAX software is divided
into two packages: software used on client machines and
software used on machines where one or more modems reside.
Client software includes:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; sendfax, a
program to submit outgoing facsimile;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; sendpage, a
program to submit alpha-numeric messages to SNPP
servers;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; faxstat, a
program obtain status information about HylaFAX servers;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; faxrm, a program
to remove jobs and documents;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; faxalter, a
program to change parameters of queued jobs; and</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; fax2ps, a
program that converts facsimile documents to POSTSCRIPT so
that they may be viewed with a POSTSCRIPT previewer or
printed on a POSTSCRIPT printer (this program is <br>
actually part of the companion TIFF distribution that is
used by HylaFAX).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Many systems also support
submission of outgoing facsimile by electronic mail and/or
graphical interfaces to the sendfax program. Such facilities
are site-dependent; consult <br>
local documentation for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GETTING STARTED <br>
To use the HylaFAX client software on your machine you need
to either load the appropriate software on your machine, or
you need to locate a machine that already has the client
<br>
software installed and setup symbolic links to the
appropriate directories. If you choose the latter, then
beware that you need links to three directories: the
directory where <br>
client applications reside, /usr/bin, the directory where
the client application database files reside, /etc/hylafax,
and the directory where document conversion programs reside,
<br>
/usr/sbin (the last two directories may be the same on your
system).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once the software is setup on
your machine you need to locate a host that has a facsimile
server that you can use. The host, and possibly the modem on
the host, should be <br>
defined in your environment in the FAXSERVER variable. For
example, for csh users,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">setenv FAXSERVER flake.asd</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or for ksh or sh users,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FAXSERVER=flake.asd; export
FAXSERVER</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If there are multiple modems on
your server then you may be assigned to use a specific
modem. For example, if you are to use the modem attached to
the ttym2 port on the server <br>
machine, then the FAXSERVER variable should be setup as</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FAXSERVER=ttym2@flake.asd;
export FAXSERVER</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(Note: the SNPPSERVER
environment variable is used instead of FAXSERVER by the
sendpage program; consult sendpage(8) for more
information.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note also, that before you can
submit outgoing facsimile jobs the administrator for the
facsimile server may need to register your identity in an
access control list. You will <br>
encounter the message &lsquo;&lsquo;530 User %s access
denied.&rsquo;&rsquo; if access to your server is controlled
and you are not properly registered or you may be prompted
for a password and then <br>
denied service with &lsquo;&lsquo;530 Login
incorrect.&rsquo;&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAL STRINGS <br>
A dial string specifies how to dial the telephone in order
to reach a destination facsimile machine. HylaFAX permits
arbitrary strings to be passed to the facsimile server so
<br>
that users can specify credit card information, PBX routing
information, etc. Alphabetic characters are automatically
mapped to their numeric key equivalents (e.g.
&lsquo;&lsquo;1800Got&acirc; <br>
Milk&rsquo;&rsquo; becomes
&lsquo;&lsquo;18004686455&rsquo;&rsquo;). Other characters
can be included for readability; anything that must be
stripped will be removed by the server before the dialing
string is <br>
passed to the fax modem. Private information such as credit
card access codes are withheld from status messages and
publicly accessible log files (with proper configuration).
<br>
Facsimile servers also automatically insert any leading
dialing prefixing strings that are required to place
outgoing phone calls; e.g. dialing
&lsquo;&lsquo;9&rsquo;&rsquo; to get an outside line. <br>
Additionally, if a phone number is fully specified with the
international direct dialing digits (IDDD), then any
prefixing long distance or international dialing codes that
are <br>
required to place the call will be inserted in the dial
string by the server. For example,
&lsquo;&lsquo;+31.77.594.131&rsquo;&rsquo; is a phone number
in the Netherlands; it would be converted to <br>
&lsquo;&lsquo;0113177594131&rsquo;&rsquo; if the call is
placed in the United States. The number
&lsquo;&lsquo;+14159657824&rsquo;&rsquo; is a phone number
in California; if this number is called from within the 415
area code <br>
in the United States, then the server would automatically
convert this to &lsquo;&lsquo;9657824&rsquo;&rsquo; because
in the San Francisco Bay Area, local phone calls must not
include the area code and <br>
long distance prefixing code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The general rule in crafting
dial strings is to specify exactly what you would dial on
your telephone; and, in addition, the actual phone number
can be specified in a location- <br>
independent manner by using the IDD syntax of
&lsquo;&lsquo;+country-code local-part&rsquo;&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COVER PAGES <br>
The sendfax program can automatically generate a cover page
for each outgoing facsimile. Such cover pages are actually
created by the faxcover(1) program by using information <br>
that is deduced by sendfax and information that is supplied
on the command line invocation of sendfax. Users may also
request that sendfax not supply a cover page and then
pro&acirc; <br>
vide their own cover page as part of the data that is to be
transmitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Automatically-generated cover
pages may include the following information:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; the
sender&rsquo;s name, affiliation, geographic location, fax
number, and voice telephone number;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; the
recipient&rsquo;s name, affiliation, geographic location,
fax number, and voice telephone number;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; text explaining
what this fax is &lsquo;&lsquo;regarding&rsquo;&rsquo;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; text
commentary;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; the local date
and time that the job was submitted;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; the number of
pages to be transmitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Certain of this information is
currently obtained from a user&rsquo;s personal facsimile
database file; ~/.faxdb. Note that this file is deprecated;
it is described here only because <br>
it is still supported for compatibility with older versions
of the software.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The .faxdb file is an ASCII file
with entries of the form</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">keyword : value</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where keyword includes:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Name a name associated with
destination fax machine;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Company a company name;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Location in-company locational
information, e.g. a building#;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FAX-Number phone number of fax
machine;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Voice-Number voice telephone
number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Data is free format. Whitespace
(blank, tab, newline) can be freely interspersed with
tokens. If tokens include whitespace, they must be enclosed
in quote marks (&lsquo;&lsquo;&quot;&rsquo;&rsquo;). The
<br>
&lsquo;&lsquo;#&rsquo;&rsquo; character introduces a
comment&acirc;everything to the end of the line is
discarded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Entries are collected into
aggregate records by enclosing them in
&lsquo;&lsquo;[]&rsquo;&rsquo;. Records can be nested to
create a hierarchy that that supports the inheritance of
information&acirc;unspeci&acirc; <br>
fied information is inherited from parent aggregate
records.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, a sample file might
be: <br>
[ Company: &quot;Silicon Graphics, Inc.&quot; <br>
Location: &quot;Mountain View, California&quot; <br>
[ Name: &quot;Sam Leffler&quot; FAX-Number: +1.415.965.7824
] <br>
]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">which could be extended to
include another person at Silicon Graphics with the
following: <br>
[ Company: &quot;Silicon Graphics, Inc.&quot; <br>
Location: &quot;Mountain View, California&quot; <br>
[ Name: &quot;Sam Leffler&quot; FAX-Number: +1.415.965.7824
] <br>
[ Name: &quot;Paul Haeberli&quot; FAX-Number:
+1.415.965.7824 ] <br>
]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Experience indicates that the
hierarchical nature of this database format makes it
difficult to maintain with automated mechanisms. As a result
it is being replaced by other, <br>
more straightforward databases that are managed by programs
that front-end the sendfax program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION FILES <br>
HylaFAX client applications can be tailored on a per-user
and per-site basis through configuration files. Per-site
controls are placed in the file /etc/hylafax/hyla.conf,
while <br>
per-user controls go in ~/.hylarc. In addition a few
programs that have many parameters that are specific to
their operation support an additional configuration file;
these <br>
files are identified in their manual pages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Configuration files have a
simple format and are entirely ASCII. A configuration
parameter is of the form <br>
tag: value <br>
where a tag identifies a parameter and a value is either a
string, number, or boolean value. Comments are introduced by
the &lsquo;&lsquo;#&rsquo;&rsquo; character and extend to
the end of the line. <br>
String values start at the first non-blank character after
the &lsquo;&lsquo;:&rsquo;&rsquo; and continue to the first
non-whitespace character or, if whitespace is to be
included, may be enclosed in <br>
quote marks (&lsquo;&lsquo;&quot;&rsquo;&rsquo;). String
values enclosed in quote marks may also use the standard C
programming conventions for specifying escape codes; e.g.
&lsquo;&lsquo;0&rsquo; for a newline character <br>
and &lsquo;&lsquo;&rsquo;&rsquo; for an octal value. Numeric
values are specified according to the C programming
conventions (leading &lsquo;&lsquo;0x&rsquo;&rsquo; for hex,
leading &lsquo;&lsquo;0&rsquo;&rsquo; for octal, otherwise
decimal). <br>
Boolean values are case insensitive. For a true value,
either &lsquo;&lsquo;Yes&rsquo;&rsquo; or
&lsquo;&lsquo;On&rsquo;&rsquo; should be used. For a false
value, use &lsquo;&lsquo;No&rsquo;&rsquo; or
&lsquo;&lsquo;Off&rsquo;&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RECEIVED FACSIMILE <br>
Incoming facsimile are received by facsimile servers and
deposited in a receive queue directory on the server
machine. Depending on the server&rsquo;s configuration,
files in this <br>
directory may or may not be readable by normal users. The
faxstat program can be used to view the contents of the
receive queue directory: <br>
hyla% faxstat -r <br>
HylaFAX scheduler on hyla.chez.sgi.com: Running <br>
Modem ttyf2 (+1 510 999-0123): Running and idle</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Protect Page Owner Sender/TSI

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Consult the faxstat manual page
for a more detailed description of this information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Received facsimile are stored as
TIFF Class F files. These files are bilevel images that are
encoded using the CCITT T.4 or CCITT T.6 encoding
algorithms. The fax2ps(1) program <br>
can be used to view and print these files. A file can be
viewed by converting it to POSTSCRIPT and then viewing it
with a suitable POSTSCRIPT previewing program, such as <br>
xpsview(1) (Adobe&rsquo;s Display POSTSCRIPT-based viewer),
ghostview(1) (a public domain previewer), or image viewer
programs such as viewfax(1) (public domain), faxview(1)
(another <br>
public domain TIFF viewer program), xv(1) (shareware and/or
public domain), or xtiff(1) (a program included in the
public domain TIFF software distribution). Consult your
local <br>
resources to figure out what tools are available for viewing
and printing received facsimile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CLIENT-SERVER PROTOCOL <br>
HylaFAX client applications communicate with servers using
either a special-purpose communications protocol that is
modeled after the Internet File Transfer Protocol (FTP) or,
<br>
when submitting alpha-numeric pages, the Simple Network
Paging Protocol (SNPP), specified in RFC 1861. All client
programs support a -v option that can be used to observe the
<br>
protocol message exchanges. In some situations it may be
more effective to communicate directly with a HylaFAX server
using the client-server protocol. This can be accomplished
<br>
with an FTP or Telnet client application; though an FTP
client is recommended because it implements the protocol
needed to obtain server status information. For information
on <br>
the server-side support provided with HylaFAX consult
hfaxd(8). For documentation on the client-server fax
protocol consult RFC XXXX (to be filled in).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
This section gives several examples of command line usage;
consult the manual pages for the individual commands for
information on the options and program operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following command queues the
file zall.ps for transmission to John Doe at the number
(123)456-7890 using fine mode; the server will attempt to
send it at 4:30 A.M.: <br>
sendfax -a &quot;0430&quot; -m -d &quot;John
Doe@1.123.456.7890&quot; zall.ps <br>
(the leading &lsquo;&lsquo;1.&rsquo;&rsquo; is supplied to
dial area code &lsquo;&lsquo;123&rsquo;&rsquo; in the United
States.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following command generates
a one-page facsimile that is just a cover page: <br>
