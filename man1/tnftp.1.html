<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
ftp is the user interface to the Internet standard File
Transfer Protocol. The program allows a user to transfer
files to and from a remote network site.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The last five arguments will
fetch a file using the FTP or HTTP protocols, or by direct
copying, into the current directory. This is ideal for
scripts. Refer to AUTO-FETCHING <br>
FILES below for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options may be specified at the
command line, or to the command interpreter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-4 Forces ftp to only use IPv4
addresses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-6 Forces ftp to only use IPv6
addresses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A Force active mode ftp. By
default, ftp will try to use passive mode ftp and fall back
to active mode if passive is not supported by the server.
This option causes ftp <br>
to always use an active connection. It is only useful for
connecting to very old servers that do not implement passive
mode properly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a Causes ftp to bypass normal
login procedure, and use an anonymous login instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Enables debugging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e Disables command line
editing. This is useful for Emacs ange-ftp mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Forces a cache reload for
transfers that go through the FTP or HTTP proxies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g Disables file name
globbing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i Turns off interactive
prompting during multiple file transfers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N netrc Use netrc instead of
~/.netrc. Refer to THE .netrc FILE for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Restrains ftp from attempting
&acirc;auto-login&acirc; upon initial connection for non
auto-fetch transfers. If auto-login is enabled, ftp will
check the .netrc (see below) file <br>
in the user&rsquo;s home directory for an entry describing
an account on the remote machine. If no entry exists, ftp
will prompt for the remote machine login name (default <br>
is the user identity on the local machine), and, if
necessary, prompt for a password and an account with which
to login. To override the auto-login for auto-fetch <br>
transfers, specify the username (and optionally, password)
as appropriate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o output When auto-fetching
files, save the contents in output. output is parsed
according to the FILE NAMING CONVENTIONS below. If output is
not &acirc;-&acirc; or doesn&rsquo;t start with <br>
&acirc;|&acirc;, then only the first file specified will be
retrieved into output; all other files will be retrieved
into the basename of their remote name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P port Sets the port number to
port.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p Enable passive mode operation
for use behind connection filtering firewalls. This option
has been deprecated as ftp now tries to use passive mode by
default, falling <br>
back to active mode if the server does not support passive
connections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q quittime <br>
Quit if the connection has stalled for quittime seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R Restart all non-proxied
auto-fetches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r wait Retry the connection
attempt if it failed, pausing for wait seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s srcaddr Uses srcaddr as the
local IP address for all connections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Enables packet tracing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T direction,maximum[,increment]
<br>
Set the maximum transfer rate for direction to maximum
bytes/second, and if specified, the increment to increment
bytes/second. Refer to rate for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u URL file [...] <br>
Upload files on the command line to URL where URL is one of
the ftp URL types as supported by auto-fetch (with an
optional target filename for single file uploads), and <br>
file is one or more local files to be uploaded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Disable verbose and progress,
overriding the default of enabled when output is to a
terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Enable verbose and progress.
This is the default if output is to a terminal (and in the
case of progress, ftp is the foreground process). Forces ftp
to show all <br>
responses from the remote server, as well as report on data
transfer statistics.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x xferbufsize <br>
Set the size of the socket send and receive buffers to
xferbufsize. Refer to xferbuf for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The client host with which ftp
is to communicate may be specified on the command line. If
this is done, ftp will immediately attempt to establish a
connection to an FTP server on <br>
that host; otherwise, ftp will enter its command interpreter
and await instructions from the user. When ftp is awaiting
commands from the user the prompt &acirc;ftp&gt;&acirc; is
provided to the <br>
user. The following commands are recognized by ftp:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">! [command [args]] <br>
Invoke an interactive shell on the local machine. If there
are arguments, the first is taken to be a command to execute
directly, with the rest of the arguments as its <br>
arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ macro-name [args] <br>
Execute the macro macro-name that was defined with the
macdef command. Arguments are passed to the macro
unglobbed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">account [passwd] <br>
Supply a supplemental password required by a remote system
for access to resources once a login has been successfully
completed. If no argument is included, the user <br>
will be prompted for an account password in a non-echoing
input mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">append local-file [remote-file]
<br>
Append a local file to a file on the remote machine. If
remote-file is left unspecified, the local file name is used
in naming the remote file after being altered by <br>
any ntrans or nmap setting. File transfer uses the current
settings for type, format, mode, and structure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ascii Set the file transfer type
to network ASCII. This is the default type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bell Arrange that a bell be
sounded after each file transfer command is completed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">binary Set the file transfer
type to support binary image transfer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bye Terminate the FTP session
with the remote server and exit ftp. An end of file will
also terminate the session and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">case Toggle remote computer file
name case mapping during get, mget and mput commands. When
case is on (default is off), remote computer file names with
all letters in <br>
upper case are written in the local directory with the
letters mapped to lower case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cd remote-directory <br>
Change the working directory on the remote machine to
remote-directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cdup Change the remote machine
working directory to the parent of the current remote
machine working directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">chmod mode remote-file <br>
Change the permission modes of the file remote-file on the
remote system to mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">close Terminate the FTP session
with the remote server, and return to the command
interpreter. Any defined macros are erased.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cr Toggle carriage return
stripping during ascii type file retrieval. Records are
denoted by a carriage return/linefeed sequence during ascii
type file transfer. When cr <br>
is on (the default), carriage returns are stripped from this
sequence to conform with the UNIX single linefeed record
delimiter. Records on non-UNIX remote systems may <br>
contain single linefeeds; when an ascii type transfer is
made, these linefeeds may be distinguished from a record
delimiter only when cr is off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">delete remote-file <br>
Delete the file remote-file on the remote machine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dir [remote-path [local-file]]
<br>
Print a listing of the contents of a directory on the remote
machine. The listing includes any system-dependent
information that the server chooses to include; for <br>
example, most UNIX systems will produce output from the
command &acirc;ls -l&acirc;. If remote-path is left
unspecified, the current working directory is used. If
interactive <br>
prompting is on, ftp will prompt the user to verify that the
last argument is indeed the target local file for receiving
dir output. If no local file is specified, or <br>
if local-file is &acirc;-&acirc;, the output is sent to the
terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">disconnect A synonym for
close.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">edit Toggle command line
editing, and context sensitive command and file completion.
This is automatically enabled if input is from a terminal,
and disabled otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">epsv epsv4 epsv6 <br>
Toggle the use of the extended EPSV and EPRT commands on all
IP, IPv4, and IPv6 connections respectively. First try EPSV
/ EPRT, and then PASV / PORT. This is enabled <br>
by default. If an extended command fails then this option
will be temporarily disabled for the duration of the current
connection, or until epsv, epsv4, or epsv6 is <br>
executed again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">exit A synonym for bye.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">features Display what features
the remote server supports (using the FEAT command).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fget localfile <br>
Retrieve the files listed in localfile, which has one line
per filename.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">form format <br>
Set the file transfer form to format. The default (and only
supported) format is &acirc;non-print&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ftp host [port] <br>
A synonym for open.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ftp_debug [ftp_debug-value] <br>
Toggle debugging mode. If an optional ftp_debug-value is
specified it is used to set the debugging level. When
debugging is on, ftp prints each command sent to the <br>
remote machine, preceded by the string
&acirc;--&gt;&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gate [host [port]] <br>
Toggle gate-ftp mode, which used to connect through the TIS
FWTK and Gauntlet ftp proxies. This will not be permitted if
the gate-ftp server hasn&rsquo;t been set (either <br>
explicitly by the user, or from the FTPSERVER environment
variable). If host is given, then gate-ftp mode will be
enabled, and the gate-ftp server will be set to host. <br>
If port is also given, that will be used as the port to
connect to on the gate-ftp server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">get remote-file [local-file]
<br>
Retrieve the remote-file and store it on the local machine.
If the local file name is not specified, it is given the
same name it has on the remote machine, subject to <br>
alteration by the current case, ntrans, and nmap settings.
The current settings for type, form, mode, and structure are
used while transferring the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">glob Toggle filename expansion
for mdelete, mget, mput, and mreget. If globbing is turned
off with glob, the file name arguments are taken literally
and not expanded. <br>
Globbing for mput is done as in csh(1). For mdelete, mget,
and mreget, each remote file name is expanded separately on
the remote machine and the lists are not merged. <br>
Expansion of a directory name is likely to be different from
expansion of the name of an ordinary file: the exact result
depends on the foreign operating system and ftp <br>
server, and can be previewed by doing &acirc;mls
remote-files -&acirc; Note: mget, mput and mreget are not
meant to transfer entire directory subtrees of files. That
can be done <br>
by transferring a tar(1) archive of the subtree (in binary
mode).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hash [size] <br>
Toggle hash-sign (&acirc;#&acirc;) printing for each data
block transferred. The size of a data block defaults to 1024
bytes. This can be changed by specifying size in bytes. <br>
Enabling hash disables progress.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">help [command] <br>
Print an informative message about the meaning of command.
If no argument is given, ftp prints a list of the known
commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">idle [seconds] <br>
Set the inactivity timer on the remote server to seconds
seconds. If seconds is omitted, the current inactivity timer
is printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">image A synonym for binary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lcd [directory] <br>
Change the working directory on the local machine. If no
directory is specified, the user&rsquo;s home directory is
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">less file A synonym for
page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lpage local-file <br>
Display local-file with the program specified by the set
pager option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lpwd Print the working directory
on the local machine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ls [remote-path [local-file]]
<br>
A synonym for dir.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">macdef macro-name <br>
Define a macro. Subsequent lines are stored as the macro
macro-name; a null line (consecutive newline characters in a
file or carriage returns from the terminal) ter&acirc; <br>
minates macro input mode. There is a limit of 16 macros and
4096 total characters in all defined macros. Macro names can
be a maximum of 8 characters. Macros are <br>
only applicable to the current session they are defined
within (or if defined outside a session, to the session
invoked with the next open command), and remain defined <br>
until a close command is executed. To invoke a macro, use
the $ command (see above).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The macro processor interprets
&acirc;$&acirc; and &acirc;&acirc; as special characters. A
&acirc;$&acirc; followed by a number (or numbers) is
replaced by the corresponding argument on the macro
invo&acirc; <br>
cation command line. A &acirc;$&acirc; followed by an
&acirc;i&acirc; signals the macro processor that the
executing macro is to be looped. On the first pass
&acirc;$i&acirc; is replaced by the first <br>
argument on the macro invocation command line, on the second
pass it is replaced by the second argument, and so on. A
&acirc;&acirc; followed by any character is replaced by that
<br>
character. Use the &acirc;&acirc; to prevent special
treatment of the &acirc;$&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mdelete [remote-files] <br>
Delete the remote-files on the remote machine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mdir remote-files local-file
<br>
Like dir, except multiple remote files may be specified. If
interactive prompting is on, ftp will prompt the user to
verify that the last argument is indeed the target <br>
local file for receiving mdir output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mget remote-files <br>
Expand the remote-files on the remote machine and do a get
for each file name thus produced. See glob for details on
the filename expansion. Resulting file names will <br>
then be processed according to case, ntrans, and nmap
settings. Files are transferred into the local working
directory, which can be changed with &acirc;lcd
directory&acirc;; new <br>
local directories can be created with &acirc;! mkdir
directory&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mkdir directory-name <br>
Make a directory on the remote machine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mls remote-files local-file <br>
Like ls, except multiple remote files may be specified, and
the local-file must be specified. If interactive prompting
is on, ftp will prompt the user to verify that <br>
the last argument is indeed the target local file for
receiving mls output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mlsd [remote-path] <br>
Display the contents of remote-path (which should default to
the current directory if not given) in a machine-parsable
form, using MLSD. The format of display can be <br>
changed with &acirc;remopts mlst ...&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mlst [remote-path] <br>
Display the details about remote-path (which should default
to the current directory if not given) in a machine-parsable
form, using MLST. The format of display can be <br>
changed with &acirc;remopts mlst ...&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mode mode-name <br>
Set the file transfer mode to mode-name. The default (and
only supported) mode is &acirc;stream&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">modtime remote-file <br>
Show the last modification time of the file on the remote
machine, in RFC 2822 format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">more file A synonym for
page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mput local-files <br>
Expand wild cards in the list of local files given as
arguments and do a put for each file in the resulting list.
See glob for details of filename expansion. Result&acirc;
<br>
ing file names will then be processed according to ntrans
and nmap settings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mreget remote-files <br>
As per mget, but performs a reget instead of get.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">msend local-files <br>
A synonym for mput.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">newer remote-file [local-file]
<br>
Get the file only if the modification time of the remote
file is more recent that the file on the current system. If
the file does not exist on the current system, the <br>
remote file is considered newer. Otherwise, this command is
identical to get.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nlist [remote-path [local-file]]
<br>
A synonym for ls.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nmap [inpattern outpattern] <br>
Set or unset the filename mapping mechanism. If no arguments
are specified, the filename mapping mechanism is unset. If
arguments are specified, remote filenames are <br>
mapped during mput commands and put commands issued without
a specified remote target filename. If arguments are
specified, local filenames are mapped during mget com&acirc;
<br>
mands and get commands issued without a specified local
target filename. This command is useful when connecting to a
non-UNIX remote computer with different file nam&acirc; <br>
ing conventions or practices. The mapping follows the
pattern set by inpattern and outpattern. [Inpattern] is a
template for incoming filenames (which may have <br>
already been processed according to the ntrans and case
settings). Variable templating is accomplished by including
the sequences &acirc;$1&acirc;, &acirc;$2&acirc;, ...
&acirc;$9&acirc; in inpattern. <br>
Use &acirc;&acirc; to prevent this special treatment of the
&acirc;$&acirc; character. All other characters are treated
literally, and are used to determine the nmap [inpattern]
variable <br>
values. For example, given inpattern $1.$2 and the remote
file name &quot;mydata.data&quot;, $1 would have the value
&quot;mydata&quot;, and $2 would have the value
&quot;data&quot;. The <br>
outpattern determines the resulting mapped filename. The
sequences &acirc;$1&acirc;, &acirc;$2&acirc;, ...
&acirc;$9&acirc; are replaced by any value resulting from
the inpattern template. The sequence <br>
&acirc;$0&acirc; is replaced by the original filename.
Additionally, the sequence &acirc;[seq1, seq2]&acirc; is
replaced by [seq1] if seq1 is not a null string; otherwise
it is replaced by <br>
seq2. For example, the command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nmap $1.$2.$3
[$1,$2].[$2,file]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">would yield the output filename
&quot;myfile.data&quot; for input filenames
&quot;myfile.data&quot; and &quot;myfile.data.old&quot;,
&quot;myfile.file&quot; for the input filename
&quot;myfile&quot;, and <br>
&quot;myfile.myfile&quot; for the input filename
&quot;.myfile&quot;. Spaces may be included in outpattern,
as in the example: <br>
nmap $1 sed s/ *$// &gt; $1 <br>
Use the &acirc;&acirc; character to prevent special
treatment of the &acirc;$&acirc;, &acirc;[&acirc;,
&acirc;]&acirc;, and &acirc;,&acirc; characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ntrans [inchars [outchars]] <br>
Set or unset the filename character translation mechanism.
If no arguments are specified, the filename character
translation mechanism is unset. If arguments are <br>
specified, characters in remote filenames are translated
during mput commands and put commands issued without a
specified remote target filename. If arguments are <br>
specified, characters in local filenames are translated
during mget commands and get commands issued without a
specified local target filename. This command is useful <br>
when connecting to a non-UNIX remote computer with different
file naming conventions or practices. Characters in a
filename matching a character in inchars are <br>
replaced with the corresponding character in outchars. If
the character&rsquo;s position in inchars is longer than the
length of outchars, the character is deleted from the <br>
file name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">open host [port] <br>
Establish a connection to the specified host FTP server. An
optional port number may be supplied, in which case, ftp
will attempt to contact an FTP server at that <br>
port. If the set auto-login option is on (default), ftp will
also attempt to automatically log the user in to the FTP
server (see below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">page file Retrieve file and
display with the program specified by the set pager
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">passive [auto] <br>
Toggle passive mode (if no arguments are given). If auto is
given, act as if FTPMODE is set to &acirc;auto&acirc;. If
passive mode is turned on (default), ftp will send a PASV
<br>
command for all data connections instead of a PORT command.
The PASV command requests that the remote server open a port
for the data connection and return the address <br>
of that port. The remote server listens on that port and the
client connects to it. When using the more traditional PORT
command, the client listens on a port and <br>
sends that address to the remote server, who connects back
to it. Passive mode is useful when using ftp through a
gateway router or host that controls the directional&acirc;
<br>
ity of traffic. (Note that though FTP servers are required
to support the PASV command by RFC 1123, some do not.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pdir [remote-path] <br>
Perform dir [remote-path], and display the result with the
program specified by the set pager option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pls [remote-path] <br>
Perform ls [remote-path], and display the result with the
program specified by the set pager option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pmlsd [remote-path] <br>
Perform mlsd [remote-path], and display the result with the
program specified by the set pager option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">preserve Toggle preservation of
modification times on retrieved files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">progress Toggle display of
transfer progress bar. The progress bar will be disabled for
a transfer that has local-file as &acirc;-&acirc; or a
command that starts with &acirc;|&acirc;. Refer to FILE <br>
NAMING CONVENTIONS for more information. Enabling progress
disables hash.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">prompt Toggle interactive
prompting. Interactive prompting occurs during multiple file
transfers to allow the user to selectively retrieve or store
files. If prompting is <br>
turned off (default is on), any mget or mput will transfer
all files, and any mdelete will delete all files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When prompting is on, the
following commands are available at a prompt:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a Answer &acirc;yes&acirc; to
the current file, and automatically answer &acirc;yes&acirc;
to any remaining files for the current command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">n Answer &acirc;no&acirc;, and
do not transfer the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">p Answer &acirc;yes&acirc; to
the current file, and turn off prompt mode (as is
&acirc;prompt off&acirc; had been given).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">q Terminate the current
operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">y Answer &acirc;yes&acirc;, and
transfer the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">? Display a help message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any other response will answer
&acirc;yes&acirc; to the current file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">proxy ftp-command <br>
Execute an ftp command on a secondary control connection.
This command allows simultaneous connection to two remote
FTP servers for transferring files between the two <br>
servers. The first proxy command should be an open, to
establish the secondary control connection. Enter the
command &quot;proxy ?&quot; to see other FTP commands
executable on <br>
the secondary connection. The following commands behave
differently when prefaced by proxy: open will not define new
macros during the auto-login process, close will <br>
not erase existing macro definitions, get and mget transfer
files from the host on the primary control connection to the
host on the secondary control connection, and <br>
put, mput, and append transfer files from the host on the
secondary control connection to the host on the primary
control connection. Third party file transfers depend <br>
upon support of the FTP protocol PASV command by the server
on the secondary control connection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">put local-file [remote-file]
<br>
Store a local file on the remote machine. If remote-file is
left unspecified, the local file name is used after
processing according to any ntrans or nmap settings in <br>
naming the remote file. File transfer uses the current
settings for type, format, mode, and structure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rate direction [maximum
[increment]] <br>
Throttle the maximum transfer rate to maximum bytes/second.
If maximum is 0, disable the throttle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">direction may be one of: <br>
all Both directions. <br>
get Incoming transfers. <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rcvbuf size <br>
Set the size of the socket receive buffer to size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">recv remote-file [local-file]
<br>
A synonym for get.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reget remote-file [local-file]
<br>
reget acts like get, except that if local-file exists and is
smaller than remote-file, local-file is presumed to be a
partially transferred copy of remote-file and the <br>
transfer is continued from the apparent point of failure.
This command is useful when transferring very large files
over networks that are prone to dropping connec&acirc; <br>
tions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">remopts command
[command-options] <br>
Set options on the remote FTP server for command to
command-options (whose absence is handled on a
command-specific basis). Remote FTP commands known to
support <br>
options include: &acirc;MLST&acirc; (used for MLSD and
MLST).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rename [from [to]] <br>
Rename the file from on the remote machine, to the file
to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reset Clear reply queue. This
command re-synchronizes command/reply sequencing with the
remote FTP server. Resynchronization may be necessary
following a violation of the <br>
FTP protocol by the remote server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">restart marker <br>
Restart the immediately following get or put at the
indicated marker. On UNIX systems, marker is usually a byte
offset into the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rhelp [command-name] <br>
Request help from the remote FTP server. If a command-name
is specified it is supplied to the server as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rmdir directory-name <br>
Delete a directory on the remote machine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rstatus [remote-file] <br>
With no arguments, show status of remote machine. If
remote-file is specified, show status of remote-file on
remote machine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">runique Toggle storing of files
on the local system with unique filenames. If a file already
exists with a name equal to the target local filename for a
get or mget command, a <br>
&quot;.1&quot; is appended to the name. If the resulting
name matches another existing file, a &quot;.2&quot; is
appended to the original name. If this process continues up
to &quot;.99&quot;, an <br>
error message is printed, and the transfer does not take
place. The generated unique filename will be reported. Note
that runique will not affect local files gener&acirc; <br>
ated from a shell command (see below). The default value is
off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">send local-file [remote-file]
<br>
A synonym for put.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sendport Toggle the use of PORT
commands. By default, ftp will attempt to use a PORT command
when establishing a connection for each data transfer. The
use of PORT commands <br>
can prevent delays when performing multiple file transfers.
If the PORT command fails, ftp will use the default data
port. When the use of PORT commands is disabled, <br>
no attempt will be made to use PORT commands for each data
transfer. This is useful for certain FTP implementations
which do ignore PORT commands but, incorrectly, <br>
indicate they&rsquo;ve been accepted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set [option value] <br>

network ASCII.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">umask [newmask] <br>
Set the default umask on the remote server to newmask. If

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unset option <br>
Unset option. Refer to set for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">usage command <br>
Print the usage message for command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">user user-name [password
[account]] <br>
Identify yourself to the remote FTP server. If the password
is not specified and the server requires it, ftp will prompt
the user for it (after disabling local echo). <br>
If an account field is not specified, and the FTP server
requires it, the user will be prompted for it. If an account
field is specified, an account command will be <br>
relayed to the remote server after the login sequence is
completed if the remote server did not require it for
logging in. Unless ftp is invoked with
&acirc;auto-login&acirc; dis&acirc; <br>
abled, this process is done automatically on initial
connection to the FTP server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">verbose Toggle verbose mode. In
verbose mode, all responses from the FTP server are
displayed to the user. In addition, if verbose is on, when a
file transfer completes, sta&acirc; <br>
tistics regarding the efficiency of the transfer are
reported. By default, verbose is on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xferbuf size <br>
Set the size of the socket send and receive buffers to
size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">? [command] <br>
A synonym for help.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Command arguments which have
embedded spaces may be quoted with quote
&acirc;&quot;&acirc; marks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Commands which toggle settings
can take an explicit on or off argument to force the setting
appropriately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Commands which take a byte count
as an argument (e.g., hash, rate, and xferbuf) support an
optional suffix on the argument which changes the
interpretation of the argument. Sup&acirc; <br>

b Causes no modification. (Optional) <br>
k Kilo; multiply the argument by 1024 <br>
m Mega; multiply the argument by 1048576 <br>
g Giga; multiply the argument by 1073741824</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If ftp receives a SIGINFO (see
the &acirc;status&acirc; argument of stty(1)) or SIGQUIT
signal whilst a transfer is in progress, the current
transfer rate statistics will be written to the <br>
standard error output, in the same format as the standard
completion message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTO-FETCHING FILES <br>
In addition to standard commands, this version of ftp
supports an auto-fetch feature. To enable auto-fetch, simply
pass the list of hostnames/files on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following formats are valid
syntax for an auto-fetch element:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[user@]host:[path][/] <br>
&acirc;Classic&acirc; FTP format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If path contains a glob
character and globbing is enabled, (see glob), then the
equivalent of &acirc;mget path&acirc; is performed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the directory component of
path contains no globbing characters, it is stored locally
with the name basename (see basename(1)) of path, in the
current directory. Other&acirc; <br>
wise, the full remote name is used as the local name,
relative to the local root directory.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">ftp://[user[:password]@]host[:port]/path[/][;type=X]
<br>
An FTP URL, retrieved using the FTP protocol if set
ftp_proxy isn&rsquo;t defined. Otherwise, transfer the URL
using HTTP via the proxy defined in set ftp_proxy. If set
ftp_proxy <br>
isn&rsquo;t defined and user is given, login as user. In
this case, use password if supplied, otherwise prompt the
user for one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a suffix of
&acirc;;type=A&acirc; or &acirc;;type=I&acirc; is supplied,
then the transfer type will take place as ascii or binary
(respectively). The default transfer type is binary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to be compliant with
RFC 3986, ftp interprets the path part of an
&acirc;ftp://&acirc; auto-fetch URL as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The
&acirc;/&acirc; immediately after the host[:port] is
interpreted as a separator before the path, and not as part
of the path itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The path is
interpreted as a &acirc;/&acirc;-separated list of name
components. For all but the last such component, ftp
performs the equivalent of a cd command. For the last path
<br>
component, ftp performs the equivalent of a get command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Empty name
components, which result from &acirc;//&acirc; within the
path, or from an extra &acirc;/&acirc; at the beginning of
the path, will cause the equivalent of a cd command without
a <br>
directory name. This is unlikely to be useful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Any
&acirc;%XX&acirc; codes (per RFC 3986) within the path
components are decoded, with XX representing a character
code in hexadecimal. This decoding takes place after the
path has <br>
been split into components, but before each component is
used in the equivalent of a cd or get command. Some
often-used codes are &acirc;%2F&acirc; (which represents
&acirc;/&acirc;) and &acirc;%7E&acirc; <br>
(which represents &acirc;~&acirc;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The above interpretation has the
following consequences:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The path is
interpreted relative to the default login directory of the
specified user or of the &acirc;anonymous&acirc; user. If
the / directory is required, use a leading path of <br>
&acirc;%2F&acirc;. If a user&rsquo;s home directory is
required (and the remote server supports the syntax), use a
leading path of &acirc;%7Euser/&acirc;. For example, to
retrieve /etc/motd from <br>
&acirc;localhost&acirc; as the user &acirc;myname&acirc;
with the password &acirc;mypass&acirc;, use
&acirc;ftp://myname:mypass@localhost/%2fetc/motd&acirc;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The exact cd and
get commands can be controlled by careful choice of where to
use &acirc;/&acirc; and where to use &acirc;%2F&acirc; (or
&acirc;%2f&acirc;). For example, the following URLs
correspond to <br>
the equivalents of the indicated commands:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ftp://host/dir1/dir2/file
&acirc;cd dir1&acirc;, &acirc;cd dir2&acirc;, &acirc;get
file&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ftp://host/%2Fdir1/dir2/file
&acirc;cd /dir1&acirc;, &acirc;cd dir2&acirc;, &acirc;get
file&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ftp://host/dir1%2Fdir2/file
&acirc;cd dir1/dir2&acirc;, &acirc;get file&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ftp://host/%2Fdir1%2Fdir2/file
&acirc;cd /dir1/dir2&acirc;, &acirc;get file&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ftp://host/dir1%2Fdir2%2Ffile
&acirc;get dir1/dir2/file&acirc;.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">ftp://host/%2Fdir1%2Fdir2%2Ffile
&acirc;get /dir1/dir2/file&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; You must have
appropriate access permission for each of the intermediate
directories that is used in the equivalent of a cd
command.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">http://[user[:password]@]host[:port]/path
<br>
An HTTP URL, retrieved using the HTTP protocol. If set
http_proxy is defined, it is used as a URL to an HTTP proxy
server. If HTTP authorization is required to retrieve <br>
path, and &acirc;user&acirc; (and optionally
&acirc;password&acirc;) is in the URL, use them for the
first attempt to authenticate.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">https://[user[:password]@]host[:port]/path
<br>
An HTTPS URL, retrieved using the HTTPS protocol. If set
https_proxy is defined, it is used as a URL to an HTTPS
proxy server. If HTTPS authorization is required to <br>
retrieve path, and &acirc;user&acirc; (and optionally
&acirc;password&acirc;) is in the URL, use them for the
first attempt to authenticate. There is currently no
certificate validation and verifi&acirc; <br>
cation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file:///path <br>
A local URL, copied from /path on the local host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">about:topic <br>
Display information regarding topic; no file is retrieved
for this auto-fetched element. Supported values include:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">about:ftp Information about
ftp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">about:version The version of
ftp. Useful to provide when reporting problems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unless noted otherwise above,
and -o output is not given, the file is stored in the
current directory as the basename(1) of path. Note that if a
HTTP redirect is received, the <br>
fetch is retried using the new target URL supplied by the
server, with a corresponding new path. Using an explicit -o
output is recommended, to avoid writing to unexpected file
<br>
names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a classic format or an FTP
URL format has a trailing &acirc;/&acirc; or an empty path
component, then ftp will connect to the site and cd to the
directory given as the path, and leave the <br>
user in interactive mode ready for further input. This will
not work if set ftp_proxy is being used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Direct HTTP transfers use HTTP
1.1. Proxied FTP and HTTP transfers use HTTP 1.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If -R is given, all auto-fetches
that don&rsquo;t go via the FTP or HTTP proxies will be
restarted. For FTP, this is implemented by using reget
instead of get. For HTTP, this is imple&acirc; <br>
mented by using the &acirc;Range: bytes=&acirc; HTTP/1.1
directive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If WWW or proxy WWW
authentication is required, you will be prompted to enter a
username and password to authenticate with.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When specifying IPv6 numeric
addresses in a URL, you need to surround the address in
square brackets. E.g.: &acirc;ftp://[::1]:21/&acirc;. This
is because colons are used in IPv6 numeric <br>
address as well as being the separator for the port
number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ABORTING A FILE TRANSFER <br>
To abort a file transfer, use the terminal interrupt key
(usually Ctrl-C). Sending transfers will be immediately
halted. Receiving transfers will be halted by sending an FTP
pro&acirc; <br>
tocol ABOR command to the remote server, and discarding any
further data received. The speed at which this is
accomplished depends upon the remote server&rsquo;s support
for ABOR pro&acirc; <br>
cessing. If the remote server does not support the ABOR
command, the prompt will not appear until the remote server
has completed sending the requested file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the terminal interrupt key
sequence is used whilst ftp is awaiting a reply from the
remote server for the ABOR processing, then the connection
will be closed. This is different <br>
from the traditional behaviour (which ignores the terminal
interrupt during this phase), but is considered more
useful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILE NAMING CONVENTIONS <br>
Files specified as arguments to ftp commands are processed
according to the following rules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. If the file name
&acirc;-&acirc; is specified, the stdin (for reading) or
stdout (for writing) is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. If the first character of the
file name is &acirc;|&acirc;, the remainder of the argument
is interpreted as a shell command. ftp then forks a shell,
using popen(3) with the argument sup&acirc; <br>
plied, and reads (writes) from the stdout (stdin). If the
shell command includes spaces, the argument must be quoted;
e.g. &acirc;&quot;| ls -lt&quot;&acirc;. A particularly
useful example of <br>
this mechanism is: &acirc;dir &quot;&quot; |more&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. Failing the above checks, if
&acirc;globbing&acirc; is enabled, local file names are
expanded according to the rules used in the csh(1); see the
glob command. If the ftp command expects <br>
a single local file (e.g. put), only the first filename
generated by the &quot;globbing&quot; operation is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. For mget commands and get
commands with unspecified local file names, the local
filename is the remote filename, which may be altered by a
case, ntrans, or nmap setting. The <br>
resulting filename may then be altered if runique is on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5. For mput commands and put
commands with unspecified remote file names, the remote
filename is the local filename, which may be altered by a
ntrans or nmap setting. The <br>
resulting filename may then be altered by the remote server
if sunique is on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILE TRANSFER PARAMETERS <br>
The FTP specification specifies many parameters which may
affect a file transfer. The type may be one of
&acirc;ascii&acirc;, &acirc;image&acirc; (binary),
&acirc;ebcdic&acirc;, and &acirc;local byte size&acirc; (for
PDP-10&rsquo;s <br>
and PDP-20&rsquo;s mostly). ftp supports the ascii and image
types of file transfer, plus local byte size 8 for tenex
mode transfers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ftp supports only the default
values for the remaining file transfer parameters: mode,
form, and struct.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THE .netrc FILE <br>
The .netrc file contains login and initialization
information used by the auto-login process. It resides in
the user&rsquo;s home directory, unless overridden with the
-N netrc option, <br>
or specified in the NETRC environment variable. The
following tokens are recognized; they may be separated by
spaces, tabs, or new-lines:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">machine name <br>
Identify a remote machine name. The auto-login process
searches the .netrc file for a machine token that matches
the remote machine specified on the ftp command line or <br>
as an open command argument. Once a match is made, the
subsequent .netrc tokens are processed, stopping when the
end of file is reached or another machine or a default <br>
token is encountered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">default This is the same as
machine name except that default matches any name. There can
be only one default token, and it must be after all machine
tokens. This is normally <br>
used as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">default login anonymous password
user@site</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">thereby giving the user an
automatic anonymous FTP login to machines not specified in
.netrc. This can be overridden by using the -n flag to
disable auto-login.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">login name <br>
Identify a user on the remote machine. If this token is
present, the auto-login process will initiate a login using
the specified name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">password string <br>
Supply a password. If this token is present, the auto-login
process will supply the specified string if the remote
server requires a password as part of the login <br>
process. Note that if this token is present in the .netrc
file for any user other than anonymous, ftp will abort the
auto-login process if the .netrc is readable by any&acirc;
<br>
one besides the user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">account string <br>
Supply an additional account password. If this token is
present, the auto-login process will supply the specified
string if the remote server requires an additional <br>
account password, or the auto-login process will initiate an
ACCT command if it does not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">macdef name <br>
Define a macro. This token functions like the ftp macdef
command functions. A macro is defined with the specified
name; its contents begin with the next .netrc line and <br>
continue until a blank line (consecutive new-line
characters) is encountered. Like the other tokens in the
.netrc file, a macdef is applicable only to the machine
defi&acirc; <br>
nition preceding it. A macdef entry cannot be used by
multiple machine definitions; rather, it must be defined
following each machine it is intended to be used with. If
<br>
a macro named init is defined, it is automatically executed
as the last step in the auto-login process. For example,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">default <br>
macdef init <br>
epsv4 off</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">followed by a blank line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMAND LINE EDITING <br>
ftp supports interactive command line editing, via the
editline(3) library. It is enabled with the edit command,
and is enabled by default if input is from a tty. Previous
lines <br>
can be recalled and edited with the arrow keys, and other
GNU Emacs-style editing keys may be used as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The editline(3) library is
configured with a .editrc file - refer to editrc(5) for more
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An extra key binding is
available to ftp to provide context sensitive command and
filename completion (including remote file completion). To
use this, bind a key to the <br>
editline(3) command ftp-complete. By default, this is bound
to the TAB key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMAND LINE PROMPT <br>
By default, ftp displays a command line prompt of
&acirc;ftp&gt; &acirc; to the user. This can be changed with
the set prompt command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A prompt can be displayed on the
right side of the screen (after the command input) with the
set rprompt command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following formatting
sequences are replaced by the given information:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%/ The current remote working
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%c[[0]n],%.[[0]n] <br>
The trailing component of the current remote working
directory, or n trailing components if a digit n is given.
If n begins with &acirc;0&acirc;, the number of skipped
components <br>
precede the trailing component(s) in the format
&acirc;/&lt;number&gt;trailing&acirc; (for &acirc;%c&acirc;)
or &acirc;...trailing&acirc; (for &acirc;%.&acirc;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%M The remote host name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%m The remote host name, up to
the first &acirc;.&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%n The remote user name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%% A single &acirc;%&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
ftp uses the following environment variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FTPANONPASS Password to send in
an anonymous FTP transfer. Defaults to
&acirc;&lsquo;whoami&lsquo;@&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FTPMODE Overrides the default

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FTPPROMPT Command-line prompt to
use. Defaults to &acirc;ftp&gt; &acirc;. Refer to COMMAND
LINE PROMPT for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FTPRPROMPT Command-line right
side prompt to use. Defaults to &acirc;&acirc;. Refer to
COMMAND LINE PROMPT for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FTPSERVER Host to use as
gate-ftp server when gate is enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FTPSERVERPORT Port to use when
connecting to gate-ftp server when gate is enabled. Default
is port returned by a getservbyname() lookup of
&acirc;ftpgate/tcp&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FTPUSERAGENT The value to send
for the HTTP User-Agent header.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOME For default location of a
.netrc file, if one exists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NETRC An alternate location of
the .netrc file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PAGER Used by various commands
to display files. Defaults to more(1) if empty or not
set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SHELL For default shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ftp_proxy URL of FTP proxy to
use when making FTP URL requests (if not defined, use the
standard FTP protocol).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See http_proxy for further notes
about proxy use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">http_proxy URL of HTTP proxy to
use when making HTTP URL requests. If proxy authentication
is required and there is a username and password in this
URL, they will automati&acirc; <br>
cally be used in the first attempt to authenticate to the
proxy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If &acirc;unsafe&acirc; URL
characters are required in the username or password (for
example &acirc;@&acirc; or &acirc;/&acirc;), encode them
with RFC 3986 &acirc;%XX&acirc; encoding.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the use of a username
and password in ftp_proxy and http_proxy may be incompatible
with other programs that use it (such as lynx(1)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: this is not used for
interactive sessions, only for command-line fetches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">no_proxy A space or comma
separated list of hosts (or domains) for which proxying is
not to be used. Each entry may have an optional trailing
&quot;:port&quot;, which restricts the <br>
matching to connections to that port.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTENDED PASSIVE MODE AND
FIREWALLS <br>
Some firewall configurations do not allow ftp to use
extended passive mode. If you find that even a simple ls
appears to hang after printing a message such as this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">229 Entering Extended Passive
Mode (|||58551|)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">then you will need to disable
extended passive mode with epsv4 off. See the above section
The .netrc File for an example of how to make this
automatic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY <br>
The ftp command appeared in 4.2BSD.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Various features such as command
line editing, context sensitive command and file completion,
dynamic progress bar, automatic fetching of files and URLs,
modification time preser&acirc; <br>
vation, transfer rate throttling, configurable command line
prompt, and other enhancements over the standard BSD ftp
were implemented in NetBSD 1.3 and later releases by Luke
<br>
Mewburn &acirc;&uml;lukem@NetBSD.org&acirc;&copy;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IPv6 support was added by the
WIDE/KAME project (but may not be present in all non-NetBSD
versions of this program, depending if the operating system
supports IPv6 in a similar <br>
manner to KAME).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Correct execution of many commands depends upon proper
behavior by the remote server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An error in the treatment of
carriage returns in the 4.2BSD ascii-mode transfer code has
been corrected. This correction may result in incorrect
transfers of binary files to and <br>
from 4.2BSD servers using the ascii type. Avoid this problem
by using the binary image type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ftp assumes that all IPv4 mapped
addresses (IPv6 addresses with a form like ::ffff:10.1.1.1)
indicate IPv4 destinations which can be handled by AF_INET
sockets. However, in cer&acirc; <br>
tain IPv6 network configurations, this assumption is not
true. In such an environment, IPv4 mapped addresses must be
passed to AF_INET6 sockets directly. For example, if your
<br>
site uses a SIIT translator for IPv6-to-IPv4 translation,
ftp is unable to support your configuration.</p>
