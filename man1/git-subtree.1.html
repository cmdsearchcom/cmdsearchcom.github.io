<p>GIT-SUBTREE(1) Git Manual GIT-SUBTREE(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
git-subtree - Merge subtrees together and split repository
into subtrees</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
git subtree add -P &lt;prefix&gt; &lt;refspec&gt; <br>
git subtree add -P &lt;prefix&gt; &lt;repository&gt;
&lt;refspec&gt; <br>
git subtree pull -P &lt;prefix&gt; &lt;repository&gt;
&lt;refspec...&gt; <br>
git subtree push -P &lt;prefix&gt; &lt;repository&gt;
&lt;refspec...&gt; <br>
git subtree merge -P &lt;prefix&gt; &lt;commit&gt; <br>
git subtree split -P &lt;prefix&gt; [OPTIONS]
[&lt;commit&gt;]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Subtrees allow subprojects to be included within a
subdirectory of the main project, optionally including the
subproject&acirc;s entire history.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, you could include
the source code for a library as a subdirectory of your
application.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Subtrees are not to be confused
with submodules, which are meant for the same task. Unlike
submodules, subtrees do not need any special constructions
(like .gitmodule files or <br>
gitlinks) be present in your repository, and do not force
end-users of your repository to do anything special or to
understand how subtrees work. A subtree is just a
subdirectory <br>
that can be committed to, branched, and merged along with
your project in any way you want.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">They are also not to be confused
with using the subtree merge strategy. The main difference
is that, besides merging the other project as a
subdirectory, you can also extract the <br>
entire history of a subdirectory from your project and make
it into a standalone project. Unlike the subtree merge
strategy you can alternate back and forth between these two
<br>
operations. If the standalone library gets updated, you can
automatically merge the changes into your project; if you
update the library inside your project, you can
&quot;split&quot; the <br>
changes back out again and merge them back into the library
project.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, if a library you
made for one application ends up being useful elsewhere, you
can extract its entire history and publish that as its own
git repository, without <br>
accidentally intermingling the history of your application
project.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tip <br>
In order to keep your commit messages clean, we recommend
that people split their commits between the subtrees and the
main project as much as possible. That is, if you make <br>
a change that affects both the library and the main
application, commit it in two pieces. That way, when you
split the library commits out later, their descriptions will
<br>
still make sense. But if this isn&acirc;t important to you,
it&acirc;s not necessary. git subtree will simply leave out
the non-library-related parts of the commit when it splits
it out <br>
into the subproject later.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMANDS <br>
add <br>
Create the &lt;prefix&gt; subtree by importing its contents
from the given &lt;refspec&gt; or &lt;repository&gt; and
remote &lt;refspec&gt;. A new commit is created
automatically, joining the <br>
imported project&acirc;s history with your own. With
--squash, imports only a single commit from the subproject,
rather than its entire history.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">merge <br>
Merge recent changes up to &lt;commit&gt; into the
&lt;prefix&gt; subtree. As with normal git merge, this
doesn&acirc;t remove your own local changes; it just merges
those changes into the <br>
latest &lt;commit&gt;. With --squash, creates only one
commit that contains all the changes, rather than merging in
the entire history.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you use
&rsquo;--squash&rsquo;, the merge direction doesn&rsquo;t
<br>
always have to be forward; you can use this command to <br>
go back in time from v2.5 to v2.4, for example. If your <br>
merge introduces a conflict, you can resolve it in the <br>
usual ways.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pull <br>
Exactly like merge, but parallels git pull in that it
fetches the given commit from the specified remote
repository.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">push <br>
Does a split (see below) using the &lt;prefix&gt; supplied
and then does a git push to push the result to the
repository and refspec. This can be used to push your
subtree to <br>
different branches of the remote repository.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">split <br>
Extract a new, synthetic project history from the history of
the &lt;prefix&gt; subtree. The new history includes only
the commits (including merges) that affected &lt;prefix&gt;,
and <br>
each of those commits now has the contents of &lt;prefix&gt;
at the root of the project instead of in a subdirectory.
Thus, the newly created history is suitable for export as a
<br>
separate git repository.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After splitting successfully, a
single commit id is <br>
printed to stdout. This corresponds to the HEAD of the <br>
newly created tree, which you can manipulate however you
<br>
want.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Repeated splits of exactly the
same history are <br>
guaranteed to be identical (ie. to produce the same <br>
commit ids). Because of this, if you add new commits <br>
and then re-split, the new commits will be attached as <br>
commits on top of the history you generated last time, <br>
so &rsquo;git merge&rsquo; and friends will work as
expected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that if you use
&rsquo;--squash&rsquo; when you merge, you <br>
should usually not just &rsquo;--rejoin&rsquo; when you
split.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-q, --quiet <br>
Suppress unnecessary output messages on stderr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --debug <br>
Produce even more unnecessary output messages on stderr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P &lt;prefix&gt;,
--prefix=&lt;prefix&gt; <br>
Specify the path in the repository to the subtree you want
to manipulate. This option is mandatory for all
commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m &lt;message&gt;,
--message=&lt;message&gt; <br>
This option is only valid for add, merge and pull (unsure).
Specify &lt;message&gt; as the commit message for the merge
commit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS FOR ADD, MERGE, PUSH,
PULL <br>
--squash <br>
This option is only valid for add, merge, push and pull
commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Instead of merging the entire
history from the subtree <br>
project, produce only a single commit that contains all <br>
the differences you want to merge, and then merge that <br>
new commit into your project.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using this option helps to
reduce log clutter. People <br>
rarely want to see every change that happened between <br>
v1.0 and v1.1 of the library they&rsquo;re using, since none
of the <br>
interim versions were ever included in their
application.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using &rsquo;--squash&rsquo;
also helps avoid problems when the same <br>
subproject is included multiple times in the same <br>
project, or is removed and then re-added. In such a <br>
case, it doesn&rsquo;t make sense to combine the histories
<br>
anyway, since it&rsquo;s unclear which part of the history
<br>
belongs to which subtree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Furthermore, with
&rsquo;--squash&rsquo;, you can switch back and <br>
forth between different versions of a subtree, rather <br>
than strictly forward. &rsquo;git subtree merge
--squash&rsquo; <br>
always adjusts the subtree to match the exactly <br>
specified commit, even if getting to that commit would <br>
require undoing some changes that were added earlier.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Whether or not you use
&rsquo;--squash&rsquo;, changes made in your <br>
local repository remain intact and can be later split <br>
and send upstream to the subproject.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS FOR SPLIT <br>
--annotate=&lt;annotation&gt; <br>
This option is only valid for the split command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When generating synthetic
history, add &lt;annotation&gt; as a <br>
prefix to each commit message. Since we&rsquo;re creating
new <br>
commits with the same commit message, but possibly <br>
different content, from the original commits, this can help
<br>
to differentiate them and avoid confusion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Whenever you split, you need to
use the same <br>
&lt;annotation&gt;, or else you don&rsquo;t have a guarantee
that <br>
the new re-created history will be identical to the old <br>
one. That will prevent merging from working correctly. <br>
git subtree tries to make it work anyway, particularly <br>
if you use --rejoin, but it may not always be effective.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b &lt;branch&gt;,
--branch=&lt;branch&gt; <br>
This option is only valid for the split command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After generating the synthetic
history, create a new <br>
branch called &lt;branch&gt; that contains the new history.
<br>
This is suitable for immediate pushing upstream. <br>
&lt;branch&gt; must not already exist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ignore-joins <br>
This option is only valid for the split command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you use
&rsquo;--rejoin&rsquo;, git subtree attempts to optimize
<br>
its history reconstruction to generate only the new <br>
commits since the last &rsquo;--rejoin&rsquo;.
&rsquo;--ignore-join&rsquo; <br>
disables this behaviour, forcing it to regenerate the <br>
entire history. In a large project, this can take a <br>
long time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--onto=&lt;onto&gt; <br>
This option is only valid for the split command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If your subtree was originally
imported using something <br>
other than git subtree, its history may not match what <br>
git subtree is expecting. In that case, you can specify <br>
the commit id &lt;onto&gt; that corresponds to the first
<br>
revision of the subproject&rsquo;s history that was imported
<br>
into your project, and git subtree will attempt to build
<br>
its history from there.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you used &rsquo;git subtree
add&rsquo;, you should never need <br>
this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--rejoin <br>
This option is only valid for the split command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After splitting, merge the newly
created synthetic <br>
history back into your main project. That way, future <br>
splits can search only the part of history that has <br>
been added since the most recent --rejoin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If your split commits end up
merged into the upstream <br>
subproject, and then you want to get the latest upstream
<br>
version, this will allow git&rsquo;s merge algorithm to more
<br>
intelligently avoid conflicts (since it knows these <br>
synthetic commits are already part of the upstream <br>
repository).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unfortunately, using this option
results in &rsquo;git log&rsquo; <br>
showing an extra copy of every new commit that was <br>
created (the original, and the synthetic one).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you do all your merges with
&rsquo;--squash&rsquo;, don&rsquo;t use <br>
&rsquo;--rejoin&rsquo; when you split, because you
don&rsquo;t want the <br>
subproject&rsquo;s history to be part of your project
anyway.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLE 1. ADD COMMAND <br>
Let&acirc;s assume that you have a local repository that you
would like to add an external vendor library to. In this
case we will add the git-subtree repository as a
subdirectory of <br>
your already existing git-extensions repository in
~/git-extensions/:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git subtree add
--prefix=git-subtree --squash
git://github.com/apenwarr/git-subtree.git master</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">master needs to be a valid
remote ref and can be a different branch name</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can omit the --squash flag,
but doing so will increase the number of commits that are
incldued in your local repository.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">We now have a
~/git-extensions/git-subtree directory containing code from
the master branch of
git://github.com/apenwarr/git-subtree.git in our
git-extensions repository.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLE 2. EXTRACT A SUBTREE
USING COMMIT, MERGE AND PULL <br>
Let&acirc;s use the repository for the git source code as an
example. First, get your own copy of the git.git
repository:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git clone
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git test-git <br>
$ cd test-git</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gitweb (commit 1130ef3) was
merged into git as of commit 0a8f4f0, after which it was no
longer maintained separately. But imagine it had been
maintained separately, and we wanted <br>
to extract git&acirc;s changes to gitweb since that time, to
share with the upstream. You could do this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git subtree split
--prefix=gitweb --annotate=&rsquo;(split) &rsquo; 0a8f4f0^..
--onto=1130ef3 --rejoin --branch gitweb-latest <br>
$ gitk gitweb-latest <br>
$ git push git@github.com:whatever/gitweb.git
gitweb-latest:master</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(We use 0a8f4f0^.. because that
means &quot;all the changes from 0a8f4f0 to the current
version, including 0a8f4f0 itself.&quot;)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If gitweb had originally been
merged using git subtree add (or a previous split had
already been done with --rejoin specified) then you can do
all your splits without having to <br>
remember any weird commit ids:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git subtree split
--prefix=gitweb --annotate=&rsquo;(split) &rsquo; --rejoin
--branch gitweb-latest2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">And you can merge changes back
in from the upstream project just as easily:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git subtree pull
--prefix=gitweb git@github.com:whatever/gitweb.git
master</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Or, using --squash, you can
actually rewind to an earlier version of gitweb:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git subtree merge
--prefix=gitweb --squash gitweb-latest~10</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Then make some changes:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ date &gt;gitweb/myfile <br>
$ git add gitweb/myfile <br>
$ git commit -m &rsquo;created myfile&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">And fast forward again:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git subtree merge
--prefix=gitweb --squash gitweb-latest</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">And notice that your change is
still intact:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ ls -l gitweb/myfile</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">And you can split it out and
look at your changes versus the standard gitweb:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">git log gitweb-latest..$(git
subtree split --prefix=gitweb)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLE 3. EXTRACT A SUBTREE
USING BRANCH <br>
Suppose you have a source directory with many files and
subdirectories, and you want to extract the lib directory to
its own git project. Here&acirc;s a short way to do it:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">First, make the new repository
wherever you want:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ &lt;go to the new location&gt;
<br>
$ git init --bare</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Back in your original
directory:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git subtree split --prefix=lib
--annotate=&quot;(split)&quot; -b split</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Then push the new branch onto
the new empty repository:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git push &lt;new-repo&gt;
split:master</p>
