<p>wput(1) Internet Applications - FTP wput(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
wput - A wget-like ftp-uploader</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
wput [option]... [file]... [URL]...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Wput is a free utility that is able to upload files to a
ftp-server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Wput is non-interactive and
background-capable. It can upload files or whole directories
and is meant to be a robust client even for unstable
connections and will therefore retry <br>
to upload a file, if the connection broke.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Wput supports resuming, so it
automatically continues uploading from the point where the
previous upload stopped, meaning that you can kill Wput
anytime and it will (if the <br>
remote ftp-server supports this, being most likely the case)
finish the partial uploaded file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Wput supports connections
through proxies, allowing you to use it in an environment
that can access the internet only via a proxy or to provide
anonymity by hiding your <br>
ip-address to the server. For SOCKSv5-proxies Wput supports
also listening mode, allowing you to use port-mode ftp
through a proxy (useful if the remote ftp is behind a
firewall <br>
or a gateway).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Wput supports timestamping, so
it will (in the ideal case and if timestamping is enabled)
only upload files, that are newer than the remote-file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The upload-rate of Wput can be
restricted, so that Wput won&rsquo;t eat all available
bandwidth.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">URL-Input-Handling <br>
URLs are recognized by the ftp://-prefix</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Wput first reads the URLs from
command-line, and associates the first file with the first
URL, the second file with the second URL etc. It then
transmits the file/URL combina&acirc; <br>
tions that are already complete. Afterwards, Wput uses the
--input-file (if any) and reads the URLs using the same
sheme as above. In situations where more URLs than files are
<br>
specified, Wput tries to guess the local filename from the
URL. In case there are more files that URLs remaining, Wput
uses the last known URL for each of the files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">So you can specify e.g. one URL
and read all filenames from a file. Or use wput *.txt
ftp://host, to transfer all *.txt-files. So
doc/USAGE.examples for further examples.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To be on the safe side, it is
recommended to supply the files before the URLs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Guessing Local File <br>
If Wput has an URL without a corresponding filename, Wput
tries to guess the local file&rsquo;s location. e.g. using
wput ftp://host/directory/path/file, Wput will look out for
/direc&acirc; <br>
tory/path/file. If not found, Wput looks for
./directory/path/file, ./path/file and ./file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-V <br>
--version <br>
Display the version of wput.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h <br>
--help <br>
Print a help screen, with a short description of
wput&rsquo;s command-line options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b <br>
--background <br>
Go to background immediately after startup. If no output
file is given, wput will redirect its output to
&quot;./wputlog&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o logfile <br>
--output-file=logfile <br>
Log all messages to logfile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a logfile <br>
--append-output=logfile <br>
Append all logged messages to logfile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q <br>
--quiet <br>
Turn off Wput&rsquo;s output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v <br>
--verbose <br>
Turn on verbose output. This gives some more information
about what Wput does. If you specify this flag twice, you
get debug output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nv <br>
--less-verbose <br>
Be less verbose. That means reducing Wput&rsquo;s output to
a minimun. Specifiing this flag more often is equal to the
--quiet flag. Some people also like combining the -v and -nv
<br>
flags, being quite senseless.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i file <br>
--input-file=file <br>
Reads URLs and filenames from file. If there are URLs on the
command-line too, these will be retrieved first, unless
sorting is enabled. See also the URL-Input-Handling
sec&acirc; <br>
tion. If file is -, the URLs will be read from stdin. If you
want to pipe the contents of the file that shall be uploaded
to stdin, this cannot be done (yet). But you can <br>
use the --input-pipe flag and read the contents a) from a
named pipe -I &quot;cat named.pipe; echo &gt;
/dev/null&quot; or b) directly from the command, that
outputs the data. (See <br>
--input-pipe) Do not do things like find | wput ftp://host/
-i -! Wput would upload all files from the current directory
(since the first output of find will be &rsquo;.&rsquo;) and
<br>
afterwards each file again (since find postes its name to
Wput. And further problematic is that Wput will upload each
directory that is given by find and since find itself <br>
recurses all directories, the files would be uploaded three
times (or even more often for further subdirectories). Use
wput ftp://host/ to upload everything from the local <br>
directory. Or use find ! -type d | wput ftp://host/ -i - to
tell find, not to output directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s <br>
--sort <br>
If sorting is enabled Wput first reads all URLs from any
input-devices available and will sort them before
transmitting each file. The sorting order is: ip/hostname,
port, <br>
username, password, directory, filename. Sorting requires a
bit more memory since all data needs to be hold there.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--basename=path <br>
This option causes Wput to snip path from all input-files
when they are connected to the URL. wput /usr/share/doc.tgz
ftp://host/ would create ftp://host//usr/share/doc.tgz, <br>
whereas specifing /usr/share/ as basename will result in
ftp://host/doc.tgz being created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I command <br>
--input-pipe=command <br>
If no file/directory can be &quot;guessed&quot; (see
&quot;Guessing Local File&quot;) from the URL, the output of
command is taken as file-input. command is invoked as
follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">command ftp &quot;username&quot;
&quot;ip/hostname&quot; port &quot;remote_directory&quot;
&quot;remote_filename&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The hostname is only supplied if
the ip cannot be resolved. If you do not want these
parameters to confuse the programm from which you read the
contents, use something like <br>
&rsquo;-I &quot;cat file; echo &gt; /dev/null&quot;&rsquo;
so that these parameters are passed to echo and to /dev/null
afterwards. Since the progressbar is not capable of handling
unknown file&acirc; <br>
sizes, the filesize is set to 1 GiB. Therefore the ETA shows
a wrong value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R <br>
--remove-source-files <br>
Unlinks/deletes files that have been successfully
transmitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--bind-address=ADDRESS <br>
When making client TCP/IP connections, bind() to ADDRESS on
the local machine. ADDRESS may be specified as a hostname or
IP address. This option can be useful if your <br>
machine is bound to multiple IPs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t number <br>
--tries=number <br>
Set number of retries to number. Specify -1 for infinite
retrying. The default is to retry 3 times, with some
exceptions on fatal errors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nc <br>
--dont-continue <br>
If this flag is specified, resuming will be turned off,
meaning that a remote file being smaller than the local one
will be overwritten. To skip this file, you have to enable
<br>
--skip-existing. See also doc/USAGE.resumehandling</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u <br>
--reupload <br>
If this flag is specified, a remote file having the same
size as the local one is to be uploaded. Skipping is
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--skip-larger <br>
If this flag is specified, a remote file being larger than
the local one will be skipped. Default is reuploading
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--skip-existing <br>
If this flag is specified, the upload of a file will be
skipped if the remote file already exists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N <br>
--timestamping <br>
If timestamping is enabled, Wput will retrieve a directory
list and parse it to determine the remote file-date. If the
local file is newer than the remote one (there is a <br>
default allowed timevariance of 5 seconds, which can be
adjusted in the wputrc-file) it is uploaded, otherwise
skipped. The local date is dermined by the mtime (time of
last <br>
modification), using the current time-zone. This should be
equal to the output of ls -l. Since you usually do not want
to resume existing files, you should employ the --reu&acirc;
<br>
pload --dont-continue flags as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l RATE <br>
--limit-rate=RATE <br>
If you don&rsquo;t want Wput to eat up all available
bandwidth, specify this flag. RATE is a numeric value. The
units &rsquo;K&rsquo; (for KiB) and &rsquo;M&rsquo; (for
MiB) are understood. The upload <br>
rate is limited on average, meaning that if you limit the
rate to 10K and Wput was just able to send with 5K for the
first seconds, it will send (if possible) afterwards more
<br>
than 10K until the average rate of 10K is fulfilled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-directories <br>
If Wput is unable to CWD into a directory, it will try to
create it. If this is not the desired behaviour specify this
flag to force Wput not to create any directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Y MODE <br>
--proxy=MODE <br>
MODE can be either http for http-based proxies (such as
SQUID), socks for SOCKSv5 proxies or off to disable the
proxy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--proxy-user=NAME <br>
If the proxy-server requires authentication, use NAME as
user-name. You need to specify --proxy-pass too. These
information can also be stored in the wputrc-file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--proxy-pass=PASS <br>
Specifies the password to use for the proxy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p <br>
--port-mode <br>
Per default, Wput uses passive mode ftp, which works well
for most configurations. If passive mode fails, Wput
automatically falls back to port mode. If you want Wput to
<br>
start using port mode ftp, specify this flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A <br>
--ascii <br>
Wput automatically determines which transfer-format to use,
by looking at the file-extensions. Certain files are
recognized as ASCII. These are: txt, c, java, cpp, sh, f,
<br>
f90, f77, f95, bas&quot;, pro, csh, ksh, conf, htm, html,
php, pl, cgi, inf, js, asp, bat, cfm, css, dhtml, diz, h,
hpp, ini, mak, nfo, shtml, shtm, tcl, pas Specifying this
flag <br>
forces Wput to use ASCII mode file transfers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B <br>
--binary <br>
Specifiing this flag forces Wput to use BINARY mode file
transfers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--force-tls <br>
If this flag is specified and Wput is linked with the
OpenSSL-library, the flag enforces the usage of TLS: If no
TLS-connection can be established the process will cancel
and <br>
not try to go on with an unencrypted connection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
Normally, the exit status is 0 if either everything went
fine or there was nothing to do. If some files were skipped
during the upload (due to timestamping or resume-rules) the
<br>
exit status is set to 1. If some files failed to be
transmitted due to an remote error, exit status is 2. If
some files failed and some others were skipped, exit status
is 3. For <br>
general problems like failure of some system-functions the
exit status is 4.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
You are welcome to send bug reports and suggestions about
Wput through the Sourceforge Bugtracking System:
http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=141519</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please send all available
information that might concern this bug (e.g. Operating
System and what can be done to reproduce the error). Supply
also the debug-output (but remove <br>
confidential data if any), which helps a lot analysing the
problem. If you use a wputrc file, it might also be useful
to provide the relevant parts of it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If there is a crash due to a
segfault or similar, try to run it in a debugger, e.g. gdb
&lsquo;which wput&lsquo; core and type where to get the
backtrace. It would also be great help if you <br>
could recompile wput with memory-debugging support (make
clean; make memdbg; [make install]) and use this
debug-dump.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
Many options can be set in a wputrc file. For its
documentation consult the sample file provided by Wput.
There are some USAGE.* files in the doc/ directory of Wput.
These con&acirc; <br>
tain further information and samples on how to use Wput.
