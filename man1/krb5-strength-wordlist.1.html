<p>KRB5-STRENGTH-WORDLIST(1) krb5-strength
KRB5-STRENGTH-WORDLIST(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
krb5-strength-wordlist - Create a krb5-strength database
from a word list</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
krb5-strength-wordlist [-am] [-c output-cdb] [-l min-length]
<br>
[-L max-length] [-o output-wordlist] [-s output-sqlite] <br>
[-x exclude ...] wordlist</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
krb5-strength-wordlist converts a word list (a file
containing one word per line) into a database that can be
used by the krb5-strength plugin or heimdal-strength command
for <br>
checking passwords. Two database formats are supported, with
different features. CDB is more space-efficient and possibly
faster, but supports checking passwords only against <br>
exact matches or simple transformations (removing small
numbers of leading and trailing characters). SQLite creates
a much larger database, but supports rejecting any password
<br>
within edit distance one of a word in the word list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CDB is a format invented by Dan
Bernstein for fast, constant databases. The database is
fixed during creation and cannot be changed without
rebuilding it, and is optimized for <br>
very fast access. For cdb, the database generated by this
program will have keys for each word in the word list and
the constant 1 as the value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SQLite stores the word list in a
single table containing both each word and each word
reversed. This allows the krb5-strength plugin or
heimdal-strength command to reject <br>
passwords within edit distance one of any word in the word
list. (Edit distance one means that the word list entry can
be formed by changing a single character of the password,
<br>
either by adding one character, removing one character, or
changing one character to a different character.) However,
the SQLite database will be much larger and lookups may be
<br>
somewhat slower.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">krb5-strength-wordlist takes one
argument, the input word list file. Use the -c option to
specify an output CDB file, -s to specify an output SQLite
file, or -o to just filter <br>
the word list against the criteria given on the command line
and generate a new word list. The input word list file does
not have to be sorted. See the individual option <br>
descriptions for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-a, --ascii <br>
Filter all words that contain non-ASCII characters or
control characters from the resulting cdb file, leaving only
words that consist solely of ASCII non-control
characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c output-cdb, --cdb=output-cdb
<br>
Create a CDB database in output-cdb. A temporary file named
after output-cdb with &quot;.data&quot; appended will be
created in the same directory and used to stage the database
<br>
contents. The actual CDB file will be built using the cdb
command, which must be on the user&rsquo;s path. If either
file already exists, krb5-strength-wordlist will abort with
<br>
an error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option cannot be used with
-o or -s.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L maximum, --max-length=maximum
<br>
Filter all words of length greater than maximum from the
resulting cdb database. The length of each line (minus the
separating newline) in the input word list will be <br>
checked against minimum and will be filtered out of the
resulting database if it is shorter. Useful for generating
password dictionaries from word lists that contain random
<br>
noise that&rsquo;s highly unlikely to be used as a
password.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is to not filter out
any words for maximum length.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l minimum, --min-length=minimum
<br>
Filter all words of length less than minimum from the
resulting cdb database. The length of each line (minus the
separating newline) in the input word list will be checked
<br>
against minimum and will be filtered out of the resulting
database if it is shorter. Useful for generating password
dictionaries where shorter passwords will be rejected by
<br>
a generic length check and no dictionary lookup will be done
for a transform of the password shorter than the specified
minimum.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is not to filter out
any words for minimum length.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m, --man, --manual <br>
Print out this documentation (which is done simply by
feeding the script to &quot;perldoc -t&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o wordlist, --output=wordlist
<br>
Rather than creating a database, apply the filter rules
given by the other command-line arguments and generate a new
word list in the file name given by the wordlist option.
<br>
This can be used to reduce the size of a raw word list file
(such as one taken from Internet sources) by removing the
words that will be filtered out of the dictionary <br>
anyway, thus reducing the size of the source required to
regenerate the dictionary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option cannot be used with
-c or -s.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s output-sqlite,
--sqlite=output-sqlite <br>
Create a SQLite database in output-sqlite. If this file
already exists, krb5-strength-wordlist will abort with an
error. The resulting SQLite database will have one table,
<br>
&quot;passwords&quot;, with two columns,
&quot;password&quot; and &quot;drowssap&quot;. The first
holds a word from the word list, and the second holds the
same word reversed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using this option requires the
DBI and DBD::SQLite Perl modules be installed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option cannot be used with
-c or -o.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x exclude, --exclude=exclude
<br>
Filter all words matching the regular expression exclude
from the resulting cdb database. This regular expression
will be matched against each line of the source word list
<br>
after the trailing newline is removed. This option may be
given repeatedly to add multiple exclusion regexes.</p>
