dcl2inc - postprocess ftnchek .dcl files to create separate INCLUDE files
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<b>dcl2inc</b> <i>*.dcl</i>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>dcl2inc</b> postprocessing declaration files output by <b>ftnchek</b>(1),
  replacing unique COMMON block definitions by Fortran <i>INCLUDE</i>
  statements. For each input <i>.dcl</i> file, a modified output <i>.dcn</i>
  file is produced, together with include files named by the COMMON block name,
  with filename extension <i>.inc</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In addition, <b>dcl2inc</b> produces on <i>stdout</i> a list of <i>Makefile</i>
  dependencies for the UNIX <b>make</b>(1) utility. These can be appended to the
  project <i>Makefile</i> to ensure that any subsequent changes to <i>.inc</i>
  files provoke recompilation of source files that include them.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>dcl2inc</b> warns about COMMONs which differ from their first occurrence, and
  simply copies them to the output <i>.dcn</i> file, instead of replacing them
  with an INCLUDE statement. Thus, any COMMON statements that are found in the
  output <i>.dcn</i> files should be examined carefully to determine why they
  differ: they may well be in error.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Replication of identical data, and bugs arising from subsequent modification of
  only part of it, is a significant reason why Fortran programming projects
  should <i>require</i> that COMMON declarations occur in separate include
  files, so that there is only a <i>single</i> point of definition of any global
  object.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Even though the Fortran <i>INCLUDE</i> statement was tragically omitted from the
  1977 Standard, it has long been implemented by virtually all compiler vendors,
  and is part of the 1990 Standard. In practice, there is therefore no
  portability problem associated with use of INCLUDE statements, <i>provided</i>
  that one avoids nonportable file names. As long as the code obeys Fortran's
  limit of six-character alphanumeric names, the filenames generated by
  <b>dcl2inc</b> will be acceptable on all current popular operating systems.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Fortran's default, or IMPLICIT, variable typing is deprecated in modern
  programming languages, because it encourages sloppy documentation, and worse,
  bugs due to misspelled variables, or variables that have been truncated
  because they extend past column 72. If all variables used are explicitly
  typed, and a compiler option is used to reject all program units with untyped
  variables, variable spelling and truncation errors can be eliminated.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Variable declarations that have been produced automatically by a tool like
  <b>ftnchek</b>(1) or <b>pfort</b>(1) have a consistent format that facilitates
  application of stream editors (e.g. to change array dimensions or rename
  variables), and simple floating-point precision conversion tools like
  <b>d2s</b>(1), <b>dtoq</b>(1), <b>dtos</b>(1), <b>qtod</b>(1), <b>s2d</b>(1),
  and <b>stod</b>(1).
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CAVEAT"><a class="selflink" href="#CAVEAT">CAVEAT</a></h1>
The current version (2.9) of <b>ftnchek</b>(1) does not produce Fortran
  EQUIVALENCE statements in <i>.dcl</i> files, so you must be careful to
  preserve them when replacing original declarations with new ones from
  <i>.dcl</i> or <i>.dcn</i> files.
