<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
dcl2inc - postprocess ftnchek .dcl files to create separate
INCLUDE files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
dcl2inc *.dcl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
dcl2inc postprocessing declaration files output by
ftnchek(1), replacing unique COMMON block definitions by
Fortran INCLUDE statements. For each input .dcl file, a
modified out&acirc; <br>
put .dcn file is produced, together with include files named
by the COMMON block name, with filename extension .inc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition, dcl2inc produces on
stdout a list of Makefile dependencies for the UNIX make(1)
utility. These can be appended to the project Makefile to
ensure that any subsequent <br>
changes to .inc files provoke recompilation of source files
that include them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dcl2inc warns about COMMONs
which differ from their first occurrence, and simply copies
them to the output .dcn file, instead of replacing them with
an INCLUDE statement. Thus, <br>
any COMMON statements that are found in the output .dcn
files should be examined carefully to determine why they
differ: they may well be in error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Replication of identical data,
and bugs arising from subsequent modification of only part
of it, is a significant reason why Fortran programming
projects should require that COM&acirc; <br>
MON declarations occur in separate include files, so that
there is only a single point of definition of any global
object.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Even though the Fortran INCLUDE
statement was tragically omitted from the 1977 Standard, it
has long been implemented by virtually all compiler vendors,
and is part of the 1990 <br>
Standard. In practice, there is therefore no portability
problem associated with use of INCLUDE statements, provided
that one avoids nonportable file names. As long as the code
<br>
obeys Fortran&rsquo;s limit of six-character alphanumeric
names, the filenames generated by dcl2inc will be acceptable
on all current popular operating systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fortran&rsquo;s default, or
IMPLICIT, variable typing is deprecated in modern
programming languages, because it encourages sloppy
documentation, and worse, bugs due to misspelled vari&acirc;
<br>
ables, or variables that have been truncated because they
extend past column 72. If all variables used are explicitly
typed, and a compiler option is used to reject all program
<br>
units with untyped variables, variable spelling and
truncation errors can be eliminated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Variable declarations that have
been produced automatically by a tool like ftnchek(1) or
pfort(1) have a consistent format that facilitates
application of stream editors (e.g. to <br>
change array dimensions or rename variables), and simple
floating-point precision conversion tools like d2s(1),
dtoq(1), dtos(1), qtod(1), s2d(1), and stod(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CAVEAT <br>
The current version (2.9) of ftnchek(1) does not produce
Fortran EQUIVALENCE statements in .dcl files, so you must be
careful to preserve them when replacing original
declara&acirc; <br>
tions with new ones from .dcl or .dcn files.</p>
