<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ext2spice - convert hierarchical ext(5) extracted-circuit
files to flat spice files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ext2spice [ -B ] [ extcheck-options ] [ -M|m ] [ -y num ] [
-f hspice|spice3|spice2 ] [ -J hier|flat ] [ -j
device:sdRclass[/subRclass]/defaultSubstrate ] root</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Ext2spice will convert an extracted circuit from the
hierarchical ext(5) representation produced by Magic to a
flat spice file which can be accepted by spice2, spice3,
hspice and <br>
other simulation tools. The root of the tree to be extracted
is the file root.ext; it and all the files it references are
recursively flattened. The result is a single, flat <br>
representation of the circuit that is written to the file
root.spice .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options are
recognized:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o outfile <br>
Instead of leaving output in the file root.spice, leave it
in outfile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B Don&rsquo;t output transistor
or node attributes in the spice file. Usually the attributes
of a node or a device are output as special comments
**fetattr and **nodeatrr <br>
which can be processed further to create things such a
initial conditions etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F Don&rsquo;t output nodes that
aren&rsquo;t connected to fets (floating nodes). Normally
capacitance from these nodes is output with the comment
**FLOATING attached on the same <br>
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-tchar Trim characters from node
names when writing the output file. Char should be either
&quot;#&quot; or &quot;!&quot;. The option may be used twice
if both characters are desired. Trimming <br>
&quot;#&quot; and &quot;!&quot; is enabled by default when
the format is hspice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M|m Merge parallel fets. -m
means conservative merging of fets that have equal widths
only (usefull with hspice format multiplier if delta W
effects need to be taken care <br>
of). -M means aggresive merging: the fets are merged if they
have the same terminals and the same length.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-y num Select the precision for
outputing capacitors. The default is 1 which means that the
capacitors will be printed to a precision of .1 fF.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f hspice|spice2|spice3 <br>
Select the output format. Spice3 is the the format
understood by the latest version of berkeley spice. Node
names have the same names as they would in a sim(5) file and
<br>
no special constructs are used. Spice2 is the format
understood by the older version of spice (which usually has
better convergence). Node names are numbers and a dic&acirc;
<br>
tionary of number and corresponding node is output in the
end. HSPICE is a format understood by meta-software&rsquo;s
hspice and other commercial tools. In this format node <br>
names cannot be longer than 15 characters long (blame the
fortran code): so if a hierarchical node name is longer it
is truncated to something like x1234/name where <br>
x1234 is an alias of the normal node hierarchical prefix and
name its hierarchical postfix (a dictionary mapping prefixes
to real hierarchical paths is output at the <br>
end of the spice file). If the node name is still longer
than 15 characters long (again blame the fortran code) it is
translated to something like z@1234 and the equiv&acirc;
<br>
alent name is output as a comment. In addition since hspice
supports scaling and multipliers so the output dimensions
are in lambdas and if parallel fets are merged the <br>
hspice construct M is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-J hier|flat <br>
Select the source/drain area and perimeter extraction
algorithm. If hier is selected then the areas and perimeters
are extracted only within each subcell. For each fet <br>
in a subcell the area and perimeter of its source and drain
within this subcell are output. If two or more fets share a
source/drain node then the total area and <br>
perimeter will be output in only one of them and the other
will have 0. If flat is selected the same rules apply only
that the scope of search for area and perimeter <br>
is the whole netlist. In general flat (which is the default)
will give accurate results (it will take into account shared
sources/drains) but hier is provided for back&acirc; <br>
wards compatibility with version 6.4.5. On top of this
selection you can individually control how a terminal of a
specific fet will be extracted if you put a <br>
source/drain attribute. ext:aph makes the extraction for
that specific terminal hierarchical and ext:apf makes the
extraction flat (see the magic tutorial about attach&acirc;
<br>
ing attribute labels). Additionaly to ease extraction of
bipolar transistors the gate attribute ext:aps forces the
output of the substrate area and perimeter for a <br>
specific fet (in flat mode only).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-j
device:sdRclass[/subRclass]/defaultSubstrate <br>
Gives ext2sim information about the source/drain resistance
class of the fet type device. Makes device to have sdRclass
source drain resistance class, subRclass sub&acirc; <br>
strate (well) resistance class and the node named
defaultSubstrate as its default substrate. The defaults are
nfet:0/Gnd and pfet:1/6/Vdd which correspond to the MOSIS
<br>
technology file but things might vary in your site. Ask your
local cad administrator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The way the extraction of node
area and perimeter works in magic the total area and
perimeter of the source/drain junction is summed up on a
single node. That is why all the <br>
junction areas and perimeters are summed up on a single node
(this should not affect simulation results however).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Special care must be taken when
the substrate of a fet is tied to a node other than the
default substrate (eg in a bootstraping charge pump). To get
the correct substrate info <br>
in these cases the fet(s) with separate wells should be in
their own separate subcell with ext:aph attributes attached
to their sensitive terminals (also all the transistors <br>
which share sensistive terminals with these should be in
another subcell with the same attributes).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition, all of the options
of extcheck(1) are accepted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The awk filter spice2sim is
provided with the current distribution for debugging
purposes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
The areas and perimeters of fet sources and drains work only
with the simple extraction algorith and not with the
extresis flow. So you have to model them as linear
capacitors <br>
(create a special extraction style) if you want to extract
parasitic resistances with extresis.</p>
