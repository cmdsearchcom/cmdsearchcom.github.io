Ext2spice will convert an extracted circuit from the hierarchical <i>ext</i>(5)
  representation produced by Magic to a flat spice file which can be accepted by
  spice2, spice3, hspice and other simulation tools. The root of the tree to be
  extracted is the file <i>root</i><b>.ext</b>; it and all the files it
  references are recursively flattened. The result is a single, flat
  representation of the circuit that is written to the file
  <i>root</i><b>.spice</b> .

</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-B</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Don't output transistor or node attributes in the spice
      file. Usually the attributes of a node or a device are output as special
      comments **fetattr and **nodeatrr which can be processed further to create

</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-F</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Don't output nodes that aren't connected to fets (floating
      nodes). Normally capacitance from these nodes is output with the comment

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-t<i>char</i></b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Trim characters from node names when writing the output

  <dd class="It-tag">Merge parallel fets. <i>-m</i> means conservative merging

      if delta W effects need to be taken care of). -M means aggresive merging:
      the fets are merged if they have the same terminals and the same
    length.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-y <i>num</i></b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Select the precision for outputing capacitors. The default

</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-f <i>hspice|spice2|spice3</i></b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Select the output format. Spice3 is the the format
      understood by the latest version of berkeley spice. Node names have the
      same names as they would in a <i>sim</i>(5) file and no special constructs
      are used. Spice2 is the format understood by the older version of spice
      (which usually has better convergence). Node names are numbers and a
      dictionary of number and corresponding node is output in the end. HSPICE
      is a format understood by meta-software's hspice and other commercial
      tools. In this format node names cannot be longer than 15 characters long
      (blame the fortran code): so if a hierarchical node name is longer it is
      truncated to something like x1234/name where x1234 is an alias of the
      normal node hierarchical prefix and name its hierarchical postfix (a
      dictionary mapping prefixes to real hierarchical paths is output at the
      end of the spice file). If the node name is still longer than 15
      characters long (again blame the fortran code) it is translated to
      something like z@1234 and the equivalent name is output as a comment. In
      addition since hspice supports scaling and multipliers so the output
      dimensions are in lambdas and if parallel fets are merged the hspice
      construct <i>M</i> is used.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-J <i>hier|flat</i></b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Select the source/drain area and perimeter extraction
      algorithm. If <i>hier</i> is selected then the areas and perimeters are
      extracted <i>only within each subcell</i>. For each fet in a subcell the
      area and perimeter of its source and drain within this subcell are output.
      If two or more fets share a source/drain node then the total area and
      perimeter will be output in only one of them and the other will have 0. If
      <i>flat</i> is selected the same rules apply only that the scope of search
      for area and perimeter is the whole netlist. In general <i>flat</i> (which
      is the default) will give accurate results (it will take into account
      shared sources/drains) but hier is provided for backwards compatibility
      with version 6.4.5. On top of this selection you can individually control
      how a terminal of a specific fet will be extracted if you put a
      source/drain attribute. <i>ext:aph</i> makes the extraction for that
      specific terminal hierarchical and <i>ext:apf</i> makes the extraction
      flat (see the magic tutorial about attaching attribute labels).
      Additionaly to ease extraction of bipolar transistors the gate attribute
      <i>ext:aps</i> forces the output of the substrate area and perimeter for a
      specific fet (in flat mode only).</dd>

      <i>sdRclass</i> source drain resistance class, <i>subRclass</i> substrate

      default substrate. The defaults are nfet:0/Gnd! and pfet:1/6/Vdd! which
      correspond to the MOSIS technology file but things might vary in your

The way the extraction of node area and perimeter works in magic the total area
  and perimeter of the source/drain junction is summed up on a single node. That
  is why all the junction areas and perimeters are summed up on a single node
  (this should not affect simulation results however).
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Special care must be taken when the substrate of a fet is tied to a</i>
  <i>node other than the default substrate</i> (eg in a bootstraping charge
  pump). To get the correct substrate info in these cases the fet(s) with
  separate wells should be in their own separate subcell with ext:aph attributes
  attached to their sensitive terminals (also all the transistors which share
  sensistive terminals with these should be in another subcell with the same
  attributes).

The areas and perimeters of fet sources and drains work only with the simple
  extraction algorith and not with the extresis flow. So you have to model them
  as linear capacitors (create a special extraction style) if you want to
  extract parasitic resistances with extresis.</div>
