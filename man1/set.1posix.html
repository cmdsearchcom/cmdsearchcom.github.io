<p>SET(1POSIX) POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s Manual
SET(1POSIX)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROLOG <br>
This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s
Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of <br>
Linux behavior), or the interface may not be implemented on
Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
set &acirc; set or unset options and positional
parameters</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
set [&acirc;abCefhmnuvx] [&acirc;o option] [argument...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set [+abCefhmnuvx] [+o option]
[argument...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set &acirc;&acirc;
[argument...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set &acirc;o</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set +o</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
If no options or arguments are specified, set shall write
the names and values of all shell variables in the collation
sequence of the current locale. Each name shall start on a
<br>
separate line, using the format:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;%s=%s0, &lt;name&gt;,
&lt;value&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The value string shall be
written with appropriate quoting; see the description of
shell quoting in Section 2.2, Quoting. The output shall be
suitable for reinput to the shell, <br>
setting or resetting, as far as possible, the variables that
are currently set; read-only variables cannot be reset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When options are specified, they
shall set or unset attributes of the shell, as described
below. When arguments are specified, they cause positional
parameters to be set or <br>
unset, as described below. Setting or unsetting attributes
and positional parameters are not necessarily related
actions, but they can be combined in a single invocation of
set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The set special built-in shall
support the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008,
Section 12.2, Utility Syntax Guidelines except that options
can be specified with either a <br>
leading &lt;hyphen&gt; (meaning enable the option) or
&lt;plus-sign&gt; (meaning disable it) unless otherwise
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Implementations shall support
the options in the following list in both their
&lt;hyphen&gt; and &lt;plus-sign&gt; forms. These options
can also be specified as options to sh.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;a When this option is on,
the export attribute shall be set for each variable to which
an assignment is performed; see the Base Definitions volume
of POSIX.1&acirc;2008, Section <br>
4.22, Variable Assignment. If the assignment precedes a
utility name in a command, the export attribute shall not
persist in the current execution environment after the <br>
utility completes, with the exception that preceding one of
the special built-in utilities causes the export attribute
to persist after the built-in has completed. If the <br>
assignment does not precede a utility name in the command,
or if the assignment is a result of the operation of the
getopts or read utilities, the export attribute shall <br>
persist until the variable is unset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;b This option shall be
supported if the implementation supports the User
Portability Utilities option. It shall cause the shell to
notify the user asynchronously of back&acirc; <br>
ground job completions. The following message is written to
standard error:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;[%d]%c %s%s0,
&lt;job-number&gt;, &lt;current&gt;, &lt;status&gt;,
&lt;job-name&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where the fields shall be as
follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;current&gt; The character
&rsquo;+&rsquo; identifies the job that would be used as a
default for the fg or bg utilities; this job can also be
specified using the job_id &quot;%+&quot; or &quot;%%&quot;.
<br>
The character &rsquo;&acirc;&rsquo; identifies the job that
would become the default if the current default job were to
exit; this job can also be specified using the job_id <br>
&quot;%&acirc;&quot;. For other jobs, this field is a
&lt;space&gt;. At most one job can be identified with
&rsquo;+&rsquo; and at most one job can be identified with
&rsquo;&acirc;&rsquo;. If there is any <br>
suspended job, then the current job shall be a suspended
job. If there are at least two suspended jobs, then the
previous job also shall be a suspended job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;job-number&gt; <br>
A number that can be used to identify the process group to
the wait, fg, bg, and kill utilities. Using these utilities,
the job can be identified by prefixing <br>
the job number with &rsquo;%&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;status&gt; Unspecified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;job-name&gt;
Unspecified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the shell notifies the user
a job has been completed, it may remove the job&rsquo;s
process ID from the list of those known in the current shell
execution environment; see <br>
Section 2.9.3.1, Examples. Asynchronous notification shall
not be enabled by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;C (Uppercase C.) Prevent
existing files from being overwritten by the shell&rsquo;s
&rsquo;&gt;&rsquo; redirection operator (see Section 2.7.2,
Redirecting Output); the &quot;&gt;|&quot; redirection
operator <br>
shall override this noclobber option for an individual
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;e When this option is on,
when any command fails (for any of the reasons listed in
Section 2.8.1, Consequences of Shell Errors or by returning
an exit status greater than <br>
zero), the shell immediately shall exit with the following
exceptions:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. The failure of any individual
command in a multi-command pipeline shall not cause the
shell to exit. Only the failure of the pipeline itself shall
be considered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. The &acirc;e setting shall be
ignored when executing the compound list following the
while, until, if, or elif reserved word, a pipeline
beginning with the ! reserved word, <br>
or any command of an AND-OR list other than the last.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. If the exit status of a
compound command other than a subshell command was the
result of a failure while &acirc;e was being ignored, then
&acirc;e shall not apply to this command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This requirement applies to the
shell environment and each subshell environment separately.
For example, in:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set -e; (false; echo one) | cat;
echo two</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">the false command causes the
subshell to exit without executing echo one; however, echo
two is executed because the exit status of the pipeline
(false; echo one) | cat is <br>
zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;f The shell shall disable
pathname expansion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;h Locate and remember
utilities invoked by functions as those functions are
defined (the utilities are normally located when the
function is executed).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;m This option shall be
supported if the implementation supports the User
Portability Utilities option. All jobs shall be run in their
own process groups. Immediately before <br>
the shell issues a prompt after completion of the background
job, a message reporting the exit status of the background
job shall be written to standard error. If a fore&acirc;
<br>
ground job stops, the shell shall write a message to
standard error to that effect, formatted as described by the
jobs utility. In addition, if a job changes status other
<br>
than exiting (for example, if it stops for input or output
or is stopped by a SIGSTOP signal), the shell shall write a
similar message immediately prior to writing the next <br>
prompt. This option is enabled by default for interactive
shells.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;n The shell shall read
commands but does not execute them; this can be used to
check for shell script syntax errors. An interactive shell
may ignore this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;o Write the current
settings of the options to standard output in an unspecified
format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+o Write the current option
settings to standard output in a format that is suitable for
reinput to the shell as commands that achieve the same
options settings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;o option <br>
This option is supported if the system supports the User
Portability Utilities option. It shall set various options,
many of which shall be equivalent to the single option <br>
letters. The following values of option shall be
supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">allexport Equivalent to
&acirc;a.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">errexit Equivalent to
&acirc;e.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ignoreeof Prevent an interactive
shell from exiting on end-of-file. This setting prevents
accidental logouts when &lt;control&gt;&acirc;D is entered.
A user shall explicitly exit to <br>
leave the interactive shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">monitor Equivalent to &acirc;m.
This option is supported if the system supports the User
Portability Utilities option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">noclobber Equivalent to &acirc;C
(uppercase C).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">noglob Equivalent to
&acirc;f.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">noexec Equivalent to
&acirc;n.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nolog Prevent the entry of
function definitions into the command history; see Command
History List.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">notify Equivalent to
&acirc;b.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nounset Equivalent to
&acirc;u.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">verbose Equivalent to
&acirc;v.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vi Allow shell command line
editing using the built-in vi editor. Enabling vi mode shall
disable any other command line editing mode provided as an
implementation <br>
extension.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It need not be possible to set
vi mode on for certain block-mode terminals.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xtrace Equivalent to
&acirc;x.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;u When the shell tries to
expand an unset parameter other than the &rsquo;@&rsquo; and
&rsquo;*&rsquo; special parameters, it shall write a message
to standard error and shall not execute the com&acirc; <br>
mand containing the expansion, but for the purposes of
setting the &rsquo;?&rsquo; special parameter and the exit
status of the shell the command shall be treated as having
been exe&acirc; <br>
cuted and returned an exit status of between 1 and 125
inclusive. A non-interactive shell shall immediately exit.
An interactive shell shall not exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;v The shell shall write
its input to standard error as it is read.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;x The shell shall write
to standard error a trace for each command after it expands
the command and before it executes it. It is unspecified
whether the command that turns <br>
tracing off is traced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default for all these
options shall be off (unset) unless stated otherwise in the
description of the option or unless the shell was invoked
with them on; see sh.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The remaining arguments shall be
assigned in order to the positional parameters. The special
parameter &rsquo;#&rsquo; shall be set to reflect the number
of positional parameters. All posi&acirc; <br>
tional parameters shall be unset before any new values are
assigned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the first argument is
&rsquo;&acirc;&rsquo;, the results are unspecified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The special argument
&quot;&acirc;&acirc;&quot; immediately following the set
command name can be used to delimit the arguments if the
first argument begins with &rsquo;+&rsquo; or
&rsquo;&acirc;&rsquo;, or to prevent inadvertent <br>
listing of all shell variables when there are no arguments.
The command set &acirc;&acirc; without argument shall unset
all positional parameters and set the special parameter
&rsquo;#&rsquo; to zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>

Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following sections are
informative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">APPLICATION USAGE <br>
Application writers should avoid relying on set &acirc;e
within functions. For example, in the following script:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set -e <br>
start() { <br>
some_server <br>
echo some_server started successfully <br>
} <br>
start || echo &gt;&amp;2 some_server failed</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">the &acirc;e setting is ignored
within the function body (because the function is a command
in an AND-OR list other than the last). Therefore, if
some_server fails, the function car&acirc; <br>
ries on to echo &quot;some_serverstartedsuccessfully&quot;,
and the exit status of the function is zero (which means
&quot;some_serverfailed&quot; is not output).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Write out all variables and their values:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Set $1, $2, and $3 and set
&quot;$#&quot; to 3:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set c a b</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Turn on the &acirc;x and
&acirc;v options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set &acirc;xv</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unset all positional
parameters:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set &acirc;&acirc;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Set $1 to the value of x, even
if it begins with &rsquo;&acirc;&rsquo; or
&rsquo;+&rsquo;:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set &acirc;&acirc;
&quot;$x&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Set the positional parameters to
the expansion of x, even if x expands with a leading
&rsquo;&acirc;&rsquo; or &rsquo;+&rsquo;:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set &acirc;&acirc; $x</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RATIONALE <br>
The set &acirc;&acirc; form is listed specifically in the
SYNOPSIS even though this usage is implied by the Utility
Syntax Guidelines. The explanation of this feature removes
any ambiguity <br>
about whether the set &acirc;&acirc; form might be
misinterpreted as being equivalent to set without any
options or arguments. The functionality of this form has
been adopted from the Korn&acirc; <br>
Shell. In System V, set &acirc;&acirc; only unsets
parameters if there is at least one argument; the only way
to unset all parameters is to use shift. Using the KornShell
version should not <br>
affect System V scripts because there should be no reason to
issue it without arguments deliberately; if it were issued
as, for example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set &acirc;&acirc;
&quot;$@&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and there were in fact no
arguments resulting from &quot;$@&quot;, unsetting the
parameters would have no result.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The set + form in early
proposals was omitted as being an unnecessary duplication of
set alone and not widespread historical practice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The noclobber option was changed
to allow set &acirc;C as well as the set &acirc;o noclobber
option. The single-letter version was added so that the
historical &quot;$&acirc;&quot; paradigm would not be <br>
broken; see Section 2.5.2, Special Parameters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The description of the &acirc;e
option is intended to match the behavior of the 1988 version
of the KornShell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &acirc;h flag is related to
command name hashing. See hash.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following set flags were
omitted intentionally with the following rationale:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;k The &acirc;k flag was
originally added by the author of the Bourne shell to make
it easier for users of pre-release versions of the shell. In
early versions of the Bourne shell <br>
the construct set name=value had to be used to assign values
to shell variables. The problem with &acirc;k is that the
behavior affects parsing, virtually precluding writing any
<br>
compilers. To explain the behavior of &acirc;k, it is
necessary to describe the parsing algorithm, which is
implementation-defined. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set &acirc;k; echo
name=value</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set &acirc;k <br>
echo name=value</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">behave differently. The
interaction with functions is even more complex. What is
more, the &acirc;k flag is never needed, since the command
line could have been reordered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;t The &acirc;t flag is
hard to specify and almost never used. The only known use
could be done with here-documents. Moreover, the behavior
with ksh and sh differs. The reference <br>
page says that it exits after reading and executing one
command. What is one command? If the input is date;date, sh
executes both date commands while ksh does only the <br>
first.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Consideration was given to
rewriting set to simplify its confusing syntax. A specific
suggestion was that the unset utility should be used to
unset options instead of using the <br>
non-getopt()-able +option syntax. However, the conclusion
was reached that the historical practice of using +option
was satisfactory and that there was no compelling reason to
<br>
modify such widespread historical practice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &acirc;o option was adopted
from the KornShell to address user needs. In addition to its
generally friendly interface, &acirc;o is needed to provide
the vi command line editing mode, for <br>
which historical practice yields no single-letter option
name. (Although it might have been possible to invent such a
letter, it was recognized that other editing modes would be
<br>
developed and &acirc;o provides ample name space for
describing such extensions.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Historical implementations are
inconsistent in the format used for &acirc;o option status
reporting. The +o format without an option-argument was
added to allow portable access to the <br>
options that can be saved and then later restored using, for
instance, a dot script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Historically, sh did trace the
command set +x, but ksh did not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ignoreeof setting prevents
accidental logouts when the end-of-file character (typically
&lt;control&gt;&acirc;D) is entered. A user shall explicitly
exit to leave the interactive shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The set &acirc;m option was
added to apply only to the UPE because it applies primarily
to interactive use, not shell script applications.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ability to do asynchronous
notification became available in the 1988 version of the
KornShell. To have it occur, the user had to issue the
command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">trap &quot;jobs &acirc;n&quot;
CLD</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The C shell provides two
different levels of an asynchronous notification capability.
The environment variable notify is analogous to what is done
in set &acirc;b or set &acirc;o notify. <br>
When set, it notifies the user immediately of background job
completions. When unset, this capability is turned off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The other notification ability
comes through the built-in utility notify. The syntax
is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">notify [%job ... ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By issuing notify with no
operands, it causes the C shell to notify the user
asynchronously when the state of the current job changes. If
given operands, notify asynchronously <br>
informs the user of changes in the states of the specified
jobs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To add asynchronous notification
to the POSIX shell, neither the KornShell extensions to
trap, nor the C shell notify environment variable seemed
appropriate (notify is not a <br>
proper POSIX environment variable name).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The set &acirc;b option was
selected as a compromise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The notify built-in was
considered to have more functionality than was required for
simple asynchronous notification.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Historically, some shells
applied the &acirc;u option to all parameters including $@
and $*. The standard developers felt that this was a
misfeature since it is normal and common for <br>
$@ and $* to be used in shell scripts regardless of whether
they were passed any arguments. Treating these uses as an
error when no arguments are passed reduces the value of
&acirc;u <br>
for its intended purpose of finding spelling mistakes in
variable names and uses of unset positional parameters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FUTURE DIRECTIONS <br>
None.</p>
