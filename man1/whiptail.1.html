--clear ] [ --default-item string ] [ --defaultno ] [ --fb ]
[ --nocancel ] [ --yes-button text ] [ --no-button text ] [

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
whiptail is a program that will let you present a variety of
questions or display messages using dialog boxes from a
shell script. Currently, these types of dialog boxes are
<br>
implemented:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">yes/no box, menu box, input box,
message box, text box, info box, checklist box, radiolist
box gauge box, and password box.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
--clear <br>
The screen will be cleared to the screen attribute on exit.
This doesn&rsquo;t work in an xterm (and descendants) if
alternate screen switching is enabled, because in that case
<br>
slang writes to (and clears) an alternate screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--defaultno <br>
The dialog box will open with the cursor over the No
button.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--default-item string <br>
Set the default item in a menu box. Normally the first item
in the box is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--fb, --fullbuttons <br>
Use full buttons. (By default, whiptail uses compact
buttons).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--nocancel <br>
The dialog box won&rsquo;t have a Cancel button.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--yes-button text <br>
Set the text of the Yes button.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-button text <br>
Set the text of the No button.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ok-button text <br>
Set the text of the Ok button.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--cancel-button text <br>
Set the text of the Cancel button.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--noitem <br>
The menu, checklist and radiolist widgets will display tags
only, not the item strings. The menu widget still needs some
items specified, but checklist and radiolist <br>
expect only tag and status.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--notags <br>
Don&rsquo;t display tags in the menu, checklist and
radiolist widgets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--separate-output <br>
For checklist widgets, output result one line at a time,
with no quoting. This facilitates parsing by another
program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--output-fd fd <br>
Direct output to the given file descriptor. Most whiptail
scripts write to standard error, but error messages may also
be written there, depending on your script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--title title <br>
Specifies a title string to be displayed at the top of the
dialog box.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--backtitle backtitle <br>
Specifies a backtitle string to be displayed on the
backdrop, at the top of the screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--scrolltext <br>
Force the display of a vertical scrollbar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--topleft <br>
Put window in top-left corner.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Print a help message and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --version <br>
Print version information and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Box Options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--yesno text height width <br>
A yes/no dialog box of size height rows by width columns
will be displayed. The string specified by text is displayed
inside the dialog box. If this string is too long to <br>
be fit in one line, it will be automatically divided into
multiple lines at appropriate places. The text string may
also contain the sub-string &quot;0 or newline characters
<br>
&lsquo;0 to control line breaking explicitly. This dialog
box is useful for asking questions that require the user to
answer either yes or no. The dialog box has a Yes but&acirc;
<br>
ton and a No button, in which the user can switch between by
pressing the TAB key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--msgbox text height width <br>
A message box is very similar to a yes/no box. The only
difference between a message box and a yes/no box is that a
message box has only a single OK button. You can use <br>
this dialog box to display any message you like. After
reading the message, the user can press the ENTER key so
that whiptail will exit and the calling shell script can
<br>
continue its operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--infobox text height width <br>
An info box is basically a message box. However, in this
case, whiptail will exit immediately after displaying the
message to the user. The screen is not cleared when <br>
whiptail exits, so that the message will remain on the
screen until the calling shell script clears it later. This
is useful when you want to inform the user that some <br>
operations are carrying on that may require some time to
finish.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--inputbox text height width
[init] <br>
An input box is useful when you want to ask questions that
require the user to input a string as the answer. If init is
supplied it is used to initialize the input string. <br>
When inputing the string, the BACKSPACE key can be used to
correct typing errors. If the input string is longer than
the width of the dialog box, the input field will be <br>
scrolled. On exit, the input string will be printed on
stderr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--passwordbox text height width
[init] <br>
A password box is similar to an input box, except the text
the user enters is not displayed. This is useful when
prompting for passwords or other sensitive information. Be
<br>
aware that if anything is passed in &quot;init&quot;, it
will be visible in the system&rsquo;s process table to
casual snoopers. Also, it is very confusing to the user to
provide them <br>
with a default password they cannot see. For these reasons,
using &quot;init&quot; is highly discouraged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--textbox file height width <br>
A text box lets you display the contents of a text file in a
dialog box. It is like a simple text file viewer. The user
can move through the file by using the UP/DOWN, <br>
PGUP/PGDN and HOME/END keys available on most keyboards. If
the lines are too long to be displayed in the box, the
LEFT/RIGHT keys can be used to scroll the text region <br>
horizontally. For more convenience, forward and backward
searching functions are also provided.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--menu text height width
menu-height [ tag item ] ... <br>
As its name suggests, a menu box is a dialog box that can be
used to present a list of choices in the form of a menu for
the user to choose. Each menu entry consists of a <br>
tag string and an item string. The tag gives the entry a
name to distinguish it from the other entries in the menu.
The item is a short description of the option that the <br>
entry represents. The user can move between the menu entries
by pressing the UP/DOWN keys, the first letter of the tag as
a hot-key. There are menu-height entries dis&acirc; <br>
played in the menu at one time, but the menu will be
scrolled if there are more entries than that. When whiptail
exits, the tag of the chosen menu entry will be printed on
<br>
stderr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--checklist text height width
list-height [ tag item status ] ... <br>
A checklist box is similar to a menu box in that there are
multiple entries presented in the form of a menu. You can
select and deselect items using the SPACE key. The <br>
initial on/off state of each entry is specified by status.
On exit, a list of the tag strings of those entries that are
turned on will be printed on stderr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--radiolist text height width
list-height [ tag item status ] ... <br>
A radiolist box is similar to a menu box. The only
difference is that you can indicate which entry is currently
selected, by setting its status to on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--gauge text height width
percent <br>
A gauge box displays a meter along the bottom of the box.
The meter indicates a percentage. New percentages are read
from standard input, one integer per line. The <br>
meter is updated to reflect each new percentage. If stdin is
XXX, the first following line is a percentage and subsequent
lines up to another XXX are used for a new <br>
prompt. The gauge exits when EOF is reached on stdin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
whiptail interprets arguments starting with a dash
&quot;-&quot; as being arguments. To avoid this, and start
some text in, for example, a menubox item, with a dash,
whiptail honours the <br>
getopt convention of accepting the special argument
&quot;--&quot; which means that all following arguments with
dashes are to be treated verbatim and not parsed as
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
Exit status is 0 if whiptail is exited by pressing the Yes
or OK button, and 1 if the No or Cancel button is pressed.
Otherwise, if errors occur inside whiptail or whiptail is
<br>
exited by pressing the ESC key, the exit status is -1.</p>
