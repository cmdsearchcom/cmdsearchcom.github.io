<p>pdsh(1) General Commands Manual pdsh(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pdcp - copy files to groups of hosts in parallel <br>
rpdcp - (reverse pdcp) copy files from a group of hosts in
parallel</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pdcp [options]... src [src2...] dest <br>
rpdcp [options]... src [src2...] dir</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
pdcp is a variant of the rcp(1) command. Unlike rcp(1),
which copies files to a single remote host, pdcp can copy
files to multiple remote hosts in parallel. However, pdcp
does <br>
not recognize files in the format
&lsquo;&lsquo;rname@rhost:path,&rsquo;&rsquo; therefore all
source files must be on the local host machine. Destination
nodes must be listed on the pdcp command line <br>
using a suitable target nodelist option (See the OPTIONS
section below). Each destination node listed must have pdcp
installed for the copy to succeed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When pdcp receives SIGINT
(ctrl-C), it lists the status of current threads. A second
SIGINT within one second terminates the program. Pending
threads may be canceled by issuing <br>
ctrl-Z within one second of ctrl-C. Pending threads are
those that have not yet been initiated, or are still in the
process of connecting to the remote host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Like pdsh(1), the functionality
of pdcp may be supplemented by dynamically loadable modules.
In pdcp, the modules may provide a new connect protocol
(replacing the standard <br>
rsh(1) protocol), filtering options (e.g. excluding hosts
that are down), and/or host selection options (e.g. -a
selects all nodes from a local config file). By default,
pdcp <br>
requires at least one &quot;rcmd&quot; module to be loaded
(to provide the channel for remote copy).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REVERSE PDCP <br>
rpdcp performs a reverse parallel copy. Rather than copying
files to remote hosts, files are retrieved from remote hosts
and stored locally. All directories or files retrieved <br>
will be stored with their remote hostname appended to the
filename. The destination file must be a directory when this
option is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In other respects, rpdcp is
exactly like pdcp, and further statements regarding pdcp in
this manual also apply to rpdcp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RCMD MODULES <br>
The method by which pdcp connects to remote hosts may be
selected at runtime using the -R option (See OPTIONS below).
This functionality is ultimately implemented via
dynami&acirc; <br>
cally loadable modules, and so the list of available options
may be different from installation to installation. A list
of currently available rcmd modules is printed when using
<br>
any of the -h, -V, or -L options. The default rcmd module
will also be displayed with the -h and -V options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A list of rcmd modules currently
distributed with pdcp follows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rsh Uses an internal,
thread-safe implementation of BSD rcmd(3) to run commands
using the standard rsh(1) protocol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ssh Uses a variant of popen(3)
to run multiple copies of the ssh(1) command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mrsh This module uses the
mrsh(1) protocol to execute jobs on remote hosts. The mrsh
protocol uses a credential based authentication, forgoing
the need to allocate reserved <br>
ports. In other aspects, it acts just like rsh.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">krb4 The krb4 module allows
users to execute remote commands after authenticating with
kerberos. Of course, the remote rshd daemons must be
kerberized.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xcpu The xcpu module uses the
xcpu service to execute remote commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The list of available pdcp options is determined at runtime
by supplementing the list of standard pdcp options with any
options provided by loaded rcmd and misc modules. In some
<br>
cases, options provided by modules may conflict with each
other. In these cases, the modules are incompatible and the
first module loaded wins.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Standard target nodelist options
<br>
-w TARGETS,... <br>
Target and or filter the specified list of hosts. Do not use
with any other node selection options (e.g. -a, -g, if they
are available). No spaces are allowed in the <br>
comma-separated list. Arguments in the TARGETS list may
include normal host names, a range of hosts in hostlist
format (See HOSTLIST EXPRESSIONS), or a single
&lsquo;-&rsquo; charac&acirc; <br>
ter to read the list of hosts on stdin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a host or hostlist is
preceded by a &lsquo;-&rsquo; character, this causes those
hosts to be explicitly excluded. If the argument is preceded
by a single &lsquo;^&rsquo; character, it is taken <br>
to be the path to file containing a list of hosts, one per
line. If the item begins with a &lsquo;/&rsquo; character,
it is taken as a regular expression on which to filter the
list <br>
of hosts (a regex argument may also be optionally trailed by
another &rsquo;/&rsquo;, e.g. /node.*/). A regex or file
name argument may also be preceeded by a minus
&lsquo;-&rsquo; to exclude <br>
instead of include thoses hosts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A list of hosts may also be
preceded by &quot;user@&quot; to specify a remote username
other than the default, or &quot;rcmd_type:&quot; to specify
an alternate rcmd connection type for these <br>
hosts. When used together, the rcmd type must be specified
first, e.g. &quot;ssh:user1@host0&quot; would use ssh to
connect to host0 as user &quot;user1.&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x host,host,... <br>
Exclude the specified hosts. May be specified in conjunction
with other target node list options such as -a and -g (when
available). Hostlists may also be specified to the <br>
-x option (see the HOSTLIST EXPRESSIONS section below).
Arguments to -x may also be preceeded by the filename
(&lsquo;^&rsquo;) and regex (&rsquo;/&rsquo;) characters as
described above, in which <br>
case the resulting hosts are excluded as if they had been
given to -w and preceeded with the minus &lsquo;-&rsquo;
character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Standard pdcp options <br>
-h Output usage menu and quit. A list of available rcmd
modules will be printed at the end of the usage message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q List option values and the
target nodelist and exit without action.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b Disable ctrl-C status feature
so that a single ctrl-C kills parallel copy. (Batch
Mode)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Copy directories
recursively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p Preserve modification time
and modes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e PATH <br>
Explicitly specify path to remote pdcp binary instead of
using the locally executed path. Can also be set via the
environment variable PDSH_REMOTE_PDCP_PATH.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l user <br>
This option may be used to copy files as another user,
subject to authorization. For BSD rcmd, this means the
invoking user and system must be listed in the
user&Acirc;&acute;s .rhosts <br>
file (even for root).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t seconds <br>
Set the connect timeout. Default is 10 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f number <br>
Set the maximum number of simultaneous remote copies to
number. The default is 32.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R name <br>
Set rcmd module to name. This option may also be set via the
PDSH_RCMD_TYPE environment variable. A list of available
rcmd modules may be obtained via either the -h or -L <br>
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M name,... <br>
When multiple misc modules provide the same options to pdsh,
the first module initialized &quot;wins&quot; and subsequent
modules are not loaded. The -M option allows a list of <br>
modules to be specified that will be force-initialized
before all others, in-effect ensuring that they load without
conflict (unless they conflict with eachother). This <br>
option may also be set via the PDSH_MISC_MODULES environment
variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L List info on all loaded pdcp
modules and quit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Include more complete thread
status when SIGINT is received, and display connect and
command time statistics on stderr when done.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Output pdcp version
information, along with list of currently loaded modules,
and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOSTLIST EXPRESSIONS <br>
As noted in sections above, pdcp accepts ranges of hostnames
in the general form: prefix[n-m,l-k,...], where n &lt; m and
l &lt; k, etc., as an alternative to explicit lists of
hosts. <br>
This form should not be confused with regular expression
character classes (also denoted by
&lsquo;&lsquo;[]&rsquo;&rsquo;). For example, foo[19] does
not represent foo1 or foo9, but rather represents a <br>
degenerate range: foo19.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This range syntax is meant only
as a convenience on clusters with a prefixNN naming
convention and specification of ranges should not be
considered necessary -- the list <br>
foo1,foo9 could be specified as such, or by the range
foo[1,9].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some examples of range usage
follow:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Copy /etc/hosts to
foo01,foo02,...,foo05 <br>
pdcp -w foo[01-05] /etc/hosts /etc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Copy /etc/hosts to
foo7,foo9,foo10 <br>
pdcp -w foo[7,9-10] /etc/hosts /etc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Copy /etc/hosts to
foo0,foo4,foo5 <br>
pdcp -w foo[0-5] -x foo[1-3] /etc/hosts /etc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As a reminder to the reader,
some shells will interpret brackets (&rsquo;[&rsquo; and
&rsquo;]&rsquo;) for pattern matching. Depending on your
shell, it may be necessary to enclose ranged lists within
<br>
quotes. For example, in tcsh, the first example above should
be executed as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pdcp -w &quot;foo[01-05]&quot;
/etc/hosts /etc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ORIGIN <br>
Pdsh/pdcp was originally a rewrite of IBM dsh(1) by Jim
Garlick &lt;garlick@llnl.gov&gt; on LLNL&rsquo;s ASCI
Blue-Pacific IBM SP system. It is now also used on Linux
clusters at LLNL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LIMITATIONS <br>
When using ssh for remote execution, stderr of ssh to be
folded in with that of the remote command. When invoked by
pdcp, it is not possible for ssh to prompt for confirmation
<br>
if a host key changes, prompt for passwords if RSA keys are
not configured properly, etc.. Finally, the connect timeout
is only adjustable with ssh when the underlying ssh <br>
implementation supports it, and pdsh has been built to use
the correct option.</p>
