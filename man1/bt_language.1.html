<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
One of the problems with BibTeX is that there is no formal
specification of the language. This means that users
exploring the arcane corners of the language are largely on
their <br>
own, and programmers implementing their own parsers are
completely on their own---except for observing the behaviour
of the original implementation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other parser implementors
(Nelson Beebe of &quot;bibclean&quot; fame, in particular)
have taken the trouble to explain the language accepted by
their parser, and in that spirit the <br>
following is presented.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are unfamiliar with the
arcana of regular and context-free languages, you will not
have any easy time understanding this. This is not an
introduction to the BibTeX <br>
language; any LaTeX book would be more suitable for learning
the data language itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LEXICAL GRAMMAR <br>
The lexical scanner has three distinct modes: top-level,
in-entry, and string. Roughly speaking, top-level is the
initial mode; we enter in-entry mode on seeing an
&quot;@&quot; at top- <br>
level; and on seeing the &quot;}&quot; or &quot;)&quot; that
ends the entry, we return to top-level. We enter string mode
on seeing a &quot;&quot;&quot; or non-entry-delimiting
&quot;{&quot; from in-entry mode. Note that <br>
the lexical language is both non-regular (because braces
must balance) and context-sensitive (because &quot;{&quot;
can mean different things depending on its syntactic
context). That <br>
said, we will use regular expressions to describe the
lexical elements, because they are the starting point used
by the lexical scanner itself. The rest of the lexical
grammar <br>
will be informally explained in the text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">From top-level, the following
tokens are recognized according to the regular expressions
on the right:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AT @ <br>
NEWLINE <br>
COMMENT ~[0*]+ <br>
WHITESPACE [&nbsp; ]+ <br>
JUNK ~[@</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(Note that this is PCCTS regular
expression syntax, which should be fairly familar to users
of other regex engines. One oddity is that a character class
is negated as &quot;~[...]&quot; <br>
rather than &quot;[^...]&quot;.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On seeing &quot;at&quot; at
top-level, we enter in-entry mode. Whitespace, junk,
newlines, and comments are all skipped, with the latter two
incrementing a line counter. (Junk is <br>
explicitly recognized to allow for
&quot;bibtex&quot;&rsquo;s &quot;implicit comment&quot;
scheme.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">From in-entry mode, we recognize
newline, comment, and whitespace identically to top-level
mode. In addition, the following tokens are recognized:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NUMBER [0-9]+ <br>
NAME [a-z0-9+&minus;.;&lt;&gt; LBRACE <br>
RBRACE <br>
LPAREN <br>
RPAREN <br>
EQUALS = <br>
HASH COMMA , <br>
QUOTE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At this point, the lexical
scanner starts to sound suspiciously like a context-free
grammar, rather than a collection of independent regular
expressions. However, it is <br>
necessary to keep this complexity in the scanner because
certain characters (&quot;{&quot; and &quot;(&quot; in
particular) have very different lexical meanings depending
on the tokens that have <br>
preceded them in the input stream.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In particular, &quot;{&quot; and
&quot;(&quot; are treated as &quot;entry openers&quot; if
they follow one &quot;at&quot; and one &quot;name&quot;
token, unless the value of the &quot;name&quot; token is
&quot;comment&quot;. (Note the switch from <br>
top-level to in-entry between the two tokens.) In the
@comment case, the delimiter is considered as starting a
string, and we enter string mode. Otherwise, the delimiter
is <br>
saved, and when we see a corresponding &quot;}&quot; or
&quot;)&quot; it is considered an &quot;entry closer&quot;.
(Braces are balanced for free here because the string lexer
takes care of counting brace- <br>
depth.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Anywhere else, &quot;{&quot; is
considered as starting a string, and we enter string mode.
&quot;&quot;&quot; always starts a string, regardless of
context. The other tokens (&quot;name&quot;,
&quot;number&quot;, <br>
&quot;equals&quot;, &quot;hash&quot;, and &quot;comma&quot;)
are recognized unconditionally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that &quot;name&quot; is a
catch-all token used for entry types, citation keys, field
names, and macro names; because BibTeX has slightly
different (largely undocumented) rules for <br>
these various elements, a bit of trickery is needed to make
things work. As a starting point, consider BibTeX&rsquo;s
definition of what&rsquo;s allowed for an entry key: a
sequence of any <br>
characters except</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot; # % &rsquo; ( ) , = {
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">plus space. There are a couple
of problems with this scheme. First, without specifying the
character set from which those &quot;magic 10&quot;
characters are drawn, it&rsquo;s a bit hard to <br>
know just what is allowed. Second, allowing &quot;@&quot;
characters could lead to confusing BibTeX syntax (it
doesn&rsquo;t confuse BibTeX, but it might confuse a human
reader). Finally, <br>
allowing certain characters that are special to TeX means
that BibTeX can generate bogus TeX code: try putting a
backslash (&quot; <br>
exception is rather specific to the &quot;generating (La)TeX
code from a BibTeX database&quot; application, but since
that&rsquo;s the major application for BibTeX databases,
then it will <br>
presumably be the major application for btparse, at least
initially. Thus, it makes sense to pay attention to this
problem.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In btparse, then, a name is
defined as any sequence of letters, digits, underscores, and
the following characters:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">! $ &amp; * + - . / : ; &lt;
&gt; ? [ ] ^ _ &lsquo; |</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This list was derived by
removing BibTeX&rsquo;s &quot;magic 10&quot; from the set of
printable 7-bit ASCII characters (32-126), and then further
removing &quot;@&quot;, &quot; <br>
btparse disallows some of the weirder entry keys that BibTeX
would accept, such as &quot;o@bar&quot;, but still allows a
string with initial digits. In fact, from the above
definition <br>
it appears that btparse would accept a string of all digits
as a &quot;name;&quot; this is not the case, though, as the
lexical scanner recognizes such a digit string as a number
first. <br>
There are two problems here: BibTeX entry keys may in fact
be entirely numeric, and field names may not begin with a
digit. (Those are two of the not-so-obvious differences in
<br>
BibTeX&rsquo;s handling of keys and field names.) The tricks
used to deal with these problems are implemented in the
parser rather than the lexical scanner, so are described in
<br>
&quot;SYNTACTIC GRAMMAR&quot; below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The string lexer recognizes
&quot;lbrace&quot;, &quot;rbrace&quot;, &quot;lparen&quot;,
and &quot;rparen&quot; tokens in order to count brace- or
parenthesis-depth. This is necessary so it knows when to
accept a <br>
string delimited by braces or parentheses. (Note that a
parenthesis-delimited string is only allowed after
@comment---this is not a normal BibTeX construct.) In
addition, it <br>
converts each non-space whitespace character (newline,
carriage-return, and tab) to a single space. (Sequences of
whitespace are not collapsed; that&rsquo;s the domain of
string post- <br>
processing, which is well removed from the scanner or
parser.) Finally, it accepts &quot;&quot;&quot; to delimit
quote-delimited strings. Apart from those restrictions, the
string lexer <br>
accepts anything up to the end-of-string delimiter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNTACTIC GRAMMAR <br>
(The language used to describe the grammar here is the
extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF) used by PCCTS. Terminals
are represented by uppercase strings, non-terminals by
lowercase <br>
strings; terminal names are the same as those given in the
lexical grammar above. &quot;( foo )*&quot; means zero or
more repetitions of the &quot;foo&quot; production, and
&quot;{ foo }&quot; means an <br>
optional &quot;foo&quot;.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A file is just a sequence of
zero or more entries:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bibfile : ( entry )*</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An entry is an at-sign, a name
(the &quot;entry type&quot;), and the entry body:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">entry : AT NAME body</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A body is either a string (this
alternative is only tried if the entry type is
&quot;comment&quot;) or the entry contents:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">body : STRING # for comment
entries <br>
| ENTRY_OPEN contents ENTRY_CLOSE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(&quot;ENTRY_OPEN&quot; and
&quot;ENTRY_CLOSE&quot; are either &quot;{&quot; and
&quot;}&quot; or &quot;(&quot; and &quot;)&quot;, depending
what is seen in the input for a particular entry.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are three possible
productions for the &quot;contents&quot; non-terminal. Only
one applies to any given entry, depending on the entry
metatype (which in turn depends on the entry <br>
type). Currently, btparse supports four entry metatypes:
comment, preamble, macro definition, and regular. The first
two correspond to @comment and @preamble entries;
&quot;macro <br>
definition&quot; is for @string entries; and
&quot;regular&quot; is for all other entry types. (The
library will be extended to handle @modify and @alias entry
types, and corresponding <br>
&quot;modify&quot; and &quot;alias&quot; metatypes, when
BibTeX 1.0 is released and the exact syntax is known.) The
&quot;metatype&quot; concept is necessary so that all entry
types that aren&rsquo;t specifically <br>
recognized fall into the &quot;regular&quot; metatype.
It&rsquo;s also convenient not to have to &quot;strcmp&quot;
the entry type all the time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">contents : ( NAME | NUMBER )
COMMA fields # for regular entries <br>
| fields # for macro definition entries <br>
| value # for preamble entries</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the entry key is not
just a &quot;NAME&quot;, but &quot;( NAME | NUMBER)&quot;.
This is necessary because BibTeX allows all-numeric entry
keys, but btparse&rsquo;s lexical scanner recognizes <br>
such digit strings as &quot;NUMBER&quot; tokens.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;fields&quot; is a
comma-separated list of fields, with an optional single
trailing comma:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fields : field { COMMA fields }
<br>
|</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A &quot;field&quot; is a single
&quot;field = value&quot; assignment:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">field : NAME EQUALS value</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that &quot;NAME&quot; here
is a restricted version of the &quot;name&quot; token
described in &quot;LEXICAL GRAMMAR&quot; above. Any
&quot;name&quot; token will be accepted by the parser, but
it is immediately <br>
checked to ensure that it doesn&rsquo;t begin with a digit;
if so, an artificial syntax error is triggered. (This is for
compatibility with BibTeX, which doesn&rsquo;t allow field
names to <br>
start with a digit.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A &quot;value&quot; is a series
of simple values joined by &rsquo;#&rsquo; characters:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">value : simple_value ( HASH
simple_value )*</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A simple value is a string,
number, or name (for macro invocations):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">simple_value : STRING <br>
| NUMBER <br>
| NAME</p>
