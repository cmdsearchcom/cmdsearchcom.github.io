One of the problems with BibTeX is that there is no formal specification of the
  language. This means that users exploring the arcane corners of the language
  are largely on their own, and programmers implementing their own parsers are
  completely on their own---except for observing the behaviour of the original
  implementation.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Other parser implementors (Nelson Beebe of &quot;bibclean&quot; fame, in
  particular) have taken the trouble to explain the language accepted by their
  parser, and in that spirit the following is presented.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you are unfamiliar with the arcana of regular and context-free languages, you
  will not have any easy time understanding this. This is <i>not</i> an
  introduction to the BibTeX language; any LaTeX book would be more suitable for
  learning the data language itself.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="LEXICAL_GRAMMAR"><a class="selflink" href="#LEXICAL_GRAMMAR">LEXICAL
  GRAMMAR</a></h1>
The lexical scanner has three distinct modes: top-level, in-entry, and string.
  Roughly speaking, top-level is the initial mode; we enter in-entry mode on
  seeing an &quot;@&quot; at top-level; and on seeing the &quot;}&quot; or
  &quot;)&quot; that ends the entry, we return to top-level. We enter string
  mode on seeing a &quot;&quot;&quot; or non-entry-delimiting &quot;{&quot; from
  in-entry mode. Note that the lexical language is both non-regular (because
  braces must balance) and context-sensitive (because &quot;{&quot; can mean
  different things depending on its syntactic context). That said, we will use
  regular expressions to describe the lexical elements, because they are the
  starting point used by the lexical scanner itself. The rest of the lexical
  grammar will be informally explained in the text.
<div class="Pp"></div>
From top-level, the following tokens are recognized according to the regular
  expressions on the right:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   AT                    \@
   NEWLINE               \n
   COMMENT               \%~[\n]*\n
   WHITESPACE            [\ \r\t]+
   JUNK                  ~[\@\n\ \r\t]+
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
(Note that this is PCCTS regular expression syntax, which should be fairly
  familar to users of other regex engines. One oddity is that a character class
  is negated as &quot;~[...]&quot; rather than &quot;[^...]&quot;.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
On seeing &quot;at&quot; at top-level, we enter in-entry mode. Whitespace, junk,
  newlines, and comments are all skipped, with the latter two incrementing a
  line counter. (Junk is explicitly recognized to allow for &quot;bibtex&quot;'s
  &quot;implicit comment&quot; scheme.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
From in-entry mode, we recognize newline, comment, and whitespace identically to
  top-level mode. In addition, the following tokens are recognized:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   NUMBER                [0-9]+
   NAME                  [a-z0-9\!\$\&amp;\*\+\-\.\/\:\;\&lt;\&gt;\?\[\]\^\_\`\|]+
   LBRACE                \{
   RBRACE                \}
   LPAREN                \(
   RPAREN                \)
   EQUALS                =
   HASH                  \#
   COMMA                 ,
   QUOTE                 \&quot;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
At this point, the lexical scanner starts to sound suspiciously like a
  context-free grammar, rather than a collection of independent regular
  expressions. However, it is necessary to keep this complexity in the scanner
  because certain characters (&quot;{&quot; and &quot;(&quot; in particular)
  have very different lexical meanings depending on the tokens that have
  preceded them in the input stream.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In particular, &quot;{&quot; and &quot;(&quot; are treated as &quot;entry
  openers&quot; if they follow one &quot;at&quot; and one &quot;name&quot;
  token, unless the value of the &quot;name&quot; token is &quot;comment&quot;.
  (Note the switch from top-level to in-entry between the two tokens.) In the
  @comment case, the delimiter is considered as starting a string, and we enter
  string mode. Otherwise, the delimiter is saved, and when we see a
  corresponding &quot;}&quot; or &quot;)&quot; it is considered an &quot;entry
  closer&quot;. (Braces are balanced for free here because the string lexer
  takes care of counting brace-depth.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
Anywhere else, &quot;{&quot; is considered as starting a string, and we enter
  string mode. &quot;&quot;&quot; always starts a string, regardless of context.
  The other tokens (&quot;name&quot;, &quot;number&quot;, &quot;equals&quot;,
  &quot;hash&quot;, and &quot;comma&quot;) are recognized unconditionally.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that &quot;name&quot; is a catch-all token used for entry types, citation
  keys, field names, and macro names; because BibTeX has slightly different
  (largely undocumented) rules for these various elements, a bit of trickery is
  needed to make things work. As a starting point, consider BibTeX's definition
  of what's allowed for an entry key: a sequence of any characters <i>except</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   &quot; # % ' ( ) , = { }
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
plus space. There are a couple of problems with this scheme. First, without
  specifying the character set from which those &quot;magic 10&quot; characters
  are drawn, it's a bit hard to know just what is allowed. Second, allowing
  &quot;@&quot; characters could lead to confusing BibTeX syntax (it doesn't
  confuse BibTeX, but it might confuse a human reader). Finally, allowing
  certain characters that are special to TeX means that BibTeX can generate
  bogus TeX code: try putting a backslash (&quot;\&quot;) or tilde
  (&quot;~&quot;) in a citation key. (This last exception is rather specific to
  the &quot;generating (La)TeX code from a BibTeX database&quot; application,
  but since that's the major application for BibTeX databases, then it will
  presumably be the major application for <b>btparse</b>, at least initially.
  Thus, it makes sense to pay attention to this problem.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
In <b>btparse</b>, then, a name is defined as any sequence of letters, digits,
  underscores, and the following characters:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   ! $ &amp; * + - . / : ; &lt; &gt; ? [ ] ^ _ ` |
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This list was derived by removing BibTeX's &quot;magic 10&quot; from the set of
  printable 7-bit ASCII characters (32-126), and then further removing
  &quot;@&quot;, &quot;\&quot;, and &quot;~&quot;. This means that
  <b>btparse</b> disallows some of the weirder entry keys that BibTeX would
  accept, such as &quot;\foo@bar&quot;, but still allows a string with initial
  digits. In fact, from the above definition it appears that <b>btparse</b>
  would accept a string of all digits as a &quot;name;&quot; this is not the
  case, though, as the lexical scanner recognizes such a digit string as a
  number first. There are two problems here: BibTeX entry keys may in fact be
  entirely numeric, and field names may not begin with a digit. (Those are two
  of the not-so-obvious differences in BibTeX's handling of keys and field
  names.) The tricks used to deal with these problems are implemented in the
  parser rather than the lexical scanner, so are described in &quot;SYNTACTIC
  GRAMMAR&quot; below.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The string lexer recognizes &quot;lbrace&quot;, &quot;rbrace&quot;,
  &quot;lparen&quot;, and &quot;rparen&quot; tokens in order to count brace- or
  parenthesis-depth. This is necessary so it knows when to accept a string
  delimited by braces or parentheses. (Note that a parenthesis-delimited string
  is only allowed after @comment---this is not a normal BibTeX construct.) In
  addition, it converts each non-space whitespace character (newline,
  carriage-return, and tab) to a single space. (Sequences of whitespace are not
  collapsed; that's the domain of string post-processing, which is well removed
  from the scanner or parser.) Finally, it accepts &quot;&quot;&quot; to delimit
  quote-delimited strings. Apart from those restrictions, the string lexer
  accepts anything up to the end-of-string delimiter.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNTACTIC_GRAMMAR"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNTACTIC_GRAMMAR">SYNTACTIC
  GRAMMAR</a></h1>
(The language used to describe the grammar here is the extended Backus-Naur Form
  (EBNF) used by PCCTS. Terminals are represented by uppercase strings,
  non-terminals by lowercase strings; terminal names are the same as those given
  in the lexical grammar above. &quot;( foo )*&quot; means zero or more
  repetitions of the &quot;foo&quot; production, and &quot;{ foo }&quot; means
  an optional &quot;foo&quot;.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
A file is just a sequence of zero or more entries:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   bibfile : ( entry )*
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
An entry is an at-sign, a name (the &quot;entry type&quot;), and the entry body:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   entry : AT NAME body
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
A body is either a string (this alternative is only tried if the entry type is
  &quot;comment&quot;) or the entry contents:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   body : STRING                    # for comment entries
        | ENTRY_OPEN contents ENTRY_CLOSE
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
(&quot;ENTRY_OPEN&quot; and &quot;ENTRY_CLOSE&quot; are either &quot;{&quot; and
  &quot;}&quot; or &quot;(&quot; and &quot;)&quot;, depending what is seen in
  the input for a particular entry.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
There are three possible productions for the &quot;contents&quot; non-terminal.
  Only one applies to any given entry, depending on the entry metatype (which in
  turn depends on the entry type). Currently, <b>btparse</b> supports four entry
  metatypes: comment, preamble, macro definition, and regular. The first two
  correspond to @comment and @preamble entries; &quot;macro definition&quot; is
  for @string entries; and &quot;regular&quot; is for all other entry types.
  (The library will be extended to handle @modify and @alias entry types, and
  corresponding &quot;modify&quot; and &quot;alias&quot; metatypes, when BibTeX
  1.0 is released and the exact syntax is known.) The &quot;metatype&quot;
  concept is necessary so that all entry types that aren't specifically
  recognized fall into the &quot;regular&quot; metatype. It's also convenient
  not to have to &quot;strcmp&quot; the entry type all the time.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   contents : ( NAME | NUMBER ) COMMA fields     # for regular entries
            | fields                # for macro definition entries
            | value                 # for preamble entries
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that the entry key is not just a &quot;NAME&quot;, but &quot;( NAME |
  NUMBER)&quot;. This is necessary because BibTeX allows all-numeric entry keys,
  but <b>btparse</b>'s lexical scanner recognizes such digit strings as
  &quot;NUMBER&quot; tokens.
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;fields&quot; is a comma-separated list of fields, with an optional single
  trailing comma:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   fields : field { COMMA fields }
          |
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
A &quot;field&quot; is a single &quot;field = value&quot; assignment:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   field : NAME EQUALS value
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that &quot;NAME&quot; here is a restricted version of the &quot;name&quot;
  token described in &quot;LEXICAL GRAMMAR&quot; above. Any &quot;name&quot;
  token will be accepted by the parser, but it is immediately checked to ensure
  that it doesn't begin with a digit; if so, an artificial syntax error is
  triggered. (This is for compatibility with BibTeX, which doesn't allow field
  names to start with a digit.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
A &quot;value&quot; is a series of simple values joined by '#' characters:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   value : simple_value ( HASH simple_value )*
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
A simple value is a string, number, or name (for macro invocations):
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   simple_value : STRING
                | NUMBER
                | NAME
</pre>
