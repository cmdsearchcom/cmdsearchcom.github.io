  QUESTIONS</a></h1>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Q:_2.1____What_is_PDL_?"><a class="selflink" href="#Q:_2.1____What_is_PDL_?">Q:
  2.1 What is PDL ?</a></h2>
PDL stands for <i>Perl Data Language</i> . To say it with the words of Karl
  Glazebrook, initiator of the PDL project:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    The PDL concept is to give standard perl5 the ability
    to COMPACTLY store and SPEEDILY manipulate the large
    N-dimensional data sets which are the bread and butter
    of scientific computing. e.g. $a=$b+$c can add two
    2048x2048 images in only a fraction of a second.
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
It provides tons of useful functionality for scientific and numeric analysis.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For readers familiar with other scientific data evaluation packages it may be
  helpful to add that PDL is in many respects similar to IDL, MATLAB and similar
  packages. However, it tries to improve on a number of issues which were
  perceived (by the authors of PDL) as shortcomings of those existing packages.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Q:_2.2____Who_supports_PDL?_Who_develops_it?"><a class="selflink" href="#Q:_2.2____Who_supports_PDL?_Who_develops_it?">Q:
  2.2 Who supports PDL? Who develops it?</a></h2>
PDL is supported by its users. General informal support for PDL is provided
  through the PDL mailing list (pdl-general@lists.sourceforge.net , see below).
<div class="Pp"></div>
As a Perl extension (see Q: 2.5 below) it is devoted to the idea of free and
  open development put forth by the Perl community. PDL was and is being
  actively developed by a loosely knit group of people around the world who
  coordinate their activities through the PDL development mailing list
  (pdl-devel@lists.sourceforge.net , see Q: 3.2 below). If you would like to
  join in the ongoing efforts to improve PDL please join this list.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Q:_2.3____Why_yet_another_Data_Language_?"><a class="selflink" href="#Q:_2.3____Why_yet_another_Data_Language_?">Q:
  2.3 Why yet another Data Language ?</a></h2>
There are actually several reasons and everyone should decide for himself which
  are the most important ones:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">PDL is &quot;free software&quot;. The authors of PDL think
      that this concept has several advantages: everyone has access to the
      sources -&gt; better debugging, easily adaptable to your own needs,
      extensible for your purposes, etc... In comparison with commercial
      packages such as MATLAB and IDL this is of considerable importance for
      workers who want to do some work at home and cannot afford the
      considerable cost to buy commercial packages for personal use.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">PDL is based on a powerful and well designed scripting
      language: Perl. In contrast to other scientific/numeric data analysis
      languages it has been designed using the features of a proven language
      instead of having grown into existence from scratch. Defining the control
      structures while features were added during development leads to languages
      that often appear clumsy and badly planned for most existing packages with
      similar scope as PDL.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Using Perl as the basis a PDL programmer has all the
      powerful features of Perl at his hand, right from the start. This includes
      regular expressions, associative arrays (hashes), well designed interfaces
      to the operating system, network, etc. Experience has shown that even in
      mainly numerically oriented programming it is often extremely handy if you
      have easy access to powerful semi-numerical or completely non-numerical
      functionality as well. For example, you might want to offer the results of
      a complicated computation as a server process to other processes on the
      network, perhaps directly accepting input from other processes on the
      network. Using Perl and existing Perl extension packages things like this
      are no problem at all (and it all will fit into your &quot;PDL
      script&quot;).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Extremely easy extensibility and interoperability as PDL is
      a Perl extension; development support for Perl extensions is an integral
      part of Perl and there are already numerous extensions to standard Perl
      freely available on the network.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Integral language features of Perl (regular expressions,
      hashes, object modules) immensely facilitated development and
      implementation of key concepts of PDL. One of the most striking examples
      for this point is probably PDL::PP (see Q: 6.16 below), a code
      generator/parser/pre-processor that generates PDL functions from concise
      descriptions.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>

  2.4 What is PDL good for ?</a></h2>
Just in case you do not yet know what the main features of PDL are and what one
  could do with them, here is a (necessarily selective) list of key features:
<div class="Pp"></div>
PDL is well suited for matrix computations, general handling of multidimensional
  data, image processing, general scientific computation, numerical
  applications. It supports I/O for many popular image and data formats, 1D
  (line plots), 2D (images) and 3D (volume visualization, surface plots via
  OpenGL - for instance implemented using Mesa or video card OpenGL drivers),
  graphics display capabilities and implements many numerical and semi-numerical
  algorithms.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Through the powerful pre-processor it is also easy to interface Perl to your
  favorite C routines, more of that further below.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Q:_2.5____What_is_the_connection_between_PDL_and_Perl_?"><a class="selflink" href="#Q:_2.5____What_is_the_connection_between_PDL_and_Perl_?">Q:
  2.5 What is the connection between PDL and Perl ?</a></h2>
PDL is a Perl5 extension package. As such it needs an existing Perl5
  installation (see below) to run. Furthermore, much of PDL is written in Perl
  (+ some core functionality that is written in C). PDL programs are
  (syntactically) just Perl scripts that happen to use some of the functionality
  implemented by the package &quot;PDL&quot;.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Q:_2.6____What_do_I_need_to_run_PDL_on_my_machine_?"><a class="selflink" href="#Q:_2.6____What_do_I_need_to_run_PDL_on_my_machine_?">Q:
  2.6 What do I need to run PDL on my machine ?</a></h2>
Since PDL is just a Perl5 package you need first of all an installation of Perl5
  on your machine. As of this writing PDL requires version 5.10.x of perl, or
  higher. More information on where and how to get a Perl installation can be
  found at the Perl home page &lt;http://www.perl.org&gt; and at many CPAN sites
  (if you do not know what <i>CPAN</i> is, check the answer to the next
  question).
<div class="Pp"></div>
To build PDL you also need a working C compiler, support for Xsubs, and the
  package Extutils::MakeMaker. If you don't have a compiler there might be a
  binary distribution available, see &quot;Binary distributions&quot; below.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you can (or cannot) get PDL working on a new (previously unsupported)
  platform we would like to hear about it. Please, report your success/failure
  to the PDL mailing list at pdl-general@lists.sourceforge.net . We will do our
  best to assist you in porting PDL to a new system.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Q:_2.7____Where_do_I_get_it?"><a class="selflink" href="#Q:_2.7____Where_do_I_get_it?">Q:
  2.7 Where do I get it?</a></h2>
PDL is available as source distribution in the <i>Comprehensive Perl Archive
  Network</i> (or CPAN) and from the sourceforge.net project page at
  &lt;https://sourceforge.net/projects/pdl/files/&gt;. The CPAN archives
  contains not only the PDL distribution but also just about everything else
  that is Perl-related. CPAN is mirrored by dozens of sites all over the world.
  The main site is &lt;http://www.cpan.org&gt;, and local CPAN sites (mirrors)
  can be found there. Within CPAN you find the latest released version of PDL in
  the directory /modules/by-module/PDL/. PDL's homepage is at
  &lt;http://pdl.perl.org&gt; and the latest version can also be downloaded from
  there.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Q:_2.8____What_do_I_have_to_pay_to_get_PDL?"><a class="selflink" href="#Q:_2.8____What_do_I_have_to_pay_to_get_PDL?">Q:
  2.8 What do I have to pay to get PDL?</a></h2>
We are delighted to be able to give you the nicest possible answer on a question
  like this: PDL is *free software* and all sources are publicly available. But
  still, there are some copyrights to comply with. So please, try to be as nice
  as we (the PDL authors) are and try to comply with them.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Oh, before you think it is *completely* free: you have to invest some time to
  pull the distribution from the net, compile and install it and (maybe) read
  the manuals.

  3.1 Where can I get information on PDL?</a></h2>
The complete PDL documentation is available with the PDL distribution. Use the
  command &quot;perldoc PDL&quot; to start learning about PDL.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The easiest way by far, however, to get familiar with PDL is to use the PDL
  on-line help facility from within the PDL shell, &quot;pdl2&quot; Just type
  &quot;pdl2&quot; at your system prompt. Once you are inside the
  &quot;pdl2&quot; shell type &quot;help&quot; . Using the &quot;help&quot; and
  &quot;apropos&quot; commands inside the shell you should be able to find the
  way round the documentation.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Even better, you can immediately try your newly acquired knowledge about PDL by
  issuing PDL/Perl commands directly at the command line. To illustrate this
  process, here is the record of a typical &quot;pdl2&quot; session of a PDL
  beginner (lengthy output is only symbolically reproduced in braces ( &lt;...
  ...&gt; ) ):
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    unix&gt; pdl2
    pdl&gt; help
    &lt; ... help output ... &gt;
    pdl&gt; help PDL::QuickStart
    &lt; ... perldoc page ... &gt;
    pdl&gt; $a = pdl (1,5,7.3,1.0)
    pdl&gt; $b = sequence float, 4, 4
    pdl&gt; help inner
    &lt; ... help on the 'inner' function ... &gt;
    pdl&gt; $c = inner $a, $b
    pdl&gt; p $c
    [22.6 79.8 137 194.2]
</pre>

  3.3 What is the current version of PDL ?</a></h2>
As of this writing (FAQ version 1.008 of 21 May 2017) the latest stable version
  is 2.018. The latest stable version should always be available from a CPAN
  mirror site near you (see Question 2.7 for info on where to get PDL).
<div class="Pp"></div>
The most current (possibly unstable) version of PDL can be obtained from the Git
  repository, see Question 4.10 and periodic CPAN developers releases of the Git
  code will be made for testing purposes and more general availability.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Q:_3.4__How_can_PDL-2.2_be_older_than_PDL-2.007?"><a class="selflink" href="#Q:_3.4__How_can_PDL-2.2_be_older_than_PDL-2.007?">Q:
  3.4 How can PDL-2.2 be older than PDL-2.007?</a></h2>
Over its development, PDL has used both a single floating point version number
  (from the versions 1.x through 2.005) at which point it switched to a dotted
  triple version for 2.1.1 onward---EXCEPT for version 2.2 which came out which
  should have been 2.2.0. To simplify and unify things, PDL has reverted to a
  single float version representation with PDL-2.006. This can cause dependency
  problems for modules that set a minimum PDL version of 2.2. The work around
  it, note that all extant PDL releases have version numbers greater than 2.2.1
  so that using 0 as the minimum version will work.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Q:_3.5____I_want_to_contribute_to_the_further_development_of_PDL._How_can_I_help?"><a class="selflink" href="#Q:_3.5____I_want_to_contribute_to_the_further_development_of_PDL._How_can_I_help?">Q:
  3.5 I want to contribute to the further development of PDL. How can I
  help?</a></h2>
Two ways that you could help almost immediately are (1) participate in CPAN
  Testers for PDL and related modules, and (2) proofreading and clarifying the
  PDL documentation so that it is most useable for PDL users, especially new
  users.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To participate in CPAN Testers and contribute test reports, the page
  &lt;http://wiki.cpantesters.org/wiki/QuickStart&gt; has instructions for
  starting for either &quot;CPAN&quot; or &quot;CPANPLUS&quot; users.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you have a certain project in mind you should check if somebody else is
  already working on it or if you could benefit from existing modules. Do so by
  posting your planned project to the PDL developers mailing list at
  pdl-devel@lists.sourceforge.net . See the subscription instructions in
  Question 3.2. We are always looking for people to write code and/or
  documentation ;).
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Q:_3.6____I_think_I_have_found_a_bug_in_the_current_version_of_PDL._What_shall_I_do?"><a class="selflink" href="#Q:_3.6____I_think_I_have_found_a_bug_in_the_current_version_of_PDL._What_shall_I_do?">Q:
  3.6 I think I have found a bug in the current version of PDL. What shall I
  do?</a></h2>
First, make sure that the bug/problem you came across has not already been dealt
  with somewhere else in this FAQ. Secondly, you can check the searchable
  archive of the PDL mailing lists to find whether this bug has already been
  discussed. If you still haven't found any explanations you can post a bug
  report to pdl-general@lists.sourceforge.net , or through the Bugs link on
  &lt;http://pdl.perl.org&gt; . See the <i>BUGS</i> file in the PDL distribution
  for what information to include. If you are unsure, discussions via the perldl
  mailing list can be most helpful.

<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Q:_4.1____I_have_problems_installing_PDL._What_shall_I_do?"><a class="selflink" href="#Q:_4.1____I_have_problems_installing_PDL._What_shall_I_do?">Q:
  4.1 I have problems installing PDL. What shall I do?</a></h2>
First make sure you have read the file <i>INSTALL</i> in the distribution. This
  contains a list of common problems which are unnecessary to repeat here.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Next, check the file <i>perldl.conf</i> to see if by editing the configuration
  options in that file you will be able to successfully build PDL. Some of the
  modules need additional software installed, please refer to the file
  <i>DEPENDENCIES</i> for further details. Make sure to edit the location of
  these packages in perldl.conf if you have them in non-standard locations.
<div class="Pp"></div>
N.B. Unix shell specific: If you would like to save an edited perldl.conf for
  future builds just copy it as <i>~/.perldl.conf</i> into your home directory
  where it will be picked up automatically during the PDL build process.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Also, check for another, pre-existing version of PDL on the build system.
  Multiple PDL installs in the same PATH or @INC can cause puzzling test or
  build failures.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you still can't make it work properly please submit a bug report including
  detailed information on the problems you encountered to the perldl mailing
  list ( pdl-general@lists.sourceforge.net , see also above). Response is often
  rapid.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Q:_4.2____Are_there_configuration_files_for_PDL_I_have_to_edit?"><a class="selflink" href="#Q:_4.2____Are_there_configuration_files_for_PDL_I_have_to_edit?">Q:
  4.2 Are there configuration files for PDL I have to edit?</a></h2>
Most users should not have to edit any configuration files manually. However, in
  some cases you might have to supply some information about awkwardly placed
  include files/libraries or you might want to explicitly disable building some
  of the optional PDL modules. Check the files <i>INSTALL</i> and
  <i>perldl.conf</i> for details.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you had to manually edit <i>perldl.conf</i> and are happy with the results
  you can keep the file handy for future reference. Place it in

  4.3 Do I need other software for successful operation?</a></h2>
For the basic PDL functionality you don't need any additional software. However,
  some of the optional PDL modules included in the distribution (notably most
  graphics and some I/O modules) require certain other libraries/programs to be
  installed. Check the file <i>DEPENDENCIES</i> in the distribution for details
  and directions on how to get these.

  4.4 How can I install PDL in a non-standard location?</a></h2>
To install PDL in a non-standard location, use the INSTALL_BASE option in the
  &quot;perl Makefile.PL&quot; configure step. For example, &quot;perl
  Makefile.PL INSTALL_BASE=/mydir/perl5&quot; will configure PDL to install into
  the tree rooted at &quot;/mydir/perl5&quot;. For more details see &quot;How do
  I keep my own module/library directory?&quot; in perlfaq8 and subsequent
  sections. Another alternative is to use local::lib to do the heavy listing for
  the needed configuration.

  4.5 How can I force a completely clean installation?</a></h2>
To guarantee a completely clean installation of PDL, you will need to first
  delete the current installation files and folders. These will be all
  directories named &quot;PDL&quot; in the Perl @INC path, files named
  &quot;*Pdlpp*&quot; in any &quot;Inline&quot; directories, and the programs
  &quot;pdl, pdldoc, pdl2, perldl, and pptemplate&quot;. Then just build and
  install as usual. This is much easier to keep track of if you always install
  &quot;PDL&quot; into a non-standard location. See Q: 4.4 above.

Information about binary distributions of PDL can be found on
  &lt;http://pdl.perl.org&gt; . At present there are binary distributions of PDL
  for Linux (RedHat and Debian), FreeBSD, Mac OS X and Windows, though they
  might not be the most recent version.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If someone is interested in providing binary distributions for other
  architectures, that would be very welcome. Let us know on the
  pdl-devel@lists.sourceforge.net mailing list. Also check your Linux
  distribution's package manager as many now include PDL. PPMs for win32
  versions (both 32bit and 64bit) are also available.

  4.6 Does PDL run on Linux? (And what about packages?)</a></h2>
Yes, PDL does run on Linux and indeed much of the development has been done
  under Linux. On &lt;http://pdl.perl.org&gt; you can find links to packages for
  some of the major distributions. Also check your distribution's package
  manager (yum, apt, urpmi, ...) as PDL is now found by many of these.

PDL builds fine on Win32 using MinGW or Microsoft compilers. See the
  <i>win32/INSTALL</i> file in the PDL source distribution for details. Other
  compilers have not been tested--input is welcome. There is also a distribution
  of PDL through ActiveState's ppm, though it might not always be the latest
  version. PDL-2.018 builds out of the box on Strawberry Perl and ActiveState
  Perl and there are distributions of Strawberry Perl with bundled PDL (see

The first thing you should do is to read the Git documentation and learn the
  basics about Git. There are many sources available online. But here are the
  basics:
<div class="Pp"></div>
Before you upload your changes, commit them to YOUR repository
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   git add &lt;file1&gt; &lt;file2&gt; ...
   git commit
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
or combine these two with
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   git commit -a
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Then pull in any changes others have made
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   git pull origin
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Test the PDL before you push it to the main repository. If the code is broken
  for you, then it is most likely broken for others and they won't be happy to
  have their recent PDL fail to build! NOTE: git makes it very easy to maintain
  a separate branch of development. [ TBD, provide information on how ].
<div class="Pp"></div>
Then update the shared repository (at SF.net) with your changes
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   git push origin master

Unfortunately, in the context of PDL the term threading can have two different

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">When mentioned in the <i>INSTALL</i> directions and
      possibly during the build process we have the usual computer science
      meaning of multi-threading in mind (useful mainly on multiprocessor
      machines or clusters)</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">PDL threading of operations on piddles (as mentioned in the
      indexing docs) is the iteration of a basic operation over appropriate
      sub-slices of piddles, e.g. the inner product &quot;inner $a, $b&quot; of
      a (3) pdl $a and a (3,5,4) pdl $b results in a (5,4) piddle where each
      value is the result of an inner product of the (3) pdl with a (3)
      sub-slice of the (3,5,4) piddle. For details check PDL::Indexing</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
PDL threading leads naturally to potentially parallel code which can make use of
  multi threading on multiprocessor machines/networks; there you have the
  connection between the two types of use of the term.

Well, PDL scalar variables (which are instances of a particular class of Perl
  objects, i.e. blessed thingies (see &quot;perldoc perlobj&quot; )) are in
  common PDL parlance often called <i>piddles</i> (for example, check the
  mailing list archives). Err, clear? If not, simply use the term <i>piddle</i>
  when you refer to a PDL variable (an instance of a PDL object as you might
  remember) regardless of what actual data the PDL variable contains.

  6.4 The docs say piddles are some kind of array. But why doesn't the Perl
  array syntax work with piddles then ?</a></h2>
OK, you are right in a way. The docs say that piddles can be thought of arrays.
  More specifically, it says ( PDL::QuickStart ):
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    I find when using the Perl Data Language it is most useful
    to think of standard Perl @x variables as &quot;lists&quot; of generic
    &quot;things&quot; and PDL variables like $x as &quot;arrays&quot; which can be
    contained in lists or hashes.
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
So, while piddles can be thought of as some kind of multi-dimensional array they
  are <b> not</b> arrays in the Perl sense. Rather, from the point of view of
  Perl they are some special class (which is currently implemented as an opaque
  pointer to some stuff in memory) and therefore need special functions (or
  'methods' if you are using the OO version) to access individual elements or a
  range of elements. The functions/methods to check are &quot;at&quot; /
  &quot;set&quot; (see the section 'Sections' in PDL::QuickStart ) or the
  powerful &quot;slice&quot; function and friends (see PDL::Slices and
  PDL::Indexing and especially PDL::NiceSlice ).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Finally, to confuse you completely, you can have Perl arrays of piddles, e.g.
  $spec[3] can refer to a pdl representing ,e.g, a spectrum, where $spec[3] is
  the fourth element of the Perl list (or array ;) @spec . This may be confusing
  but is very useful !

  6.5 How do I concatenate piddles?</a></h2>
Most people will try to form new piddles from old piddles using some variation
  over the theme: &quot;$a = pdl([$b, 0, 2])&quot; , but this does not work. The
  way to concatenate piddles is to use the function &quot;cat&quot; (see also
  &quot;append&quot; and &quot;glue&quot;). Similarly you can split piddles
  using the command &quot;dog&quot; .

  6.6 Sometimes I am getting these strange results when using inplace
  operations?</a></h2>
This question is related to the &quot;inplace&quot; function. From the
  documentation (see PDL::QuickStart):
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    Most functions, e.g. log(), return a result which is a
    transformation of their argument. This makes for good
    programming practice. However many operations can be done
    &quot;in-place&quot; and this may be required when large arrays are in
    use and memory is at a premium. For these circumstances the
    operator inplace() is provided which prevents the extra copy
    and allows the argument to be modified. e.g.:
    
    $x = log($array);          # $array unaffected
    log( inplace($bigarray) ); # $bigarray changed in situ
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
And also from the doc !!:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    Obviously when used with some functions which can not be
    applied in situ (e.g. convolve()) unexpected effects may
    occur!

  6.8 Why are there two different kinds of assignment in PDL ?</a></h2>
This is caused by the fact that currently the assignment operator &quot;=&quot;
  allows only restricted overloading. For some purposes of PDL it turned out to
  be necessary to have more control over the overloading of an assignment
  operator. Therefore, PDL peruses the operator &quot;.=&quot; for certain types
  of assignments.

  6.9 How do I set a set of values in a piddle?</a></h2>
In Perl 5.6.7 and higher this assignment can be made using lvalue subroutines:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    pdl&gt; $a = sequence(5); p $a
    [0 1 2 3 4]
    pdl&gt; $a-&gt;slice('1:2') .= pdl([5,6])
    pdl&gt; p $a
    [0 5 6 3 4]
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
see PDL::Lvalue for more info. PDL also supports a more matrix-like slice syntax
  via the PDL::NiceSlice module:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    pdl&gt; $a(1:2) .= pdl([5,6])
    pdl&gt; p $a
    [0 5 6 3 4]
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
With versions of Perl prior to 5.6.7 <b>or when running under</b> <b>the perl
  debugger</b> this has to be done using a temporary variable:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    pdl&gt; $a = sequence(5); p $a
    [0 1 2 3 4]
    pdl&gt; $tmp = $a-&gt;slice('1:2'); p $tmp;
    [1 2]
    pdl&gt; $tmp .= pdl([5, 6]);    # Note .= !!
    pdl&gt; p $a
    [0 5 6 3 4]
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This can also be made into one expression, which is often seen in PDL code:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    pdl&gt; ($tmp = $a-&gt;slice('1:2')) .= pdl([5,6])
    pdl&gt; p $a
    [0 5 6 3 4]

  6.10 Can I use a piddle in a conditional expression?</a></h2>
Yes you can, but not in the way you probably tried first. It is not possible to
  use a piddle directly in a conditional expression since this is usually poorly
  defined. Instead PDL has two very useful functions: &quot;any&quot; and
  &quot;all&quot; . Use these to test if any or all elements in a piddle
  fulfills some criterion:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    pdl&gt; $a=pdl ( 1, -2, 3);
    pdl&gt; print '$a has at least one element &lt; 0' if (any $a &lt; 0);
    $a has at least one element &lt; 0
    
    pdl&gt; print '$a is not positive definite' unless (all $a &gt; 0);
    $a is not positive definite
</pre>

  6.11 Logical operators and piddles - '||' and '&amp;&amp;' don't
  work!</a></h2>
It is a common problem that you try to make a mask array or something similar
  using a construct such as
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    $mask = which($piddle &gt; 1 &amp;&amp; $piddle &lt; 2);   # incorrect
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This <b> does not</b> work! What you are looking for is the <b> bitwise</b>
  logical operators '|' and '&amp;' which work on an element-by-element basis.
  So it is really very simple: Do not use logical operators on multi-element
  piddles since that really doesn't make sense, instead write the example as:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    $mask = which($piddle &gt; 1 &amp; $piddle &lt; 2);
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
which works correctly.

  6.12 What is a null pdl ?</a></h2>
&quot;null&quot; is a special token for 'empty piddle'. A null pdl can be used
  to flag to a PDL function that it should create an appropriately sized and
  typed piddle. <i>Null</i> piddles can be used in places where a PDL function
  expects an <i>output</i> or <i>temporary</i> argument. <i>Output</i> and
  <i>temporary</i> arguments are flagged in the <i>signature</i> of a PDL
  function with the &quot;[o]&quot; and &quot;[t]&quot; qualifiers (see next
  question if you don't know what the <i>signature</i> of a PDL function is).
  For example, you can invoke the &quot;sumover&quot; function as follows:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    sumover $a, $b=null;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
which is equivalent to
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    $b = sumover $a;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If this seems still a bit murky check PDL::Indexing and PDL::PP for details
  about calling conventions, the <i>signature</i> and <i>threading</i> (see also
  below).
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Q:_6.13___What_is_the_signature_of_a_PDL_function_?"><a class="selflink" href="#Q:_6.13___What_is_the_signature_of_a_PDL_function_?">Q:
  6.13 What is the signature of a PDL function ?</a></h2>
The <i>signature</i> of a function is an important concept in PDL. Many (but not
  all) PDL function have a <i>signature</i> which specifies the arguments and
  their (minimal) dimensionality. As an example, look at the signature of the
  &quot;maximum&quot; function:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    'a(n); [o] b;'
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
this says that &quot;maximum&quot; takes two arguments, the first of which is
  (at least) one-dimensional while the second one is zero-dimensional and an
  <i>output</i> argument (flagged by the &quot;[o]&quot; qualifier). If the
  function is called with piddles of higher dimension the function will be
  repeatedly called with slices of these piddles of appropriate dimension(this
  is called <i>threading</i> in PDL).
<div class="Pp"></div>

  6.14 How can I subclass (inherit from) piddles?</a></h2>
The short answer is: read PDL::Objects (e.g. type &quot;help PDL::Objects&quot;
  in the <i>perldl</i> or <i>pdl2</i> shell).
<div class="Pp"></div>
The longer answer (extracted from PDL::Objects ): Since a PDL object is an
  opaque reference to a C struct, it is not possible to extend the PDL class by
  e.g. extra data via sub-classing (as you could do with a hash based Perl
  object). To circumvent this problem PDL has built-in support to extend the PDL
  class via the <i>has-a</i> relation for blessed hashes. You can get the
  <i>HAS-A</i> to behave like <i>IS-A</i> simply in that you assign the PDL
  object to the attribute named &quot;PDL&quot; and redefine the method
  <i>initialize()</i>. For example:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    package FOO;
    
    @FOO::ISA = qw(PDL);
    sub initialize {

  6.15 What on earth is this dataflow stuff ?</a></h2>
Dataflow is an experimental project that you don't need to concern yourself with
  (it should not interfere with your usual programming). However, if you want to
  know, have a look at PDL::Dataflow . There are applications which will benefit
  from this feature (and it is already at work behind the scenes).
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Q:_6.16___What_is_PDL::PP?"><a class="selflink" href="#Q:_6.16___What_is_PDL::PP?">Q:
  6.16 What is PDL::PP?</a></h2>
Simple answer: PDL::PP is both a glue between external libraries and PDL and a
  concise language for writing PDL functions.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Slightly longer answer: PDL::PP is used to compile very concise definitions into
  XSUB routines implemented in C that can easily be called from PDL and which
  automatically support threading, dataflow and other things without you having
  to worry about it.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For further details check PDL::PP and the section below on Extensions of PDL.

  6.17 What happens when I have several references to the same PDL object in
  different variables (cloning, etc?) ?</a></h2>
Piddles behave like Perl references in many respects. So when you say
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    $a = pdl [0,1,2,3];
    $b = $a;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
then both $b and $a point to the same object, e.g. then saying
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    $b++;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
will *not* create a copy of the original piddle but just increment in place, of
  which you can convince yourself by saying
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    print $a;
    [1 2 3 4]
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This should not be mistaken for dataflow which connects several *different*
  objects so that data changes are propagated between the so linked piddles
  (though, under certain circumstances, dataflown piddles can share physically
  the same data).
<div class="Pp"></div>
It is important to keep the &quot;reference nature&quot; of piddles in mind when
  passing piddles into subroutines. If you modify the input piddles you modify
  the original argument, <i>not</i> a copy of it. This is different from some
  other array processing languages but makes for very efficient passing of
  piddles between subroutines. If you do not want to modify the original
  argument but rather a copy of it just create a copy explicitly (this example
  also demonstrates how to properly check for an <i>explicit</i> request to
  process inplace, assuming your routine can work inplace):
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    sub myfunc {
       my $pdl = shift;
       if ($pdl-&gt;is_inplace) {
          $pdl-&gt;set_inplace(0)
       } else {
          # modify a copy by default
          $pdl = $pdl-&gt;copy
       }
       $pdl-&gt;set(0,0);
       return $pdl;
    }

Assuming all arrays are of the same size and in some format recognized by
  &quot;rpic&quot; (see PDL::IO::Pic ) you could say:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    use PDL::IO::Pic;
    @names = qw/name1.tif .... nameN.tif/;  # some file names
    $dummy = PDL-&gt;rpic($names[0]);
    $cube = PDL-&gt;zeroes($dummy-&gt;type,$dummy-&gt;dims,$#names+1); # make 3D piddle
    for (0..$#names) {
        # this is the slice assignment
        ($tmp = $cube-&gt;slice(&quot;:,:,($_)&quot;)) .= PDL-&gt;rpic($names[$_]);
    }
</pre>

or
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    $cube(:,:,($_)) .= PDL-&gt;rpic($names[$_]);
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
for the slice assignment using the new PDL::NiceSlice syntax and Lvalue
  assignments.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The for loop reads the actual images into a temporary 2D piddle whose values are
  then assigned (using the overloaded &quot;.=&quot; operator) to the
  appropriate slices of the 3D piddle $cube .

  6.20 Where are test files for the graphics modules?</a></h2>
This answer applies mainly to PDL::Graphics::TriD (PDL's device independent 3D
  graphics model) which is the trickiest one in this respect. You find some test
  scripts in Demos/TriD in the distribution. There are also <i>3dtest.pl</i> and
  <i>line3d.pl</i> in the PDL/Example/TriD directory. After you have built PDL
  you can do:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    perl -Mblib Example/TriD/3dtest.pl
    perl -Mblib Example/TriD/line3d.pl
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
to try the two TriD test programs. They only exercise one TriD function each but
  their simplicity makes it easy to debug if needed with the Perl debugger, see
  perldbug.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The programs in the Demo directory can be run most easily from the
  &quot;perldl&quot; or &quot;pdl2&quot; interactive shell:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    perl -Mblib perldl  or  perl -Mblib Perldl2/pdl2
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
followed by &quot;demo 3d&quot; or &quot;demo 3d2&quot; at the prompt.
  &quot;demo&quot; by itself will give you a list of the available PDL demos.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can run the test scripts in the Demos/TriD directory manually by changing to
  that directory and running
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    perl -Mblib &lt;testfile&gt;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
where &quot;testfile&quot; ; should match the pattern &quot;test[3-9].p&quot;
  and watch the results. Some of the tests should bring up a window where you
  can control (twiddle) the 3D objects with the mouse. Try using mouse button 1
  for turning the objects in 3D space, mouse button 3 to zoom in and out, and
  'q' to advance to the next stage of the test.

Questions like this should be a thing of the past with the PDL on-line help

<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    un*x&gt; pdl2
    pdl&gt; apropos trid

<div class="Pp"></div>
Check the output for promising hits and then try to look up some of them, e.g.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    pdl&gt; help PDL::Graphics::TriD
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>

  6.22 PGPLOT does not write out PNG files.</a></h2>
There are a few sources of trouble with PGPLOT and PNG files. First, when
  compiling the pgplot libraries, make sure you uncomment the PNG entries in the
  <i>drivers.list</i> file. Then when running 'make' you probably got an error
  like
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  C&lt;make: *** No rule to make target `png.h', needed by `pndriv.o'.  Stop.&gt;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
To fix this, find the line in the 'makefile' that starts with 'pndriv.o:' (it's
  near the bottom). Change, for example, ./png.h to /usr/include/png.h, if that
  is where your header files are (you do have the libpng and libz devel
  packages, don't you?). Do this for all four entries on that line, then go back
  and run &quot;make&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Second, if you already have the PGPLOT Perl module and PDL installed, you
  probably tried to write out a PNG file and got fatal error message like:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  C&lt;undefined symbol: png_create_write_struct&gt;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This is because the PGPLOT Perl module does not automatically link against the
  png and z libraries. So when you are installing the PGPLOT Perl module
  (version 2.19) from CPAN, don't do &quot;install PGPLOT&quot;, but just do
  &quot;get PGPLOT&quot;. Then exit from CPAN and manually install PGPLOT,
  calling the makefile thusly:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  C&lt;perl Makefile.PL EXLIB=png,z EXDIR=/usr/lib&gt;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
assuming that there exist files such as /usr/lib/libpng.so.*,
  /usr/lib/libz.so.*. Then do the standard &quot;make;make test;make
  install;&quot; sequence. Now you can write png files from PDL!

The first stop is again &quot;perldl&quot; or &quot;pdl2&quot; and the on-line
  help or the PDL documentation. There is already a lot of functionality in PDL
  which you might not be aware of. The easiest way to look for functionality is
  to use the &quot;apropos&quot; command:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    pdl&gt; apropos 'integral'
    ceil            Round to integral values in floating-point format
    floor           Round to integral values in floating-point format
    intover         Project via integral to N-1 dimensions
    rint            Round to integral values in floating-point format
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Since the apropos command is no sophisticated search engine make sure that you
  search on a couple of related topics and use short phrases.
<div class="Pp"></div>
However there is a good chance that what you need is not part of the PDL
  distribution. You are then well advised to check out
  &lt;http://pdl.perl.org&gt; where there is a list of packages using PDL. If
  that does not solve your problem, ask on the mailing-list, if nothing else you
  might get assistance which will let you interface your package with PDL
  yourself, see also the next question.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Q:_7.2____Can_I_access_my_C/FORTRAN_library_routines_in__PDL?"><a class="selflink" href="#Q:_7.2____Can_I_access_my_C/FORTRAN_library_routines_in__PDL?">Q:
  7.2 Can I access my C/FORTRAN library routines in PDL?</a></h2>
Yes, you can, in fact it is very simple for many simple applications. What you
  want is the PDL pre-processor PP (PDL::PP ). This will allow you to make a
  simple interface to your C routine.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The two functions you need to learn (at least first) are &quot;pp_def&quot;
  which defines the calling interface to the function, specifying input and
  output parameters, and contains the code that links to the external library.
  The other command is &quot;pp_end&quot; which finishes the PP definitions. For
  details see the PDL::PP man-page, but we also have a worked example here.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    double eight_sum(int n)
    {
         int i;
         double sum, x;
    
         sum = 0.0; x=0.0;
         for (i=1; i&lt;=n; i++) {
           x++;
           sum += x/((4.0*x*x-1.0)*(4.0*x*x-1.0));
         } 
         return 1.0/sum;
    }
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
We will here show you an example of how you interface C code with PDL. This is
  the first example and will show you how to approximate the number 8...
<div class="Pp"></div>
The C code is shown above and is a simple function returning a double, and
  expecting an integer - the number of terms in the sum - as input. This
  function could be defined in a library or, as we do here, as an inline
  function.
<div class="Pp"></div>
We will postpone the writing of the Makefile till later. First we will construct
  the &quot;.pd&quot; file. This is the file containing PDL::PP code. We call
  this &quot;eight.pd&quot; .
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    # 
    # pp_def defines a PDL function. 
    #
    pp_addhdr (
    '
    double eight_sum(int n)
    {
      int i;
      double sum, x;
    
      sum = 0.0; x=0.0;
      for (i=1; i&lt;=n; i++) {
       x++; 
       sum += x/((4.0*x*x-1.0)*(4.0*x*x-1.0));
      }
     return 1.0/sum; 
    
    }  
    '); 
    
    pp_def (
            'eight',
         Pars =&gt; 'int a(); double [o]b();',
            Code =&gt; '$b()=eight_sum($a());'
           );
    
    # Always make sure that you finish your PP declarations with
    # pp_done
    
    pp_done();
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
A peculiarity with our example is that we have included the entire code with
  &quot;pp_addhdr&quot; instead of linking it in. This is only for the purposes
  of example, in a typical application you will use &quot;pp_addhdr&quot; to
  include header files. Note that the argument to &quot;pp_addhdr&quot; is
  enclosed in quotes.
<div class="Pp"></div>
What is most important in this example is however the &quot;pp_def&quot;
  command. The first argument to this is the name of the new function <i>eight
  </i> , then comes a hash which the real meat:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This gives the input parameters (here &quot;a&quot;) and
      the output parameters (here &quot;b&quot;). The latter are indicated by
      the &quot;[o]&quot; specifier. Both arguments can have a type
      specification as shown here.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Many variations and further flexibility in the interface can be specified.
      See &quot;perldoc PDL::PP&quot; for details.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This switch contains the code that should be executed. As
      you can see this is a rather peculiar mix of C and Perl, but essentially
      it is just as you would write it in C, but the variables that are passed
      from PDL are treated differently and have to be referred to with a
      preceding '$'.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    There are also simple macros to pass pointers to data and to obtain the
      values of other Perl quantities, see the manual page for further
    details.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Finally note the call to &quot;pp_done()&quot; at the end of the file. This is
  necessary in all PP files.
<div class="Pp"></div>
OK. So now we have a file with code that we dearly would like to use in Perl via
  PDL. To do this we need to compile the function, and to do that we need a
  Makefile.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    use PDL::Core::Dev;
    use ExtUtils::MakeMaker;
    PDL::Core::Dev-&gt;import();
    
    $package = [&quot;eight.pd&quot;,Eight,PDL::Eight];
    %hash = pdlpp_stdargs($package);
    
    WriteMakefile( %hash );
    
    sub MY::postamble {pdlpp_postamble($package)};
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The code above should go in a file called Makefile.PL, which should subsequently
  be called in the standard Perl way: &quot;perl Makefile.PL&quot; . This should
  give you a Makefile and running &quot;make&quot; should compile the module for
  you and &quot;make install&quot; will install it for you.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Q:_7.3____How_can_I_interface_package_XXX_in_PDL?"><a class="selflink" href="#Q:_7.3____How_can_I_interface_package_XXX_in_PDL?">Q:
  7.3 How can I interface package XXX in PDL?</a></h2>
This question is closely related to the previous one, and as we said there, the
  PDL::PP pre-processor is the standard way of interfacing external packages
  with PDL. The most usual way to use PDL::PP is to write a short interface
  routine, see the PDL::PP perldoc page and the answer to the previous question
  for examples.
<div class="Pp"></div>
However it is also possible to interface a package to PDL by re-writing your
  function in PDL::PP directly. This can be convenient in certain situations, in
  particular if you have a routine that expects a function as input and you
  would like to pass the function a Perl function for convenience.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The PDL::PP perldoc page is the main source of information for writing PDL::PP
  extensions, but it is very useful to look for files in the distribution of PDL
  as many of the core functions are written in PDL::PP. Look for files that end
  in &quot;.pd&quot; which is the generally accepted suffix for PDL::PP files.
  But we also have a simple example here.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The following example will show you how to write a simple function that
  automatically allows threading. To make this concise the example is of an
  almost trivial function, but the intention is to show the basics of writing a
  PDL::PP interface.
<div class="Pp"></div>
We will write a simple function that calculates the minimum, maximum and average
  of a piddle. On my machine the resulting function is 8 times faster than the
  built-in function &quot;stats&quot; (of course the latter also calculates the
  median).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Let's jump straight in. Here is the code (from a file called
  &quot;quickstats.pd&quot; )
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    #
    pp_def('quickstats',
         Pars =&gt; 'a(n); [o]avg(); [o]max(); [o]min()',
         Code =&gt; '$GENERIC(a) curmax, curmin;
                  $GENERIC(a) tmp=0;
                     loop(n) %{
                       tmp += $a();
                       if (!n || $a() &gt; curmax) { curmax = $a();}
                       if (!n || $a() &lt; curmin) { curmin = $a();}
                     %}
                     $avg() = tmp/$SIZE(n);
                  $max() = curmax;
                  $min() = curmin;
                    '
         );
    
    pp_done();
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The above might look like a confusing mixture of C and Perl, but behind the
  peculiar syntax lies a very powerful language. Let us take it line by line.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The first line declares that we are starting the definition of a PDL:PP function
  called &quot;quickstats&quot; .
<div class="Pp"></div>
The second line is very important as it specifies the input and output
  parameters of the function. a(n) tells us that there is one input parameter
  that we will refer to as &quot;a&quot; which is expected to be a vector of
  length n (likewise matrices, both square and rectangular would be written as
  &quot;a(n,n)&quot; and &quot;a(n,m)&quot; respectively). To indicate that
  something is an output parameter we put &quot;[o]&quot; in front of their
  names, so referring back to the code we see that avg, max and min are three
  output parameters, all of which are scalar (since they have no dimensional

The third line starts the code definition which is essentially pure C but with a
  couple of convenient functions. $GENERIC is a function that returns the C type
  of its argument - here the input parameter a. Thus the first two lines of the
  code section are variable declarations.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The loop(n) construct is a convenience function that loops over the dimension
  called n in the parameter section. Inside this loop we calculate the
  cumulative sum of the input vector and keep track of the maximum and minimum
  values. Finally we assign the resulting values to the output parameters.

Finally we finish our function declaration with &quot;pp_done()&quot; .

To compile our new function we need to create a Makefile, which we will just
  list since its creation is discussed in an earlier question.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    use PDL::Core::Dev;
    use ExtUtils::MakeMaker;
    PDL::Core::Dev-&gt;import();
    
    $package = [&quot;quickstats.pd&quot;,Quickstats,PDL::Quickstats];
    %hash = pdlpp_stdargs($package);
    
    WriteMakefile( %hash );
    
    sub MY::postamble {pdlpp_postamble($package)};
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
An example Makefile.PL

Our new statistic function should now compile using the tried and tested Perl
  way: &quot;perl Makefile.PL; make&quot; .
<div class="Pp"></div>
You should experiment with this function, changing the calculations and input
  and output parameters. In conjunction with the PDL::PP perldoc page this
  should allow you to quickly write more advanced routines directly in PDL::PP.
