<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
med - NCAR CGM metafile frame editor</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
med [ -e command ]* [ -f sfilename ] [ -l local_dir ] [ -V ]
[ filename]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
med is a frame-level, metafile editor designed to resemble
syntactically UNIX&rsquo;s sed(1) and ed(1). med operates on
a copy of filename, called a buffer, and overwrites a file
<br>
only when you issue the w (write) command. med provides line
oriented editing commands to display or delete frames from
the buffer, to move, copy or merge frames within the
buf&acirc; <br>
fer, or to write frames from and read frames into the
buffer. By default med reads in commands from standard
input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-e command <br>
command is a single med command. The valid med commands are
discussed in the Commands section below. Multiple -e options
may appear on a single command line. Be careful <br>
to use quotes if your command contains spaces or
metacharacters that might be interpreted by the shell. When
this option is used med does not enter interactive mode. It
<br>
simply performs the given commands and then exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f sfilename <br>
Execute the med line-separated list of commands in the file
sfilename. After the commands are exhausted med will
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l local_dir <br>
Use local_dir as the tmp directory for scratch disk space.
If this option is not specified med will use the value of
the $NCARG_TMP or the $TMPDIR environment variable. <br>
See ncargintro(1ncarg) for a discussion on NCAR Graphics
environment variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Print the version number and
then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USAGE <br>
Command Structure <br>
med commands attempt to have a syntactically identical form
to those of ed(1) or sed(1). Commands consist of an optional
address or two optional, comma separated, addresses, <br>
followed by a command, which may be abbreviated, possibly
followed by a third address or a command specific argument
list :</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[ address [, address ] ] command
[ address | args ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If only one address is
specified, operations are performed on that frame. If two
addresses are specified, med performs the operation on the
inclusive range of frames. If no <br>
address is specified then the current frame is used as a
default. The exception to this are the w (write) and the a
(append) commands. The default address for w is the entire
<br>
buffer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, 1,10p means
&acirc;print (display) frame 1 through 10&acirc; (two
addresses), d means &acirc;delete the current frame&acirc;
(no address implies the current frame used as default), and
<br>
1,5c5 means &acirc;append a copy of frames 1 through 5 at
frame 5&acirc; (three addresses). The meaning of argument
varies for each operation. In med&rsquo;s current state the
only valid argument <br>
is a filename &acirc; for the write, w , command for
instance, argument is the name of the file to write to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unlike its friends ed(1) and
sed(1) med attempts to be fairly user friendly. If an
invalid or ambiguous command is given med will tell you so.
If med thinks it recognizes a com&acirc; <br>
mand with invalid arguments a usage statement for the
offending command is given. If a particular command fails
and med is smart enough to figure out why it will tell you.
med <br>
will almost ALWAYS immediately terminate when an error
occurs while processing commands from a file or the command
line. Help is available by using the h command. Usage
state&acirc; <br>
ments for a particular command may be obtained with: h
command name .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Addresses <br>
Frames can be addressed in several ways:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nnn By frame number. Frames in
the buffer are numbered relative to the start of the buffer.
The first frame is frame 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ The last frame of the
buffer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">. The current frame. med keeps
track of the frame on which you last performed an operation.
This frame is called the current frame. You can address this
frame by typing a <br>
&acirc;dot&acirc; character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&plusmn;n By relative
frame number. Address the frame number that is n frames
higher, or n frames lower than the current frame.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">address&Acirc;&plusmn;n <br>
An address followed by a plus sign (+) or a minus sign (-),
followed by a decimal number, specifies that address plus or
minus the indicated number of frames. If the <br>
address is omitted, the current frame is used as the base.
For example, &lsquo;31-3&rsquo; addresses frame 28 in the
buffer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you do not specify an address
for a command to operate on, a command that requires an
address supplies one by default, usually the current
frame.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A pair of addresses separated by
a comma signifies an inclusive range of frames, and the
current frame is not changed unless the command changes
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Commands <br>
Only one command may appear per line. Commands may accept
zero, one or two addresses, followed by possibly a third
address or an argument. Commands that accept up to two <br>
addresses regard a third as an error. Likewise, commands
that do not accept an argument regard one as an error.
Commands may be abbreviated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the absence of a second
address for a two or three address command the command will
regard the second address as the same as the first. For
example, 2d is equivalent to 2,2d . <br>
The absence of a first address, where required, will result
in the current frame being used as the default. The same is
true in the absence of a required third address. For
exam&acirc; <br>
ple, c is equivalent to .,.c..</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The commands q (quit) and e
(edit) may be followed by a &rsquo;!&rsquo; to override
med&rsquo;s user protection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the following list of med
commands, the default addresses/arguments appear in
parentheses; the parenthesized addresses are not part of the
command. Unless otherwise noted a <br>
command does not change the current frame number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(1,$)append metafile <br>
Append buffer to a file. Append the addressed frames in the
buffer to metafile. If no address is specified the entire
buffer is written. If the file does not exist create <br>
it. <br>
(.,.) copy (.) <br>
Copy frames. Duplicate the addressed frames in the buffer
and append them after the third address. The current frame
becomes the destination of the last frame copied. <br>
(.,.)delete <br>
Delete the addressed lines from the buffer. delete accepts
one or two addresses; the default is the current frame. The
current frame is set to the first frame after the <br>
deleted frame(s). <br>
edit metafile <br>
Edit a metafile. The current contents of the buffer, if any,
are erased. The named metafile is read in to the buffer. The
resulting current frame is the last frame in the <br>
buffer. If changes have been made to the buffer since the
last write med will refuse the request unless the command is
appended with a &rsquo;!&rsquo;. edit prints the number of
<br>
frames in the metafile. If no metafile is given, the current
metafile, if any is used. The current frame becomes the last
frame in the file. <br>
help command <br>
help. Give a usage message for command . If no command is
given, print list of command names with a short description
of each. <br>
(.,.)label string <br>
Label the addressed frames with string . The CGM Begin
Picture element contained in each metafile frame allows for
the encoding of character data. label provides a means <br>
for accessing this data. <br>
(.,.)merge <br>
Merge the contents of the second addressed frame on top of
the first addressed frame. The first addressed frame is thus
changed. The second frame remains the same. The <br>
current frame is set to the first addressed frame. <br>
(.,.) move (.) <br>
Move the addressed frames to the first frame following the
third address. <br>
(.,.)print <br>
Show the contents of the buffer at the given address. What
is actually displayed is information regarding the addressed
frames. This information includes: relative frame <br>
number within the buffer, the number of records contained in
the frame, the starting record for the frame and the
contents of the CGM element BEGIN PICTURE . If no <br>
address is specified the current frame does not change.
Otherwise it becomes the last frame printed. <br>
quit <br>
Quit. Terminate the editing session without saving the
buffer contents. In order to save the buffer an explicit
write must be performed. If changes to the buffer have been
<br>
made since the last write med will refuse to terminate
unless quit is appended with a &rsquo;!&rsquo;. <br>
(.)read metafile <br>
Read in a metafile. Read the contents of metafile into the
buffer and append it at the given address. metafile must be
a valid NCAR CGM. The resulting current frame is <br>
the last frame read in. <br>
(1,$)split&lt;number&gt; outfile <br>
Split the current metafile into number files. The split
command attempts to create number metafiles from the
addressed frames, each containing approximately n / number
<br>
frames where &rsquo;n&rsquo; is the total number of
addressed frames. The first file is named outfile001.ncgm,
the second file is named outfile002.ncgm, and so on
lexicographically. <br>
If no outfile is given, med is used as the default (output
files will be called med001.ncgm, med002.ncgm, etc.). <br>
(1,$)write metafile <br>
Write buffer. Write the addressed frames in the buffer to
metafile. If no address is specified the entire buffer is
written. If the file does not exist create it. If no <br>
file name is specified med uses the last currently
remembered file name, if any. The currently remembered file
name is the file name from the most recent edit command, or
<br>
the file name med was invoked with if no edit commands have
been issued. <br>
! command <br>
Escape to the shell and execute command. command is a valid
UNIX command. ENVIRONMENT <br>
NCARG_TMP <br>
If set, this environment variable contains a directory path
to be used for temporary files. On most systems the default
is /tmp. FILES <br>
/tmp/cgm_tools.# temporary; # is the process id.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
To concatenate the files ncgm1, ncgm2, and ncgm3 into a
single file ncgm123 one might use the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% med -e &rsquo;r ncgm1&rsquo;
-e &rsquo;r ncgm2&rsquo; -e &rsquo;r ncgm3&rsquo; -e
&rsquo;w ncgm123&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Or one could pass the following
script to med as a -fscriptfile option or enter the commands
interactively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">r ncgm1 <br>
r ncgm2 <br>
r ncgm3 <br>
w ncgm123</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To Overlay the contents of frame
5 on top of frame 4 from a file ncgm1 one could execute:
<br>
% med -e &rsquo;4,5 me&rsquo; -e &rsquo;w!&rsquo; ncgm1</p>

med <br>
does not understand filenames that begin with a digit or a
period.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CAVEATS <br>
The append, read and merge commands may produce surprising
results. A CGM may contain a set of global graphical
primitive attributes that are applied to every frame in a
file. <br>
Thus reading frames in from a file with different global
attributes than the current working file may not produce the
desired effect. The same is true when appending frames to a
<br>
previously existing file. Similarly, the CGM standard
specifies that graphical attributes specified within a
metafile frame affect all succeeding primitives. Thus a
frame which <br>
is the product of the merge command may appear differently
than expected. COPYRIGHT <br>
