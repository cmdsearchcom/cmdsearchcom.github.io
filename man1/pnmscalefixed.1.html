pnmscale - scale a PNM file quickly

This program is part of <b>Netpbm</b>(1)
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>pnmscalefixed</b> is like <b>pamscale</b> except that it uses fixed point
  arithmetic internally instead of floating point, which makes it run faster. In
  turn, it is less accurate and may distort the image. It also lacks many of the
  features of <b>pamscale</b>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Use the <b>pamscale</b> user manual with <b>pnmscalefixed</b>. This document
  only describes the difference. Avoid any feature mentioned in the
  <b>pamscale</b> manual as not existing before Netpbm 9.9.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>pnmscalefixed</b> uses fixed point 12 bit arithmetic. By contrast,
  <b>pamscale</b> uses floating point arithmetic which on most machines is
  probably 24 bit precision. This makes <b>pnmscalefixed</b> run faster (30%
  faster in one experiment), but the imprecision can cause distortions at the
  right and bottom edges.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The distortion takes the following form: One pixel from the edge of the input is
  rendered larger in the output than the scaling factor requires. Consequently,
  the rest of the image is smaller than the scaling factor requires, because the
  overall dimensions of the image are always as requested. This distortion will
  usually be very hard to see.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>pnmscalefixed</b> with the <b>-verbose</b> option tells you how much
  distortion there is.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The amount of distortion depends on the size of the input image and how close
  the scaling factor is to an integral 1/4096th.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the scaling factor is an exact multiple of 1/4096, there is no distortion.
  So, for example doubling or halving an image causes no distortion. But
  reducing it or enlarging it by a third would cause some distortion. To
  consider an extreme case, scaling a 100,000 row image down to 50,022 rows
  would create an output image with all of the input squeezed into the top
  50,000 rows, and the last row of the input copied into the bottom 22 rows of
  output.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>pnmscalefixed</b> could probably be modified to use 16 bit or better
  arithmetic without losing anything. The modification would consist of a single
  constant in the source code. Until there is a demonstrated need for that,
  though, the Netpbm maintainer wants to keep the safety cushion afforded by the
  original 12 bit precision.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>pnmscalefixed</b> does not have <b>pamscale</b>'s <b>-nomix</b> option.</div>
