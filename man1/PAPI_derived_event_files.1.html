<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
PAPI_derived_event_files - Describes derived event
definition file syntax.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Derived Events <br>
PAPI provides the ability to define events whose value will
be derived from multiple native events. The list of native
events to be used in a derived event and a formula which
<br>
describes how to use them is provided in an event definition
file. The PAPI team provides an event definition file which
describes all of the supported PAPI preset events. PAPI <br>
also allows a user to provide an event definition file that
describes a set of user defined events which can extend the
events PAPI normally supports.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This page documents the syntax
of the commands which can appear in an event definition
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">General Rules: <br>
&Acirc;&middot; Blank lines are ignored. <br>
&Acirc;&middot; Lines that begin with &rsquo;#&rsquo; are
comments (they are also ignored). <br>
&Acirc;&middot; Names shown inside &lt; &gt; below represent
values that must be provided by the user. <br>
&Acirc;&middot; If a user provided value contains white
space, it must be protected with quotes. <br>
Commands: <br>
CPU,&lt;pmuName&gt; <br>
Specifies a PMU name which controls if the PRESET and EVENT
commands that follow this line should be processed. Multiple
CPU commands can be entered without PRESET or EVENT <br>
commands between them to provide a list of PMU names to
which the derived events that follow will apply. When a PMU
name provided in the list matches a PMU name known to the
<br>
running system, the events which follow will be created. If
none of the PMU names provided in the list match a PMU name
on the running system, the events which follow will be <br>
ignored. When a new CPU command follows either a PRESET or
EVENT command, the PMU list is rebuilt.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">PRESET,&lt;eventName&gt;,&lt;derivedType&gt;,&lt;eventAttr&gt;,LDESC,&quot;&lt;longDesc&gt;&quot;,SDESC,&quot;&lt;shortDesc&gt;&quot;,NOTE,&quot;&lt;note&gt;&quot;
<br>
Declare a PAPI preset derived event.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">EVENT,&lt;eventName&gt;,&lt;derivedType&gt;,&lt;eventAttr&gt;,LDESC,&quot;&lt;longDesc&gt;&quot;,SDESC,&quot;&lt;shortDesc&gt;&quot;,NOTE,&quot;&lt;note&gt;&quot;
<br>
Declare a user defined derived event.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Where:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pmuName: <br>
The PMU which the following events should apply to. A list
of PMU names supported by your system can be obtained by
running papi_component_avail on your system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">eventName: <br>
Specifies the name used to identify this derived event. This
name should be unique within the events on your system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">derivedType: <br>
Specifies the kind of derived event being defined (see
&rsquo;Derived Types&rsquo; below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">eventAttr: <br>
Specifies a formula and a list of base events that are used
to compute the derived events value. The syntax of this
field depends on the &rsquo;derivedType&rsquo; specified
above (see <br>
&rsquo;Derived Types&rsquo; below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">longDesc: <br>
Provides the long description of the event.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">shortDesc: <br>
Provides the short description of the event.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">note: <br>
Provides an event note.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">baseEvent (used below): <br>
Identifies an event on which this derived event is based.
This may be a native event (possibly with event masks), an
already known preset event, or an already known user <br>
event. <br>
Notes: <br>
The PRESET command has traditionally been used in the PAPI
provided preset definition file. The EVENT command is
intended to be used in user defined event definition files.
The <br>
code treats them the same so they are interchangeable and
they can both be used in either event definition file. <br>
Derived Types: <br>
This describes values allowed in the
&rsquo;derivedType&rsquo; field of the PRESET and EVENT
commands. It also shows the syntax of the
&rsquo;eventAttr&rsquo; field for each derived type
supported by <br>
these commands. All of the derived events provide a list of
one or more events which the derived event is based on
(baseEvent). Some derived events provide a formula that <br>
specifies how to compute the derived events value using the
baseEvents in the list. The following derived types are
supported, the syntax of the &rsquo;eventAttr&rsquo;
parameter for each <br>
derived event type is shown in parentheses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOT_DERIVED (&lt;baseEvent&gt;):
<br>
This derived type defines an alias for the existing event
&rsquo;baseEvent&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DERIVED_ADD
(&lt;baseEvent1&gt;,&lt;baseEvent2&gt;): <br>
This derived type defines a new event that will be the sum
of two other events. It has a value of
&rsquo;baseEvent1&rsquo; plus &rsquo;baseEvent2&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DERIVED_PS
(PAPI_TOT_CYC,&lt;baseEvent1&gt;): <br>
This derived type defines a new event that will report the
number of &rsquo;baseEvent1&rsquo; events which occurred per
second. It has a value of (((&rsquo;baseEvent1&rsquo; *
cpu_max_mhz) * 1000000 <br>
) / PAPI_TOT_CYC). The user must provide PAPI_TOT_CYC as the
first event of two events in the event list for this to work
correctly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DERIVED_ADD_PS
(PAPI_TOT_CYC,&lt;baseEvent1&gt;,&lt;baseEvent2&gt;): <br>
This derived type defines a new event that will add together
two event counters and then report the number which occurred
per second. It has a value of ((((&rsquo;baseEvent1&rsquo; +
<br>
baseEvent2) * cpu_max_mhz) * 1000000 ) / PAPI_TOT_CYC). The
user must provide PAPI_TOT_CYC as the first event of three
events in the event list for this to work correctly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DERIVED_CMPD
(&lt;baseEvent1&gt;,&lt;baseEvent2): <br>
This derived type works much like the NOT_DERIVED type. It
is rarely used and it looks like the code just returns a
single value returned from the kernel. There is no <br>
calculation done to compute this events value. Not sure why
multiple input events seem to be needed to use this event
type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DERIVED_SUB
(&lt;baseEvent1&gt;,&lt;baseEvent2&gt;): <br>
This derived type defines a new event that will be the
difference between two other events. It has a value of
&rsquo;baseEvent1&rsquo; minus &rsquo;baseEvent2&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DERIVED_POSTFIX
(&lt;pfFormula&gt;,&lt;baseEvent1&gt;,&lt;baseEvent2&gt;,
... ,&lt;baseEventn&gt;): <br>
This derived type defines a new event whose value is
computed from several native events using a postfix (reverse
polish notation) formula. Its value is the result of <br>
processing the postfix formula. The &rsquo;pfFormula&rsquo;
is of the form &rsquo;N0|N1|N2|5|*|+|-|&rsquo; where the
&rsquo;|&rsquo; acts as a token separator and the tokens N0,
N1, and N2 are place holders <br>
that represent baseEvent0, baseEvent1, and baseEvent2
respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DERIVED_INFIX
(&lt;ifFormula&gt;,&lt;baseEvent1&gt;,&lt;baseEvent2&gt;,
... ,&lt;baseEventn&gt;): <br>
This derived type defines a new event whose value is
computed from several native events using an infix
(algebraic notation) formula. Its value is the result of
processing <br>
the infix formula. The &rsquo;ifFormula&rsquo; is of the
form &rsquo;N0-(N1+(N2*5))&rsquo; where the tokens N0, N1,
and N2 are place holders that represent baseEvent0,
baseEvent1, and baseEvent2 <br>
respectively. <br>
Example: <br>
In the following example, the events PAPI_SP_OPS,
USER_SP_OPS, and ALIAS_SP_OPS will all measure the same
events and return the same value. They just demonstrate
different ways <br>
to use the PRESET and EVENT event definition commands.</p>
