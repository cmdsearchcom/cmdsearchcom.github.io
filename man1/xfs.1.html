<p>xfs(1) General Commands Manual xfs(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
xfs - X font server</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
xfs [ -config configuration_file ] [ -daemon ] [ -droppriv ]
[ -inetd ] [ -ls listen_socket ] [ -nodaemon ] [ -port
tcp_port ] [ -user username ] [ -version ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
xfs is the X Window System font server. It supplies fonts to
X Window System display servers. The server is usually run
by a system administrator, and started via init(8) or <br>
inetd(8). Users may also wish to start private font servers
for specific sets of fonts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To connect to a font server, see
the documentation for your X server; it likely supports the
syntax documented in the &acirc;FONT SERVER NAMES&acirc;
section of X(7).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-config configuration_file <br>
specifies the configuration file xfs will use. If this
parameter is not specified, xfs will read its configuration
from the default file, /etc/X11/fs/config.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-daemon <br>
instructs xfs to fork and go into the background
automatically at startup. If this option is not specified,
xfs will run as a regular process (unless it was built to
dae&acirc; <br>
monize by default). When running as a daemon, xfs will
attempt to create a file in which it stores its process ID,
and will delete that file upon exit;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-droppriv <br>
instructs xfs to attempt to run as user and group xfs
(unless the -user option is used). This has been implemented
for security reasons, as xfs may have undiscovered
buf&acirc; <br>
fer overflows or other paths for possible exploit, both
local and remote. When using this option, you may also wish
to specify &acirc;no-listen = tcp&acirc; in the config file,
which <br>
ensures that xfs will not to use a TCP port at all. By
default, xfs runs with the user and group IDs of the user
who invoked it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-inetd informs xfs that it is
being started by inetd, and that a listening socket on the
appropriate port is being passed as standard input. Assumes
that inetd is configured to <br>
&quot;wait&quot; mode, and will thus allow xfs to handle
listening for and accepting further connections on this
port. This allows xfs to be started on demand when the first
font <br>
client connects. When using this option, the -daemon and
-port flags are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ls listen_socket <br>
specifies a file descriptor which is already set up to be
used as the listen socket. This option is only intended to
be used by the font server itself when automatically <br>
spawning another copy of itself to handle additional
connections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nodaemon <br>
instructs xfs not to daemonize (fork and detach from its
controlling terminal). This option only has an effect if xfs
is built to daemonize by default, which is not the <br>
stock configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-port tcp_port <br>
specifies the TCP port number on which the server will
listen for connections. The default port number is 7100.
This option is ignored if xfs is configured to not listen
<br>
to TCP transports at all (see &acirc;Configuration File
Format&acirc; below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-user username <br>
instructs xfs to run as the user username. See -droppriv for
why this may be desired. By default, xfs runs with the user
and group IDs of the user who invoked it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-version <br>
instructs xfs to print the program version and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUT FILES <br>
xfs reads and serves any font file format recognized by the
X server itself. It locates font files through the
specification of a catalogue, which is declared in
xfs&rsquo;s configu&acirc; <br>
ration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Configuration File Format <br>
xfs reads its configuration from a text file (see the
-config option in the &acirc;OPTIONS&acirc; section above).
The configuration language is a list of keyword and value
pairs. Each key&acirc; <br>
word is followed by an equals sign (&acirc;=&acirc;) and
then the desired value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Recognized keywords include:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">alternate-servers (list of
strings) <br>
lists alternate servers for this font server. See the
&acirc;FONT SERVER NAMES&acirc; section of X(7) for the
syntax of the string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">catalogue (list of strings) <br>
declares as ordered list of font path element names from
which fonts will be served. The current implementation only
supports a single catalogue (&quot;all&quot;) containing all
of <br>
the specified fonts. A special directory with symlinks to
font paths can be specified using a catalogue:&lt;dir&gt;
entry. See the CATALOGUE DIR section below for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">client-limit (cardinal) <br>
determines the number of clients this font server will
support before refusing service. This is useful for tuning
the load on each individual font server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">clone-self (boolean) <br>
indicates whether this font server should attempt to clone
itself when the number of connected clients reaches the
client-limit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">default-point-size (cardinal)
<br>
The default pointsize (in decipoints) for font requests that
don&rsquo;t specify a point size. The default is 120.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">default-resolutions (list of
resolutions) <br>
indicates the resolutions the server supports by default.
This information may be used as a hint for pre-rendering,
and substituted into requests for scaled fonts which <br>
do not specify a resolution. A resolution is a
comma-separated pair of horizontal and vertical resolutions
in pixels per inch. Multiple resolutions are separated by
com&acirc; <br>
mas.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">deferglyphs (string) <br>
sets the mode for delayed fetching and caching of glyphs.
string should be one of &acirc;none&acirc;, meaning glyphs
deferment is disabled, &acirc;all&acirc;, meaning it is
enabled for all <br>
fonts, and &acirc;16&acirc;, meaning it is enabled only for
16-bit fonts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">error-file (string) <br>
indicates the filename of the error file. All warnings and
errors will be logged here, unless use-syslog is set to a
true value (see below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">no-listen (trans-type) <br>
disables the specified transport type. For example, TCP/IP
connections can be disabled with &acirc;no-listen =
tcp&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">port (cardinal) <br>
indicates the TCP port on which the server will listen for
connections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use-syslog (boolean) <br>
determines whether errors and diagnostics should be reported
via syslog(3) (on supported systems) instead of being
written to the error-file (see above).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CATALOGUE DIR <br>
You can specify a special kind of font path in the form
catalogue:&lt;dir&gt;. The directory specified after the
catalogue: prefix will be scanned for symlinks and each
symlink desti&acirc; <br>
nation will be added as a local fontfile FPE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The symlink can be suffixed by
attributes such as &rsquo;unscaled&rsquo;, which will be
passed through to the underlying fontfile FPE. The only
exception is the newly introduced &rsquo;pri&rsquo; <br>
attribute, which will be used for ordering the font paths
specified by the symlinks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An example configuration:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">75dpi:unscaled:pri=20 -&gt;
/usr/share/X11/fonts/75dpi <br>
ghostscript:pri=60 -&gt;
/usr/share/fonts/default/ghostscript <br>
misc:unscaled:pri=10 -&gt; /usr/share/X11/fonts/misc <br>
type1:pri=40 -&gt; /usr/share/X11/fonts/Type1 <br>
type1:pri=50 -&gt; /usr/share/fonts/default/Type1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This will add
/usr/share/X11/fonts/misc as the first FPE with the
attribute the attribute unscaled etc. This is functionally
equivalent to setting the following font path:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">/usr/share/X11/fonts/misc:unscaled,
<br>
/usr/share/X11/fonts/75dpi:unscaled, <br>
/usr/share/X11/fonts/Type1, <br>
/usr/share/fonts/default/Type1, <br>
/usr/share/fonts/default/ghostscript</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example Configuration File <br>
# <br>
# sample font server configuration file <br>
#</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># allow a max of 10 clients to
connect to this font server. <br>
client-limit = 10</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># When a font server reaches the
above limit, start up a new one. <br>
clone-self = on</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Identify alternate font
servers for clients to use. <br>
alternate-servers = hansen:7101,hansen:7102</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Look for fonts in the
following directories. The first is a set of <br>
# TrueType outlines, the second is a set of misc bitmaps
(such as terminal <br>
# and cursor fonts), and the last is a set of 100dpi
bitmaps. <br>
# <br>
catalogue = /usr/share/X11/fonts/TTF, <br>
/usr/share/X11/fonts/misc, <br>
/usr/share/X11/fonts/100dpi/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># in 12 points, decipoints <br>
default-point-size = 120</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># 100 x 100 and 75 x 75 <br>
default-resolutions = 100,100,75,75</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Specify our log filename. <br>
error-file = /var/log/xfs.log</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Direct diagnostics to our own
log file instead of using syslog. <br>
use-syslog = off</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT FILES <br>
When operating in daemon mode, xfs sends diagnostic messages
(errors and warnings) to the log file specified by the
error-file configuration variable by default. However, these
<br>
messages can be sent to an alternate location via the
error-file and use-syslog configuration variables; see
&acirc;Configuration File Format&acirc;, above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS <br>
xfs handles the following signals specially:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGTERM <br>
causes the font server to exit cleanly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGUSR1 <br>
causes xfs to re-read its configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGUSR2 <br>
causes xfs to flush any cached data it may have.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGHUP causes xfs to reset,
closing all active connections and re-reading the
configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Multiple catalogues should be supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FUTURE DIRECTIONS <br>
Significant further development of xfs is unlikely. One of
the original motivations behind it was the single-threaded
nature of the X server &acirc; a user&rsquo;s X session
could seem to <br>
&acirc;freeze up&acirc; while the X server took a moment to
rasterize a font. This problem with the X server, which
remains single-threaded in all popular implementations to
this day, has <br>
been mitigated on two fronts: machines have gotten much
faster, and client-side font rendering (particularly via the
Xft library) is the norm in contemporary software.</p>
