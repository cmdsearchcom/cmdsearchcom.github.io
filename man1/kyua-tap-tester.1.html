<p>KYUA-TAP-TESTER(1) BSD General Commands Manual
KYUA-TAP-TESTER(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
kyua-tap-tester &acirc; Scriptable interface to interact
with TAP-compliant test programs</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
kyua-tap-tester [generic_flags] subcommand
[subcommand_flags] [subcommand_args]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
kyua-tap-tester provides a scriptable interface to interact
with test programs that comply with the Test Anything
Protocol. This manual page describes the specific features
that <br>
apply to this specific tester. For the generic manual page,
which describes the command-line interface in detail, please
see kyua-tester(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TAP-compliant test programs are
able to contain various independent test cases and can
report results information for each of them independently.
However, such test programs are <br>
not designed to expose this structure upfront and, from
Kyua&rsquo;s point of view, they are made up of a single
test case. This has implications in the way the tester
interacts with <br>
the test program, as described below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Test cases list <br>
Because TAP-compliant test programs have no ability to
describe their internal structure without actually running
the tests, kyua-tap-tester will always report a single test
case <br>
as the output of &acirc;list&acirc;. This is normal and
expected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Execution <br>
Because TAP-compliant test programs have no ability to
describe their internal structure without actually running
the tests, kyua-tap-tester will always run all tests within
the <br>
test program in a single process space. Internal failures in
the test program that make it abort may cause the rest of
the test program to fail.</p>
