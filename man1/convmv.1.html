<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
convmv - converts filenames from one encoding to another</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
convmv [options] FILE(S) ... DIRECTORY(S)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-f ENCODING <br>
specify the current encoding of the filename(s) from which
should be converted</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t ENCODING <br>
specify the encoding to which the filename(s) should be
converted</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i interactive mode (ask y/n for
each action)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r recursively go through
directories</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--nfc <br>
target files will be normalization form C for UTF-8 (Linux
etc.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--nfd <br>
target files will be normalization form D for UTF-8 (OS X
etc.).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--qfrom , --qto <br>
be more quiet about the &quot;from&quot; or &quot;to&quot;
of a rename (if it screws up your terminal e.g.). This will
in fact do nothing else than replace any non-ASCII character
(bytewise) <br>
with ? and any control character with * on printout, this
does not affect rename operation itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--exec command <br>
execute the given command. You have to quote the command and
#1 will be substituted by the old, #2 by the new filename.
Using this option link targets will stay untouched.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">convmv -f latin1 -t utf-8 -r
--exec &quot;echo #1 should be renamed to #2&quot;
path/to/files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--list <br>
list all available encodings. To get support for more
Chinese or Japanese encodings install the Perl HanExtra or
JIS2K Encode packages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--lowmem <br>
keep memory footprint low by not creating a hash of all
files. This disables checking if symlink targets are in
subtree. Symlink target pointers will be converted <br>
regardlessly. If you convert multiple hundredthousands or
millions of files the memory usage of convmv might grow
quite high. This option would help you out in that case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--nosmart <br>
by default convmv will detect if a filename is already UTF8
encoded and will skip this file if conversion from some
charset to UTF8 should be performed. &quot;--nosmart&quot;
will <br>
also force conversion to UTF-8 for such files, which might
result in &quot;double encoded UTF-8&quot; (see section
below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--fixdouble <br>
using the &quot;--fixdouble&quot; option convmv does only
convert files which will still be UTF-8 encoded after
conversion. That&rsquo;s useful for fixing double-encoded
UTF-8 files. All <br>
files which are not UTF-8 or will not result in UTF-8 after
conversion will not be touched. Also see chapter &quot;How
to undo double UTF-8 ...&quot; below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--notest <br>
Needed to actually rename the files. By default convmv will
just print what it wants to do.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--parsable <br>
This is an advanced option that people who want to write a
GUI front end will find useful (some others maybe, too). It
will convmv make print out what it would do in an easy <br>
parsable way. The first column contains the action or some
kind of information, the second column mostly contains the
file that is to be modified and if appropriate the third
<br>
column contains the modified value. Each column is separated
by (nullbyte newline). Each row (one action) is separated by
(nullbyte nullbyte newline).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--preserve-mtimes <br>
modifying filenames usually causes the parent
directory&rsquo;s mtime being updated. This option allows to
reset the mtime to the old value. If your filesystem
supports sub-second <br>
resolution the sub-second part of the atime and mtime will
be lost as Perl does not yet support that.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--replace <br>
if the file to which shall be renamed already exists, it
will be overwritten if the other file content is equal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--unescape <br>
this option will remove this ugly % hex sequences from
filenames and turn them into (hopefully) nicer 8-bit
characters. After --unescape you might want to do a charset
<br>
conversion. This sequences like %20 etc. are sometimes
produced when downloading via http or ftp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--upper , --lower <br>
turn filenames into all upper or all lower case. When the
file is not ASCII-encoded, convmv expects a charset to be
entered via the -f switch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dotlessi <br>
care about the dotless i/I issue. A lowercase version of
&quot;I&quot; will also be dotless while an uppercase
version of &quot;i&quot; will also be dotted. This is an
issue for Turkish and <br>
Azeri.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By the way: The superscript dot
of the letter i was added in the Middle Ages to distinguish
the letter (in manuscripts) from adjacent vertical strokes
in such letters as u, <br>
m, and n. J is a variant form of i which emerged at this
time and subsequently became a separate letter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help <br>
print a short summary of available options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dump-options <br>
print a list of all available options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
convmv is meant to help convert a single filename, a
directory tree and the contained files or a whole filesystem
into a different encoding. It just converts the filenames,
not <br>
the content of the files. A special feature of convmv is
that it also takes care of symlinks, also converts the
symlink target pointer in case the symlink target is being
<br>
converted, too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All this comes in very handy
when one wants to switch over from old 8-bit locales to
UTF-8 locales. It is also possible to convert directories to
UTF-8 which are already partly <br>
UTF-8 encoded. convmv is able to detect if certain files are
UTF-8 encoded and will skip them by default. To turn this
smartness off use the &quot;--nosmart&quot; switch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Filesystem issues <br>
Almost all POSIX filesystems do not care about how filenames
are encoded, here are some exceptions:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HFS+ on OS X / Darwin</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Linux and (most?) other
Unix-like operating systems use the so called normalization
form C (NFC) for its UTF-8 encoding by default but do not
enforce this. Darwin, the base of <br>
the Macintosh OS enforces normalization form D (NFD), where
a few characters are encoded in a different way. On OS X
it&rsquo;s not possible to create NFC UTF-8 filenames
because this <br>
is prevented at filesystem layer. On HFS+ filenames are
internally stored in UTF-16 and when converted back to
UTF-8, for the underlying BSD system to be handable, NFD is
<br>
created. See
http://developer.apple.com/qa/qa2001/qa1173.html for
defails. I think it was a very bad idea and breaks many
things under OS X which expect a normal POSIX <br>
conforming system. Anywhere else convmv is able to convert
files from NFC to NFD or vice versa which makes
interoperability with such systems a lot easier.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">JFS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If people mount JFS partitions
with iocharset=utf8, there is a similar problem, because JFS
is designed to store filenames internally in UTF-16, too;
that is because Linux&rsquo; JFS <br>
is really JFS2, which was a rewrite of JFS for OS/2. JFS
partitions should always be mounted with
iocharset=iso8859-1, which is also the default with recent
2.6.6 kernels. If <br>
this is not done, JFS does not behave like a POSIX
filesystem and it might happen that certain files cannot be
created at all, for example filenames in ISO-8859-1
encoding. Only <br>
when interoperation with OS/2 is needed iocharset should be
set according to your used locale charmap.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NFS4</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Despite other POSIX filesystems
RFC3530 (NFS 4) mandates UTF-8 but also says: &quot;The
nfs4_cs_prep profile does not specify a normalization form.
A later revision of this <br>
specification may specify a particular normalization
form.&quot; In other words, if you want to use NFS4 you
might find the conversion and normalization features of
convmv quite <br>
useful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FAT/VFAT and NTFS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NTFS and VFAT (for long
filenames) use UTF-16 internally to store filenames. You
should not need to convert filenames if you mount one of
those filesystems. Use appropriate <br>
mount options instead!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">How to undo double UTF-8 (or
other) encoded filenames <br>
Sometimes it might happen that you
&quot;double-encoded&quot; certain filenames, for example
the file names already were UTF-8 encoded and you accidently
did another conversion from some <br>
charset to UTF-8. You can simply undo that by converting
that the other way round. The from-charset has to be UTF-8
and the to-charset has to be the from-charset you previously
<br>
accidently used. If you use the &quot;--fixdouble&quot;
option convmv will make sure that only files will be
processed that will still be UTF-8 encoded after conversion
and it will leave <br>
non-UTF-8 files untouched. You should check to get the
correct results by doing the conversion without
&quot;--notest&quot; before, also the &quot;--qfrom&quot;
option might be helpful, because the <br>
double utf-8 file names might screw up your terminal if they
are being printed - they often contain control sequences
which do funny things with your terminal window. If you are
<br>
not sure about the charset which was accidently converted
from, using &quot;--qfrom&quot; is a good way to fiddle out
the required encoding without destroying the file names
finally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">How to repair Samba files <br>
When in the smb.conf (of Samba 2.x) there hasn&rsquo;t been
set a correct &quot;character set&quot; variable, files
which are created from Win* clients are being created in the
client&rsquo;s <br>
codepage, e.g. cp850 for western european languages. As a
result of that the files which contain non-ASCII characters
are screwed up if you &quot;ls&quot; them on the Unix
server. If you <br>
change the &quot;character set&quot; variable afterwards to
iso8859-1, newly created files are okay, but the old files
are still screwed up in the Windows encoding. In this case
convmv can <br>
also be used to convert the old Samba-shared files from
cp850 to iso8859-1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By the way: Samba 3.x finally
maps to UTF-8 filenames by default, so also when you migrate
from Samba 2 to Samba 3 you might have to convert your file
names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Netatalk interoperability issues
<br>
When Netatalk is being switched to UTF-8 which is supported
in version 2 then it is NOT sufficient to rename the file
names. There needs to be done more. See <br>

http://netatalk.sourceforge.net/2.0/htmldocs/upgrade.html#volumes-and-filenames
and the uniconv utility of Netatalk for details.</p>
