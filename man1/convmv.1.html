<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>convmv</b> is meant to help convert a single filename, a directory tree and
  the contained files or a whole filesystem into a different encoding. It just
  converts the filenames, not the content of the files. A special feature of
  convmv is that it also takes care of symlinks, also converts the symlink
  target pointer in case the symlink target is being converted, too.
<div class="Pp"></div>
All this comes in very handy when one wants to switch over from old 8-bit
  locales to UTF-8 locales. It is also possible to convert directories to UTF-8
  which are already partly UTF-8 encoded. convmv is able to detect if certain
  files are UTF-8 encoded and will skip them by default. To turn this smartness
  off use the &quot;--nosmart&quot; switch.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Filesystem_issues"><a class="selflink" href="#Filesystem_issues">Filesystem
  issues</a></h2>
Almost all POSIX filesystems do not care about how filenames are encoded, here
  are some exceptions:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>HFS+ on OS X / Darwin</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Linux and (most?) other Unix-like operating systems use the so called
  normalization form C (NFC) for its UTF-8 encoding by default but do not
  enforce this. Darwin, the base of the Macintosh OS enforces normalization form
  D (NFD), where a few characters are encoded in a different way. On OS X it's
  not possible to create NFC UTF-8 filenames because this is prevented at
  filesystem layer. On HFS+ filenames are internally stored in UTF-16 and when
  converted back to UTF-8, for the underlying BSD system to be handable, NFD is
  created. See http://developer.apple.com/qa/qa2001/qa1173.html for defails. I
  think it was a very bad idea and breaks many things under OS X which expect a
  normal POSIX conforming system. Anywhere else convmv is able to convert files
  from NFC to NFD or vice versa which makes interoperability with such systems a
  lot easier.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>JFS</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If people mount JFS partitions with iocharset=utf8, there is a similar problem,
  because JFS is designed to store filenames internally in UTF-16, too; that is
  because Linux' JFS is really JFS2, which was a rewrite of JFS for OS/2. JFS
  partitions should always be mounted with iocharset=iso8859-1, which is also
  the default with recent 2.6.6 kernels. If this is not done, JFS does not
  behave like a POSIX filesystem and it might happen that certain files cannot
  be created at all, for example filenames in ISO-8859-1 encoding. Only when
  interoperation with OS/2 is needed iocharset should be set according to your
  used locale charmap.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>NFS4</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Despite other POSIX filesystems RFC3530 (NFS 4) mandates UTF-8 but also says:
  &quot;The nfs4_cs_prep profile does not specify a normalization form. A later
  revision of this specification may specify a particular normalization
  form.&quot; In other words, if you want to use NFS4 you might find the
  conversion and normalization features of convmv quite useful.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>FAT/VFAT and NTFS</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
NTFS and VFAT (for long filenames) use UTF-16 internally to store filenames. You
  should not need to convert filenames if you mount one of those filesystems.
  Use appropriate mount options instead!
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="How_to_undo_double_UTF-8_(or_other)_encoded_filenames"><a class="selflink" href="#How_to_undo_double_UTF-8_(or_other)_encoded_filenames">How
  to undo double UTF-8 (or other) encoded filenames</a></h2>
Sometimes it might happen that you &quot;double-encoded&quot; certain filenames,
  for example the file names already were UTF-8 encoded and you accidently did
  another conversion from some charset to UTF-8. You can simply undo that by
  converting that the other way round. The from-charset has to be UTF-8 and the
  to-charset has to be the from-charset you previously accidently used. If you
  use the &quot;--fixdouble&quot; option convmv will make sure that only files
  will be processed that will still be UTF-8 encoded after conversion and it
  will leave non-UTF-8 files untouched. You should check to get the correct
  results by doing the conversion without &quot;--notest&quot; before, also the
  &quot;--qfrom&quot; option might be helpful, because the double utf-8 file
  names might screw up your terminal if they are being printed - they often
  contain control sequences which do funny things with your terminal window. If
  you are not sure about the charset which was accidently converted from, using
  &quot;--qfrom&quot; is a good way to fiddle out the required encoding without
  destroying the file names finally.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="How_to_repair_Samba_files"><a class="selflink" href="#How_to_repair_Samba_files">How
  to repair Samba files</a></h2>
When in the smb.conf (of Samba 2.x) there hasn't been set a correct
  &quot;character set&quot; variable, files which are created from Win* clients
  are being created in the client's codepage, e.g. cp850 for western european
  languages. As a result of that the files which contain non-ASCII characters
  are screwed up if you &quot;ls&quot; them on the Unix server. If you change
  the &quot;character set&quot; variable afterwards to iso8859-1, newly created
  files are okay, but the old files are still screwed up in the Windows
  encoding. In this case convmv can also be used to convert the old Samba-shared
  files from cp850 to iso8859-1.
<div class="Pp"></div>
By the way: Samba 3.x finally maps to UTF-8 filenames by default, so also when
  you migrate from Samba 2 to Samba 3 you might have to convert your file names.

  interoperability issues</a></h2>
When Netatalk is being switched to UTF-8 which is supported in version 2 then it
  is NOT sufficient to rename the file names. There needs to be done more. See
  http://netatalk.sourceforge.net/2.0/htmldocs/upgrade.html#volumes-and-filenames
  and the uniconv utility of Netatalk for details.
