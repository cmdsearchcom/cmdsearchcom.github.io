<p>ZSHBUILTINS(1) General Commands Manual
ZSHBUILTINS(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
zshbuiltins - zsh built-in commands</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS <br>
- simple command <br>
See the section &lsquo;Precommand Modifiers&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">. file [ arg ... ] <br>
Read commands from file and execute them in the current
shell environment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If file does not contain a
slash, or if PATH_DIRS is set, the shell looks in the
components of $path to find the directory containing file.
Files in the current directory <br>
are not read unless &lsquo;.&rsquo; appears somewhere in
$path. If a file named &lsquo;file.zwc&rsquo; is found, is
newer than file, and is the compiled form (created with the
zcompile builtin) <br>
of file, then commands are read from that file instead of
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If any arguments arg are given,
they become the positional parameters; the old positional
parameters are restored when the file is done executing. If
file was not found <br>
the return status is 127; if file was found but contained a
syntax error the return status is 126; else the return
status is the exit status of the last command executed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">: [ arg ... ] <br>
This command does nothing, although normal argument
expansions is performed which may have effects on shell
parameters. A zero exit status is returned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">alias [ {+|-}gmrsL ] [
name[=value] ... ] <br>
For each name with a corresponding value, define an alias
with that value. A trailing space in value causes the next
word to be checked for alias expansion. If the -g <br>
flag is present, define a global alias; global aliases are
expanded even if they do not occur in command position.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -s flags is present,
define a suffix alias: if the command word on a command line
is in the form &lsquo;text.name&rsquo;, where text is any
non-empty string, it is replaced by <br>
the text &lsquo;value text.name&rsquo;. Note that name is
treated as a literal string, not a pattern. A trailing space
in value is not special in this case. For example,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">alias -s ps=gv</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will cause the command
&lsquo;*.ps&rsquo; to be expanded to &lsquo;gv *.ps&rsquo;.
As alias expansion is carried out earlier than globbing, the
&lsquo;*.ps&rsquo; will then be expanded. Suffix aliases
con&acirc; <br>
stitute a different name space from other aliases (so in the
above example it is still possible to create an alias for
the command ps) and the two sets are never listed <br>
together.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For each name with no value,
print the value of name, if any. With no arguments, print
all currently defined aliases other than suffix aliases. If
the -m flag is given <br>
the arguments are taken as patterns (they should be quoted
to preserve them from being interpreted as glob patterns),
and the aliases matching these patterns are printed. <br>
When printing aliases and one of the -g, -r or -s flags is
present, restrict the printing to global, regular or suffix
aliases, respectively; a regular alias is one which <br>
is neither a global nor a suffix alias. Using
&lsquo;+&rsquo; instead of &lsquo;-&rsquo;, or ending the
option list with a single &lsquo;+&rsquo;, prevents the
values of the aliases from being printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -L flag is present, then
print each alias in a manner suitable for putting in a
startup script. The exit status is nonzero if a name (with
no value) is given for <br>
which no alias has been defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For more on aliases, include
common problems, see the section ALIASING in zshmisc(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">autoload [ {+|-}UXkmtz ] [ -w ]
[ name ... ] <br>
Equivalent to functions -u, with the exception of -X/+X and
-w.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The flag -X may be used only
inside a shell function, and may not be followed by a name.
It causes the calling function to be marked for autoloading
and then immediately <br>
loaded and executed, with the current array of positional
parameters as arguments. This replaces the previous
definition of the function. If no function definition is
<br>
found, an error is printed and the function remains
undefined and marked for autoloading.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The flag +X attempts to load
each name as an autoloaded function, but does not execute
it. The exit status is zero (success) if the function was
not previously defined <br>
and a definition for it was found. This does not replace any
existing definition of the function. The exit status is
nonzero (failure) if the function was already <br>
defined or when no definition was found. In the latter case
the function remains undefined and marked for autoloading.
If ksh-style autoloading is enabled, the function <br>
created will contain the contents of the file plus a call to
the function itself appended to it, thus giving normal ksh
autoloading behaviour on the first call to the <br>
function. If the -m flag is also given each name is treated
as a pattern and all functions already marked for autoload
that match the pattern are loaded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With the -w flag, the names are
taken as names of files compiled with the zcompile builtin,
and all functions defined in them are marked for
autoloading.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The flags -z and -k mark the
function to be autoloaded using the zsh or ksh style, as if
the option KSH_AUTOLOAD were unset or were set,
respectively. The flags override <br>
the setting of the option at the time the function is
loaded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the autoload command
makes no attempt to ensure the shell options set during the
loading or execution of the file have any particular value.
For this, the emu&acirc; <br>
late command can be used:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">emulate zsh -c &rsquo;autoload
-Uz func&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">arranges that when func is
loaded the shell is in native zsh emulation, and this
emulation is also applied when func is run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bg [ job ... ] <br>
job ... &amp; <br>
Put each specified job in the background, or the current job
if none is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bindkey <br>
See the section &lsquo;Zle Builtins&rsquo; in zshzle(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">break [ n ] <br>
Exit from an enclosing for, while, until, select or repeat
loop. If n is specified, then break n levels instead of just
one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">builtin name [ args ... ] <br>
Executes the builtin name, with the given args.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bye Same as exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cap See the section &lsquo;The
zsh/cap Module&rsquo; in zshmodules(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cd [ -qsLP ] [ arg ] <br>
cd [ -qsLP ] old new <br>
cd [ -qsLP ] {+|-}n <br>
Change the current directory. In the first form, change the
current directory to arg, or to the value of $HOME if arg is
not specified. If arg is &lsquo;-&rsquo;, change to the
pre&acirc; <br>
vious directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Otherwise, if arg begins with a
slash, attempt to change to the directory given by arg.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If arg does not begin with a
slash, the behaviour depends on whether the current
directory &lsquo;.&rsquo; occurs in the list of directories
contained in the shell parameter cdpath. <br>
If it does not, first attempt to change to the directory arg
under the current directory, and if that fails but cdpath is
set and contains at least one element attempt to <br>
change to the directory arg under each component of cdpath
in turn until successful. If &lsquo;.&rsquo; occurs in
cdpath, then cdpath is searched strictly in order so that
&lsquo;.&rsquo; is <br>
only tried at the appropriate point.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The order of testing cdpath is
modified if the option POSIX_CD is set, as described in the
documentation for the option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no directory is found, the
option CDABLE_VARS is set, and a parameter named arg exists
whose value begins with a slash, treat its value as the
directory. In that case, <br>
the parameter is added to the named directory hash
table.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The second form of cd
substitutes the string new for the string old in the name of
the current directory, and tries to change to this new
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The third form of cd extracts an
entry from the directory stack, and changes to that
directory. An argument of the form &lsquo;+n&rsquo;
identifies a stack entry by counting from the <br>
left of the list shown by the dirs command, starting with
zero. An argument of the form &lsquo;-n&rsquo; counts from
the right. If the PUSHD_MINUS option is set, the meanings of
&lsquo;+&rsquo; <br>
and &lsquo;-&rsquo; in this context are swapped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -q (quiet) option is
specified, the hook function chpwd and the functions in the
array chpwd_functions are not called. This is useful for
calls to cd that do not <br>
change the environment seen by an interactive user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -s option is specified,
cd refuses to change the current directory if the given
pathname contains symlinks. If the -P option is given or the
CHASE_LINKS option is <br>
set, symbolic links are resolved to their true values. If
the -L option is given symbolic links are retained in the
directory (and not resolved) regardless of the state <br>
of the CHASE_LINKS option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">chdir Same as cd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">clone See the section &lsquo;The
zsh/clone Module&rsquo; in zshmodules(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">command [ -pvV ] simple command
<br>
The simple command argument is taken as an external command
instead of a function or builtin and is executed. If the
POSIX_BUILTINS option is set, builtins will also be <br>
executed but certain special properties of them are
suppressed. The -p flag causes a default path to be searched
instead of that in $path. With the -v flag, command is <br>
similar to whence and with -V, it is equivalent to whence
-v.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See also the section
&lsquo;Precommand Modifiers&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">comparguments <br>
See the section &lsquo;The zsh/computil Module&rsquo; in
zshmodules(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">compcall <br>
See the section &lsquo;The zsh/compctl Module&rsquo; in
zshmodules(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">compctl <br>
See the section &lsquo;The zsh/compctl Module&rsquo; in

zshmodules(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">compvalues <br>
See the section &lsquo;The zsh/computil Module&rsquo; in
zshmodules(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">continue [ n ] <br>
Resume the next iteration of the enclosing for, while,
until, select or repeat loop. If n is specified, break out
of n-1 loops and resume at the nth enclosing loop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">declare <br>
Same as typeset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dirs [ -c ] [ arg ... ] <br>
dirs [ -lpv ] <br>
With no arguments, print the contents of the directory
stack. Directories are added to this stack with the pushd
command, and removed with the cd or popd commands. If <br>
arguments are specified, load them onto the directory stack,
replacing anything that was there, and push the current
directory onto the stack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c clear the directory
stack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l print directory names in full
instead of using of using ~ expressions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p print directory entries one
per line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v number the directories in the
stack when printing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">disable [ -afmrs ] name ... <br>
Temporarily disable the named hash table elements. The
default is to disable builtin commands. This allows you to
use an external command with the same name as a builtin <br>
command. The -a option causes disable to act on regular or
global aliases. The -s option causes disable to act on
suffix aliases. The -f option causes disable to act on <br>
shell functions. The -r options causes disable to act on
reserved words. Without arguments all disabled hash table
elements from the corresponding hash table are <br>
printed. With the -m flag the arguments are taken as
patterns (which should be quoted to prevent them from
undergoing filename expansion), and all hash table elements
<br>
from the corresponding hash table matching these patterns
are disabled. Disabled objects can be enabled with the
enable command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">disown [ job ... ] <br>
job ... &amp;| <br>
job ... &amp;! <br>
Remove the specified jobs from the job table; the shell will
no longer report their status, and will not complain if you
try to exit an interactive shell with them running <br>
or stopped. If no job is specified, disown the current
job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the jobs are currently
stopped and the AUTO_CONTINUE option is not set, a warning
is printed containing information about how to make them
running after they have been <br>
disowned. If one of the latter two forms is used, the jobs
will automatically be made running, independent of the
setting of the AUTO_CONTINUE option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">echo [ -neE ] [ arg ... ] <br>
Write each arg on the standard output, with a space
separating each one. If the -n flag is not present, print a
newline at the end. echo recognizes the following escape
<br>
sequences:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bell character <br>
backspace <br>
\ escape <br>
form feed <br>
linefeed (newline) <br>
carriage return <br>
horizontal tab <br>
vertical tab <br>
\ backslash <br>
NNN character code in octal <br>
character code in hexadecimal <br>
NNNN unicode character code in hexadecimal <br>
UNNNNNNNN <br>
unicode character code in hexadecimal</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -E flag, or the BSD_ECHO
option, can be used to disable these escape sequences. In
the latter case, -e flag can be used to enable them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">echotc See the section
&lsquo;The zsh/termcap Module&rsquo; in zshmodules(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">echoti See the section
&lsquo;The zsh/terminfo Module&rsquo; in zshmodules(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">emulate [ -LR ] [
{zsh|sh|ksh|csh} [ flags ... ] ] <br>
Without any argument print current emulation mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With single argument set up zsh
options to emulate the specified shell as much as possible.
csh will never be fully emulated. If the argument is not one
of the shells <br>
listed above, zsh will be used as a default; more precisely,
the tests performed on the argument are the same as those
used to determine the emulation at startup based on <br>
the shell name, see the section COMPATIBILITY in zsh(1)
.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the emulate command occurs
inside a function that has been marked for execution tracing
with functions -t then the xtrace option will be turned on
regardless of emula&acirc; <br>
tion mode or other options. Note that code executed inside
the function by the ., source, or eval commands is not
considered to be running directly from the function, <br>
hence does not provoke this behaviour.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -R switch is given, all
settable options are reset to their default value
corresponding to the specified emulation mode, except for
certain options describing the <br>
interactive environment; otherwise, only those options
likely to cause portability problems in scripts and
functions are altered. If the -L switch is given, the
options <br>
LOCAL_OPTIONS and LOCAL_TRAPS will be set as well, causing
the effects of the emulate command and any setopt and trap
commands to be local to the immediately surrounding <br>
shell function, if any; normally these options are turned
off in all emulation modes except ksh. The -L switch is
mutually exclusive with the use of -c in flags.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The flags may be any of the
invocation-time flags described in the section INVOCATION in
zsh(1), except that &lsquo;-o EMACS&rsquo; and &lsquo;-o
VI&rsquo; may not be used. Flags such as <br>
&lsquo;+r&rsquo;/&lsquo;+o RESTRICTED&rsquo; may be
prohibited in some circumstances.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If -c arg appears in flags, arg
is evaluated while the requested emulation is temporarily in
effect. In this case the emulation mode and all options are
restored to their <br>
previous values before emulate returns. The -R switch may
precede the name of the shell to emulate; note this has a
meaning distinct from including -R in flags.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use of -c enables
&lsquo;sticky&rsquo; emulation mode for functions defined
within the evaluated expression: the emulation mode is
associated thereafter with the function so that <br>
whenever the function is executed the emulation (respecting
the -R switch, if present) and all options are set before
entry to the function, and restored after exit. If <br>
the function is called when the sticky emulation is already
in effect, either within an &lsquo;emulate shell -c&rsquo;
expression or within another function with the same sticky
emu&acirc; <br>
lation, entry and exit from the function do not cause
options to be altered (except due to standard processing
such as the LOCAL_OPTIONS option). This also applies to <br>
functions marked for autoload within the sticky emulation;
the appropriate set of options will be applied at the point
the function is loaded as well as when it is run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">emulate sh -c &rsquo;fni() {
setopt cshnullglob; } <br>
fno() { fni; }&rsquo; <br>
fno</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The two functions fni and fno
are defined with sticky sh emulation. fno is then executed,
causing options associated with emulations to be set to
their values in sh. fni <br>
then calls fno; because fno is also marked for sticky sh
emulation, no option changes take place on entry to or exit
from it. Hence the option cshnullglob, turned off by <br>
sh emulation, will be turned on within fni and remain on on
return to fno. On exit from fno, the emulation mode and all
options will be restored to the state they were in <br>
before entry to the temporary emulation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The documentation above is
typically sufficient for the intended purpose of executing
code designed for other shells in a suitable environment.
More detailed rules fol&acirc; <br>
low. <br>
1. The sticky emulation environment provided by
&lsquo;emulate shell -c&rsquo; is identical to that provided
by entry to a function marked for sticky emulation as a
consequence of <br>
being defined in such an environment. Hence, for example,
the sticky emulation is inherited by subfunctions defined
within functions with sticky emulation. <br>
2. No change of options takes place on entry to or exit from
functions that are not marked for sticky emulation, other
than those that would normally take place, even <br>
if those functions are called within sticky emulation. <br>
3. No special handling is provided for functions marked for
autoload nor for functions present in wordcode created by
the zcompile command. <br>
4. The presence or absence of the -R switch to emulate
corresponds to different sticky emulation modes, so for
example &lsquo;emulate sh -c&rsquo;, &lsquo;emulate -R sh
-c&rsquo; and &lsquo;emulate <br>
csh -c&rsquo; are treated as three distinct sticky
emulations. <br>
5. Difference in shell options supplied in addition to the
basic emulation also mean the sticky emulations are
different, so for example &lsquo;emulate zsh -c&rsquo; and
&lsquo;emulate <br>
zsh -o cbases -c&rsquo; are treated as distinct sticky
emulations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">enable [ -afmrs ] name ... <br>
Enable the named hash table elements, presumably disabled
earlier with disable. The default is to enable builtin
commands. The -a option causes enable to act on regular <br>
or global aliases. The -s option causes enable to act on
suffix aliases. The -f option causes enable to act on shell
functions. The -r option causes enable to act on <br>
reserved words. Without arguments all enabled hash table
elements from the corresponding hash table are printed. With
the -m flag the arguments are taken as patterns <br>
(should be quoted) and all hash table elements from the
corresponding hash table matching these patterns are
enabled. Enabled objects can be disabled with the disable
<br>
builtin command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">eval [ arg ... ] <br>
Read the arguments as input to the shell and execute the
resulting command(s) in the current shell process. The
return status is the same as if the commands had been
exe&acirc; <br>
cuted directly by the shell; if there are no args or they
contain no commands (i.e. are an empty string or whitespace)
the return status is zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">exec [ -cl ] [ -a argv0 ] simple
command <br>
Replace the current shell with an external command rather
than forking. With -c clear the environment; with -l prepend
- to the argv[0] string of the command executed (to <br>
simulate a login shell); with -a argv0 set the argv[0]
string of the command executed. See the section
&lsquo;Precommand Modifiers&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">exit [ n ] <br>
Exit the shell with the exit status specified by n; if none
is specified, use the exit status from the last command
executed. An EOF condition will also cause the shell <br>
to exit, unless the IGNORE_EOF option is set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">export [ name[=value] ... ] <br>
The specified names are marked for automatic export to the
environment of subsequently executed commands. Equivalent to
typeset -gx. If a parameter specified does not <br>
already exist, it is created in the global scope.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">false [ arg ... ] <br>
Do nothing and return an exit status of 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fc [ -e ename ] [ -m match ] [
old=new ... ] [ first [ last ] ] <br>
fc -l [ -nrdfEiD ] [ -t timefmt ] [ -m match ] <br>
[ old=new ... ] [ first [ last ] ] <br>
fc -p [ -a ] [ filename [ histsize [ savehistsize ] ] ] <br>
fc -P <br>
fc -ARWI [ filename ] <br>
Select a range of commands from first to last from the
history list. The arguments first and last may be specified
as a number or as a string. A negative number is used <br>
as an offset to the current history event number. A string
specifies the most recent event beginning with the given
string. All substitutions old=new, if any, are then <br>
performed on the commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -l flag is given, the
resulting commands are listed on standard output. If the -m
flag is also given the first argument is taken as a pattern
(should be quoted) <br>
and only the history events matching this pattern will be
shown. Otherwise the editor program ename is invoked on a
file containing these history events. If ename is not <br>
given, the value of the parameter FCEDIT is used; if that is
not set the value of the parameter EDITOR is used; if that
is not set a builtin default, usually &lsquo;vi&rsquo; is
used. <br>
If ename is &lsquo;-&rsquo;, no editor is invoked. When
editing is complete, the edited command is executed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If first is not specified, it
will be set to -1 (the most recent event), or to -16 if the
-l flag is given. If last is not specified, it will be set
to first, or to -1 if <br>
the -l flag is given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The flag -r reverses the order
of the commands and the flag -n suppresses command numbers
when listing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also when listing, <br>
-d prints timestamps for each command <br>
-f prints full time-date stamps in the US &lsquo;MM/DD/YY
hh:mm&rsquo; format <br>
-E prints full time-date stamps in the European
&lsquo;dd.mm.yyyy hh:mm&rsquo; format <br>
-i prints full time-date stamps in ISO8601 &lsquo;yyyy-mm-dd
hh:mm&rsquo; format <br>
-t fmt prints time and date stamps in the given format; fmt
is formatted with the strftime function with the zsh
extensions described for the %D{string} prompt format in
<br>
the section EXPANSION OF PROMPT SEQUENCES in zshmisc(1). The
resulting formatted string must be no more than 256
characters or will not be printed. <br>
-D prints elapsed times; may be combined with one of the
options above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;fc -p&rsquo; pushes the
current history list onto a stack and switches to a new
history list. If the -a option is also specified, this
history list will be automatically <br>
popped when the current function scope is exited, which is a
much better solution than creating a trap function to call
&lsquo;fc -P&rsquo; manually. If no arguments are specified,
<br>
the history list is left empty, $HISTFILE is unset, and
$HISTSIZE &amp; $SAVEHIST are set to their default values.
If one argument is given, $HISTFILE is set to that
file&acirc; <br>
name, $HISTSIZE &amp; $SAVEHIST are left unchanged, and the
history file is read in (if it exists) to initialize the new
list. If a second argument is specified, $HISTSIZE &amp;
<br>
$SAVEHIST are instead set to the single specified numeric
value. Finally, if a third argument is specified, $SAVEHIST
is set to a separate value from $HISTSIZE. You are <br>
free to change these environment values for the new history
list however you desire in order to manipulate the new
history list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;fc -P&rsquo; pops the
history list back to an older list saved by &lsquo;fc
-p&rsquo;. The current list is saved to its $HISTFILE before
it is destroyed (assuming that $HISTFILE and <br>
$SAVEHIST are set appropriately, of course). The values of
$HISTFILE, $HISTSIZE, and $SAVEHIST are restored to the
values they had when &lsquo;fc -p&rsquo; was called. Note
that <br>
this restoration can conflict with making these variables
&quot;local&quot;, so your best bet is to avoid local
declarations for these variables in functions that use
&lsquo;fc -p&rsquo;. The <br>
one other guaranteed-safe combination is declaring these
variables to be local at the top of your function and using
the automatic option (-a) with &lsquo;fc -p&rsquo;. Finally,
note <br>
that it is legal to manually pop a push marked for automatic
popping if you need to do so before the function exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;fc -R&rsquo; reads the
history from the given file, &lsquo;fc -W&rsquo; writes the
history out to the given file, and &lsquo;fc -A&rsquo;
appends the history out to the given file. If no filename is
<br>
specified, the $HISTFILE is assumed. If the -I option is
added to -R, only those events that are not already
contained within the internal history list are added. If the
<br>
-I option is added to -A or -W, only those events that are
new since last incremental append/write to the history file
are appended/written. In any case, the created file <br>
will have no more than $SAVEHIST entries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fg [ job ... ] <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">float [ {+|-}EFHghlprtux ] [

Equivalent to typeset -f, with the exception of the -M
option. Use of the -M option may not be combined with any of
the options handled by typeset -f.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">functions -M mathfn defines
mathfn as the name of a mathematical function recognised in
all forms of arithmetical expressions; see the section
&lsquo;Arithmetic Evaluation&rsquo; in <br>
zshmisc(1). By default mathfn may take any number of
comma-separated arguments. If min is given, it must have
exactly min args; if min and max are both given, it must
<br>
have at least min and at most max args. max may be -1 to
indicate that there is no upper limit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default the function is
implemented by a shell function of the same name; if shellfn
is specified it gives the name of the corresponding shell
function while mathfn <br>
remains the name used in arithmetical expressions. The name
of the function in $0 is mathfn (not shellfn as would
usually be the case), provided the option FUNC&acirc; <br>
TION_ARGZERO is in effect. The positional parameters in the
shell function correspond to the arguments of the
mathematical function call. The result of the last
arith&acirc; <br>
metical expression evaluated inside the shell function (even
if it is a form that normally only returns a status) gives
the result of the mathematical function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">functions -M with no arguments
lists all such user-defined functions in the same form as a
definition. With the additional option -m and a list of
arguments, all func&acirc; <br>
tions whose mathfn matches one of the pattern arguments are
listed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">function +M removes the list of
mathematical functions; with the additional option -m the
arguments are treated as patterns and all functions whose
mathfn matches the pat&acirc; <br>

the behaviour is not removed (regardless of whether its name
coincides with mathfn).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, the following

<p style="margin-top: 1em">getln [ -AclneE ] name ... <br>
Read the top value from the buffer stack and put it in the
shell parameter name. Equivalent to read -zr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">getopts optstring name [ arg ...
] <br>
Checks the args for legal options. If the args are omitted,
use the positional parameters. A valid option argument
begins with a &lsquo;+&rsquo; or a &lsquo;-&rsquo;. An
argument not beginning <br>
with a &lsquo;+&rsquo; or a &lsquo;-&rsquo;, or the argument
&lsquo;--&rsquo;, ends the options. Note that a single
&lsquo;-&rsquo; is not considered a valid option argument.
optstring contains the letters that <br>
getopts recognizes. If a letter is followed by a
&lsquo;:&rsquo;, that option requires an argument. The
options can be separated from the argument by blanks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each time it is invoked, getopts
places the option letter it finds in the shell parameter
name, prepended with a &lsquo;+&rsquo; when arg begins with
a &lsquo;+&rsquo;. The index of the next arg <br>
is stored in OPTIND. The option argument, if any, is stored
in OPTARG.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first option to be examined
may be changed by explicitly assigning to OPTIND. OPTIND has
an initial value of 1, and is normally reset to 1 upon exit
from a shell <br>
function. OPTARG is not reset and retains its value from the
most recent call to getopts. If either of OPTIND or OPTARG
is explicitly unset, it remains unset, and the <br>
index or option argument is not stored. The option itself is
still stored in name in this case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A leading &lsquo;:&rsquo; in
optstring causes getopts to store the letter of any invalid
option in OPTARG, and to set name to &lsquo;?&rsquo; for an
unknown option and to &lsquo;:&rsquo; when a required <br>
argument is missing. Otherwise, getopts sets name to
&lsquo;?&rsquo; and prints an error message when an option
is invalid. The exit status is nonzero when there are no
more <br>
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hash [ -Ldfmrv ] [ name[=value]
] ... <br>
hash can be used to directly modify the contents of the
command hash table, and the named directory hash table.
Normally one would modify these tables by modifying
one&rsquo;s <br>
PATH (for the command hash table) or by creating appropriate
shell parameters (for the named directory hash table). The
choice of hash table to work on is determined by <br>
the -d option; without the option the command hash table is
used, and with the option the named directory hash table is
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Given no arguments, and neither
the -r or -f options, the selected hash table will be listed
in full.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -r option causes the
selected hash table to be emptied. It will be subsequently
rebuilt in the normal fashion. The -f option causes the
selected hash table to be <br>
fully rebuilt immediately. For the command hash table this
hashes all the absolute directories in the PATH, and for the
named directory hash table this adds all users&rsquo; <br>
home directories. These two options cannot be used with any
arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -m option causes the
arguments to be taken as patterns (which should be quoted)
and the elements of the hash table matching those patterns
are printed. This is the <br>
only way to display a limited selection of hash table
elements.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For each name with a
corresponding value, put &lsquo;name&rsquo; in the selected
hash table, associating it with the pathname
&lsquo;value&rsquo;. In the command hash table, this means
that <br>
whenever &lsquo;name&rsquo; is used as a command argument,
the shell will try to execute the file given by
&lsquo;value&rsquo;. In the named directory hash table, this
means that &lsquo;value&rsquo; may be <br>
referred to as &lsquo;~name&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For each name with no
corresponding value, attempt to add name to the hash table,
checking what the appropriate value is in the normal manner
for that hash table. If an <br>
appropriate value can&rsquo;t be found, then the hash table
will be unchanged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -v option causes hash table
entries to be listed as they are added by explicit
specification. If has no effect if used with -f.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -L flag is present, then
each hash table entry is printed in the form of a call to
hash.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">history <br>
Same as fc -l.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">integer [ {+|-}Hghilprtux ] [

Equivalent to typeset -i, except that options irrelevant to
integers are not permitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">jobs [ -dlprs ] [ job ... ] <br>
jobs -Z string <br>
Lists information about each given job, or all jobs if job
is omitted. The -l flag lists process IDs, and the -p flag
lists process groups. If the -r flag is specified <br>
only running jobs will be listed and if the -s flag is given
only stopped jobs are shown. If the -d flag is given, the
directory from which the job was started (which may <br>
not be the current directory of the job) will also be
shown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -Z option replaces the
shell&rsquo;s argument and environment space with the given
string, truncated if necessary to fit. This will normally be
visible in ps (ps(1)) list&acirc; <br>
ings. This feature is typically used by daemons, to indicate
their state.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kill [ -s signal_name | -n
signal_number | -sig ] job ... <br>
kill -l [ sig ... ] <br>
Sends either SIGTERM or the specified signal to the given
jobs or processes. Signals are given by number or by names,
with or without the &lsquo;SIG&rsquo; prefix. If the signal
<br>
being sent is not &lsquo;KILL&rsquo; or &lsquo;CONT&rsquo;,
then the job will be sent a &lsquo;CONT&rsquo; signal if it
is stopped. The argument job can be the process ID of a job
not in the job list. In <br>
the second form, kill -l, if sig is not specified the signal
names are listed. Otherwise, for each sig that is a name,
the corresponding signal number is listed. For <br>
each sig that is a signal number or a number representing
the exit status of a process which was terminated or stopped
by a signal the name of the signal is printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On some systems, alternative
signal names are allowed for a few signals. Typical examples
are SIGCHLD and SIGCLD or SIGPOLL and SIGIO, assuming they
correspond to the <br>
same signal number. kill -l will only list the preferred
form, however kill -l alt will show if the alternative form
corresponds to a signal number. For example, under <br>
Linux kill -l IO and kill -l POLL both output 29, hence kill
-IO and kill -POLL have the same effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Many systems will allow process
IDs to be negative to kill a process group or zero to kill
the current process group.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">let arg ... <br>
Evaluate each arg as an arithmetic expression. See the
section &lsquo;Arithmetic Evaluation&rsquo; in zshmisc(1)
for a description of arithmetic expressions. The exit status
is 0 if <br>
the value of the last expression is nonzero, 1 if it is
zero, and 2 if an error occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">limit [ -hs ] [ resource [ limit
] ] ... <br>
Set or display resource limits. Unless the -s flag is given,
the limit applies only the children of the shell. If -s is
given without other arguments, the resource lim&acirc; <br>
its of the current shell is set to the previously set
resource limits of the children.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If limit is not specified, print
the current limit placed on resource, otherwise set the
limit to the specified value. If the -h flag is given, use
hard limits instead of <br>
soft limits. If no resource is given, print all limits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When looping over multiple
resources, the shell will abort immediately if it detects a
badly formed argument. However, if it fails to set a limit
for some other reason it <br>
will continue trying to set the remaining limits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">resource can be one of:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">addressspace <br>
Maximum amount of address space used. <br>

Maximum amount of virtual memory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Which of these resource limits
are available depends on the system. resource can be
abbreviated to any unambiguous prefix. It can also be an
integer, which corresponds <br>
to the integer defined for the resource by the operating
system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If argument corresponds to a
number which is out of the range of the resources configured
into the shell, the shell will try to read or write the
limit anyway, and will <br>
report an error if this fails. As the shell does not store
such resources internally, an attempt to set the limit will
fail unless the -s option is present.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">limit is a number, with an
optional scaling factor, as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nh hours <br>
nk kilobytes (default) <br>
nm megabytes or minutes <br>
[mm:]ss <br>
minutes and seconds</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The limit command is not made

<p style="margin-top: 1em">popd [ [-q] {+|-}n ] <br>
Remove an entry from the directory stack, and perform a cd
to the new top directory. With no argument, the current top
entry is removed. An argument of the form &lsquo;+n&rsquo;
<br>
identifies a stack entry by counting from the left of the
list shown by the dirs command, starting with zero. An
argument of the form -n counts from the right. If the <br>
PUSHD_MINUS option is set, the meanings of &lsquo;+&rsquo;
and &lsquo;-&rsquo; in this context are swapped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -q (quiet) option is
specified, the hook function chpwd and the functions in the
array $chpwd_functions are not called, and the new directory

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print [ -abcDilmnNoOpPrsSz ] [

With the &lsquo;-f&rsquo; option the arguments are printed
as described by printf. With no flags or with the flag
&lsquo;-&rsquo;, the arguments are printed on the standard
output as described <br>
by echo, with the following differences: the escape sequence
&lsquo;x&rsquo; metafies the character x (sets the highest
bit), &lsquo;produces a control character (&lsquo;and
&lsquo; give the characters NUL and delete), and
&lsquo;&acute; is a synonym for &lsquo;\&rsquo;. Finally, if
not in an escape sequence, &lsquo;&acute; escapes the
following character and is not printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a Print arguments with the
column incrementing first. Only useful with the -c and -C
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b Recognize all the escape

the row incrementing first.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C cols <br>
Print the arguments in cols columns. Unless -a is also
given, arguments are printed with the row incrementing
first.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D Treat the arguments as
directory names, replacing prefixes with ~ expressions, as
appropriate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i If given together with -o or
-O, sorting is performed case-independently.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l Print the arguments separated
by newlines instead of spaces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m Take the first argument as a
pattern (should be quoted), and remove it from the argument
list together with subsequent arguments that do not match
this pattern.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Do not add a newline to the

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N Print the arguments separated
and terminated by nulls.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o Print the arguments sorted in
ascending order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O Print the arguments sorted in
descending order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p Print the arguments to the

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P Perform prompt expansion (see
EXPANSION OF PROMPT SEQUENCES in zshmisc(1)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Ignore the escape conventions
of echo.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R Emulate the BSD echo command,
which does not process escape sequences unless the -e flag
is given. The -n flag suppresses the trailing newline. Only
the -e and -n <br>
flags are recognized after -R; all other arguments and
options are printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Place the results in the
history list instead of on the standard output. Each
argument to the print command is treated as a single word in
the history, regardless <br>
of its content.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S Place the results in the
history list instead of on the standard output. In this case
only a single argument is allowed; it will be split into
words as if it were <br>
a full shell command line. The effect is similar to reading
the line from a history file with the HIST_LEX_WORDS option
active.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u n Print the arguments to file
descriptor n.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z Push the arguments onto the
editing buffer stack, separated by spaces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If any of &lsquo;-m&rsquo;,
&lsquo;-o&rsquo; or &lsquo;-O&rsquo; are used in combination
with &lsquo;-f&rsquo; and there are no arguments (after the
removal process in the case of &lsquo;-m&rsquo;) then
nothing is printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">printf format [ arg ... ] <br>
Print the arguments according to the format specification.
Formatting rules are the same as used in C. The same escape
sequences as for echo are recognised in the format. <br>
All C conversion specifications ending in one of
csdiouxXeEfgGn are handled. In addition to this,
&lsquo;%b&rsquo; can be used instead of &lsquo;%s&rsquo; to
cause escape sequences in the argu&acirc; <br>
ment to be recognised and &lsquo;%q&rsquo; can be used to
quote the argument in such a way that allows it to be reused
as shell input. With the numeric format specifiers, if the
cor&acirc; <br>
responding argument starts with a quote character, the
numeric value of the following character is used as the
number to print otherwise the argument is evaluated as an
<br>
arithmetic expression. See the section &lsquo;Arithmetic
Evaluation&rsquo; in zshmisc(1) for a description of
arithmetic expressions. With &lsquo;%n&rsquo;, the
corresponding argument is taken as <br>
an identifier which is created as an integer parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normally, conversion
specifications are applied to each argument in order but
they can explicitly specify the nth argument is to be used
by replacing &lsquo;%&rsquo; by &lsquo;%n$&rsquo; and
&lsquo;*&rsquo; <br>
by &lsquo;*n$&rsquo;. It is recommended that you do not mix
references of this explicit style with the normal style and
the handling of such mixed styles may be subject to future
<br>
change.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If arguments remain unused after
formatting, the format string is reused until all arguments
have been consumed. With the print builtin, this can be
suppressed by using <br>
the -r option. If more arguments are required by the format
than have been specified, the behaviour is as if zero or an
empty string had been specified as the argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pushd [ -qsLP ] [ arg ] <br>
pushd [ -qsLP ] old new <br>
pushd [ -qsLP ] {+|-}n <br>
Change the current directory, and push the old current
directory onto the directory stack. In the first form,
change the current directory to arg. If arg is not
speci&acirc; <br>
fied, change to the second directory on the stack (that is,
exchange the top two entries), or change to $HOME if the
PUSHD_TO_HOME option is set or if there is only one <br>
entry on the stack. Otherwise, arg is interpreted as it
would be by cd. The meaning of old and new in the second
form is also the same as for cd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The third form of pushd changes
directory by rotating the directory list. An argument of the
form &lsquo;+n&rsquo; identifies a stack entry by counting
from the left of the list <br>
shown by the dirs command, starting with zero. An argument
of the form &lsquo;-n&rsquo; counts from the right. If the
PUSHD_MINUS option is set, the meanings of &lsquo;+&rsquo;
and &lsquo;-&rsquo; in this <br>
context are swapped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -q (quiet) option is
specified, the hook function chpwd and the functions in the
array $chpwd_functions are not called, and the new directory
stack is not printed. <br>
This is useful for calls to pushd that do not change the
environment seen by an interactive user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the option -q is not
specified and the shell option PUSHD_SILENT is not set, the
directory stack will be printed after a pushd is
performed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The options -s, -L and -P have

terminal unless one of -u or -p is present. This option may
also be used within zle widgets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that despite the mnemonic
&lsquo;key&rsquo; this option does read full characters,
which may consist of multiple bytes if the option MULTIBYTE
is set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z Read one entry from the
editor buffer stack and assign it to the first name, without
word splitting. Text is pushed onto the stack with
&lsquo;print -z&rsquo; or with <br>
push-line from the line editor (see zshzle(1)). This flag is
ignored when the -k or -q flags are present.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e <br>
-E The input read is printed (echoed) to the standard
output. If the -e flag is used, no input is assigned to the
parameters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A The first name is taken as
the name of an array and all words are assigned to it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c <br>
-l These flags are allowed only if called inside a function
used for completion (specified with the -K flag to compctl).
If the -c flag is given, the words of the <br>
current command are read. If the -l flag is given, the whole
line is assigned as a scalar. If both flags are present, -l
is used and -c is ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Together with -c, the number
of the word the cursor is on is read. With -l, the index of
the character the cursor is on is read. Note that the
command name is <br>
word number 1, not word 0, and that when the cursor is at
the end of the line, its character index is the length of
the line plus one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u n Input is read from file
descriptor n.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p Input is read from the
coprocess.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d delim <br>
Input is terminated by the first character of delim instead
of by newline.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t [ num ] <br>
Test if input is available before attempting to read. If num
is present, it must begin with a digit and will be evaluated
to give a number of seconds, which may be <br>
a floating point number; in this case the read times out if
input is not available within this time. If num is not
present, it is taken to be zero, so that read <br>
returns immediately if no input is available. If no input is
available, return status 1 and do not set any variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is not available
when reading from the editor buffer with -z, when called
from within completion with -c or -l, with -q which clears
the input queue <br>
before reading, or within zle where other mechanisms should
be used to test for input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that read does not attempt
to alter the input processing mode. The default mode is
canonical input, in which an entire line is read at a time,
so usually <br>
&lsquo;read -t&rsquo; will not read anything until an entire
line has been typed. However, when reading from the terminal
with -k input is processed one key at a time; in this <br>
case, only availability of the first character is tested, so
that e.g. &lsquo;read -t -k 2&rsquo; can still block on the
second character. Use two instances of &lsquo;read -t
-k&rsquo; if <br>
this is not what is wanted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the first argument contains a
&lsquo;?&rsquo;, the remainder of this word is used as a
prompt on standard error when the shell is interactive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The value (exit status) of read
is 1 when an end-of-file is encountered, or when -c or -l is
present and the command is not called from a compctl
function, or as described <br>
for -q. Otherwise the value is 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The behavior of some
combinations of the -k, -p, -q, -u and -z flags is
undefined. Presently -q cancels all the others, -p cancels
-u, -k cancels -z, and otherwise -z <br>
cancels both -p and -u.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -c or -l flags cancel any
and all of -kpquz.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">readonly <br>
Same as typeset -r.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rehash Same as hash -r.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">return [ n ] <br>
Causes a shell function or &lsquo;.&rsquo; script to return
to the invoking script with the return status specified by
n. If n is omitted, the return status is that of the last
com&acirc; <br>
mand executed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If return was executed from a
trap in a TRAPNAL function, the effect is different for zero
and non-zero return status. With zero status (or after an
implicit return at <br>
the end of the trap), the shell will return to whatever it
was previously processing; with a non-zero status, the shell
will behave as interrupted except that the return <br>
status of the trap is retained. Note that the numeric value
of the signal which caused the trap is passed as the first
argument, so the statement &lsquo;return $((128+$1))&rsquo;
<br>
will return the same status as if the signal had not been
trapped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sched See the section &lsquo;The
zsh/sched Module&rsquo; in zshmodules(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set [ {+|-}options | {+|-}o [
option_name ] ] ... [ {+|-}A [ name ] ] [ arg ... ] <br>
Set the options for the shell and/or set the positional
parameters, or declare and set an array. If the -s option is
given, it causes the specified arguments to be sorted <br>
before assigning them to the positional parameters (or to
the array name if -A is used). With +s sort arguments in
descending order. For the meaning of the other flags, <br>
see zshoptions(1). Flags may be specified by name using the
-o option. If no option name is supplied with -o, the
current option states are printed: see the description <br>
of setopt below for more information on the format. With +o
they are printed in a form that can be used as input to the
shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -A flag is specified,
name is set to an array containing the given args; if no
name is specified, all arrays are printed together with
their values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If +A is used and name is an
array, the given arguments will replace the initial elements
of that array; if no name is specified, all arrays are
printed without their val&acirc; <br>
ues.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The behaviour of arguments after
-A name or +A name depends on whether the option KSH_ARRAYS
is set. If it is not set, all arguments following name are
treated as values <br>
for the array, regardless of their form. If the option is
set, normal option processing continues at that point; only
regular arguments are treated as values for the <br>
array. This means that</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set -A array -x -- foo</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sets array to &lsquo;-x --
foo&rsquo; if KSH_ARRAYS is not set, but sets the array to
foo and turns on the option &lsquo;-x&rsquo; if it is
set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -A flag is not present,
but there are arguments beyond the options, the positional
parameters are set. If the option list (if any) is
terminated by &lsquo;--&rsquo;, and there <br>
are no further arguments, the positional parameters will be
unset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no arguments and no
&lsquo;--&rsquo; are given, then the names and values of all
parameters are printed on the standard output. If the only
argument is &lsquo;+&rsquo;, the names of all <br>
parameters are printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For historical reasons,
&lsquo;set -&rsquo; is treated as &lsquo;set +xv&rsquo; and
&lsquo;set - args&rsquo; as &lsquo;set +xv -- args&rsquo;
when in any other emulation mode than zsh&rsquo;s native
mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">setcap See the section
&lsquo;The zsh/cap Module&rsquo; in zshmodules(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">setopt [ {+|-}options | {+|-}o
option_name ] [ name ... ] <br>
Set the options for the shell. All options specified either
with flags or by name are set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no arguments are supplied,
the names of all options currently set are printed. The form
is chosen so as to minimize the differences from the default
options for the <br>
current emulation (the default emulation being native zsh,
shown as &lt;Z&gt; in zshoptions(1)). Options that are on by
default for the emulation are shown with the prefix no <br>
only if they are off, while other options are shown without
the prefix no and only if they are on. In addition to
options changed from the default state by the user, any <br>
options activated automatically by the shell (for example,
SHIN_STDIN or INTERACTIVE) will be shown in the list. The
format is further modified by the option <br>
KSH_OPTION_PRINT, however the rationale for choosing options
with or without the no prefix remains the same in this
case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -m flag is given the
arguments are taken as patterns (which should be quoted to
protect them from filename expansion), and all options with
names matching these <br>
patterns are set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that a bad option name does
not cause execution of subsequent shell code to be aborted;
this is behaviour is different from that of &lsquo;set
-o&rsquo;. This is because set is <br>
regarded as a special builtin by the POSIX standard, but
setopt is not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">shift [ n ] [ name ... ] <br>
The positional parameters ${n+1} ... are renamed to $1 ...,
where n is an arithmetic expression that defaults to 1. If
any names are given then the arrays with these <br>
names are shifted instead of the positional parameters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">source file [ arg ... ] <br>
Same as &lsquo;.&rsquo;, except that the current directory
is always searched and is always searched first, before
directories in $path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">stat See the section &lsquo;The
zsh/stat Module&rsquo; in zshmodules(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">suspend [ -f ] <br>
Suspend the execution of the shell (send it a SIGTSTP) until
it receives a SIGCONT. Unless the -f option is given, this
will refuse to suspend a login shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">test [ arg ... ] <br>
[ [ arg ... ] ] <br>
Like the system version of test. Added for compatibility;
use conditional expressions instead (see the section
&lsquo;Conditional Expressions&rsquo;). The main differences
between <br>
the conditional expression syntax and the test and [
builtins are: these commands are not handled syntactically,
so for example an empty variable expansion may cause an <br>
argument to be omitted; syntax errors cause status 2 to be
returned instead of a shell error; and arithmetic operators
expect integer arguments rather than arithmetic <br>
expressions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The command attempts to
implement POSIX and its extensions where these are
specified. Unfortunately there are intrinsic ambiguities in
the syntax; in particular there is <br>
no distinction between test operators and strings that
resemble them. The standard attempts to resolve these for
small numbers of arguments (up to four); for five or more
<br>
arguments compatibility cannot be relied on. Users are urged
wherever possible to use the &lsquo;[[&rsquo; test syntax
which does not have these ambiguities.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">times Print the accumulated user
and system times for the shell and for processes run from
the shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">trap [ arg ] [ sig ... ] <br>
arg is a series of commands (usually quoted to protect it
from immediate evaluation by the shell) to be read and
executed when the shell receives any of the signals
speci&acirc; <br>
fied by one or more sig args. Each sig can be given as a
number, or as the name of a signal either with or without
the string SIG in front (e.g. 1, HUP, and SIGHUP are <br>
all the same signal).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If arg is &lsquo;-&rsquo;, then
the specified signals are reset to their defaults, or, if no
sig args are present, all traps are reset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If arg is an empty string, then
the specified signals are ignored by the shell (and by the
commands it invokes).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If arg is omitted but one or
more sig args are provided (i.e. the first argument is a
valid signal number or name), the effect is the same as if
arg had been specified as <br>
&lsquo;-&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The trap command with no
arguments prints a list of commands associated with each
signal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If sig is ZERR then arg will be
executed after each command with a nonzero exit status. ERR
is an alias for ZERR on systems that have no SIGERR signal
(this is the usual <br>
case).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If sig is DEBUG then arg will be
executed before each command if the option DEBUG_BEFORE_CMD
is set (as it is by default), else after each command. Here,
a &lsquo;command&rsquo; is <br>
what is described as a &lsquo;sublist&rsquo; in the shell
grammar, see the section SIMPLE COMMANDS &amp; PIPELINES in
zshmisc(1). If DEBUG_BEFORE_CMD is set various additional
features <br>
are available. First, it is possible to skip the next
command by setting the option ERR_EXIT; see the description
of the ERR_EXIT option in zshoptions(1). Also, the <br>
shell parameter ZSH_DEBUG_CMD is set to the string
corresponding to the command to be executed following the
trap. Note that this string is reconstructed from the
inter&acirc; <br>
nal format and may not be formatted the same way as the
original text. The parameter is unset after the trap is
executed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If sig is 0 or EXIT and the trap
statement is executed inside the body of a function, then
the command arg is executed after the function completes.
The value of $? at <br>
the start of execution is the exit status of the shell or
the return status of the function exiting. If sig is 0 or
EXIT and the trap statement is not executed inside the <br>
body of a function, then the command arg is executed when
the shell terminates; the trap runs before any zshexit hook
functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ZERR, DEBUG, and EXIT traps are
not executed inside other traps. ZERR and DEBUG traps are
kept within subshells, while other traps are reset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that traps defined with the
trap builtin are slightly different from those defined as
&lsquo;TRAPNAL () { ... }&rsquo;, as the latter have their
own function environment (line <br>
numbers, local variables, etc.) while the former use the
environment of the command in which they were called. For
example,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">trap &rsquo;print $LINENO&rsquo;
DEBUG</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will print the line number of a
command executed after it has run, while</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TRAPDEBUG() { print $LINENO;
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will always print the number
zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alternative signal names are
allowed as described under kill above. Defining a trap under
either name causes any trap under an alternative name to be
removed. However, <br>
it is recommended that for consistency users stick
exclusively to one name or another.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">true [ arg ... ] <br>
Do nothing and return an exit status of 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ttyctl -fu <br>
The -f option freezes the tty, and -u unfreezes it. When the
tty is frozen, no changes made to the tty settings by
external programs will be honored by the shell, except <br>
for changes in the size of the screen; the shell will simply
reset the settings to their previous values as soon as each
command exits or is suspended. Thus, stty and <br>
similar programs have no effect when the tty is frozen.
Without options it reports whether the terminal is frozen or
not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">type [ -wfpams ] name ... <br>
Equivalent to whence -v.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">typeset [
{+|-}AEFHUafghklprtuxmz ] [ -LRZi [ n ]] [ name[=value] ...
] <br>
typeset -T [ {+|-}Urux ] [ -LRZ [ n ]] SCALAR[=value] array
[ sep ] <br>
Set or display attributes and values for shell
parameters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A parameter is created for each
name that does not already refer to one. When inside a
function, a new parameter is created for every name (even
those that already <br>
exist), and is unset again when the function completes. See
&lsquo;Local Parameters&rsquo; in zshparam(1). The same
rules apply to special shell parameters, which retain their
spe&acirc; <br>
cial attributes when made local.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For each name=value assignment,
the parameter name is set to value. Note that arrays
currently cannot be assigned in typeset expressions, only
scalars and integers. <br>
Unless the option KSH_TYPESET is set, normal expansion rules
apply to assignment arguments, so value may be split into
separate words; if the option is set, assignments <br>
which can be recognised when expansion is performed are
treated as single words. For example the command typeset
vbl=$(echo one two) is treated as having one argument if
<br>
KSH_TYPESET is set, but otherwise is treated as having the
two arguments vbl=one and two.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the shell option
TYPESET_SILENT is not set, for each remaining name that
refers to a parameter that is set, the name and value of the
parameter are printed in the form <br>
of an assignment. Nothing is printed for newly-created
parameters, or when any attribute flags listed below are
given along with the name. Using &lsquo;+&rsquo; instead of
minus to <br>
introduce an attribute turns it off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -p option is given,
parameters and values are printed in the form of a typeset
command and an assignment (which will be printed separately
for arrays and associa&acirc; <br>
tive arrays), regardless of other flags and options. Note
that the -h flag on parameters is respected; no value will
be shown for these parameters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -T option is given, two
or three arguments must be present (an exception is that
zero arguments are allowed to show the list of parameters
created in this fashion). <br>
The first two are the name of a scalar and an array
parameter (in that order) that will be tied together in the
manner of $PATH and $path. The optional third argument is
<br>
a single-character separator which will be used to join the
elements of the array to form the scalar; if absent, a colon
is used, as with $PATH. Only the first character <br>
of the separator is significant; any remaining characters
are ignored. Only the scalar parameter may be assigned an
initial value. Both the scalar and the array may oth&acirc;
<br>
erwise be manipulated as normal. If one is unset, the other
will automatically be unset too. There is no way of untying
the variables without unsetting them, or convert&acirc; <br>
ing the type of one of them with another typeset command; +T
does not work, assigning an array to SCALAR is an error, and
assigning a scalar to array sets it to be a sin&acirc; <br>
gle-element array. Note that both &lsquo;typeset -xT
...&rsquo; and &lsquo;export -T ...&rsquo; work, but only
the scalar will be marked for export. Setting the value
using the scalar version <br>
causes a split on all separators (which cannot be quoted).
It is possible to use the same two tied variables with a
different separator character in which case the vari&acirc;
<br>
ables remain joined as before but the separator is changed.
This flag has a different meaning when used with -f; see
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -g (global) flag is treated
specially: it means that any resulting parameter will not be
restricted to local scope. Note that this does not
necessarily mean that the <br>
parameter will be global, as the flag will apply to any
existing parameter (even if unset) from an enclosing
function. This flag does not affect the parameter after
cre&acirc; <br>
ation, hence it has no effect when listing existing
parameters, nor does the flag +g have any effect except in
combination with -m (see below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no name is present, the names
and values of all parameters are printed. In this case the
attribute flags restrict the display to only those
parameters that have the <br>
specified attributes, and using &lsquo;+&rsquo; rather than
&lsquo;-&rsquo; to introduce the flag suppresses printing of
the values of parameters when there is no parameter name.
Also, if the <br>
last option is the word &lsquo;+&rsquo;, then names are
printed but values are not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -m flag is given the name
arguments are taken as patterns (which should be quoted).
With no attribute flags, all parameters (or functions with
the -f flag) with <br>
matching names are printed (the shell option TYPESET_SILENT
is not used in this case). Note that -m is ignored if no
patterns are given. If the +g flag is combined with <br>
-m, a new local parameter is created for every matching
parameter that is not already local. Otherwise -m applies
all other flags or assignments to the existing parame&acirc;
<br>
ters. Except when assignments are made with name=value,
using +m forces the matching parameters to be printed, even
inside a function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no attribute flags are given
and either no -m flag is present or the +m form was used,
each parameter name printed is preceded by a list of the
attributes of that <br>
parameter (array, association, exported, integer, readonly).
If +m is used with attribute flags, and all those flags are
introduced with +, the matching parameter names <br>
are printed but their values are not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Attribute flags that transform
the final value (-L, -R, -Z, -l, u) are only applied to the
expanded value at the point of a parameter expansion
expression using &lsquo;$&rsquo;. They <br>
are not applied when a parameter is retrieved internally by
the shell for any purpose.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following attribute flags
may be specified:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A The names refer to
associative array parameters; see &lsquo;Array
Parameters&rsquo; in zshparam(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L Left justify and remove
leading blanks from value. If n is nonzero, it defines the
width of the field. If n is zero, the width is determined by
the width of the <br>
value of the first assignment. In the case of numeric
parameters, the length of the complete value assigned to the
parameter is used to determine the width, not <br>
the value that would be output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The width is the count of
characters, which may be multibyte characters if the
MULTIBYTE option is in effect. Note that the screen width of
the character is not <br>
taken into account; if this is required, use padding with
parameter expansion flags ${(ml...)...} as described in
&lsquo;Parameter Expansion Flags&rsquo; in zshexpn(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the parameter is expanded,
it is filled on the right with blanks or truncated if
necessary to fit the field. Note truncation can lead to
unexpected results <br>
with numeric parameters. Leading zeros are removed if the -Z
flag is also set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R Similar to -L, except that
right justification is used; when the parameter is expanded,
the field is left filled with blanks or truncated from the
end. May not be <br>
combined with the -Z flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U For arrays (but not for
associative arrays), keep only the first occurrence of each
duplicated value. This may also be set for colon-separated
special parameters <br>
like PATH or FIGNORE, etc. This flag has a different meaning
when used with -f; see below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Z Specially handled if set
along with the -L flag. Otherwise, similar to -R, except
that leading zeros are used for padding instead of blanks if
the first non-blank <br>
character is a digit. Numeric parameters are specially
handled: they are always eligible for padding with zeroes,
and the zeroes are inserted at an appropriate <br>
place in the output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a The names refer to array
parameters. An array parameter may be created this way, but
it may not be assigned to in the typeset statement. When
displaying, both <br>
normal and associative arrays are shown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f The names refer to functions
rather than parameters. No assignments can be made, and the
only other valid flags are -t, -T, -k, -u, -U and -z. The
flag -t turns <br>
on execution tracing for this function; the flag -T does the
same, but turns off tracing on any function called from the
present one, unless that function also has <br>
the -t or -T flag. The -u and -U flags cause the function to
be marked for autoloading; -U also causes alias expansion to
be suppressed when the function is <br>
loaded. The fpath parameter will be searched to find the
function definition when the function is first referenced;
see the section &lsquo;Functions&rsquo;. The -k and -z <br>
flags make the function be loaded using ksh-style or
zsh-style autoloading respectively. If neither is given, the
setting of the KSH_AUTOLOAD option determines how <br>
the function is loaded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Hide: only useful for special
parameters (those marked &lsquo;&lt;S&gt;&rsquo; in the
table in zshparam(1)), and for local parameters with the
same name as a special parameter, <br>
though harmless for others. A special parameter with this
attribute will not retain its special effect when made
local. Thus after &lsquo;typeset -h PATH&rsquo;, a function
<br>
containing &lsquo;typeset PATH&rsquo; will create an
ordinary local parameter without the usual behaviour of
PATH. Alternatively, the local parameter may itself be given
this <br>
attribute; hence inside a function &lsquo;typeset -h
PATH&rsquo; creates an ordinary local parameter and the
special PATH parameter is not altered in any way. It is also
pos&acirc; <br>
sible to create a local parameter using &lsquo;typeset +h
special&rsquo;, where the local copy of special will retain
its special properties regardless of having the -h <br>
attribute. Global special parameters loaded from shell
modules (currently those in zsh/mapfile and zsh/parameter)
are automatically given the -h attribute to avoid <br>
name clashes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H Hide value: specifies that
typeset will not display the value of the parameter when
listing parameters; the display for such parameters is
always as if the &lsquo;+&rsquo; flag <br>
had been given. Use of the parameter is in other respects
normal, and the option does not apply if the parameter is
specified by name, or by pattern with the -m <br>
option. This is on by default for the parameters in the
zsh/parameter and zsh/mapfile modules. Note, however, that
unlike the -h flag this is also useful for <br>
non-special parameters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i Use an internal integer
representation. If n is nonzero it defines the output
arithmetic base, otherwise it is determined by the first
assignment. Bases from 2 to <br>
36 inclusive are allowed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E Use an internal
double-precision floating point representation. On output
the variable will be converted to scientific notation. If n

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ulimit [ [ -SHacdfilmnpqrstvx |

Set or display resource limits of the shell and the
processes started by the shell. The value of limit can be a
number in the unit specified below or one of the values <br>
&lsquo;unlimited&rsquo;, which removes the limit on the
resource, or &lsquo;hard&rsquo;, which uses the current
value of the hard limit on the resource.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, only soft limits are
manipulated. If the -H flag is given use hard limits instead
of soft limits. If the -S flag is given together with the -H

hard and soft limits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no options are used, the file
size limit (-f) is assumed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If limit is omitted the current
value of the specified resources are printed. When more than
one resource value is printed, the limit name and unit is
printed before each <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When looping over multiple
resources, the shell will abort immediately if it detects a
badly formed argument. However, if it fails to set a limit
for some other reason it <br>
will continue trying to set the remaining limits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Not all the following resources
are supported on all systems. Running ulimit -a will show
which are supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a Lists all of the current

-v Kilobytes on the size of virtual memory. On some systems
this refers to the limit called &lsquo;address space&rsquo;.
<br>
-x The number of locks on files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A resource may also be specified
by integer in the form &lsquo;-N resource&rsquo;, where
resource corresponds to the integer defined for the resource

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The number may alternatively be
out of the range of limits compiled into the shell. The
shell will try to read or write the limit anyway, and will
report an error if this <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">umask [ -S ] [ mask ] <br>
The umask is set to mask. mask can be either an octal number
or a symbolic value as described in chmod(1). If mask is
omitted, the current value is printed. The -S <br>
option causes the mask to be printed as a symbolic value.
Otherwise, the mask is printed as an octal number. Note that
in the symbolic form the permissions you specify <br>
are those which are to be allowed (not denied) to the users
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unalias <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unfunction <br>
Same as unhash -f.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unhash [ -adfms ] name ... <br>
Remove the element named name from an internal hash table.
The default is remove elements from the command hash table.
The -a option causes unhash to remove regular or <br>
global aliases; note when removing a global aliases that the
argument must be quoted to prevent it from being expanded
before being passed to the command. The -s option <br>
causes unhash to remove suffix aliases. The -f option causes
unhash to remove shell functions. The -d options causes
unhash to remove named directories. If the -m flag <br>
is given the arguments are taken as patterns (should be
quoted) and all elements of the corresponding hash table
with matching names will be removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unlimit [ -hs ] resource ...
<br>
The resource limit for each resource is set to the hard
limit. If the -h flag is given and the shell has appropriate
privileges, the hard resource limit for each resource <br>
is removed. The resources of the shell process are only
changed if the -s flag is given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The unlimit command is not made

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Individual elements of
associative array parameters may be unset by using subscript

Unset the options for the shell. All options specified
either with flags or by name are unset. If no arguments are
supplied, the names of all options currently unset are <br>
printed. If the -m flag is given the arguments are taken as
patterns (which should be quoted to preserve them from being
interpreted as glob patterns), and all options <br>

zcompile -ca [ -m ] [ -R | -M ] file [ name ... ] <br>
zcompile -t file [ name ... ] <br>
This builtin command can be used to compile functions or
scripts, storing the compiled form in a file, and to examine
files containing the compiled form. This allows <br>
faster autoloading of functions and execution of scripts by
avoiding parsing of the text when the files are read.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first form (without the -c,
-a or -t options) creates a compiled file. If only the file
argument is given, the output file has the name
&lsquo;file.zwc&rsquo; and will be placed <br>
in the same directory as the file. The shell will load the
compiled file instead of the normal function file when the
function is autoloaded; see the section &lsquo;Autoloading
<br>
Functions&rsquo; in zshmisc(1) for a description of how
autoloaded functions are searched. The extension .zwc stands
for &lsquo;zsh word code&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If there is at least one name
argument, all the named files are compiled into the output
file given as the first argument. If file does not end in
.zwc, this extension is <br>
automatically appended. Files containing multiple compiled
functions are called &lsquo;digest&rsquo; files, and are
intended to be used as elements of the FPATH/fpath special
array.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The second form, with the -c or
-a options, writes the compiled definitions for all the
named functions into file. For -c, the names must be
functions currently defined <br>
in the shell, not those marked for autoloading. Undefined
functions that are marked for autoloading may be written by
using the -a option, in which case the fpath is <br>
searched and the contents of the definition files for those
functions, if found, are compiled into file. If both -c and
-a are given, names of both defined functions and <br>
functions marked for autoloading may be given. In either
case, the functions in files written with the -c or -a
option will be autoloaded as if the KSH_AUTOLOAD option <br>
were unset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The reason for handling loaded
and not-yet-loaded functions with different options is that
some definition files for autoloading define multiple
functions, including the <br>
function with the same name as the file, and, at the end,
call that function. In such cases the output of
&lsquo;zcompile -c&rsquo; does not include the additional
functions defined <br>
in the file, and any other initialization code in the file
is lost. Using &lsquo;zcompile -a&rsquo; captures all this
extra information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -m option is combined
with -c or -a, the names are used as patterns and all
functions whose names match one of these patterns will be
written. If no name is given, <br>
the definitions of all functions currently defined or marked
as autoloaded will be written.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The third form, with the -t
option, examines an existing compiled file. Without further
arguments, the names of the original files compiled into it
are listed. The first <br>
line of output shows the version of the shell which compiled
the file and how the file will be used (i.e. by reading it
directly or by mapping it into memory). With argu&acirc;
<br>
ments, nothing is output and the return status is set to
zero if definitions for all names were found in the compiled
file, and non-zero if the definition for at least one <br>
name was not found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U Aliases are not expanded when
compiling the named files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R When the compiled file is
read, its contents are copied into the shell&rsquo;s memory,
rather than memory-mapped (see -M). This happens
automatically on systems that do <br>
not support memory mapping.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When compiling scripts instead
of autoloadable functions, it is often desirable to use this
option; otherwise the whole file, including the code to
define functions <br>
which have already been defined, will remain mapped,
consequently wasting memory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M The compiled file is mapped
into the shell&rsquo;s memory when read. This is done in
such a way that multiple instances of the shell running on
the same host will share <br>
this mapped file. If neither -R nor -M is given, the
zcompile builtin decides what to do based on the size of the
compiled file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k <br>
-z These options are used when the compiled file contains
functions which are to be autoloaded. If -z is given, the
function will be autoloaded as if the KSH_AUTOLOAD <br>
option is not set, even if it is set at the time the
compiled file is read, while if the -k is given, the
function will be loaded as if KSH_AUTOLOAD is set. These
<br>
options also take precedence over any -k or -z options
specified to the autoload builtin. If neither of these
options is given, the function will be loaded as <br>
determined by the setting of the KSH_AUTOLOAD option at the
time the compiled file is read.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These options may also appear as
many times as necessary between the listed names to specify
the loading style of all following functions, up to the next
-k or -z.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The created file always contains
two versions of the compiled format, one for big-endian
machines and one for small-endian machines. The upshot of
this is that the <br>
compiled file is machine independent and if it is read or
mapped, only one half of the file is actually used (and
mapped).</p>

Performs operations relating to zsh&rsquo;s loadable
modules. Loading of modules while the shell is running
(&lsquo;dynamical loading&rsquo;) is not available on all
operating systems, or <br>
on all installations on a particular operating system,
although the zmodload command itself is always available and
can be used to manipulate modules built into versions <br>
of the shell executable without dynamical loading.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Without arguments the names of
all currently loaded binary modules are printed. The -L
option causes this list to be in the form of a series of
zmodload commands. Forms <br>
with arguments are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zmodload [ -i ] name ... <br>
zmodload -u [ -i ] name ... <br>
In the simplest case, zmodload loads a binary module. The
module must be in a file with a name consisting of the
specified name followed by a standard suffix, usu&acirc;
<br>
ally &lsquo;.so&rsquo; (&lsquo;.sl&rsquo; on HPUX). If the
module to be loaded is already loaded the duplicate module
is ignored. If zmodload detects an inconsistency, such as an
invalid <br>
module name or circular dependency list, the current code
block is aborted. Hence &lsquo;zmodload module
2&gt;/dev/null&rsquo; is sufficient to test whether a module
is avail&acirc; <br>
able. If it is available, the module is loaded if necessary,
while if it is not available, non-zero status is silently
returned. The option -i is accepted for <br>
compatibility but has no effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The named module is searched for
in the same way a command is, using $module_path instead of
$path. However, the path search is performed even when the
module name <br>
contains a &lsquo;/&rsquo;, which it usually does. There is
no way to prevent the path search.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the module supports features
(see below), zmodload tries to enable all features when
loading a module. If the module was successfully loaded but
not all fea&acirc; <br>
tures could be enabled, zmodload returns status 2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With -u, zmodload unloads
modules. The same name must be given that was given when the
module was loaded, but it is not necessary for the module to
exist in the <br>
file system. The -i option suppresses the error if the
module is already unloaded (or was never loaded).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each module has a boot and a
cleanup function. The module will not be loaded if its boot
function fails. Similarly a module can only be unloaded if
its cleanup <br>
function runs successfully.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zmodload -F [ -almLe -P param ]
module [+-]feature... <br>
zmodload -F allows more selective control over the features
provided by modules. With no options apart from -F, the
module named module is loaded, if it was not <br>
already loaded, and the list of features is set to the
required state. If no features are specified, the module is
loaded, if it was not already loaded, but the <br>
state of features is unchanged. Each feature may be preceded
by a + to turn the feature on, or - to turn it off; the + is
assumed if neither character is present. <br>
Any feature not explicitly mentioned is left in its current
state; if the module was not previously loaded this means
any such features will remain disabled. The <br>
return status is zero if all features were set, 1 if the
module failed to load, and 2 if some features could not be
set (for example, a parameter couldn&rsquo;t be added <br>
because there was a different parameter of the same name)
but the module was loaded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The standard features are
builtins, conditions, parameters and math functions; these
are indicated by the prefix &lsquo;b:&rsquo;,
&lsquo;c:&rsquo; (&lsquo;C:&rsquo; for an infix condition),
&lsquo;p:&rsquo; and <br>
&lsquo;f:&rsquo;, respectively, followed by the name that
the corresponding feature would have in the shell. For
example, &lsquo;b:strftime&rsquo; indicates a builtin named
strftime and <br>
p:EPOCHSECONDS indicates a parameter named EPOCHSECONDS. The
module may provide other (&lsquo;abstract&rsquo;) features
of its own as indicated by its documentation; these <br>
have no prefix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With -l or -L, features provided
by the module are listed. With -l alone, a list of features
together with their states is shown, one feature per line.
With -L <br>
alone, a zmodload -F command that would cause enabled
features of the module to be turned on is shown. With -lL, a
zmodload -F command that would cause all the <br>
features to be set to their current state is shown. If one
of these combinations is given the option -P param then the
parameter param is set to an array of fea&acirc; <br>
tures, either features together with their state or (if -L
alone is given) enabled features.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With the option -L the module
name may be omitted; then a list of all enabled features for
all modules providing features is printed in the form of
zmodload -F com&acirc; <br>
mands. If -l is also given, the state of both enabled and
disabled features is output in that form.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A set of features may be
provided together with -l or -L and a module name; in that
case only the state of those features is considered. Each
feature may be pre&acirc; <br>
ceded by + or - but the character has no effect. If no set
of features is provided, all features are considered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With -e, the command first tests
that the module is loaded; if it is not, status 1 is
returned. If the module is loaded, the list of features
given as an argument <br>
is examined. Any feature given with no prefix is simply
tested to see if the module provides it; any feature given
with a prefix + or - is tested to see if is pro&acirc; <br>
vided and in the given state. If the tests on all features
in the list succeed, status 0 is returned, else status
1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With -m, each entry in the given
list of features is taken as a pattern to be matched against
the list of features provided by the module. An initial + or
- must <br>
be given explicitly. This may not be combined with the -a
option as autoloads must be specified explicitly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With -a, the given list of
features is marked for autoload from the specified module,
which may not yet be loaded. An optional + may appear before
the feature <br>
name. If the feature is prefixed with -, any existing
autoload is removed. The options -l and -L may be used to
list autoloads. Autoloading is specific to indi&acirc; <br>
vidual features; when the module is loaded only the
requested feature is enabled. Autoload requests are
preserved if the module is subsequently unloaded until an
<br>
explicit &lsquo;zmodload -Fa module -feature&rsquo; is
issued. It is not an error to request an autoload for a
feature of a module that is already loaded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the module is loaded each
autoload is checked against the features actually provided
by the module; if the feature is not provided the autoload
request is <br>
deleted. A warning message is output; if the module is being
loaded to provide a different feature, and that autoload is
successful, there is no effect on the sta&acirc; <br>
tus of the current command. If the module is already loaded
at the time when zmodload -Fa is run, an error message is
printed and status 1 returned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zmodload -Fa can be used with
the -l, -L, -e and -P options for listing and testing the
existence of autoloadable features. In this case -l is
ignored if -L is <br>
specified. zmodload -FaL with no module name lists autoloads
for all modules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that only standard features
as described above can be autoloaded; other features require
the module to be loaded before enabling.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zmodload -d [ -L ] [ name ] <br>
zmodload -d name dep ... <br>
zmodload -ud name [ dep ... ] <br>
The -d option can be used to specify module dependencies.
The modules named in the second and subsequent arguments
will be loaded before the module named in the <br>
first argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With -d and one argument, all
dependencies for that module are listed. With -d and no
arguments, all module dependencies are listed. This listing
is by default in <br>
a Makefile-like format. The -L option changes this format to
a list of zmodload -d commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If -d and -u are both used,
dependencies are removed. If only one argument is given, all
dependencies for that module are removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zmodload -ab [ -L ] <br>
zmodload -ab [ -i ] name [ builtin ... ] <br>
zmodload -ub [ -i ] builtin ... <br>
The -ab option defines autoloaded builtins. It defines the
specified builtins. When any of those builtins is called,
the module specified in the first argument is <br>
loaded and all its features are enabled (for selective
control of features use &lsquo;zmodload -F -a&rsquo; as
described above). If only the name is given, one builtin is
<br>
defined, with the same name as the module. -i suppresses the
error if the builtin is already defined or autoloaded, but
not if another builtin of the same name is <br>
already defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With -ab and no arguments, all
autoloaded builtins are listed, with the module name (if
different) shown in parentheses after the builtin name. The
-L option <br>
changes this format to a list of zmodload -a commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If -b is used together with the
-u option, it removes builtins previously defined with -ab.
This is only possible if the builtin is not yet loaded. -i
suppresses <br>
the error if the builtin is already removed (or never
existed).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Autoload requests are retained
if the module is subsequently unloaded until an explicit
&lsquo;zmodload -ub builtin&rsquo; is issued.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zmodload -ac [ -IL ] <br>
zmodload -ac [ -iI ] name [ cond ... ] <br>
zmodload -uc [ -iI ] cond ... <br>
The -ac option is used to define autoloaded condition codes.
The cond strings give the names of the conditions defined by
the module. The optional -I option is used <br>
to define infix condition names. Without this option prefix
condition names are defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If given no condition names, all
defined names are listed (as a series of zmodload commands
if the -L option is given).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -uc option removes

The -f option is like the -b, -p, and -c options, but makes
zmodload work on autoloaded math functions instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zmodload -a [ -L ] <br>
zmodload -a [ -i ] name [ builtin ... ] <br>
zmodload -ua [ -i ] builtin ... <br>
Equivalent to -ab and -ub.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zmodload -e [ -A ] [ string ...
] <br>
The -e option without arguments lists all loaded modules; if
the -A option is also given, module aliases corresponding to
loaded modules are also shown. If argu&acirc; <br>
ments are provided, nothing is printed; the return status is
set to zero if all strings given as arguments are names of
loaded modules and to one if at least on <br>
string is not the name of a loaded module. This can be used
to test for the availability of things implemented by
modules. In this case, any aliases are automati&acirc; <br>
cally resolved and the -A flag is not used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zmodload -A [ -L ] [
modalias[=module] ... ] <br>
For each argument, if both modalias and module are given,
define modalias to be an alias for the module module. If the
module modalias is ever subsequently <br>
requested, either via a call to zmodload or implicitly, the
shell will attempt to load module instead. If module is not
given, show the definition of modalias. If <br>
no arguments are given, list all defined module aliases.
When listing, if the -L flag was also given, list the
definition as a zmodload command to recreate the <br>
alias.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The existence of aliases for
modules is completely independent of whether the name
resolved is actually loaded as a module: while the alias
exists, loading and <br>
unloading the module under any alias has exactly the same
effect as using the resolved name, and does not affect the
connection between the alias and the resolved <br>
name which can be removed either by zmodload -R or by
redefining the alias. Chains of aliases (i.e. where the
first resolved name is itself an alias) are valid so <br>
long as these are not circular. As the aliases take the same
format as module names, they may include path separators: in
this case, there is no requirement for <br>
any part of the path named to exist as the alias will be
resolved first. For example, &lsquo;any/old/alias&rsquo; is
always a valid alias.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Dependencies added to aliased
modules are actually added to the resolved module; these
remain if the alias is removed. It is valid to create an
alias whose name is <br>
one of the standard shell modules and which resolves to a
different module. However, if a module has dependencies, it
will not be possible to use the module name <br>
as an alias as the module will already be marked as a
loadable module in its own right.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Apart from the above, aliases
can be used in the zmodload command anywhere module names
are required. However, aliases will not be shown in lists of
loaded modules <br>
with a bare &lsquo;zmodload&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zmodload -R modalias ... <br>
For each modalias argument that was previously defined as a
module alias via zmodload -A, delete the alias. If any was
not defined, an error is caused and the <br>
remainder of the line is ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that zsh makes no
distinction between modules that were linked into the shell
and modules that are loaded dynamically. In both cases this
builtin command has to be <br>
used to make available the builtins and other things defined
by modules (unless the module is autoloaded on these
definitions). This is true even for systems that don&rsquo;t
<br>
support dynamic loading of modules.</p>
