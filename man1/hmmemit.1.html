<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
hmmemit - sample sequences from a profile HMM</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
hmmemit [options] hmmfile</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The hmmemit program samples (emits) sequences from the
profile HMM(s) in hmmfile, and writes them to output.
Sampling sequences may be useful for a variety of purposes,
includ&acirc; <br>
ing creating synthetic true positives for benchmarks or
tests.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is to sample one
unaligned sequence from the core probability model, which
means that each sequence consists of one full-length domain.
Alternatively, with the -c <br>
option, you can emit a simple majority-rule consensus
sequence; or with the -a option, you can emit an alignment
(in which case, you probably also want to set -N to
something <br>
other than its default of 1 sequence per model).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As another option, with the -p
option you can sample a sequence from a fully configured
HMMER search profile. This means sampling a
&lsquo;homologous sequence&rsquo; by HMMER&rsquo;s
definition, <br>
including nonhomologous flanking sequences, local
alignments, and multiple domains per sequence, depending on
the length model and alignment mode chosen for the
profile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The hmmfile may contain a
library of HMMs, in which case each HMM will be used in
turn.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;hmmfile&gt; may be
&rsquo;-&rsquo; (dash), which means reading this input from
stdin rather than a file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMON OPTIONS <br>
-h Help; print a brief reminder of command line usage and
all available options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o &lt;f&gt; Direct the output
sequences to file &lt;f&gt;, rather than to stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N &lt;n&gt; Sample &lt;n&gt;
sequences per model, rather than just one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS CONTROLLING WHAT TO EMIT
<br>
The default is to sample N sequences from the core model.
Alternatively, you may choose one (and only one) of the
following alternatives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a Emit an alignment for each
HMM in the hmmfile rather than sampling unaligned sequences
one at a time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Emit a plurality-rule
consensus sequence, instead of sampling a sequence from the
profile HMM&rsquo;s probability distribution. The consensus
sequence is formed by selecting the <br>
maximum probability residue at each match state.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C Emit a fancier plurality-rule
consensus sequence than the -c option. If the maximum
probability residue has p &lt; minl show it as a lower case
&rsquo;any&rsquo; residue (n or x); if p <br>
&gt;= minl and &lt; minu show it as a lower case residue;
and if p &gt;= minu show it as an upper case residue. The
default settings of minu and minl are both 0.0, which means
-C <br>
gives the same output as -c unless you also set minu and
minl to what you want.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p Sample unaligned sequences
from the implicit search profile, not from the core model.
The core model consists only of the homologous states
(between the begin and end <br>
states of a HMMER Plan7 model). The profile includes the
nonhomologous N, C, and J states, local/glocal and
uni/multihit algorithm configuration, and the target length
<br>
model. Therefore sequences sampled from a profile may
include nonhomologous as well as homologous sequences, and
may contain more than one homologous sequence segment. By
<br>
default, the profile is in multihit local mode, and the
target sequence length is configured for L=400.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS CONTROLLING EMISSION
FROM PROFILES <br>
These options require that you have set the -p option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L &lt;n&gt; Configure the
profile&rsquo;s target sequence length model to generate a
mean length of approximately &lt;n&gt; rather than the
default of 400.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--local <br>
Configure the profile for multihit local alignment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--unilocal <br>
Configure the profile for unihit local alignment
(Smith/Waterman).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--glocal <br>
Configure the profile for multihit glocal alignment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--uniglocal <br>
Configure the profile for unihit glocal alignment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS CONTROLLING FANCY
CONSENSUS EMISSION <br>
These options require that you have set the -C option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--minl &lt;x&gt; <br>
Sets the minl threshold for showing weakly conserved
residues as lower case. (0 &lt;= x &lt;= 1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--minu &lt;x&gt; <br>
Sets the minu threshold for showing strongly conserved
residues as upper case. (0 &lt;= x &lt;= 1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OTHER OPTIONS <br>
--seed &lt;n&gt; <br>
Seed the random number generator with &lt;n&gt;, an integer
&gt;= 0. If &lt;n&gt; is nonzero, any stochastic simulations
will be reproducible; the same command will give the same
<br>
results. If &lt;n&gt; is 0, the random number generator is
seeded arbitrarily, and stochastic simulations will vary
from run to run of the same command. The default is 0: use
<br>
an arbitrary seed, so different hmmemit runs will generate
different samples.</p>
