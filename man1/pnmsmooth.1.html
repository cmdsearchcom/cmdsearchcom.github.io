<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pnmsmooth - smooth out an image</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pnmsmooth [-width=cols] [-height=rows] [pnmfile] [-size]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Minimum unique abbreviations of
options is acceptable. You may use double hyphens instead of
single hyphen to denote options. You may use white space in
place of the equals <br>
sign to separate an option name from its value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This program is part of Netpbm(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pnmsmooth smoothes out an image
by replacing each pixel with the average of its width X
height neighbors. It is implemented as a progam that invokes
pnmconvol with an appropri&acirc; <br>
ate convolution matrix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-width=cols</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-height=rows <br>
These options specify the dimensions of the convolution
matrix. Default dimensions are 3 wide and 3 high.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Before Netpbm 10.49 (December
2009), the maximum size of the convolution matrix is limited
by the maxval of the image such that width * height * 2 must
not exceed the max&acirc; <br>
val. (use pamdepth to increase the maxval if necessary).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These options were new in Netpbm
10.32 (February 2006). Before that, use -size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-size This deprecated option
exists in current Netpbm for backward compatibility. It was
obsoleted by -width and -height in Netpbm 10.32 (February
2006).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When you use this option, the
first two program arguments are the width and height,
respectively, of the convolution matrix and do the same
thing as the -width and -height <br>
option values. The third (optional) program argument is the
input file name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In reality, in old pnmsmooth,
the width and height are two values of the -size option, but
the modern Netpbm command syntax paradigm doesn&rsquo;t
allow an option with multiple <br>
values, so instead -size is an option with no value and
width and height are program arguments. That has the
fortunate effect of making the following command mean the
<br>
same in current pnmsmooth as in old pnmsmooth: <br>
pnmsmooth -size 5 5 infile.ppm &gt;outfile.ppm</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dump=dumpfile <br>
This options makes pnmsmooth only show you the convolution
matrix. It writes to Standard Output a pnmconvol -matrix
option value that represents the matrix. It does not <br>
invoke pnmconvol and does not produce an output image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Before Neptbm 10.49 (December
2009), this option is rather different. It takes a file name
as a value, and it writes to that file the convolution
matrix as a PGM file (as <br>
used to be the normal input for pnmconvol).</p>

pnmconvol(1) , pnm(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY <br>
Before Netpbm 10.32 (February 2006), pnmsmooth did not use
the modern Netpbm command line parser, so had an
unconventional command line syntax. Most importantly, you
could not <br>
use an equal sign or double hyphens in the options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Before Netpbm 10.49 (December
2009), there was a -dump option. This strange option caused
pnmsmooth not to do any smoothing or produce any output
image but instead write the <br>
convolution matrix it would have used, as PGM file such as
pnmconvol used to use, to a file you specify. The idea was
you could then use that file with a separate invocation of
<br>
pnmconvol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Then, in Netpbm 10.49, there was
a rather different -dump option with a similar purpose: It
caused pnmsmooth to write to Standard Error a string
suitable as a value for the pnm&acirc; <br>
convol -matrix option (an option that was new in Netpbm
10.49).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">But in Netpbm 10.51 (June 2010),
pnmconvol started using the even newer pnmconvol -normalize
option (new in 10.50), which made specifying the convolution
matrix for the kind of <br>
smoothing that pnmsmooth does trivial, so -dump disappeared
from pnmsmooth.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(There were also ease of
implementation issues that kept us from simply keeping the
original -dump around for backward compatibility: As we
modified pnmsmooth to take advantage <br>
of the new features of pnmconvol, which pnmsmooth uses
internally, the information needed to implement -dump was no
longer available in the program).</p>
