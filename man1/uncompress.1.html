<i>Compress</i> reduces the size of the named files using adaptive Lempel-Ziv
  coding. Whenever possible, each file is replaced by one with the extension
  <b>.Z,</b> while keeping the same ownership modes, access and modification
  times. If no files are specified, the standard input is compressed to the
  standard output. <i>Compress</i> will only attempt to compress regular files.
  In particular, it will ignore symbolic links. If a file has multiple hard
  links, <i>compress</i> will refuse to compress it unless the <b>-f</b> flag is
  given.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If <b>-f</b> is not given and <i>compress</i> is run in the foreground, the user
  is prompted as to whether an existing file should be overwritten.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Compressed files can be restored to their original form using <i>uncompress</i>
  or <i>zcat.</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>uncompress</i> takes a list of files on its command line and replaces each
  file whose name ends with <b>.Z</b> and which begins with the correct magic
  number with an uncompressed file without the <b>.Z.</b> The uncompressed file
  will have the mode, ownership and timestamps of the compressed file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-c</b> option makes <i>compress/uncompress</i> write to the standard
  output; no files are changed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>zcat</i> is identical to <i>uncompress</i> <b>-c.</b> <i>zcat</i>
  uncompresses either a list of files on the command line or its standard input
  and writes the uncompressed data on standard output. <i>zcat</i> will
  uncompress files that have the correct magic number whether they have a
  <b>.Z</b> suffix or not.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the <b>-r</b> flag is specified, <i>compress</i> will operate recursively. If
  any of the file names specified on the command line are directories,
  <i>compress</i> will descend into the directory and compress all the files it
  finds there.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-V</b> flag tells each of these programs to print its version and
  patchlevel, along with any preprocessor flags specified during compilation, on
  stderr before doing any compression or uncompression.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Compress</i> uses the modified Lempel-Ziv algorithm popularized in &quot;A
  Technique for High Performance Data Compression&quot;, Terry A. Welch, <i>IEEE
  Computer,</i> vol. 17, no. 6 (June 1984), pp. 8-19. Common substrings in the
  file are first replaced by 9-bit codes 257 and up. When code 512 is reached,
  the algorithm switches to 10-bit codes and continues to use more bits until
  the limit specified by the <b>-b</b> flag is reached (default 16). <i>Bits</i>
  must be between 9 and 16. The default can be changed in the source to allow
  <i>compress</i> to be run on a smaller machine.
<div class="Pp"></div>
After the <i>bits</i> limit is attained, <i>compress</i> periodically checks the
  compression ratio. If it is increasing, <i>compress</i> continues to use the
  existing code dictionary. However, if the compression ratio decreases,
  <i>compress</i> discards the table of substrings and rebuilds it from scratch.
  This allows the algorithm to adapt to the next &quot;block&quot; of the file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that the <b>-b</b> flag is omitted for <i>uncompress,</i> since the
  <i>bits</i> parameter specified during compression is encoded within the
  output, along with a magic number to ensure that neither decompression of
  random data nor recompression of compressed data is attempted.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The amount of compression obtained depends on the size of the input, the number
  of <i>bits</i> per code, and the distribution of common substrings. Typically,
  text such as source code or English is reduced by 50-60%. Compression is
  generally much better than that achieved by Huffman coding (as used in
  <i>pack</i>), or adaptive Huffman coding (<i>compact</i>), and takes less time
  to compute.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Under the <b>-v</b> option, a message is printed yielding the percentage of
  reduction for each file compressed.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DIAGNOSTICS"><a class="selflink" href="#DIAGNOSTICS">DIAGNOSTICS</a></h1>
Exit status is normally 0; if the last file is larger after (attempted)
  compression, the status is 2; if an error occurs, exit status is 1.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Usage: compress [-dfvcVr] [-b maxbits] [file ...]
<br/>
Invalid options were specified on the command line.
<br/>
Missing maxbits
<br/>
Maxbits must follow <b>-b</b>.
<br/>
<i>file</i>: not in compressed format
<br/>
The file specified to <i>uncompress</i> has not been compressed.
<br/>
<i>file</i>: compressed with <i>xx</i> bits, can only handle <i>yy</i> bits
<br/>
<i>File</i> was compressed by a program that could deal with more <i>bits</i>
  than the compress code on this machine. Recompress the file with smaller
  <i>bits</i>.
<br/>
<i>file</i>: already has .Z suffix -- no change
<br/>
The file is assumed to be already compressed. Rename the file and try again.
<br/>
<i>file</i>: filename too long to tack on .Z
<br/>
The file cannot be compressed because its name is longer than 12 characters.
  Rename and try again. This message does not occur on BSD systems.
<br/>
<i>file</i> already exists; do you wish to overwrite (y or n)?
<br/>
Respond &quot;y&quot; if you want the output file to be replaced; &quot;n&quot;
  if not.
<br/>
uncompress: corrupt input
<br/>
A SIGSEGV violation was detected which usually means that the input file has
  been corrupted.
<br/>
Compression: <i>xx.xx%</i>
<br/>
Percentage of the input saved by compression. (Relevant only for <b>-v</b>.)
<br/>
-- not a regular file or directory: ignored
<br/>
When the input file is not a regular file or directory, (e.g. a symbolic link,
  socket, FIFO, device file), it is left unaltered.
<br/>
-- has <i>xx</i> other links: unchanged
<br/>
The input file has links; it is left unchanged. See <i>ln</i>(1) for more
  information. Use the <b>-f</b> flag to force compression of multiply-linked
  files.
<br/>
-- file unchanged
<br/>
No savings is achieved by compression. The input remains virgin.
<br/>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="BUGS"><a class="selflink" href="#BUGS">BUGS</a></h1>
Although compressed files are compatible between machines with large memory,
  <b>-b</b>12 should be used for file transfer to architectures with a small
  process data space (64KB or less, as exhibited by the DEC PDP series, the
  Intel 80286, etc.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
Invoking compress with a <b>-r</b> flag will occasionally cause it to produce
  spurious error warnings of the form
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
&quot;&lt;filename&gt;.Z already has .Z suffix - ignored&quot;
<br/>
<div class="Pp"></div>
These warnings can be ignored. See the comments in compress42.c:compdir() in the
  source distribution for an explanation.
