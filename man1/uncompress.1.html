<p>COMPRESS(1) General Commands Manual COMPRESS(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
compress, uncompress, zcat - compress and expand data</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
compress [ -f ] [ -v ] [ -c ] [ -V ] [ -r ] [ -b bits ] [
name ... ] <br>
uncompress [ -f ] [ -v ] [ -c ] [ -V ] [ name ... ] <br>
zcat [ -V ] [ name ... ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Compress reduces the size of the named files using adaptive
Lempel-Ziv coding. Whenever possible, each file is replaced
by one with the extension .Z, while keeping the same
own&acirc; <br>
ership modes, access and modification times. If no files are
specified, the standard input is compressed to the standard
output. Compress will only attempt to compress regular <br>
files. In particular, it will ignore symbolic links. If a
file has multiple hard links, compress will refuse to
compress it unless the -f flag is given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If -f is not given and compress
is run in the foreground, the user is prompted as to whether
an existing file should be overwritten.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Compressed files can be restored
to their original form using uncompress or zcat.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">uncompress takes a list of files
on its command line and replaces each file whose name ends
with .Z and which begins with the correct magic number with
an uncompressed file with&acirc; <br>
out the .Z. The uncompressed file will have the mode,
ownership and timestamps of the compressed file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -c option makes
compress/uncompress write to the standard output; no files
are changed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zcat is identical to uncompress
-c. zcat uncompresses either a list of files on the command
line or its standard input and writes the uncompressed data
on standard output. zcat <br>
will uncompress files that have the correct magic number
whether they have a .Z suffix or not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -r flag is specified,
compress will operate recursively. If any of the file names
specified on the command line are directories, compress will
descend into the directory <br>
and compress all the files it finds there.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -V flag tells each of these
programs to print its version and patchlevel, along with any
preprocessor flags specified during compilation, on stderr
before doing any compres&acirc; <br>
sion or uncompression.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Compress uses the modified
Lempel-Ziv algorithm popularized in &quot;A Technique for
High Performance Data Compression&quot;, Terry A. Welch,
IEEE Computer, vol. 17, no. 6 (June 1984), pp. <br>
8-19. Common substrings in the file are first replaced by
9-bit codes 257 and up. When code 512 is reached, the
algorithm switches to 10-bit codes and continues to use more
<br>
bits until the limit specified by the -b flag is reached
(default 16). Bits must be between 9 and 16. The default can
be changed in the source to allow compress to be run on a
<br>
smaller machine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After the bits limit is
attained, compress periodically checks the compression
ratio. If it is increasing, compress continues to use the
existing code dictionary. However, if <br>
the compression ratio decreases, compress discards the table
of substrings and rebuilds it from scratch. This allows the
algorithm to adapt to the next &quot;block&quot; of the
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the -b flag is omitted
for uncompress, since the bits parameter specified during
compression is encoded within the output, along with a magic
number to ensure that nei&acirc; <br>
ther decompression of random data nor recompression of
compressed data is attempted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The amount of compression
obtained depends on the size of the input, the number of
bits per code, and the distribution of common substrings.
Typically, text such as source code <br>
or English is reduced by 50-60%. Compression is generally
much better than that achieved by Huffman coding (as used in
pack), or adaptive Huffman coding (compact), and takes <br>
less time to compute.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Under the -v option, a message
is printed yielding the percentage of reduction for each
file compressed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
Exit status is normally 0; if the last file is larger after
(attempted) compression, the status is 2; if an error
occurs, exit status is 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Usage: compress [-dfvcVr] [-b
maxbits] [file ...] <br>
Invalid options were specified on the command line. <br>
Missing maxbits <br>
Maxbits must follow -b. <br>
file: not in compressed format <br>
The file specified to uncompress has not been compressed.
<br>
file: compressed with xx bits, can only handle yy bits <br>
File was compressed by a program that could deal with more
bits than the compress code on this machine. Recompress the
file with smaller bits. <br>
file: already has .Z suffix -- no change <br>
The file is assumed to be already compressed. Rename the
file and try again. <br>
file: filename too long to tack on .Z <br>
The file cannot be compressed because its name is longer
than 12 characters. Rename and try again. This message does
not occur on BSD systems. <br>
file already exists; do you wish to overwrite (y or n)? <br>
Respond &quot;y&quot; if you want the output file to be
replaced; &quot;n&quot; if not. <br>
uncompress: corrupt input <br>
A SIGSEGV violation was detected which usually means that
the input file has been corrupted. <br>
Compression: xx.xx% <br>
Percentage of the input saved by compression. (Relevant only
for -v.) <br>
-- not a regular file or directory: ignored <br>
When the input file is not a regular file or directory,
(e.g. a symbolic link, socket, FIFO, device file), it is
left unaltered. <br>
-- has xx other links: unchanged <br>
The input file has links; it is left unchanged. See ln(1)
for more information. Use the -f flag to force compression
of multiply-linked files. <br>
-- file unchanged <br>
No savings is achieved by compression. The input remains
virgin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Although compressed files are compatible between machines
with large memory, -b12 should be used for file transfer to
architectures with a small process data space (64KB or less,
<br>
as exhibited by the DEC PDP series, the Intel 80286,
etc.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Invoking compress with a -r flag
will occasionally cause it to produce spurious error
warnings of the form</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;&lt;filename&gt;.Z already
has .Z suffix - ignored&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These warnings can be ignored.
See the comments in compress42.c:compdir() in the source
distribution for an explanation.</p>
