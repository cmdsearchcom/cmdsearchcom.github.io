<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ldns-compare-zones - read and compare two zonefiles and
print differences</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ldns-compare-zones [-c] [-i] [-d] [-z] [-s] ZONEFILE1
ZONEFILE2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
ldns-compare-zones reads two DNS zone files and prints
number of differences. <br>
Output is formated to: <br>
+NUM_INS -NUM_DEL ~NUM_CHG</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The major comparison is based on
the owner name. If an owner name is present in zonefile 1,
but not in zonefile 2, the resource records with this owner
name are considered <br>
deleted, and counted as NUM_DEL. If an owner name is present
in zonefile 2, but not in zonefile 1, the resource records
with this owner name are considered inserted, and counted
<br>
as NUM_INS. If an owner name is present in both, but there
is a difference in the amount or content of the records,
these are considered changed, and counted as NUM_CHG.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-c Print resource records whose owner names are in both zone
files, but with different resource records. (a.k.a.
changed)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i Print resource records whose
owner names are present only in ZONEFILE2 (a.k.a.
inserted)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Print resource records whose
owner names are present only in ZONEFILE1 (a.k.a.
deleted)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a Print all changes. Specifying
this option is the same as specifying -c -i amd -d.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z Suppress zone sorting; this
option is not recommended; it can cause records to be
incorrectly marked as changed, depending of the nature of
the changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Do not exclude the SOA record
from the comparison. The SOA record may then show up as
changed due to a new serial number. Off by default since you
may be interested to <br>
know if (other zone apex elements) have changed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Show usage and exit</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Show the version and exit</p>
