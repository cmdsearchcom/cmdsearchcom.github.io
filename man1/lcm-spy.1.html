<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
lcm-spy - traffic inspection tool</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
lcm-spy [options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
lcm-spy is the Lightweight Communications and Marshalling
traffic inspection utility. It is a graphical tool for
viewing messages received on an LCM network, and is
analagous to <br>
tools like Ethereal/Wireshark and tcpdump in that it is able
to inspect all LCM messages received and provide information
and statistics on the channels used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When given appropriate LCM type
definitions, lcm-spy is able to automatically detect and
decode messages, and can display the individual fields of
recognized messages. lcm-spy <br>
is limited to displaying statistics for unrecognized
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lcm-spy collects the following
statistics for each channel:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Channel name</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Number of messages
received</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Message Rate (Hz)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Bandwidth (KB/s)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On its own, this information can
often be used to verify that messages are being transmitted
on the expected channels, and at the expected data
rates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The following options are provided by lcm-spy</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, --lcm-url=URL <br>
Use the specified LCM URL</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Shows some help text and exits</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTOMATIC MESSAGE DECODING <br>
If a Java class generated by lcm-gen for an LCM type
definition is contained within a JAR file that is on the
Java classpath, lcm-spy automatically detects the class and
uses <br>
Java reflection to insert the corresponding LCM type
definitions into a type database. Subsequently, lcm-spy is
able to automatically recognize and decode messages received
that <br>
correspond to all such types.</p>
