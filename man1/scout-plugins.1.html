<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
scout-plugins - How to write plugins for Scout</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Sub-commands to Scout are called actions. A sub-command
should represent an action that the user performs on
notes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Action modules are subclasses of
scout.plugins.ActionPlugin. The perform_action is the
action&rsquo;s entry point -- so the main program will call
this method to delegate control -- <br>
and this method must be overridden. It can import scout
classes and any other packages to help in its task. An
action should use scout to get or send information from or
to <br>
Tomboy or Gnote and use the standard input, output and error
streams as its interface with the user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Actions are listed dynamically
in scout&rsquo;s basic help message and will appear as soon
as setuptools knows about the subscriptiong to the entry
point. Their descriptions are taken <br>
from the first line of the action module&rsquo;s docstring.
Make sure to keep the docstring&rsquo;s first line short but
precise. The entire line (with two leading spaces for
indentation, <br>
the action&rsquo;s name and its description) should fit in
less than 80 characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Subscribing an action to the
setuptools entry point is done via a setup.py script. For
example, let&rsquo;s subscribe a new action named backup
that is defined in the module <br>
scout-backup in the class named BackupAction:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">from setuptools import setup
<br>
setup( <br>
name=&quot;scout-backup&quot;, <br>
# ... <br>
entry_points = { <br>
&quot;scout.actions&quot;: [ <br>
&quot;backup = scout-backup::BackupAction&quot;, <br>
], <br>
} <br>
)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KeyboardInterrupt exceptions are
handled by the main application. An action can intercept
this exception if it needs to rollback an operation in order
to finish its work in a <br>
consistant state. The user should be warned right away that
the application is trying to stop its work. After the state
is safe, the action should re-raise the KeyboardInter&acirc;
<br>
rupt exception so that the application exits cleanly.</p>
