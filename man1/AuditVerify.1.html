<p>AuditVerify(1) PKI Signed Audit Log Verification Command
AuditVerify(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
AuditVerify - Command-Line utility for verifying Certificate
System signed audit logs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
AuditVerify -d &lt;dbdir&gt; -n
&lt;signing_certificate_nickname&gt; -a &lt;logListFile&gt;
[-P cert/key_db_prefix] [-v]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The AuditVerify command provides command-line utility to
verify that signed audit logs were signed with the
appropriate CS audit private signing key and that the audit
logs have <br>
not been compromised. Auditors can verify the authenticity
and integrity of signed audit logs using the AuditVerify
tool. This tool uses the public key of the signed audit log
<br>
signing certificate to verify the digital signatures
embedded in a signed audit log file. The tool result
indicates either that the signed audit log was successfully
verified or <br>
that the signed audit log was not successfully verified. An
unsuccessful verification warns the auditor that the
signature failed to verify, indicating the log file may have
been <br>
tampered with (compromised).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: An auditor can be any user
that has the privilege to peruse the pki audit logs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-d &lt;dbdir&gt; <br>
Specifies the directory containing the security databases
with the imported audit log signing certificate. This
directory is almost always the auditor&rsquo;s own personal
cer&acirc; <br>
tificate databases in a personal directory, such as
~jsmith/auditVerifyDir/.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n
&lt;signing_certificate_nickname&gt; <br>
Gives the nickname of the certificate used to sign the log
files. The nickname is whatever was used when the log
signing certificate was imported into that database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[-P cert/key_db_prefix] <br>
Optional. The prefix to prepend to the certificate and key
database filenames. If used, a value of empty quotation
marks (&acirc;&acirc;) should be specified for this
argument, since <br>
the auditor is using separate certificate and key databases
from the Certificate System instance and it is unlikely that
the prefix should be prepended to the new audit <br>
security database files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a &lt;logListFile&gt; <br>
Specifies the file which contains the comma-separate list of
file paths (in chronological order) of the signed audit logs
to be verified. This file should be created in a <br>
directory which is writeable by the auditor, such as a
special auditing directory like ~jsmith/auditDir. The
contents of the logListFile are the full paths to the audit
<br>
logs. For example:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">/var/log/pki/pki-ca/ca/signedAudit/ca_audit,/var/log/pki/pki-ca/ca/signedAudit/ca_audit.20030227102711,/var/log/pki/pki-ca/ca/signedAudit/ca_audit.20030226094015</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[-v] Optional. Specifies verbose
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Setting up the Auditor&rsquo;s
Database <br>
AuditVerify needs access to a set of security databases
(usually the auditor&rsquo;s personal security databases)
containing the signed audit log signing certificate and its
chain of <br>
issuing certificates. One of the CA certificates in the
issuance chain must be marked as trusted in the
database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Auditors should import the audit
signing certificate into their personal certificate database
before running AuditVerify. The auditor should not use the
security databases of the <br>
Certificate System instance that generated the signed audit
log files. If there are no readily accessible certificate
and key database, the auditor must create a set of
certifi&acirc; <br>
cate and key databases and import the signed audit log
signing certificate chain.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To create the security databases
and import the certificate chain:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Create a special directory in
the auditor&rsquo;s home directory to use to perform the
verification. For example: <br>
mkdir ~jsmith/auditVerifyDir</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use the certutil tool to create
an empty set of certificate databases in the auditor&rsquo;s
home directory. <br>
certutil -d ~jsmith/auditVerifyDir -N</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Download the CA certificate from
the CA&rsquo;s Retrieval page. The certificates can be
obtained from the CA in ASCII format. <br>
https://server.example.com:ca_https_port/ca/ee/ca/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Import the CA certificate and
log signing certificate into the databases and set trust of
the certificates <br>
If the CA certificate is in a file called cacert.txt and the
log signing certificate is in a file called logsigncert.txt,
then the certutil can be used to set the trust for the <br>
new audit security database directory pointing to those
files, as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">certutil -d
~jsmith/auditVerifyDir/ -A -n &quot;CA Certificate&quot; -t
&quot;CT,CT,CT&quot; -a -i cacert.txt</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">certutil -d
~jsmith/auditVerifyDir -A -n &quot;Log Signing
Certificate&quot; -t &quot;,,P&quot; -a -i
logsigncert.txt</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: The signedAudit directory
kept by the subsystem is not writeable by any user,
including auditors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Operation <br>
After a separate audit database directory has been
configured, do the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Create a text file containing a
comma-separated list of the log files to be verified. The
name of this file is referenced in the AuditVerify command.
<br>
For example, this file could be logListFile in the
~jsmith/auditVerifyDir/ directory. The contents are the
comma-separated list of audit logs to be verified, such as
&quot;audit&acirc; <br>
log.1213, auditlog.1214, auditlog.1215.&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the audit databases do not
contain prefixes and are located in the user home directory,
such as ~jsmith/.mozilla, and the signing certificate
nickname is Log Signing Certificate , <br>
the AuditVerify command is run as follows: <br>
AuditVerify -d ~jsmith/auditVerifyDir -n Log Signing
Certificate -a ~jsmith/auditVerifyDir/logListFile -P
&quot;&quot; -v</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: It has been observed that
if audit signing is enabled after system is first started,
the first audit signature would not be verified. What
happens is that the signature <br>
starts calculating from it&rsquo;s in-memory audit log
message when it signs, and since log signing is turned on
mid-way (not from a fresh new log file), the previous
content were not <br>
signed along for calculating the first signature (and
rightfully so). When AuditVerify is run, it does not know
where the log signing begins, so it assumes it starts from
the <br>
beginning of the file till the first signature. This is why
the first signature (if signing is turned on mid-way) will
always appear to be incorrect.</p>
