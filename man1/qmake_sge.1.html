<p>QMAKE(1) Grid Engine User Commands QMAKE(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
qmake - distributed parallel make, scheduling by Grid
Engine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNTAX <br>
qmake [options] -- [gmake options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Qmake is a parallel, distributed make(1) utility. Scheduling
of the parallel make tasks is done by Grid Engine. It is
based on GNU make, version 3.82 (&quot;gmake). Both Grid
Engine <br>
and GNU make command line options can be specified. They are
separated by &quot;--&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All Grid Engine options valid
with qsub(1) or qrsh(1) can be specified with qmake. See
submit(1) for a description of all Grid Engine command line
options. The GNU Make manual <br>
(via info) or the make(1) manual page describes the gmake
command line syntax.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The syntax of qmake makefiles
corresponds to gmake and is described in the &quot;GNU Make
Manual&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A typical qmake call will use
the Grid Engine command line options -cwd to have a
scheduled make started in the current working directory on
the execution host, -v PATH if the <br>
Grid Engine environment is not set up in the user&rsquo;s
.cshrc Or .profile shell resource file, and also request
slots in a parallel environment (see sge_pe(5)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no resource request (Grid
Engine command line option -l) is specified, qmake will use
the environment variable SGE_ARCH to request the same
architecture as the submit host for <br>
task execution. If SGE_ARCH is set, the architecture
specified in SGE_ARCH will be requested by inserting the
option -l arch=$SGE_ARCH into the command line options. If
<br>
SGE_ARCH is not set, the make tasks can be executed on any
available architecture. As this is critical for typical make
(compile) jobs, a warning will be output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">qmake has two different modes
for allocating Grid Engine resources for the parallel
execution of tasks:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. Allocation of resources using
a parallel environment. If the -pe option is used on the
qmake command line, a parallel job is scheduled by Grid
Engine. The make rules are <br>
executed as tasks within this parallel job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Dynamic allocation of
resources. If no parallel environment is requested when
submitting a qmake job, each make rule will generate an
individual Grid Engine qrsh job. All <br>
resource requests given to qmake will be inherited by the
jobs processing the make rules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In dynamic allocation mode,
additional resource requests for individual rules can be
specified by preceding the rule by the definition of an
environment variable SGE_RREQ. The <br>
rule then takes the form <br>
SGE_RREQ=&quot;request&quot; rule <br>
e.g. <br>
SGE_RREQ=&quot;-l lic=1&quot; cc -c ... <br>
If such makefile rules are executed in a make utility other
than qmake, the environment variable SGE_RREQ will be set in
the environment established for the rule&rsquo;s execution -
<br>
presumably without any effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
qmake -cwd -v PATH -pe compiling 1-10 --</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will request between 1 and 10
slots in parallel environment &quot;compiling&quot;. If the
SGE_ARCH environment variable is set to the machine
architecture, a resource request will be <br>
inserted into the qmake command line to start the qmake job
on the same architecture as the submit host. The make tasks
will inherit the complete environment of the calling <br>
shell, and as as many parallel tasks will execute as slots
have been granted by Grid Engine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">qmake -l arch=sol-sparc -cwd -v
PATH -- -j 4</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will submit each make rule as an
individual qrsh job. A maximum of 4 tasks will be processed
in parallel. The qmake job will be started on a machine of
architecture sol-sparc. <br>
This resource request will also be inherited by the make
tasks, i.e. all jobs created for the execution of make tasks
will request the architecture sol-sparc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the following Makefile is
submitted with the above command line, additional resource
requests will be made for individual rules: For the compile
and link rules, compiler <br>
licenses (comp) and linker licenses (link) will be
requested, in addition to the resource request made for the
whole job (-l arch=sol-sparc) on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">all: test</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">clean: <br>
rm -f test main.o functions.o</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">test: main.o functions.o <br>
SGE_RREQ=&quot;-l link=1&quot; ld -o test main.o
functions.o</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">main.o: main.c <br>
SGE_RREQ=&quot;-l comp=1&quot; cc -c -DALIASPATH=</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">functions.o: functions.c <br>
SGE_RREQ=&quot;-l comp=1&quot; cc -c -DALIASPATH=</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The command line <br>
qmake -cwd -v PATH -l arch=sol-sparc64 -pe make 3 --</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will request 3 parallel make
tasks to be executed on hosts of architecture
&quot;sol-sparc64&quot;. The submit may be done on a host of
any architecture.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The shell script</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#!/bin/sh <br>
qmake -inherit --</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">can be submitted by</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">qsub -cwd -v PATH -pe make 1-10
[further sge options] &lt;script&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Qmake will inherit the resources
granted for the job submitted above under parallel
environment &quot;make&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
SGE_ROOT Specifies the location of the Grid Engine standard
configuration files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SGE_CELL If set, specifies the
default Grid Engine cell. To address a Grid Engine cell
qmake uses (in the order of precedence):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The name of the cell specified
in the environment variable SGE_CELL, if it is set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The name of the default cell,
i.e. default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SGE_DEBUG_LEVEL <br>
If set, specifies that debug information should be written
to stderr. In addition the level of detail in which debug
information is generated is defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SGE_ARCH The architecture of the
submit host. If this variable is set in the submission
environment, qmake will request the given architecture for
job execution (see <br>
DESCRIPTION above).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KNOWN PROBLEMS <br>
Slow NFS server <br>
Very low file server performance may lead to problems on
dependent files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example: Host a compiles a.c to
a.o, host b compiles b.c to b.o, host c shall link program c
from a.o and b.o. In case of very bad NFS performance, host
c might not yet see files <br>
a.o and b.o.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Multiple commands in one rule
<br>
If multiple commands are executed in one rule, the makefile
has to ensure that they are handled as one command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">libx.a: <br>
cc -c x.c <br>
ar ru libx.a x.o</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Building libx.a will fail if the
commands are executed in parallel (and possibly on different
hosts). Write the following instead:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">libx.a: <br>
cc -c x.c ; ar ru libx.a x.o</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">libx.a: <br>
cc -c x.c ; ar ru libx.a x.o</p>
