<p>ipmi_ui(1) Crude interface to an IPMI system
ipmi_ui(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ipmi_ui - Crude interface to an IPMI system</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ipmi_ui [-dmsg] [-dmem] [-c] connection-1[connection-2]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The connections are specified as
either:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">smi smi-num</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lan IP-addr port [IP-addr-2
port-2] auth privilege username password</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The ipmi_ui program connects to an IPMI system, and allows
access to IPMI entities and sensors and OpenIPMI controls.
It&rsquo;s rather crude, and primarily for testing OpenIPMI,
but <br>
it has some use beyond that so it is provided.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normally, ipmi_ui starts up in a
full-screen format. The left window shows the output of
commands, the right window shows the logs from OpenIPMI.
Both windows are scrollable <br>
with page up and page down keys, press the &quot;F1&quot;
key to choose the left window to scroll, the &quot;F2&quot;
key to choose the right window to scroll.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that you must set your
environment TERM variable properly for your terminal, or
ipmi_ui will display garbage on the screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that you can put two
connection specifications on the command line, and ipmi_ui
will make two connection. You can only do this if the
connections are to the same IPMI <br>
domain through different management controllers. Also, each
LAN connection may have two IP addresses. These are two
different addresses to the same management controller. So
<br>
you may have a total of 4 IP addresses to an IPMI domain,
two management controllers and two IP addresses to each
management controller.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-dmsg Turn on message debugging, this will dump all messages
to the log window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dmem Turn on memory debugging,
this will cause memory allocation and deallocations to be
checked. When the program terminates, it will dump all
memory that was not properly <br>
freed (leaked).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-snmp Enable the SNMP trap
handler. ipmi_ui must be compiled with SNMP code enabled for
this option to be available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Run the program in
command-line mode. This is useful for scripting. All output
goes to standard output, there is no windowing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">smi-num <br>
The SMI number to connect to, for systems with more than on
system interface. Generally, this is &rsquo;0&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IP-addr <br>
The IP address of the LAN interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">port The UDP port of the LAN
interface, general 623.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IP-addr-2 <br>
Some systems support multiple IP connections, this specified
the second address and is optional. If specified, OpenIPMI
will use both IP addresses and fail over to the <br>
working one if one of them fails.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">port-2 The port for the second
IP connection, generally 623.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">auth The authorization to use
for the connection, either &quot;none&quot;,
&quot;straight&quot;, &quot;md5&quot;, or
&quot;md2&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">privilege <br>
The privilege to use for the connection, either
&quot;callback&quot;, &quot;user&quot;,
&quot;operator&quot;, or &quot;admin&quot;. Note that some
IPMI operations will fail without the correct privilege.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">username <br>
The user name to use for the connection. If using this
anonymous user, this should be the empty string
&quot;&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">password <br>
The password to use for the connection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENTITIES <br>
Entities are listed by their entity id (the type of entity
they are) and their entity instance. Entities may be active
or inactive in the system, the standard IPMI algorithm for
<br>
determining this is used. Commands on entities are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">entities <br>
List all the entities in the system. The output is the
entity specifier, followed by an optional entity name in
parenthesis, followed by &quot;present&quot; or &quot;not
present&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">check_presence <br>
For the check of presence for all entities.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fru entity <br>
List the FRU information associated with the entity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dump_fru is_logical
device_address device_id lun private_bus channel <br>
Dump raw information from the specified FRU device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SENSORS <br>
Sensors define input devices that OpenIPMI can monitor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sensors entity <br>
List all the sensors that monitor the given entity. The
output is the sensor specifier (the entity specifier
followed by the sensor name, with spaces converted to ~).
<br>
followed by the sensor name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sensor sensor <br>
Pull up the given sensor and display all its information. In
full-screen mode, the sensor will be re-queried every
second.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rearm global [assertion-mask
deassertion-mask] <br>
Rearm the given sensor. If global is 1, then the whole
sensor is rearmed. If global is 0, then the assertion-mask
and deassertion-mask must be specified telling which <br>
thresholds or states to rearm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">events_enable events scanning
assertion-bitmask deassertion-bitmask <br>
Enable or disable events for the given sensor. events turns
events on or off from the sensor (0 or 1). scanning turns
scanning on or off for the sensor (0 or 1). asser&acirc;
<br>
tion-bitmask specifies the bitmask of thresholds or states
that should be enabled or disabled when a threshold or state
is asserted. It is a bunch of 0&rsquo;s and 1&rsquo;s, where
<br>
the first one is for threshold/state 0, the second for
threshold/state 1, etc. deassertion-bitmask specifies the
bitmask of thresholds or states that should be enabled or
<br>
disabled when a threshold or state is deasserted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONTROLS <br>
Controls are output devices that can control things like
LEDs, power, reset lines and such.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">controls entity <br>
List all the controls that control the given entity. The
output is the control specifier (the entity specifier
followed by the control name, with spaces converted to ~).
<br>
followed by the control name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">control control <br>
Pull up the given control and display it&rsquo;s current
state.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set_control val1 [val2 ...] <br>
Change the value of a control. Note that for controls with
multiple values, every value must be specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EVENTS <br>
Events are asynchronous messages from sensors that tell the
user that a sensor has done something. Events are generally
stored in a system event log (SEL); OpenIPMI will fetch <br>
the events from the SELs in the system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since multiple SELs may exist,
an event is specified by the MC it came from in the format
&quot;(channel addr)&quot; and a log number. The same log
number may exist in multiple MCs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Events are displayed in the log
window as they come in. If they can be correlated with a
sensor, they will be display with as much information as
possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">delevent channel mc-addr log-num
<br>
Delete the given event. Note that many SELs do not support
individual deletes, so this may only delete the local copy
of the event, not the one in the SEL. In this case, <br>
to delete events in the SEL, you must delete all the events
in the SEL and wait about 10 seconds for OpenIPMI to do a
full SEL clear.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">clear_sel <br>
Delete all events in the SEL. This process may take some
time, so if you do this and quit immediately it may not be
complete.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list_sel <br>
List all events in the local copy of the SELs. This is only
the local copy, if the copies in the actual have change,
this won&rsquo;t be reflected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">get_sel_time channel mc-num <br>
Get the time in the SEL for the given MC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MANAGMENT CONTROLLERS (MCs) <br>
In OpenIPMI, you normally don&rsquo;t deal with management
controllers. They are considered internal to the system.
However, for debugging, information about them is
provided.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mcs List all the MCs in the
system and whether they are active. MCs are displayed in the
format &quot;(channel address)&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mc channel mc-addr <br>
Display a boatload of information about the MC, mostly
coming from the get device id command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mccmd channel mc-addr LUN NetFN
Cmd [data ...] <br>
Send an IPMI command to the given MC. The MC must exist and
be active to do this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mc_reset channel mc-addr [warm |
cold] <br>
Send a warm or cold reset command to the given MC. The
action the MC takes is system-specific.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">scan channel mc-addr <br>
Scan for an MC at the given address. If the MC exists but
OpenIPMI didn&rsquo;t know about it, it will be added. If
the MC no longer exists, then it will be removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mc_events_enable channel mc-num
enabled <br>
Enable or disable event generation for the given MC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mc_events_enabled channel mc-num
<br>
Prints out if the events are enabled for the given MC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LAN Parameter Configuration <br>
OpenIPMI has functions that make it easier to configure the
LAN parameters of a LAN connection. Note that the LAN
parameters have a lock that OpenIPMI attempts to use. If you
<br>
read the LAN parameters, they will be locked until you
either write them or clear the lock.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">readlanparm channel mc-num
channel <br>
Read lanparm information from an MC and display it in the
display window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">viewlanparm <br>
Show current lanparm information in the display window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">writelanparm channel mc-num
channel <br>
Write the current LANPARM information to an MC. Note that
this must be the MC that the parameters were read from.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">clearlanparmlock [channel mc-num
channel] <br>
Clear a LANPARM lock. If the MC is given, then the LANPARM
lock is directly cleared. If not given, then the LANPARM
lock for the current parms is cleared.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">setlanparm config [selector]
value <br>
Set the given config item to the value. The optional
selector is used for items that take a selector, like
&quot;auth&quot; or any of the items in
&quot;destination&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Platform Event Filter (PEF) <br>
OpenIPMI contains function to help manage the PEF settings
on a BMC. Note that the PEF parameters have a lock that
OpenIPMI attempts to use. If you read the PEF parameters,
<br>
they will be locked until you either write them or clear the
lock.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">readpef channel mc-num <br>
Read the PEF information from an MC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">clearpeflock [channel mc-num]
<br>
Clear a PEF lock. If the MC is given, then the PEF lock on
that MC is directly cleared. If no MC is given, then the
current PEF&rsquo;s lock is cleared.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">viewpef <br>
Show current pef information in the display window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">writepef channel mc-num <br>
Write the current PEF information to an MC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">setpef config [selector] value
<br>
Set the given config item to the value. The optional
selector is used for items that take a selector, like
anything in the event filters, alert policies, or alert <br>
strings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pet connection channel ip-addr
mac_addr eft-selector policy-num apt-selector
lan-dest-selector <br>
Set up the connection for the domain to send PET traps from
the given connection to the given IP/MAC address over the
given channel. This does all the LAN and PEF config&acirc;
<br>
uration required to configure a system to send event
traps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONNECTIONS <br>
OpenIPMI can maintain multiple connections to a single
domain. It will generally only use one of these at a time
(although the other will constantly be under test). This is
the <br>
&quot;active&quot; connection. You can query and set which
connection is active.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The connection number is the
connection from the command line. You can specify two
connections on the command line (the part beginning with
&quot;lan&quot;, &quot;smi&quot;, etc.). The first
con&acirc; <br>
nection you specify is connection zero, the second is
connection 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">is_con_active connection <br>
Print out if the given connection is active or not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">activate_con connection <br>
Activate the given connection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OTHER COMMANDS <br>
msg channel IPMB-addr LUN NetFN Cmd [data ...] <br>
Send an IPMI command to the given IPMB address. This is
available in case the given MC cannot be found or
enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sdrs channel mc-addr do-sensors
<br>
Dump all the sdrs from the given MC. If do-sensors is true,
then dump the device SDR. If it is false, dump the main SDR
repository on the MC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">scan channel IPMB-addr <br>
Perform an IPMB bus scan for the given IPMB, to try to
detect an MC at the given address. IPMB bus scanning can be
slow, this can help speed things up if you already know <br>
the address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">quit Leave the program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reconnect <br>
Attempt to disconnect and reconnect to the IPMI controller.
This is primarily for testing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">display_win <br>
Set the display window (left window) for scrolling, just in
case the &quot;F1&quot; key doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">log_win <br>
Set the log window (right window) for scrolling, just in
case the &quot;F2&quot; key doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">help Dump some terse help output
about all the commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ERROR OUTPUT <br>
All error output goes to the log window.</p>
