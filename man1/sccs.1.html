<p>SCCS(1) BSD General Commands Manual SCCS(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
sccs &acirc; front end for the SCCS subsystem</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
sccs [-r] [-d path] [-T] [-V] [--version] [-p path]
[--prefix=path] [--cssc] command [flags] [file ...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Sccs is a front end to the SCCS programs that helps them
mesh more cleanly with the rest of UNIX. It also includes
the capability to run &acirc;set user id&acirc; to another
user to provide <br>
additional protection (but see the section entitled
BUGS).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Basically, sccs runs the command
with the specified flags and args. Each argument is normally
modified to be prepended with &acirc;SCCS/s.&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Flags to be interpreted by the
sccs program must be before the command argument. Flags to
be passed to the actual SCCS program must come after the
command argument. These flags <br>
are specific to the command and are discussed in the
documentation for that command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Besides the usual SCCS commands,
several &acirc;pseudo-commands&acirc; can be issued. These
are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">edit Equivalent to &acirc;get
-e&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">delget Perform a delta on the
named files and then get new versions. The new versions will
have id keywords expanded, and will not be editable. The -m,
-p, -r, -s, and -y flags <br>
will be passed to delta, and the -b, -c, -e, -i, -k, -l, -s,
and -x flags will be passed to get.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">deledit Equivalent to delget
except that the get phase includes the -e flag. This option
is useful for making a checkpoint of your current editing
phase. The same flags will be <br>
passed to delta as described above, and all the flags listed
for get above except -e and -k are passed to edit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">create Creates an SCCS file ,
taking the initial contents from the file of the same name.
Any flags to admin are accepted. If the creation is
successful, the files are renamed <br>
with a comma on the front. These should be removed when you
are convinced that the SCCS files have been created
successfully.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fix Must be followed by a -r
flag. This command essentially removes the named delta, but
leaves you with a copy of the delta with the changes that
were in it. It is useful <br>
for fixing small compiler bugs, etc. Since it doesn&rsquo;t
leave audit trails, it should be used carefully.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">clean This routine removes
everything from the current directory that can be recreated
from SCCS files. It will not remove any files being edited.
If the -b flag is given, <br>
branches are ignored in the determination of whether they
are being edited; this is dangerous if you are keeping the
branches in the same directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unedit This is the opposite of
an edit or a &acirc;get -e&acirc;. It should be used with
extreme caution, since any changes you made since the get
will be irretrievably lost.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">info Gives a listing of all
files being edited. If the -b flag is given, branches (i.e.,
SID&Acirc;&acute;s with two or fewer components) are
ignored. If the -u flag is given (with an <br>
optional argument) then only files being edited by you (or
the named user) are listed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">check Like info except that
nothing is printed if nothing is being edited, and a
non-zero exit status is returned if anything is being
edited. The intent is to have this <br>
included in an install entry in a makefile to insure that
everything is included into the SCCS file before a version
is installed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tell Gives a newline-separated
list of the files being edited on the standard output. Takes
the -b and -u flags like info and check.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">diffs Gives a diff listing
between the current version of the program(s) you have out
for editing and the versions in SCCS format. The -r, -c, -i,
-x, and -t flags are passed <br>
to <br>
get; the -l, -s, -e, -f, -h, -u, -n, -w, and -b options are
passed to diff. The -a, -B, -d, -H, -p, -q, -s, -v, and -y
options are passed to diff but these options are <br>
(usually) specific to GNU diff, and so may not be supported
on systems other than GNU. The -C flag is passed to diff as
-c.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print This command prints out
verbose information about the named files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Certain commands (such as admin)
cannot be run &acirc;set user id&acirc; by all users, since
this would allow anyone to change the authorizations. These
commands are always run as the real <br>
user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--cssc Returns a zero exit value
(for the GNU version only). No other operation is performed.
This flag is used by the test suite to determine if it needs
to use the <br>
--prefix flag in order to find the correct subprograms
(non-GNU versions of sccs have the full pathnames for the
subprograms hard-coded). In this way, the CSSC test <br>
suite can be compiled ready for installation in a particular
directory, but the test suite can still be run before the
suite has been installed in its final position. <br>
This option is supported only by the GNU version of
sccs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--prefix=foo Uses foo as the
prefix for SCCS sub-commands. The default prefix is compiled
into the program and is usually &acirc;/usr/sccs&acirc;. You
can discover the prefix setting with <br>
the -V flag. This prefix is used without a final slash being
appended, so values like &acirc;/usr/local/bin/cssc-&acirc;
can be used. This option is disallowed if the program <br>
is installed setuid, and it is supported only by the GNU
version of sccs. This option is not equivalent to the -p
flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version Show version
information; synonymous with the -V flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Runs sccs as the real user
rather than as whatever effective user sccs is &acirc;set
user id&acirc; to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Specifies a root directory
for the SCCS files. The default is the current directory. If
environment variable PROJECTDIR is set, it will be used to
determine the -d <br>
flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p Defines the pathname of the
directory in which the SCCS files will be found;
&acirc;SCCS&acirc; is the default. The -p flag differs from
the -d flag in that the -d argument is <br>
prepended to the entire pathname and the -p argument is
inserted before the final component of the pathname. For
example, &acirc;sccs -d/x -py get a/b&acirc; will convert to
<br>
&acirc;get /x/a/y/s.b&acirc;. The intent here is to create
aliases such as &acirc;alias syssccs sccs -d/usr/src&acirc;
which will be used as &acirc;syssccs get cmd/who.c&acirc;.
Please note that the <br>
-p flag is (very) different in purpose from the --prefix
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T This flag causes the program
to emit a debugging trace on stdout. This flag may be
disabled at compile time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Shows the version information
for the sccs program, and the subcommand prefix being used.
This option is supported only by the GNU version of
sccs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
To get a file for editing, edit it, and produce a new
delta:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sccs get -e file.c <br>
ex file.c <br>
sccs delta file.c</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To get a file from another
directory:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sccs -p/usr/src/sccs/s. get
cc.c</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sccs get
/usr/src/sccs/s.cc.c</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To make a delta of a large
number of files in the current directory:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sccs delta *.c</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To get a list of files being
edited that are not on branches:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sccs info -b</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To delta everything being edited
by you:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sccs delta &lsquo;sccs tell
-u&lsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In a makefile, to get source
files from an SCCS file if it does not already exist:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SRCS = &lt;list of source
files&gt; <br>
$(SRCS): <br>
sccs get $(REL) $@</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MAINTAINER <br>
This version of sccs is maintained by James Youngman,
&lt;jay@gnu.org&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
PROJECTDIR</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The PROJECTDIR environment
variable is checked by the -d flag. If it begins with a
slash, it is taken directly; otherwise, the home directory
of a user of that name <br>
is examined for a subdirectory &acirc;src&acirc; or
&acirc;source&acirc;. If such a directory is found, it is
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
There are many error messages, mostly brief but fairly
obvious. If all goes acording to plan, the program&rsquo;s
exit status is zero. Otherwise, it will be one of the
following val&acirc; <br>
ues:-</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 No error; everything proceeded
according to plan.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">64 Command line usage error</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">69 Could not exec program</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">70 Internal software error. This
should not happen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">71 System error (e.g.,
can&rsquo;t fork)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">75 Temporary failure; retry
later. This error is returned when the system runs out of
memory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">77 Permission denied. This error
occurs when the program has been installed setuid, but
SCCSDIR was not configured in at compile time. This can also
happen if something goes <br>
wrong when the program tries to drop its setuid or setgid
privileges. When a program exits due to a fatal signal, the
shell usually adds 128 to the signal number and uses <br>
that as the return value. Some systems also produce values
in this range if there was a problem with the dynamic
linker.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY <br>
The sccs command appeared in 4.3BSD.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This version of sccs has been
slightly modified to support GNU Autoconf, and several new
options (those beginning with two dashes and also -V) and to
make it somewhat more porta&acirc; <br>
ble. The program otherwise remains largely unchanged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
It should be able to take directory arguments on
pseudo-commands like the SCCS commands do.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Though this program is mostly
derived from the original BSD code, the subprograms
accompanying it in the CSSC suite (admin, get, delta and so
on) are not the original AT&amp;T code. <br>
Please do not count on these programs being secure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other known bugs are listed in
the file BUGS, which accompanies GNU CSSC.</p>
