<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
adie - The ADvanced Interactive Editor</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INTRODUCTION <br>
Adie is an extremely fast and convenient programming text
editor written using the FOX Toolkit. Besides being a nice
text editor, Adie is also an extremely convenient file <br>
viewer, supporting a plethora of methods to move from one
file to the next.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For each visited file, Adie
remembers where in that file you were last looking, and
which special places in that file have been bookmarked, so
you can quickly return to fre&acirc; <br>
quently visited places.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Project browsing is made easy by
optionally displaying a File/Directory browser side by side
with the text so files may be visited by means of a single
click. Files may also be <br>
opened simply by highlighting a file name, compiler warning
message, or #include directive and hitting a single button;
Adie will search for the file in the same directory as an
<br>
already loaded file, or in a number of predefined
directories (like for example include directories).</p>
