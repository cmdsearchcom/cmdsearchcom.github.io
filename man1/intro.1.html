intro - introduction to user commands
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
Section 1 of the manual describes user commands and tools, for example, file
  manipulation tools, shells, compilers, web browsers, file and image viewers
  and editors, and so on.

All commands yield a status value on termination. This value can be tested
  (e.g., in most shells the variable <i>$?</i> contains the status of the last
  executed command) to see whether the command completed successfully. A zero
  exit status is conventionally used to indicate success, and a nonzero status
  means that the command was unsuccessful. (Details of the exit status can be
  found in <b>wait</b>(2).) A nonzero exit status can be in the range 1 to 255,
  and some commands use different nonzero status values to indicate the reason
  why the command failed.

Linux is a flavor of UNIX, and as a first approximation all user commands under
  UNIX work precisely the same under Linux (and FreeBSD and lots of other
  UNIX-like systems).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Under Linux there are GUIs (graphical user interfaces), where you can point and
  click and drag, and hopefully get work done without first reading lots of
  documentation. The traditional UNIX environment is a CLI (command line
  interface), where you type commands to tell the computer what to do. That is
  faster and more powerful, but requires finding out what the commands are.
  Below a bare minimum, to get started.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Login"><a class="selflink" href="#Login">Login</a></h2>
In order to start working, you probably first have to login, that is, give your
  username and password. See also <b>login</b>(1). The program <i>login</i> now
  starts a <i>shell</i> (command interpreter) for you. In case of a graphical
  login, you get a screen with menus or icons and a mouse click will start a
  shell in a window. See also <b>xterm</b>(1).
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="The_shell"><a class="selflink" href="#The_shell">The
  shell</a></h2>
One types commands to the <i>shell</i>, the command interpreter. It is not
  built-in, but is just a program and you can change your shell. Everybody has
  her own favorite one. The standard one is called <i>sh</i>. See also
  <b>ash</b>(1), <b>bash</b>(1), <b>csh</b>(1), <b>zsh</b>(1), <b>chsh</b>(1).

and here typing Control-D ended the session. The <b>% </b> here was the command
  prompt&#x2014;it is the shell's way of indicating that it is ready for the
  next command. The prompt can be customized in lots of ways, and one might
  include stuff like username, machine name, current directory, time, and so on.
  An assignment PS1=&quot;What next, master? &quot; would change the prompt as
  indicated.
<div class="Pp"></div>
We see that there are commands <i>date</i> (that gives date and time), and
  <i>cal</i> (that gives a calendar).
<div class="Pp"></div>
The command <i>ls</i> lists the contents of the current directory&#x2014;it
  tells you what files you have. With a <i>-l</i> option it gives a long
  listing, that includes the owner and size and date of the file, and the
  permissions people have for reading and/or changing the file. For example, the
  file &quot;tel&quot; here is 37 bytes long, owned by aeb and the owner can
  read and write it, others can only read it. Owner and permissions can be
  changed by the commands <i>chown</i> and <i>chmod</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The command <i>cat</i> will show the contents of a file. (The name is from
  &quot;concatenate and print&quot;: all files given as parameters are
  concatenated and sent to &quot;standard output&quot;, here the terminal
  screen.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
The command <i>cp</i> (from &quot;copy&quot;) will copy a file. On the other
  hand, the command <i>mv</i> (from &quot;move&quot;) only renames it.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The command <i>diff</i> lists the differences between two files. Here there was
  no output because there were no differences.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The command <i>rm</i> (from &quot;remove&quot;) deletes the file, and be
  careful! it is gone. No wastepaper basket or anything. Deleted means lost.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The command <i>grep</i> (from &quot;g/re/p&quot;) finds occurrences of a string
  in one or more files. Here it finds Maja's telephone number.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Pathnames_and_the_current_directory"><a class="selflink" href="#Pathnames_and_the_current_directory">Pathnames
  and the current directory</a></h2>
Files live in a large tree, the file hierarchy. Each has a <i>pathname</i>
  describing the path from the root of the tree (which is called /) to the file.
  For example, such a full pathname might be /home/aeb/tel. Always using full
  pathnames would be inconvenient, and the name of a file in the current
  directory may be abbreviated by giving only the last component. That is why
  &quot;/home/aeb/tel&quot; can be abbreviated to &quot;tel&quot; when the
  current directory is &quot;/home/aeb&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The command <i>pwd</i> prints the current directory.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The command <i>cd</i> changes the current directory. Try &quot;cd /&quot; and
  &quot;pwd&quot; and &quot;cd&quot; and &quot;pwd&quot;.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Directories"><a class="selflink" href="#Directories">Directories</a></h2>
The command <i>mkdir</i> makes a new directory.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The command <i>rmdir</i> removes a directory if it is empty, and complains
  otherwise.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The command <i>find</i> (with a rather baroque syntax) will find files with
  given name or other properties. For example, &quot;find . -name tel&quot;
  would find the file &quot;tel&quot; starting in the present directory (which
  is called &quot;.&quot;). And &quot;find / -name tel&quot; would do the same,
  but starting at the root of the tree. Large searches on a multi-GB disk will
  be time-consuming, and it may be better to use <b>locate</b>(1).
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Disks_and_filesystems"><a class="selflink" href="#Disks_and_filesystems">Disks
  and filesystems</a></h2>
The command <i>mount</i> will attach the file system found on some disk (or
  floppy, or CDROM or so) to the big file system hierarchy. And <i>umount</i>
  detaches it again. The command <i>df</i> will tell you how much of your disk
  is still free.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Processes"><a class="selflink" href="#Processes">Processes</a></h2>
On a UNIX system many user and system processes run simultaneously. The one you
  are talking to runs in the <i>foreground</i>, the others in the
  <i>background</i>. The command <i>ps</i> will show you which processes are
  active and what numbers these processes have. The command <i>kill</i> allows
  you to get rid of them. Without option this is a friendly request: please go
  away. And &quot;kill -9&quot; followed by the number of the process is an
  immediate kill. Foreground processes can often be killed by typing Control-C.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Getting_information"><a class="selflink" href="#Getting_information">Getting
  information</a></h2>
There are thousands of commands, each with many options. Traditionally commands
  are documented on <i>man pages</i>, (like this one), so that the command
  &quot;man kill&quot; will document the use of the command &quot;kill&quot;
  (and &quot;man man&quot; document the command &quot;man&quot;). The program
  <i>man</i> sends the text through some <i>pager</i>, usually <i>less</i>. Hit
  the space bar to get the next page, hit q to quit.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In documentation it is customary to refer to man pages by giving the name and
  section number, as in <b>man</b>(1). Man pages are terse, and allow you to
  find quickly some forgotten detail. For newcomers an introductory text with
  more examples and explanations is useful.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A lot of GNU/FSF software is provided with info files. Type &quot;info
  info&quot; for an introduction on the use of the program &quot;info&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Special topics are often treated in HOWTOs. Look in
  <i>/usr/share/doc/howto/en</i> and use a browser if you find HTML files there.
