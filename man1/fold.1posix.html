<p>FOLD(1POSIX) POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s Manual
FOLD(1POSIX)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROLOG <br>
This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s
Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of <br>
Linux behavior), or the interface may not be implemented on
Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
fold &acirc; filter for folding lines</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
fold [&acirc;bs] [&acirc;w width] [file...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The fold utility is a filter that shall fold lines from its
input files, breaking the lines to have a maximum of width
column positions (or bytes, if the &acirc;b option is
specified). <br>
Lines shall be broken by the insertion of a &lt;newline&gt;
such that each output line (referred to later in this
section as a segment) is the maximum width possible that
does not <br>
exceed the specified number of column positions (or bytes).
A line shall not be broken in the middle of a character. The
behavior is undefined if width is less than the number of
<br>
columns any single character in the input would occupy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the &lt;carriage-return&gt;,
&lt;backspace&gt;, or &lt;tab&gt; characters are encountered
in the input, and the &acirc;b option is not specified, they
shall be treated specially:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;backspace&gt; <br>
The current count of line width shall be decremented by one,
although the count never shall become negative. The fold
utility shall not insert a &lt;newline&gt; immediately <br>
before or after any &lt;backspace&gt;, unless the following
character has a width greater than 1 and would cause the
line width to exceed width.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;carriage-return&gt; <br>
The current count of line width shall be set to zero. The
fold utility shall not insert a &lt;newline&gt; immediately
before or after any &lt;carriage-return&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;tab&gt; Each &lt;tab&gt;
encountered shall advance the column position pointer to the
next tab stop. Tab stops shall be at each column position n
such that n modulo 8 equals 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The fold utility shall conform to the Base Definitions
volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax
Guidelines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options shall be
supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;b Count width in bytes
rather than column positions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;s If a segment of a line
contains a &lt;blank&gt; within the first width column
positions (or bytes), break the line after the last such
&lt;blank&gt; meeting the width constraints. <br>
If there is no &lt;blank&gt; meeting the requirements, the
&acirc;s option shall have no effect for that output segment
of the input line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;w width Specify the
maximum line length, in column positions (or bytes if
&acirc;b is specified). The results are unspecified if width
is not a positive decimal number. The default <br>
value shall be 80.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERANDS <br>
The following operand shall be supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file A pathname of a text file
to be folded. If no file operands are specified, the
standard input shall be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDIN <br>
The standard input shall be used if no file operands are
specified, and shall be used if a file operand is
&rsquo;&acirc;&rsquo; and the implementation treats the
&rsquo;&acirc;&rsquo; as meaning standard input. <br>
Otherwise, the standard input shall not be used. See the
INPUT FILES section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUT FILES <br>
If the &acirc;b option is specified, the input files shall
be text files except that the lines are not limited to
{LINE_MAX} bytes in length. If the &acirc;b option is not
specified, the <br>
input files shall be text files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
The following environment variables shall affect the
execution of fold:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LANG Provide a default value for
the internationalization variables that are unset or null.
(See the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008,
Section 8.2, Internationaliza&acirc; <br>
tion Variables for the precedence of internationalization
variables used to determine the values of locale
categories.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_ALL If set to a non-empty
string value, override the values of all the other
internationalization variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_CTYPE Determine the locale
for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text data as
characters (for example, single-byte as opposed to
multi-byte characters in arguments <br>
and input files), and for the determination of the width in
column positions each character would occupy on a
constant-width font output device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_MESSAGES <br>
Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
standard error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NLSPATH Determine the location
of message catalogs for the processing of LC_MESSAGES.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDOUT <br>
The standard output shall be a file containing a sequence of
characters whose order shall be preserved from the input
files, possibly with inserted &lt;newline&gt;
characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDERR <br>
The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT FILES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTENDED DESCRIPTION <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The following exit values shall be returned:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 All input files were processed
successfully.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following sections are
informative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">APPLICATION USAGE <br>
The cut and fold utilities can be used to create text files
out of files with arbitrary line lengths. The cut utility
should be used when the number of lines (or records) needs
<br>
to remain constant. The fold utility should be used when the
contents of long lines need to be kept contiguous.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The fold utility is frequently
used to send text files to printers that truncate, rather
than fold, lines wider than the printer is able to print
(usually 80 or 132 column posi&acirc; <br>
tions).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
An example invocation that submits a file of possibly long
lines to the printer (under the assumption that the user
knows the line width of the printer to be assigned by
lp):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fold &acirc;w 132 bigfile |
lp</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RATIONALE <br>
Although terminal input in canonical processing mode
requires the erase character (frequently set to
&lt;backspace&gt;) to erase the previous character (not byte
or column position), <br>
terminal output is not buffered and is extremely difficult,
if not impossible, to parse correctly; the interpretation
depends entirely on the physical device that actually
dis&acirc; <br>
plays/prints/stores the output. In all known
internationalized implementations, the utilities producing
output for mixed column-width output assume that a
&lt;backspace&gt; character <br>
backs up one column position and outputs enough
&lt;backspace&gt; characters to return to the start of the
character when &lt;backspace&gt; is used to provide local
line motions to support <br>
underlining and emboldening operations. Since fold without
the &acirc;b option is dealing with these same constraints,
&lt;backspace&gt; is always treated as backing up one column
position <br>
rather than backing up one character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Historical versions of the fold
utility assumed 1 byte was one character and occupied one
column position when written out. This is no longer always
true. Since the most common <br>
usage of fold is believed to be folding long lines for
output to limited-length output devices, this capability was
preserved as the default case. The &acirc;b option was added
so that <br>
applications could fold files with arbitrary length lines
into text files that could then be processed by the standard
utilities. Note that although the width for the &acirc;b
option <br>
is in bytes, a line is never split in the middle of a
character. (It is unspecified what happens if a width is
specified that is too small to hold a single character found
in <br>
the input followed by a &lt;newline&gt;.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The tab stops are hardcoded to
be every eighth column to meet historical practice. No new
method of specifying other tab stops was invented.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FUTURE DIRECTIONS <br>
None.</p>
