<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
style - analyse surface characteristics of a document</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
style [-L language] [-l length] [-r ari] [file...] <br>
style [--language language] [--print-long length]
[--print-ari ari] [file...] <br>
style -h|--help <br>
style --version</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Style analyses the surface characteristics of the writing
style of a document. It prints various readability grades,
length of words, sentences and paragraphs. It can further
<br>
locate sentences with certain characteristics. If no files
are given, the document is read from standard input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Numbers are counted as words
with one syllable. A sentence is a sequence of words, that
starts with a capitalised word and ends with a full stop,
double colon, question mark or <br>
exclamation mark. A single letter followed by a dot is
considered an abbreviation, so it does not end a sentence.
Various multi-letter abbreviations are recognized, they do
not <br>
end a sentence as well. A paragraph consists of two or more
new line characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Readability grades <br>
Style understands cpp(1) #line lines for being able to give
precise locations when printing sentences.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Kincaid formula <br>
The Kincaid Formula was developed for U.S. Navy training
manuals; it ranges in difficulty from 5.5 to 16.3. It is
probably best applied to technical documents, because it
<br>
is based on adult training manuals rather than school book
text. Dialogs (often found in fictional texts) are usually a
series of short sentences, which lowers the score. <br>
On the other hand, scientific texts with many long
scientific terms are rated higher, although they are not
necessarily harder to read for people who are familiar with
<br>
those terms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Kincaid =
11.8*syllables/wds+0.39*wds/sentences-15.59</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Automated Readability Index <br>
The Automated Readability Index is typically higher than
Kincaid and Coleman-Liau, but lower than Flesch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ARI =
4.71*chars/wds+0.5*wds/sentences-21.43</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Coleman-Liau Formula <br>
The Coleman-Liau Formula usually gives a lower grade than
Kincaid, ARI and Flesch when applied to technical
documents.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Coleman-Liau =
5.88*chars/wds-29.5*sent/wds-15.8</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Flesch Reading Ease formula <br>
Developed by Rudolph Flesch in 1948, the Flesch Reading Ease
formula is based on school texts covering grades 3 to 12. It
is widespread, especially in the USA, because it <br>
is computed easily and produces good results. The index
ranges from 0 (hard) to 100 (easy). Standard English
documents average around 60 to 70. Applying it to German
<br>
documents gives bad results because of the different
language structure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Flesch Index =
206.835-84.6*syll/wds-1.015*wds/sent</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fog Index <br>
The Fog index was developed by Robert Gunning. Its value is
a school grade. The &acirc;ideal&acirc; Fog Index level is 7
or 8. A level above 12 indicates the writing sample is too
<br>
hard for most people to read. Texts less than 100 words will
not produce meaningful results. Note that a correct
implementation would not count words of three or more <br>
syllables that are proper names, combinations of easy words,
or made three syllables by suffixes such as &acirc;ed,
&acirc;es, or &acirc;ing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fog Index =
0.4*(wds/sent+100*((wds &gt;= 3 syll)/wds))</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Lix formula <br>
The Lix formula developed by Bj&Atilde;&para;rnsson from
Sweden is very simple and employs a mapping table as
well:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Lix = wds/sent+100*(wds &gt;= 6
char)/wds</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Index 34 38 41 44 48 51 54 57
<br>
School year 5 6 7 8 9 10 11</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SMOG Grading <br>
The SMOG Grading for English texts was developed by
McLaughlin in 1969. Its result is a school grade.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SMOG Grading = square root of
(((wds &gt;= 3 syll)/sent)*30) + 3</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It was adapted to German by
Bamberger and Vanecek in 1984, who changed the constant +3
to -2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Word usage <br>
The word usage counts are intended to help identify
excessive use of particular parts of speech.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Verb Phrases <br>
The category of verbs labeled &quot;to be&quot; identifies
phrases using the passive voice. Use the passive voice
sparingly, in favor of more direct verb forms. The flag -p
causes <br>
style to list all occurrences of the passive voice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The verb category
&quot;aux&quot; measures the use of modal auxiliary verbs,
such as &quot;can&quot;, &quot;could&quot;, and
&quot;should&quot;. Modal auxiliary verbs modify the mood of
a verb.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Conjunctions <br>
The conjunctions counted by style are coordinating and
subordinating. Coordinating conjunctions join grammatically
equal sentence fragments, such as a noun with a noun, a <br>
phrase with a phrase, or a clause to a clause. Coordinating
conjunctions are &quot;and,&quot; &quot;but,&quot;
&quot;or,&quot; &quot;yet,&quot; and &quot;nor.&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Subordinating conjunctions
connect clauses of unequal status. A subordinating
conjunction links a subordinate clause, which is unable to
stand alone, to an independent clause. <br>
Examples of subordinating conjunctions are
&quot;because,&quot; &quot;although,&quot; and &quot;even
if.&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pronouns <br>
Pronouns are contextual references to nouns and noun
phrases. Documents with few pronouns generally lack
cohesiveness and fluidity. Too many pronouns may indicate
ambi&acirc; <br>
guity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Nominalizations <br>
Nominalizations are verbs that are changed to nouns. Style
recognizes words that end in &quot;ment,&quot;
&quot;ance,&quot; &quot;ence,&quot; or &quot;ion&quot; as
nominalizations. Examples are &quot;endowment,&quot; <br>
&quot;admittance,&quot; and &quot;nominalization.&quot; Too
much nominalization in a document can sound abstract and be
difficult to understand. The flag -N causes style to list
all nomi&acirc; <br>
nalizations. The flag -n prints all sentences with either
the passive voice or a nominalization.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-L language, --language language <br>
set the document language (de, en, nl).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l length, --print-long length
<br>
print all sentences longer than length words.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r ari, --print-ari ari <br>
print all sentences whose readability index (ARI) is greater
than ari.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p passive, --print-passive <br>
print all sentences phrased in the passive voice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N nominalizations, --print-nom
<br>
print all sentences containing nominalizations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n nominalizations-passive,
--print-nom-passive <br>
print all sentences phrased in the passive voice or
containing nominalizations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Print a short usage message.</p>

Print the version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ERRORS <br>

of memory is signalled by exit code 2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>

language is en.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_CTYPE=iso-8859-1 <br>

There has been a style command on old UNIX systems, which is
now part of the AT&amp;T DWB package. The original version
was bound to roff by enforcing a call to deroff.</p>
