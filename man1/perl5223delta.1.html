perl5223delta - what is new for perl v5.22.3
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
This document describes differences between the 5.22.2 release and the 5.22.3
  release.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.22.1, first read
  perl5222delta, which describes differences between 5.22.1 and 5.22.2.

<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="-Di_switch_is_now_required_for_PerlIO_debugging_output"><a class="selflink" href="#-Di_switch_is_now_required_for_PerlIO_debugging_output"><b>-Di</b>
  switch is now required for PerlIO debugging output</a></h2>
Previously PerlIO debugging output would be sent to the file specified by the
  &quot;PERLIO_DEBUG&quot; environment variable if perl wasn't running setuid
  and the <b>-T</b> or <b>-t</b> switches hadn't been parsed yet.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If perl performed output at a point where it hadn't yet parsed its switches this
  could result in perl creating or overwriting the file named by
  &quot;PERLIO_DEBUG&quot; even when the <b>-T</b> switch had been supplied.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Perl now requires the <b>-Di</b> switch to produce PerlIO debugging output. By
  default this is written to &quot;stderr&quot;, but can optionally be
  redirected to a file by setting the &quot;PERLIO_DEBUG&quot; environment
  variable.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If perl is running setuid or the <b>-T</b> switch was supplied
  &quot;PERLIO_DEBUG&quot; is ignored and the debugging output is sent to
  &quot;stderr&quot; as for any other <b>-D</b> switch.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Core_modules_and_tools_no_longer_search_&quot;.&quot;_for_optional_modules"><a class="selflink" href="#Core_modules_and_tools_no_longer_search_&quot;.&quot;_for_optional_modules">Core
  modules and tools no longer search <i>&quot;.&quot;</i> for optional
  modules</a></h2>
The tools and many modules supplied in core no longer search the default current
  directory entry in @INC for optional modules. For example, Storable will
  remove the final <i>&quot;.&quot;</i> from @INC before trying to load
  Log::Agent.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This prevents an attacker injecting an optional module into a process run by
  another user where the current directory is writable by the attacker, e.g. the
  <i>/tmp</i> directory.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In most cases this removal should not cause problems, but difficulties were
  encountered with base, which treats every module name supplied as optional.
  These difficulties have not yet been resolved, so for this release there are
  no changes to base. We hope to have a fix for base in Perl 5.22.4.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To protect your own code from this attack, either remove the default
  <i>&quot;.&quot;</i> entry from @INC at the start of your script, so:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  #!/usr/bin/perl
  use strict;
  ...
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
becomes:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  #!/usr/bin/perl
  BEGIN { pop @INC if $INC[-1] eq '.' }
  use strict;
  ...
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
or for modules, remove <i>&quot;.&quot;</i> from a localized @INC, so:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  my $can_foo = eval { require Foo; }
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
becomes:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  my $can_foo = eval {
      local @INC = @INC;
      pop @INC if $INC[-1] eq '.';
      require Foo;
  };
</pre>

Perl 5.22.3 represents approximately 9 months of development since Perl 5.22.2
  and contains approximately 4,400 lines of changes across 240 files from 20
  authors.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Excluding auto-generated files, documentation and release tools, there were
  approximately 2,200 lines of changes to 170 .pm, .t, .c and .h files.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Perl continues to flourish into its third decade thanks to a vibrant community
  of users and developers. The following people are known to have contributed
  the improvements that became Perl 5.22.3:
<div class="Pp"></div>
Aaron Crane, Abigail, Alex Vandiver, Aristotle Pagaltzis, Chad Granum, Chris
  'BinGOs' Williams, Craig A. Berry, David Mitchell, Father Chrysostomos, James
  E Keenan, Jarkko Hietaniemi, Karen Etheridge, Karl Williamson, Matthew
  Horsfall, Niko Tyni, Ricardo Signes, Sawyer X, Stevan Little, Steve Hay, Tony
  Cook.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is automatically generated
  from version control history. In particular, it does not include the names of
  the (very much appreciated) contributors who reported issues to the Perl bug
  tracker.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Many of the changes included in this version originated in the CPAN modules
  included in Perl's core. We're grateful to the entire CPAN community for
  helping Perl to flourish.

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently
  posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the Perl bug database at
  https://rt.perl.org/ . There may also be information at http://www.perl.org/ ,
  the Perl Home Page.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug program
  included with your release. Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
  sufficient test case. Your bug report, along with the output of &quot;perl
  -V&quot;, will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl
  porting team.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it
  inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send it
  to perl5-security-report@perl.org. This points to a closed subscription
  unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core committers, who will be
  able to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help
  co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all
  platforms on which Perl is supported. Please only use this address for
  security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently distributed on
  CPAN.
