<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
qodem - Qodem Terminal Emulator</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
qodem [ --enable-capture FILENAME ] <br>
[ [ --connect HOST [ --connect-method method ] <br>
[ --username name ] ] | <br>
args... ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">qodem [ --help | -h | -? ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Qodem is an open-source clone implementation of the popular
DOS-based Qmodem serial communications program. Qodem
incorporates many features that are useful on all kinds of
<br>
text-based consoles such as scrollback buffer, session
capture, screen dump, dialing directory, and also includes
serial port handling and modem dialing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The major features of Qodem
are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Unicode display: translation
of CP437 (PC VGA), VT100 DEC Special <br>
Graphics characters, VT220 National Replacement Character
sets, <br>
etc., to Unicode</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Terminal interface
conveniences: scrollback buffer, capture file, <br>
screen dump, dialing directory, keyboard macros, script
support</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Connection methods: serial,
local shell, command line, telnet, <br>
ssh, rlogin, rsh</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Emulations: ANSI, Avatar,
VT52, VT100/102, VT220, Linux, and XTerm</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Transfer protocols: Xmodem,
Ymodem, Zmodem, and Kermit</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TERMINAL REQUIREMENTS <br>
Qodem requires the following characteristics of its
shell/terminal:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Unicode capability. The raw
Linux console, UXTerm, URxvt, <br>
Konsole, and gnome-terminal all work well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* A Unicode font that includes
the CP437 (PC VGA) glyphs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The meta key must use escape
prefixing rather than setting the 8th <br>
bit on the character. Many terminal emulators do this by
<br>
default. Qodem sends an xterm escape sequence to enable this
<br>
behavior. For XTerm, this can be enabled by clicking <br>
CTRL-Mouse1 (left button) and checking &quot;Meta Sends
Escape&quot;, or by <br>
adding the following lines to ~/.Xresources: <br>
XTerm*metaSendsEscape: true <br>
UXTerm*metaSendsEscape: true</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EMULATIONS <br>
Emulations supported by Qodem and their status follows. Note
that TTY, DEBUG, ANSI.SYS, AVATAR, LINUX, and XTERM
emulations can use both CP437 (PC VGA) and ISO-8859-1 glyphs
for <br>
8-bit characters (see Alt-; Codepage below). If ISO-8859-1
is used, the C0 control characters (0x00 - 0x1F) are mapped
to the equivalent CP437 glyphs since there are no glyphs
<br>
defined in that range for ISO-8859-1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ANSI This is the DOS-based
&quot;ANSI.SYS&quot; emulation plus a few more codes than
the original ANSI.SYS. It supports DSR 6 (Cursor Position)
which many BBSes used to &quot;autodetect&quot; <br>
ANSI, and the following ANSI X3.64 functions: ICH, DCH, IL,
DL, VPA, CHA, CHT, and REP. It also supports &quot;ANSI
Music&quot; sequences that follow the &quot;PLAY&quot;
command syntax; it <br>
plays these tones via SDL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AVATAR This is the BBS-era
Avatar (&quot;Advanced Video Attribute Terminal Assembler
and Recreator&quot;) emulation. It supports all of the
&quot;Extended AVT/0&quot; commands as per George A. <br>
Stanislav&rsquo;s 1 May 1989 document except for
transmitting PC keyboard scan codes. It also includes ANSI
fallback capability.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VT52 Fairly complete. Does not
support HOLD SCREEN mode. Graphics mode glyphs that do not
have direct Unicode equivalents render as a hatch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VT100 Identical to VT102 except
in how it responds to Device Attributes function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VT102 Fairly complete.
Double-width characters are not displayed with wide glyhps
due to curses-based output. Does not support smooth
scrolling, printing, keyboard locking, <br>
keyboard leds, and hardware tests. Many numeric keypad
characters also do not work correctly due to console NUM
LOCK handling. 132-column output is only supported if the
<br>
host console / window is already 132 columns or wider; Qodem
does not issue resize commands to the host console for
80/132 column switching codes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VT220 Fairly complete. Converts
National Replacement Character sets and DEC Supplemental
Graphics characters to Unicode. In addition to limitations
of VT102, also the follow&acirc; <br>
ing features are not supported: user-defined keys (DECUDK),
downloadable fonts (DECDLD), VT100/ANSI compatibility mode
(DECSCL).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TTY This emulation supports bare
control character handling (backspace, newline, etc.) and
litte else. Characters that would be overwritten with
underscores are instead made <br>
underlined as old teletypes would do.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEBUG This emulation displays
all incoming characters in a format similar to a hex
dump.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LINUX This emulation has two
modes: PC VGA (LINUX) and UTF-8 (L_UTF8). This emulation is
similar to VT102 but also recognizes the Linux private mode
sequences and ECMA-48 <br>
sequences VPA, CNL, CPL, ECH, CHA, VPA, VPR, and HPA. In
addition to VT102 limitations, also the following features
are not supported: selecting ISO 646/ISO 8859-1/UTF-8 <br>
character sets, X11 mouse reporting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">XTERM This emulation has two
modes: PC VGA (XTERM) and UTF-8 (X_UTF8). It is mostly
identical to LINUX but also recognizes a few XTerm sequences
and discards them to maintain a <br>
clean display. It does not support many of the features
unique to XTerm such as Tektronix 4014 mode, mouse tracking,
alternate screen buffer, and many more.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILE TRANSFER PROTOCOLS <br>
Protocols supported by Qodem and their status follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">XMODEM Supports original Xmodem,
Xmodem-1k, Xmodem-CRC16, and Xmodem-G. Also supports
&quot;Xmodem Relaxed&quot;, a variant of original Xmodem
with longer timeouts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">YMODEM Supports Ymodem and
Ymodem-G. If a file exists, it will be appended to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ZMODEM Supports resume (crash
recovery) and auto-start. Does not yet support changing
block size on errors, so transfers over unreliable
serial/modem connections might incur <br>
significant performance penalties.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KERMIT Supports the original
robust (slow) Kermit plus streaming and autostart. On
reliable connections with streaming it should perform
reasonably well. Does not yet support <br>
long or extra-long packets, RESEND/REGET, server mode, or
sliding windows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INTERFACE <br>
Phonebook <br>
When qodem first starts up, by default it will start in the
phonebook. The menu on the bottom half of the screen lists
the various actions available. When editing a phonebook <br>
entry, the status line will change to show options for each
field. Connecting to a system or leaving the phonebook puts
qodem in Terminal Mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Terminal Mode <br>
Terminal Mode is the main qodem terminal emulator interface.
Alt-Z will bring up a help menu. While in Terminal Mode the
following actions are supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alt-D Phonebook <br>
This brings up the phonebook.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alt-G Term Emulation <br>
This brings up a menu to select the terminal emulation.
Selecting the active terminal emulation will prompt to reset
the emulation state; this may be useful to recover <br>
from corrupted escape sequences.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alt-C Clear Screen <br>
This clears the screen and homes the cursor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alt-F Execute Script <br>
This prompts for a filename, and then executes that file as
a script. Any program that reads from standard input and
writes to standard output can be run as a script. <br>
See the section below on script support.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alt-K Send BREAK <br>
When connected via serial mode or modem, this calls
tcsendbreak() to send a true &quot;Break Signal&quot; on the
serial line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alt-P Capture File <br>
Enable/disable capture to file. Three capture formats are
supported: &quot;raw&quot;, &quot;text&quot;, and
&quot;html&quot;. &quot;Raw&quot; format saves every byte as
received from the other side before emu&acirc; <br>
lation processing; &quot;text&quot; saves UTF-8 characters
after emulation processing; &quot;html&quot; saves in HTML
format with Unicode entities and color attributes after
emulation pro&acirc; <br>
cessing. ASCII file transfers will be included in the
capture file; other file transfers (Xmodem, Ymodem, Zmodem,
Kermit) are excluded from the capture file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alt-S Split Screen <br>
This actives split screen mode, in which local characters
are accumulated in a buffer before sending to the remote
side. To send carriage return, enter &quot;^M&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alt-T Screen Dump <br>
This prompts for a filename, and then saves the current view
to that file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alt-Y COM Parameters <br>
This brings up a menu to alter the serial port settings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PgUp Upload Files <br>
This brings up the file upload menu. Note that CTRL-PgUp and
ALT-PgUp may also work depending on the terminfo for the
host terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PgDn Download Files <br>
This brings up the file download menu. Note that CTRL-PgDn
and ALT-PgDn may also work depending on the terminfo for the
host terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alt-&nbsp;Compose Key <br>
This brings up a dialog to enter the 3-digit decimal value
(0-255) for an 8-bit byte or a 4-digit hexadecimal value
(0-ffff) for a 16-bit Unicode character (L_UTF8 and <br>
X_UTF8 only).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alt-; Codepage <br>
This brings up a dialog to change the current codepage.
Codepages are limited by the current emulation. VT52, VT100,
VT102, VT220, L_UTF8, and X_UTF8 can only be set to <br>
the DEC codepage; LINUX, XTERM, ANSI, AVATAR, TTY, and DEBUG
emulations can be set to either CP437 (VGA) or
ISO-8859-1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alt-/ Scroll Back <br>
This selects the scrollback buffer. When viewing the buffer,
&quot;S&quot; saves to file and &quot;C&quot; clears the
scrollback buffer. By default qodem supports up to 20000
lines of <br>
scrollback; this can be changed by editing scrollback_max in
scrollback.c.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alt-H Hangup/Close <br>
This hangs up the modem (drops DTR) or closes the remote
connection (kills the child process).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alt-L Log View <br>
This brings the session log up in an editor. The session log
stores information about connect, disconnect, and file
upload/download events.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alt-M Mail Reader <br>
This spawns the mail reader, by default mm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alt-X Exit Qodem <br>
This prompts to exit qodem. When not connected, Ctrl-C will
also bring up the exit prompt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alt-A Translate Table <br>
This brings up the translate table editor. Both incoming and
outgoing bytes can be changed or stripped (set to ASCII NUL
(0)). Note that translation occurs before both <br>
emulation processing and UTF-8 decoding.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alt-J Function Keys <br>
This brings up the keyboard macro editor. Keyboard macros
support substitutions for carriage return (&quot;^M&quot;),
the phonebook entry username (&quot;$USERNAME&quot;), and
the phonebook <br>
entry password (&quot;$PASSWORD&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alt-N Configuration <br>
This brings the qodemrc options file up in an editor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alt-O Modem Config <br>
This brings up the modem configuration dialog.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alt-R OS Shell <br>
This spawns a system shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alt-V View File <br>
This brings up a prompt to view a file in an editor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alt-W List Directory <br>
This brings up a directory listing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alt-0 Session Log <br>
This toggles the session log on or off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alt-1 XON/XOFF Flow Ctrl <br>
When connected via modem or serial port, this toggles
XON/XOFF on or off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alt-2 Backspace/Del Mode <br>
This selects whether the backspace key on the keyboard sends
an ASCII backspace (^H) or an ASCII DEL (127) character.
Ctrl-H can always be used to send true backspace; <br>
Ctrl-? can be used to send true DEL. Note that VT220
emulation always sends DEL when the backspace key is
pressed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alt-3 Line Wrap <br>
This toggles line wrap mode on or off. When line wrap mode
is enabled, if a character is received when the cursor is at
the right margin it will wrap to the first column <br>
of the next line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alt-4 Display NULL <br>
This selects whether ASCII NUL (0) will be displayed as a
blank/space or stripped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alt-6 Batch Entry Window <br>
This brings up the list of upload files used by Ymodem,
Zmodem, and Kermit uploads.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alt-7 Status Line Info <br>
This selects between two formats for the status line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alt-8 Hi-Bit Strip <br>
This selects whether or not to clear the 8th bit of all
incoming bytes. Note that high-bit stripping occurs before
both emulation processing and UTF-8 decoding.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alt-9 Serial Port <br>
This opens or closes the serial port. If already connected
to a non-serial/modem remote host, this does nothing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alt-B Beeps &amp; Bells <br>
This toggles beep support on or off. When beep support is
on, beeps from the remote host will be played by qodem. In
LINUX emulation, qodem supports setting the tone and <br>
duration of the beep as specified in console-codes(4).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alt-E Half/Full Duplex <br>
This toggles between half and full duplex.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alt-I Qodem Information <br>
This displays the qodem splash screen which includes the
version and build date.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alt-U Scrollback Record <br>
This selects whether or not lines that scroll off the top of
the screen will be saved to the scrollback buffer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alt-= Doorway Mode <br>
This selects between three doorway modes: &quot;Doorway
OFF&quot;, &quot;Doorway MIXED&quot; and &quot;Doorway
FULL&quot;. When doorway mode is &quot;Doorway OFF&quot;,
terminal mode responds to all of its com&acirc; <br>
mand keys as described in this section. When doorway mode is
&quot;Doorway FULL&quot;, all Alt- command keystrokes except
Alt-= are passed to the remote side. When doorway mode is
<br>
&quot;Doorway MIXED&quot;, terminal mode supports a few
commands but passes the majority of Alt- command keystrokes
to the remote side. The default commands supported in
&quot;Doorway <br>
MIXED&quot; mode are: <br>
Alt-D Phonebook <br>
Alt-P Capture <br>
Alt-T Screen Dump <br>
Alt-Y COM Parameters <br>
Alt-Z Menu <br>
Alt-/ Scrollback <br>
Alt-PgUp or Ctrl-PgUp Upload Files <br>
Alt-PgDn or Ctrl-PgDn Download Files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alt-- Status Lines <br>
This toggles the status line on or off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alt-+ CR/CRLF Mode <br>
This toggles whether or not received carriage returns imply
line feed or not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alt-, ANSI Music <br>
This toggles ANSI music support on or off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UNICODE SUPPORT <br>
Qodem supports Unicode (UTF-8 encoding only) in the
following functions only: keyboard macros; phonebook entries
(NAME, USERNAME, and PASSWORD); modem device name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UTF-8 is NOT supported in
filenames, modem strings, and remote addresses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SCRIPT SUPPORT <br>
Qodem does not have its own scripting language. Instead, any
program that reads and writes to the standard input and
output can be run as a Qodem script:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Characters sent from the
remote connection are visible to the <br>
script in its standard input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Characters the script emits to
its standard output are passed on <br>
the remote connection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Messages to the standard error
are reported to the user and also <br>
recorded in the session log.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since scripts are communicating
with the remote system and not Qodem itself, they are unable
to script Qodem&rsquo;s behavior, e.g. change the terminal
emulation, hangup and dial <br>
another phonebook entry, download a file, etc. However, they
can be written in any language, and they can be tested
outside Qodem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Scripts replace the user, and as
such have similar constraints:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Script standard input, output,
and error must all be in UTF-8 encoding. )</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Scripts should send carriage
return (0x0D, or instead of new <br>
line (0x0A, or 0 to the remote side - the same as if a user
<br>
pressed the Enter key. They should expect to see either bare
) or carriage return <br>
carriage return (0x0D, or followed by 0 from the remote
side. <br>
newline (0x0D 0x0A, or</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Input and output translate
byte translation (the Alt-A Translate Tables) are honored
for scripts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* While a script is running:
<br>
- Zmodem and Kermit autostart are disabled. <br>
- Keyboard function key macros are disabled. <br>
- Qodem functions accessed through the Alt-character <br>
combinations and PgUp/PgDn are unavailable. <br>
- Pressing Alt-P will pause the script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* While a script is paused: <br>
- The script will receive nothing on its standard input.
<br>
- Anything in the script&rsquo;s standard output will be
held until <br>
the script is resumed. <br>
- The script process will not be signaled; it may continue
<br>
running in its own process. <br>
- The only Alt-character function recognized is AltP to <br>
resume the script. All other Alt- keys will be ignored. <br>
- Keys pressed will be sent directly to the remote system.
<br>
- Keyboard function key macros will work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Scripts are launched in two
ways:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* In TERMINAL mode, press Alt-F
and enter the script filename. The <br>
script will start immediately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* In the phonebook, add a script
filename to a phonebook entry. The <br>
script will start once that entry is connected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Script command-line arguments
can be passed directly in both the Alt-F script dialog and
the phonebook linked script field. For example, pressing
Alt-F and entering <br>
&quot;my_script.pl arg1&quot; will launch my_script.pl and
with its first command-line argument ($ARGV[0] in Perl) set
to &quot;arg1&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
--enable-capture FILENAME <br>
Capture the entire session and save to FILENAME.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--connect HOST <br>
Immediately open a connection to HOST. The default
connection method is &quot;ssh&quot; unless specified with
the --connect-method option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--connect-method METHOD <br>
Use METHOD to connect for the --connect and --dial options.
Valid values are &quot;ssh&quot;, &quot;rlogin&quot;,
&quot;rsh&quot;, &quot;telnet&quot;, and
&quot;shell&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--username USERNAME <br>
Use USERNAME when connecting with the --connect option. This
value is passed on the command line to ssh, rsh, and
rlogin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">args... <br>
Spawn a local shell and pass args to it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help, -h, -? <br>
Display usage screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
Qodem makes use of the following variables:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOME The user&rsquo;s home
directory. Qodem creates two directories: $HOME/.qodem for
qodem&rsquo;s internal files (phonebook, keyboard macro
files, translate tables, etc.) and <br>
$HOME/qodem for uploaded and downloaded files, session log,
capture, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EDITOR If present, this will be
used when spawning external editors (log view, edit
configuration, view file, edit phonebook note). If not
present, by default (editable in the <br>
options file) use vi.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ESCDELAY <br>
This is a timeout value in milliseconds used by the ncurses
get_wch() and wget_wch() functions to determine if a user
pressed bare ESCAPE. On some systems pressing ESCAPE <br>
may require up to a full second before qodem can process it.
For qodem backtick (&lsquo;) can be used instead of
ESCAPE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
$HOME/.qodem/qodemrc <br>
Qodem options/configuration file. Inline comments describe
the options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
xqodem(1), mm(1), kermit(1), gkermit(1), minicom(1),
rlogin(1), rsh(1), ssh(1), telnet(1), xterm(1), vttest(1),
console-codes(4)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
The screensaver might not load under all circumstances even
after the timeout has passed.</p>
