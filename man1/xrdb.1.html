<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
xrdb - X server resource database utility</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
xrdb [-option ...] [filename]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Xrdb is used to get or set the contents of the
RESOURCE_MANAGER property on the root window of screen 0, or
the SCREEN_RESOURCES property on the root window of any or
all <br>
screens, or everything combined. You would normally run this
program from your X startup file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most X clients use the
RESOURCE_MANAGER and SCREEN_RESOURCES properties to get user
preferences about color, fonts, and so on for applications.
Having this information in the <br>
server (where it is available to all clients) instead of on
disk, solves the problem in previous versions of X that
required you to maintain defaults files on every machine
that <br>
you might use. It also allows for dynamic changing of
defaults without editing files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The RESOURCE_MANAGER property is
used for resources that apply to all screens of the display.
The SCREEN_RESOURCES property on each screen specifies
additional (or overriding) <br>
resources to be used for that screen. (When there is only
one screen, SCREEN_RESOURCES is normally not used, all
resources are just placed in the RESOURCE_MANAGER
property.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The file specified by filename
(or the contents from standard input if - or no filename is
given) is optionally passed through the C preprocessor with
the following symbols <br>
defined, based on the capabilities of the server being
used:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SERVERHOST=hostname <br>
the hostname portion of the display to which you are
connected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SRVR_name <br>
the SERVERHOST hostname string turned into a legal
identifier. For example, &quot;my-dpy.lcs.mit.edu&quot;
becomes SRVR_my_dpy_lcs_mit_edu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOST=hostname <br>
the same as SERVERHOST.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DISPLAY_NUM=num <br>
the number of the display on the server host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CLIENTHOST=hostname <br>
the name of the host on which xrdb is running.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CLNT_name <br>
the CLIENTHOST hostname string turned into a legal
identifier. For example, &quot;expo.lcs.mit.edu&quot;
becomes CLNT_expo_lcs_mit_edu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RELEASE=num <br>
the vendor release number for the server. The interpretation
of this number will vary depending on VENDOR.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REVISION=num <br>
the X protocol minor version supported by this server
(currently 0).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VERSION=num <br>
the X protocol major version supported by this server
(should always be 11).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VENDOR=&quot;vendor&quot; <br>
a string literal specifying the vendor of the server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VNDR_name <br>
the VENDOR name string turned into a legal identifier. For
example, &quot;MIT X Consortium&quot; becomes
VNDR_MIT_X_Consortium.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXT_name <br>
A symbol is defined for each protocol extension supported by
the server. Each extension string name is turned into a
legal identifier. For example, &quot;X3D-PEX&quot; becomes
<br>
EXT_X3D_PEX.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NUM_SCREENS=num <br>
the total number of screens.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SCREEN_NUM=num <br>
the number of the current screen (from zero).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BITS_PER_RGB=num <br>
the number of significant bits in an RGB color
specification. This is the log base 2 of the number of
distinct shades of each primary that the hardware can
generate. <br>
Note that it usually is not related to PLANES.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CLASS=visualclass <br>
one of StaticGray, GrayScale, StaticColor, PseudoColor,
TrueColor, DirectColor. This is the visual class of the root
window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CLASS_visualclass=visualid <br>
the visual class of the root window in a form you can #ifdef
on. The value is the numeric id of the visual.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COLOR defined only if CLASS is
one of StaticColor, PseudoColor, TrueColor, or
DirectColor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CLASS_visualclass_depth=num <br>
A symbol is defined for each visual supported for the
screen. The symbol includes the class of the visual and its
depth; the value is the numeric id of the visual. (If <br>
more than one visual has the same class and depth, the
numeric id of the first one reported by the server is
used.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HEIGHT=num <br>
the height of the root window in pixels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WIDTH=num <br>
the width of the root window in pixels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PLANES=num <br>
the number of bit planes (the depth) of the root window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">X_RESOLUTION=num <br>
the x resolution of the screen in pixels per meter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Y_RESOLUTION=num <br>
the y resolution of the screen in pixels per meter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SRVR_name, CLNT_name, VNDR_name,
and EXT_name identifiers are formed by changing all
characters other than letters and digits into underscores
(_).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Lines that begin with an
exclamation mark (!) are ignored and may be used as
comments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that since xrdb can read
from standard input, it can be used to the change the
contents of properties directly from a terminal or from a
shell script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
xrdb program accepts the following options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-help This option (or any
unsupported option) will cause a brief description of the
allowable options and parameters to be printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-version <br>
This option will cause the xrdb version to be printed and
the program to exit without performing any other
operations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-display display <br>
This option specifies the X server to be used; see X(7). It
also specifies the screen to use for the -screen option, and
it specifies the screen from which preprocessor <br>
symbols are derived for the -global option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-all This option indicates that
operation should be performed on the screen-independent
resource property (RESOURCE_MANAGER), as well as the
screen-specific property <br>
(SCREEN_RESOURCES) on every screen of the display. For
example, when used in conjunction with -query, the contents
of all properties are output. For -load, -override <br>
and -merge, the input file is processed once for each
screen. The resources which occur in common in the output
for every screen are collected, and these are applied as
<br>
the screen-independent resources. The remaining resources
are applied for each individual per-screen property. This
the default mode of operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-global This option indicates
that the operation should only be performed on the
screen-independent RESOURCE_MANAGER property.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-screen This option indicates
that the operation should only be performed on the
SCREEN_RESOURCES property of the default screen of the
display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-screens <br>
This option indicates that the operation should be performed
on the SCREEN_RESOURCES property of each screen of the
display. For -load, -override and -merge, the input <br>
file is processed for each screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n This option indicates that
changes to the specified properties (when used with -load,
-override or -merge) or to the resource file (when used with
-edit) should be shown <br>
on the standard output, but should not be performed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-quiet This option indicates
that warning about duplicate entries should not be
displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-cpp filename <br>
This option specifies the pathname of the C preprocessor
program to be used. Although xrdb was designed to use CPP,
any program that acts as a filter and accepts the -D, <br>
-I, and -U options may be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nocpp This option indicates
that xrdb should not run the input file through a
preprocessor before loading it into properties.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-undef This option is passed to
the C preprocessor if used. It prevents it from predefining
any system specific macros.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-symbols <br>
This option indicates that the symbols that are defined for
the preprocessor should be printed onto the standard
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-query This option indicates
that the current contents of the specified properties should
be printed onto the standard output. Note that since
preprocessor commands in the <br>
input resource file are part of the input file, not part of
the property, they won&rsquo;t appear in the output from
this option. The -edit option can be used to merge the <br>
contents of properties back into the input resource file
without damaging preprocessor commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-load This option indicates that
the input should be loaded as the new value of the specified
properties, replacing whatever was there (i.e. the old
contents are removed). <br>
This is the default action.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-override <br>
This option indicates that the input should be added to,
instead of replacing, the current contents of the specified
properties. New entries override previous entries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-merge This option indicates
that the input should be merged and lexicographically sorted
with, instead of replacing, the current contents of the
specified properties.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-remove This option indicates
that the specified properties should be removed from the
server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-retain This option indicates
that the server should be instructed not to reset if xrdb is
the first client. This should never be necessary under
normal conditions, since xdm <br>
and xinit always act as the first client.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-edit filename <br>
This option indicates that the contents of the specified
properties should be edited into the given file, replacing
any values already listed there. This allows you to <br>
put changes that you have made to your defaults back into
your resource file, preserving any comments or preprocessor
lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-backup string <br>
This option specifies a suffix to be appended to the
filename used with -edit to generate a backup file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Dname[=value] <br>
This option is passed through to the preprocessor and is
used to define symbols for use with conditionals such as
#ifdef.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Uname This option is passed
through to the preprocessor and is used to remove any
definitions of this symbol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Idirectory <br>
This option is passed through to the preprocessor and is
used to specify a directory to search for files that are
referenced with #include.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
Xrdb does not load any files on its own, but many desktop
environments use xrdb to load ~/.Xresources files on session
startup to initialize the resource database, as a
general&acirc; <br>
ized replacement for ~/.Xdefaults files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
X(7), appres(1), listres(1), Xlib Resource Manager
documentation, Xt resource documentation</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
DISPLAY to figure out which display to use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
The default for no arguments should be to query, not to
overwrite, so that it is consistent with other programs.</p>
