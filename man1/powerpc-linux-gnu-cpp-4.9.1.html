<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
cpp - The C Preprocessor</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
cpp [-Dmacro[=defn]...] [-Umacro] <br>
[-Idir...] [-iquotedir...] <br>
[-Wwarn...] <br>
[-M|-MM] [-MG] [-MF filename] <br>
[-MP] [-MQ target...] <br>
[-MT target...] <br>
[-P] [-fno-working-directory] <br>
[-x language] [-std=standard] <br>
infile outfile</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Only the most useful options are
listed here; see below for the remainder.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The C preprocessor, often known as cpp, is a macro processor
that is used automatically by the C compiler to transform
your program before compilation. It is called a macro <br>
processor because it allows you to define macros, which are
brief abbreviations for longer constructs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The C preprocessor is intended
to be used only with C, C++, and Objective-C source code. In
the past, it has been abused as a general text processor. It
will choke on input <br>
which does not obey C&rsquo;s lexical rules. For example,
apostrophes will be interpreted as the beginning of
character constants, and cause errors. Also, you cannot rely
on it <br>
preserving characteristics of the input which are not
significant to C-family languages. If a Makefile is
preprocessed, all the hard tabs will be removed, and the
Makefile will <br>
not work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Having said that, you can often
get away with using cpp on things which are not C. Other
Algol-ish programming languages are often safe (Pascal, Ada,
etc.) So is assembly, with <br>
caution. -traditional-cpp mode preserves more white space,
and is otherwise more permissive. Many of the problems can
be avoided by writing C or C++ style comments instead of
<br>
native language comments, and keeping macros simple.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Wherever possible, you should
use a preprocessor geared to the language you are writing
in. Modern versions of the GNU assembler have macro
facilities. Most high level <br>
programming languages have their own conditional compilation
and inclusion mechanism. If all else fails, try a true
general text processor, such as GNU M4.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C preprocessors vary in some
details. This manual discusses the GNU C preprocessor, which
provides a small superset of the features of ISO Standard C.
In its default mode, the <br>
GNU C preprocessor does not do a few things required by the
standard. These are features which are rarely, if ever,
used, and may cause surprising changes to the meaning of a
<br>
program which does not expect them. To get strict ISO
Standard C, you should use the -std=c90, -std=c99 or
-std=c11 options, depending on which version of the standard
you want. <br>
To get all the mandatory diagnostics, you must also use
-pedantic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This manual describes the
behavior of the ISO preprocessor. To minimize gratuitous
differences, where the ISO preprocessor&rsquo;s behavior
does not conflict with traditional <br>
semantics, the traditional preprocessor should behave the
same way. The various differences that do exist are detailed
in the section Traditional Mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For clarity, unless noted
otherwise, references to CPP in this manual refer to GNU
CPP.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The C preprocessor expects two file names as arguments,
infile and outfile. The preprocessor reads infile together
with any other files it specifies with #include. All the
<br>
output generated by the combined input files is written in
outfile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Either infile or outfile may be
-, which as infile means to read from standard input and as
outfile means to write to standard output. Also, if either
file is omitted, it means <br>
the same as if - had been specified for that file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unless otherwise noted, or the
option ends in =, all options which take an argument may
have that argument appear either immediately after the
option, or with a space between <br>
option and argument: -Ifoo and -I foo have the same
effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Many options have multi-letter
names; therefore multiple single-letter options may not be
grouped: -dM is very different from -d -M.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D name <br>
Predefine name as a macro, with definition 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D name=definition <br>
The contents of definition are tokenized and processed as if
they appeared during translation phase three in a #define
directive. In particular, the definition will be <br>
truncated by embedded newline characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are invoking the
preprocessor from a shell or shell-like program you may need
to use the shell&rsquo;s quoting syntax to protect
characters such as spaces that have a <br>
meaning in the shell syntax.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you wish to define a
function-like macro on the command line, write its argument
list with surrounding parentheses before the equals sign (if
any). Parentheses are <br>
meaningful to most shells, so you will need to quote the
option. With sh and csh,
-D&rsquo;name(args...)=definition&rsquo; works.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D and -U options are processed
in the order they are given on the command line. All
-imacros file and -include file options are processed after
all -D and -U options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U name <br>
Cancel any previous definition of name, either built in or
provided with a -D option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-undef <br>
Do not predefine any system-specific or GCC-specific macros.
The standard predefined macros remain defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I dir <br>
Add the directory dir to the list of directories to be
searched for header files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Directories named by -I are
searched before the standard system include directories. If
the directory dir is a standard system include directory,
the option is ignored to <br>
ensure that the default search order for system directories
and the special treatment of system headers are not defeated
. If dir begins with &quot;=&quot;, then the &quot;=&quot;
will be <br>
replaced by the sysroot prefix; see --sysroot and
-isysroot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o file <br>
Write output to file. This is the same as specifying file as
the second non-option argument to cpp. gcc has a different
interpretation of a second non-option argument, so <br>
you must use -o to specify the output file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wall <br>
Turns on all optional warnings which are desirable for
normal code. At present this is -Wcomment, -Wtrigraphs,
-Wmultichar and a warning about integer promotion causing a
<br>
change of sign in &quot;#if&quot; expressions. Note that
many of the preprocessor&rsquo;s warnings are on by default
and have no options to control them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wcomment <br>
-Wcomments <br>
Warn whenever a comment-start sequence /* appears in a /*
comment, or whenever a backslash-newline appears in a //
comment. (Both forms have the same effect.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wtrigraphs <br>
Most trigraphs in comments cannot affect the meaning of the
program. However, a trigraph that would form an escaped
newline (??/ at the end of a line) can, by changing where
<br>
the comment begins or ends. Therefore, only trigraphs that
would form escaped newlines produce warnings inside a
comment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is implied by -Wall.
If -Wall is not given, this option is still enabled unless
trigraphs are enabled. To get trigraph conversion without
warnings, but get the <br>
other -Wall warnings, use -trigraphs -Wall
-Wno-trigraphs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wtraditional <br>
Warn about certain constructs that behave differently in
traditional and ISO C. Also warn about ISO C constructs that
have no traditional C equivalent, and problematic <br>
constructs which should be avoided.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wundef <br>
Warn whenever an identifier which is not a macro is
encountered in an #if directive, outside of defined. Such
identifiers are replaced with zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wunused-macros <br>
Warn about macros defined in the main file that are unused.
A macro is used if it is expanded or tested for existence at
least once. The preprocessor will also warn if the <br>
macro has not been used at the time it is redefined or
undefined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Built-in macros, macros defined
on the command line, and macros defined in include files are
not warned about.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: If a macro is actually
used, but only used in skipped conditional blocks, then CPP
will report it as unused. To avoid the warning in such a
case, you might improve the <br>
scope of the macro&rsquo;s definition by, for example,
moving it into the first skipped block. Alternatively, you
could provide a dummy use with something like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#if defined
the_macro_causing_the_warning <br>
#endif</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wendif-labels <br>
Warn whenever an #else or an #endif are followed by text.
This usually happens in code of the form</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#if FOO <br>
... <br>
#else FOO <br>
... <br>
#endif FOO</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The second and third
&quot;FOO&quot; should be in comments, but often are not in
older programs. This warning is on by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Werror <br>
Make all warnings into hard errors. Source code which
triggers warnings will be rejected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wsystem-headers <br>
Issue warnings for code in system headers. These are
normally unhelpful in finding bugs in your own code,
therefore suppressed. If you are responsible for the system
<br>
library, you may want to see them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w Suppress all warnings,
including those which GNU CPP issues by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pedantic <br>
Issue all the mandatory diagnostics listed in the C
standard. Some of them are left out by default, since they
trigger frequently on harmless code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pedantic-errors <br>
Issue all the mandatory diagnostics, and make all mandatory
diagnostics into errors. This includes mandatory diagnostics
that GCC issues without -pedantic but treats as <br>
warnings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M Instead of outputting the
result of preprocessing, output a rule suitable for make
describing the dependencies of the main source file. The
preprocessor outputs one make <br>
rule containing the object file name for that source file, a
colon, and the names of all the included files, including
those coming from -include or -imacros command line <br>
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unless specified explicitly
(with -MT or -MQ), the object file name consists of the name
of the source file with any suffix replaced with object file
suffix and with any <br>
leading directory parts removed. If there are many included
files then the rule is split into several lines using
&minus;newline. The rule has no commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option does not suppress
the preprocessor&rsquo;s debug output, such as -dM. To avoid
mixing such debug output with the dependency rules you
should explicitly specify the <br>
dependency output file with -MF, or use an environment
variable like DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT. Debug output will still
be sent to the regular output stream as normal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Passing -M to the driver implies
-E, and suppresses warnings with an implicit -w.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-MM Like -M but do not mention
header files that are found in system header directories,
nor header files that are included, directly or indirectly,
from such a header.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This implies that the choice of
angle brackets or double quotes in an #include directive
does not in itself determine whether that header will appear
in -MM dependency <br>
output. This is a slight change in semantics from GCC
versions 3.0 and earlier.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-MF file <br>
When used with -M or -MM, specifies a file to write the
dependencies to. If no -MF switch is given the preprocessor
sends the rules to the same place it would have sent <br>
preprocessed output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When used with the driver
options -MD or -MMD, -MF overrides the default dependency
output file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-MG In conjunction with an
option such as -M requesting dependency generation, -MG
assumes missing header files are generated files and adds
them to the dependency list without <br>
raising an error. The dependency filename is taken directly
from the &quot;#include&quot; directive without prepending
any path. -MG also suppresses preprocessed output, as a
missing <br>
header file renders this useless.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This feature is used in
automatic updating of makefiles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-MP This option instructs CPP to
add a phony target for each dependency other than the main
file, causing each to depend on nothing. These dummy rules
work around errors make <br>
gives if you remove header files without updating the
Makefile to match.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is typical output:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">test.o: test.c test.h</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">test.h:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-MT target <br>
Change the target of the rule emitted by dependency
generation. By default CPP takes the name of the main input
file, deletes any directory components and any file suffix
<br>
such as .c, and appends the platform&rsquo;s usual object
suffix. The result is the target.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An -MT option will set the
target to be exactly the string you specify. If you want
multiple targets, you can specify them as a single argument
to -MT, or use multiple -MT <br>
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, -MT
&rsquo;$(objpfx)foo.o&rsquo; might give</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$(objpfx)foo.o: foo.c</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-MQ target <br>
Same as -MT, but it quotes any characters which are special
to Make. -MQ &rsquo;$(objpfx)foo.o&rsquo; gives</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$$(objpfx)foo.o: foo.c</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default target is
automatically quoted, as if it were given with -MQ.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-MD -MD is equivalent to -M -MF
file, except that -E is not implied. The driver determines
file based on whether an -o option is given. If it is, the
driver uses its argument <br>
but with a suffix of .d, otherwise it takes the name of the
input file, removes any directory components and suffix, and
applies a .d suffix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If -MD is used in conjunction
with -E, any -o switch is understood to specify the
dependency output file, but if used without -E, each -o is
understood to specify a target <br>
object file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since -E is not implied, -MD can
be used to generate a dependency output file as a
side-effect of the compilation process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-MMD <br>
Like -MD except mention only user header files, not system
header files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x c <br>
-x c++ <br>
-x objective-c <br>
-x assembler-with-cpp <br>
Specify the source language: C, C++, Objective-C, or
assembly. This has nothing to do with standards conformance
or extensions; it merely selects which base syntax to <br>
expect. If you give none of these options, cpp will deduce
the language from the extension of the source file: .c, .cc,
.m, or .S. Some other common extensions for C++ and <br>
assembly are also recognized. If cpp does not recognize the
extension, it will treat the file as C; this is the most
generic mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: Previous versions of cpp
accepted a -lang option which selected both the language and
the standards conformance level. This option has been
removed, because it <br>
conflicts with the -l option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-std=standard <br>
-ansi <br>
Specify the standard to which the code should conform.
Currently CPP knows about C and C++ standards; others may be
added in the future.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">standard may be one of:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;c90&quot; <br>
&quot;c89&quot; <br>
&quot;iso9899:1990&quot; <br>
The ISO C standard from 1990. c90 is the customary shorthand
for this version of the standard.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -ansi option is equivalent
to -std=c90.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;iso9899:199409&quot; <br>
The 1990 C standard, as amended in 1994.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;iso9899:1999&quot; <br>
&quot;c99&quot; <br>
&quot;iso9899:199x&quot; <br>
&quot;c9x&quot; <br>
The revised ISO C standard, published in December 1999.
Before publication, this was known as C9X.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;iso9899:2011&quot; <br>
&quot;c11&quot; <br>
&quot;c1x&quot; <br>
The revised ISO C standard, published in December 2011.
Before publication, this was known as C1X.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;gnu90&quot; <br>
&quot;gnu89&quot; <br>
The 1990 C standard plus GNU extensions. This is the
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;gnu99&quot; <br>
&quot;gnu9x&quot; <br>
The 1999 C standard plus GNU extensions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;gnu11&quot; <br>
&quot;gnu1x&quot; <br>
The 2011 C standard plus GNU extensions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;c++98&quot; <br>
The 1998 ISO C++ standard plus amendments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;gnu++98&quot; <br>
The same as -std=c++98 plus GNU extensions. This is the
default for C++ code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I- Split the include path. Any
directories specified with -I options before -I- are
searched only for headers requested with &quot;#include
&quot;file&quot;&quot;; they are not searched for <br>
&quot;#include &lt;file&gt;&quot;. If additional directories
are specified with -I options after the -I-, those
directories are searched for all #include directives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition, -I- inhibits the
use of the directory of the current file directory as the
first search directory for &quot;#include
&quot;file&quot;&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option has been
deprecated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nostdinc <br>
Do not search the standard system directories for header
files. Only the directories you have specified with -I
options (and the directory of the current file, if <br>
appropriate) are searched.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nostdinc++ <br>
Do not search for header files in the C++-specific standard
directories, but do still search the other standard
directories. (This option is used when building the C++ <br>
library.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-include file <br>
Process file as if &quot;#include &quot;file&quot;&quot;
appeared as the first line of the primary source file.
However, the first directory searched for file is the
preprocessor&rsquo;s working <br>
directory instead of the directory containing the main
source file. If not found there, it is searched for in the
remainder of the &quot;#include &quot;...&quot;&quot; search
chain as normal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If multiple -include options are
given, the files are included in the order they appear on
the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-imacros file <br>
Exactly like -include, except that any output produced by
scanning file is thrown away. Macros it defines remain
defined. This allows you to acquire all the macros from a
<br>
header without also processing its declarations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All files specified by -imacros
are processed before all files specified by -include.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-idirafter dir <br>
Search dir for header files, but do it after all directories
specified with -I and the standard system directories have
been exhausted. dir is treated as a system include <br>
directory. If dir begins with &quot;=&quot;, then the
&quot;=&quot; will be replaced by the sysroot prefix; see
--sysroot and -isysroot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-iprefix prefix <br>
Specify prefix as the prefix for subsequent -iwithprefix
options. If the prefix represents a directory, you should
include the final /.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-iwithprefix dir <br>
-iwithprefixbefore dir <br>
Append dir to the prefix specified previously with -iprefix,
and add the resulting directory to the include search path.
-iwithprefixbefore puts it in the same place -I <br>
would; -iwithprefix puts it where -idirafter would.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-isysroot dir <br>
This option is like the --sysroot option, but applies only
to header files (except for Darwin targets, where it applies
to both header files and libraries). See the <br>
--sysroot option for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-imultilib dir <br>
Use dir as a subdirectory of the directory containing
target-specific C++ headers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-isystem dir <br>
Search dir for header files, after all directories specified
by -I but before the standard system directories. Mark it as
a system directory, so that it gets the same <br>
special treatment as is applied to the standard system
directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If dir begins with
&quot;=&quot;, then the &quot;=&quot; will be replaced by
the sysroot prefix; see --sysroot and -isysroot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-iquote dir <br>
Search dir only for header files requested with
&quot;#include &quot;file&quot;&quot;; they are not searched
for &quot;#include &lt;file&gt;&quot;, before all
directories specified by -I and before the standard <br>
system directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If dir begins with
&quot;=&quot;, then the &quot;=&quot; will be replaced by
the sysroot prefix; see --sysroot and -isysroot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fdirectives-only <br>
When preprocessing, handle directives, but do not expand
macros.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The option&rsquo;s behavior
depends on the -E and -fpreprocessed options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With -E, preprocessing is
limited to the handling of directives such as
&quot;#define&quot;, &quot;#ifdef&quot;, and
&quot;#error&quot;. Other preprocessor operations, such as
macro expansion and <br>
trigraph conversion are not performed. In addition, the -dD
option is implicitly enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With -fpreprocessed,
predefinition of command line and most builtin macros is
disabled. Macros such as &quot;__LINE__&quot;, which are
contextually dependent, are handled normally. <br>
This enables compilation of files previously preprocessed
with &quot;-E -fdirectives-only&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With both -E and -fpreprocessed,
the rules for -fpreprocessed take precedence. This enables
full preprocessing of files previously preprocessed with
&quot;-E -fdirectives-only&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fdollars-in-identifiers <br>
Accept $ in identifiers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fextended-identifiers <br>
Accept universal character names in identifiers. This option
is experimental; in a future version of GCC, it will be
enabled by default for C99 and C++.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-canonical-system-headers
<br>
When preprocessing, do not shorten system header paths with
canonicalization.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fpreprocessed <br>
Indicate to the preprocessor that the input file has already
been preprocessed. This suppresses things like macro
expansion, trigraph conversion, escaped newline splicing,
<br>
and processing of most directives. The preprocessor still
recognizes and removes comments, so that you can pass a file
preprocessed with -C to the compiler without problems. <br>
In this mode the integrated preprocessor is little more than
a tokenizer for the front ends.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fpreprocessed is implicit if
the input file has one of the extensions .i, .ii or .mi.
These are the extensions that GCC uses for preprocessed
files created by -save-temps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ftabstop=width <br>
Set the distance between tab stops. This helps the
preprocessor report correct column numbers in warnings or
errors, even if tabs appear on the line. If the value is
less <br>
than 1 or greater than 100, the option is ignored. The
default is 8.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fdebug-cpp <br>
This option is only useful for debugging GCC. When used with
-E, dumps debugging information about location maps. Every
token in the output is preceded by the dump of the <br>
map its location belongs to. The dump of the map holding the
location of a token would be:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">{&quot;P&quot;:F&lt;/file/path&gt;;&quot;F&quot;:F&lt;/includer/path&gt;;&quot;L&quot;:&lt;line_num&gt;;&quot;C&quot;:&lt;col_num&gt;;&quot;S&quot;:&lt;system_header_p&gt;;&quot;M&quot;:&lt;map_address&gt;;&quot;E&quot;:&lt;macro_expansion_p&gt;,&quot;loc&quot;:&lt;location&gt;}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When used without -E, this
option has no effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ftrack-macro-expansion[=level]
<br>
Track locations of tokens across macro expansions. This
allows the compiler to emit diagnostic about the current
macro expansion stack when a compilation error occurs in a
<br>
macro expansion. Using this option makes the preprocessor
and the compiler consume more memory. The level parameter
can be used to choose the level of precision of token <br>
location tracking thus decreasing the memory consumption if
necessary. Value 0 of level de-activates this option just as
if no -ftrack-macro-expansion was present on the <br>
command line. Value 1 tracks tokens locations in a degraded
mode for the sake of minimal memory overhead. In this mode
all tokens resulting from the expansion of an argument <br>
of a function-like macro have the same location. Value 2
tracks tokens locations completely. This value is the most
memory hungry. When this option is given no argument, the
<br>
default parameter value is 2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that
-ftrack-macro-expansion=2 is activated by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fexec-charset=charset <br>
Set the execution character set, used for string and
character constants. The default is UTF-8. charset can be
any encoding supported by the system&rsquo;s
&quot;iconv&quot; library <br>
routine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fwide-exec-charset=charset <br>
Set the wide execution character set, used for wide string
and character constants. The default is UTF-32 or UTF-16,
whichever corresponds to the width of &quot;wchar_t&quot;.
As <br>
with -fexec-charset, charset can be any encoding supported
by the system&rsquo;s &quot;iconv&quot; library routine;
however, you will have problems with encodings that do not
fit exactly in <br>
&quot;wchar_t&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-finput-charset=charset <br>
Set the input character set, used for translation from the
character set of the input file to the source character set
used by GCC. If the locale does not specify, or GCC <br>
cannot get this information from the locale, the default is
UTF-8. This can be overridden by either the locale or this
command line option. Currently the command line <br>
option takes precedence if there&rsquo;s a conflict. charset
can be any encoding supported by the system&rsquo;s
&quot;iconv&quot; library routine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fworking-directory <br>
Enable generation of linemarkers in the preprocessor output
that will let the compiler know the current working
directory at the time of preprocessing. When this option is
<br>
enabled, the preprocessor will emit, after the initial
linemarker, a second linemarker with the current working
directory followed by two slashes. GCC will use this <br>
directory, when it&rsquo;s present in the preprocessed
input, as the directory emitted as the current working
directory in some debugging information formats. This option
is <br>
implicitly enabled if debugging information is enabled, but
this can be inhibited with the negated form
-fno-working-directory. If the -P flag is present in the
command <br>
line, this option has no effect, since no &quot;#line&quot;
directives are emitted whatsoever.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-show-column <br>
Do not print column numbers in diagnostics. This may be
necessary if diagnostics are being scanned by a program that
does not understand the column numbers, such as dejagnu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A predicate=answer <br>
Make an assertion with the predicate predicate and answer
answer. This form is preferred to the older form -A
predicate(answer), which is still supported, because it does
<br>
not use shell special characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A -predicate=answer <br>
Cancel an assertion with the predicate predicate and answer
answer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dCHARS <br>
CHARS is a sequence of one or more of the following
characters, and must not be preceded by a space. Other
characters are interpreted by the compiler proper, or
reserved for <br>
future versions of GCC, and so are silently ignored. If you
specify characters whose behavior conflicts, the result is
undefined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">M Instead of the normal output,
generate a list of #define directives for all the macros
defined during the execution of the preprocessor, including
predefined macros. <br>
This gives you a way of finding out what is predefined in
your version of the preprocessor. Assuming you have no file
foo.h, the command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">touch foo.h; cpp -dM foo.h</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will show all the predefined
macros.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you use -dM without the -E
option, -dM is interpreted as a synonym for
-fdump-rtl-mach.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">D Like M except in two respects:
it does not include the predefined macros, and it outputs
both the #define directives and the result of preprocessing.
Both kinds of <br>
output go to the standard output file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">N Like D, but emit only the
macro names, not their expansions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">I Output #include directives in
addition to the result of preprocessing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">U Like D except that only macros
that are expanded, or whose definedness is tested in
preprocessor directives, are output; the output is delayed
until the use or test of <br>
the macro; and #undef directives are also output for macros
tested but undefined at the time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P Inhibit generation of
linemarkers in the output from the preprocessor. This might
be useful when running the preprocessor on something that is
not C code, and will be sent <br>
to a program which might be confused by the linemarkers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C Do not discard comments. All
comments are passed through to the output file, except for
comments in processed directives, which are deleted along
with the directive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You should be prepared for side
effects when using -C; it causes the preprocessor to treat
comments as tokens in their own right. For example, comments
appearing at the <br>
start of what would be a directive line have the effect of
turning that line into an ordinary source line, since the
first token on the line is no longer a #.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-CC Do not discard comments,
including during macro expansion. This is like -C, except
that comments contained within macros are also passed
through to the output file where the <br>
macro is expanded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition to the side-effects
of the -C option, the -CC option causes all C++-style
comments inside a macro to be converted to C-style comments.
This is to prevent later <br>
use of that macro from inadvertently commenting out the
remainder of the source line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -CC option is generally used
to support lint comments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-traditional-cpp <br>
Try to imitate the behavior of old-fashioned C
preprocessors, as opposed to ISO C preprocessors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-trigraphs <br>
Process trigraph sequences.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-remap <br>
Enable special code to work around file systems which only
permit very short file names, such as MS-DOS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help <br>
--target-help <br>
Print text describing all the command line options instead
of preprocessing anything.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Verbose mode. Print out GNU
CPP&rsquo;s version number at the beginning of execution,
and report the final form of the include path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H Print the name of each header
file used, in addition to other normal activities. Each name
is indented to show how deep in the #include stack it is.
Precompiled header <br>
files are also printed, even if they are found to be
invalid; an invalid precompiled header file is printed with
...x and a valid one with ...! .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-version <br>
--version <br>
Print out GNU CPP&rsquo;s version number. With one dash,
proceed to preprocess as normal. With two dashes, exit
immediately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
This section describes the environment variables that affect
how CPP operates. You can use them to specify directories or
prefixes to use when searching for include files, or to <br>
control dependency output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that you can also specify
places to search using options such as -I, and control
dependency output with options like -M. These take
precedence over environment variables, <br>
which in turn take precedence over the configuration of
GCC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CPATH <br>
C_INCLUDE_PATH <br>
CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH <br>
OBJC_INCLUDE_PATH <br>
Each variable&rsquo;s value is a list of directories
separated by a special character, much like PATH, in which
to look for header files. The special character,
&quot;PATH_SEPARATOR&quot;, <br>
is target-dependent and determined at GCC build time. For
Microsoft Windows-based targets it is a semicolon, and for
almost all other targets it is a colon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CPATH specifies a list of
directories to be searched as if specified with -I, but
after any paths given with -I options on the command line.
This environment variable is <br>
used regardless of which language is being preprocessed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The remaining environment
variables apply only when preprocessing the particular
language indicated. Each specifies a list of directories to
be searched as if specified with <br>
-isystem, but after any paths given with -isystem options on
the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In all these variables, an empty
element instructs the compiler to search its current working
directory. Empty elements can appear at the beginning or end
of a path. For <br>
instance, if the value of CPATH is
&quot;:/special/include&quot;, that has the same effect as
-I. -I/special/include.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT <br>
If this variable is set, its value specifies how to output
dependencies for Make based on the non-system header files
processed by the compiler. System header files are <br>
ignored in the dependency output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The value of DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT
can be just a file name, in which case the Make rules are
written to that file, guessing the target name from the
source file name. Or the <br>
value can have the form file target, in which case the rules
are written to file file using target as the target
name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In other words, this environment
variable is equivalent to combining the options -MM and -MF,
with an optional -MT switch too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SUNPRO_DEPENDENCIES <br>
This variable is the same as DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT (see
above), except that system header files are not ignored, so
it implies -M rather than -MM. However, the dependence on
<br>
the main input file is omitted.</p>
