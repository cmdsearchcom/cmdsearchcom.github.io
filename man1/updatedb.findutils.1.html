<p>UPDATEDB(1) General Commands Manual UPDATEDB(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
updatedb - update a file name database</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
updatedb [options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This manual page documents the GNU version of updatedb,
which updates file name databases used by GNU locate. The
file name databases contain lists of files that were in
partic&acirc; <br>
ular directory trees when the databases were last updated.
The file name of the default database is determined when
locate and updatedb are configured and installed. The
fre&acirc; <br>
quency with which the databases are updated and the
directories for which they contain entries depend on how
often updatedb is run, and with which arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In networked environments, it
often makes sense to build a database at the root of each
filesystem, containing the entries for that filesystem.
updatedb is then run for each <br>
filesystem on the fileserver where that filesystem is on a
local disk, to prevent thrashing the network. Users can
select which databases locate searches using an environment
<br>
variable or command line option; see locate(1). Databases
cannot be concatenated together.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The @samp{LOCATGE02} database
format was introduced in GNU findutils version 4.0 in order
to allow machines with different byte orderings to share the
databases. GNU locate can <br>
read both the old and @samp{LOCATE02} database formats,
though support for the old pre-4.0 database format will be
removed shortly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
--findoptions=&rsquo;-option1 -option2...&rsquo; <br>
Global options to pass on to find. The environment variable
FINDOPTIONS also sets this value. Default is none.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--localpaths=&rsquo;path1
path2...&rsquo; <br>
Non-network directories to put in the database. Default is
/.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--netpaths=&rsquo;path1
path2...&rsquo; <br>
Network (NFS, AFS, RFS, etc.) directories to put in the
database. The environment variable NETPATHS also sets this
value. Default is none.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--prunepaths=&rsquo;path1
path2...&rsquo; <br>
Directories to not put in the database, which would
otherwise be. Remove any trailing slashes from the path
names, otherwise updatedb won&Acirc;&acute;t recognise the
paths you want <br>
to omit (because it uses them as regular expression
patterns). The environment variable PRUNEPATHS also sets
this value. Default is /tmp /usr/tmp /var/tmp /afs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--prunefs=&rsquo;path...&rsquo;
<br>
File systems to not put in the database, which would
otherwise be. Note that files are pruned when a file system
is reached; any file system mounted under an undesired <br>
file system will be ignored. The environment variable
PRUNEFS also sets this value. Default is nfs NFS proc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--output=dbfile <br>
The database file to build. Default is system-dependent. In
Debian GNU/Linux, the default is
/var/cache/locate/locatedb.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--localuser=user <br>
The user to search non-network directories as, using su(1).
Default is to search the non-network directories as the
current user. You can also use the environment vari&acirc;
<br>
able LOCALUSER to set this user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--netuser=user <br>
The user to search network directories as, using su(1).
Default is daemon. You can also use the environment variable
NETUSER to set this user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dbformat=F <br>
Create the database in format F. The default format is
called LOCATE02. Alternatively the slocate format is also
supported. When the slocate format is in use, the
data&acirc; <br>
base produced is marked as having security level 1. If you
want to build a system-wide slocate database, you may want
to run updatedb as root.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Print the version number of updatedb and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help Print a summary of the
options to updatedb and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
find(1), locate(1), locatedb(5), xargs(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The full documentation for
updatedb is maintained as a Texinfo manual. If the info and
updatedb programs are properly installed at your site, the
command info updatedb should <br>
give you access to the complete manual.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
The updatedb program correctly handles filenames containing
newlines, but only if the system&rsquo;s sort command has a
working -z option. If you suspect that locate may need to
<br>
return filenames containing newlines, consider using its
--null option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The best way to report a bug is
to use the form at
http://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?group=findutils. The reason
for this is that you will then be able to track progress in
fixing <br>
the problem. Other comments about updatedb(1) and about the
findutils package in general can be sent to the
bug-findutils mailing list. To join the list, send email to
bug- <br>
findutils-request@gnu.org.</p>
