DtdToHaskell - a XML DTD to Haskell translator

DtdToHaskell is a tool for translating any valid XML DTD into equivalent Haskell
  types. This allows you to generate, edit, and transform documents as normal
  typed values in programs, and to read and write them as human-readable XML
  documents. It uses the Text.XML.HaXml.XmlContent class as a framework for
  printing and parsing.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>DtdToHaskell</b> reads and parses a DTD from <i>dtdfile</i> (which may be
  either just a DTD, or a full XML document containing an internal DTD). It
  generates into <i>outfile</i> a Haskell module containing a collection of type
  definitions plus some class instance declarations for I/O.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In order to use the resulting module, you need to import it, and also to import
  Text.XML.HaXml.XmlContent. To read and write XML files as values of the
  declared types, use some of the convenience functions from XmlContent.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You will need to study the automatically-generated type declarations to write
  your own code using them - but most things have pretty obvious parallels to
  the DTD structure.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="LIMITATIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#LIMITATIONS">LIMITATIONS</a></h1>
The generated Haskell contains references to types like OneOf3 where there is a
  choice between n (in this case 3) different tags. Currently, the module
  Text.XML.HaXml.OneOfN defines these types up to n=20. If your DTD requires
  larger choices, then use the tool <b>MkOneOf</b> to generate the extra size or
  range of sizes you need.
<div class="Pp"></div>
We mangle tag names and attribute names to ensure that they have the correct
  lexical form in Haskell, but this means that (for instance) we can't
  distinguish Myname and myname, which are different names in XML but translate
  to overlapping types in Haskell (and hence probably won't compile).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Attribute names translate into named fields: but because Haskell doesn't allow
  different types to have the same named field, this means your XML document
  which uses the same name for similar attributes on different tags would crash
  and burn. We have fixed this by incorporating the tagname into the named field
  in addition to the attribute name, e.g. tagAttr instead of just attr. Uglier,
  but more portable.
<div class="Pp"></div>
XML namespaces. Currently, we just mangle the namespace identifier into any tag
  name which uses it. Probably the right way to do it is to regard the namespace
  as a separate imported module, and hence translate the namespace prefix into a
  module qualifier. Does this sound about right? (It isn't implemented yet.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
External subset. Since HaXml release 1.00, we support the XML DTD external
  subset. This means we can read and parse a whole bunch of files as part of the
  same DTD, and we respect INCLUDE and IGNORE conditional sections. The sub-DTD
  files must be available locally - we don't go looking for them on the web.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There are some fringe parts of the DTD we are not entirely sure about, such as
  Tokenised Types and Notation Types. In particular, there is no validity
  checking of these external references. If you find a problem, mail us:
