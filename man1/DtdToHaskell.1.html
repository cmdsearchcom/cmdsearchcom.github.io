<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
DtdToHaskell - a XML DTD to Haskell translator</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
DtdToHaskell [ dtdfile [ outfile ]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Missing file arguments or dashes
(-) indicate standard input or output respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
DtdToHaskell is a tool for translating any valid XML DTD
into equivalent Haskell types. This allows you to generate,
edit, and transform documents as normal typed values in
pro&acirc; <br>
grams, and to read and write them as human-readable XML
documents. It uses the Text.XML.HaXml.XmlContent class as a
framework for printing and parsing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DtdToHaskell reads and parses a
DTD from dtdfile (which may be either just a DTD, or a full
XML document containing an internal DTD). It generates into
outfile a Haskell module <br>
containing a collection of type definitions plus some class
instance declarations for I/O.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to use the resulting
module, you need to import it, and also to import
Text.XML.HaXml.XmlContent. To read and write XML files as
values of the declared types, use some <br>
of the convenience functions from XmlContent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You will need to study the
automatically-generated type declarations to write your own
code using them - but most things have pretty obvious
parallels to the DTD structure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LIMITATIONS <br>
The generated Haskell contains references to types like
OneOf3 where there is a choice between n (in this case 3)
different tags. Currently, the module Text.XML.HaXml.OneOfN
<br>
defines these types up to n=20. If your DTD requires larger
choices, then use the tool MkOneOf to generate the extra
size or range of sizes you need.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">We mangle tag names and
attribute names to ensure that they have the correct lexical
form in Haskell, but this means that (for instance) we
can&rsquo;t distinguish Myname and myname, <br>
which are different names in XML but translate to
overlapping types in Haskell (and hence probably won&rsquo;t
compile).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Attribute names translate into
named fields: but because Haskell doesn&rsquo;t allow
different types to have the same named field, this means
your XML document which uses the same name <br>
for similar attributes on different tags would crash and
burn. We have fixed this by incorporating the tagname into
the named field in addition to the attribute name, e.g. <br>
tagAttr instead of just attr. Uglier, but more portable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">XML namespaces. Currently, we
just mangle the namespace identifier into any tag name which
uses it. Probably the right way to do it is to regard the
namespace as a separate <br>
imported module, and hence translate the namespace prefix
into a module qualifier. Does this sound about right? (It
isn&rsquo;t implemented yet.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">External subset. Since HaXml
release 1.00, we support the XML DTD external subset. This
means we can read and parse a whole bunch of files as part
of the same DTD, and we <br>
respect INCLUDE and IGNORE conditional sections. The sub-DTD
files must be available locally - we don&rsquo;t go looking
for them on the web.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are some fringe parts of
the DTD we are not entirely sure about, such as Tokenised
Types and Notation Types. In particular, there is no
validity checking of these external <br>
references. If you find a problem, mail us: <br>
Malcolm.Wallace@cs.york.ac.uk</p>
