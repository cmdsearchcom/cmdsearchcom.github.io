<p>GROPDF(1) General Commands Manual GROPDF(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
gropdf - PDF driver for groff</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
gropdf [-delvs] [-F dir] [-p papersize] [-y foundry] [-u
[cmapfile]] [files ...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is possible to have
whitespace between a command line option and its
parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
gropdf translates the output of GNU troff to PDF. Normally
gropdf should be invoked by using the groff command with a
-Tpdf option. If no files are given, gropdf reads the <br>
standard input. A filename of - also causes gropdf to read
the standard input. PDF output is written to the standard
output. When gropdf is run by groff options can be passed
<br>
to gropdf using groff&rsquo;s -P option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See section FONT INSTALLATION
below for a guide how to install fonts for gropdf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-d Include debug information as comments within the PDF.
Also produces an uncompressed PDF.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e Force all fonts to be
embedded in the PDF.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Fdir Prepend directory
dir/devname to the search path for font, and device
description files; name is the name of the device, usually
pdf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l Print the document in
landscape format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ppaper-size <br>
Set physical dimension of output medium. This overrides the
papersize, paperlength, and paperwidth commands in the DESC
file; it accepts the same arguments as the paper&acirc; <br>
size command. See groff_font (5) for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Print the version number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-yfoundry <br>
Set the foundry to use for selecting fonts of the same
name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e Forces gropdf to embed ALL
fonts (even the 14 base PDF fonts).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Append a comment line to end
of PDF showing statistics, i.e. number of pages in document.
Ghostscript&rsquo;s ps2pdf complains about this line if it
is included, but works any&acirc; <br>
way.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u <br>
-ucmapfilename <br>
Gropdf normally includes a ToUnicode CMap with any font
created using text.enc as the encoding file, this makes it
easier to search for words which contain ligatures. You <br>
can include your own CMap by specifying a cmapfilename or
have no CMap at all by omitting the argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USAGE <br>
The input to gropdf must be in the format output by
troff(1). This is described in groff_out(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition, the device and font
description files for the device used must meet certain
requirements: The resolution must be an integer multiple of
72 times the sizescale. The <br>
pdf device uses a resolution of 72000 and a sizescale of
1000.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The device description file must
contain a valid paper size; see groff_font(5) for more
information. gropdf uses the same Type 1 Adobe postscript
fonts as the grops device <br>
driver. Although the PDF Standard allows the use of other
font types (like TrueType) this implementation only accepts
the Type 1 postscript font. Fewer Type 1 fonts are
sup&acirc; <br>
ported natively in PDF documents than the standard 35 fonts
supported by grops and all postscript printers, but all the
fonts are available since any which aren&rsquo;t supported
<br>
natively are automatically embedded in the PDF.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gropdf supports the concept of
foundries, that is different versions of basically the same
font. During install a Foundry file controls where fonts are
found and builds groff <br>
fonts from the files it discovers on your system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each font description file must
contain a command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">internalname psname</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">which says that the PostScript
name of the font is psname. Lines starting with # and blank
lines are ignored. The code for each character given in the
font file must correspond <br>
to the code in the default encoding for the font. This code
can be used with the escape sequence in troff to select the
character, even if the character does not have a groff <br>
name. Every character in the font file must exist in the
PostScript font, and the widths given in the font file must
match the widths used in the PostScript font.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that gropdf is currently
only able to display the first 256 glyphs in any font. This
restriction will be lifted in a later version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gropdf can automatically include
the downloadable fonts necessary to print the document.
Fonts may be in PFA or PFB format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any downloadable fonts which
should, when required, be included by gropdf must be listed
in the file /usr/share/groff/1.22.2/font/devpdf/download;
this should consist of lines of <br>
the form</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">foundry font filename</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where foundry is the foundry
name or blank for the default foundry. font is the
PostScript name of the font, and filename is the name of the
file containing the font; lines <br>
beginning with # and blank lines are ignored; fields must be
separated by tabs; filename is searched for using the same
mechanism that is used for groff font metric files. The <br>
download file itself is also searched for using this
mechanism; currently, only the first found file in the font
path is used. Foundry names are usually a single character
(such <br>
as &lsquo;U&rsquo; for the URW Foundry) or blank for the
default foundry. This default uses the same fonts as
ghostscript uses when it embeds fonts in a PDF file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the default setup there are
styles called R, I, B, and BI mounted at font positions 1 to
4. The fonts are grouped into families A, BM, C, H, HN, N,
P, and T having members in <br>
each of these styles:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AR AvantGarde-Book <br>
AI AvantGarde-BookOblique <br>
AB AvantGarde-Demi <br>
ABI AvantGarde-DemiOblique <br>
BMR Bookman-Light <br>
BMI Bookman-LightItalic <br>
BMB Bookman-Demi <br>
BMBI Bookman-DemiItalic <br>
CR Courier <br>
CI Courier-Oblique <br>
CB Courier-Bold <br>
CBI Courier-BoldOblique <br>
HR Helvetica <br>
HI Helvetica-Oblique <br>
HB Helvetica-Bold <br>
HBI Helvetica-BoldOblique <br>
HNR Helvetica-Narrow <br>
HNI Helvetica-Narrow-Oblique <br>
HNB Helvetica-Narrow-Bold <br>
HNBI Helvetica-Narrow-BoldOblique <br>
NR NewCenturySchlbk-Roman <br>
NI NewCenturySchlbk-Italic <br>
NB NewCenturySchlbk-Bold <br>
NBI NewCenturySchlbk-BoldItalic <br>
PR Palatino-Roman <br>
PI Palatino-Italic <br>
PB Palatino-Bold <br>
PBI Palatino-BoldItalic <br>
TR Times-Roman <br>
TI Times-Italic <br>
TB Times-Bold <br>
TBI Times-BoldItalic</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is also the following font
which is not a member of a family:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ZCMI
ZapfChancery-MediumItalic</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are also some special
fonts called S for the PS Symbol font. The lower case greek
characters are automatically slanted (to match the
SymbolSlanted font (SS) available to <br>
postscript). Zapf Dingbats is available as ZD, the
&quot;hand pointing left&quot; glyph ( is available since it
has been defined using the extension which reverses the <br>
direction of letters within words.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default color for and is
black; for colors defined in the &lsquo;rgb&rsquo; color
space setrgbcolor is used, for &lsquo;cmy&rsquo; and
&lsquo;cmyk&rsquo; setcmykcolor, and for &lsquo;gray&rsquo;
setgray. Note that <br>
setcmykcolor is a PostScript LanguageLevel 2 command and
thus not available on some older printers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gropdf understands some of the X
commands produced using the sequences supported by grops.
Specifically, the following is supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Suppress output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Stop suppressing output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where n is the angle of
rotation. This is to support the align command in gpic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Again used by gpic to restore
after rotation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where n can be one of the
following values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 = Miter join <br>
1 = Round join <br>
2 = Bevel join</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where n can be one of the
following values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 = Butt cap <br>
1 = Round cap, and <br>
2 = Projecting square cap</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All the pdfmark macros installed
by using -m pdfmark or -m mspdf (see documentation in
&lsquo;pdfmark.pdf&rsquo;). A subset of these macros are
installed automatically when you use <br>
-Tpdf so you should not need to use &lsquo;-m pdfmark&rsquo;
for using most of the PDF functionality.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All other ps: tags are silently
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One used by the DVI driver is
also recognised:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where the paper-size parameter
is the same as the papersize command. See groff_font(5) for
details. This means that you can alter the page size at will
within the PDF <br>
file being created by gropdf. If you do want to change the
paper size, it must be done before you start creating the
page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition, gropdf supports its
own suite of pdf: tags. The following tags are
supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Place an image of the specified
width containing the PDF drawing from file file of desired
width and height (if height is missing or zero then it is
scaled proportion&acirc; <br>
ally). If alignment is -L the drawing is left aligned. If it
is -C or -R a linelength greater than the width of the
drawing is required as well. If width is specified <br>
as zero then the width is scaled in proportion to the
height.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This toggles a flag which
reverses the direction of printing letter by letter, i.e.,
each separate letter is reversed, not the entire word. This
is useful for reversing <br>
the direction of glyphs in the Dingbats font. To return to
normal printing repeat the command again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The macros which support PDF
Bookmarks use this call internally to start the definition
of bookmark hotspot (user will have called &lsquo;.pdfhref
L&rsquo; with the text which will <br>
become the &lsquo;hot spot&rsquo; region). Normally this is
never used except from within the pdfmark macros.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The macros which support PDF
Bookmarks use this call internally to stop the definition of
bookmark hotspot (user will have called &lsquo;.pdfhref
L&rsquo; with the text which will <br>
become the &lsquo;hot spot&rsquo; region). Normally this is
never used except from within the pdfmark macros.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are using page traps to
produce headings, footings, etc., you need to use these in
case a &lsquo;hot spot&rsquo; crosses a page boundary,
otherwise any text output by the head&acirc; <br>
ing or footing macro will be marked as part of the
&lsquo;hot spot&rsquo;. To stop this happening just place
&lsquo;.pdfmarksuspend&rsquo; and
&lsquo;.pdfmarkrestart&rsquo; at the start and end of the
page <br>
trap macro, respectively. (These are just convenience macros
which emit the These macros must only be used within page
traps.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Importing graphics <br>
gropdf only supports importing other PDF files as graphics.
But that PDF file may contain any of the graphic formats
supported by the PDF standard (such as JPEG, PNG, GIF, <br>
etc.). So any application which outputs PDF can be used as
an embedded file in gropdf. The PDF file you wish to insert
must be a single page and the drawing must just fit <br>
inside the media size of the PDF file. So, in inkscape(1) or
gimp(1) (for example) make sure the canvas size just fits
the image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The PDF parser used in gropdf
has not been rigorously tested with all possible
applications which produce PDFs. If you find a single page
PDF which fails to import properly, it <br>
is worth running it through the pdftk(1) program by issuing
the command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pdftk oldfile.pdf output
newfile.pdf</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may find that newfile.pdf
will now load successfully.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TrueType and other font formats
<br>
gropdf does not support any other fonts except Adobe Type 1
(PFA or PFB).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FONT INSTALLATION <br>
This section gives a summary of the above explanations; it
can serve as a step-by-step font installation guide for
gropdf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Convert your
font to something groff understands. This is either a
PostScript Type 1 font in either PFA or PFB, together with
an AFM file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The very first line in a PFA/PFB
file contains this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%!PS-AdobeFont-1.0:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A PFB file has this also in the
first line, but the string is preceded with some binary
bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Convert the AFM
file to a groff font description file with the afmtodit(1)
program. An example call is</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">afmtodit Foo-Bar-Bold.afm
map/textmap FBB</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">which converts the metric file
&lsquo;Foo-Bar-Bold.afm&rsquo; to the groff font
&lsquo;FBB&rsquo;. If you have a font family which comes
with normal, bold, italic, and bold italic faces, it is
rec&acirc; <br>
ommended to use the letters R, B, I, and BI, respectively,
as postfixes in the groff font names to make groff&rsquo;s
&lsquo;.fam&rsquo; request work. An example is groff&rsquo;s
built-in Times- <br>
Roman font: The font family name is T, and the groff font
names are TR, TB, TI, and TBI.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Install both the
groff font description files and the fonts in a
&lsquo;devpdf&rsquo; subdirectory of the font path which
groff finds. See the ENVIRONMENT section in the troff(1) man
<br>
page which lists the actual value of the font path. Note
that groff doesn&rsquo;t use the AFM files (but it is a good
idea to store them anyway).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Register all
fonts which must be downloaded to the printer in the
&lsquo;devpdf/download&rsquo; file. Only the first
occurrence of this file in the font path is read. This means
that <br>
you should copy the default &lsquo;download&rsquo; file to
the first directory in your font path and add your fonts
there. To continue the above example we assume that the PS
font name <br>
for Foo-Bar-Bold.pfa is &lsquo;XY-Foo-Bar-Bold&rsquo; (the
PS font name is stored in the internalname field in the
&lsquo;FBB&rsquo; file) and belongs to foundry
&lsquo;F&rsquo;, thus the following line should <br>
be added to &lsquo;download&rsquo;:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">F XY-Foo-Bar-Bold
Foo-Bar-Bold.pfa</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use a tab character to separate
the fields, and the &lsquo;foundry&rsquo; field should be
null for the default foundry.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
GROFF_FONT_PATH <br>
A list of directories in which to search for the devname
directory in addition to the default ones. If, in the
&lsquo;download&rsquo; file, the font file has been
specified with a <br>
full path, no directories are searched. See troff(1) and
groff_font(5) for more details.</p>
