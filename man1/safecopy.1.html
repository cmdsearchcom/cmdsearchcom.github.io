<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
safecopy - rescue data from a source that causes IO
errors</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
safecopy [OPTION]... SOURCE DEST</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
safecopy tries to get as much data from SOURCE as possible,
even resorting to device specific low level operations if
applicable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is achieved by identifying
problematic or damaged areas, skipping over them and
continuing reading afterwards. The corresponding area in the
destination file is either <br>
skipped (on initial creation that means padded with zeros)
or deliberately filled with a recognizable pattern to later
find affected files on a corrupted device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Safecopy uses an incremental
algorithm to identify the exact beginning and end of bad
areas, allowing the user to trade minimum accesses to bad
areas for thorough data resurrec&acirc; <br>
tion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Multiple passes over the same
file are possible, to first retrieve as much data from a
device as possible with minimum harm, and then trying to
retrieve some of the remaining <br>
data with increasingly aggressive read attempts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For this to work, the source
device or file has to be seekable. For unseekable devices
(like tapes) you can try to use an external script to
execute a controlled skip over the <br>
damaged part for you.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(For example by using &quot;mt
seek&quot; and &quot;mt tell&quot; on an SCSI tape device)
See the &quot;-S &lt;seekscript&gt;&quot; parameter for
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Performance and success of this
tool depend extremely on the device driver, firmware and
underlying hardware.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Currently safecopy supports RAW
access to CDROM drives to read data directly of a CD,
bypassing some driver dependant error correction. This can
speed up data retrieval from CDs <br>
and reduce system load during recovery, as well as increase
the success rate. Safecopy uses the disc status syscall to
determine sector size and addressing of CDs. This fails on
<br>
mixed-mode or multi-session CDs, since the sector layout can
change within the disk, but would still work on the the big
majority of disks. Other disks can still be recovered <br>
using normal high level data access. Safecopy auto-detects
the disk type involved during scan for disk and block
size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some CD/DVD drives are known to
cause the ATAPI bus to crash on errors, causing the device
driver to freeze for times up to and beyond a minute per
error. Try to avoid using such <br>
drives for media recovery. Using safecopys low level access
features might help under some circumstances.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some drives can read bad media
better than others. Be sure to attempt data recovery of CDs
and DVDs on several different drives and computers. You can
use safecopys incremental <br>
recovery feature to read previously unreadable sectors
only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RELIABILITY <br>
Data recovery from damaged media is a delicate task, in the
worst case its success or failure can safe or ruin whole
companies and seal affected peoples personal fate. It is
<br>
paramount that any tools written for that purpose are
reliable and trustworthy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A user needs to know what
exactly the software is doing to his hardware and data. The
outcome of any operation needs to be both understandable and
predictable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An &quot;intelligent data
resurrection wizard&quot; with unknown complex internal
behaviour may be a nifty tool, but does not meet the above
requirements of predictable outcome, nor will <br>
the user know in advance what is done to his data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The operation sequence of
safecopy has been kept relatively simple to assure this
predictability. Unfortunately feature additions have risen
the complexity and lead to undefined <br>
outcome in the past when include and exclude lists had been
mixed, especially when mixing different block sizes. In the
worst case this could have lead to overwritten data in the
<br>
destination file on a later incremental run with the mark
(-M) option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">From version 1.3 on, safecopy
ships with a test suite that can be used to verify safecopys
behaviour in a set of test cases, simulating the combination
of bad blocks in input <br>
with different include and exclude lists, both with and
without marking. Releases are only made if safecopy passes
those test cases according to the specification.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This textual specification of
behaviour of safecopy can be found in the file
specification.txt shipped with safecopy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
--stage1 <br>
Preset to rescue most of the data fast, using no retries and
avoiding bad areas.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Presets: -f 10% -r 10% -R 1 -Z 0
-L 2 -M BaDbLoCk -o stage1.badblocks</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--stage2 <br>
Preset to rescue more data, using no retries but searching
for exact ends of bad areas.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Presets: -f 128* -r 1* -R 1 -Z 0
-L 2 -I stage1.badblocks -o stage2.badblocks</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--stage3 <br>
Preset to rescue everything that can be rescued using
maximum retries, head realignment tricks and low level
access.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Presets: -f 1* -r 1* -R 4 -Z 1
-L 2 -I stage2.badblocks -o stage3.badblocks</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All stage presets can be
overridden by individual options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b &lt;size&gt; <br>
Blocksize for default read operations. Set this to the
physical sectorsize of your media.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default: 1* <br>
Hardware block size if reported by OS, otherwise 4096</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f &lt;size&gt; <br>
Blocksize in bytes when skipping over badblocks. Higher
settings put less strain on your hardware, but you might
miss good areas in between two bad ones.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default: 16*</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r &lt;size&gt; <br>
Resolution in bytes when searching for the exact beginning
or end of a bad area. If you read data directly from a
device there is no need to set this lower than the
hard&acirc; <br>
ware blocksize. On mounted filesystems however, read blocks
and physical blocks could be misaligned. Smaller values lead
to very thorough attempts to read data at the <br>
edge of damaged areas, but increase the strain on the
damaged media.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default: 1*</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R &lt;number&gt; <br>
At least that many read attempts are made on the first bad
block of a damaged area with minimum resolution. More
retries can sometimes recover a weak sector, but at the <br>
cost of additional strain.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default: 3</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Z &lt;number&gt; <br>
On each error, force seek the read head from start to end of
the source device as often as specified. That takes time,
creates additional strain and might not be sup&acirc; <br>
ported by all devices or drivers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default: 1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L &lt;mode&gt; <br>
Use low level device calls as specified:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 Do not use low level device
calls <br>
1 Attempt low level device calls for error recovery only
<br>
2 Always use low level device calls if available</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Supported low level features in
this version are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYSTEM DEVICE TYPE FEATURE <br>
Linux cdrom/dvd bus/device reset <br>
Linux cdrom read sector in raw mode <br>
Linux floppy controller reset, twaddle</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default: 1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--sync Use synchronized read
calls (disable driver buffering). Safecopy will use O_DIRECT
if supported by the OS and O_SYNC otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default: Asynchronous read
buffering by the OS is allowed</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--forceopen <br>
Keep trying to reopen the source after a read errer useful
for USB drives that go away temporarily.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning: This can cause safecopy
to hang until aborted manually!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default: Abort on fopen()
error</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s &lt;blocks&gt; <br>
Start position where to start reading. Will correspond to
position 0 in the destination file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default: block 0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l &lt;blocks&gt; <br>
Maximum length of data to be read.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default: Entire size of input
file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I &lt;badblockfile&gt; <br>
Incremental mode. Assume the target file already exists and
has holes specified in the badblockfile. It will be
attempted to retrieve more data from the listed blocks or
<br>
from beyond the file size of the target file only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning: Without this option,
the destination file will be emptied prior to writing. Use
-I /dev/null if you want to continue a previous run of
safecopy without a bad&acirc; <br>
block list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Implies: -c 0 if -c is not
specified</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default: none ( /dev/null if -c
is given )</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i &lt;bytes&gt; <br>
Blocksize to interpret the badblockfile given with -I.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default: Blocksize as specified
by -b</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c &lt;blocks&gt; <br>
Continue copying at this position. This allows continuing if
the output is a block device with a fixed size as opposed to
a growable file, where safecopy cannot determine <br>
how far it already got. The blocksize used is the same as
for the -I option. <br>
-c 0 will continue at the current destination size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Implies: -I /dev/null if -I is
not specified</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default: none ( 0 if -I is given
)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X &lt;badblockfile&gt; <br>
Exclusion mode. If used together with -I, excluded blocks
override included blocks. Safecopy will not read or write
any data from areas covered by exclude blocks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default: none</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x &lt;bytes&gt; <br>
Blocksize to interpret the badblockfile given with -X.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default: Blocksize as specified
by -b</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o &lt;badblockfile&gt; <br>
Write a badblocks/e2fsck compatible bad block file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default: none</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S &lt;seekscript&gt; <br>
Use external script for seeking in input file. (Might be
useful for tape devices and similar). Seekscript must be an
executable that takes the number of blocks to be <br>
skipped as argv1 (1-64) the blocksize in bytes as argv2 and
the current position (in bytes) as argv3. Return value needs
to be the number of blocks successfully skipped, <br>
or 0 to indicate seek failure. The external seekscript will
only be used if lseek() fails and we need to skip over
data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default: none</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M &lt;string&gt; <br>
Mark unrecovered data with this string instead of skipping
it. This helps in later finding corrupted files on rescued
file system images. The default is to zero unread&acirc;
<br>
able data on creation of output files, and leaving the data
as it is on any later run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning: When used in
combination with incremental mode (-I) this may overwrite
data in any block that occurs in the -I file. Blocks not in
the -I file, or covered by the <br>
file specified with -X are save from being overwritten.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default: none</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--debug &lt;level&gt; <br>
Enable debug output. Level is a bit field, add values
together for more information: <br>
program flow: 1 <br>
IO control: 2 <br>
badblock marking: 4 <br>
seeking: 8 <br>
incremental mode: 16 <br>
exclude mode: 32 <br>
or for all debug output: 255</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default: 0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T &lt;timingfile&gt; <br>
Write sector read timing information into this file for
later analysis.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default: none</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Show the program help text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PARAMETERS <br>
valid parameters for -f -r -b &lt;size&gt; options are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;integer&gt; <br>
Amount in bytes - i.e. 1024</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;percentage&gt;% <br>
Percentage of whole file/device size - e.g. 10%</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;number&gt;* <br>
-b only, number times blocksize reported by OS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;number&gt;* <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOWTO <br>
How do I...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- resurrect a file from a
mounted but damaged media, that copy will fail on: <br>
safecopy /path/to/problemfile ~/saved-file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- create an filesystem image of
a damaged disk/cdrom: <br>
safecopy /dev/device ~/diskimage</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- resurrect data as thoroughly
as possible?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">safecopy source dest -f 1* -R 8
-Z 2 <br>
(assuming logical misalignment of blocks to sectors)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">safecopy source dest -f 1* -r 1
-R 8 -Z 2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- resurrect data as fast as
possible, or</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- resurrect data with low risk
of damaging the media further: <br>
(you can use even higher values for -f and -r)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">safecopy source dest -f 10% -R 0
-Z 0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- resurrect some data fast, then
read more data thoroughly later:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">safecopy source dest -f 10% -R 0
-Z 0 -o badblockfile <br>
safecopy source dest -f 1* -R 8 -Z 2 -I badblockfile</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alternate approach using the new
preset features:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">safecopy source dest
--stage1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">safecopy source dest
--stage2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">safecopy source dest
--stage3</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- utilize some friends CD-ROM
drives to complete the data from my damaged CD: <br>
safecopy /dev/mydrive imagefile &lt;someoptions&gt; -b
&lt;myblocksize&gt; -o myblockfile <br>
safecopy /dev/otherdrive imagefile &lt;someoptions&gt; -b
&lt;otherblocksize&gt; -I myblockfile -i &lt;myblocksize&gt;
-o otherblockfile <br>
safecopy /dev/anotherdrive imagefile &lt;someoptions&gt; -b
&lt;anotherblocksize&gt; -I otherblockfile -i
&lt;otherblocksize&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- interrupt and later resume a
data rescue operation: <br>
safecopy source dest <br>
&lt;CTRL+C&gt; (safecopy aborts) <br>
safecopy source dest -I /dev/null</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- interrupt and later resume a
data rescue operation with correct badblocks output: <br>
safecopy source dest &lt;options&gt; -o badblockfile <br>
&lt;CTRL+C&gt; (safecopy aborts) <br>
mv badblockfile savedbadblockfile <br>
safecopy source dest -I /dev/null -o badblockfile <br>
cat badblockfile &gt;&gt;savedbadblockfile</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- interrupt and resume in
incremental mode: <br>
(this needs a bit of bash scripting to get the correct
badblock lists) <br>
safecopy source dest &lt;options&gt; -o badblockfile1 <br>
safecopy source dest &lt;options&gt; -I badblockfile1 -o
badblockfile2 <br>

&gt;&gt;badblockfile2; <br>
done; <br>
safecopy source dest &lt;options&gt; -I badblockfile2 -o
badblockfile3</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- find the corrupted files on a
partially successful rescued file system: <br>
safecopy /dev/filesystem image -M CoRrUpTeD <br>
fsck image <br>
mount -o loop image /mnt/mountpoint <br>
grep -R /mnt/mountpoint &quot;CoRrUpTeD&quot; <br>
(hint: this might not find all affected files if the
unreadable parts are smaller in size than your marker
string)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- exclude the previously known
badblocks list of a filesystem from filesystem image
creation: <br>
dumpe2fs -b /dev/filesystem &gt;badblocklist <br>
safecopy /dev/filesystem image -X badblocklist -x
&lt;blocksize of your fs&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- create an image of a device
that starts at X and is Y in size: <br>
safecopy /dev/filesystem -b &lt;bsize&gt; -s &lt;X/bsize&gt;
-l &lt;Y/bsize&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- combine two partial images of
rescued data without access to the actual (damaged) source
data: <br>
(This is a bit tricky. You need to get badblocks lists for
both files somehow to make safecopy know where the missing
data is. If you used the -M (mark) feature you might <br>
be able to automatically compute these, however this feature
is not provided by safecopy. Lets assume you have two
badblocks files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">you have: <br>
image1.dat <br>
image1.badblocks (blocksize1) <br>
image2.dat <br>
image2.badblocks (blocksize2)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The file size of image1 needs to
be greater or equal to that of image2. (If not, swap them)
)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cp image2.dat combined.dat <br>
safecopy image1.dat combined.dat -I image2.badblocks -i
blocksize2 -X image1.badblocks -x blocksize1 <br>
(This gets you the combined data, but no output
badblocklist. The resulting badblocks list would be the
badblocks that are <br>
a: in both badblocks lists, or <br>
b: in image1.badblocks and beyond the file size of image2 It
should be reasonably easy to solve this logic in a short
shell script. One day this might be shipped with <br>
safecopy, until then consider this your chance to contribute
to a random open source project.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- rescue data of a tape device:
<br>
If the tape device driver supports lseek(), treat it as any
file, otherwise utilize the &quot;-S&quot; option of
safecopy with a to be self-written script to skip over the
bad <br>
blocks. (for example using &quot;mt seek&quot;) Make sure
your tape device doesn&rsquo;t auto-rewind on close. Send me
feedback if you had any luck doing so, so I can update this
docu&acirc; <br>
mentation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FAQ <br>
Q: Why create this tool if there already is something like
dd-rescue and other tools for that purpose?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A: Because I didn&rsquo;t know
of dd(-)rescue when I started, and I felt like it. Also I
think safecopy suits the needs of a user in data loss peril
better due to more readable <br>
output and more understandable options than some of the
other tools. (Then again I am biased. Compare them yourself)
Meanwhile safecopy supports low level features other <br>
tools don&rsquo;t.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Q: What exactly does the -Z
option do?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A: Remember back in MS-DOS times
when a floppy would make a &quot;neek nark&quot; sound 3
times every time when running into a read error? This
happened when the BIOS or DOS disk <br>
driver moved the IO head to its boundaries to possibly
correct small cylinder misalignment, before it tried again.
Linux doesn&rsquo;t do that by default, neither do common
<br>
CDROM drives or drivers. Nevertheless forcing this behaviour
can increase your chance of reading bad sectors from a CD
__BIG__ time. (Unlike floppies where it usually <br>
has little effect)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Q: Whats my best chance to
resurrect a CD that has become unreadable?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A: Try making a backup image on
many different computers and drives. The abilities to read
from bad media vary extremely. I have a 6 year old Lite On
CDRW drive, that even <br>
reads deeply and purposely scratched CDs (as in with my key,
to make it unreadable) flawlessly. A CDRW drive of the same
age at work doesn&rsquo;t read any data from that part <br>
of the CD at all, while most DVD and combo drives have bad
blocks every couple hundred bytes. Make full use of
safecopys RAW access features if applicable. (-L 2
option)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As a general guideline: -CDRW
drives usually do better than read-only CD drives. <br>
-CD only drives sometimes do better on CDs than DVD drives.
<br>
-PC drives are sometimes better than laptop ones. <br>
-A drive with a clean lens does better than a dirtball. <br>
-Cleaning up CDs helps. <br>
-Unless you use chemicals. <br>
-Using sticky tape on a CD will rip of the reflective layer
permanently rendering the disk unreadable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Q: Whats my best chance to
resurrect a floppy that became unreadable?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A: Again try different floppy
drives. Keep in mind that it might be easier to further
damage data on a bad floppy than on a CD. (Don&rsquo;t
overdo read attempts)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Q: What about BlueRay/HDDVD
disks?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A: Hell if I knew, but generally
they should be similar to DVDs. It probably depends how the
drives firmware acts up.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Q: My hard drive suddenly has
many bad sectors, what should I do?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A: Speed is an essential factor
when rescuing data from a bad hard drive. Accesses to bad
areas or even just time running can further damage the drive
and make formerly <br>
readable areas unreadable, be it due to temperature rise,
damaged heads scratching still good parts of the surface,
bearings degrading due to vibration, etc. Its advis&acirc;
<br>
able to shut the system down and remove the hard drive from
the computer as soon as errors occur and as fast as possible
without causing further damage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(Don&rsquo;t pull the plug!
Press reset to force reboot and then power down via power
button/ACPI)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Set up a rescue system with
enough disk space to store all the data from the damaged
drive (and possibly multiple copies of it). If you have an
external hard drive case <br>
that connects via USB SATA or SCSI, allowing a hot plug of
the drive into a running system, use it. This allows you to
prepare everything without the need for the drive <br>
to power up and possibly BIOS or operating system
involuntarily accessing it. You also get easier access to
the drive to check temperature or noise during
operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When you rescue data, rescue
good data first before attempting to access bad sectors.
Safecopy allows you to skip known problem sectors using a
badblock exclude file (-X) <br>
which you might be able to retrieve from system logs or from
the drive internal logs, via smartmontools or similar
software. Be aware that you might possibly need to
con&acirc; <br>
vert physical sector numbers into logical block numbers
depending on your source.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also you should tell safecopy to
jump out of any problematic areas ASAP and continue
somewhere else. Parameters &quot;-f 10% -r 10% -R 0 -Z
0&quot; would do the trick by making <br>
safecopy skip 10% of the device content and continue there
without backtracking. You can always attempt to get the data
in between later, first get the supposedly good <br>
data on the rest of the drive. Depending on the method of
data recovery you plan on using, it may make sense to mark
the bad data with the &quot;-M&quot; option. This allows you
to <br>
later find files affected by data corruption more easily.
Use the &quot;-o&quot; option to make safecopy write a
badblock list with all blocks skipped or unreadable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When safecopy is done with this
first run, you can attempt a second go trying to get more
data. Using smaller values for &quot;-f&quot; and allowing
safecopy to backtrack for the <br>
end of the affected area &quot;-r 1*&quot;. Be sure to use
incremental mode &quot;-I&quot; to only read the blocks
skipped in the first run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It may make sense to let the
drive cool down between runs. Once you got all the data from
the &quot;good&quot; areas of the drive you can risk more
&quot;thorough&quot; access to it. <br>
Increase the numbers of retries &quot;-R&quot; in case of
bad blocks, maybe together with a head realignment &quot;-Z
1&quot;. &quot;-f 1*&quot; would make safecopy try to read
on every single block, <br>
not skipping over bad areas at all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If your drive stops responding,
power it down, let it cool down for a while, then try
again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(I heard from people who brought
dead drives back to live for a short time by cooling them to
low temperatures with ice-packs.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">!!! If the data is really
important, go to a professional data recovery specialist
right away, before doing further damage to the drive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
safecopy returns 0 (zero) if there were no unrecoverable
errors. <br>
safecopy returns 1 if some data could not be recovered. <br>
safecopy returns 2 in case the copying was aborted due to
error or signal.</p>
