This program is part of <b>Netpbm</b>(1)
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>pnmnorm</b> reads a PNM image (PBM, PGM, or PPM). It normalizes the contrast
  by forcing the brightest pixels to white, the darkest pixels to black, and
  spreading out the ones in between. It produces the same kind of file as
  output. This is pretty useless for a PBM image.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The program offers two ways of spreading out the pixels in between the darkest
  and brightest: linear and quadratic. In the quadratic case, you specify some
  in between brightness and specify what brightness that should become in the
  output. With those three constraints: the brightness that becomes black, the
  brightness that becomes white, and the brightness that becomes that middle
  value, <b>pnmnorm</b> computes a quadratic equation that maps all the other
  brightnesses from input values to output values.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The program first determines a mapping of old brightness to new brightness. For
  each possible brightness of a pixel, the program determines a corresponding
  brightness for the output image.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Then for each pixel in the image, the program computes a color which has the
  desired output brightness and puts that in the output. With a color image, it
  is not always possible to compute such a color and retain any semblance of the
  original hue, so the brightest and dimmest pixels may only approximate the
  desired brightness.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For a PPM image, you have a choice of three ways to define brightness:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">luminosity</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">color value</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">saturation
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    In the case of saturation, 'brightness' is pretty much a misnomer, but you
      can use the brightness analogy to see what it does. In the analogy, bright
      means saturated and dark means unsaturated.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that all of these are different from separately normalizing the individual
  color components.
<div class="Pp"></div>
An alternative way to spread out the brightnesses in an image is
  <b>pnmhisteq</b>. <b>pnmhisteq</b> stretches the brightest pixels to white and
  the darkest pixels to black, but rather than linearly adjusting the ones in
  between, it adjusts them so that there are an equal number of pixels of each
  brightness throughout the range. This gives you more contrast than
  <b>pnmnorm</b> does, but can considerably change the picture in exchange.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
By default, the darkest 2 percent of all pixels are mapped to black, and the
  brightest 1 percent are mapped to white. You can override these percentages by
  using the <b>-bpercent</b> and <b>-wpercent</b> options, or you can specify
  the exact pixel values to be mapped by using the <b>-bvalue</b> and
  <b>-wvalue</b> options. You can get appropriate numbers for the options from
  <b>ppmhist</b>. If you just want to enhance the contrast, then choose values
  at elbows in the histogram; e.g. if value 29 represents 3% of the image but
  value 30 represents 20%, choose 30 for <i>bvalue</i>. If you want to brighten
  the image, then set <i>bvalue</i> to 0 and just fiddle with <i>wvalue</i>;
  similarly, to darken the image, set <i>wvalue</i> to maxval and play with
  <i>bvalue</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you specify both <b>-bvalue</b> and <b>-bpercent</b>, <b>pnmnorm</b> uses the
  one that produces the least change. The same goes for <b>-wvalue</b> and
  <b>-wpercent</b>. (In Netpbm 10.26 (January 2005), the
  <b>-bvalue</b>/<b>-wvalue</b> takes precedence, and before that, it's a syntax
  error to specify both).
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you want to maximize the change instead of minimizing it, just cascade two
  runs of <b>pnmnorm</b>, specifying values for the first and percentages for
  the second.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-bpercent</b> and <b>-wpercent</b> values are floating point decimal. Zero is
  valid and is the same as <b>-bvalue=0</b> or <b>-wvalue=</b><i>maxval</i>,
  respectively.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Because there are whole numbers of pixels at each brightness, <b>pnmnorm</b>
  obviously can't guarantee the exact percentage, so it arranges that <i>at
  least</i> the percentage of pixels you specify get remapped as promised.
<div class="Pp"></div>
It is possible for your <b>-bpercent</b> or <b>-wpercent</b> to overlap your
  <b>-wvalue</b> or <b>-bvalue</b>, respectively. For example, you say
  <b>-bpercent=20</b> and <b>-wvalue=100</b> for an image in which only 10
  percent of the pixels are darker than 100. In that case, <b>pnmnorm</b>
  adjusts the percentile value as required. In the example, it uses 99 as the
  black value (like <b>-bvalue=99</b>).
<div class="Pp"></div>
It is also possible for your <b>-bpercent</b> and <b>-wpercent</b> options to
  select the same brightness value for the stretch-to-white and stretch-to-black
  value because of the fact that <b>pnmnorm</b> can't subdivide a histogram
  cell. E.g. if an image is all brightness 100, then no matter what
  <b>-bpercent</b> and <b>-wpercent</b> values you choose, it's the same as
  saying <b>-bvalue=100 -wvalue=100</b>. In that case, <b>pnmnorm</b> changes
  one of the values by 1 to make it legal. In the example, <b>pnmnorm</b> would
  either make the black value 99 or the white value 101.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Before Netpbm 10.43 (June 2008), <b>pnmnorm</b> fails if the <b>-wpercent</b>
  and/or <b>-bpercent</b> values specify an overlap.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The stretch points are further constrained by the <b>-maxexpand</b> option.
  Sometimes, too much contrast is a bad thing. If your intensities are all
  concentrated in the middle, <b>-bpercent=2</b> and <b>-wpercent=1</b> might
  mean that an intensity of 60 gets stretched up to 100 and intensity of 20 gets
  stretched down to zero, for a range expansion of 150% (from a range of 40 to a
  range of 100). That much stretching means two adjacent pixels that used to
  differ in intensity by 4 units now differ by 10, and that might be unsightly.
<div class="Pp"></div>
So that you can put a limit on the amount of expansion without having to examine
  the image first, there is the <b>-maxexpand</b> option. It specifies the
  maximum expansion you will tolerate, as an additional percentage. In the
  example above, you could say <b>-maxexpand=50</b> to say you want the range to
  expand by at most 50%, regardless of your other options. <b>pnmnorm</b>
  figures out what intensity to stretch to full intensity and what intensity to
  stretch to zero intensity as described above, and then raises the former and
  lowers the latter as needed to limit the expansion to the amount you
  specified.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When <b>pnmnorm</b> limits the expansion due to <b>-maxexpand</b>, it tells you
  about it with a message like this:
<pre>
    limiting expansion of 150% to 50%
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
In any case, <b>pnmnorm</b> tells you exactly what expansion it's doing, like
  this:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
    remapping 25..75 to 0..100
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Before Netpbm 10.26 (December 2004), it was not valid to specify both
  <b>-bvalue</b> and <b>-bpercent</b> or <b>-wvalue</b> and <b>-wpercent</b>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-maxexpand</b> was new in Netpbm 10.32 (February 2006).
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-keephues</b> option says to keep each pixel the same hue as it is in the
  input; just adjust its brightness. You normally want this; the only reason it
  is not the default behavior is backward compatibility with a design mistake.
<div class="Pp"></div>
By default, <b>pnmnorm</b> normalizes contrast in each component independently
  (except that the meaning of the <b>-wpercent</b> and <b>-bpercent</b> options
  are based on the overall brightnesses of the colors, not each component taken
  separately). So if you have a color which is intensely red but dimly green,
  <b>pnmnorm</b> would make the red more intense and the green less intense, so
  you end up with a different hue than you started with.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When you specify <b>-midvalue=</b><i>N</i>, <b>pnmnorm</b> uses a quadratic
  function to map old brightnesses to new ones, making sure that an old
  brightness of <i>N</i> becomes 50% bright in the output. You can override that
  50% default with <b>-middle</b>. The value of <b>-middle</b> is a floating
  point number in the range 0 through 1 with 0 being full darkness and 1 full
  brightness. If your <b>-midvalue</b> and <b>-middle</b> indicate an ambiguous
  or impossible quadratic function (e.g. <b>-midvalue</b> is the same as
  <b>-bvalue</b>, so an infinite number of quadratic functions fit),
  <b>pnmnorm</b> just ignores your <b>-midvalue</b> and maps linearly.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>-midvalue</b> and <b>-middle</b> were new in Netpbm 10.57 (December 2011).
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you specify <b>-keephues</b>, <b>pnmnorm</b> would likely leave this pixel
  alone, since its overall brightness is medium.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-keephues</b> can cause clipping, because a certain color may be below a
  target intensity while one of its components is saturated. Where that's the
  case, <b>pnmnorm</b> uses the maximum representable intensity for the
  saturated component and the pixel ends up with less overall intensity, and a
  different hue, than it is supposed to have.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This option is meaningless on grayscale images.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When you <i>don't</i> specify <b>-keephues</b>, the <b>-luminosity</b>,
  <b>-colorvalue</b>, and <b>-saturation</b> options affect the transfer
  function (which is the same for all three RGB components), but are meaningless
  when it comes to applying the transfer function (since it is applied to each
  individual RGB component).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Before Netpbm 9.25 (March 2002), there was no <b>-keephues</b> option.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-luminosity</b>, <b>-colorvalue</b>, and <b>-saturation</b> determine what
  property of the pixels <b>pnmnorm</b> normalizes. I.e., what kind of
  brightness. You cannot specify more than one of these.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-luminosity</b> option says to use the luminosity (i.e. the 'Y' in the
  YUV or YCbCr color space) as the pixel's brightness. The luminosity is a
  measure of how bright a human eye would find the color, taking into account
  the fact that the human eye is more sensitive to some RGB components than
  others.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This option is default.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This option is meaningless on grayscale images.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Before Netpbm 10.28 (August 2005), there was no <b>-luminosity</b> option, but
  its meaning was still the default.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Before Netpbm 10.28 (August 2005), there was no <b>-colorvalue</b> option.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-colorvalue</b> option says to use the color value (i.e. the 'V' in the
  HSV color space) as the pixel's brightness. The color value is the
  gamma-adjusted intensity of the most intense RGB component.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This option is meaningless on grayscale images.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Before Netpbm 10.28 (August 2005), there was no <b>-colorvalue</b> option.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-saturation</b> option says to use the saturation (i.e. the 'S' in the
  HSV color space) as the pixel's brightness. The saturation is the ratio of the
  intensity of the most intense RGB component to the difference between the
  intensities of the most and least intense RGB component (all intensities
  gamma-adjusted).
<div class="Pp"></div>
In this case, 'brightness' is more of a metaphor than anything. 'bright' means
  saturated and 'dark' means unsaturated.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This option is meaningless on grayscale images.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Before Netpbm 10.28 (August 2005), there was no <b>-colorvalue</b> option.
