<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: No space is allowed
between the option flag and the associated arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
grdimage reads one 2-D grid file and produces a gray-shaded
(or colored) map by plotting rectangles centered on each
grid node and assigning them a gray-shade (or color) based
on <br>
the z-value. Alternatively, grdimage reads three 2-D grid
files with the red, green, and blue components directly (all
must be in the 0-255 range). Optionally, illumination may
<br>
be added by providing a file with intensities in the (-1,+1)
range. Values outside this range will be clipped. Such
intensity files can be created from the grid using
grdgradient <br>
and, optionally, modified by grdmath or grdhisteq. Yet as a
third alternative available when GMT is build with GDAL
support the grd_z file can be an image referenced or not
(than <br>
see -Dr). In this case the images can be illuminated with
the file provided via the -I option. Here if image has no
coordinates those of the intensity file will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When using map projections, the
grid is first resampled on a new rectangular grid with the
same dimensions. Higher resolution images can be obtained by
using the -E option. To <br>
obtain the resampled value (and hence shade or color) of
each map pixel, its location is inversely projected back
onto the input grid after which a value is interpolated
between <br>
the surrounding input grid values. By default bi-cubic
interpolation is used. Aliasing is avoided by also forward
projecting the input grid nodes. If two or more nodes are
pro&acirc; <br>
jected onto the same pixel, their average will dominate in
the calculation of the pixel value. Interpolation and
aliasing is controlled with the -n option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -R option can be used to
select a map region larger or smaller than that implied by
the extent of the grid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A (color) PostScript file is
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REQUIRED ARGUMENTS <br>
grd_z | grd_r grd_g grd_b <br>
2-D gridded data set (or red, green, blue grids) to be
imaged (See GRID FILE FORMATS below.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Jparameters (more
&acirc;&brvbar;) <br>
Select map projection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS <br>
-Aout_img[=driver] <br>
Save an image in a raster format instead of PostScript. Use
extension Append out_img to select the image file name and
extension. If the extension is one of .bmp, .gif, <br>
.jpg, .png, or .tif then no driver information is required.
For other output formats you must append the required GDAL
driver. The driver is the driver code name used by <br>
GDAL; see your GDAL installation&acirc;s documentation for
available drivers. Notes: (1) If a tiff file (.tif) is
selected then we will write a GeoTiff image if the GMT
projec&acirc; <br>
tion syntax translates into a PROJ4 syntax, otherwise a
plain tiff file is produced. (2) Any vector elements will be
lost.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B[p|s]parameters (more
&acirc;&brvbar;) <br>
Set map boundary frame and axes attributes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Ccpt Name of the CPT (for grd_z
only). Alternatively, supply the name of a GMT color master
dynamic CPT [rainbow] to automatically determine a
continuous CPT from the grid&acirc;s <br>
z-range. If the dynamic CPT has a default range then that
range will be imposed instead. Yet another option is to
specify -Ccolor1,color2[,color3,&acirc;&brvbar;] to build a
linear <br>
continuous CPT from those colors automatically. In this case
color1 etc can be a r/g/b triplet, a color name, or an HTML
hexadecimal color (e.g. #aabbcc ).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D[r] Specifies that the grid
supplied is an image file to be read via GDAL. Obviously
this option will work only with GMT versions built with GDAL
support. The image can be <br>
indexed or true color (RGB) and can be an URL of a remotely
located file. That is -D http://www.somewhere.com/image.jpg
is a valid file syntax. Note, however, that to use <br>
it this way you must not be blocked by a proxy. If you are,
chances are good that it can work by setting the
environmental variable http_proxy with the value <br>
&acirc;your_proxy:port&acirc; Append r to use the region
specified by -R to apply to the image. For example, if you
have used -Rd then the image will be assigned the limits of
a <br>
global domain. The interest of this mode is that you can
project a raw image (an image without referencing
coordinates).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E[i|dpi] <br>
Sets the resolution of the projected grid that will be
created if a map projection other than Linear or Mercator
was selected [100]. By default, the projected grid will be
<br>
of the same size (rows and columns) as the input file.
Specify i to use the PostScript image operator to
interpolate the image at the device resolution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-G[f|b]color <br>
This option only applies when the resulting image otherwise
would consist of only two colors: black (0) and white (255).
If so, this option will instead use the image as a <br>
transparent mask and paint the mask (or its inverse, with
-Gb) with the given color combination.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I[intensfile|intensity|modifiers]
<br>
Gives the name of a grid file with intensities in the
(-1,+1) range, or a constant intensity to apply everywhere;
this simply affects the ambient light. If just + is <br>
given then we derive an intensity grid from the input data
grid grd_z via a call to grdgradient using the arguments
-A-45 and -Nt1 for that module. You can append +aaz&acirc;
<br>
imuth and **+n*args to override those values. If you want
more specific intensities then run grdgradient separately
first. [Default is no illumination].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Jz|Zparameters (more
&acirc;&brvbar;) <br>
Set z-axis scaling; same syntax as -Jx.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-K (more &acirc;&brvbar;) <br>
Do not finalize the PostScript plot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M Force conversion to
monochrome image using the (television) YIQ transformation.
Cannot be used with -Q.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N Do not clip the image at the
map boundary (only relevant for non-rectangular maps).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O (more &acirc;&brvbar;) <br>
Append to existing PostScript plot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P (more &acirc;&brvbar;) <br>
Select &acirc;Portrait&acirc; plot orientation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Q Make grid nodes with z = NaN
transparent, using the colormasking feature in PostScript
Level 3 (the PS device must support PS Level 3).</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Rxmin/xmax/ymin/ymax[+r][+uunit]
(more &acirc;&brvbar;) <br>
Specify the region of interest.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For perspective view p,
optionally append /zmin/zmax. (more &acirc;&brvbar;) You may
ask for a larger w/e/s/n region to have more room between
the image and the axes. A smaller region than <br>
specified in the grid file will result in a subset of the
grid [Default is the region given by the grid file].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U[[just]/dx/dy/][c|label] (more
&acirc;&brvbar;) <br>
Draw GMT time stamp logo on plot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V[level] (more &acirc;&brvbar;)
<br>
Select verbosity level [c].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X[a|c|f|r][x-shift[u]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Y[a|c|f|r][y-shift[u]] (more
&acirc;&brvbar;) <br>
Shift plot origin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f[i|o]colinfo (more
&acirc;&brvbar;) <br>
Specify data types of input and/or output columns.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n[b|c|l|n][+a][+bBC][+c][+tthreshold]
(more &acirc;&brvbar;) <br>
Select interpolation mode for grids.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p[x|y|z]azim[/elev[/zlevel]][+wlon0/lat0[/z0]][+vx0/y0]
(more &acirc;&brvbar;) <br>
Select perspective view.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t[transp] (more
&acirc;&brvbar;) <br>
Set PDF transparency level in percent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-^ or just - <br>
Print a short message about the syntax of the command, then
exits (NOTE: on Windows just use -).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-+ or just + <br>
Print an extensive usage (help) message, including the
explanation of any module-specific option (but not the GMT
common options), then exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-? or no arguments <br>
Print a complete usage (help) message, including the
explanation of all options, then exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GRID FILE FORMATS <br>
By default GMT writes out grid as single precision floats in
a COARDS-complaint netCDF file format. However, GMT is able
to produce grid files in many other commonly used grid <br>
file formats and also facilitates so called
&acirc;packing&acirc; of grids, writing out floating point
data as 1- or 2-byte integers. (more &acirc;&brvbar;)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IMAGING GRIDS WITH NANS <br>
Be aware that if your input grid contains patches of NaNs,
these patches can become larger as a consequence of the
resampling that must take place with most map projections.
<br>
Because grdimage uses the PostScript colorimage operator,
for most non-linear projections we must resample your grid
onto an equidistant rectangular lattice. If you find that
the <br>
NaN areas are not treated adequately, consider (a) use a
linear projection, or (b) use grdview -Ts instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONSEQUENCES OF GRID RESAMPLING
<br>
Except for Cartesian cases, we need to resample your
geographic grid onto an equidistant projected grid. In doing
so various algorithms come into play that projects data from
one <br>
lattice to another while avoiding anti-aliasing, leading to
possible distortions. One expected effect of resampling with
splines is the tendency for the new resampled grid to <br>
slightly exceed the global min/max limits of the original
grid. If this is coupled with tight CPT limits you may find
that some map areas may show up with fore- or background
<br>
color due to the resampling. In that case you have two
options: (1) Modify your CPT to fit the resampled extrema
(reported with -V) or (2) Impose clipping of resampled
values so <br>
they do not exceed the input min/max values (add +c to your
-n option).</p>
