<p>PMLOGEXTRACT(1) General Commands Manual
PMLOGEXTRACT(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pmlogextract - reduce, extract, concatenate and merge
Performance Co-Pilot archives</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pmlogextract [-dfwz] [-c configfile] [-S starttime] [-s
samples] [-T endtime] [-v volsamples] [-Z timezone] input
[...] output</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
pmlogextract reads one or more Performance Co-Pilot (PCP)
archive logs identified by input and creates a temporally
merged and/or reduced PCP archive log in output. input is a
<br>
comma-separated list of names, each of which may be the base
name of an archive or the name of a directory containing one
or more archives. The nature of merging is controlled <br>
by the number of input archive logs, while the nature of
data reduction is controlled by the command line arguments.
The input(s) must be sets of PCP archive logs created by
<br>
pmlogger(1) with performance data collected from the same
host, but usually over different time periods and possibly
(although not usually) with different performance metrics
<br>
being logged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If only one input is specified,
then the default behavior simply copies the input set of PCP
archive logs, into the output PCP archive log. When two or
more sets of PCP archive <br>
logs are specified as input, the sets of logs are merged (or
concatenated) and written to output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the output archive log a
&lt;mark&gt; record will be inserted at a time just past the
end of each of the input archive logs to indicate a possible
temporal discontinuity between the <br>
end of one input archive log and the start of the next input
archive log. See the MARK RECORDS section below for more
information. There is no &lt;mark&gt; record after the end
of <br>
the last (in temporal order) of the input archive logs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMAND LINE OPTIONS <br>
The command line options for pmlogextract are as
follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c configfile <br>
Extract only the metrics specified in configfile from the
input PCP archive log(s). The configfile syntax accepted by
pmlogextract is explained in more detail in the Con&acirc;
<br>
figuration File Syntax section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Desperate mode. Normally if a
fatal error occurs, all trace of the partially written PCP
archive output is removed. With the -d option, the output
archive log is not <br>
removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f For most common uses, all of
the input archive logs will have been collected in the same
timezone. But if this is not the case, then pmlogextract
must choose one of the <br>
timezones from the input archive logs to be used as the
timezone for the output archive log. The default is to use
the timezone from the last input archive log. The -f <br>
option forces the timezone from the first input archive log
to be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S starttime <br>
Define the start of a time window to restrict the samples
retrieved or specify a &lsquo;&lsquo;natural&rsquo;&rsquo;
alignment of the output sample times; refer to PCPIntro(1).
See also the -w <br>
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s samples <br>
The argument samples defines the number of samples to be
written to output. If samples is 0 or -s is not specified,
pmlogextract will sample until the end of the PCP ar&acirc;
<br>
chive log, or the end of the time window as specified by -T,
whichever comes first. The -s option will override the -T
option if it occurs sooner.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T endtime <br>
Define the termination of a time window to restrict the
samples retrieved or specify a
&lsquo;&lsquo;natural&rsquo;&rsquo; alignment of the output
sample times; refer to PCPIntro(1). See also <br>
the -w option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v volsamples <br>
The output archive log is potentially a multi-volume data
set, and the -v option causes pmlogextract to start a new
volume after volsamples log records have been written <br>
to the archive log.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Independent of any -v option,
each volume of an archive is limited to no more than 2^31
bytes, so pmlogextract will automatically create a new
volume for the archive <br>
before this limit is reached.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w Where -S and -T specify a
time window within the same day, the -w flag will cause the
data within the time window to be extracted, for every day
in the archive log. For <br>
example, the options -w -S @11:00 -T @15:00 specify that
pmlogextract should include archive log records only for the
periods from 11am to 3pm on each day. When -w is <br>
used, the output archive log will contain &lt;mark&gt;
records to indicate the temporal discontinuity between the
end of one time window and the start of the next.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Z timezone <br>
Use timezone when displaying the date and time. Timezone is
in the format of the environment variable TZ as described in
environ(7).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z Use the local timezone of the
host from the input archive logs. The default is to
initially use the timezone of the local host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION FILE SYNTAX <br>
The configfile contains metrics of interest - only those
metrics (or instances) mentioned explicitly or implicitly in
the configuration file will be included in the output
ar&acirc; <br>
chive. Each specifications must begin on a new line, and may
span multiple lines in the configuration file. Instances may
also be specified, but they are optional. The format <br>
for each specification is</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">metric
[[instance[,instance...]]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where metric may be a leaf or a
non-leaf name in the Performance Metrics Name Space (PMNS,
see pmns(5)). If a metric refers to a non-leaf node in the
PMNS, pmlogextract will <br>
recursively descend the PMNS and include all metrics
corresponding to descendent leaf nodes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Instances are optional, and may
be specified as a list of one or more space (or comma)
separated names, numbers or strings (enclosed in single or
double quotes). Elements in the <br>
list that are numbers are assumed to be internal instance
identifiers - see pmGetInDom(3) for more information. If no
instances are given, then all instances of the associated
<br>
metric(s) will be extracted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any additional white space is
ignored and comments may be added with a &lsquo;#&rsquo;
prefix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION FILE EXAMPLE <br>
This is an example of a valid configfile:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># <br>
# config file for pmlogextract <br>
#</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kernel.all.cpu <br>
kernel.percpu.cpu.sys [&quot;cpu0&quot;,&quot;cpu1&quot;]
<br>
disk.dev [&quot;dks0d1&quot;]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MARK RECORDS <br>
When more than one input archive log contributes performance
data to the output archive log, then &lt;mark&gt; records
are inserted to indicate a possible discontinuity in the
perfor&acirc; <br>
mance data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A &lt;mark&gt; record contains a
timestamp and no performance data and is used to indicate
that there is a time period in the PCP archive log where we
do not know the values of any <br>
performance metrics, because there was no pmlogger(1)
collecting performance data during this period. Since these
periods are often associated with the restart of a service
or <br>
pmcd(1) or a system, there may be considerable doubt as to
the continuity of performance data across this time
period.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The rationale behind
&lt;mark&gt; records may be demonstrated with an example.
Consider one input archive log that starts at 00:10 and ends
at 09:15 on the same day, and another input <br>
archive log that starts at 09:20 on the same day and ends at
00:10 the following morning. This would be a very common
case for archives managed and rotated by pmlogger_check(1)
<br>
and pmlogger_daily(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The output archive log created
by pmlogextract would contain: <br>
00:10.000 first record from first input archive log <br>
... <br>
09:15.000 last record from first input archive log <br>
09:15.001 &lt;mark&gt; record <br>
09:20.000 first record from second input archive log <br>
... <br>
01:10.000 last record from second input archive log</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The time period where the
performance data is missing starts just after 09:15 and ends
just before 09:20. When the output archive log is processed
with any of the PCP reporting <br>
tools, the &lt;mark&gt; record is used to indicate a period
of missing data. For example using the output archive above,
imagine one was reporting the average I/O rate at 30 minute
<br>
intervals aligned on the hour and half-hour. The I/O count
metric is a counter, so the average I/O rate requires two
valid values from consecutive sample times. There would be
<br>
values for all the intervals ending at 09:00, then no values
at 09:30 because of the &lt;mark&gt; record, then no values
at 10:00 because the &lsquo;&lsquo;prior&rsquo;&rsquo; value
at 09:30 is not available, <br>
then the rate would be reported again at 10:30 and continue
every 30 minutes until the last reported value at 01:00.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The presence of &lt;mark&gt;
records in a PCP archive log can be established using
pmdumplog(1) where a timestamp and the annotation
&lt;mark&gt; is used to indicate a &lt;mark&gt; record.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">METADATA CHECKS <br>
When more than one input archive set is specified,
pmlogextract performs a number of checks to ensure the
metadata is consistent for metrics appearing in more than
one of the <br>
input archive sets. These checks include:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* metric data type is the same
<br>
* metric semantics are the same <br>
* metric units are the same <br>
* metric is either always singular or always has the same
instance domain <br>
* metrics with the same name have the same PMID <br>
* metrics with the same PMID have the same name</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If any of these checks fail,
pmlogextract reports the details and aborts without creating
the output archive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To address these semantic
issues, use pmlogrewrite(1) to translate the input archives
into equivalent archives with consistent metdadata before
using pmlogextract.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
For each of the input and output archive logs, several
physical files are used. <br>
archive.meta <br>
metadata (metric descriptions, instance domains, etc.) for
the archive log <br>
archive.0 initial volume of metrics values (subsequent
volumes have suffixes 1, 2, ...) - for input these files may
have been previously compressed with bzip2(1) or gzip(1) and
<br>
thus may have an additional .bz2 or .gz suffix. <br>
archive.index <br>
temporal index to support rapid random access to the other
files in the archive log.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PCP ENVIRONMENT <br>
Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP. On
each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local
<br>
values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF variable may be
used to specify an alternative configuration file, as
described in pcp.conf(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
PCPIntro(1), pmdumplog(1), pmlc(1), pmlogger(1),
pmlogreduce(1), pmlogrewrite(1), pcp.conf(5) and
pcp.env(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
All error conditions detected by pmlogextract are reported
on stderr with textual (if sometimes terse) explanation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Should one of the input archive
logs be corrupted (this can happen if the pmlogger instance
writing the log suddenly dies), then pmlogextract will
detect and report the position <br>
of the corruption in the file, and any subsequent
information from that archive log will not be processed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If any error is detected,
pmlogextract will exit with a non-zero status.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CAVEATS <br>
The preamble metrics (pmcd.pmlogger.archive,
pmcd.pmlogger.host, and pmcd.pmlogger.port), which are
automatically recorded by pmlogger at the start of the
archive, may not be <br>
present in the archive output by pmlogextract. These metrics
are only relevant while the archive is being created, and
have no significance once recording has finished.</p>
