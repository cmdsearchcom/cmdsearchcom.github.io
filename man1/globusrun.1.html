<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The globusrun program for submits and manages jobs run on a
local or remote job host. The jobs are controlled by the
globus-job-manager program which interfaces with a local
<br>
resource manager that schedules and executes the job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The globusrun program can be run
in a number of different modes chosen by command-line
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When -help, -usage, -version, or
-versions command-line options are used, globusrun will
print out diagnostic information and then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the -p or -parse
command-line option is present, globusrun will verify the
syntax of the RSL specification and then terminate. If the
syntax is valid, globusrun will print <br>
out the string RSL Parsed Successfully... and exit with a
zero exit code; otherwise, it will print an error message
and terminate with a non-zero exit code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the -a or
-authenticate-only command-line option is present, globusrun
will verify that the service named by RESOURCE exists and
the client&acirc;s credentials are granted <br>
permission to access that service. If authentication is
successful, globusrun will display the string GRAM
Authentication test successful and exit with a zero exit
code; <br>
otherwise it will print an explanation of the problem and
will with a non-zero exit code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the -j or
-jobmanager-version command-line option is present,
globusrun will attempt to determine the software version
that the service named by RESOURCE is running. If <br>
successful, it will display both the Toolkit version and the
Job Manager package version and exit with a zero exit code;
otherwise, it will print an explanation of the problem <br>
and exit with a non-zero exit code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the -k or -kill
command-line option is present, globusrun will attempt to
terminate the job named by JOB_ID. If successful, globusrun
will exit with zero; otherwise it will <br>
display an explanation of the problem and exit with a
non-zero exit code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the -y or -refresh-proxy
command-line option is present, globusrun will attempt to
delegate a new X.509 proxy to the job manager which is
managing the job named by JOBID. If <br>
successful, globusrun will exit with zero; otherwise it will
display an explanation of the problem and exit with a
non-zero exit code. This behavior can be modified by the
<br>
-full-proxy or -D command-line options to enable full proxy
delegation. The default is limited proxy delegation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the -status command-line
option is present, globusrun will attempt to determine the
current state of the job. If successful, the state will be
printed to standard output and <br>
globusrun will exit with a zero exit code; otherwise, a
description of the error will be displayed and it will exit
with a non-zero exit code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Otherwise, globusrun will submit
the job to a GRAM service. By default, globusrun waits until
the job has terminated or failed before exiting, displaying
information about job <br>
state changes and at exit time, the job exit code if it is
provided by the GRAM service.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The globusrun program can also
function as a GASS file server to allow the
globus-job-manager program to stage files to and from the
machine on which globusrun is executed to the <br>
GRAM service node. This behavior is controlled by the -s,
-o, and -w command-line options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Jobs submitted by globusrun can
be monitored interactively or detached. To have globusrun
detach from the GRAM service after submitting the job, use
the -b or -F command-line <br>
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-help <br>
Display a help message to standard error and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-usage <br>
Display a one-line usage summary to standard error and
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-version <br>
Display the software version of globusrun to standard error
and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-versions <br>
Display the software version of all modules used by
globusrun (including DiRT information) to standard error and
then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, -parse <br>
Do a parse check on the job specification and print
diagnostics. If a parse error occurs, globusrun exits with a
non-zero exit code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f FILENAME, -file FILENAME <br>
Read job specification from the file named by FILENAME</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, -no-interrupt <br>
Disable handling of the SIGINT signal, so that the interrupt
character (typically Control-C causes globusrun to terminate
without canceling the job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r RESOURCE <br>
Submit the request to the resource specified by RESOURCE. A
resource may be specified in the following ways:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; HOST</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; HOST:PORT</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
HOST:PORT/SERVICE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; HOST/SERVICE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
HOST:/SERVICE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
HOST::SUBJECT</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
HOST:PORT:SUBJECT</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
HOST/SERVICE:SUBJECT</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
HOST:/SERVICE:SUBJECT</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
HOST:PORT/SERVICE:SUBJECT If any of PORT, SERVICE, or
SUBJECT is omitted, the defaults of 2811, jobmanager, and
host@HOST are used respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-j, -jobmanager-version <br>
Print the software version being run by the service running
at RESOURCE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k JOBID, -kill JOBID <br>
Kill the job named by JOBID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D, -full-proxy <br>
Delegate a full impersonation proxy to the service. By
default, a limited proxy is delegated when needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-y, -refresh-proxy: Delegate a
new proxy to the service processing JOBID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-status <br>
Display the current status of the job named by JOBID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q, -quiet <br>
Do not display job state change or exit code
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o, -output-enable <br>
Start a GASS server within the globusrun application that
allows access to its standard output and standard error
streams only. Also, augment the RSL with a definition of the
<br>
GLOBUSRUN_GASS_URL RSL substitution and add stdout and
stderr clauses which redirect the output and error streams
of the job to the output and error streams of the <br>
interactive globusrun command. If this is specified, then
globusrun acts as though the -q were also specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, -server <br>
Start a GASS server within the globusrun application that
allows access to its standard output and standard error
streams for writing and any file local the the globusrun
<br>
invocation for reading. Also, augment the RSL with a
definition of the GLOBUSRUN_GASS_URL RSL substitution and
add stdout and stderr clauses which redirect the output and
<br>
error streams of the job to the output and error streams of
the interactive globusrun command. If this is specified,
then globusrun acts as though the -q were also
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w, -write-allow <br>
Start a GASS server within the globusrun application that
allows access to its standard output and standard error
streams for writing and any file local the the globusrun
<br>
invocation for reading or writing. Also, augment the RSL
with a definition of the GLOBUSRUN_GASS_URL RSL substitution
and add stdout and stderr clauses which redirect the <br>
output and error streams of the job to the output and error
streams of the interactive globusrun command. If this is
specified, then globusrun acts as though the -q were also
<br>
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b, -batch <br>
Terminate after submitting the job to the GRAM service. The
GASS-related options can be used to stage input files, but
standard output, standard error, and file staging after <br>
the job completes will not be processed. The globusrun
program will exit after the job hits any of the following
states:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; PENDING</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; ACTIVE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; FAILED</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; DONE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F, -fast-batch <br>
Terminate after submitting the job to the GRAM service. The
globusrun program will exit after it receives a reply from
the service. The JOBID will be displayed to standard <br>
output before terminating so that the job can be checked
with the -status command-line option or modified by the
-refresh-proxy or -kill command-line options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, -dryrun <br>
Submit the job with the dryrun attribute set to true. When
this is done, the job manager will prepare to start the job
but start short of submitting it to the service. This <br>
can be used to detect problems with the RSL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
The following variables affect the execution of
globusrun</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">X509_USER_PROXY <br>
Path to proxy credential.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">X509_CERT_DIR <br>
Path to trusted certificate directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
The globusrun program assumes any failure to contact the job
means the job has terminated. In fact, this may be due to
the globus-job-manager program exiting after all jobs it is
<br>
managing have reached the DONE or FAILED states. In order to
reliably detect job termination, the two_phase RSL attribute
should be used.</p>
