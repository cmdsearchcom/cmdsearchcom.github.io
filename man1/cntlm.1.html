<p>CNTLM(1) Accelerating NTLM/NTLMv2 Authentication Proxy
CNTLM(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
cntlm - authenticating HTTP(S) proxy with TCP/IP tunneling
and acceleration</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
cntlm [ -AaBcDdFfgHhILlMPprSsTUuvw ] [ host1 port1 |
host1:port1 ] ... hostN portN</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Cntlm is an NTLM/NTLM SR/NTLMv2 authenticating HTTP proxy.
It stands between your applications and the corporate proxy,
adding NTLM authentication on-the-fly. You can specify <br>
several &quot;parent&quot; proxies and Cntlm will try one
after another until one works. All auth&rsquo;d connections
are cached and reused to achieve high efficiency. Just point
your apps proxy <br>
settings at Cntlm, fill in cntlm.conf (cntlm.ini) and
you&rsquo;re ready to do. This is useful on Windows, but
essential for non-Microsoft OS&rsquo;s. Proxy IP addresses
can be specified via <br>
CLI (host1:port1 to hostN:portN) or the configuration
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another option is to have cntlm
authenticate your local web connections without any parent
proxies. It can work in a stand-alone mode, just like Squid
or ISA. By default, all <br>
requests are forwarded to parent proxies, but the user can
set a &quot;NoProxy&quot; list, a list of URL matching
wild-card patterns, that route between direct and forward
modes. Cntlm can <br>
also recognize when all your corporate proxies are
unavailable and switch to stand-alone mode automatically
(and then back again). Aside from WWW and PROXY
authentication, cntlm <br>
provides a useful feature enabling users migrate their
laptops between work and home without changing proxy
settings in their applications (using cntlm all the time).
Cntlm also <br>
integrates transparent TCP/IP port forwarding (tunneling).
Each tunnel opens a new listening socket on local machine
and and forwards all connections to the target host behind
<br>
the parent proxy. Instead of these SSH-like tunnels, user
can also choose a limited SOCKS5 interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Core cntlm function had been
similar to the late NTLMAPS, but today, cntlm has evolved
way beyond anything any other application of this type can
offer. The feature list below <br>
speaks for itself. Cntlm has many security/privacy features
like NTLMv2 support and password protection - it is possible
to substitute password hashes (which can be obtained <br>
using -H) in place of the actual password or to enter the
password interactively (on start-up or via &quot;basic&quot;
HTTP auth translation). If plaintext password is used, it is
automat&acirc; <br>
ically hashed during the startup and all traces of it are
removed from the process memory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition to minimal use of
system resources, cntlm achieves higher throughput on a
given link. By caching authenticated connections, it acts as
an HTTP accelerator; This way, <br>
the 5-way auth handshake for each connection is
transparently eliminated, providing immediate access most of
the time. Cntlm never caches a request/reply body in memory,
in fact, <br>
no traffic is generated except for the exchange of auth
headers until the client &lt;-&gt; server connection is
fully negotiated. Only then real data transfer takes place.
Cntlm is <br>
written in optimized C and easily achieves fifteen times
faster responses than others.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An example of cntlm compared to
NTLMAPS: cntlm gave avg 76 kB/s with peak CPU usage of 0.3%
whereas with NTLMAPS it was avg 48 kB/s with peak CPU at 98%
(Pentium M 1.8 GHz). The <br>
extreme difference in resource usage is one of many
important benefits for laptop use. Peak memory consumption
(several complex sites, 50 paralell connections/threads;
values are <br>
in KiB):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VSZ RSS CMD <br>
3204 1436 ./cntlm -f -c ./cntlm.conf -P pid <br>
411604 6264 /usr/share/ntlmaps/main.py -c
/etc/ntlmaps/server.cfg</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Inherent part of the development
is profiling and memory management screening using Valgrind.
The source distribution contains a file called valgrind.txt,
where you can see the <br>
report confirming zero leaks, no access to unallocated
memory, no usage of uninitialized data - all traced down to
each instruction emulated in Valgrind&rsquo;s virtual CPU
during a <br>
typical production lifetime of the proxy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Most options can be pre-set in a configuration file.
Specifying an option more than once is not an error, but
cntlm ignores all occurences except the last one. This does
not <br>
apply to options like -L, each of which creates a new
instance of some feature. Cntlm can be built with a
hardcoded configuration file (e.g. /etc/cntlm.conf), which
is always <br>
loaded, if possible. See -c option on how to override some
or all of its settings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use -h to see available options
with short description.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A IP/mask (Allow) <br>
Allow ACL rule. Together with -D (Deny) they are the two
rules allowed in ACL policy. It is more usual to have this
in a configuration file, but Cntlm follows the premise <br>
that you can do the same on the command-line as you can
using the config file. When Cntlm receives a connection
request, it decides whether to allow or deny it. All ACL
<br>
rules are stored in a list in the same order as specified.
Cntlm then walks the list and the first IP/mask rule that
matches the request source address is applied. The <br>
mask can be any number from 0 to 32, where 32 is the default
(that is exact IP match). This notation is also known as
CIDR. If you want to match everything, use 0/0 or an <br>
asterix. ACLs on the command-line take precedence over those
in the config file. In such case, you will see info about
that in the log (among the list of unused options). <br>
There you can also see warnings about possibly incorrect
subnet spec, that&rsquo;s when the IP part has more bits
than you declare by mask (e.g. 10.20.30.40/24 should be <br>
10.20.30.0/24).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a NTLMv2 | NTLM2SR | NT | NTLM
| LM (Auth) <br>
Authentication type. NTLM(v2) comprises of one or two hashed
responses, NT and LM or NTLM2SR or NTv2 and LMv2, which are
computed from the password hash. Each response <br>
uses a different hashing algorithm; as new response types
were invented, stronger algorithms were used. When you first
install cntlm, find the strongest one which works <br>
for you (preferably using -M). Above they are listed from
strongest to weakest. Very old servers or dedicated HW
proxies might be unable to process anything but LM. If <br>
none of those work, see compatibility flags option -F or
submit a Support Request.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IMPORTANT: Although NTLMv2 is
not widely adopted (i.e. enforced), it is supported on all
Windows since NT 4.0 SP4. That&rsquo;s for a very long time!
I strongly suggest you use <br>
it to protect your credentials on-line. You should also
replace plaintext Password options with hashed
Pass[NTLMv2|NT|LM] equivalents. NTLMv2 is the most and
possibly the <br>
only secure authentication of the NTLM family.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B (NTLMToBasic) <br>
This option enables &quot;NTLM-to-basic&quot;, which allows
you to use one cntlm for multiple users. Please note that
all security of NTLM is lost this way. Basic auth uses just
a <br>
simple encoding algorithm to &quot;hide&quot; your
credentials and it is moderately easy to sniff them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IMPORTANT: HTTP protocol
obviously has means to negotiate authorization before
letting you through, but TCP/IP doesn&rsquo;t (i.e. open
port is open port). If you use NTLM-to- <br>
basic and DON&rsquo;T specify some username/password in the
configuration file, you are bound to loose tunneling
features, because cntlm alone won&rsquo;t know your
credentials.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Because NTLM identification has
at least three parts (username, password, domain) and the
basic authentication provides fields for only two (username,
password), you have <br>
to smuggle the domain part somewhere. You can set the Domain
config/cmd-line parameter, which will then be used for all
users, who don&rsquo;t specify their domain as a part of
<br>
the username. To do that and override the global domain
setting, use this instead of plain username in the password
dialog: &quot;domainsername&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c &lt;filename&gt; <br>
Configuration file. Command-line options, if used, override
its single options or are added at the top of the list for
multi options (tunnels, parent proxies, etc) with <br>
the exception of ACLs, which are completely overridden. Use
/dev/null to disable any config file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D IP/mask (Deny) <br>
Deny ACL rule. See option -A above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d &lt;domain&gt; (Domain) <br>
The domain or workgroup of the proxy account. This value can
also be specified as a part of the username with -u.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F &lt;flags&gt; (Flags) <br>
NTLM authentication flags. This option is rater delicate and
I do not recommend to change the default built-in values
unless you had no success with parent proxy auth and <br>
tried magic autodetection (-M) and all possible values for
the Auth option (-a). Remember that each NT/LM hash
combination requires different flags. This option is sort of
<br>
a complete &quot;manual override&quot; and you&rsquo;ll have
to deal with it yourself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Run in console as a
foreground job, do not fork into background. In this mode,
all syslog messages will be echoed to the console (on
platforms which support syslog <br>
LOG_PERROR option). Though cntlm is primarily designed as a
classic UNIX daemon with syslogd logging, it provides
detailed verbose mode without detaching from the
control&acirc; <br>
ling terminal; see -v. In any case, all error and diagnostic
messages are always sent to the system logger.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-G &lt;pattern&gt;
(ISAScannerAgent) <br>
User-Agent matching (case insensitive) for trans-isa-scan
plugin (see -S for explanation). Positive match identifies
requests (applications) for which the plugin should be <br>
enabled without considering the size of the download (see
-S). You can use shell wildcard characters, namely
&quot;*&quot;, &quot;?&quot; and &quot;[]&quot;. If used
without -S or ISAScannerSize, the <br>
max_size_in_kb is internally set to infinity, so the plugin
will be active ONLY for selected User-Agents, regardless of
download size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g (Gateway) <br>
Gateway mode, cntlm listens on all network interfaces.
Default is to bind just loopback. That way, only local
processes can connect to cntlm. In the gateway mode though,
<br>
cntlm listens on all interfaces and is accessible to other
machines on the network. Please note that with this option
the command-line order matters when specifying proxy <br>
or tunnel local (listening) ports. Those positioned before
it will bind only loopback; those after will be public. <br>
IMPORTANT: All of the above applies only to local ports for
which you didn&rsquo;t specify any source address. If you
did, cntlm tries to bind the given port only on the
speci&acirc; <br>
fied interface (or rather IP address).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H Use this option to get hashes
for password-less configuration. In this mode, cntlm prints
the results and exits. You can just copy &amp; paste right
into the config file. You <br>
ought to use this option with explicit -u and -d, because
some hashes include the username and domain name in the
calculation. Do see -a for security recommendations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Display help (available
options with a short description) and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I Interactive password prompt.
Any password settings from the command line or config file
is ignored and a password prompt is issued. Use this option
only from shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L
[&lt;saddr&gt;:]&lt;lport&gt;:&lt;rhost&gt;:&lt;rport&gt;
(Tunnel) <br>
Tunnel definition. The syntax is the same as in
OpenSSH&rsquo;s local forwarding (-L), with a new optional
prefix, saddr - the source IP address to bind the lport to.
Cntlm will <br>
listen for incoming connections on the local port lport,
forwarding every new connection through the parent proxy to
the rhost:rport (authenticating on the go). This <br>
option can be used multiple times for unlimited number of
tunnels, with or without the saddr option. See -g for the
details concerning local port binding when saddr is not <br>
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please note that many corporate
proxies do not allow connections to ports other than 443
(https), but if you run your target service on this port,
you should be safe. Con&acirc; <br>
nect to HTTPS is &quot;always&quot; allowed, otherwise
nobody would be able to browse https:// sites. In any case,
first try if you can establish a connection through the
tunnel, <br>
before you rely on it. This feature does the same job as
tools like corkscrew(1), but instead of communicating over a
terminal, cntlm keeps it TCP/IP.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l [&lt;saddr&gt;:]&lt;lport&gt;
(Listen) <br>
Local port for the cntlm proxy service. Use the number you
have chosen here and the hostname of the machine running
cntlm (possibly localhost) as proxy settings in your <br>
browser and/or the environment. Most applications (including
console) support the notion of proxy to connect to other
hosts. On POSIX, set the following variables to use <br>
e.g. wget(1) without any trouble (fill in the actual address
of cntlm):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ export
ftp_proxy=http://localhost:3128 <br>
$ export http_proxy=$ftp_proxy <br>
$ export https_proxy=$ftp_proxy</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can choose to run the proxy
service on more than one port, in such case just use this
option as many times as necessary. But unlike tunnel
definition, cntlm fails to <br>
start if it cannot bind all of the proxy service ports.
Proxy service port can also be bound selectively. Use saddr
to pick source IP address to bind the lport to. This <br>
allows you, for example, to run the service on different
ports for subnet A and B and make it invisible for subnet C.
See -g for the details concerning local port binding <br>
when saddr is not used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M &lt;testurl&gt; <br>
Run magic NTLM dialect detection. In this mode, cntlm tries
some known working presets against your proxy. Probe
requests are made for the specified testurl, with the <br>
strongest hashes going first. When finished, settings for
the most secure setup are printed. Although the detection
will tell you which and how to use Auth, Flags and <br>
password-hash options, you have to configure at least your
credentials and proxy address first. You can use -I to enter
your password interactively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N
&lt;pattern1&gt;[,&lt;patternN] (NoProxy) <br>
Avoid parent proxy for these host names. All matching
URL&rsquo;s will be proxied directly by cntlm as a
stand-alone proxy. Cntlm supports WWW authentication in this
mode, thus <br>
allowing you to access local intranet sites with corporate
NTLM authentication. Hopefully, you won&rsquo;t need that
virtualized MSIE any more. :)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O
[&lt;saddr&gt;:]&lt;port_number&gt; (SOCKS5Proxy) <br>
Enable SOCKS5 proxy and make it listen on local port
port_number (source IP spec is also possible, as with all
options). By default, there will be no restrictions as to
<br>
who can use this service. Some clients don&rsquo;t even
support SOCKS5 authentication (e.g. almost all browsers). If
you wish to enforce authentication, use -R or its equivalent
<br>
option, SOCKS5User. As with port tunneling, it is up to the
parent proxy whether it will allow connection to any
requested host:port. This feature can be used with <br>
tsocks(1) to make most TCP/IP applications go thru the proxy
rather than directly (only outgoing connections will work,
obviously). To make apps work without DNS server, <br>
it is important that they don&rsquo;t resolve themselves,
but using SOCKS. E.g. Firefox has this option available
through URI &quot;about:config&quot;, key name net&acirc;
<br>
work.proxy.socks_remote_dns, which must be set to true.
Proxy-unaware tsocksified apps, will have to be configured
using IP addresses to prevent them from DNS resolving.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P &lt;pidfile&gt; <br>
Create a PID file pidfile upon startup. If the specified
file exists, it is truncated and overwritten. This option is
intended for use with start-stop-daemon(8) and other <br>
servicing mechanisms. Please note that the PID file is
created AFTER the process drops its privileges and forks.
When the daemon finishes cleanly, the file is removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p &lt;password&gt; (Password,
PassNT, ...) <br>
Proxy account password. Cntlm deletes the password from the
memory, to make it invisible in /proc or with inspection
tools like ps(1), but the preferable way of setting <br>
password is the configuration file. To that end, you can use
Password option (for plaintext, human readable format), or
&quot;encrypt&quot; your password via -H and then use
Pass&acirc; <br>
NTLMv2, PassNT and/or PassLM.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R
&lt;username&gt;:&lt;password&gt; (SOCKS5User) <br>
If SOCKS5 proxy is enabled, this option can make it
accessible only to those who have been authorized. It can be
used several times, to create a whole list of accounts <br>
(allowed user:pass combinations).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S &lt;max_size_in_kb&gt;
(ISAScannerSize) <br>
Enables the plugin for transparent handling of the dreaded
ISA AV scanner, which returns an interactive HTTP page
(displaying the scanning progress) instead of the <br>
file/data you&rsquo;ve requested, every time it feels like
scanning the contents. This presumptuous behavior breaks
every automated downloader, updater and basically EVERY <br>
application relying on downloads (e.g. wget, apt-get).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The parameter max_size_in_kb
allows you to choose maximum download size you wish to
handle by the plugin (see below why you might want that). If
the file size is bigger <br>
than this, cntlm forwards you the interactive page,
effectively disabling the plugin for that download. Zero
means no limit. Use -G/ISAScannerAgent to identify
applica&acirc; <br>
tions for which max_size_in_kb should be ignored (forcing
the plugin). It works by matching User-Agent header and is
necessary for e.g. wget, apt-get and yum, which would <br>
fail if the response is some HTTP page instead of requested
data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">How it works: the client asks
for a file, cntlm detects ISA&rsquo;s bullshit response and
waits for the secret link to ISA&rsquo;s cache, which comes
no sooner than the file is down&acirc; <br>
loaded and scanned by ISA. Only then can cntlm make the
second request for the real file and forward it along with
correct headers to the client. The client doesn&rsquo;t
time&acirc; <br>
out while waiting for it, b/c cntlm is periodically sending
an extra &quot;keepalive&quot; header, but the user might
get nervous not seeing the progress bar move. It&rsquo;s of
course <br>
purely psychological matter, there&rsquo;s no difference if
cntlm or your browser requests the scanned file - you must
wait for ISA to do it&rsquo;s job and download then. You
just <br>
expect to see some progress indicator move, which is all
what the ISA&rsquo;s page does: it shows HTML countdown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the plugin cannot parse the
interactive page for some reason (unknown formatting, etc.),
it quits and the page is forwarded to you - it&rsquo;s never
&quot;lost&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The keepalive header is called
ISA-Scanner and shows ISA&rsquo;s progress, e.g.:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HTTP/1.1 200 OK <br>
ISA-Scanner: 1000 of 10000 <br>
ISA-Scanner: 2000 of 10000 <br>
...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r &quot;&lt;name&gt;:
&lt;value&gt;&quot; (Header) <br>
Header substitution. Every client&rsquo;s request will be
processed and any headers defined using -r or in the
configuration file will be added to it. In case the header
is <br>
already present, its value will be replaced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Serializes all requests by
not using concurrent threads for proxy (tunneling still
works in parallel). This has a horrible impact on
performance and is available only for <br>
debugging purposes. When used with -v, it yields nice
sequential debug log, where requests take turns.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T &lt;filename&gt; <br>
Used in combination with -v to save the debug output into a
trace file. It should be placed as the first parameter on
the command line. To prevent data loss, it never <br>
overwrites an existing file. You have to pick a unique name
or manually delete the old file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U &lt;uid&gt; <br>
When executed as root, do the stuff that needs such
permissions (read config, bind ports, etc.) and then
immediately drop privileges and change to uid. This
parameter can <br>
be either number or system username. If you use a number,
both uid and gid of the process will be set to this value;
if you specify a username, uid and gid will be set <br>
according to that user&rsquo;s uid and primary gid as
defined in /etc/passwd. You should use the latter, possibly
using a dedicated cntlm account. As with any daemon, you are
<br>
strongly advised to run cntlm under a non-privileged
account.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u &lt;user&gt;[@&lt;domain&gt;]
(Username) <br>
Proxy account/user name. Domain can be be entered as
well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Print debugging information.
Automatically enables (-f).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w &lt;workstation&gt;
(Workstation) <br>
Workstation NetBIOS name. Do not use full qualified domain
name (FQDN) here. Just the first part. If not specified,
cntlm tries to get the system hostname and if that <br>
fails, uses &quot;cntlm&quot; - it&rsquo;s because some
proxies require this field non-empty.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION <br>
Configuration file is basically an INI file, except there
are no &quot;=&quot; between keys and values. It comprises
of whitespace delimited keyword and value pairs. Apart from
that, there <br>
are sections as well, they have the usual
&quot;[section_name]&quot; syntax. Comment begins with a
hash &quot;#&quot; or a semicolon &quot;;&quot; and can be
anywhere in the file. Everything after the mark <br>
up until EOL is a comment. Values can contain any
characters, including whitespace. You can use double quotes
around the value to set a string containing special
characters like <br>
spaces, pound signs, etc. No escape sequences are allowed in
quoted strings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are two types of keywords,
local and global. Local options specify authentication
details per domain (or location). Global keywords apply to
all sections and proxies. They <br>
should be placed before all sections, but it&rsquo;s not
necessary. They are: Allow, Deny, Gateway, Listen,
SOCKS5Proxy, SOCKS5User, NTLMToBasic, Tunnel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All available keywords are
listed here, full descriptions are in the OPTIONS
section:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Allow &lt;IP&gt;[/&lt;mask&gt;]
<br>
ACL allow rule, see -A.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Auth NTLMv2 | NTLM2SR | NT |
NTLM | LM <br>
Select any possible combination of NTLM hashes using a
single parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Deny &lt;IP&gt;[/&lt;mask&gt;]
<br>
ACL deny rule, see -A.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Domain &lt;domain_name&gt; <br>
Proxy account domain/workgroup name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Flags &lt;flags&gt; <br>
NTLM authentication flags. See -F for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Gateway yes|no <br>
Gateway mode. In the configuration file, order doesn&rsquo;t
matter. Gateway mode applies the same to all tunnels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Header &lt;headername: value&gt;
<br>
Header substitution. See -r for details and remember, no
quoting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ISAScannerAgent &lt;pattern&gt;
<br>
Wildcard-enabled (*, ?, []) case insensitive User-Agent
string matching for the trans-isa-plugin. If you don&rsquo;t
define ISAScannerSize, it is internally set to infinity,
<br>
i.e. disabling the plugin for all downloads except those
agent-matched ones. See -G.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ISAScannerSize
&lt;max_size_in_kb&gt; <br>
Enable trans-isa-scan plugin. See -S for more.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Listen
[&lt;saddr&gt;:]&lt;port_number&gt; <br>
Local port number for the cntlm&rsquo;s proxy service. See
-l for more.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Password &lt;password&gt; <br>
Proxy account password. As with any other option, the value
(password) can be enclosed in double quotes (&quot;) in case
it contains special characters like spaces, pound <br>
signs, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PassNTLMv2, PassNT, PassLM
&lt;password&gt; <br>
Hashes of the proxy account password (see -H and -a). When
you want to use hashes in the config (instead of plaintext
password), each Auth settings requires different <br>
options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Settings | Requires <br>
-------------+----------------- <br>
Auth NTLMv2 | PassNTLMv2 <br>
Auth NTLM2SR | PassNT <br>
Auth NT | PassNT <br>
Auth NTLM | PassNT + PassLM <br>
Auth LM | PassLM</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Proxy &lt;host:port&gt; <br>
Parent proxy, which requires authentication. The same as
proxy on the command-line, can be used more than once to
specify an arbitrary number of proxies. Should one proxy
<br>
fail, cntlm automatically moves on to the next one. The
connect request fails only if the whole list of proxies is
scanned and (for each request) and found to be invalid. <br>
Command-line takes precedence over the configuration
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NoProxy &lt;pattern1&gt;,
&lt;pattern2&gt;, ... <br>
Avoid parent proxy for these host names. All matching
URL&rsquo;s will be proxied directly by cntlm as a
stand-alone proxy. Cntlm supports WWW authentication in this
mode, thus <br>
allowing you to access local intranet sites with corporate
NTLM authentication. Hopefully, you won&rsquo;t need that
virtualized MSIE any more. :) See -N for more.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SOCKS5Proxy
[&lt;saddr&gt;:]&lt;lport&gt; <br>
Enable SOCKS5 proxy. See -O for more.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SOCKS5User
&lt;username&gt;:&lt;password&gt; <br>
Create a new SOCKS5 proxy account. See -R for more.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NTLMToBasic yes|no <br>
Enable/disable NTLM-to-basic authenticatoin. See -B for
more.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tunnel
[&lt;saddr&gt;:]&lt;lport&gt;:&lt;rhost&gt;:&lt;rport&gt;
<br>
Tunnel definition. See -L for more.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Username <br>
Proxy account name, without the possibility to include
domain name (&rsquo;at&rsquo; sign is interpreted
literally).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Workstation &lt;hostname&gt;
<br>
The hostname of your workstation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
The optional location of the configuration file is defined
in the Makefile, with the default for 1) deb/rpm package, 2)
traditional &quot;make; make install&quot; and 3) Windows
installer, <br>
respectively, being:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1) /etc/cntlm.conf <br>
2) /usr/local/etc/cntlm.conf <br>
3) %PROGRAMFILES%ntlm.ini</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PORTING <br>
Cntlm is being used on many platforms, little and big endian
machines, so users should not have any problems with
compilation. Nowadays, cntlm is a standard tool in most
Linux <br>
distributions and there are various repositories for other
UNIX-like systems. Personally, I release Debian Linux (deb),
RedHat Linux (rpm) and Windows (exe) binaries, but most <br>
people get cntlm from their OS distributor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For compilation details, see
README in the source distribution. Porting to any POSIX
conforming OS shouldn&rsquo;t be more than a matter of a
Makefile rearrangement. Cntlm uses <br>
strictly POSIX.1-2001 interfaces with ISO C99 libc and is
also compliant with SUSv3. Since version 0.33, cntlm
supports Windows using a POSIX emulation layer called
Cygwin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
To report a bug, enable the debug output, save it to a file
and submit on-line along with a detailed description of the
problem and how to reproduce it. Visit the home page for
<br>
more.</p>
