<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
beancounter gathers and analyses stock market data to
evaluate portfolio performance. It has several modes of
operation. The first main mode is data gathering: both
current data <br>
(e.g. end-of-day closing prices) and historical price data
(to back-populate the database) can be retrieved both
automatically and efficiently with subsequent local storage
in a <br>
relational database system (either PostgreSQL, MySQL or
SQLite) though any other system with an ODBC driver could be
used). The second main mode is data analysis where the
stored <br>
data is evaluated to provide performance information.
Several canned reports types are already available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Data is retrieved very
efficiently in a single batch query per Yahoo! host from the
Yahoo! Finance web sites using Finance::YahooQuote module
(where version 0.18 or newer is <br>
required for proxy support). Support exists for North
America (i.e. US and Canada), Europe (i.e. the Continent as
well as Great Britain), several Asian stock markets,
Australia <br>
and New Zealand.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">beancounter can aggregate the
change in value for the entire portfolio over arbitrary time
horizons (provided historical data has either been gathered
or has been backpopulated). <br>
Using the powerful date-parsing routine available to Perl
(thanks to the Date::Manip modules), you can simply say
&rsquo;from six months ago to today&rsquo; (see below for
examples).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">beancounter has been written and
tested under Linux. It should run under any standard Unix as
long as the required Perl modules are installed, as as long
as the database backend <br>
is found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
beancounter update --forceupdate today</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This updates the database: it
extends timeseries data (such as <br>
open, low, high, close, volume) with data for the current
day, <br>
and overwrites static data (such as capital, price/earnings,
...) <br>
with current data. All stocks held in the database are
updated <br>
(unless the --restriction argument instructs otherwise). The
<br>
--forceupdate option lets the program corrects incorrect
dates <br>
returned from Yahoo! (which happens every now and so often),
but <br>
be careful to correct for this on public holidays. Note that
<br>
the --restriction argument will be applied to the portfolio
table, <br>
whereas the overall selection comes from the stockinfo
table.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">beancounter addportfolio
IBM:100:USD:401k:joe:90.25:20000320
SPY:50:USD:ira:joe:142.25:20000620</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This adds IBM to the 401k
portfolio of Joe, as well as SP500 <br>
&rsquo;Spiders&rsquo; to his IRA portfolio. The stocks are
also added to the <br>
general stock info tables via an implicit call of the
stockinfo <br>
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">beancounter addstock LNUX RHAT
COR.TO</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This adds these three Linux
companies to the database without adding <br>
them to any specific portfolios.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">beancounter backpopulate
--prevdate &rsquo;1 year ago&rsquo; --date &rsquo;friday 1
week ago&rsquo; IBM MSFT HWP</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This backpopulates the database
with historic prices for three <br>
hardware companies. Note how the date specification is very
general <br>
thanks to the underlying Date::Manip module.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">beancounter fxbackpopulate
--prevdate &rsquo;1 year ago&rsquo; --date &rsquo;friday 1
week ago&rsquo; CAD EUR GBP</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This backpopulates the database
with historic prices for these <br>
three currencies. Note how the date specification is very
general <br>
thanks to the underlying Date::Manip module.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unfortunately, Yahoo! is a
little bone-headed in its implementation <br>
of historic FX rates -- these are stored to only two
decimals <br>
precision, just like stockprices. Unfortunately, convention
is to <br>
use at least four if not six. Because of the limited
information, <br>
risk from FX changes will be underestimated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">beancounter plreport --prevdate
&rsquo;1 month ago&rsquo; --date &rsquo;today&rsquo;
--restriction &quot;owner=&rsquo;joe&rsquo;&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This calculates portfolio
profits or losses over the last month. It <br>
also imposes the database restriction that only stocks owned
by <br>
&rsquo;joe&rsquo; are to be included.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">beancounter status --restriction
&quot;type=&rsquo;401k&rsquo;&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This shows a portfolio status
report with the restriction that only <br>
stocks from the &rsquo;401k&rsquo; account are to be
included.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">beancounter risk --prevdate
&quot;6 month ago&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This shows a portfolio risk
report. This tries describes the <br>
statistically plausible loss which should be exceeded only 1

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Run a complete
&rsquo;job&rsquo;: update the database, show a day-end
profit/loss <br>
report, show a portfolio status report and show a
riskreport. In the <br>
update mode, override a potentially wrong date supplied by
Yahoo! <br>
with the current date.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">beancounter split --splitby 3
--prevdate 1990-01-01 ABC CDE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Split-adjusts the (hypothetical)
stocks ABC and CDE by a factor <br>
of three: price data in the database is divided by three,
volume <br>
increased by 3 and similarly, in the portfolio shares are
increased <br>
and cost is descreased. Default dates are --prevdate and
--date <br>
which may need adjusting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TUTORIAL <br>
The following few paragraphs will illustrate the use of
beancounter. We will set up two fictional accounts for two
brothers Bob and Bill (so that we can illustrate the
&rsquo;owner&rsquo; <br>
column). The prices below are completely fictitious, as are
the portfolios.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">We suppose that beancounter is
installed and that the setup_beancounter command has been
run. We can then create a two-stock (computer hardware)
portfolio for Bob as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">beancounter addportfolio
SPY:50:USD:401k:bob:142.25:20000620
IBM:100:USD:401k:bob:90.25:20000320</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here we specify that 100 shares
each of SPY and IBM, priced in US Dollars, are in
Bob&rsquo;s portfolio which is tagged as a 401k retirement
account. The (fictitious) purchase price <br>
and date are also given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Let&rsquo;s suppose that Bill
prefers networking equipment, and that he has a brokerage
account in Canada:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">beancounter addportfolio
CSCO:100:USD:spec:bill:78.00:19990817
NT.TO:200:CAD:spec:bill:cad:90.25:20000212</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Now we can backpopulate the
database from 1998 onwards for all four stocks:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">beancounter backpopulate
--prevdate 19980101 CSCO IBM NT.TO SPY</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With this historical data in
place, we now compare how Bob&rsquo;s portfolio would have
fared over the last 18 months:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">beancounter plreport --prevdate
&rsquo;18 months ago&rsquo; --restriction
&quot;owner=&rsquo;bob&rsquo;&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note how we use double quotes to
protect the arguments, and how the SQL restriction contains
a further single quote around the literal string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">We can also review the
performance for Bill at the most recent trading day:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">beancounter dayendreport
--restriction &quot;owner=&rsquo;bill&rsquo;&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or the status of holdings and
their respective values:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">beancounter dayendreport
--restriction &quot;owner=&rsquo;bill&rsquo;&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Similarly, a risk reports can be
run on this portfolios per</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">beancounter risk --restriction
&quot;owner=&rsquo;bill&rsquo;&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MORE DETAILED COMMAND
DESCRIPTION <br>
addportfolio is the most important &rsquo;position
entry&rsquo; command. As with other commands, several
arguments can be given at the same time. For each of these,
records are separated <br>
using a colon and specify, in order, stock symbol, number of
stocks held, currency, account type, account owner, purchase
price and purchase date. Only the first three arguments <br>
are required, the others are optional. Executing
addportfolio implicitly executes addstock. The account type
column can be used to specify whether the account is, e.g.,
a tax- <br>
sheltered retirement account, or it could be used to denote
the brokerage company is it held at.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">plreport retrieves the most
recent quotes(s). This is useful for illiquid securities
which might not have traded that day, or if a public holiday
occurred, or if there was a data <br>
error at Yahoo!. Two dates can be specified which determine
the period over which the profit or loss is computed. This
will fail if price data (or currency data in the case of
<br>
foreign stocks data) data is not available for either of
those two dates. This may be restrictive for foreign stocks
where we cannot backpopulate due to lack of public data <br>
source for historical currency quotes. Major currencies can
be retrieved from Yahoo!, but only to two decimals
precisions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dayendreport is similar to
plreport but is always over a one-day period. It also uses
only one date record by calculating performance given the
&rsquo;previous close&rsquo; data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">status shows holdings amounts,
total position values, annualized returns in percentages and
holding periods in days. Note that the annualized returns
can appear excessive if, <br>
e.g., a ten-day return from a recently purchased stock is
extrapolated to an annual time period.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">risk shows a portfolio risk
report which describes the statistically plausible loss
which should be exceeded only 1 out of 100 times. In other
words, the loss estimate has a <br>
critical level of 99%. This risk level is estimated via two
methods. The first is non-parametric and assumes no
particular model or distribution; it computes the 1%
quintile of <br>
the return distribution and displays it as well as the
corresponding asset value at risk. The second method uses
the standard Value-at-Risk (VaR) approach. This uses the 1%
<br>
critical value of the Normal distribution and implicitly
assumes a normal distribution for returns. See
&quot;http://www.gloriamundi.org&quot; for more introduction
and references. If the <br>
distribution of normalitty was perfectly true, both measures
would coincide. A large difference between the two estimates
would indicate that the return distribution might be <br>
rather non-normal. Another view of the riskiness of a given
position is provided by the last column with the
&rsquo;margVaR&rsquo; heading. It shows the marginal
Value-at-Risk. Marginal VaR <br>
is commonly defined as the risk contribution of the given
position to the total portfolio, and calculated as the
difference in the VaR of the full portfolio and the VaR of
an <br>
otherwise identical portfolio with the given position
removed. Note that calculating marginal VaR is fairly slow
(on the order of O(n^3) ].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">retracement shows a
&rsquo;drawdown&rsquo; report. Drawdown is commonly defined
as the percentage loss relative to the previous high. The
default period is used, but can be altered with the <br>
--date and --prevdate options. The default period is also
corrected for the actual holding period. In other words, if
a stock has been held for two months, only those two months
<br>
are used instead of the default of six months -- but if the
last months has been selected via --prevdate then it is
used. For short positions, the analysis is inverted and <br>
relative to the previous low. The report displays each
stock, the number of shares held, the current price and
holdings value. The next two columns show the maximum price
<br>
attained in the examined period, and the percent decline
relative to it. The last column shows the unrealized loss
relative to the maximum price over the period. The aggregate
<br>
holdings value, percent decline and unrealized loss are
shown as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">advancement does the opposite of
drawdown -- it computes unrealized gains relative to the
minimum price in the period. The discussion in the preceding
paragraph applies &lsquo;but <br>
inverted&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lsportfolio simply lists the
content of the portfolio table. A SQL restriction can be
imposed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">addindex adds stocks a the index
table. Currently, no further analysis references this
table.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">addstock adds stocks to the
database. From then on data will be retrieved for the given
symbol(s) and stored in the database whenever the update
command is executed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">backpopulate fills the database
with historic prices for the given symbols and date period.
Note that this works well for stocks and mutual fund.
Options have no historic data <br>
stored. Currencies are stored with limited precision as
noted above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">quote simply shows a price quote
for the given symbol(s).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">update updates the database with
quotes for all stocks for the given day. No output is
generated making the command suitable for cron
execution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dailyjob is a simple convenience
wrapper around update, dayendreport, status and risk,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">allreports is a another
covenience wrapper around dayendreport, status and risk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">deactivate will set the active
column in stockinfo for the given symbol(s) to false thereby
inhibiting any further updates of symbol(s). The existing
data for symbol(s) is <br>
retained. Use this when a stock is acquired, delisted, or
you simply want to stop tracking it -- but do not want to
purge the historical data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">split adjusts the price
database, and the portfolio holdings, for stock splits. The
default factor is 2, this can be adjusted with the option
--splitby. The dates arguments can <br>
be set with --prevdate and --date.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">delete removes the given symbols
from the database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">destroydb deletes the
BeanCounter database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">checkdbconnection simply opens
and closes the database handle, and returns a specified exit
code which can then be tested. This is used in the
setup_beancounter command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">warranty display a short GNU
General Public License statement.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MORE DETAILED OPTION DESCRIPTION
<br>
--currency can be used to select a different home currency.
Instead of having all values converted to the default
currency, the selected currency is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--date allows to choose a
different reference date. This is then be be used by
commands working on a date, or date period, such as
plreport, dayendreport, backpopulate, <br>
fxbackpopulate or status. --prevdate allows to choose a
different start date for return calculations, or data
gathering.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--restriction can be used to
restrict the database selection. The argument must be a
valid part of valid SQL statement in the sense that existing
columns and operators have to be <br>
employed. The argument to this option will be completed with
a leading and. The SQL restriction will typcally be over
elements of the portfolio table which comprises the columns
<br>
symbol, shares, currency, type, owner, cost and date. A
simple example would be currency=&rsquo;CAD&rsquo;. Note
that this has to protected by double quotes &quot;I on the
command-line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--extrafx allows to gather data
on additional currency rates beyond those automatically
selected as shares are listed in them. A typical example
would be for a European investor <br>
wanting to convert from the EUR in which the shares are
listed into one of the member currencies which beancounter
would no longer retrieve as shares are no longer listed in
<br>
these.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--forceupdate allows to
overwrite an potentially wrong date in the database update.
Unfortunately, it appears that Yahoo! occasionally reports
correct prices with an incorrect <br>
date such as the previous day&rsquo;s. In such a case, this
option, along with an argument such as &rsquo;today&rsquo;
can override the bad date datapoint and avoid a hole in the
database. The <br>
downside of this approach is that it would
&quot;double&quot; the previous data in the case of a public
holiday, or even if it was run the weekend. A somewhat
smarter comparison to <br>
previously stored data might prevent that, but would be more
complex to implement.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--rcfile allows to specify a
resource file different from the default
~/.beancounterrc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dbsystem allows to switch to a
different database backend. The default is PostgreSQL but
MySQL and SQLite are also supported. For SQLite, the default
is now version 3.* but the <br>
previous version -- which is not binarily compatible -- is
supported as well with argument &rsquo;SQLite2&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dbname allows to switch to an
alternate database. The default is
&rsquo;beancounter&rsquo;. This can be useful for testing
new features.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--fxupdate is a boolean switch
to enforece updates of FX rates during &rsquo;update&rsquo;.
The default is &rsquo;true&rsquo; but
&rsquo;--nofxupdate&rsquo; can be used to suppress the
update of foreign exchange <br>
rates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Similarly, --equityupdate is a
boolean switch to enforece, or suppress updates of Equity
(i.e. stock) data during &rsquo;update&rsquo;. The default
is &rsquo;true&rsquo; but &rsquo;--noequityupdate&rsquo; can
be <br>
used to suppress the update of foreign exchange rates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ubcfx is a boolean switch to
use the &rsquo;PACIFIC&rsquo; FX rate service from the
Sauder School at UBC. This is useful when the default FX
rate service at Yahoo! is erratic, or <br>
unreliable. While the PACIFIC server provides a wider
variety of exchange rates, Yahoo! can still be useful as it
can provide more columns (open/high/low). However, during
most <br>
of 2005, Yahoo! has been unrealiable for the exchange rates
and has not provided historical FX data. On the other hand,
the UBC service does not run on Canadian holidays so it <br>
cannot really server as a full substitute. Contributions for
a new data acquisition, maybe via www.oanda.com would be
welcome.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--splitby can be used to set a
stock split factor other than the default of 2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--host can be used to point to a
machine containing the PostgreSQL or MySQL database. The
machine can be remote, or it can be the actual machine
beancounter is running on. If a <br>
hostname is given, tcp/ip connection are used. If no
hostname is given, the default value of
&rsquo;localhost&rsquo; implies that local socket
connections are used which may be easier to <br>
employ for less experienced adatabase users.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also, --commit is a boolean
switch to suppress actual database updates if the negated
--nocommit is selected. This is useful mostly in debugging
contexts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The --verbose and --debug
switches can be used in debugging an testing, and --help
triggers the display of help message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYSTEM OVERVIEW <br>
The following section details some of the database and
configuration options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DATABASE REQUIREMENTS <br>
beancounter currently depends on either PostgreSQL, MySQL,
SQLite (version 2 or 3) or any other database for which an
ODBC driver is available (though the required tables would
<br>
have to created manually in the ODBC case). Yet another DB
backend could be added provided suitable Perl DBI drivers
are available. For PostgreSQL, MySQL and SQLite, the <br>
setup_beancounter script can create and initialize the
database, form the required tables and fills them with some
example data. It is a starting point for local
modifications.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The connection to the database
is made via a dedicated function in the BeanCounter.pm
module, changes would only have to be made there. As of this
writing the Perl DBI (the <br>
database-independent interface for Perl) is used along the
DBI drivers for PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite and ODBC. Ports
for Oracle, Sybase, ... are encouraged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIG FILE <br>
A configuration file ~/.beancounterrc is read if found. It
currently supports the following options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">currency to specify into which
home currency holdings and profits/losses have to be
converted <br>
host to specify the database server on which the BeanCounter
database resides (this is needed only for the alternate
connection via the DBI-Pg driver in case DBI-ODBC is not
<br>
used) <br>
user to specify the userid for the database connection; if
needed. If not specified, the current user id is used. <br>
passwd to specify the password for the database connection,
if needed. <br>
dbsystem to select a database backend, e.g. to switch from
PostgreSQL to MySQL or SQLite or SQLite2 (the previous
format of SQLite). <br>
dbname to select a different default database name other
than the default of &rsquo;beancounter&rsquo; <br>
proxy to specify the address of a firewall proxy server if
one is needed to connect to the Internet. <br>
firewall to specify a firewallid:firewallpasswd combination,
if needed. <br>
odbc is a switch to turn ODBC connection on or off <br>
dsn to use a different data source name when ODBC is used
<br>
An example file example.beancounterrc should have come with
the sources (or the Debian package); please consult this
file for more examples.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ODBC CONFIGURATION <br>
There are now several ODBC systems available for Linux /
Unix. The following ~/.odbc.ini work with the iODBC library
and the PostgreSQL ODBC driver on my Debian GNU/Linux
system:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[ODBC Data Sources] <br>
beancounter = BeanCounter Database</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[beancounter] <br>
Driver = /usr/lib/libpsqlodbc.so <br>
Database = beancounter <br>
Servername = localhost</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[ODBC] <br>
InstallDir = /usr/lib</p>
