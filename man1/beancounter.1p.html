<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>beancounter</b> gathers and analyses stock market data to evaluate portfolio
  performance. It has several modes of operation. The first main mode is data
  gathering: both current data (e.g. end-of-day closing prices) and historical
  price data (to back-populate the database) can be retrieved both automatically
  and efficiently with subsequent local storage in a relational database system
  (either <i>PostgreSQL</i>, <i>MySQL</i> or <i>SQLite</i>) though any other
  system with an <i>ODBC</i> driver could be used). The second main mode is data
  analysis where the stored data is evaluated to provide performance
  information. Several canned reports types are already available.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Data is retrieved very efficiently in a single batch query per Yahoo! host from
  the Yahoo! Finance web sites using Finance::YahooQuote module (where version
  0.18 or newer is required for proxy support). Support exists for North America
  (i.e. US and Canada), Europe (i.e. the Continent as well as Great Britain),
  several Asian stock markets, Australia and New Zealand.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>beancounter</b> can aggregate the change in value for the entire portfolio
  over arbitrary time horizons (provided historical data has either been
  gathered or has been backpopulated). Using the powerful date-parsing routine
  available to Perl (thanks to the <i>Date::Manip</i> modules), you can simply
  say 'from six months ago to today' (see below for examples).
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>beancounter</b> has been written and tested under Linux. It should run under
  any standard Unix as long as the required Perl modules are installed, as as
  long as the database backend is found.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="EXAMPLES"><a class="selflink" href="#EXAMPLES">EXAMPLES</a></h1>
<pre>
 beancounter update --forceupdate today
    This updates the database: it extends timeseries data (such as
    open, low, high, close, volume) with data for the current day,
    and overwrites static data (such as capital, price/earnings, ...) 
    with current data. All stocks held in the database are updated
    (unless the --restriction argument instructs otherwise). The 
    --forceupdate option lets the program corrects incorrect dates 
    returned from Yahoo! (which happens every now and so often), but
    be careful to correct for this on public holidays. Note that 
    the --restriction argument will be applied to the portfolio table,
    whereas the overall selection comes from the stockinfo table.
 beancounter addportfolio IBM:100:USD:401k:joe:90.25:20000320  \
                          SPY:50:USD:ira:joe:142.25:20000620
    This adds IBM to the 401k portfolio of Joe, as well as SP500
    'Spiders' to his IRA portfolio. The stocks are also added to the
    general stock info tables via an implicit call of the stockinfo
    command.
 beancounter addstock LNUX RHAT COR.TO
    This adds these three Linux companies to the database without adding
    them to any specific portfolios.
 beancounter backpopulate --prevdate '1 year ago' \
                          --date 'friday 1 week ago' IBM MSFT HWP
    This backpopulates the database with historic prices for three
    hardware companies. Note how the date specification is very general
    thanks to the underlying Date::Manip module.
 beancounter fxbackpopulate --prevdate '1 year ago' \
                          --date 'friday 1 week ago' CAD EUR GBP
    This backpopulates the database with historic prices for these
    three currencies. Note how the date specification is very general
    thanks to the underlying Date::Manip module.
    Unfortunately, Yahoo! is a little bone-headed in its implementation
    of historic FX rates -- these are stored to only two decimals 
    precision, just like stockprices. Unfortunately, convention is to
    use at least four if not six. Because of the limited information, 
    risk from FX changes will be underestimated.
 beancounter plreport --prevdate '1 month ago' --date 'today' \
                        --restriction &quot;owner='joe'&quot;
    This calculates portfolio profits or losses over the last month. It
    also imposes the database restriction that only stocks owned by
    'joe' are to be included.
 beancounter status --restriction &quot;type='401k'&quot;
    This shows a portfolio status report with the restriction that only
    stocks from the '401k' account are to be included.
 beancounter risk --prevdate &quot;6 month ago&quot;
    This shows a portfolio risk report. This tries describes the 
    statistically plausible loss which should be exceeded only 1 out
    of 100 times (see below for more details).
 beancounter dailyjob --forceupdate today
    Run a complete 'job': update the database, show a day-end profit/loss
    report, show a portfolio status report and show a riskreport. In the
    update mode, override a potentially wrong date supplied by Yahoo!
    with the current date.
 beancounter split --splitby 3 --prevdate 1990-01-01 ABC CDE
    Split-adjusts the (hypothetical) stocks ABC and CDE by a factor
    of three: price data in the database is divided by three, volume
    increased by 3 and similarly, in the portfolio shares are increased
    and cost is descreased.  Default dates are --prevdate and --date
    which may need adjusting.
</pre>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="TUTORIAL"><a class="selflink" href="#TUTORIAL">TUTORIAL</a></h1>
The following few paragraphs will illustrate the use of <b>beancounter</b>. We
  will set up two fictional accounts for two brothers Bob and Bill (so that we
  can illustrate the 'owner' column). The prices below are completely
  fictitious, as are the portfolios.
<div class="Pp"></div>
We suppose that <b>beancounter</b> is installed and that the
  <b>setup_beancounter</b> command has been run. We can then create a two-stock
  (computer hardware) portfolio for Bob as follows:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 beancounter addportfolio SPY:50:USD:401k:bob:142.25:20000620 \
                          IBM:100:USD:401k:bob:90.25:20000320
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Here we specify that 100 shares each of SPY and IBM, priced in US Dollars, are
  in Bob's portfolio which is tagged as a 401k retirement account. The
  (fictitious) purchase price and date are also given.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Let's suppose that Bill prefers networking equipment, and that he has a
  brokerage account in Canada:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 beancounter addportfolio CSCO:100:USD:spec:bill:78.00:19990817 \
                          NT.TO:200:CAD:spec:bill:cad:90.25:20000212
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Now we can backpopulate the database from 1998 onwards for all four stocks:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 beancounter backpopulate --prevdate 19980101 CSCO IBM NT.TO SPY
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
With this historical data in place, we now compare how Bob's portfolio would
  have fared over the last 18 months:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 beancounter plreport --prevdate '18 months ago' \
                        --restriction &quot;owner='bob'&quot;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note how we use double quotes to protect the arguments, and how the SQL
  restriction contains a further single quote around the literal string.
<div class="Pp"></div>
We can also review the performance for Bill at the most recent trading day:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 beancounter dayendreport --restriction &quot;owner='bill'&quot;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
or the status of holdings and their respective values:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 beancounter dayendreport --restriction &quot;owner='bill'&quot;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Similarly, a risk reports can be run on this portfolios per
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 beancounter risk --restriction &quot;owner='bill'&quot;
</pre>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="MORE_DETAILED_COMMAND_DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#MORE_DETAILED_COMMAND_DESCRIPTION">MORE
  DETAILED COMMAND DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>addportfolio</b> is the most important 'position entry' command. As with
  other commands, several arguments can be given at the same time. For each of
  these, records are separated using a colon and specify, in order, stock
  symbol, number of stocks held, currency, account type, account owner, purchase
  price and purchase date. Only the first three arguments are required, the
  others are optional. Executing <b>addportfolio</b> implicitly executes
  <b>addstock</b>. The account type column can be used to specify whether the
  account is, e.g., a tax-sheltered retirement account, or it could be used to
  denote the brokerage company is it held at.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>plreport</b> retrieves the most recent quotes(s). This is useful for illiquid
  securities which might not have traded that day, or if a public holiday
  occurred, or if there was a data error at Yahoo!. Two dates can be specified
  which determine the period over which the profit or loss is computed. This
  will fail if price data (or currency data in the case of foreign stocks data)
  data is not available for either of those two dates. This may be restrictive
  for foreign stocks where we cannot backpopulate due to lack of public data
  source for historical currency quotes. Major currencies can be retrieved from
  Yahoo!, but only to two decimals precisions.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>dayendreport</b> is similar to <b>plreport</b> but is always over a one-day
  period. It also uses only one date record by calculating performance given the
  'previous close' data.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>status</b> shows holdings amounts, total position values, annualized returns
  in percentages and holding periods in days. Note that the annualized returns
  can appear excessive if, e.g., a ten-day return from a recently purchased
  stock is extrapolated to an annual time period.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>risk</b> shows a portfolio risk report which describes the statistically
  plausible loss which should be exceeded only 1 out of 100 times. In other
  words, the loss estimate has a critical level of 99%. This risk level is
  estimated via two methods. The first is non-parametric and assumes no
  particular model or distribution; it computes the 1% quintile of the return
  distribution and displays it as well as the corresponding asset value at risk.
  The second method uses the standard Value-at-Risk (VaR) approach. This uses
  the 1% critical value of the Normal distribution and implicitly assumes a
  normal distribution for returns. See &quot;http://www.gloriamundi.org&quot;
  for more introduction and references. If the distribution of normalitty was
  perfectly true, both measures would coincide. A large difference between the
  two estimates would indicate that the return distribution might be rather
  non-normal. Another view of the riskiness of a given position is provided by
  the last column with the 'margVaR' heading. It shows the marginal
  Value-at-Risk. Marginal VaR is commonly defined as the risk contribution of
  the given position to the total portfolio, and calculated as the difference in
  the VaR of the full portfolio and the VaR of an otherwise identical portfolio
  with the given position removed. Note that calculating marginal VaR is fairly
  slow (on the order of O(n^3) ].
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>retracement</b> shows a 'drawdown' report. Drawdown is commonly defined as
  the percentage loss relative to the previous high. The default period is used,
  but can be altered with the <b>--date</b> and <b>--prevdate</b> options. The
  default period is also corrected for the actual holding period. In other
  words, if a stock has been held for two months, only those two months are used
  instead of the default of six months -- but if the last months has been
  selected via <b>--prevdate</b> then it is used. For short positions, the
  analysis is inverted and relative to the previous low. The report displays
  each stock, the number of shares held, the current price and holdings value.
  The next two columns show the maximum price attained in the examined period,
  and the percent decline relative to it. The last column shows the unrealized
  loss relative to the maximum price over the period. The aggregate holdings
  value, percent decline and unrealized loss are shown as well.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>advancement</b> does the opposite of drawdown -- it computes unrealized gains
  relative to the minimum price in the period. The discussion in the preceding
  paragraph applies `but inverted'.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>lsportfolio</b> simply lists the content of the portfolio table. A SQL
  restriction can be imposed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>addindex</b> adds stocks a the index table. Currently, no further analysis
  references this table.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>addstock</b> adds stocks to the database. From then on data will be retrieved
  for the given symbol(s) and stored in the database whenever the <b>update</b>
  command is executed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>backpopulate</b> fills the database with historic prices for the given
  symbols and date period. Note that this works well for stocks and mutual fund.
  Options have no historic data stored. Currencies are stored with limited
  precision as noted above.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>quote</b> simply shows a price quote for the given symbol(s).
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>update</b> updates the database with quotes for all stocks for the given day.
  No output is generated making the command suitable for <b>cron</b> execution.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>dailyjob</b> is a simple convenience wrapper around <b>update</b>,
  <b>dayendreport</b>, <b>status</b> and <b>risk</b>,
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>allreports</b> is a another covenience wrapper around <b>dayendreport</b>,
  <b>status</b> and <b>risk</b>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>deactivate</b> will set the active column in stockinfo for the given
  symbol(s) to false thereby inhibiting any further updates of symbol(s). The
  existing data for symbol(s) is retained. Use this when a stock is acquired,
  delisted, or you simply want to stop tracking it -- but do not want to purge
  the historical data.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>split</b> adjusts the price database, and the portfolio holdings, for stock
  splits. The default factor is 2, this can be adjusted with the option
  <b>--splitby</b>. The dates arguments can be set with <b>--prevdate</b> and
  <b>--date</b>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>delete</b> removes the given symbols from the database.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>destroydb</b> deletes the BeanCounter database.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>checkdbconnection</b> simply opens and closes the database handle, and
  returns a specified exit code which can then be tested. This is used in the
  <b>setup_beancounter</b> command.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>warranty</b> display a short GNU General Public License statement.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="MORE_DETAILED_OPTION_DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#MORE_DETAILED_OPTION_DESCRIPTION">MORE
  DETAILED OPTION DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>--currency</b> can be used to select a different <i>home</i> currency.
  Instead of having all values converted to the default currency, the selected
  currency is used.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--date</b> allows to choose a different reference date. This is then be be
  used by commands working on a date, or date period, such as <b>plreport</b>,
  <b>dayendreport</b>, <b>backpopulate</b>, <b>fxbackpopulate</b> or
  <b>status</b>. <b>--prevdate</b> allows to choose a different start date for
  return calculations, or data gathering.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--restriction</b> can be used to restrict the database selection. The
  argument must be a valid part of valid SQL statement in the sense that
  existing columns and operators have to be employed. The argument to this
  option will be completed with a leading <i>and</i>. The SQL restriction will
  typcally be over elements of the <i>portfolio</i> table which comprises the
  columns <i>symbol</i>, <i>shares</i>, <i>currency</i>, <i>type</i>,
  <i>owner</i>, <i>cost</i> and <i>date</i>. A simple example would be
  <i>currency='CAD'</i>. Note that this has to protected by double quotes
  <i>&quot;I</i> on the command-line.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--extrafx</b> allows to gather data on additional currency rates beyond those
  automatically selected as shares are listed in them. A typical example would
  be for a European investor wanting to convert from the EUR in which the shares
  are listed into one of the member currencies which <b>beancounter</b> would no
  longer retrieve as shares are no longer listed in these.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--forceupdate</b> allows to overwrite an potentially wrong date in the
  database update. Unfortunately, it appears that Yahoo! occasionally reports
  correct prices with an incorrect date such as the previous day's. In such a
  case, this option, along with an argument such as 'today' can override the bad
  date datapoint and avoid a hole in the database. The downside of this approach
  is that it would &quot;double&quot; the previous data in the case of a public
  holiday, or even if it was run the weekend. A somewhat smarter comparison to
  previously stored data might prevent that, but would be more complex to
  implement.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--rcfile</b> allows to specify a resource file different from the default
  <i>~/.beancounterrc</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--dbsystem</b> allows to switch to a different database backend. The default
  is <b>PostgreSQL</b> but <b>MySQL</b> and <b>SQLite</b> are also supported.
  For <b>SQLite</b>, the default is now version 3.* but the previous version --
  which is not binarily compatible -- is supported as well with argument
  'SQLite2'.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--dbname</b> allows to switch to an alternate database. The default is
  'beancounter'. This can be useful for testing new features.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--fxupdate</b> is a boolean switch to enforece updates of FX rates during
  'update'. The default is 'true' but '--nofxupdate' can be used to suppress the
  update of foreign exchange rates.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Similarly, <b>--equityupdate</b> is a boolean switch to enforece, or suppress
  updates of Equity (i.e. stock) data during 'update'. The default is 'true' but
  '--noequityupdate' can be used to suppress the update of foreign exchange
  rates.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--ubcfx</b> is a boolean switch to use the 'PACIFIC' FX rate service from the
  Sauder School at UBC. This is useful when the default FX rate service at
  Yahoo! is erratic, or unreliable. While the PACIFIC server provides a wider
  variety of exchange rates, Yahoo! can still be useful as it can provide more
  columns (open/high/low). However, during most of 2005, Yahoo! has been
  unrealiable for the exchange rates and has not provided historical FX data. On
  the other hand, the UBC service does not run on Canadian holidays so it cannot
  really server as a full substitute. Contributions for a new data acquisition,
  maybe via www.oanda.com would be welcome.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--splitby</b> can be used to set a stock split factor other than the default
  of 2.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--host</b> can be used to point to a machine containing the PostgreSQL or
  MySQL database. The machine can be remote, or it can be the actual machine
  <b>beancounter</b> is running on. If a hostname is given, tcp/ip connection
  are used. If no hostname is given, the default value of 'localhost' implies
  that local socket connections are used which may be easier to employ for less
  experienced adatabase users.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Also, <b>--commit</b> is a boolean switch to suppress actual database updates if
  the negated <b>--nocommit</b> is selected. This is useful mostly in debugging
  contexts.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>--verbose</b> and <b>--debug</b> switches can be used in debugging an
  testing, and <b>--help</b> triggers the display of help message.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYSTEM_OVERVIEW"><a class="selflink" href="#SYSTEM_OVERVIEW">SYSTEM
  OVERVIEW</a></h1>
The following section details some of the database and configuration options.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="DATABASE_REQUIREMENTS"><a class="selflink" href="#DATABASE_REQUIREMENTS">DATABASE
  REQUIREMENTS</a></h2>
<b>beancounter</b> currently depends on either PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite
  (version 2 or 3) or any other database for which an ODBC driver is available
  (though the required tables would have to created manually in the ODBC case).
  Yet another DB backend could be added provided suitable Perl DBI drivers are
  available. For PostgreSQL, MySQL and SQLite, the <b>setup_beancounter</b>
  script can create and initialize the database, form the required tables and
  fills them with some example data. It is a starting point for local
  modifications.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The connection to the database is made via a dedicated function in the
  <b>BeanCounter.pm</b> module, changes would only have to be made there. As of
  this writing the <b>Perl DBI</b> (the database-independent interface for Perl)
  is used along the DBI drivers for PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite and ODBC. Ports
  for Oracle, Sybase, ... are encouraged.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="CONFIG_FILE"><a class="selflink" href="#CONFIG_FILE">CONFIG
  FILE</a></h2>
A configuration file <i>~/.beancounterrc</i> is read if found. It currently
  supports the following options:

  CONFIGURATION</a></h2>
There are now several ODBC systems available for Linux / Unix. The following
  <i>~/.odbc.ini</i> work with the <b>iODBC</b> library and the
  <b>PostgreSQL</b> ODBC driver on my Debian GNU/Linux system:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   [ODBC Data Sources]
   beancounter = BeanCounter Database
   [beancounter]
   Driver       = /usr/lib/libpsqlodbc.so
   Database     = beancounter
   Servername   = localhost
   [ODBC]
   InstallDir = /usr/lib
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Alternatively, the <b>unixODBC</b> library can be used with the following scheme
  for <i>/etc/odbcinst.ini</i> (or <i>~/.odbcinst.ini</i>) to define the
  Postgres database drivers
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   [PostgreSQL]
   Description     = PostgreSQL ODBC driver for Linux and Windows
   Driver          = /usr/lib/postgresql/lib/libodbcpsql.so
   Setup           = /usr/lib/odbc/libodbcpsqlS.so
   Debug           = 0
   CommLog         = 0
   FileUsage       = 1
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
after which <i>/etc/odbc.ini</i> (or <i>~/.odbc.ini</i>) can be used to define
  actual data sources as follows:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   [PostgreSQL]
   Description     = PostgreSQL template1
   Driver          = PostgreSQL
   Trace           = No
   TraceFile       = /tmp/odbc.log
   Database        = template1
   Servername      = localhost
   UserName        =
   Password        =
   Port            = 5432
   Protocol        = 6.4
   ReadOnly        = Yes
   RowVersioning   = No
   ShowSystemTables= No
   ShowOidColumn   = No
   FakeOidIndex    = No
   ConnSettings    =
   [beancounter]
   Description     = Beancounter DB (Postgresql)
   Driver          = Postgresql
   Trace           = No
   TraceFile       =
   Database        = beancounter
   Servername      = some.db.host.com
   UserName        =
   Password        =
   Port            = 5432
   Protocol        = 6.4
   ReadOnly        = No
   RowVersioning   = No
   ShowSystemTables= No
   ShowOidColumn   = No
   FakeOidIndex    = No
   ConnSettings    =
