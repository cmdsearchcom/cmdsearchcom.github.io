<p>RENICE(1POSIX) POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s Manual
RENICE(1POSIX)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROLOG <br>
This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s
Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of <br>
Linux behavior), or the interface may not be implemented on
Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
renice &acirc; set nice values of running processes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
renice [&acirc;g|&acirc;p|&acirc;u] &acirc;n increment
ID...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The renice utility shall request that the nice values (see
the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008, Section
3.240, Nice Value) of one or more running processes be
changed. By <br>
default, the applicable processes are specified by their
process IDs. When a process group is specified (see
&acirc;g), the request shall apply to all processes in the
process group.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The nice value shall be bounded
in an implementation-defined manner. If the requested
increment would raise or lower the nice value of the
executed utility beyond implementa&acirc; <br>
tion-defined limits, then the limit whose value was exceeded
shall be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a user is reniced, the
request applies to all processes whose saved set-user-ID
matches the user ID corresponding to the user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Regardless of which options are
supplied or any other factor, renice shall not alter the
nice values of any process unless the user requesting such a
change has appropriate priv&acirc; <br>
ileges to do so for the specified process. If the user lacks
appropriate privileges to perform the requested action, the
utility shall return an error status.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The saved set-user-ID of the
user&rsquo;s process shall be checked instead of its
effective user ID when renice attempts to determine the user
ID of the process in order to determine <br>
whether the user has appropriate privileges.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The renice utility shall conform to the Base Definitions
volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax
Guidelines, except for Guideline 9.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options shall be
supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;g Interpret the following
operands as unsigned decimal integer process group IDs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;n increment <br>
Specify how the nice value of the specified process or
processes is to be adjusted. The increment option-argument
is a positive or negative decimal integer that shall <br>
be used to modify the nice value of the specified process or
processes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Positive increment values shall
cause a lower nice value. Negative increment values may
require appropriate privileges and shall cause a higher nice
value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;p Interpret the following
operands as unsigned decimal integer process IDs. The
&acirc;p option is the default if no options are
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;u Interpret the following
operands as users. If a user exists with a user name equal
to the operand, then the user ID of that user is used in
further processing. Other&acirc; <br>
wise, if the operand represents an unsigned decimal integer,
it shall be used as the numeric user ID of the user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERANDS <br>
The following operands shall be supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ID A process ID, process group
ID, or user name/user ID, depending on the option
selected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDIN <br>
Not used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUT FILES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
The following environment variables shall affect the
execution of renice:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LANG Provide a default value for
the internationalization variables that are unset or null.
(See the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008,
Section 8.2, Internationaliza&acirc; <br>
tion Variables for the precedence of internationalization
variables used to determine the values of locale
categories.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_ALL If set to a non-empty
string value, override the values of all the other
internationalization variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_CTYPE Determine the locale
for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text data as
characters (for example, single-byte as opposed to
multi-byte characters in argu&acirc; <br>
ments).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_MESSAGES <br>
Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
standard error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NLSPATH Determine the location
of message catalogs for the processing of LC_MESSAGES.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDOUT <br>
Not used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDERR <br>
The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT FILES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTENDED DESCRIPTION <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The following exit values shall be returned:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 Successful completion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following sections are
informative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">APPLICATION USAGE <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
1. Adjust the nice value so that process IDs 987 and 32
would have a lower nice value:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">renice &acirc;n 5 &acirc;p 987
32</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Adjust the nice value so that
group IDs 324 and 76 would have a higher nice value, if the
user has appropriate privileges to do so:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">renice &acirc;n &acirc;4
&acirc;g 324 76</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. Adjust the nice value so that
numeric user ID 8 and user sas would have a lower nice
value:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">renice &acirc;n 4 &acirc;u 8
sas</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Useful nice value increments on
historical systems include 19 or 20 (the affected processes
run only when nothing else in the system attempts to run)
and any negative number (to <br>
make processes run faster).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RATIONALE <br>
The gid, pid, and user specifications do not fit either the
definition of operand or option-argument. However, for
clarity, they have been included in the OPTIONS section,
rather <br>
than the OPERANDS section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The definition of nice value is
not intended to suggest that all processes in a system have
priorities that are comparable. Scheduling policy extensions
such as the realtime pri&acirc; <br>
orities in the System Interfaces volume of
POSIX.1&acirc;2008 make the notion of a single underlying
priority for all scheduling policies problematic. Some
implementations may imple&acirc; <br>
ment the nice-related features to affect all processes on
the system, others to affect just the general time-sharing
activities implied by this volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008, and
others <br>
may have no effect at all. Because of the use of
&lsquo;&lsquo;implementation-defined&rsquo;&rsquo; in nice
and renice, a wide range of implementation strategies are
possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Originally, this utility was
written in the historical manner, using the term
&lsquo;&lsquo;nice value&rsquo;&rsquo;. This was always a
point of concern with users because it was never intuitively
obvi&acirc; <br>
ous what this meant. With a newer version of renice, which
used the term &lsquo;&lsquo;system scheduling
priority&rsquo;&rsquo;, it was hoped that novice users could
better understand what this utility <br>
was meant to do. Also, it would be easier to document what
the utility was meant to do. Unfortunately, the addition of
the POSIX realtime scheduling capabilities introduced the
<br>
concepts of process and thread scheduling priorities that
were totally unaffected by the nice/renice utilities or the
nice()/setpriority() functions. Continuing to use the term
<br>
&lsquo;&lsquo;system scheduling priority&rsquo;&rsquo; would
have incorrectly suggested that these utilities and
functions were indeed affecting these realtime priorities.
It was decided to revert to <br>
the historical term &lsquo;&lsquo;nice value&rsquo;&rsquo;
to reference this unrelated process attribute.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Although this utility has use by
system administrators (and in fact appears in the system
administration portion of the BSD documentation), the
standard developers considered <br>
that it was very useful for individual end users to control
their own processes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Earlier versions of this
standard allowed the following forms in the SYNOPSIS:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">renice nice_value[&acirc;p]
pid...[&acirc;g gid...][&acirc;p pid...][&acirc;u user...]
<br>
renice nice_value &acirc;g gid...[&acirc;g gid...]&acirc;p
pid...][&acirc;u user...] <br>
renice nice_value &acirc;u user...[&acirc;g gid...]&acirc;p
pid...][&acirc;u user...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These forms are no longer
specified by POSIX.1&acirc;2008 but may be present in some
implementations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FUTURE DIRECTIONS <br>
None.</p>
