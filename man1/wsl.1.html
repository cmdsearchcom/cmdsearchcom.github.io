<p>WSL(1) User Commands WSL(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
wsl - A shell based command line client for WSMAN
servers</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
wsl (aka &quot;whistle&quot;) contains various scripts that
serve as a client interface to WSMAN or Web Services for
Management protocol based on DMTF standard specification.
WSMAN pro&acirc; <br>
vides standards based messaging for systems management
CIM-style objects.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To talk to a remote WSMAN
service, start with &quot;wsl id check&quot;. This command
will request the IP address, user name and password for the
remote server and populate a file &quot;.wslrun&quot; <br>
in the current directory. After the first run, you can use
the commands listed below without having to provide IP
address, user name and password repeatedly. This is the
default <br>
behavior. However, you can configure wsl so that it always
ask for IP address or IP address and user credential for
each command in case you want to work with more than one
tar&acirc; <br>
get.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The environmental variables that
could affect the behavior of wsl are listed in README
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Help information is provided at
different levels. Typing &quot;wsl&quot; provides help
information about available commands. Typing &quot;wsl
enum&quot; provides help information about enum command <br>
and its parameters. Typing &quot;wsl enum help&quot; gives
the same information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
e|enum|enumerate <br>
Sends SOAP message with WS-MAN ENUMERATE command. Equivalent
to calling &quot;wslenum&quot; directly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">id|identify <br>
Sends SOAP message with WS-MAN IDENTIFY command. Equivalent
to calling &quot;wslid&quot; directly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">i|invoke <br>
Sends SOAP message with WS-MAN INVOKE command. Equivalent to
callint &quot;wslinvoke&quot; directly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">g|get Sends SOAP message with
WS-MAN GET command. Equivalent to calling &quot;wslget&quot;
directly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">p|put Sends SOAP message with
WS-MAN PUT command. Equivalent to calling &quot;wslput&quot;
directly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">s|set See put.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xcert Command to extract SSL
certificate of the server hosting WSMAN.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xclean Command to remove/delete
the files generated by this tool.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xcred Command to encrypt
username and password to a file. The same command can be
used for decrypting the same file for verification.
Equivalent to calling &quot;wslcred&quot; directly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHENTICATION <br>
wsl supports basic and digest authentication mechanism. You
will be prompted for user name and password at run time or
you can provide their values to environment variables <br>
WSUSER and WSPASS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A more secure method is to use
the light encryption method provided by wsl. See the xcred
command option. It will create a credential file that
contains the encrypted form of the <br>
user name and password. To use, simply provide the filename
to WSUSER prefixed with &quot;FILE:&quot;. You do not have
to provide WSPASS in this case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
~/.wslrc <br>
This file contains custom user-configurable information that
could affect the behavior of wsl. If not present, this file
is created the firt time wsl is used. Refer to <br>
README file for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$PWD/.wslrun <br>
This file contains environment variables that are populated
the first time wsl is run and used on subsequent runs. It
includes user password so if security is a concern, <br>
try to use the encrypted version (see xcred command) or you
may turn off creation of this file using the custom user
configuration (see .wslrc).</p>
