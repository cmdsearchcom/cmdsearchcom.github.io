<p>FvwmButtons(1) Fvwm Modules FvwmButtons(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
FvwmButtons - the fvwm buttonbox module</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
Module FvwmButtons [-g geometry] [-transient |
-transientpanel] [name[configfile]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FvwmButtons can only be invoked
by fvwm. Command line invocation of the FvwmButtons module
will not work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The FvwmButtons module provides a window of buttons which
sits on the X terminal&rsquo;s root window. The user can
press the buttons at any time, and trigger invocation of a
user-spec&acirc; <br>
ified command by the window manager. FvwmButtons only works
when fvwm is used as the window manager.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The buttonbox can be of any
configuration or geometry, and can have monochrome or color
icons to represent the actions which would be invoked. Even
other applications can be <br>
&rsquo;swallowed&rsquo; by the button bar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Panels that are opened on a
button press are available too. See CREATING PANELS section
for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The -g option specifies the geometry of the main window. The
command line option takes precedence over any other geometry
settings in the configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -transient option tells
FvwmButtons to terminate itself after the first key or
button press has been received (presses to open a sub panel
do not count) or a sub panel has <br>
been closed or respawned. This is especially useful for sub
panels where you want to select a single button and have it
closed automatically. It could be used to create two- <br>
dimensional graphical menus. Since -transient is an option,
not a configuration setting you can use the same
configuration for transient and non transient button
bars.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -transientpanel option does
roughly the same as the -transient option, but instead of
closing the whole button bar, the window is merely hidden.
This is very useful if the <br>
button bar is started as a subpanel of another button bar
because it avoids that it must be started again when
something is selected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INVOCATION <br>
FvwmButtons is spawned by fvwm, so command line invocation
will not work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FvwmButtons can be invoked by
inserting the line &rsquo;Module FvwmButtons
OptionalName&rsquo; in the .fvwm2rc file. This should be
placed in the StartFunction if FvwmButtons is to be <br>
spawned during fvwm&rsquo;s initialization. This can be
bound to a menu or mouse button or keystroke to invoke it
later.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When invoked with the
OptionalName argument, the OptionalName is used to find
configuration commands. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AddToFunc StartFunction Module
FvwmButtons MyButtonBox</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FvwmButtons will then use only
the lines starting with &quot;*MyButtonBox&quot;, instead of
the default &quot;*FvwmButtons&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION OPTIONS <br>
The following commands are understood by FvwmButtons:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmButtons: Back color <br>
Specifies the background color for the buttons. The relief
and shadow color are calculated from the background
color.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmButtons: BoxSize algorithm
<br>
This option specifies how serious FvwmButtons takes the Rows
and Columns options (see below). It can be one of dumb,
fixed or smart.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If fixed is used and both Rows
and Columns are specified and non-zero, FvwmButtons uses
exactly the number of rows and columns specified. If the box
is too small to <br>
accommodate all buttons the module will fail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If smart is used FvwmButtons
enlarges the box so all buttons have a chance to fit. The
number of columns is increased to at least the width of the
widest button and new <br>
rows are added until all buttons are placed. For the best
tolerance of configuration errors use the smart option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dumb is neither fixed nor smart.
This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmButtons: Colorset colorset
<br>
Tells the module to use colorset colorset for the window
background. Refer to the fvwm man page for details about
colorsets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmButtons: ActiveColorset
colorset <br>
Tells the module to use colorset colorset for the background
color/image and/or title color of a button when the mouse is
hovering above a button.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmButtons: PressColorset
colorset <br>
Tells the module to use colorset colorset for the background
color/image and/or title color of a button when it is
pressed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmButtons: Columns columns
<br>
Specifies the number of columns of buttons to be created. If
unspecified, the number of columns is set to the number of
buttons requested, divided by the number of rows. <br>
If both the rows and columns are specified, but the number
of buttons is more than the rows and columns allow for, the
columns specification is ignored unless the BoxSize <br>
option is fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmButtons: File filename <br>
Specifies that the configuration for this button is found in
the file filename. Filename can be a full pathname, or is
assumed to be in fvwm&rsquo;s startup directory. The
con&acirc; <br>
figuration file is in the same format as fvwm&rsquo;s
configuration file, but each line is read as if prefixed by
&quot;*FvwmButtons&quot;. Comments are given by starting a
line with &quot;#&quot;. <br>
Line continuation is done by ending a line with a &quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmButtons: Font font <br>
Specifies the font to be used for labeling the buttons, or
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmButtons: Fore color <br>
Specifies the color used for button label text and
monochrome icons.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmButtons: Frame width <br>
Specifies the width of the relief around each button. If
this is a negative number, the relief is inverted. This
makes the button sunken normally and raised when acti&acirc;
<br>
vated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmButtons: Geometry geometry
<br>
Specifies the FvwmButtons window location and size. The
geometry is a standard X11 window geometry
specification.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmButtons: ButtonGeometry
geometry <br>
This option works like the Geometry option except that the
size is the size of a single button. The size of the whole
FvwmButtons window is calculated by multiplying the <br>
button dimension by the number of rows and columns.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmButtons: Padding width
height <br>
This option specifies the default horizontal padding to be
width pixels, and the vertical padding to be height pixels.
The amount of free space between the relief of the <br>
button and its contents is normally 2 pixels on the sides
and 4 pixels above and below, except for swallowed windows
and containers, which are not padded at all, unless <br>
this option is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmButtons: Pixmap pixmapfile
<br>
Specifies a background pixmap to use. Specify
&quot;none&quot; (without the double quotes) for a
transparent background.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmButtons: Rows rows <br>
Specifies the number of rows of buttons to be created. The
default is 2 rows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmButtons: (options) [title
icon command] <br>
Specifies the contents of a button in the buttonbox. The
following options, separated by commas or whitespace, can be
given a button:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">geometry <br>
Specifies the size and position of the button within the
FvwmButtons window or container. The geometry is a standard
X11 window geometry specification. The button <br>
is width times the normal button width and height times the
normal button height. If values for x and y are given, the
button is placed x (y) button units from the <br>
left (top) of the container if x (y) is positive and x (y)
units from the right (bottom) if x (y) is negative. Buttons
with position arguments (x and y) are placed <br>
before those without them. If two or more buttons are forced
to overlap by this, FvwmButtons exits with an error
message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Action [(options)] command <br>
Specifies an fvwm command to be executed when the button is
activated by pressing return or a mouse button. The command
needs to be quoted if it contains a comma or <br>
a closing parenthesis.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The current options of the
Action are: Mouse n - this action is only executed for mouse
button n. One action can be defined for each mouse button,
in addition to <br>
the general action.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the command part, you can use
a number of predefined variables: $left, $right, $top and
$bottom are substituted by the left, right, top and bottom
coordinates of <br>
the button pressed. $-left, $-right, $-top and $-bottom are
substituted likewise, but the coordinates are calculated
from the bottom or the right edge of the screen <br>
instead (for a button that is 5 pixels away from the right
screen border, $-right will be 5). $width and $height are
replaced by the width or height of the button. <br>
The variables $fg and $bg are replaced with the name of the
foreground or background color set with the Back or Fore
option (see below). All this is done regardless <br>
of any quoting characters. To get a literal &rsquo;$&rsquo;
use the string &rsquo;$$&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmButtons: (Title xload,
Action (Mouse 1) &lsquo;Exec exec xload -fg $fg -bg $bg
-geometry -3000-3000&lsquo;)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: With fvwm versions prior
to 2.5.0, actions could not be assigned to a button that
swallowed an application window (see Swallow option). Such
actions worked <br>
only when the border around the button was clicked. This is
now possible, but to get back the old behavior, the
ActionIgnoresClientWindow can be used on the but&acirc; <br>
ton:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmButtons: (Action beep,
ActionIgnoresClientWindow, Swallow xeyes &quot;Exec exec
xeyes&quot;)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In this example, the action is
only executed when you click on the border of the button or
the transparent part of the xeyes window, but not on the
xeyes window <br>
itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ActionIgnoresClientWindow <br>
See the note in the description of Action above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ActionOnPress <br>
Usually the action is executed on the button release except
for the Popup action. This option changes this behavior, the
action is executed on the button press. <br>
This may be good, for example, with Menu or SendToModule
that generates popups, or when Frame is 0 and the button
would look unresponsive otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Back color <br>
Specifies the background color to be used drawing this box.
A relief color and a shadow color are calculated from
this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Center The contents of the
button is centered on the button. This is the default but
may be changed by Left or Right.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Top The contents of the button
is vertically aligned at the top of the button. The default
is to vertically center it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Colorset colorset <br>
The given colorset can be applied to a container, a
swallowed application and a simple button. To apply it to a
button or container, simply put the option in a <br>
line with a button or container description. Drawing
backgrounds for individual buttons and containers with
colorsets requires a lot of communication with the X <br>
server. So if you are not content with the drawing speed of
dozens of buttons with colorset backgrounds, do not use
colorsets here. Setting colorsets as the back&acirc; <br>
ground of swallowed applications does not have this
restriction but depends entirely on the swallowed
application. It may work as you wish, but since it involves
<br>
fiddling with other applications&rsquo; windows there is no
guarantee for anything. I have tested three applications:
xosview works nicely with a colorset background, <br>
xload works only with a VGradient or solid background and an
analog xclock leaves a trail painted in the background color
after its hands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the swallowed window is an
fvwm module (see the (No)FvwmModule option to Swallow), then
the colorset is not applied to the swallowed module. You
should use the <br>
colorset in the module configuration. If the swallowed
module has a transparent colorset background, then the
FvwmButtons background (and not the button colorset) <br>
is seen by transparency of the background of the swallowed
module. Refer to the fvwm man page for details about
colorsets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ActiveColorset colorset <br>
Use colorset colorset for the background color/image and/or
title color of the button when the mouse is hovering above
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PressColorset colorset <br>
Use colorset colorset for the background color/image and/or
title color of the button when it is pressed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Container [(options)] <br>
Specifies that this button will contain a miniature
buttonbox, equivalent to swallowing another FvwmButtons
module. The options are the same as can be given for a <br>
single button, but they affect all the contained buttons.
Options available for this use are Back, Font, Fore, Frame
and Padding. Flags for Title and Swallow <br>
options can be set with Title(flags) and Swallow(flags). You
should also specify either &quot;Columns width&quot; or
&quot;Rows height&quot;, or &quot;Rows 2&quot; will be
assumed. For an exam&acirc; <br>
ple, see the Sample configuration section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The container button itself
(separate from the contents) can take format options like
Frame and Padding, and commands can be bound to it. This
means you can make a <br>
sensitive relief around a container, like</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmButtons: (2x2, Frame 5,
Padding 2 2, Action Beep, Container(Frame 1))</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Typically you will want to at
least give the container a size setting widthxheight.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">End Specifies that no more
buttons are defined for the current container, and further
buttons will be put in the container&rsquo;s parent. This
option should be given on a <br>
line by itself, i.e</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmButtons: (End)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Font fontname <br>
Specifies that the font fontname is to be used for labeling
this button.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fore color <br>
Specifies the foregound color of the title and monochrome
icons in this button.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Frame width <br>
The relief of the button will be width pixels wide. If width
is given as a negative number, the relief is inverted. This
makes the button sunken normally and raised <br>
when activated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Icon filename <br>
The name of an image file, containing the icon to display on
the button. FvwmButtons searches through the path specified
in the fvwm ImagePath configuration item <br>
to find the icon file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ActiveIcon filename <br>
The name of an image file, containing an alternative icon to
display on the button when the mouse is hovering above the
button. If no ActiveIcon is specified, the <br>
image specified by Icon is displayed (if there is one).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PressIcon filename <br>
The name of an image file, containing an alternative icon to
display on the button when the button is pressed. If no
PressIcon is specified, the image specified by <br>
Icon is displayed (if there is one).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Id id The id to be used to
identify this button. The first character of the id should
be alphabetic. See also the &quot;DYNAMICAL ACTIONS&quot;
section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Left The contents of the button
are aligned to the left. The default is to center the
contents on the button.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NoSize This option specifies
that this button will not be considered at all when making
the initial calculations of button sizes. Useful for the odd
button that gets just <br>
a couple of pixels too large to keep in line, and therefor
blows up your whole buttonbox. &quot;NoSize&quot; is
equivalent to &quot;Size 0 0&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Padding width height <br>
The amount of free space between the relief of the button
and its contents is normally 2 pixels to the sides and 4
pixels above and below, except for swallowed win&acirc; <br>
dows and containers, which are by default not padded at all.
This option sets the horizontal padding to width and the
vertical padding to height.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Panel [ (options) ] hangon
command <br>
Panels can be swallowed exactly like windows are swallowed
by buttons with the Swallow command below, but they are not
displayed within the button. Instead they <br>
are hidden until the user presses the panel&rsquo;s button.
Then the panel (the window of the swallowed application)
opens with a sliding animation. The options can be <br>
any of the flags described for the Swallow command. In
addition a direction &rsquo;left&rsquo;,
&rsquo;right&rsquo;, &rsquo;up&rsquo; or &rsquo;down&rsquo;
can be used to specify the sliding direction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The steps animation-steps option
defines the number of animation steps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The delay ms option sets the
delay between the steps of the animation in milliseconds.
Use zero for no delay. The maximum delay is 10 seconds
(10000). It doesn&rsquo;t <br>
make any sense to use the delay option unless you also use
the smooth option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The smooth option causes the
panel to redraw between the steps of the animation. The
sliding animation may be smoother this way, it depends on
the application, <br>
and display speed. The application may appear to grow
instead of sliding out. The animation may be slower.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Hints option causes
FvwmButtons to use the applications size hints to calculate
the size of the animation steps. Hints is the default. If
the number of steps <br>
is not what you want, try using NoHints.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The noborder option tells
FvwmButtons to ignore the borders of the window when
calculating positions for the animation (equivalent to set
noplr and noptb in the <br>
position option).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With the indicator option set,
FvwmButtons will draw a small triangle in the button that
will open a panel. The triangle points in the direction
where the panel <br>
will pop up. The indicator keyword may be followed by a
positive integer that specifies the maximum width and height
of the indicator. Without this size FvwmBut&acirc; <br>
tons will make the indicator fit the button. You will
probably want to use the Padding option to leave a few
pixels between the indicator and the frame of the but&acirc;
<br>
ton.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The position option allows one
to place the panel. The syntax is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">position [context-window] [pos]
[x y] [border-opts]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The argument context-window can
be one of: Button, Module or Root. The context-window is the
window from which panel percentage offsets are calculated.
Button <br>
specifies the panel&rsquo;s button, Module specifies
FvwmButtons itself, and Root specifies a virtual screen. The
context-window together with the sliding direction <br>
define a line segment which is one of the borders of the
context-window: the top/bottom/left/right border for sliding
up/down/left/right.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The pos argument can be one of:
center, left or right (for sliding up or a down) or top or
bottom (for sliding left or right). It defines the vertical
(sliding up <br>
and down) or the horizontal (sliding left and right)
position of the Panel on the line segment. For example, for
a sliding up if you use a left pos, then the left <br>
borders of the panel and of the context-window will be
aligned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The offset values x and y
specify how far the panel is moved from it&rsquo;s default
position. By default, the numeric value given is interpreted
as a percentage of the <br>
context window&rsquo;s width (height). A trailing
&quot;p&quot; changes the interpretation to mean
&quot;pixels&quot;. All offset calculations are relative to
the buttons location, even when <br>
using a root context.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The border-opts are: mlr, mtb,
noplr and noptb. They define which border widths are taken
in account. By default, the borders of FvwmButtons are not
taken in <br>
account. mlr reverses this default for the left and the
right border and mtb reverses this default for the top and
the bottom border. Conversely, by default the <br>
borders of the Panel are taken in account. noplr reverses
this default for the left and the right border and noptb
reverses this default for the top and the bottom <br>
border.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The defaults are sliding up with
a delay of five milliseconds and twelve animation steps. To
post the panel without any animation, set the number of
steps to zero. <br>
The default position is &rsquo;Button center&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please refer to the CREATING
PANELS section for further information on panels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># To include the panel in a
button <br>
*FvwmButtons: (Panel(down, delay 0, steps 16) SubPanel
&quot;Module FvwmButtons SubPanel&quot;)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># To define the panel as an
instance of <br>
# FvwmButtons with a different name: <br>
*SubPanel: (Icon my_lock.xpm, Action Exec xlock) <br>
*SubPanel: (Icon my_move.xpm, Action Move) <br>
...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Right The contents of the button
are aligned to the right. The default is to center the
contents on the button.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Size width height <br>
Specifies that the contents of this button require width by
height pixels, regardless of what size FvwmButtons
calculates from the icon and the title. A button bar <br>
with only swallowed windows will not get very large without
this option specified, as FvwmButtons does not consider
sizes for swallowing buttons. Note that this <br>
option gives the minimum space assured; other buttons might
require the buttonbox to use larger sizes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Swallow [(flags)] hangon command
<br>
Causes FvwmButtons to execute command, and when a window
with a name, class or resource matching hangon appears, it
is captured and swallowed into this button. The <br>
hangon string may contain wildcard characters
(&rsquo;*&rsquo;) that match any substring. Swallow replaces
the variables $fg and $bg as described above for the Action
option <br>
(but if you use the UseOld and NoClose options the
application is not be restarted when FvwmButtons is
restarted and thus does not get the new colors - if you <br>
changed them). An example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmButtons: (Swallow XClock
&rsquo;Exec xclock -geometry -3000-3000 &amp;&rsquo;)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">takes the first window whose
name, class, or resource is &quot;XClock&quot; and displays
it in the button. If no matching window is found, the
&quot;Exec&quot; command creates one. <br>
The argument &quot;-geometry -3000-3000&quot; is used so
that the window is first drawn out of sight before its
swallowed into FvwmButtons.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Modules can be swallowed by
specifying the module instead of &rsquo;Exec
whatever&rsquo;, like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmButtons: (Swallow
&quot;FvwmPager&quot; &quot;FvwmPager 0 0&quot;)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The flags that can be given to
swallow are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NoClose / Close - Specifies
whether the swallowed program in this button will be
un-swallowed or closed when FvwmButtons exits cleanly.
&quot;NoClose&quot; can be combined <br>
with &quot;UseOld&quot; to have windows survive a restart of
the window manager. The default setting is
&quot;Close&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NoHints / Hints - Specifies
whether hints from the swallowed program in this button will
be ignored or not, useful in forcing a window to resize
itself to fit its <br>
button. The default value is &quot;Hints&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NoKill / Kill - Specifies
whether the swallowed program will be closed by killing it
or by sending a message to it. This can be useful in ending
programs that <br>
doesn&rsquo;t accept window manager protocol. The default
value is &quot;NoKill&quot;. This has no effect if
&quot;NoClose&quot; is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NoRespawn / Respawn / SwallowNew
- Specifies whether the swallowed program is to be respawned
(restarted) if it dies. If &quot;Respawn&quot; is specified,
the program is <br>
respawned using the original command. Use this option with
care, the program might have a legitimate reason to die. If
&quot;SwallowNew&quot; is given, the program is not <br>
respawned, but if a new window with the specified name
appears, it is swallowed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NoOld / UseOld - Specifies
whether the button will try to swallow an existing window
matching the hangon name before spawning one itself with
command. The hangon <br>
string may contain wildcard characters (&rsquo;*&rsquo;)
that match any substring.The default value is
&quot;NoOld&quot;. &quot;UseOld&quot; can be combined with
&quot;NoKill&quot; to have windows survive a <br>
restart of the window manager. If you want FvwmButtons to
swallow an old window, and not spawn one itself if failing,
let the command be &quot;Nop&quot;:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmButtons: (Swallow (UseOld)
&quot;Console&quot; Nop)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to be able to start
it yourself, combine it with an action:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmButtons: (Swallow (UseOld)
&quot;Console&quot; Nop, Action &lsquo;Exec
&quot;Console&quot; console &amp;&lsquo;)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NoTitle / UseTitle - Specifies
whether the title of the button will be taken from the
swallowed window&rsquo;s title or not. If
&quot;UseTitle&quot; is given, the title on the but&acirc;
<br>
ton changes dynamically to reflect the window name. The
default is &quot;NoTitle&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NoFvwmModule / FvwmModule - By
default, FvwmButtons treats the swallowed window as an fvwm
module window if the 4 first letters of the command is
&quot;Fvwm&quot; or the 6 <br>
first letters of the command is &quot;Module&quot;.
NoFvwmModule and FvwmModule override this logic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Title [(options)] name <br>
Specifies the title to be written on the button. Whitespace
can be included in the title by quoting it. If a title at
any time is too long for its buttons, charac&acirc; <br>
ters are chopped of one at a time until it fits. If justify
is &quot;Right&quot;, the head is removed, otherwise its
tail is removed. These options can be given to Title:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Center - The title is centered
horizontally. This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Left - The title is justified to
the left side.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Right - The title is justified
to the right side.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Side - Causes the title to
appear on the right hand side of any icon or swallowed
window, instead of below which is the default. If you use
small icons, and combine <br>
this with the &quot;Left&quot; or &quot;Right&quot; option,
you can get a look similar to fvwm&rsquo;s menus.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ActiveTitle name <br>
Specifies the title to be written on the button when the
mouse is hovering above the button. If no ActiveTitle is
specified, the text specified by Title is dis&acirc; <br>
played (if there is any).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PressTitle name <br>
Specifies the title to be written on the button when the
button is pressed. If no PressTitle is specified, the text
specified by Title is displayed (if there is <br>
any).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Legacy fields [title icon
command] <br>
These fields are kept for compatibility with previous
versions of FvwmButtons, and their use is discouraged. The
title field is similar to the option Title name. If <br>
the title field is &quot;-&quot;, no title is displayed. The
icon field is similar to the option Icon filename. If the
icon field is &quot;-&quot; no icon is displayed. The
command <br>
field is similar to the option Action command or
alternatively Swallow &quot;hangon&quot; command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The command <br>
Any fvwm command is recognized by FvwmButtons. See fvwm(1)
for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Exec command has a small
extension when used in Actions, its syntax is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Exec [&quot;hangon&quot;]
command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmButtons: (Action Exec
&quot;xload&quot; xload)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The hangon string must be
enclosed in double quotes. When FvwmButtons finds such an
Exec command, the button remains pushed in until a window
whose name, class or <br>
resource matches the quoted portion of the command is
encountered. This is intended to provide visual feedback to
the user that the action he has requested will be <br>
performed. The hangon string may contain wildcard characters
(&rsquo;*&rsquo;) that match any substring. If the quoted
portion contains no characters, then the button will pop
<br>
out immediately. Note that users can continue pressing the
button, and re-executing the command, even when it looks
pressed in.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Quoting <br>
Any string which contains whitespace must be quoted.
Contrary to earlier versions commands no longer need to be
quoted. In this case any quoting character will be <br>
passed on to the application untouched. Only commas
&rsquo;,&rsquo; and closing parentheses &rsquo;)&rsquo; have
to be quoted inside a command. Quoting can be done with any
of the three <br>
quotation characters; single quote:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&rsquo;This is a
&quot;quote&quot;&rsquo;,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">double quote:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;It&rsquo;s another
&lsquo;quote&rsquo;&quot;,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and back quote:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;This is a strange
quote&lsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The back quoting is unusual but
used on purpose, if you use a preprocessor like FvwmCpp and
want it to get into your commands, like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#define BG gray60 <br>
*FvwmButtons: (Swallow &quot;xload&quot; &lsquo;Exec xload
-bg BG &amp;&lsquo;)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any single character can be
quoted with a preceding backslash &rsquo;&acute;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CREATING PANELS <br>
Former versions of FvwmButtons (fvwm 2.0.46 to 2.3.6) had a
different way of handling panels. You can not use your old
panel configuration with the new panel feature. Read <br>
&quot;CONVERTING OLD PANEL CONFIGURATIONS&quot; for more
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOW TO CREATE NEW PANELS <br>
Any program that can be launched from within fvwm and that
has a window can be used as a panel. A terminal window could
be your panel, or some application like xload or xosview
<br>
or another fvwm module, including FvwmButtons itself. All
you need to know is how to start your application from
fvwm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The button that invokes the
panel is as easily configured as any other button.
Essentially you need nothing more than the Panel option:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmButtons: (Panel
my_first_panel &quot;Module FvwmButtons -g -30000-30000
my_first_panel&quot;) <br>
*FvwmButtons: (Panel my_second_panel &quot;Exec exec xterm
-g -30000-30000 -n my_second_panel&quot;)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This works like the Swallow
option. The difference is that the application is not put
into the button when it starts up but instead hidden from
view. When you press the button <br>
for the panel the window slides into view. The &rsquo;-g
-30000-30000&rsquo; option tells the application that it
should be created somewhere very far to the top and left of
your visible <br>
screen. Otherwise you would see it flashing for a moment
when FvwmButtons starts up. Some applications do not work
well with this kind of syntax so you may have to live with
<br>
the short flashing of the window. If you want to make a
panel from another instance of FvwmButtons you can do so,
but you must give it a different name
(&rsquo;my_first_panel&rsquo; in <br>
above example). If you run FvwmButtons under the same name,
new panels are created recursively until your system runs
out of resources and FvwmButtons crashes! To configure a
<br>
second button bar with a different name, simply put
&rsquo;*new_name&rsquo; in place of
&rsquo;*FvwmButtons&rsquo; in your configuration file. If
you are not familiar with the Swallow option or if you <br>
want to learn more about how &rsquo;swallowing&rsquo; panels
works, refer to the description of the Swallow option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Now that your panel basically
works you will want to tune it a bit. You may not want a
window title on the panel. To disable the title use the fvwm
Style command. If your but&acirc; <br>
ton bar is &rsquo;sticky&rsquo; you may want to make the
panel sticky too. And probably the panel window should have
no icon in case it is iconified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Style name_of_panel_window
NoTitle, Sitcky, NoIcon</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may want your panel to stay
open only until you select something in it. You can give
FvwmButtons the -transientpanel option after the -g option
in the command. FvwmPager has <br>
a similar option &rsquo;-transient&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Last, but not least, you can now
put an icon, a title or a small arrow in the button so that
you can see what it is for. A title or icon can be specified
as usual. To activate <br>
the arrow, just add &rsquo;(indicator)&rsquo; after the
&rsquo;Panel&rsquo; keyword in the example above and the
Padding option to leave a few pixels between the arrow and
the border of the button. An <br>
optional direction in which the panel is opened can be given
too:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmButtons: (Padding 2,
Panel(down, indicator) my_first_panel &quot;Module
FvwmButtons -g -30000-30000 -transientpanel
my_first_panel&quot;)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are several more options
to configure how your panel works, for example the speed and
smoothness of the sliding animation. Please refer to the
description of the Panel <br>
option for further details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONVERTING OLD PANEL
CONFIGURATIONS <br>
This section describes how to convert a pretty old syntax
used in 2.2.x versions. You may skip it if your syntax is
more recent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With the old panel feature you
first had one or more lines defining panels in your main
FvwmButtons configuration:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">... <br>
*FvwmButtons(Title WinOps,Panel WinOps) <br>
*FvwmButtons(Title Tools ,Panel Tools) <br>
...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After the last configuration
line for the main panel the configuration of the first panel
followed, introduced with a line beginning with
*FvwmButtonsPanel:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmButtonsPanel WinOps <br>
*FvwmButtonsBack bisque2 <br>
...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmButtonsPanel Tools <br>
*FvwmButtonsBack bisque2 <br>
...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">And perhaps you had style
commands for you panels:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Style FvwmButtonsPanel Title,
NoHandles, BorderWidth 0 <br>
Style FvwmButtonsPanel NoButton 2, NoButton 4, Sticky</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The new configuration looks much
the same, but now the configuration of the main panel is
independent of the configuration of the sub panels. The
lines invoking the panels use <br>
the same syntax as the Swallow option, so you simply add the
name of the window to use as a panel and the command to
execute instead of the panel name. Note that you give the
<br>
new instance of FvwmButtons a different name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmButtons: (Title WinOps,
Panel WinOps &quot;Module FvwmButtons WinOps&quot;) <br>
*FvwmButtons: (Title Tools , Panel Tools &quot;Module
FvwmButtons Tools&quot;)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you used something like
&rsquo;Panel-d&rsquo; you now have to use
&rsquo;Panel(down)&rsquo; instead. To make the new panel
vanish as soon as a button was selected start FvwmButtons
with the &rsquo;-tran&acirc; <br>
sientpanel&rsquo; option:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmButtons: (Title Tools ,
Panel(down) Tools &quot;Module FvwmButtons -transientpanel
Tools&quot;)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The rest of the configuration is
very easy to change. Delete the lines
&rsquo;*FvwmButtonsPanel &lt;name&gt;&rsquo; and add
&lt;name&gt; to all of the following configuration lines for
the panel <br>
instead. Use the same name in your Style commands:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*WinOps: Back bisque2 <br>
... <br>
*Tools: Back bisque2 <br>
... <br>
Style &quot;WinOps&quot; Title, NoHandles, BorderWidth 0
<br>
Style &quot;WinOps&quot; NoButton 2, NoButton 4, Sticky <br>
Style &quot;Tools&quot; Title, NoHandles, BorderWidth 0 <br>
Style &quot;Tools&quot; NoButton 2, NoButton 4, Sticky</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">That&rsquo;s it. The new panels
are much more flexible. Please refer to other parts of this
documentation for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WHY WAS THE PANEL FEATURE
REWRITTEN? <br>
There are several reasons. The most important one is that
the program code implementing the panels was very disruptive
and caused a lot of problems. At the same time it made <br>
writing new features for FvwmButtons difficult at best. The
second reason is that most users were simply unable to make
it work - it was way too complicated. Even I (the author
<br>
of the new code) had to spend several hours before I got it
working the first time. The third reason is that the new
panels are more versatile. Any application can be a panel
<br>
in FvwmButtons, not just other instances of FvwmButtons
itself. So I sincerely hope that nobody is angry about the
change. Yes - you have to change your configuration, but the
<br>
new feature is much easier to configure, especially if you
already know how the Swallow option works.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ARRANGEMENT ALGORITHM <br>
FvwmButtons tries to arrange its buttons as best it can, by
using recursively, on each container including the buttonbox
itself, the following algorithm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Getting the size right <br>
First it calculates the number of button unit areas it will
need, by adding the width times the height in buttons of
each button. Containers are for the moment considered <br>
a normal button. Then it considers the given rows and
columns arguments. If the number of rows is given, it will
calculate how many columns are needed, and stick to that,
<br>
unless columns is larger, in which case you will get some
empty space at the bottom of the buttonbox. If the number of
columns is given, it calculates how many rows it <br>
needs to fit all the buttons. If neither is given, it
assumes you want two rows, and finds the number of columns
from that. If the BoxSize option is set to smart at least
<br>
the height/width of the tallest/widest button is used while
the fixed value prevents the box from getting resized if
both rows and columns have been set to non-zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Shuffling buttons <br>
Now it has a large enough area to place the buttons in, all
that is left is to place them right. There are two kinds of
buttons: fixed and floating buttons. A fixed button <br>
is forced to a specific slot in the button box by a x/y
geometry argument. All other buttons are considered
floating. Fixed buttons are placed first. Should a fixed
button <br>
overlap another one or shall be place outside the buttons
window, FvwmButtons exits with an error message. After that
the floating buttons are placed. The algorithm tries <br>
to place the buttons in a left to right, top to bottom
western fashion. If a button fits at the suggested position
it is placed there, if not the current slot stays empty <br>
and the slot to the right will be considered. After the
button has been placed, the next button is tried to be
placed in the next slot and so on until all buttons are <br>
placed. Additional rows are added below the bottom line of
buttons until all buttons are placed if necessary if the
BoxSize option smart is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Containers <br>
Containers are arranged by the same algorithm, in fact they
are shuffled recursively as the algorithm finds them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Clarifying example <br>
An example might be useful here: Suppose you have 6 buttons,
all unit sized except number two, which is 2x2. This makes
for 5 times 1 plus 1 times 4 equals 9 unit buttons <br>
total area. Assume you have requested 3 columns.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1) +---+---+---+ 2)
+---+---+---+ 3) +---+---+---+ <br>
| 1 | | | 1 | | | 1 | | <br>
+---+ + +---+ 2 + +---+ 2 + <br>
| | | | | | 3 | | <br>
+ + + +---+---+ +---+---+---+ <br>
| | | | | | | | <br>
+-----------+ +---+-------+ +---+---+---+</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4) +---+---+---+ 5)
+---+-------+ 6) +---+-------+ <br>
| 1 | | | 1 | | | 1 | | <br>
+---+ 2 + +---+ 2 | +---+ 2 | <br>
| 3 | | | 3 | | | 3 | | <br>
+---+---+---+ +---+---+---+ +---+-------+ <br>
| 4 | | | 4 | 5 | | | 4 | 5 | 6 | <br>
+---+---+---+ +---+---+---+ +---+---+---+</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">What size will the buttons be?
<br>
When FvwmButtons has read the icons and fonts that are
required by its configuration, it can find out which size is
needed for every non-swallowing button. The unit button <br>
size of a container is set to be large enough to hold the
largest button in it without squeezing it. Swallowed windows
are simply expected to be comfortable with the but&acirc;
<br>
ton size they get from this scheme. If a particular
configuration requires more space for a swallowed window, it
can be set in that button&rsquo;s configuration line using
the <br>
option &quot;Size width height&quot;. This will tell
FvwmButtons to give this button at least width by height
pixels inside the relief and padding.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DYNAMICAL ACTIONS <br>
A running FvwmButtons instance may receive some commands at
run time. This is achieved using the fvwm command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SendToModule FvwmButtons-Alias
&lt;action&gt; &lt;params&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Supported actions:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ChangeButton button_id options
<br>
can be used to change the title or icon of a button at run
time. button_id is the id of the button to change as
specified using the Id button option. It may also be a <br>
number, in this case the button with the given number is
assumed. And finally, button_id may be in the form +x+y,
where x and y are a column number and a row number of <br>
the button to be changed. It is possible to specify multiple
option pairs (name with value) by delimiting them using
comma. Currently options include Title, ActiveTitle, <br>
PressTitle, Colorset, Icon, ActiveIcon and PressIcon. These
options work like the configuration options of the same
name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ExpandButtonVars button_id
command <br>
replaces variables present in the command exactly like in
the Action button option and then sends the command back to
fvwm. button_id has the same syntax as described in <br>
ChangeButton above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PressButton button_id
[mouse_button] <br>
simulates a mouse click on a button. button_id is the id of
the button to press as specified using the Id button option
and mouse_button is the number of mouse button <br>
used to click on the button e.g &quot;1&quot; for the left
mouse button etc. Quotes around the number are not
necessary. If mouse_button option is omitted, mouse button 1
is <br>
assumed. This command behaves exactly as if the mouse button
was pressed and released on the button on in question.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Silent This prefix may be
specified before other actions. It disables all possible
error and warning messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmButtons: (Id note1, Title
&quot;13:30 - Dinner&quot;, Icon clock1.xpm)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SendToModule FvwmButtons Silent
