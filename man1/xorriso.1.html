<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
xorriso - creates, loads, manipulates and writes ISO 9660
filesystem images with Rock Ridge extensions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
xorriso [settings|actions]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
xorriso is a program which copies file objects from POSIX
compliant filesystems into Rock Ridge enhanced ISO 9660
filesystems and performs session-wise manipulation of such
<br>
filesystems. It can load the management information of
existing ISO images and it writes the session results to
optical media or to filesystem objects. <br>
Vice versa xorriso is able to copy file objects out of ISO
9660 filesystems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A special property of xorriso is
that it needs neither an external ISO 9660 formatter program
nor an external burn program for CD, DVD or BD but rather
incorporates the libraries <br>
of libburnia-project.org .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Overview of features: <br>
Operates on an existing ISO image or creates a new one. <br>
Copies files from disk filesystem into the ISO image. <br>
Copies files from ISO image to disk filesystem (see
osirrox). <br>
Renames or deletes file objects in the ISO image. <br>
Changes file properties in the ISO image. <br>
Updates ISO subtrees incrementally to match given disk
subtrees. <br>
Writes result either as completely new image or as add-on
session to optical media or filesystem objects. <br>
Can activate ISOLINUX and GRUB boot images via El Torito and
MBR. <br>
Can perform multi-session tasks as emulation of mkisofs and
cdrecord. <br>
Can record and restore hard links and ACL. <br>
Content may get zisofs compressed or filtered by external
processes. <br>
Can issue commands to mount older sessions on GNU/Linux or
FreeBSD. <br>
Can check media for damages and copy readable blocks to
disk. <br>
Can attach MD5 checksums to each data file and the whole
session. <br>
Scans for optical drives, blanks re-useable optical media.
<br>
Reads its instructions from command line arguments, dialog,
and files. <br>
Provides navigation commands for interactive ISO image
manipulation. <br>
Adjustable thresholds for abort, exit value, and problem
reporting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that xorriso does not write
audio CDs and that it does not produce UDF filesystems which
are specified for official video DVD or BD.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Maybe you first want to have a
look at section EXAMPLES near the end of this text before
reading the next few hundred lines of background
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Session model: <br>
Unlike other filesystems, ISO 9660 (aka ECMA-119) is not
intended for read-write operation but rather for being
generated in a single sweep and being written to media as a
<br>
session. <br>
The data content of the session is called filesystem
image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The written image in its session
can then be mounted by the operating system for being used
read-only. GNU/Linux is able to mount ISO images from block
devices, which may <br>
represent optical media, other media or via a loop device
even from regular disk files. FreeBSD mounts ISO images from
devices that represent arbitrary media or from regular disk
<br>
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This session usage model has
been extended on CD media by the concept of multi-session ,
which adds information to the CD and gives the mount
programs of the operating systems <br>
the addresses of the entry points of each session. The mount
programs recognize block devices which represent CD media
and will by default mount the image in the last session.
<br>
This session usually contains an updated directory tree for
the whole medium which governs the data contents in all
recorded sessions. So in the view of the mount program all
<br>
sessions of a particular medium together form a single
filesystem image. <br>
Adding a session to an existing ISO image is in this text
referred as growing. <br>
The multi-session model of the MMC standard does not apply
to all media types. But program growisofs by Andy Polyakov
showed how to extend this functionality to overwriteable
<br>
media or disk files which carry valid ISO 9660
filesystems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xorriso provides growing as well
as an own method named modifying which produces a completely
new ISO image from the old one and the modifications. See
paragraph Creating, <br>
Growing, Modifying, Blind Growing below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xorriso adopts the concept of
multi-session by loading an image directory tree if present,
by offering to manipulate it by several actions, and by
writing the new image to the <br>
target medium. <br>
The first session of a xorriso run begins by the definition
of the input drive with the ISO image or by the definition
of an output drive. The session ends by command -commit <br>
which triggers writing. A -commit is done automatically when
the program ends regularly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After -commit a new session
begins with the freshly written one as input. A new input
drive can only be chosen as long as the loaded ISO image was
not altered. Pending <br>
alteration can be revoked by command -rollback.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Writing a session to the target
is supposed to be very expensive in terms of time and of
consumed space on appendable or write-once media. Therefore
all intended manipulations of <br>
a particular ISO image should be done in a single session.
But in principle it is possible to store intermediate states
and to continue with image manipulations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Media types and states: <br>
There are two families of media in the MMC standard: <br>
Multi-session media are CD-R, CD-RW, DVD-R, DVD+R, DVD+R/DL,
BD-R, and unformatted DVD-RW. These media provide a table of
content which describes their existing sessions. See <br>
command -toc. <br>
Similar to multi-session media are DVD-R DL and minimally
blanked DVD-RW. They record only a single session of which
the size must be known in advance. xorriso will write onto
<br>
them only if command -close is set to &quot;on&quot;. <br>
Overwriteable media are DVD-RAM, DVD+RW, BD-RE, and
formatted DVD-RW. They offer random write access but do not
provide information about their session history. If they
contain <br>
one or more ISO 9660 sessions and if the first session was
written by xorriso, then a table of content can be emulated.
Else only a single overall session will be visible. <br>
DVD-RW media can be formatted by -format &quot;full&quot;.
They can be made unformatted by -blank &quot;deformat&quot;.
<br>
Regular files and block devices are handled as overwriteable
media. Pipes and other writeable file types are handled as
blank multi-session media.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These media can assume several
states in which they offer different capabilities. <br>
Blank media can be written from scratch. They contain no ISO
image suitable for xorriso. <br>
Blank is the state of newly purchased optical media. With
used CD-RW and DVD-RW it can be achieved by action -blank
&quot;as_needed&quot;. Overwriteable media are considered
blank if <br>
they are new or if they have been marked as blank by
xorriso. Action -blank &quot;as_needed&quot; can be used to
do this marking on overwriteable media, or to apply
mandatory formatting <br>
to new media if necessary. <br>
Appendable media accept further sessions. Either they are
MMC multi-session media in appendable state, or they are
overwriteable media which contain an ISO image suitable for
<br>
xorriso. <br>
Appendable is the state after writing a session with command
-close off. <br>
Closed media cannot be written. They may contain an ISO
image suitable for xorriso. <br>
Closed is the state of DVD-ROM media and of multi-session
media which were written with command -close on. If the
drive is read-only hardware then it will probably show any
media <br>
as closed CD-ROM or DVD-ROM. <br>
Overwriteable media assume this state in such read-only
drives or if they contain unrecognizable data in the first
32 data blocks. <br>
Read-only drives may or may not show session histories of
multi-session media. Often only the first and the last
session are visible. Sometimes not even that. Command <br>
-rom_toc_scan might or might not help in such cases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Creating, Growing, Modifying,
Blind Growing: <br>
A new empty ISO image gets created if there is no input
drive with a valid ISO 9660 image when the first time an
output drive is defined. This is achieved by command -dev on
<br>
blank media or by command -outdev on media in any state.
<br>
The new empty image can be populated with directories and
files. Before it can be written, the medium in the output
drive must get into blank state if it was not blank
already.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If there is a input drive with a
valid ISO image, then this image gets loaded as foundation
for manipulations and extension. The constellation of input
and output drive <br>
determines which write method will be used. They have quite
different capabilities and constraints.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The method of growing adds new
data to the existing data on the medium. These data comprise
of new file content and they override the existing ISO 9660
+ Rock Ridge directory <br>
tree. It is possible to hide files from previous sessions
but they still exist on the medium and with many types of
optical media it is quite easy to recover them by mounting
<br>
older sessions. <br>
Growing is achieved by command -dev.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The write method of modifying
produces compact filesystem images with no outdated files or
directory trees. Modifying can write its images to target
media which are completely <br>
unsuitable for multi-session operations. E.g. DVD-RW which
were treated with -blank deformat_quickest, DVD-R DL, named
pipes, character devices, sockets. On the other hand <br>
modified sessions cannot be written to appendable media but
to blank media only. <br>
So for this method one needs either two optical drives or
has to work with filesystem objects as source and/or target
medium. <br>
Modifying takes place if input drive and output drive are
not the same and if command -grow_blindly is set to its
default &quot;off&quot;. This is achieved by commands -indev
and -outdev.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If command -grow_blindly is set
to a non-negative number and if -indev and -outdev are both
set to different drives, then blind growing is performed. It
produces an add-on <br>
session which is ready for being written to the given block
address. This is the usage model of <br>
mkisofs -M $indev -C $msc1,$msc2 -o $outdev <br>
which gives much room for wrong parameter combinations and
should thus only be employed if a strict distinction between
ISO formatter xorriso and the burn program is desired. -C
<br>
$msc1,$msc2 is equivalent to: <br>
-load sbsector $msc1 -grow_blindly $msc2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Libburn drives: <br>
Input drive, i.e. source of an existing or empty ISO image,
can be any random access readable libburn drive: optical
media with readable data, blank optical media, regular
files, <br>
block devices. <br>
Output drive, i.e. target for writing, can be any libburn
drive. Some drive types do not support the method of growing
but only the methods of modifying and blind growing. They
<br>
all are suitable for newly created images.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All drive file objects have to
offer rw-permission to the user of xorriso. Even those which
will not be useable for reading an ISO image. <br>
With any type of drive object, the data are considered to be
organized in blocks of 2 KiB. Access happens in terms of
Logical Block Address (LBA) which gives the number of a <br>
particular data block.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MMC compliant (i.e. optical)
drives on GNU/Linux usually get addressed by the path of
their block device or of their generic character device.
E.g. <br>
-dev /dev/sr0 <br>
-dev /dev/hdc <br>
-dev /dev/sg2 <br>
By default xorriso will try to map the given address to
/dev/hd* and /dev/sr*. The command -scsi_dev_family can
redirect the mapping from sr to scd or sg. The latter does
not <br>
suffer from the concurrency problems which plague /dev/sr of
Linux kernels since version 3. But it does not yield the
same addresses which are used by mount(8) or by open(2) for
<br>
read(2). <br>
On FreeBSD the device files have names like <br>
-dev /dev/cd0 <br>
On NetBSD: <br>
-dev /dev/rcd0d <br>
On OpenSolaris: <br>
-dev /dev/rdsk/c4t0d0s2 <br>
Get a list of accessible drives by command <br>
-device_links <br>
It might be necessary to do this as superuser in order to
see all drives and to then allow rw-access for the intended
users. Consider to bundle the authorized users in a group
<br>
like old &quot;floppy&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Filesystem objects of nearly any
type can be addressed by prefix &quot;stdio:&quot; and their
path in the filesystem. E.g.: <br>
-dev stdio:/dev/sdc <br>
The default setting of -drive_class allows the user to
address files outside the /dev tree without that prefix.
E.g.: <br>
-dev /tmp/pseudo_drive <br>
If path leads to a regular file or to a block device then
the emulated drive is random access readable and can be used
for the method of growing if it already contains a valid
<br>
ISO 9660 image. Any other file type is not readable via
&quot;stdio:&quot; and can only be used as target for the
method of modifying or blind growing. Non-existing paths in
existing <br>
directories are handled as empty regular files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A very special kind of pseudo
drive are open file descriptors. They are depicted by
&quot;stdio:/dev/fd/&quot; and descriptor number (see man 2
open). <br>
Addresses &quot;-&quot; or &quot;stdio:/dev/fd/1&quot;
depict standard output, which normally is the output channel
for result texts. To prevent a fatal intermingling of ISO
image and text <br>
messages, all result texts get redirected to stderr if -*dev
&quot;-&quot; or &quot;stdio:/dev/fd/1&quot; is among the
start arguments of the program. <br>
Standard output is currently suitable for creating one
session per program run without dialog. Use in other
situations is discouraged and several restrictions apply:
<br>
It is not allowed to use standard output as pseudo drive if
it was not among the start arguments. Do not try to fool
this ban via backdoor addresses to stdout. <br>
If stdout is used as drive, then -use_readline is
permanently disabled. Use of backdoors can cause severe
memory and/or tty corruption.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Be aware that especially the
superuser can write into any accessible file or device by
using its path with the &quot;stdio:&quot; prefix. By
default any address in the /dev tree without <br>
prefix &quot;stdio:&quot; will work only if it leads to a
MMC drive. <br>
One may use command -ban_stdio_write to surely prevent this
risk and to restrict drive usage to MMC drives. <br>
One may prepend &quot;mmc:&quot; to a path to surely
disallow any automatic &quot;stdio:&quot;. <br>
By command -drive_class one may ban certain paths or allow
access without prefix &quot;stdio:&quot; to other paths.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Rock Ridge, POSIX, X/Open, El
Torito, ACL, xattr: <br>
Rock Ridge is the name of a set of additional information
which enhance an ISO 9660 filesystem so that it can
represent a POSIX compliant filesystem with ownership,
access <br>
permissions, symbolic links, and other attributes. <br>
This is what xorriso uses for a decent representation of the
disk files within the ISO image. xorriso produces Rock Ridge
information by default. It is strongly discouraged to <br>
disable this feature.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xorriso is not named
&quot;porriso&quot; because POSIX only guarantees 14
characters of filename length. It is the X/Open System
Interface standard XSI which demands a file name length of
<br>
up to 255 characters and paths of up to 1024 characters.
Rock Ridge fulfills this demand.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An El Torito boot record points
the BIOS bootstrapping facility to one or more boot images,
which are binary program files stored in the ISO image. The
content of the boot image <br>
files is not in the scope of El Torito. <br>
Most bootable GNU/Linux CDs are equipped with ISOLINUX or
GRUB boot images. xorriso is able to create or maintain an
El Torito object which makes such an image bootable. For
<br>
details see command -boot_image. <br>
It is possible to make ISO images bootable from USB stick or
other hard-disk-like media. Several options install a MBR
(Master Boot Record), It may get adjusted according to the
<br>
needs of the intended boot firmware and the involved boot
loaders, e.g. GRUB2 or ISOLINUX. A MBR contains boot code
and a partition table. The new MBR of a follow-up session
<br>
can get in effect only on overwriteable media. <br>
MBR is read by PC-BIOS when booting from USB stick or hard
disk, and by PowerPC CHRP or PReP when booting. An MBR
partiton with type 0xee indicates the presence of GPT. <br>
Emulation -as mkisofs supports the example options out of
the ISOLINUX wiki, the options used in GRUB script
grub-mkrescue, and the example in the FreeBSD AvgLiveCD
wiki. <br>
A GPT (GUID Partition Table) marks partitions in a more
modern way. It is read by EFI when booting from USB stick or
hard disk, and may be used for finding and mounting a HFS+
<br>
partition inside the ISO image. <br>
An APM (Apple Partition Map) marks the HFS+ partition. It is
read by Macs for booting and for mounting. <br>
MBR, GPT and APM are combinable. APM occupies the first 8
bytes of MBR boot code. All three do not hamper El Torito
booting from CDROM. <br>
There is support for further facilities: MIPS Big Endian
(SGI), MIPS Little Endian (DEC), SUN SPARC, HP-PA. Those are
mutually not combinable and also not combinable with MBR,
<br>
GPT, or APM.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ACL are an advanced way of
controlling access permissions to file objects. Neither ISO
9660 nor Rock Ridge specify a way to record ACLs. So
libisofs has introduced a standard <br>
conformant extension named AAIP for that purpose. It uses
this extension if enabled by command -acl. <br>
AAIP enhanced images are supposed to be mountable normally,
but one cannot expect that the mounted filesystem will show
and respect the ACLs. For now, only xorriso is able to <br>
retrieve those ACLs. It can bring them into effect when
files get restored to an ACL enabled file system or it can
print them in a format suitable for tool setfacl. <br>
Files with ACL show as group permissions the setting of
entry &quot;mask::&quot; if that entry exists. Nevertheless
the non-listed group members get handled according to entry
&quot;group::&quot;. <br>
When removing ACL from a file, xorriso brings
&quot;group::&quot; into effect. <br>
Recording and restoring of ACLs from and to local files
works currently only on GNU/Linux and FreeBSD.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xattr (aka EA, or extattr) are
pairs of name and value which can be attached to file
objects. AAIP is able to represent them and xorriso can
record and restore pairs which have <br>
names out of the user namespace. I.e. those which begin with
&quot;user.&quot;, like &quot;user.x&quot; or
&quot;user.whatever&quot;. Name has to be a 0 terminated
string. Value may be any array of bytes <br>
which does not exceed the size of 4095 bytes. xattr
processing happens only if it is enabled by command -xattr.
<br>
As with ACL, currently only xorriso is able to retrieve
xattr from AAIP enhanced images, to restore them to xattr
capable file systems, or to print them. <br>
Recording and restoring of xattr from and to local files
works currently only on GNU/Linux and FreeBSD, where they
are known as extattr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Command processing: <br>
Commands are either actions which happen immediately or
settings which influence following actions. So their
sequence does matter, unless they are given as program
arguments and <br>
command -x is among them. <br>
Commands consist of a command word, followed by zero or more
parameter words. If the list of parameter words is of
variable length (indicated by &quot;[...]&quot; or
&quot;[***]&quot;) then it must <br>
be terminated by either the list delimiter, occur at the end
of the argument list, or occur at the end of an input
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At program start the list
delimiter is the string &quot;--&quot;. This may be changed
with the -list_delimiter command in order to allow
&quot;--&quot; as parameter in a variable length list. <br>
However, it is advised to reset the delimiter to
&quot;--&quot; immediately afterwards. <br>
For brevity the list delimiter is referred as &quot;--&quot;
throughout this text. <br>
The list delimiter is silently ignored if it appears after
the parameters of a command with a fixed list length. It is
handled as normal text if it appears among the parameters
<br>
of such a command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pattern expansion converts a
list of pattern words into a list of existing file
addresses. Unmatched pattern words will appear unaltered in
that result list. <br>
Pattern matching supports the usual shell parser wildcards
&rsquo;*&rsquo; &rsquo;?&rsquo; &rsquo;[xyz]&rsquo; and
respects &rsquo;/&rsquo; as the path separator, which may
only be matched literally. <br>
Pattern expansion is a property of some particular commands
and not a general feature. It is controlled by commands
-iso_rr_pattern and -disk_pattern. Commands which use
pattern <br>
expansion all have variable parameter lists which are
specified in this text by &quot;[***]&quot; rather than
&quot;[...]&quot;. <br>
Some other commands perform pattern matching
unconditionally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Command and parameter words are
either read from the program arguments, where one argument
is one word, or from quoted input lines where words are
recognized similar to the <br>
quotation rules of a shell parser. <br>
xorriso is not a shell, although it might appear so at first
glimpse. Be aware that the interaction of quotation marks
and pattern symbols like &quot;*&quot; differs from the
usual shell <br>
parsers. In xorriso, a quotation mark does not make a
pattern symbol literal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Quoted input converts
whitespace-separated text into words. The double quotation
mark &quot; and the single quotation mark &rsquo; can be
used to enclose whitespace and make it part of <br>
words (e.g. of file names). Each mark type can enclose the
marks of the other type. A trailing backslash &nbsp;outside
quotations or an open quotation cause the next input line to
be <br>
appended. <br>
Quoted input accepts any 8-bit character except NUL (0) as
the content of the quotes. Nevertheless it can be cumbersome
for the user to produce those characters directly. <br>
Therefore quoted input and program arguments offer optional
Backslash Interpretation which can represent all 8-bit
characters except NUL (0) via backslash codes as in
$&rsquo;...&rsquo; of <br>
bash. <br>
This is not enabled by default. See command
-backslash_codes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the program starts then it
first looks for argument -no_rc. If this is not present then
it looks for its startup files and reads their content as
command input lines. Then <br>
it interprets the program arguments as commands and
parameters. Finally it enters dialog mode if command -dialog
&quot;on&quot; has been executed by this point.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The program ends either by
command -end, or by the end of program arguments if dialog
mode has not been enabled at that point, or by a problem
event which triggers the threshold <br>
of command -abort_on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Dialog, Readline, Result pager:
<br>
Dialog mode prompts for a quoted input line, parses it into
words, and performs them as commands with their parameters.
It provides assisting services to make dialog more <br>
comfortable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Readline is an enhancement for
the input line. You may already know it from the bash shell.
Whether it is available in xorriso depends on the
availability of package readline-dev <br>
at the time when xorriso was built from its sourcecode. <br>
Readline lets the user move the cursor over the text in the
line by help of the Left and the Right arrow keys. Text may
be inserted at the cursor position. The Delete key <br>
removes the character under the cursor. Up and Down arrow
keys navigate through the history of previous input lines.
<br>
See man readline for more info about libreadline.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Command -page activates a
built-in result text pager which may be convenient in dialog
mode. After an action has output the given number of
terminal lines, the pager prompts the <br>
user for a line of input. <br>
An empty line lets xorriso resume work until the next page
is output. <br>
The single character &quot;@&quot; disables paging for the
current action. <br>
&quot;@@@&quot;, &quot;x&quot;, &quot;q&quot;,
&quot;X&quot;, or &quot;Q&quot; request that the current
action aborts and suppress further result output. <br>
Any other line input will be interpreted as new dialog line.
The current action is requested to abort. Afterwards, the
input line is executed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some actions apply paging to
their info output, too. <br>
The request to abort may or may not be obeyed by the current
action. All actions try to abort as soon as possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
All command words are shown with a leading dash although
this dash is not mandatory for the command to be recognized.
Nevertheless within command -as the dashes of the emulated
<br>
commands are mandatory. <br>
Normally any number of leading dashes is ignored with
command words and inner dashes are interpreted as
underscores.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Execution order of program
arguments:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default the program arguments
of a xorriso run are interpreted as a sequence of commands
which get performed exactly in the given order. This
requires the user to write <br>
commands for desired settings before the commands which
shall be influenced by those settings. <br>
Many other programs support program arguments in an
arbitrary ordering and perform settings and actions in a
sequence at their own discretion. xorriso provides an option
to <br>
enable such a behavior at the cost of loss of
expressivity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x Enable automatic sorting of
program arguments into a sequence that (most likely) is
sensible. This command may be given at any position among
the commands which are <br>
handed over as program arguments. <br>
Note: It works only if it is given as program argument and
with a single dash (i.e. &quot;-x&quot;). It will not work
in startup files, nor with -options_from_file, nor in dialog
<br>
mode, nor as &quot;x&quot; and finally not as
&quot;--x&quot;. It affects only the commands given as
program arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-list_arg_sorting <br>
List all xorriso commands in the order which applies if
command -x is in effect. <br>
This list may also be helpful without -x for a user who
ponders over the sequence in which to put commands.
Deviations from the listed sorting order may well make
sense, <br>
though.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Acquiring source and target
drive:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The effect of acquiring a drive
may depend on several commands in the next paragraph
&quot;Influencing the behavior of image loading&quot;. If
desired, their enabling commands have to be <br>
performed before the commands which acquire the drive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dev address <br>
Set input and output drive to the same address and load an
ISO image if it is present. If there is no ISO image then
create a blank one. Set the image expansion method <br>
to growing. <br>
This is only allowed as long as no changes are pending in
the currently loaded ISO image. If changes are pending, then
one has to perform -commit or -rollback first. <br>
Special address string &quot;-&quot; means standard output,
to which several restrictions apply. See above paragraph
&quot;Libburn drives&quot;. <br>
An empty address string &quot;&quot; gives up the current
device without acquiring a new one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-indev address <br>
Set input drive and load an ISO image if present. If the new
input drive differs from -outdev then switch from growing to
modifying or to blind growing. It depends on <br>
the setting of -grow_blindly which of both gets activated.
The same rules and restrictions apply as with -dev.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-outdev address <br>
Set output drive and if it differs from the input drive then
switch from growing to modifying or to blind growing. Unlike
-dev and -indev this action does not load a new <br>
ISO image. So it can be performed even if there are pending
changes. <br>
-outdev can be performed without previous -dev or -indev. In
that case an empty ISO image with no changes pending is
created. It can either be populated by help of -map, <br>
-add et.al. or it can be discarded silently if -dev or
-indev are performed afterwards. <br>
Special address string &quot;-&quot; means standard output,
to which several restrictions apply. See above paragraph
&quot;Libburn drives&quot;. <br>
An empty address string &quot;&quot; gives up the current
output drive without acquiring a new one. No writing is
possible without an output drive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-scsi_dev_family
&quot;default&quot;|&quot;sr&quot;|&quot;scd&quot;|&quot;sg&quot;
<br>
GNU/Linux specific: <br>
By default, xorriso tries to map Linux drive addresses to
/dev/sr* before they get opened for operating the drive.
This coordinates well with other use cases of optical <br>
drives, like mount(8). But since year 2010 all /dev/sr*
share a global lock which allows only one drive to process
an SCSI command while all others have to wait for its <br>
completion. This yields awful throughput if more than one
drive is writing or reading simultaneously. The global lock
is not applied to device files /dev/sg* and also <br>
not if the xorriso drive address is prepended by
&quot;stdio:&quot;. <br>
So for simultaneous burn runs on modern GNU/Linux it is
advisable to perform -scsi_dev_family &quot;sg&quot; before
any -dev, -indev, or -outdev. The drive addresses may then
well <br>
be given as /dev/sr* but will nevertheless get used as the
matching /dev/sg*. <br>
If you decide so, consider to put the command into a global
startup file like /etc/opt/xorriso/rc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-grow_blindly
&quot;off&quot;|predicted_nwa <br>
If predicted_nwa is a non-negative number then perform blind
growing rather than modifying if -indev and -outdev are set
to different drives. &quot;off&quot; or &quot;-1&quot;
switch to <br>
modifying, which is the default. <br>
predicted_nwa is the block address where the add-on session
of blind growing will finally end up. It is the
responsibility of the user to ensure this final position and
<br>
the presence of the older sessions. Else the overall ISO
image will not be mountable or will produce read errors when
accessing file content. xorriso will write the <br>
session to the address as obtained from examining -outdev
and not necessarily to predicted_nwa. <br>
During a run of blind growing, the input drive is given up
before output begins. The output drive is given up when
writing is done.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Influencing the behavior of
image loading:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following commands should
normally be performed before loading an image by acquiring
an input drive. In rare cases it is desirable to activate
them only after image loading.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-read_speed
code|number[k|m|c|d|b] <br>
Set the speed for reading. Default is &quot;none&quot;,
which avoids to send a speed setting command to the drive
before reading begins. <br>
Further special speed codes are: <br>
&quot;max&quot; (or &quot;0&quot;) selects maximum speed as
announced by the drive. <br>
&quot;min&quot; (or &quot;-1&quot;) selects minimum speed as
announced by the drive. <br>
Speed can be given in media dependent numbers or as a
desired throughput per second in MMC compliant kB (= 1000)
or MB (= 1000 kB). Media x-speed factor can be set <br>
explicitly by &quot;c&quot; for CD, &quot;d&quot; for DVD,
&quot;b&quot; for BD, &quot;x&quot; is optional. <br>
Example speeds: <br>
706k = 706kB/s = 4c = 4xCD <br>
5540k = 5540kB/s = 4d = 4xDVD <br>
If there is no hint about the speed unit attached, then the
medium in the -indev will decide. Default unit is CD =
176.4k. <br>
Depending on the drive, the reported read speeds can be
deceivingly low or high. Therefore &quot;min&quot; cannot
become higher than 1x speed of the involved medium type.
Read speed <br>
&quot;max&quot; cannot become lower than 52xCD, 24xDVD, or
20xBD, depending on the medium type. <br>
MMC drives usually activate their own idea of speed and take
the speed value given by the burn program only as hint for
their own decision.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-load entity id <br>
Load a particular (possibly outdated) ISO session from -dev
or -indev. Usually all available sessions are shown with
command -toc. <br>
entity depicts the kind of addressing. id depicts the
particular address. The following entities are defined: <br>
&quot;auto&quot; with any id addresses the last session in
-toc. This is the default. <br>
&quot;session&quot; with id being a number as of a line
&quot;ISO session&quot;, column &quot;Idx&quot;. <br>
&quot;track&quot; with id being a number as of a line
&quot;ISO track&quot;, column &quot;Idx&quot;. <br>
&quot;lba&quot; or &quot;sbsector&quot; with a number as of
a line &quot;ISO ...&quot;, column &quot;sbsector&quot;.
<br>
&quot;volid&quot; with a search pattern for a text as of a
line &quot;ISO ...&quot;, column &quot;Volume Id&quot;. <br>
Addressing a non-existing entity or one which does not
represent an ISO image will either abandon -indev or at
least lead to a blank image. <br>
If an input drive is set at the moment when -load is
executed, then the addressed ISO image is loaded
immediately. Else, the setting will be pending until the
next -dev or <br>
-indev. After the image has been loaded once, the setting is
valid for -rollback until next -dev or -indev, where it will
be reset to &quot;auto&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-displacement [-]lba <br>
Compensate a displacement of the image versus the start
address for which the image was prepared. This affects only
loading of ISO images and reading of their files. The <br>
multi-session method of growing is not allowed as long as
-displacement is non-zero. I.e. -indev and -outdev must be
different. The displacement gets reset to 0 before the <br>
drive gets re-acquired after writing. <br>
Examples: <br>
If a track of a CD starts at block 123456 and gets copied to
a disk file where it begins at block 0, then this copy can
be loaded with -displacement -123456. <br>
If an ISO image was written onto a partition with offset of
640000 blocks of 512 bytes, then it can be loaded from the
base device by -displacement 160000. <br>
In both cases, the ISO sessions should be self contained,
i.e. not add-on sessions to an ISO image outside their track
or partition.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-drive_class
&quot;harmless&quot;|&quot;banned&quot;|&quot;caution&quot;|&quot;clear_list&quot;
disk_pattern <br>
Add a drive path pattern to one of the safety lists or make
those lists empty. There are three lists defined which get
tested in the following sequence: <br>
If a drive address path matches the &quot;harmless&quot;
list then the drive will be accepted. If it is not a MMC
device then the prefix &quot;stdio:&quot; will be prepended
automatically. <br>
This list is empty by default. <br>
Else if the path matches the &quot;banned&quot; list then
the drive will not be accepted by xorriso but rather lead to
a FAILURE event. This list is empty by default. <br>
Else if the path matches the &quot;caution&quot; list and if
it is not a MMC device, then its address must have the
prefix &quot;stdio:&quot; or it will be rejected. This list
has by default <br>
one entry: &quot;/dev&quot;. <br>
If a drive path matches no list then it is considered
&quot;harmless&quot;. By default these are all paths which
do not begin with directory &quot;/dev&quot;. <br>
A path matches a list if one of its parent paths or itself
matches a list entry. Address prefix &quot;stdio:&quot; or
&quot;mmc:&quot; will be ignored when testing for matches.
<br>
By pseudo-class &quot;clear_list&quot; and pseudo-patterns
&quot;banned&quot;, &quot;caution&quot;,
&quot;harmless&quot;, or &quot;all&quot;, the lists may be
made empty. <br>
E.g.: -drive_class clear_list banned <br>
One will normally define the -drive_class lists in one of
the xorriso Startup Files. <br>
Note: This is not a security feature but rather a bumper for
the superuser to prevent inadverted mishaps. For reliably
blocking access to a device file you have to deny <br>
its rw-permissions in the filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-read_fs
&quot;any&quot;|&quot;norock&quot;|&quot;nojoliet&quot;|&quot;ecma119&quot;
<br>
Specify which kind of filesystem tree to load if present. If
the wish cannot be fulfilled, then ECMA-119 names are loaded
and converted according to -ecma119_map. <br>
&quot;any&quot; first tries to read Rock Ridge. If not
present, Joliet is tried. <br>
&quot;norock&quot; does not try Rock Ridge. <br>
&quot;nojoliet&quot; does not try Joliet. <br>
&quot;ecma119&quot; tries neither Rock Ridge nor Joliet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-assert_volid pattern severity
<br>
Refuse to load ISO images with volume IDs which do not match
the given search pattern. When refusing an image, give up
the input drive and issue an event of the given <br>
severity (like FAILURE, see -abort_on). An empty search
pattern accepts any image. <br>
This command does not hamper the creation of an empty image
from blank input media and does not discard an already
loaded image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-in_charset character_set_name
<br>
Set the character set from which to convert file names when
loading an image. See paragraph &quot;Character sets&quot;
for more explanations. When loading the written image after
<br>
-commit the setting of -out_charset will be copied to
-in_charset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-auto_charset
&quot;on&quot;|&quot;off&quot; <br>
Enable or disable recording and interpretation of the output
character set name in an xattr attribute of the image root
directory. If enabled and if a recorded character <br>
set name is found, then this name will be used as name of
the input character set when reading an image. <br>
Note that the default output charset is the local character
set of the terminal where xorriso runs. Before attributing
this local character set to the produced ISO image, <br>
check whether the terminal properly displays all intended
filenames, especially exotic national characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-hardlinks mode[:mode...] <br>
Enable or disable loading and recording of hardlink
relations. <br>
In default mode &quot;off&quot;, iso_rr files lose their
inode numbers at image load time. Each iso_rr file object
which has no inode number at image generation time will get
a new <br>
unique inode number if -compliance is set to new_rr. <br>
Mode &quot;on&quot; preserves inode numbers from the loaded
image if such numbers were recorded. When committing a
session it searches for families of iso_rr files which stem
from <br>
the same disk file, have identical content filtering and
have identical properties. The family members all get the
same inode number. Whether these numbers are respected <br>
at mount time depends on the operating system. <br>
Command -lsl displays hardlink counts if
&quot;lsl_count&quot; is enabled. This can slow down the
command substantially after changes to the ISO image have
been made. Therefore the <br>
default is &quot;no_lsl_count&quot;. <br>
Commands -update and -update_r track splits and fusions of
hard links in filesystems which have stable device and inode
numbers. This can cause automatic last minute <br>
changes before the session gets written. Command -hardlinks
&quot;perform_update&quot; may be used to do these changes
earlier, e.g. if you need to apply filters to all updated
<br>
files. <br>
Mode &quot;without_update&quot; avoids hardlink processing
during update commands. Use this if your filesystem
situation does not allow -disk_dev_ino &quot;on&quot;. <br>
xorriso commands which extract files from an ISO image try
to hardlink files with identical inode number. The normal
scope of this operation is from image load to image <br>
load. One may give up the accumulated hard link addresses by
-hardlinks &quot;discard_extract&quot;. <br>
A large number of hardlink families may exhaust
-temp_mem_limit if not -osirrox &quot;sort_lba_on&quot; and
-hardlinks &quot;cheap_sorted_extract&quot; are both in
effect. This restricts hard <br>
linking to other files restored by the same single extract
command. -hardlinks &quot;normal_extract&quot; re-enables
wide and expensive hardlink accumulation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-acl
&quot;on&quot;|&quot;off&quot; <br>
Enable or disable processing of ACLs. If enabled, then
xorriso will obtain ACLs from disk file objects, store ACLs
in the ISO image using the libisofs specific AAIP <br>
format, load AAIP data from ISO images, test ACL during file
comparison, and restore ACLs to disk files when extracting
them from ISO images. See also commands -getfacl, <br>
-setfacl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-xattr
&quot;on&quot;|&quot;off&quot; <br>
Enable or disable processing of xattr attributes in user
namespace. If enabled, then xorriso will handle xattr
similar to ACL. See also commands -getfattr, -setfattr and
<br>
above paragraph about xattr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-md5
&quot;on&quot;|&quot;all&quot;|&quot;off&quot;|&quot;load_check_off&quot;
<br>
Enable or disable processing of MD5 checksums for the
overall session and for each single data file. If enabled
then images with checksum tags get loaded only if the tags
<br>
of superblock and directory tree match properly. The MD5
checksums of data files and whole session get loaded from
the image if there are any. <br>
With commands -compare and -update the recorded MD5 of a
file will be used to avoid content reading from the image.
Only the disk file content will be read and compared <br>
with that MD5. This can save much time if -disk_dev_ino
&quot;on&quot; is not suitable. <br>
At image generation time they are computed for each file
which gets its data written into the new session. The
checksums of files which have their data in older sessions
<br>
get copied into the new session. Superblock, tree and whole
session get a checksum tag each. <br>
Mode &quot;all&quot; will additionally check during image
generation whether the checksum of a data file changed
between the time when its reading began and the time when it
ended. <br>
This implies reading every file twice. <br>
Mode &quot;load_check_off&quot; together with &quot;on&quot;
or &quot;all&quot; will load recorded MD5 sums but not test
the recorded checksum tags of superblock and directory tree.
This is necessary <br>
if growisofs was used as burn program, because it does not
overwrite the superblock checksum tag of the first session.
Therefore load_check_off is in effect when xorriso <br>
-as mkisofs option -M is performed. <br>
The test can be re-enabled by mode
&quot;load_check_on&quot;. <br>
Checksums can be exploited via commands -check_md5,
-check_md5_r, via find actions get_md5, check_md5, and via
-check_media.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-for_backup <br>
Enable all extra features which help to produce or to
restore backups with highest fidelity of file properties.
Currently this is a shortcut for: -hardlinks on -acl on <br>
-xattr on -md5 on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ecma119_map
&quot;stripped&quot;|&quot;unmapped&quot;|&quot;lowercase&quot;|&quot;uppercase&quot;
<br>
Choose the conversion of file names from the loaded session
if neither a Rock Ridge name nor a Joliet name was read from
the session. <br>
Mode &quot;stripped&quot; is the default. It shows the names
as found in the ISO but removes trailing &quot;;1&quot; or
&quot;.;1&quot; if present. <br>
Mode &quot;unmapped&quot; shows names as found without
removing characters. <br>
Mode &quot;lowercase&quot; is like &quot;stripped&quot; but
also maps uppercase letters to lowercase letters. This is
compatible to default GNU/Linux mount behavior. <br>
Mode &quot;uppercase&quot; is like &quot;stripped&quot; but
maps lowercase letters to uppercase, if any occur despite
the prescriptions of ECMA-119.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-disk_dev_ino
&quot;on&quot;|&quot;ino_only&quot;|&quot;off&quot; <br>
Enable or disable processing of recorded file identification
numbers (dev_t and ino_t). If enabled they are stored as
xattr and can substantially accelerate file <br>
comparison. The root node gets a global start timestamp. If
during comparison a file with younger timestamps is found in
the ISO image, then it is suspected to have <br>
inconsistent content. <br>
If device numbers and inode numbers of the disk filesystems
are persistent and if no irregular alterations of timestamps
or system clock happen, then potential content <br>
changes can be detected without reading that content. File
content change is assumed if any of mtime, ctime, device
number or inode number have changed. <br>
Mode &quot;ino_only&quot; replaces the precondition that
device numbers are stable by the precondition that mount
points in the compared tree always lead to the same
filesystems. <br>
Use this if mode &quot;on&quot; always sees all files
changed. <br>
The speed advantage appears only if the loaded session was
produced with -disk_dev_ino &quot;on&quot; too. <br>
Note that -disk_dev_ino &quot;off&quot; is totally in effect
only if -hardlinks is &quot;off&quot;, too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-file_name_limit [+]number <br>
Set the maximum permissible length for file names in the
range of 64 to 255. Path components which are longer than
the given number will get truncated and have their last <br>
33 bytes overwritten by a colon &rsquo;:&rsquo; and the hex
representation of the MD5 of the first 4095 bytes of the
whole oversized name. Potential incomplete UTF-8 characters
will <br>
get their leading bytes replaced by &rsquo;_&rsquo;. <br>
iso_rr_paths with the long components will still be able to
access the file paths with truncated components. <br>
If -file_name_limit is executed while an ISO tree is
present, the file names in the ISO tree get checked for
existing truncated file names of the current limit and for
<br>
name collisions between newly truncated files and existing
files. In both cases, the setting will be refused with a
SORRY event. <br>
One may lift this ban by prepending the character
&quot;+&quot; to the argument of -file_name_limit. Truncated
filenames may then get truncated again, invalidating their
MD5 part. <br>
Colliding truncated names are made unique, consuming at
least 9 more bytes of the remaining name part. <br>
If writing of xattr is enabled, then the length will be
stored in &quot;isofs.nt&quot; of the root directory. If
reading of xattr is enabled and &quot;isofs.nt&quot; is
found, then the found <br>
length will get into effect if it is smaller than the
current setting of -file_name_limit. <br>
File name patterns will only work if they match the
truncated name. This might change in future. <br>
Files with truncated names get deleted and re-added
unconditionally during -update and -update_r. This might
change in future. <br>
Linux kernels up to at least 4.1 misrepresent names of
length 254 and 255. If you expect such names in or under
disk_paths and plan to mount the ISO by such Linux <br>
kernels, consider to set -file_name_limit 253. Else just
avoid names longer than 253 characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-rom_toc_scan
&quot;on&quot;|&quot;force&quot;|&quot;off&quot;[:&quot;emul_off&quot;][:&quot;emul_wide&quot;]
<br>
Read-only drives do not tell the actual media type but show
any media as ROM (e.g. as DVD-ROM). The session history of
MMC multi-session media might be truncated to first <br>
and last session or even be completely false. (The emulated
history of overwriteable media is not affected by this.)
<br>
To have in case of failure a chance of getting the session
history and especially the address of the last session,
there is a scan for ISO 9660 filesystem headers which <br>
might help but also might yield worse results than the
drive&rsquo;s table of content. At its end it can cause read
attempts to invalid addresses and thus ugly drive behavior.
<br>
Setting &quot;on&quot; enables that scan for alleged
read-only media. <br>
Some operating systems are not able to mount the most recent
session of multi-session DVD or BD. If on such a system
xorriso has no own MMC capabilities then it may still <br>
find that session from a scanned table of content. Setting
&quot;force&quot; handles any media like a ROM medium with
setting &quot;on&quot;. <br>
On the other hand the emulation of session history on
overwriteable media can hamper reading of partly damaged
media. Setting &quot;off:emul_off&quot; disables the
elsewise <br>
trustworthy table-of-content scan for those media. <br>
The table-of-content scan on overwriteable media normally
searches only up to the end of the session that is pointed
to by the superblock at block 0. Setting <br>
&quot;on:emul_wide&quot; lets the scan continue up to the
end of the medium. This may be useful after copying a medium
with -check_media patch_lba0=on when not the last session
was <br>
loaded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-calm_drive
&quot;in&quot;|&quot;out&quot;|&quot;all&quot;|&quot;revoke&quot;|&quot;on&quot;|&quot;off&quot;
<br>
Reduce drive noise until it is actually used again. Some
drives stay alert for substantial time after they have been
used for reading. This reduces the startup time for <br>
the next drive operation but can be loud and waste energy if
no i/o with the drive is expected to happen soon. <br>
Modes &quot;in&quot;, &quot;out&quot;, &quot;all&quot;
immediately calm down -indev, -outdev, or both,
respectively. Mode &quot;revoke&quot; immediately alerts
both. Mode &quot;on&quot; causes -calm_drive to be <br>
performed automatically after each -dev, -indev, and
-outdev. Mode &quot;off&quot; disables this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ban_stdio_write <br>
Allow for writing only the usage of MMC optical drives.
Disallow to write the result into files of nearly arbitrary
type. Once set, this command cannot be revoked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-early_stdio_test
&quot;on&quot;|&quot;appendable_wo&quot;|&quot;off&quot;
<br>
If enabled by &quot;on&quot; then regular files and block
devices get tested for effective access permissions. This
implies to try opening those files for writing, which
otherwise <br>
will happen only later and only if actual writing is
desired. <br>
The test result is used for classifying the pseudo drives as
overwriteable, read-only, write-only, or uselessly empty.
This may lead to earlier detection of severe <br>
problems, and may avoid some less severe error events. <br>
Mode &quot;appendable_wo&quot; is like &quot;on&quot; with
the additional property that non-empty write-only files are
regarded as appendable rather than blank.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-data_cache_size number_of_tiles
blocks_per_tile <br>
Set the size and granularity of the data cache which is used
when ISO images are loaded and when file content is read
from ISO images. The cache consists of several tiles, <br>
which each consists of several blocks. A larger cache
reduces the need for tiles being read multiple times. Larger
tiles might additionally improve the data throughput <br>
from the drive, but can be wasteful if the data are
scattered over the medium. <br>
Larger cache sizes help best with image loading from MMC
drives. They are an inferior alternative to -osirrox option
&quot;sort_lba_on&quot;. <br>
blocks_per_tile must be a power of 2. E.g. 16, 32, or 64.
The overall cache size must not exceed 1 GiB. The default
values can be restored by parameter &quot;default&quot;
instead <br>
of one or both of the numbers. Currently the default is 32
tiles of 32 blocks = 2 MiB.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Inserting files into ISO
image:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following commands expect
file addresses of two kinds: <br>
disk_path is a path to an object in the local filesystem
tree. <br>
iso_rr_path is the Rock Ridge name of a file object in the
ISO image. If no Rock Ridge information is recorded in the
loaded ISO image, then you will see ISO 9660 names which
<br>
are of limited length and character set. If no Rock Ridge
information shall be stored in an emerging ISO image, then
their names will get mapped to such restricted ISO 9660 (aka
<br>

be in effect with the read-only mounted image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the iso_rr_path of a newly
inserted file leads to an existing file object in the ISO
image, then the following collision handling happens: <br>
If both objects are directories then they get merged by
recursively inserting the subobjects from filesystem into
ISO image. If other file types collide then the setting of
<br>
command -overwrite decides. <br>
Renaming of files has similar collision handling, but
directories can only be replaced, not merged. Note that if
the target directory exists, then -mv inserts the source
objects <br>
into this directory rather than attempting to replace it.
Command -move, on the other hand, would attempt to replace
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The commands in this section
alter the ISO image and not the local filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-disk_pattern
&quot;on&quot;|&quot;ls&quot;|&quot;off&quot; <br>
Set the pattern expansion mode for the disk_path parameters
of several commands which support this feature. <br>
Setting &quot;off&quot; disables this feature for all
commands which are marked in this man page by
&quot;disk_path [***]&quot; or &quot;disk_pattern
[***]&quot;. <br>
Setting &quot;on&quot; enables it for all those commands.
<br>
Setting &quot;ls&quot; enables it only for those which are
marked by &quot;disk_pattern [***]&quot;. <br>
Default is &quot;ls&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-add pathspec [...] | disk_path
[***] <br>
Insert the given files or directory trees from filesystem
into the ISO image. <br>
If -pathspecs is set to &quot;on&quot; or
&quot;as_mkisofs&quot; then pattern expansion is always
disabled and character &rsquo;=&rsquo; has a special
meaning. It separates the ISO image path from the <br>
disk path: <br>
iso_rr_path=disk_path <br>
Character &rsquo;=&rsquo; in the iso_rr_path must be escaped
by &rsquo;&acute; (i.e. as &quot;=&quot;). <br>
With -pathspecs &quot;on&quot;, the character &rsquo;&acute;
must not be escaped. The character &rsquo;=&rsquo; in the
disk_path must not be escaped. <br>
With -pathspecs &quot;as_mkisofs&quot;, all characters
&rsquo;&acute; must be escaped in both, iso_rr_path and
disk_path. The character &rsquo;=&rsquo; may or may not be
escaped in the disk_path. <br>
If iso_rr_path does not begin with &rsquo;/&rsquo; then -cd
is prepended. If disk_path does not begin with
&rsquo;/&rsquo; then -cdx is prepended. <br>
If no &rsquo;=&rsquo; is given then the word is used as
both, iso_rr_path and disk path. If in this case the word
does not begin with &rsquo;/&rsquo; then -cdx is prepended
to the disk_path and <br>
-cd is prepended to the iso_rr_path. <br>
If -pathspecs is set to &quot;off&quot; then -disk_pattern
expansion applies, if enabled. The resulting words are used
as both, iso_rr_path and disk path. Relative path words get
<br>
prepended the setting of -cdx to disk_path and the setting
of -cd to iso_rr_path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-add_plainly mode <br>
If set to mode &quot;unknown&quot; then any command word
that does not begin with &quot;-&quot; and is not recognized
as known command will be subject to a virtual -add command.
I.e. it will <br>
be used as pathspec or as disk_path and added to the image.
If enabled, -disk_pattern expansion applies to disk_paths.
<br>
Mode &quot;dashed&quot; is similar to &quot;unknown&quot;
but also adds unrecognized command words even if they begin
with &quot;-&quot;. <br>
Mode &quot;any&quot; announces that all further words are to
be added as pathspecs or disk_paths. This does not work in
dialog mode. <br>
Mode &quot;none&quot; is the default. It prevents any words
from being understood as files to add, if they are not
parameters to appropriate commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-path_list disk_path <br>
Like -add but read the parameter words from file disk_path
or standard input if disk_path is &quot;-&quot;. The list
must contain exactly one pathspec or disk_path pattern per
<br>
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-quoted_path_list disk_path <br>
Like -path_list but with quoted input reading rules. Lines
get split into parameter words for -add. Whitespace outside
quotes is discarded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-map disk_path iso_rr_path <br>
Insert file object disk_path into the ISO image as
iso_rr_path. If disk_path is a directory then its whole sub
tree is inserted into the ISO image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-map_single disk_path
iso_rr_path <br>
Like -map, but if disk_path is a directory then its sub tree
is not inserted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-map_l disk_prefix iso_rr_prefix
disk_path [***] <br>
Perform -map with each of the disk_path parameters.
iso_rr_path will be composed from disk_path by replacing
disk_prefix by iso_rr_prefix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-update disk_path iso_rr_path
<br>
Compare file object disk_path with file object iso_rr_path.
If they do not match, then perform the necessary image
manipulations to make iso_rr_path a matching copy of <br>
disk_path. By default this comparison will imply lengthy
content reading before a decision is made. Commands
-disk_dev_ino or -md5 may accelerate comparison if they were
<br>
already in effect when the loaded session was recorded. <br>
If disk_path is a directory and iso_rr_path does not exist
yet, then the whole subtree will be inserted. Else only
directory attributes will be updated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-update_r disk_path iso_rr_path
<br>
Like -update but working recursively. I.e. all file objects
below both addresses get compared whether they have
counterparts below the other address and whether both <br>
counterparts match. If there is a mismatch then the
necessary update manipulation is done. <br>
Note that the comparison result may depend on command
-follow. Its setting should always be the same as with the
first adding of disk_path as iso_rr_path. <br>
If iso_rr_path does not exist yet, then it gets added. If
disk_path does not exist, then iso_rr_path gets deleted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-update_l disk_prefix
iso_rr_prefix disk_path [***] <br>
Perform -update_r with each of the disk_path parameters.
iso_rr_path will be composed from disk_path by replacing
disk_prefix by iso_rr_prefix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-cut_out disk_path byte_offset
byte_count iso_rr_path <br>
Map a byte interval of a regular disk file into a regular
file in the ISO image. This may be necessary if the disk
file is larger than a single medium, or if it exceeds <br>
the traditional limit of 2 GiB - 1 for old operating
systems, or the limit of 4 GiB - 1 for newer ones. Only the
newest Linux kernels seem to read properly files &gt;= 4 GiB
<br>
- 1. <br>
A clumsy remedy for this limit is to backup file pieces and
to concatenate them at restore time. A well tested chopping
size is 2047m. It is permissible to request a <br>
higher byte_count than available. The resulting file will be
truncated to the correct size of a final piece. To request a
byte_offset higher than available yields no file <br>
in the ISO image but a SORRY event. E.g: <br>
-cut_out /my/disk/file 0 2047m
/file/part_1_of_3_at_0_with_2047m_of_5753194821 -cut_out
/my/disk/file 2047m 2047m
/file/part_2_of_3_at_2047m_with_2047m_of_5753194821 -cut_out
/my/disk/file 4094m 2047m
/file/part_3_of_3_at_4094m_with_2047m_of_5753194821 <br>
While command -split_size is set larger than 0, and if all
pieces of a file reside in the same ISO directory with no
other files, and if the names look like above, then <br>
their ISO directory will be recognized and handled like a
regular file. This affects commands -compare*, -update*, and
overwrite situations. See command -split_size for <br>
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-cpr disk_path [***] iso_rr_path
<br>
Insert the given files or directory trees from filesystem
into the ISO image. <br>
The rules for generating the ISO addresses are similar as
with shell command cp -r. Nevertheless, directories of the
iso_rr_path are created if necessary. Especially a not <br>
yet existing iso_rr_path will be handled as directory if
multiple disk_paths are present. The leafnames of the
multiple disk_paths will be grafted under that directory as
<br>
would be done with an existing directory. <br>
If a single disk_path is present then a non-existing
iso_rr_path will get the same type as the disk_path. <br>
If a disk_path does not begin with &rsquo;/&rsquo; then -cdx
is prepended. If the iso_rr_path does not begin with
&rsquo;/&rsquo; then -cd is prepended.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mkdir iso_rr_path [...] <br>
Create empty directories if they do not exist yet. Existence
as directory generates a WARNING event, existence as other
file causes a FAILURE event.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-lns target_text iso_rr_path
<br>
Create a symbolic link with address iso_rr_path which points
to target_text. iso_rr_path may not exist yet. <br>
Hint: Command -clone produces the ISO equivalent of a hard
link.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-clone iso_rr_path_original
iso_rr_path_copy <br>
Create a copy of the ISO file object iso_rr_path_original
with the new address iso_rr_path_copy. If the original is a
directory then copy all files and directories <br>
underneath. If iso_rr_path_original is a boot catalog file,
then it gets not copied but is silently ignored. <br>
The copied ISO file objects have the same attributes. Copied
data files refer to the same content source as their
originals. The copies may then be manipulated <br>
independendly of their originals. <br>
This command will refuse execution if the address
iso_rr_path_copy already exists in the ISO tree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-cp_clone iso_rr_path_original
[***] iso_rr_path_dest <br>
Create copies of one or more ISO file objects as with
command -clone. In case of collision merge directories with
existing ones, but do not overwrite existing ISO file <br>
objects. <br>
The rules for generating the copy addresses are the same as
with command -cpr (see above) or shell command cp -r. Other
than with -cpr, relative iso_rr_path_original will <br>
get prepended the -cd path and not the -cdx path. Consider
to -mkdir iso_rr_path_dest before -cp_clone so the copy
address does not depend on the number of <br>
iso_rr_path_original parameters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Settings for file insertion:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-file_size_limit value [value
[...]] -- <br>
Set the maximum permissible size for a single data file. The
values get summed up for the actual limit. If the only value
is &quot;off&quot; then the file size is not limited by <br>
xorriso. Default is a limit of 100 extents, 4g -2k each:
<br>
-file_size_limit 400g -200k -- <br>
When mounting ISO 9660 filesystems, old operating systems
can handle only files up to 2g -1 --. Newer ones are good up
to 4g -1 --. You need quite a new Linux kernel to <br>
read correctly the final bytes of a file &gt;= 4g if its
size is not aligned to 2048 byte blocks. <br>
xorriso&rsquo;s own data read capabilities are not affected
by operating system size limits. Such limits apply to
mounting only. Nevertheless, the target filesystem of an
<br>
-extract must be able to take the file size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-not_mgt code[:code[...]] <br>
Control the behavior of the exclusion lists. <br>
Exclusion processing happens before disk_paths get mapped to
the ISO image and before disk files get compared with image
files. The absolute disk path of the source is <br>
matched against the -not_paths list. The leafname of the
disk path is matched against the patterns in the -not_leaf
list. If a match is detected then the disk path will <br>
not be regarded as an existing file and not be added to the
ISO image. <br>
Several codes are defined. The _on/_off settings persist
until they are revoked by their_off/_on counterparts. <br>
&quot;erase&quot; empties the lists which were accumulated
by -not_paths and -not_leaf. <br>
&quot;reset&quot; is like &quot;erase&quot; but also
re-installs default behavior. <br>
&quot;off&quot; disables exclusion processing temporarily
without invalidating the lists and settings. <br>
&quot;on&quot; re-enables exclusion processing. <br>
&quot;param_off&quot; applies exclusion processing only to
paths below disk_path parameter of commands. I.e. explicitly
given disk_paths are exempted from exclusion processing.
<br>
&quot;param_on&quot; applies exclusion processing to command
parameters as well as to files below such parameters. <br>
&quot;subtree_off&quot; with &quot;param_on&quot; excludes
parameter paths only if they match a -not_paths item
exactly. <br>
&quot;subtree_on&quot; additionally excludes parameter paths
which lead to a file address below any -not_paths item. <br>
&quot;ignore_off&quot; treats excluded disk files as if they
were missing. I.e. they get reported with -compare and
deleted from the image with -update. <br>
&quot;ignore_on&quot; keeps excluded files out of -compare
or -update activities.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-not_paths disk_path [***] <br>
Add the given paths to the list of excluded absolute disk
paths. If a given path is relative, then the current -cdx is
prepended to form an absolute path. Pattern <br>
matching, if enabled, happens at definition time and not
when exclusion checks are made. <br>
(Do not forget to end the list of disk_paths by
&quot;--&quot;)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-not_leaf pattern <br>
Add a single shell parser style pattern to the list of
exclusions for disk leafnames. These patterns are evaluated
when the exclusion checks are made.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-not_list disk_path <br>
Read lines from disk_path and use each of them either as
-not_paths parameter, if they contain a / character, or as
-not_leaf pattern.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-quoted_not_list disk_path <br>
Like -not_list but with quoted input reading rules. Each
word is handled as one parameter for -not_paths or
-not_leaf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-follow occasion[:occasion[...]]
<br>
Enable or disable resolution of symbolic links and
mountpoints under disk_paths. This applies to actions -add,
-du*x, -ls*x, -findx, -concat, and to -disk_pattern <br>
expansion. <br>
There are three kinds of follow decisison to be made: <br>
link is the hop from a symbolic link to its target file
object for the purpose of reading. I.e. not for command
-concat. If enabled then symbolic links are handled as <br>
their target file objects, else symbolic links are handled
as themselves. <br>
mount is the hop from one filesystem to another subordinate
filesystem. If enabled then mountpoint directories are
handled as any other directory, else mountpoints are <br>
handled as empty directories if they are encountered in
directory tree traversals. <br>
concat is the hop from a symbolic link to its target file
object for the purpose of writing. I.e. for command -concat.
This is a security risk ! <br>
Less general than above occasions: <br>
pattern is mount and link hopping, but only during
-disk_pattern expansion. <br>
param is link hopping for parameter words (after eventual
pattern expansion). If enabled then -ls*x will show the link
targets rather than the links themselves. -du*x, <br>
-findx, and -add will process the link targets but not
follow links in an eventual directory tree below the targets
(unless &quot;link&quot; is enabled). <br>
Occasions can be combined in a colon separated list. All
occasions mentioned in the list will then lead to a positive
follow decision. <br>
off prevents any positive follow decision. Use it if no
other occasion applies. <br>
Shortcuts: <br>
default is equivalent to
&quot;pattern:mount:limit=100&quot;. <br>
on always decides positive. Equivalent to
&quot;link:mount:concat&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Not an occasion but an optional
setting is: <br>
limit=&lt;number&gt; which sets the maximum number of link
hops. A link hop consists of a sequence of symbolic links
and a final target of different type. Nevertheless those
<br>
hops can loop. Example: <br>
$ ln -s .. uploop <br>
Link hopping has a built-in loop detection which stops
hopping at the first repetition of a link target. Then the
repeated link is handled as itself and not as its target.
<br>
Regrettably one can construct link networks which cause
exponential workload before their loops get detected. The
number given with &quot;limit=&quot; can curb this workload
at the <br>
risk of truncating an intentional sequence of link hops.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pathspecs
&quot;on&quot;|&quot;off&quot;|&quot;as_mkisofs&quot; <br>
Control parameter interpretation with xorriso actions -add
and -path_list. <br>
Mode &quot;as_mkisofs&quot; enables pathspecs of the form
<br>
iso_rr_path=disk_path <br>
like with program mkisofs -graft-points. <br>
All characters &rsquo;&acute; must be escaped in both,
iso_rr_path and disk_path. The character &rsquo;=&rsquo;
must be escaped in the iso_rr_path and may or may not be
escaped in the <br>
disk_path. This mode temporarily disables -disk_pattern
expansion for command -add. <br>
Mode &quot;on&quot; does nearly the same. But
&rsquo;=&rsquo; must only be escaped in the iso_rr_path and
&rsquo;&acute; must not be escaped at all. This has the
disadvantage that one cannot express an <br>
iso_rr_path which ends by &rsquo;&acute;. <br>
Mode &quot;off&quot; disables pathspecs of the form
target=source and re-enables -disk_pattern expansion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-overwrite
&quot;on&quot;|&quot;nondir&quot;|&quot;off&quot; <br>
Allow or disallow overwriting of existing files in the ISO
image by files with the same name. <br>
With setting &quot;off&quot;, name collisions cause FAILURE
events. With setting &quot;nondir&quot;, only directories
are protected by such events, other existing file types get
treated with <br>
-rm before the new file gets added. Setting &quot;on&quot;
enables automatic -rm_r. I.e. a non-directory can replace an
existing directory and all its subordinates. <br>
If restoring of files is enabled, then the overwrite rule
applies to the target file objects on disk as well, but
&quot;on&quot; is downgraded to &quot;nondir&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-split_size
number[&quot;k&quot;|&quot;m&quot;] <br>
Set the threshold for automatic splitting of regular files.
Such splitting maps a large disk file onto a ISO directory
with several part files in it. This is necessary if <br>
the size of the disk file exceeds -file_size_limit. Older
operating systems can handle files in mounted ISO 9660
filesystems only if they are smaller than 2 GiB or in <br>
other cases 4 GiB. <br>
Default is 0 which will exclude files larger than
-file_size_limit by a FAILURE event. A well tested
-split_size is 2047m. Sizes above -file_size_limit are not
<br>
permissible. <br>
While command -split_size is set larger than 0 such a
directory with split file pieces will be recognized and
handled like a regular file by commands -compare* ,
-update*, <br>
and in overwrite situations. There are -ossirox parameters
&quot;concat_split_on&quot; and &quot;concat_split_off&quot;
which control the handling when files get restored to disk.
<br>
In order to be recognizable, the names of the part files
have to describe the splitting by 5 numbers: <br>

part_number,total_parts,byte_offset,byte_count,disk_file_size
<br>
which are embedded in the following text form: <br>
part_#_of_#_at_#_with_#_of_# <br>
Scaling characters like &quot;m&quot; or &quot;k&quot; are
taken into respect. All digits are interpreted as decimal,
even if leading zeros are present. <br>
E.g: /file/part_1_of_3_at_0_with_2047m_of_5753194821 <br>
No other files are allowed in the directory. All parts have
to be present and their numbers have to be plausible. E.g.
byte_count must be valid as -cut_out parameter and <br>
their contents may not overlap.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File manipulations:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following commands
manipulate files in the ISO image, regardless whether they
stem from the loaded image or were newly inserted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-iso_rr_pattern
&quot;on&quot;|&quot;ls&quot;|&quot;off&quot; <br>
Set the pattern expansion mode for the iso_rr_path
parameters of several commands which support this feature.
<br>
Setting &quot;off&quot; disables pattern expansion for all
commands which are marked in this man page by
&quot;iso_rr_path [***]&quot; or &quot;iso_rr_pattern
[***]&quot;. <br>
Setting &quot;on&quot; enables it for all those commands.
<br>
Setting &quot;ls&quot; enables it only for those which are
marked by &quot;iso_rr_pattern [***]&quot;. <br>
Default is &quot;on&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-rm iso_rr_path [***] <br>
Delete the given files from the ISO image. <br>
Note: This does not free any space on the -indev medium,
even if the deletion is committed to that same medium. <br>
The image size will shrink if the image is written to a
different medium in modification mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-rm_r iso_rr_path [***] <br>
Delete the given files or directory trees from the ISO
image. See also the note with command -rm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-rmdir iso_rr_path [***] <br>
Delete empty directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-move iso_rr_path iso_rr_path
<br>
Rename the file given by the first (origin) iso_rr_path to
the second (destination) iso_rr_path. Deviate from rules of
shell command mv by not moving the origin file <br>
underneath an existing destination directory. The origin
file will rather replace such a directory, if this is
allowed by command -overwrite.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mv iso_rr_path [***]
iso_rr_path <br>
Rename the given file objects in the ISO tree to the last
parameter in the list. Use the same rules as with shell
command mv. <br>
If pattern expansion is enabled and if the last parameter
contains wildcard characters then it must match exactly one
existing file address, or else the command fails with <br>
a FAILURE event.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-chown uid iso_rr_path [***]
<br>
Set ownership of file objects in the ISO image. uid may
either be a decimal number or the name of a user known to
the operating system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-chown_r uid iso_rr_path [***]
<br>
Like -chown but affecting all files below eventual
directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-chgrp gid iso_rr_path [***]
<br>
Set group attribute of file objects in the ISO image. gid
may either be a decimal number or the name of a group known
to the operating system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-chgrp_r gid iso_rr_path [***]
<br>
Like -chgrp but affecting all files below eventual
directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-chmod mode iso_rr_path [***]
<br>
Equivalent to shell command chmod in the ISO image. mode is
either an octal number beginning with &quot;0&quot; or a
comma separated list of statements of the form <br>
[ugoa]*[+-=][rwxst]* . <br>
Like: go-rwx,u+rwx . <br>
Personalities: u=user, g=group, o=others, a=all <br>
Operators: + adds given permissions, - revokes given
permissions, = revokes all old permissions and then adds the
given ones. <br>
Permissions: r=read, w=write, x=execute|inspect,
s=setuid|setgid, t=sticky bit <br>
For octal numbers see man 2 stat.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-chmod_r mode iso_rr_path [***]
<br>
Like -chmod but affecting all files below eventual
directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-setfacl acl_text iso_rr_path
[***] <br>
Attach the given ACL to the given iso_rr_paths. If the files
already have ACLs, then those get deleted before the new
ones get into effect. If acl_text is empty, or <br>
contains the text &quot;clear&quot; or the text
&quot;--remove-all&quot;, then the existing ACLs will be
removed and no new ones will be attached. Any other content
of acl_text will be <br>
interpreted as a list of ACL entries. It may be in the long
multi-line format as put out by -getfacl but may also be
abbreviated as follows: <br>
ACL entries are separated by comma or newline. If an entry
is empty text or begins with &quot;#&quot; then it will be
ignored. A valid entry has to begin by a letter out of
{ugom} <br>
for &quot;user&quot;, &quot;group&quot;, &quot;other&quot;,
&quot;mask&quot;. It has to contain two colons
&quot;:&quot;. A non-empty text between those &quot;:&quot;
gives a user id or group id. After the second &quot;:&quot;
there may be <br>
letters out of {rwx- #}. The first three give read, write,
or execute permission. Letters &quot;-&quot;, &quot; &quot;
and TAB are ignored. &quot;#&quot; causes the rest of the
entry to be ignored. <br>
Letter &quot;X&quot; or any other letters are not supported.
Examples: <br>
g:toolies:rw,u:lisa:rw,u:1001:rw,u::wr,g::r,o::r,m::rw <br>
group:toolies:rw-,user::rw-,group::r--,other::r--,mask::rw-
<br>
A valid entry may be prefixed by &quot;d&quot;, some
following characters and &quot;:&quot;. This indicates that
the entry goes to the &quot;default&quot; ACL rather than to
the &quot;access&quot; ACL. Example: <br>

u::rwx,g::rx,o::,d:u::rwx,d:g::rx,d:o::,d:u:lisa:rwx,d:m::rwx</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-setfacl_r acl_text iso_rr_path
[***] <br>
Like -setfacl but affecting all files below eventual

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-setfacl_list disk_path <br>
Read the output of -getfacl_r or shell command getfacl -R
and apply it to the iso_rr_paths as given in lines beginning
with &quot;# file:&quot;. This will change ownership, group
<br>
and ACL of the given files. If disk_path is &quot;-&quot;
then lines are read from standard input. Line &quot;@&quot;
ends the list, &quot;@@@&quot; aborts without changing the
pending iso_rr_path. <br>
Since -getfacl and getfacl -R strip leading &quot;/&quot;
from file paths, the setting of -cd does always matter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-setfattr [-]name value
iso_rr_path [***] <br>
Attach the given xattr pair of name and value to the given
iso_rr_paths. If the given name is prefixed by
&quot;-&quot;, then the pair with that name gets removed
from the xattr <br>
list. If name is &quot;--remove-all&quot; then all user
namespace xattr of the given iso_rr_paths get deleted. In
case of deletion, value must be an empty text. <br>
Only names from the user namespace are allowed. I.e. a name
has to begin with &quot;user.&quot;, like &quot;user.x&quot;
or &quot;user.whatever&quot;. <br>
Values and names undergo the normal input processing of
xorriso. See also command -backslash_codes. Other than with
command -setfattr_list, the byte value 0 cannot be <br>
expressed via -setfattr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-setfattr_r [-]name value
iso_rr_path [***] <br>
Like -setfattr but affecting all files below eventual
directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-setfattr_list disk_path <br>
Read the output of -getfattr_r or shell command getfattr -Rd
and apply it to the iso_rr_paths as given in lines beginning
with &quot;# file:&quot;. All previously existing user <br>
space xattr of the given iso_rr_paths will be deleted. If
disk_path is &quot;-&quot; then lines are read from standard
input. <br>
Since -getfattr and getfattr -Rd strip leading &quot;/&quot;
from file paths, the setting of -cd does always matter. <br>
Empty input lines and lines which begin by &quot;#&quot;
will be ignored (except &quot;# file:&quot;). Line
&quot;@&quot; ends the list, &quot;@@@&quot; aborts without
changing the pending iso_rr_path. Other <br>
input lines must have the form <br>
name=&quot;value&quot; <br>
Name must be from user namespace. I.e. user.xyz where xyz
should consist of printable characters only. The separator
&quot;=&quot; is not allowed in names. Value may contain any
<br>
kind of bytes. It must be in quotes. Trailing whitespace
after the end quote will be ignored. Non-printables bytes
and quotes must be represented as <br>
8-bit code XYZ. Use code 00 for 0-bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-alter_date type timestring
iso_rr_path [***] <br>
Alter the date entries of files in the ISO image. type may
be one of the following: <br>
&quot;a&quot; sets access time, updates ctime. <br>
&quot;m&quot; sets modification time, updates ctime. <br>
&quot;b&quot; sets access time and modification time,
updates ctime. <br>
&quot;a-c&quot;, &quot;m-c&quot;, and &quot;b-c&quot; set
the times without updating ctime. <br>
&quot;c&quot; sets the ctime. <br>
timestring may be in the following formats (see also section
EXAMPLES): <br>
As expected by program date: <br>
MMDDhhmm[[CC]YY][.ss]] <br>
As produced by program date: <br>
[Day] MMM DD hh:mm:ss [TZON] YYYY <br>
Relative times counted from current clock time: <br>

+|-Number[&quot;s&quot;|&quot;h&quot;|&quot;d&quot;|&quot;w&quot;|&quot;m&quot;|&quot;y&quot;]
<br>
where &quot;s&quot; means seconds, &quot;h&quot; hours,
&quot;d&quot; days, &quot;w&quot; weeks, &quot;m&quot;=30d,
&quot;y&quot;=365.25d plus 1d added to multiplication

etc. <br>
ECMA-119 volume timestamps: <br>
YYYYMMDDhhmmsscc <br>
These are normally given as GMT. The suffix &quot;LOC&quot;
causes local timezone conversion. E.g. 2013010720574700,
2013010720574700LOC. The last two digits cc (centiseconds)
will <br>
be ignored, but must be present in order to make the format
recognizable. <br>
Example: <br>
-alter_date m-c 2013.11.27.103951 /file1 /file2 -- <br>
This command does not persistently apply to the boot
catalog, which gets fresh timestamps at -commit time.
Command -volume_date &quot;uuid&quot; can set this time
value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-alter_date_r type timestring
iso_rr_path [***] <br>
Like -alter_date but affecting all files below eventual
directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-hide hide_state iso_rr_path
[***] <br>
Prevent the names of the given files from showing up in the
directory trees of ISO 9660 and/or Joliet and/or HFS+ when
the image gets written. The data content of such <br>
hidden files will be included in the resulting image, even
if they do not show up in any directory. But you will need
own means to find nameless data in the image. <br>
Warning: Data which are hidden from the ISO 9660 tree will
not be copied by the write method of modifying. <br>
Possible values of hide_state are: &quot;iso_rr&quot; for
hiding from ISO 9660 tree, &quot;joliet&quot; for Joliet
tree, &quot;hfsplus&quot; for HFS+, &quot;on&quot; for them
all. &quot;off&quot; means visibility in all <br>
directory trees. <br>
These values may be combined. E.g.: joliet:hfsplus <br>
This command does not apply to the boot catalog. Rather use:
-boot_image &quot;any&quot; &quot;cat_hidden=on&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tree traversal command
-find:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-find iso_rr_path [test [op]
[test ...]] [-exec action [params]] -- <br>
A restricted substitute for shell command find in the ISO
image. It performs an action on matching file objects at or
below iso_rr_path. <br>
If not used as last command in the line then the parameter
list needs to get terminated by &quot;--&quot;. <br>
Tests are optional. If they are omitted then action is
applied to all file objects. If tests are given then they
form together an expression. The action is applied only <br>
if the expression matches the file object. Default
expression operator between tests is -and, i.e. the
expression matches only if all its tests match. <br>
Available tests are: <br>
-name pattern : Matches if pattern matches the file leaf
name. If the pattern does not contain any of the characters
&quot;*?[&quot;, then it will be truncated according to <br>
-file_name_limit and thus match the truncated name in the
ISO filesystem. <br>
-wholename pattern : Matches if pattern matches the file
path as it would be printed by action &quot;echo&quot;.
Character &rsquo;/&rsquo; can be matched by wildcards. If
pattern pieces between <br>
&rsquo;/&rsquo; do not contain any of the characters
&quot;*?[&quot;, they will be truncated according to
-file_name_limit. <br>
-disk_name pattern : Like -name but testing the leaf name of
the file source on disk. Can match only data files which do
not stem from the loaded image, or for <br>
directories above such data files. With directories the
result can change between -find runs if their content stems
from multiple sources. <br>
-disk_path disk_path : Matches if the given disk_path is
equal to the path of the file source on disk. The same
restrictions apply as with -disk_name. <br>
-type type_letter : Matches files of the given type:
&quot;block&quot;, &quot;char&quot;, &quot;dir&quot;,
&quot;pipe&quot;, &quot;file&quot;, &quot;link&quot;,
&quot;socket&quot;, &quot;eltorito&quot;, and
&quot;Xotic&quot; which matches what is not matched by <br>
the other types. <br>
Only the first letter is interpreted. E.g.: -find / -type d
<br>
-damaged : Matches files which use data blocks marked as
damaged by a previous run of -check_media. The damage info
vanishes when a new ISO image gets loaded. <br>
Note that a MD5 session mismatch marks all files of the
session as damaged. If finer distinction is desired, perform
-md5 off before -check_media. <br>
-pending_data : Matches files which get their content from
outside the loaded ISO image. <br>
-lba_range start_lba block_count : Matches files which use
data blocks within the range of start_lba and
start_lba+block_count-1. <br>
-has_acl : Matches files which have a non-trivial ACL. <br>
-has_xattr : Matches files which have xattr name-value pairs
from user namespace. <br>
-has_aaip : Matches files which have ACL or any xattr. <br>
-has_any_xattr : Matches files which have any xattr other
than ACL. <br>
-has_md5 : Matches data files which have MD5 checksums. <br>
-has_hfs_crtp creator type : Matches files which have the
given HFS+ creator and type attached. These are codes of 4
characters which get stored if -hfsplus is enabled. <br>
Use a single dash &rsquo;-&rsquo; as wildcard that matches
any such code. E.g:. <br>
-has_hfs_crtp YYDN TEXT <br>
-has_hfs_crtp - - <br>
-has_hfs_bless blessing : Matches files which bear the given
HFS+ blessing. It may be one of : &quot;ppc_bootdir&quot;,
&quot;intel_bootfile&quot;, &quot;show_folder&quot;,
&quot;os9_folder&quot;, &quot;osx_folder&quot;, <br>
&quot;any&quot;. See also action set_hfs_bless. <br>
-has_filter : Matches files which are filtered by
-set_filter. <br>
-hidden hide_state : Matches files which are hidden in
&quot;iso_rr&quot; tree, in &quot;joliet&quot; tree, in
&quot;hfsplus&quot; tree, in all trees (&quot;on&quot;), or
not hidden in any tree (&quot;off&quot;). <br>
Those which are hidden in some tree match -not -hidden
&quot;off&quot;. <br>
-bad_outname namespace : Matches files with names which
change when converted forth and back between the local
character set and one of the namespaces
&quot;rockridge&quot;, <br>
&quot;joliet&quot;, &quot;ecma119&quot;,
&quot;hfsplus&quot;. <br>
All applicable -compliance rules are taken into respect.
Rule &quot;omit_version&quot; is always enabled, because
else namespaces &quot;joliet&quot; and &quot;ecma119&quot;
would cause changes with <br>
every non-directory name. Consider to also enable rules
&quot;no_force_dots&quot; and &quot;no_j_force_dots&quot;.
<br>
The namespaces use different character sets and apply
further restrictions to name length, permissible characters,
and mandatory name components. &quot;rockridge&quot; uses
the <br>
character set defined by -out_charset, &quot;joliet&quot;
uses UCS-2BE, &quot;ecma119&quot; uses ASCII,
&quot;hfsplus&quot; uses UTF-16BE. <br>
-name_limit_blocker length : Matches file names which would
prevent command -file_name_limit with the given length. The
command itself reports only the first problem file. <br>
-prune : If this test is reached and the tested file is a
directory then -find will not dive into that directory. This
test itself does always match. <br>
-use_pattern &quot;on&quot;|&quot;off&quot; : This pseudo
test controls the interpretation of wildcards with tests
-name, -wholename, and -disk_name. Default is
&quot;on&quot;. If interpretation is <br>
disabled by &quot;off&quot;, then the parameters of -name,
-wholename, and -disk_name have to match literally rather
than as search pattern. This test itself does always match.
<br>
-or_use_pattern &quot;on&quot;|&quot;off&quot; : Like
-use_pattern, but automatically appending the test by -or
rather than by -and. Further the test itself does never
match. So a subsequent <br>
test -or will cause its other operand to be performed. <br>
-decision &quot;yes&quot;|&quot;no&quot; : If this test is
reached then the evaluation ends immediately and action is
performed if the decision is &quot;yes&quot; or
&quot;true&quot;. See operator -if. <br>
-true and -false : Always match or match not, respectively.
Evaluation goes on. <br>
-sort_lba : Always match. This causes -find to perform its
action in a sequence sorted by the ISO image block addresses
of the files. It may improve throughput with <br>
actions which read data from optical drives. Action will
always get the absolute path as parameter. <br>
Available operators are: <br>
-not : Matches if the next test or sub expression does not
match. Several tests do this specifically: <br>
-undamaged, -lba_range with negative start_lba, -has_no_acl,
-has_no_xattr, -has_no_aaip, -has_no_filter . <br>
-and : Matches if both neighboring tests or expressions
match. <br>
-or : Matches if at least one of both neighboring tests or
expressions matches. <br>
-sub ... -subend or ( ... ) : Enclose a sub expression which
gets evaluated first before it is processed by neighboring
operators. Normal precedence is: -not, -or , -and. <br>
-if ... -then ... -elseif ... -then ... -else ... -endif :
Enclose one or more sub expressions. If the -if expression
matches, then the -then expression is evaluated as <br>
the result of the whole expression up to -endif. Else the
next -elseif expression is evaluated and if it matches, its
-then expression. Finally in case of no match, the <br>
-else expression is evaluated. There may be more than one
-elseif. Neither -else nor -elseif are mandatory. If -else
is missing and would be hit, then the result is a <br>
non-match. <br>
-if-expressions are the main use case for above test
-decision.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default action is echo, i.e. to
print the address of the found file. Other actions are
certain xorriso commands which get performed on the found
files. These commands may <br>
have specific parameters. See also their particular
descriptions. <br>
chown and chown_r change the ownership and get the user id
as parameter. E.g.: -exec chown thomas -- <br>
chgrp and chgrp_r change the group attribute and get the
group id as parameter. E.g.: -exec chgrp_r staff -- <br>
chmod and chmod_r change access permissions and get a mode
string as parameter. E.g.: -exec chmod a-w,a+r -- <br>
alter_date and alter_date_r change the timestamps. They get
a type character and a timestring as parameters. <br>
E.g.: -exec alter_date &quot;m&quot; &quot;Dec 30 19:34:12
2007&quot; -- <br>
set_to_mtime sets the ctime and atime to the value found in
mtime. <br>
lsdl prints file information like shell command ls -dl. <br>
compare performs command -compare with the found file
address as iso_rr_path and the corresponding file address
below its parameter disk_path_start. For this the <br>
iso_rr_path of the -find command gets replaced by the
disk_path_start. <br>
E.g.: -find /thomas -exec compare /home/thomas -- <br>
update performs command -update with the found file address
as iso_rr_path. The corresponding file address is determined
like with above action &quot;compare&quot;. <br>
update_merge is like update but does not delete the found
file if it is missing on disk. It may be run several times
and records with all visited files whether their <br>
counterpart on disk has already been seen by one of the
update_merge runs. Finally, a -find run with action
&quot;rm_merge&quot; may remove all files that saw no
counterpart on <br>
disk. <br>
Up to the next &quot;rm_merge&quot; or
&quot;clear_merge&quot; all newly inserted files will get
marked as having a disk counterpart. <br>
rm removes the found iso_rr_path from the image if it is not
a directory with files in it. I.e. this &quot;rm&quot;
includes &quot;rmdir&quot;. <br>
rm_r removes the found iso_rr_path from the image, including
whole directory trees. <br>
rm_merge removes the found iso_rr_path if it was visited by
one or more previous actions &quot;update_merge&quot; and
saw no counterpart on disk in any of them. The marking from
the <br>
update actions is removed in any case. <br>
clear_merge removes an eventual marking from action
&quot;update_merge&quot;. <br>
report_damage classifies files whether they hit a data block
that is marked as damaged. The result is printed together
with the address of the first damaged byte, the <br>
maximum span of damages, file size, and the path of the
file. <br>
report_lba prints files which are associated to image data
blocks. It tells the logical block address, the block
number, the byte size, and the path of each file. There <br>
may be reported more than one line per file if the file has
more than one section. In this case each line has a
different extent number in column &quot;xt&quot;. <br>
report_sections like report_lba but telling the byte sizes
of the particular sections rather than the overall byte size
of the file. <br>
getfacl prints access permissions in ACL text form to the
result channel. <br>
setfacl attaches ACLs after removing existing ones. The new
ACL is given in text form as defined with command -setfacl.
<br>
E.g.: -exec setfacl u:lisa:rw,u::rw,g::r,o::-,m::rw -- <br>
getfattr prints xattr name-value pairs from user namespace
to the result channel. <br>
get_any_xattr prints xattr name-value pairs from any
namespace except ACL to the result channel. This is mostly
for debugging of namespace &quot;isofs&quot;. <br>
list_extattr mode prints a script to the result channel,
which would use FreeBSD command setextattr to set the
file&rsquo;s xattr name-value pairs of user namespace.
Parameter <br>
mode controls the form of the output of names and values.
Default mode &quot;e&quot; prints harmless characters in
shell quotation marks, but represents texts with octal 001
to 037 <br>
and 0177 to 0377 by an embedded echo -e command. Mode
&quot;q&quot; prints any characters in shell quotation
marks. This might not be terminal-safe but should work in
script files. <br>
Mode &quot;r&quot; uses no quotation marks. Not safe. Mode
&quot;b&quot; prints backslash encoding. Not suitable for
shell parsing. <br>
E.g. -exec list_extattr e -- <br>
Command -backslash_codes does not affect the output. <br>
get_md5 prints the MD5 sum, if recorded, together with file
path. <br>
check_md5 compares the MD5 sum, if recorded, with the file
content and reports if mismatch. <br>
E.g.: -find / -not -pending_data -exec check_md5 FAILURE --
<br>
make_md5 equips a data file with an MD5 sum of its content.
Useful to upgrade the files in the loaded image to full MD5
coverage by the next commit with -md5 &quot;on&quot;. <br>
E.g.: -find / -type f -not -has_md5 -exec make_md5 -- <br>
setfattr sets or deletes xattr name value pairs. <br>
E.g.: -find / -has_xattr -exec setfattr --remove-all
&rsquo;&rsquo; -- <br>
set_hfs_crtp adds, changes, or removes HFS+ creator and type
attributes. <br>
E.g.: -exec set_hfs_crtp YYDN TEXT <br>
E.g.: -find /my/dir -prune -exec set_hfs_crtp --delete -
<br>
get_hfs_crtp prints the HFS+ creator and type attributes
together with the iso_rr_path, if the file has such
attributes at all. <br>
E.g.: -exec get_hfs_crtp <br>
set_hfs_bless applies or removes HFS+ blessings. They are
roles which can be attributed to up to four directories and
a data file: <br>
&quot;ppc_bootdir&quot;, &quot;intel_bootfile&quot;,
&quot;show_folder&quot;, &quot;os9_folder&quot;,
&quot;osx_folder&quot;. <br>
They may be abbreviated as &quot;p&quot;, &quot;i&quot;,
&quot;s&quot;, &quot;9&quot;, and &quot;x&quot;. <br>
Each such role can be attributed to at most one file object.
&quot;intel_bootfile&quot; is the one that would apply to a
data file. All others apply to directories. The -find run
<br>
will end as soon as the first blessing is issued. The
previous bearer of the blessing will lose it then. No file
object can bear more than one blessing. <br>
E.g.: -find /my/blessed/directory -exec set_hfs_bless p <br>
Further there is blessing &quot;none&quot; or &quot;n&quot;
which revokes any blessing from the found files. This -find
run will not stop when the first match is reached. <br>
E.g.: -find / -has_hfs_bless any -exec set_hfs_bless none
<br>
get_hfs_bless prints the HFS+ blessing role and the
iso_rr_path, if the file is blessed at all. <br>
E.g.: -exec get_hfs_bless <br>
set_filter applies or removes filters. <br>
E.g.: -exec set_filter --zisofs -- <br>
mkisofs_r applies the rules of mkisofs -r to the file
object: <br>
user id and group id become 0, all r-permissions get
granted, all w denied. If there is any x-permission, then
all three x get granted. s- and t-bits get removed. <br>
sort_weight attributes a LBA weight number to regular files.
<br>
The number may range from -2147483648 to 2147483647. The
higher it is, the lower will be the block address of the
file data in the emerging ISO image. Currently the boot <br>
catalog has a hardcoded weight of 1 billion. Normally it
should occupy the block with the lowest possible address.
<br>
Data files which are loaded by -indev or -dev get a weight
between 1 and 2 exp 28 = 268,435,456, depending on their
block address. This shall keep them roughly in the same <br>
order if the write method of modifying is applied. <br>
Data files which are added by other commands get an initial
weight of 0. Boot image files have a default weight of 2.
<br>
E.g.: -exec sort_weight 3 -- <br>
show_stream shows the content stream chain of a data file.
<br>
show_stream_id is like show_stream, but also prints between
stream type and first &quot;:&quot; in square brackets
libisofs id numbers: [fs_id,dev_id,ino_id]. <br>
hide brings the file into one of the hide states
&quot;on&quot;, &quot;iso_rr&quot;, &quot;joliet&quot;,
&quot;hfsplus&quot;, &quot;off&quot;. They may be combined.
E.g.: joliet:hfsplus <br>
E.g.: <br>
-find / -disk_name *_secret -exec hide on <br>
print_outname prints in the first line the filename as
registered by the program model, and in the second line the
filename after conversion forth and back between local <br>
character set and one of the namespaces
&quot;rockridge&quot;, &quot;joliet&quot;,
&quot;ecma119&quot;, or &quot;hfsplus&quot;. The third
output line is &quot;--&quot; . <br>
The name conversion does not take into respect the
possibility of name collisions in the target namespace. Such
collisions are most likely in &quot;joliet&quot; and
&quot;ecma119&quot;, where <br>
they get resolved by automatic file name changes. <br>
E.g.: <br>
-find / -bad_outname joliet -exec print_outname joliet <br>
estimate_size prints a lower and an upper estimation of the
number of blocks which the found files together will occupy
in the emerging ISO image. This does not account <br>
for the superblock, for the directories in the -find path,
or for image padding. <br>
find performs another run of -find on the matching file
address. It accepts the same params as -find, except
iso_rr_path. <br>
E.g.: <br>
-find / -name &rsquo;???&rsquo; -type d -exec find -name
&rsquo;[abc]*&rsquo; -exec chmod a-w,a+r --</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Filters for data file
content:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Filters may be installed between
data files in the ISO image and their content source outside
the image. They may also be used vice versa between data
content in the image and <br>
target files on disk. <br>
Built-in filters are &quot;--zisofs&quot; and
&quot;--zisofs-decode&quot;. The former is to be applied via
-set_filter, the latter is automatically applied if zisofs
compressed content is detected <br>
with a file when loading the ISO image. <br>
Another built-in filter pair is &quot;--gzip&quot; and
&quot;--gunzip&quot; with suffix &quot;.gz&quot;. They
behave about like external gzip and gunzip but avoid forking
a process for each single file. So <br>
they are much faster if there are many small files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-external_filter name
option[:option] program_path [arguments] -- <br>
Register a content filter by associating a name with a
program path, program arguments, and some behavioral
options. Once registered it can be applied to multiple data
<br>
files in the ISO image, regardless whether their content
resides in the loaded ISO image or in the local filesystem.
External filter processes may produce synthetic file <br>
content by reading the original content from stdin and
writing to stdout whatever they want. They must deliver the
same output on the same input in repeated runs. <br>
Options are: <br>
&quot;default&quot; means that no other option is intended.
<br>
&quot;suffix=...&quot; sets a file name suffix. If it is not
empty then it will be appended to the file name or removed
from it. <br>
&quot;remove_suffix&quot; will remove a file name suffix
rather than appending it. <br>
&quot;if_nonempty&quot; will leave 0-sized files unfiltered.
<br>
&quot;if_reduction&quot; will try filtering and revoke it if
the content size does not shrink. <br>
&quot;if_block_reduction&quot; will revoke if the number of
2 kB blocks does not shrink. <br>
&quot;used=...&quot; is ignored. Command -status shows it
with the number of files which currently have the filter
applied. <br>
Examples: <br>
-external_filter bzip2 suffix=.bz2:if_block_reduction
/usr/bin/bzip2 -- <br>
-external_filter bunzip2 suffix=.bz2:remove_suffix
/usr/bin/bunzip2 --</p>

Irrevocably ban commands -concat &quot;pipe&quot;,
-external_filter, and -unregister_filter, but not
-set_filter. Use this to prevent external filtering in
general or when all <br>
intended filters are registered and -concat mode
&quot;pipe&quot; shall be disallowed. External filters may
also be banned totally at compile time of xorriso. By
default they are <br>
banned if xorriso runs under setuid permission.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-set_filter name iso_rr_path
[***] <br>
Apply an -external_filter or a built-in filter to the given
data files in the ISO image. If the filter suffix is not
empty , then it will be applied to the file name. <br>
Renaming only happens if the filter really gets attached and
is not revoked by its options. By default files which
already bear the suffix will not get filtered. The <br>
others will get the suffix appended to their names. If the
filter has option &quot;remove_suffix&quot;, then the filter
will only be applied if the suffix is present and can be
<br>
removed. Name oversize or collision caused by suffix change
will prevent filtering. <br>
With most filter types this command will immediately run the
filter once for each file in order to determine the output
size. Content reading operations like -extract , <br>
-compare and image generation will perform further filter
runs and deliver filtered content. <br>
At image generation time the filter output must still be the
same as the output from the first run. Filtering for image
generation does not happen with files from the <br>
loaded ISO image if the write method of growing is in effect
(i.e -indev and -outdev are identical). <br>
The reserved filter name &quot;--remove-all-filters&quot;
revokes filtering. This will revoke suffix renamings as
well. Use &quot;--remove-all-filters+&quot; to prevent any
suffix renaming. <br>
Attaching or detaching filters will not alter the state of
-changes_pending. If the filter manipulations shall be the
only changes in a write run, then explicitly execute <br>
-changes_pending &quot;yes&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-set_filter_r name iso_rr_path
[***] <br>
Like -set_filter but affecting all data files below eventual
directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Writing the result, drive
control:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(see also paragraph about
settings below)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-rollback <br>
Discard the manipulated ISO image and reload it from -indev.
(Use -rollback_end if immediate program end is desired.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-changes_pending
&quot;no&quot;|&quot;yes&quot;|&quot;mkisofs_printed&quot;|&quot;show_status&quot;
<br>
Write runs are performed only if a change of the image has
been made since the image was loaded or created blank. Vice
versa the program will start a write run for pending <br>
changes when it ends normally (i.e. not by abort and not by
command -rollback_end). <br>
The command -changes_pending can be used to override the
automatically determined state. This is mainly useful for
setting state &quot;yes&quot; despite no real changes were
made. <br>
The sequence -changes_pending &quot;no&quot; -end is
equivalent to the command -rollback_end. State
&quot;mkisofs_printed&quot; is caused by emulation command
-as mkisofs if option <br>
-print-size is present. <br>
The pseudo-state &quot;show_status&quot; can be used to
print the current state to result channel. <br>
Image loading or manipulations which happen after this
command will again update automatically the change status of
the image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-commit <br>
Perform the write operation. Afterwards, if -outdev is
readable, make it the new -dev and load the image from
there. Switch to growing mode. (A subsequent -outdev will
<br>
activate modification mode or blind growing.) -commit is
performed automatically at end of program if there are
uncommitted manipulations pending. <br>
So, to perform a final write operation with no new -dev and
no new loading of image, rather execute command -end. If you
want to go on without image loading, execute <br>
-commit_eject &quot;none&quot;. To eject after write without
image loading, use -commit_eject &quot;all&quot;. <br>
To suppress a final write, execute -rollback_end.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Writing can last quite a while.
It is not unnormal with several types of media that there is
no progress visible for the first few minutes or that the
drive gnaws on the <br>
medium for a few minutes after all data have been
transmitted. xorriso and the drives are in a client-server
relationship. The drives have much freedom about what to do
<br>
with the media. Some combinations of drives and media simply
do not work, despite the promises by their vendors. If
writing fails then try other media or another drive. <br>
The reason for such failure is hardly ever in the code of
the various burn programs but you may well try some of those
listed below under SEE ALSO.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-eject
&quot;in&quot;|&quot;out&quot;|&quot;all&quot; <br>
Eject the medium in -indev, -outdev, or both drives,
respectively. Note: It is not possible yet to effectively
eject disk files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-commit_eject
&quot;in&quot;|&quot;out&quot;|&quot;all&quot;|&quot;none&quot;
<br>
Combined -commit and -eject. When writing has finished do
not make -outdev the new -dev, and load no ISO image. Rather
eject -indev and/or -outdev. Give up any non-ejected <br>
drive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-blank mode <br>
Make media ready for writing from scratch (if not -dummy is
activated). <br>
This affects only the -outdev not the -indev. If both drives
are the same and if the ISO image was altered then this
command leads to a FAILURE event. Defined modes are: <br>
as_needed, fast, all, deformat, deformat_quickest <br>
&quot;as_needed&quot; cares for used CD-RW, DVD-RW and for
used overwriteable media by applying -blank
&quot;fast&quot;. It applies -format &quot;full&quot; to yet
unformatted DVD-RAM and BD-RE. Other <br>
media in blank state are gracefully ignored. Media which
cannot be made ready for writing from scratch cause a
FAILURE event. <br>
&quot;fast&quot; makes CD-RW and unformatted DVD-RW
re-usable, or invalidates overwriteable ISO images.
&quot;all&quot; might work more thoroughly and need more
time. <br>
&quot;deformat&quot; converts overwriteable DVD-RW into
unformatted ones. <br>
&quot;deformat_quickest&quot; is a faster way to deformat or
blank DVD-RW but produces media which are only suitable for
a single session. Some drives announce this state by not
<br>
offering feature 21h, but some drives offer it anyway. If
feature 21h is missing, then xorriso will refuse to write on
DVD-RW if not command -close is set to &quot;on&quot;. <br>
The progress reports issued by some drives while blanking
are quite unrealistic. Do not conclude success or failure
from the reported percentages. Blanking was successful <br>
if no SORRY event or worse occurred. <br>
Mode may be prepended by &quot;force:&quot; in order to
override the evaluation of the medium state by libburn. E.g.
&quot;force:fast&quot;. Blanking will nevertheless only
succeed if the <br>
drive is willing to do it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-format mode <br>
Convert unformatted DVD-RW into overwriteable ones,
&quot;de-ice&quot; DVD+RW, format newly purchased BD-RE or
BD-R, re-format DVD-RAM or BD-RE. <br>
Defined modes are: <br>
as_needed, full, fast, by_index_&lt;num&gt;,
fast_by_index_&lt;num&gt;, <br>
by_size_&lt;num&gt;, fast_by_size_&lt;num&gt;, without_spare
<br>
&quot;as_needed&quot; formats yet unformatted DVD-RW,
DVD-RAM, BD-RE, or blank unformatted BD-R. Other media are
left untouched. <br>
&quot;full&quot; (re-)formats DVD-RW, DVD+RW, DVD-RAM,
BD-RE, or blank unformatted BD-R. <br>
&quot;fast&quot; does the same as &quot;full&quot; but tries
to be quicker. <br>
&quot;by_index_&quot; selects a format out of the descriptor
list issued by command -list_formats. The index number from
that list is to be appended to the mode word. E.g: <br>
&quot;by_index_3&quot;. <br>
&quot;fast_by_index_&quot; does the same as
&quot;by_index_&quot; but tries to be quicker. <br>
&quot;by_size_&quot; selects a format out of the descriptor
list which provides at least the given size. That size is to
be appended to the mode word. E.g:
&quot;by_size_4100m&quot;. This <br>
applies to media with Defect Management. On BD-RE it will
not choose format 0x31, which offers no Defect Management.
<br>
&quot;fast_by_size_&quot; does the same as
&quot;by_size_&quot; but tries to be quicker. <br>
&quot;without_spare&quot; selects the largest format out of
the descriptor list which provides no Spare Area for Defect
Management. On BD-RE this will be format 0x31. <br>
The formatting action has no effect on media if -dummy is
activated. <br>
Formatting is normally needed only once during the lifetime
of a medium, if ever. But it is a reason for re-formatting
if: <br>
DVD-RW was deformatted by -blank, <br>
DVD+RW has read failures (re-format before next write), <br>
DVD-RAM or BD-RE shall change their amount of defect
reserve. <br>
BD-R may be written unformatted or may be formatted before
first use. Formatting activates Defect Management which
tries to catch and repair bad spots on media during the <br>
write process at the expense of half speed even with
flawless media. <br>
The progress reports issued by some drives while formatting
are quite unrealistic. Do not conclude success or failure
from the reported percentages. Formatting was <br>
successful if no SORRY event or worse occurred. Be patient
with apparently frozen progress.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-list_formats <br>
Put out a list of format descriptors as reported by the
output drive for the current medium. The list gives the
index number after &quot;Format idx&quot;, a MMC format
code, the <br>
announced size in blocks (like &quot;2236704s&quot;) and the
same size in MiB. <br>
MMC format codes are manifold. Most important are:
&quot;00h&quot; general formatting, &quot;01h&quot;
increases reserve space for DVD-RAM, &quot;26h&quot; for
DVD+RW, &quot;30h&quot; for BD-RE with reserve <br>
space, &quot;31h&quot; for BD-RE without reserve space,
&quot;32h&quot; for BD-R. <br>
Smaller format size with DVD-RAM, BD-RE, or BD-R means more
reserve space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-list_speeds <br>
Put out a list of speed values as reported by the drives
with the loaded media. The list tells read speeds of the
input drive and of the output drive. Further it tells <br>
write speeds of the output drive. <br>
The list of write speeds does not necessarily mean that the
medium is writable or that these speeds are actually
achievable. Especially the lists reported with empty drive
<br>
or with ROM media obviously advertise speeds for other
media. <br>
It is not mandatory to use speed values out of the listed
range. The drive is supposed to choose a safe speed that is
as near to the desired speed as possible. <br>
At the end of the list, &quot;Write speed L&quot; and
&quot;Write speed H&quot; are the best guesses for lower and
upper write speed limit. &quot;Write speed l&quot; and
&quot;Write speed h&quot; may appear <br>
only with CD and eventually override the list of other speed
offers. <br>
Only if the drive reports contradicting speed information
there will appear &quot;Write speed 0&quot;, which tells the
outcome of speed selection by command -speed 0, if it
deviates <br>
from &quot;Write speed H&quot;. <br>
&quot;Read speed L&quot; and &quot;Read speed H&quot; tell
the minimum and maximum read speeds, as reported by the
drive. They would be chosen by -read_speed &quot;min&quot;
or &quot;max&quot; if they undercut <br>
or surpass the built-in limits. These are &quot;1x&quot;,
&quot;52xCD&quot;, &quot;24xDVD&quot;,
&quot;20xBD&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-close_damaged
&quot;as_needed&quot;|&quot;force&quot; <br>
Try to close the upcoming track and session if the drive
reported the medium as damaged. This may apply to CD-R,
CD-RW, DVD-R, DVD-RW, DVD+R, DVD+R DL, or BD-R media. It
<br>
is indicated by warning messages when the drive gets
acquired, and by a remark &quot;but next track is
damaged&quot; with the line &quot;Media status :&quot; of
command -toc. <br>
The setting of command -close determines whether the medium
stays appendable. <br>
Mode &quot;as_needed&quot; gracefully refuses on media which
are not reported as damaged. Mode &quot;force&quot; attempts
the close operation even with media which appear undamaged.
<br>
No image changes are allowed to be pending before this
command is performed. After closing was attempted, both
drives are given up.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-list_profiles
&quot;in&quot;|&quot;out&quot;|&quot;all&quot; <br>
Put out a list of media types supported by -indev, -outdev,
or both, respectively. The currently recognized type is
marked by text &quot;(current)&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Settings for result writing:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Rock Ridge info will be
generated by default. ACLs will be written according to the
setting of command -acl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-joliet
&quot;on&quot;|&quot;off&quot; <br>
If enabled by &quot;on&quot;, generate Joliet tree
additional to ISO 9660 + Rock Ridge tree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-hfsplus
&quot;on&quot;|&quot;off&quot; <br>
If enabled by &quot;on&quot;, generate a HFS+ filesystem
inside the ISO 9660 image and mark it by Apple Partition Map
(APM) entries in the System Area, the first 32 KiB of the
<br>
image. <br>
This may collide with data submitted by -boot_image
system_area=. The first 8 bytes of the System Area get
overwritten by { 0x45, 0x52, 0x08 0x00, 0xeb, 0x02, 0xff,
0xff <br>
} which can be executed as x86 machine code without negative
effects. So if an MBR gets combined with this feature, then
its first 8 bytes should contain no essential <br>
commands. <br>
The next blocks of 2 KiB in the System Area will be occupied
by APM entries. The first one covers the part of the ISO
image before the HFS+ filesystem metadata. The <br>
second one marks the range from HFS+ metadata to the end of
file content data. If more ISO image data follow, then a
third partition entry gets produced. Other features of <br>
xorriso might cause the need for more APM entries. <br>
The HFS+ filesystem is not suitable for add-on sessions
produced by the multi-session method of growing. An existing
ISO image may nevertheless be the base for a new image <br>
produced by the method of modifying. If -hfsplus is enabled
when -indev or -dev gets executed, then AAIP attributes get
loaded from the input image and checked for <br>
information about HFS creator, filetype, or blessing. If
found, then they get enabled as settings for the next image
production. Therefore it is advisable to perform <br>
-hfsplus &quot;on&quot; before -indev or -dev. <br>
Information about HFS creator, type, and blessings gets
stored by xorriso if -hfsplus is enabled at -commit time. It
is stored as copy outside the HFS+ partition, but <br>
rather along with the Rock Ridge information. xorriso does
not read any information from the HFS+ meta data. <br>
Be aware that HFS+ is case-insensitive although it can
record file names with upper-case and lower-case letters.
Therefore, file names from the iso_rr name tree may <br>
collide in the HFS+ name tree. In this case they get changed
by adding underscore characters and counting numbers. In
case of very long names, it might be necessary to map <br>
them to &quot;MANGLED_...&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-rockridge
&quot;on&quot;|&quot;off&quot; <br>
Mode &quot;off&quot; disables production of Rock Ridge
information for the ISO 9660 file objects. The multi-session
capabilities of xorriso depend much on the naming fidelity
of <br>
Rock Ridge. So it is strongly discouraged to deviate from
default setting &quot;on&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-compliance rule[:rule...] <br>
Adjust the compliance to specifications of ISO 9660/ECMA-119
and its contemporary extensions. In some cases it is worth
to deviate a bit in order to circumvent bugs of the <br>
intended reader system or to get unofficial extra features.
<br>
There are several adjustable rules which have a keyword
each. If they are mentioned with this command then their
rule gets added to the relaxation list. This list can be
<br>
erased by rules &quot;strict&quot; or &quot;clear&quot;. It
can be reset to its start setting by &quot;default&quot;.
All of the following relaxation rules can be revoked
individually by appending <br>
&quot;_off&quot;. Like &quot;deep_paths_off&quot;. <br>
Rule keywords are: <br>
&quot;iso_9660_level=&quot;number chooses level 1 with
ECMA-119 names of the form 8.3 and -file_size_limit &lt;= 4g
- 1, or level 2 with ECMA-119 names up to length 32 and the
same <br>
-file_size_limit, or level 3 with ECMA-119 names up to
length 32 and -file_size_limit &gt;= 400g -200k. If
necessary -file_size_limit gets adjusted. <br>
&quot;allow_dir_id_ext&quot; allows ECMA-119 names of
directories to have a name extension as with other file
types. It does not force dots and it omits the version
number, though. <br>
This is a bad tradition of mkisofs which violates ECMA-119.
Especially ISO level 1 only allows 8 characters in a
directory name and not 8.3. <br>
&quot;omit_version&quot; does not add versions
(&quot;;1&quot;) to ECMA-119 and Joliet file names. <br>
&quot;only_iso_version&quot; does not add versions
(&quot;;1&quot;) to Joliet file names. <br>
&quot;deep_paths&quot; allows ECMA-119 file paths deeper
than 8 levels. <br>
&quot;long_paths&quot; allows ECMA-119 file paths longer
than 255 characters. <br>
&quot;long_names&quot; allows up to 37 characters with
ECMA-119 file names. <br>
&quot;no_force_dots&quot; does not add a dot to ECMA-119
file names which have none. <br>
&quot;no_j_force_dots&quot; does not add a dot to Joliet
file names which have none. <br>
&quot;lowercase&quot; allows lowercase characters in
ECMA-119 file names. <br>
&quot;7bit_ascii&quot; allows nearly all 7-bit characters in
ECMA-119 file names. Not allowed are 0x0 and
&rsquo;/&rsquo;. If not &quot;lowercase&quot; is enabled,
then lowercase letters get converted <br>
to uppercase. <br>
&quot;full_ascii&quot; allows all 8-bit characters except
0x0 and &rsquo;/&rsquo; in ECMA-119 file names. <br>
&quot;untranslated_names&quot; might be dangerous for
inadverted reader programs which rely on the restriction to
at most 37 characters in ECMA-119 file names. This rule
allows <br>
ECMA-119 file names up to 96 characters with no character
conversion. If a file name has more characters, then image
production will fail deliberately. <br>
&quot;untranslated_name_len=&quot;number enables
untranslated_names with a smaller limit for the length of
file names. 0 disables this feature, -1 chooses maximum
length limit, <br>
numbers larger than 0 give the desired length limit. <br>
&quot;joliet_long_names&quot; allows Joliet leaf names up to
103 characters rather than 64. <br>
&quot;joliet_long_paths&quot; allows Joliet paths longer
than 240 characters. <br>
&quot;joliet_utf16&quot; encodes Joliet names in UTF-16BE
rather than UCS-2. The difference is with characters which
are not present in UCS-2 and get encoded in UTF-16 by 2
words <br>
of 16 bit each. Both words then stem from a reserved subset
of UCS-2. <br>
&quot;always_gmt&quot; stores timestamps in GMT
representation with timezone 0. <br>
&quot;rec_mtime&quot; records with non-RockRidge directory
entries the disk file&rsquo;s mtime and not the creation
time of the image. This applies to the ECMA-119 tree (plain
ISO 9660), <br>
to Joliet, and to ISO 9660:1999. &quot;rec_time&quot; is
default. If disabled, it gets automatically re-enabled by
-as mkisofs emulation when a pathspec is encountered. <br>
&quot;new_rr&quot; uses Rock Ridge version 1.12 (suitable
for GNU/Linux but not for older FreeBSD or for Solaris).
This implies &quot;aaip_susp_1_10_off&quot; which may be
changed by <br>
subsequent &quot;aaip_susp_1_10&quot;. <br>
Default is &quot;old_rr&quot; which uses Rock Ridge version
1.10. This implies also &quot;aaip_susp_1_10&quot; which may
be changed by subsequent &quot;aaip_susp_1_10_off&quot;.
<br>
&quot;aaip_susp_1_10&quot; allows AAIP to be written as
unofficial extension of RRIP rather than as official
extension under SUSP-1.12. <br>
&quot;no_emul_toc&quot; saves 64 kB with the first session
on overwriteable media but makes the image incapable of
displaying its session history. <br>
&quot;iso_9660_1999&quot; causes the production of an
additional directory tree compliant to ISO 9660:1999. It can
record long filenames for readers which do not understand
Rock <br>
Ridge. <br>
&quot;old_empty&quot; uses the old way of of giving block
addresses in the range of [0,31] to files with no own data
content. The new way is to have a dedicated block to which
all <br>
such files will point. <br>
Default setting is <br>

&quot;clear:only_iso_version:deep_paths:long_paths:no_j_force_dots:
<br>
always_gmt:old_rr&quot;. <br>
Note: The term &quot;ECMA-119 name&quot; means the plain ISO
9660 names and attributes which get visible if the reader
ignores Rock Ridge.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-rr_reloc_dir name <br>
Specify the name of the relocation directory in which deep
directory subtrees shall be placed if -compliance is set to
&quot;deep_paths_off&quot; or &quot;long_paths_off&quot;. A
deep <br>
directory is one that has a chain of 8 parent directories
(including root) above itself, or one that contains a file
with an ECMA-119 path of more than 255 characters. <br>
The overall directory tree will appear originally deep when
interpreted as Rock Ridge tree. It will appear as
re-arranged if only ECMA-119 information is considered. <br>
The default relocation directory is the root directory. By
giving a non-empty name with -rr_reloc_dir, a directory in
the root directory may get this role. If that <br>
directory does not already exist at -commit time, then it
will get created and marked for Rock Ridge as relocation
artefact. At least on GNU/Linux it will not be displayed
<br>
in mounted Rock Ridge images. <br>
The name must not contain a &rsquo;/&rsquo; character and
must not be longer than 255 bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-volid text <br>
Specify the volume ID, which most operating systems will
consider to be the volume name of the image or medium. <br>
xorriso accepts any text up to 32 characters, but according
to rarely obeyed specs stricter rules apply: <br>
ECMA-119 demands ASCII characters out of [A-Z0-9_]. Like:
<br>
&quot;IMAGE_23&quot; <br>
Joliet allows 16 UCS-2 characters. Like: <br>
&quot;Windows name&quot; <br>
Be aware that the volume id might get used automatically as
the name of the mount point when the medium is inserted into
a playful computer system. <br>
If an ISO image gets loaded while the volume ID is set to
default &quot;ISOIMAGE&quot; or to &quot;&quot;, then the
volume ID of the loaded image will become the effective
volume id for the <br>
next write run. But as soon as command -volid is performed
afterwards, this pending ID is overridden by the new
setting. <br>
Consider this when setting -volid &quot;ISOIMAGE&quot;
before executing -dev, -indev, or -rollback. If you insist
in -volid &quot;ISOIMAGE&quot;, set it again after those
commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-volset_id text <br>
Set the volume set ID string to be written with the next
-commit. Permissible are up to 128 characters. This setting
gets overridden by image loading.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-publisher text <br>
Set the publisher ID string to be written with the next
-commit. This may identify the person or organisation who
specified what shall be recorded. Permissible are up to <br>
128 characters. This setting gets overridden by image
loading.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-application_id text <br>
Set the application ID string to be written with the next
-commit. This may identify the specification of how the data
are recorded. Permissible are up to 128 characters. <br>
This setting gets overridden by image loading. <br>
The special text &quot;@xorriso@&quot; gets converted to the
ID string of xorriso which is normally written as
-preparer_id. It is a wrong tradition to write the program
ID as <br>
-application_id.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-system_id text <br>
Set the system ID string to be written with the next
-commit. This may identify the system which can recognize
and act upon the content of the System Area in image blocks
<br>
0 to 15. Permissible are up to 32 characters. This setting
gets overridden by image loading.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-volume_date type timestring
<br>
Set one of the four overall timestamps for subsequent image
writing. Available types are: <br>
&quot;c&quot; time when the volume was created. <br>
&quot;m&quot; time when volume was last modified. <br>
&quot;x&quot; time when the information in the volume
expires. <br>
&quot;f&quot; time since when the volume is effectively
valid. <br>
&quot;all_file_dates&quot; sets mtime, atime, and ctime of
all files and directories to the given time. If the
timestring is &quot;set_to_mtime&quot;, then the atime and
ctime of each file <br>
and directory get set to the value found in their mtime.
<br>
These actions stay delayed until actual ISO production
begins. Up to then they can be revoked by
&quot;all_file_dates&quot; with empty timestring or
timestring &quot;default&quot;. <br>
The timestamps of the El Torito boot catalog file get
refreshed when the ISO is produced. They can be influenced
by &quot;uuid&quot;. <br>
&quot;uuid&quot; sets a timestring that overrides
&quot;c&quot; and &quot;m&quot; times literally and sets the
time of the El Torito boot catalog. It must consist of 16
decimal digits which form <br>
YYYYMMDDhhmmsscc, with YYYY between 1970 and 2999. Time zone
is GMT. It is supposed to match this GRUB line: <br>
search --fs-uuid --set YYYY-MM-DD-hh-mm-ss-cc <br>
E.g. 2010040711405800 is 7 Apr 2010 11:40:58 (+0
centiseconds). <br>
Timestrings for the other types may be given as with command
-alter_date. Some of them are prone to timezone
computations. The timestrings &quot;default&quot; or
&quot;overridden&quot; cause <br>
default settings: &quot;c&quot; and &quot;m&quot; will show
the current time of image creation. &quot;x&quot; and
&quot;f&quot; will be marked as insignificant.
&quot;uuid&quot; will be deactivated. <br>
At -commit time, some timestamps get set to the maximum
value of effectively written volume creation and
modification time: El Torito boot catalog, HFS+ superblock,
<br>
ECMA-119 file modification time if -compliance
&quot;no_rec_mtime&quot;. The isohybrid MBR id is computed
from &quot;uuid&quot; if given, else from the effective
volume modification date.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-copyright_file text <br>
Set the copyright file name to be written with the next
-commit. This should be the ISO 9660 path of a file in the
image which contains a copyright statement. Permissible <br>
are up to 37 characters. This setting gets overridden by
image loading.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-abstract_file text <br>
Set the abstract file name to be written with the next
-commit. This should be the ISO 9660 path of a file in the
image which contains an abstract statement about the <br>
image content. Permissible are up to 37 characters. This
setting gets overridden by image loading.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-biblio_file text <br>
Set the biblio file name to be written with the next
-commit. This should be the ISO 9660 path of a file in the
image which contains bibliographic records. Permissible <br>
are up to 37 characters. This setting gets overridden by
image loading.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-preparer_id <br>
Set the preparer ID string to be written with the next
-commit. This may identify the person or other entity which
controls the preparation of the data which shall be <br>
recorded. Normally this should be the ID of xorriso and not
of the person or program which operates xorriso. Please
avoid to change it. Permissible are up to 128 <br>
characters. <br>
The special text &quot;@xorriso@&quot; gets converted to the
ID string of xorriso which is default at program startup.
<br>
Unlike other ID strings, this setting is not influenced by
image loading.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-application_use
character|0xXY|disk_path <br>
Specify the content of the Application Use field which can
take at most 512 bytes. <br>
If the parameter of this command is empty, then the field is
filled with 512 0-bytes. If it is a single character, then
it gets repeated 512 times. If it begins by &quot;0x&quot;
<br>
followed by two hex digits [0-9a-fA-F], then the digits are
read as byte value which gets repeated 512 times. <br>
Any other parameter text is used as disk_path to open a data
file and to read up to 512 bytes from it. If the file is
smaller than 512 bytes, then the remaining bytes in <br>
the field get set to binary 0. <br>
This setting is not influenced by image loading.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-out_charset character_set_name
<br>
Set the character set to which file names get converted when
writing an image. See paragraph &quot;Character sets&quot;
for more explanations. When loading the written image after
<br>
-commit the setting of -out_charset will be copied to
-in_charset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-uid uid <br>
User id to be used for all files when the new ISO tree gets
written to media.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-gid gid <br>
Group id to be used for all files when the new ISO tree gets
written to media.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-zisofs option[:options] <br>
Set global parameters for zisofs compression. This data
format is recognized and transparently uncompressed by some
Linux kernels. It is to be applied via command <br>
-set_filter with built-in filter &quot;--zisofs&quot;.
Parameters are: <br>
&quot;level=&quot;[0-9] zlib compression: 0=none,
1=fast,..., 9=slow <br>
&quot;block_size=&quot;32k|64k|128k size of compression
blocks <br>
&quot;by_magic=on&quot; enables an expensive test at image
generation time which checks files from disk whether they
already are zisofs compressed, e.g. by program mkzftree.
<br>
&quot;default&quot; same as
&quot;level=6:block_size=32k:by_magic=off&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-speed code|number[k|m|c|d|b]
<br>
Set the burn speed. Default is &quot;max&quot; (or
&quot;0&quot;) = maximum speed as announced by the drive.
Further special speed codes are: <br>
&quot;min&quot; (or &quot;-1&quot;) selects minimum speed as
announced by the drive. <br>
&quot;none&quot; avoids to send a speed setting command to
the drive before burning begins. <br>
Speed can be given in media dependent numbers or as a
desired throughput per second in MMC compliant kB (= 1000)
or MB (= 1000 kB). Media x-speed factor can be set <br>
explicitly by &quot;c&quot; for CD, &quot;d&quot; for DVD,
&quot;b&quot; for BD, &quot;x&quot; is optional. <br>
Example speeds: <br>
706k = 706kB/s = 4c = 4xCD <br>
5540k = 5540kB/s = 4d = 4xDVD <br>
If there is no hint about the speed unit attached, then the
medium in the -outdev will decide. Default unit is CD =
176.4k. <br>
MMC drives usually activate their own idea of speed and take
the speed value given by the burn program only as upper
limit for their own decision.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-stream_recording
&quot;on&quot;|&quot;off&quot;|&quot;full&quot;|&quot;data&quot;|number
<br>
Setting &quot;on&quot; tries to circumvent the management of
defects on DVD-RAM, BD-RE, or BD-R. Defect management keeps
partly damaged media usable. But it reduces write speed to
<br>
half nominal speed even if the medium is in perfect shape.
For the case of flawless media, one may use
-stream_recording &quot;on&quot; to get full speed. <br>
&quot;full&quot; tries full speed with all write operations,
whereas &quot;on&quot; does this only above byte address
32s. One may give a number of at least 16s in order to set
an own address <br>
limit. <br>
&quot;data&quot; causes full speed to start when superblock
and directory entries are written and writing of file
content blocks begins.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dvd_obs
&quot;default&quot;|&quot;32k&quot;|&quot;64k&quot; <br>
GNU/Linux specific: Set the number of bytes to be
transmitted with each write operation to DVD or BD media. A
number of 64 KB may improve throughput with bus systems
which <br>
show latency problems. The default depends on media type, on
command -stream_recording , and on compile time options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-modesty_on_drive
parameter[:parameters] <br>
Control whether the drive buffer shall be kept from getting
completely filled. Parameter &quot;on&quot; (or
&quot;1&quot;) keeps the program from trying to write to the
burner drive while <br>
its buffer is in danger to be filled over a given limit. If
this limit is exceeded then the program will wait until the
filling reaches a given low percentage value. <br>
This can ease the load on operating system and drive
controller and thus help with achieving better input
bandwidth if disk and burner are not on independent
controllers <br>
(like hda and hdb). It may also help with throughput
problems of simultaneous burns on different burners with
Linux kernels like 3.16, if one has reason not to fix the
<br>
problem by -scsi_dev_family &quot;sg&quot;. On the other
hand it increases the risk of buffer underflow and thus
reduced write speed. <br>
Some burners are not suitable because they report buffer
fill with granularity too coarse in size or time, or expect
their buffer to be filled to the top before they go to <br>
full speed. <br>
Parameters &quot;off&quot; or &quot;0&quot; disable this
feature. <br>
The threshold for beginning to wait is given by parameter
&quot;max_percent=&quot;. Parameter &quot;min_percent=&quot;
defines the threshold for resuming transmission. Percentages
are <br>
permissible in the range of 25 to 100. Numbers in this range
without a prepended name are interpreted as
&quot;on:min_percent=&quot;. <br>
E.g.: -modesty_on_drive 75 <br>
The optimal values depend on the buffer behavior of the
drive. <br>
Parameter &quot;timeout_sec=&quot; defines after which time
of unsuccessful waiting the modesty shall be disabled
because it does not work. <br>
Parameter &quot;min_usec=&quot; defines the initial sleeping
period in microseconds. If the drive buffer appears to be
too full for sending more data, the program will wait the
<br>
given time and inquire the buffer fill state again. If
repeated inquiry shows not enough free space, the sleep time
will slowly be increased to what parameter
&quot;max_usec=&quot; <br>
defines. <br>
Parameters, which are not mentioned with a -modesty_on_drive
command, stay unchanged. Default is: <br>
-modesty_on_drive off:min_percent=90:max_percent=95: <br>
timeout_sec=120:min_usec=5000:max_usec=25000</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-use_immed_bit
&quot;on&quot;|&quot;off&quot;|&quot;default&quot; <br>
Control whether several long lasting SCSI commands shall be
executed with the Immed bit, which makes the commands end
early while the drive operation is still going on. <br>
xorriso then inquires progress indication until the drive
reports to be ready again. If this feature is turned off,
then blanking and formatting will show no progress <br>
indication. <br>
It may depend on the operating system whether -use_immed_bit
is set to &quot;off&quot; by default. Command -status will
tell by appending &quot;/on&quot; or &quot;/off&quot; if a
drive has already been <br>
acquired and -use_immed_bit is currently set to
&quot;default&quot;. Command -use_immed_bit tolerates and
ignores such appended text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-stdio_sync
&quot;on&quot;|&quot;off&quot;|&quot;end&quot;|number <br>
Set the number of bytes after which to force output to
stdio: pseudo drives. This forcing keeps the memory from
being clogged with lots of pending data for slow devices.
<br>
Default &quot;on&quot; is the same as &quot;16m&quot;.
Forced output can be disabled by &quot;off&quot;, or be
delayed by &quot;end&quot; until all data are produced. If a
number is chosen, then it must be at <br>
least 64k.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dummy
&quot;on&quot;|&quot;off&quot; <br>
If &quot;on&quot; then simulate burning or refuse with
FAILURE event if no simulation is possible, do neither blank
nor format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fs
number[&quot;k&quot;|&quot;m&quot;] <br>
Set the size of the fifo buffer which smoothens the data
stream from ISO image generation to media burning. Default
is 4 MiB, minimum 64 kiB, maximum 1 GiB. The number <br>
may be followed by letter &quot;k&quot; or &quot;m&quot;
which means unit is kiB (= 1024) or MiB (= 1024 kiB).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-close
&quot;on&quot;|&quot;off&quot;|&quot;as_needed&quot; <br>
If -close is set to &quot;on&quot; then mark the written
medium as not appendable any more. This will have no effect
on overwritable media types. Setting &quot;on&quot; is the
contrary of <br>
cdrecord option -multi, and is one aspect of growisofs
option -dvd-compat. <br>
If set to &quot;off&quot; then keep the medium writable for
an appended session. <br>
If set to &quot;as_needed&quot; then use &quot;on&quot; only
if &quot;off&quot; is predicted to fail with the given
medium and its state. <br>
Not all drives correctly recognize fast-blanked DVD-RW which
need &quot;on&quot;. If there is well founded suspicion that
a burn run failed due to -close &quot;off&quot;, then -close
<br>
&quot;as_needed&quot; causes a re-try with &quot;on&quot;.
<br>
Note that emulation command -as &quot;cdrecord&quot;
temporarily overrides the current setting of -close by its
own default -close &quot;on&quot; if its option -multi is
missing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-write_type
&quot;auto&quot;|&quot;tao&quot;|&quot;sao/dao&quot; <br>
Set the write type for the next burn run. &quot;auto&quot;
will select SAO with blank CD media, DAO with blank DVD-R[W]
if -close is &quot;on&quot;, and elsewise CD TAO or the
equivalent <br>
write type of the particular DVD/BD media. Choosing TAO or
SAO/DAO explicitly might cause the burn run to fail if the
desired write type is not possible with the given <br>
media state.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-padding
number[&quot;k&quot;|&quot;m&quot;]|&quot;included&quot;|&quot;appended&quot;
<br>
Append the given number of extra bytes to the image stream.
This is a traditional remedy for a traditional bug in block
device read drivers. Needed only for CD recordings <br>
in TAO mode. Since one can hardly predict on what media an
image might end up, xorriso adds the traditional 300k of
padding by default to all images. <br>
For images which will never get to a CD it is safe to use
-padding 0 . <br>
Normally padding is not written as part of the ISO image but
appended after the image end. This is -padding mode
&quot;appended&quot;. <br>
Emulation command -as &quot;mkisofs&quot; and command -jigdo
cause padding to be written as part of the image. The same
effect is achieved by -padding mode
&quot;included&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bootable ISO images:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Contrary to published
specifications many BIOSes will load an El Torito record
from the first session on media and not from the last one,
which gets mounted by default. This <br>
makes no problems with overwriteable media, because they
appear to inadverted readers as one single session. <br>
But with multi-session media CD-R[W], DVD-R[W], DVD+R, it
implies that the whole bootable system has to reside already
in the first session and that the last session still has to
<br>
bear all files which the booted system expects after
mounting the ISO image. <br>
If a boot image from ISOLINUX or GRUB is known to be present
on media then it is advised to patch it when a follow-up
session gets written. But one should not rely on the <br>
capability to influence the bootability of the existing
sessions, unless one can assume overwriteable media. <br>
Normally the boot images are data files inside the ISO
filesystem. By special path
&quot;--interval:appended_partition_NNN:all::&quot; it is
possible to refer to an appended partition. The <br>
number NNN gives the partition number as used with the
corresponding option -append_partition. E.g.: <br>
-append_partition 2 0xef /tmp/efi.img <br>
-e --interval:appended_partition_2:all:: <br>
There are booting mechanisms which do not use an El Torito
record but rather start at the first bytes of the image:
PC-BIOS MBR or EFI GPT for hard-disk-like devices, APM <br>
partition entries for Macs which expect HFS+ boot images,
MIPS Volume Header for old SGI computers, DEC Boot Block for
old MIPS DECstation, SUN Disk Label for SPARC machines, <br>
HP-PA boot sector for HP PA-RISC machines, DEC Alpha SRM
boot sector for old DEC Alpha machines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Several of the following
commands expect disk paths as input but also accept
description strings for the libisofs interval reader, which
is able to cut out data from disk files <br>
or -indev and to zeroize parts of the content: command
-append_partition, boot specs system_area=, grub2_mbr=,
prep_boot_part=, efi_boot_part=. <br>
The description string consists of the following components,
separated by colon &rsquo;:&rsquo; <br>

&quot;--interval:&quot;Flags&quot;:&quot;Interval&quot;:&quot;Zeroizers&quot;:&quot;Source
<br>
The component &quot;--interval&quot; states that this is not
a plain disk path but rather an interval reader description
string. The component Flags modifies the further
interpretation: <br>
&quot;local_fs&quot; demands to read from a file depicted by
the path in Source. <br>
&quot;imported_iso&quot; demands to read from the -indev.
This works only if -outdev is not the same as -indev. The
Source component is ignored. <br>
&quot;appended_partition_NNN&quot; with a decimal number NNN
works only for -boot_image bootspecs which announce El
Torito boot image paths: bin_path=, efi_path=. The number
gives the <br>
partition number as used with the corresponding option
-append_partition. <br>
The component Interval consists of two byte address numbers
separated by a &quot;-&quot; character. E.g.
&quot;0-429&quot; means to read bytes 0 to 429. <br>
The component Zeroizers consists of zero or more comma
separated strings. They define which part of the read data
to zeroize. Byte number 0 means the byte read from the
Interval <br>
start address. Each string may be one of: <br>
&quot;zero_mbrpt&quot; demands to zeroize the MBR partition
table if bytes 510 and 511 bear the MBR signature 0x55 0xaa.
<br>
&quot;zero_gpt&quot; demands to check for a GPT header in
bytes 512 to 1023, to zeroize it and its partition table
blocks. <br>
&quot;zero_apm&quot; demands to check for an APM block 0 and
to zeroize its partition table blocks. <br>
Start_byte&quot;-&quot;End_byte demands to zeroize the
read-in bytes beginning with number Start_byte and ending
after End_byte. <br>
The component Source is the file path with flag
&quot;local_fs&quot;, and ignored with flag
&quot;imported_iso&quot;. <br>
Byte numbers may be scaled by a suffix out of {k,m,g,t,s,d}
meaning multiplication by {1024, 1024k, 1024m, 1024g, 2048,
512}. A scaled value end number depicts the last byte of
<br>
the scaled range. <br>
E.g. &quot;0d-0d&quot; is &quot;0-511&quot;. <br>
Examples: <br>

&quot;local_fs:0-32767:zero_mbrpt,zero_gpt,440-443:/tmp/template.iso&quot;

<br>
bootspec|&quot;next&quot; <br>
Define the equipment of the emerging filesystem with boot
entry points. <br>
With systems which boot via BIOS or EFI this is a set of El
Torito boot images, possibly MBR boot code, and possibly
partition tables of type MBR, GPT, or APM. Such file <br>
sets get produced by boot loader systems like ISOLINUX or
GRUB.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each -boot_image command has two
parameters: type and setting. More than one -boot_image
command may be used to define the handling of one or more
boot images. Sequence <br>
matters. <br>
Types isolinux and grub care for known peculiarities. Type
any makes no assumptions about the origin of the boot
images.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When loading an ISO filesystem,
system area and El Torito boot images get loaded, too. The
default behavior is not to write loaded El Torito boot
images and to write the <br>
loaded system area content without alterations. <br>
discard gives up the El Torito boot catalog and its boot
images. regardless whether loaded from an ISO filesystem or
defined by commands. Any BIOS or EFI related boot <br>
options get revoked. Nevertheless, loaded system area data
stay valid. If desired, they have to be erased by <br>
-boot_image any system_area=/dev/zero <br>
keep keeps or copies El Torito boot images unaltered and
writes a new catalog. <br>
patch applies patching to existing El Torito boot images if
they seem to bear a boot info table. <br>
A boot info table needs to be patched when the boot image
gets newly introduced into the ISO image or if an existing
image gets relocated. This is automatically done if <br>
type &quot;isolinux&quot; or &quot;grub&quot; is given, but
not with &quot;any&quot;. <br>
If patching is enabled, then boot images from previous
sessions will be checked whether they seem to bear a boot
info table. If not, then they stay unpatched. This check
<br>
is not infallible. So if you do know that the images need no
patching, use &quot;any&quot; &quot;keep&quot;.
&quot;grub&quot; &quot;patch&quot; will not patch EFI images
(platform_id=0xef). <br>
replay is a more modern version of &quot;patch&quot;, which
not only cares for existing El Torito boot equipment but
also for the recognizable boot provisions in the System
Area. It <br>
discards any existing -boot_image setting and executes the
commands proposed by command -report_el_torito
&quot;cmd&quot;. <br>
This action will only succeed if the file objects mentioned
in the output of command -report_el_torito &quot;cmd&quot;
are still available. Do not remove or rename boot image
files <br>
after -indev. <br>
Drop unknown El Torito: -boot_image &quot;any&quot;

show_status will print what is known about the loaded boot
images and their designated fate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A bootspec is a word of the form
name=value. It is used to describe the parameters of a boot
feature. The names &quot;dir&quot;, &quot;bin_path&quot;,
&quot;efi_path&quot; lead to El Torito bootable <br>
images. Name &quot;system_area&quot; activates a given file
as MBR or other disk header. <br>
On all media types this is possible within the first
session. In further sessions an existing boot image can get
replaced by a new one, but depending on the media type <br>
this may have few effect at boot time. See above. <br>
El Torito boot images have to be added to the ISO image by
normal means (image loading, -map, -add, ...). In case of
ISOLINUX the files should reside either in ISO image <br>
directory /isolinux or in /boot/isolinux . In that case it
suffices to use as bootspec the text
&quot;dir=/isolinux&quot; or &quot;dir=/boot/isolinux&quot;.
E.g.: <br>
-boot_image isolinux dir=/boot/isolinux <br>
which bundles these individual settings: <br>
-boot_image isolinux bin_path=/boot/isolinux/isolinux.bin
<br>
-boot_image isolinux cat_path=/boot/isolinux/boot.cat <br>
-boot_image isolinux load_size=2048 <br>
-boot_image any boot_info_table=on <br>
An El Torito boot catalog file gets inserted into the ISO
image with address cat_path= with the first -boot_image
&quot;any&quot; &quot;next&quot; or at -commit time. It is
subject to normal <br>
-overwrite and -reassure processing if there is already a
file with the same name. The catalog lists the boot images
and is read by the boot facility to choose one of the <br>
boot images. But it is not necessary that it appears in the
directory tree at all. One may hide it in all trees by
cat_hidden=on. Other possible values are &quot;iso_rr&quot;,
<br>
&quot;joliet&quot;, &quot;hfsplus&quot;, and the default
&quot;off&quot;. The timestamps of the boot catalog file are
refreshed at commit time. Command -volume_date
&quot;uuid&quot; can be used to set their <br>
value. <br>
bin_path= depicts an El Torito boot image file, a binary
program which is to be started by the hardware boot facility
(e.g. the BIOS) at boot time. <br>
efi_path= depicts an El Torito boot image file that is ready
for EFI booting. This is normally a FAT filesystem image not
larger than 65535 blocks of 512 bytes (= 32 MiB - <br>
512). Its load_size is determined automatically, no boot
info table gets written, no boot medium gets emulated,
platform_id is 0xef. <br>
emul_type= can be one of &quot;no_emulation&quot;,
&quot;hard_disk&quot;, &quot;diskette&quot;. It controls the
boot medium emulation code of a boot image. The default
&quot;no_emulation&quot; is suitable for <br>
ISOLINUX, GRUB, FreeBSD cdboot. <br>
load_size= is a value which depends on the boot image.
Default 2048 should be overridden only if a better value is
known. <br>
boot_info_table=on causes address patching to bytes 8 to 63
of the boot image which is given by &quot;any&quot;
&quot;bin_path=&quot;. &quot;boot_info_table=off&quot;
disables this patching. <br>
grub2_boot_info=on causes address patching to byte 2548 of
the boot image which is given by &quot;any&quot;
&quot;bin_path=&quot;. The address is written as 64 bit
little-endian number. It <br>
is the 2KB block address of the boot image content,
multiplied by 4, and then incremented by 5.
&quot;grub2_boot_info=off&quot; disables this patching. <br>
platform_id= defines by a hexadecimal or decimal number the
Platform ID of the boot image. &quot;0x00&quot; is 80x86
PC-BIOS, &quot;0x01&quot; is PowerPC, &quot;0x02&quot; is
Mac, &quot;0xef&quot; is EFI <br>
(decimal &quot;239&quot;). <br>
id_string=text|56_hexdigits defines the ID string of the
boot catalog section where the boot image will be listed. If
the value consists of 56 characters [0-9A-Fa-f] then <br>
it is converted into 28 bytes, else the first 28 characters
become the ID string. The ID string of the first boot image
becomes the overall catalog ID. It is limited to <br>
24 characters. Other id_strings become section IDs. <br>
sel_crit=hexdigits defines the Selection Criteria of the
boot image. Up to 20 bytes get read from the given
characters [0-9A-Fa-f]. They get attributed to the boot
image <br>
entry in the catalog. <br>
next ends the definition of a boot image and starts a new
one. Any following -bootimage bootspecs will affect the new
image. The first &quot;next&quot; discards loaded boot
images <br>
and their catalog. <br>
system_area=disk_path copies at most 32768 bytes from the
given disk file to the very start of the ISO image. This
System Area is reserved for system dependent boot <br>
software, e.g. an MBR which can be used to boot from USB
stick or hard disk. <br>
Other than an El Torito boot image, the file disk_path needs
not to be added to the ISO image. <br>
-boot_image isolinux system_area= implies
&quot;partition_table=on&quot;. In this case, the disk path
should lead to one of the SYSLINUX files isohdp[fp]x*.bin or
to a file which <br>
was derived from one of those files. E.g. to the first 512
bytes from an ISOLINUX isohybrid ISO image. <br>
In this case, El Torito boot images (dir=, bin_path=,
efi_path=) may be augmented by isolinux
partition_entry=gpt_basdat or isolinux
partition_entry=gpt_hfsplus, and by <br>
isolinux partition_entry=apm_hfsplus. The boot image will
then be mentioned in GPT as Basic Data or GPT HFS+
partition, and in APM as HFS+ partition. The first three GPT
<br>
partitions will also be marked by MBR partitions. <br>
In multi-session situations the existing System Area is
preserved by default. In in this case, the special disk_path
&quot;.&quot; prevents reading of a disk file but
nevertheless <br>
causes adjustments in the loaded system area data. Such
adjustments may get ordered by -boot_image commands. <br>
-boot_image any gpt_disk_guid=value controls whether an
emerging GPT shall get a randomly generated disk GUID or
whether the GUID is supplied by the user. Value
&quot;random&quot; <br>
is default. Value &quot;volume_date_uuid&quot; produces a
low quality GUID from the value set by -volume_date
&quot;uuid&quot;. <br>
A string of 32 hex digits, or a RFC 4122 compliant GUID
string may be used to set the disk GUID directly. UEFI
prescribes the first three components of a RFC 4122 GUID
<br>
string to be byte-swapped in the binary representation: <br>
E.g. gpt_disk_guid=2303cd2a-73c7-424a-a298-25632da7f446
equals gpt_disk_guid=2acd0323c7734a42a29825632da7f446 <br>
The partition GUIDs get generated by minimally varying the
disk GUID. <br>
-boot_image any part_like_isohybrid=on enables -boot_image
isolinux partition_entry= even if no -boot_image isolinux
system_area= is given. No MBR partition of type 0xee <br>
emerges, even if GPT gets produced. Gaps between GPT and APM
partitions will not be filled by more partitions. Appended
partitions get mentioned in APM if other APM <br>
partitions emerge. <br>
grub2_mbr=disk_path works like &quot;any&quot; system_area=
with additional patching for modern GRUB MBRs. The content
start address of the first boot image is converted to a
count <br>
of 512 byte blocks, and an offset of 4 is added. The result
is written as 64 bit little-endian number to byte address
0x1b0. <br>
This feature can be revoked either by grub2_mbr= with empty
disk path, or by submitting a disk_path via system_area=.
<br>
partition_table=on causes a simple partition table to be
written into bytes 446 to 511 of the System Area. <br>
With type &quot;isolinux&quot; it shows a partition that
begins at byte 0 and it causes the LBA of the first boot
image to be written into the MBR. For the first session this
works <br>
only if also &quot;system_area=&quot; and
&quot;bin_path=&quot; or &quot;dir=&quot; is given. <br>
With types &quot;any&quot; and &quot;grub&quot; it shows a
single partition which starts at byte 512 and ends where the
ISO image ends. This works with or without system_area= or
boot image. <br>
Bootspecs chrp_boot_part=, prep_boot_part=, and
efi_boot_part= overwrite this entry in the MBR partition
table. <br>
If types &quot;isolinux&quot; or &quot;grub&quot; are set to
&quot;patch&quot;, then &quot;partition_table=on&quot; is
activated without new boot image. In this case the existing
System Area gets checked <br>
whether it bears addresses and sizes as if it had been
processed by &quot;partition_table=on&quot;. If so, then
those parameters get updated when the new System Area is
written. <br>
Special &quot;system_area=/dev/zero&quot; causes 32k of
NUL-bytes. Use this to discard an MBR which was loaded with
the ISO image. <br>
appended_part_as=gpt marks partitions from -append_partition
in GPT rather than in MBR. In this case the MBR shows a
single partition of type 0xee which covers the whole <br>
output data. <br>
appended_part_as=mbr is the default. Appended partitions get
marked in GPT only if GPT is produced because of other
settings. If given explicitly, this clears setting <br>
&quot;gpt&quot; and &quot;apm&quot;. Nevertheless
&quot;apm&quot; may be added to &quot;mbr&quot;. <br>
appended_part_as=apm marks partitions from -append_partition
in APM additionally to &quot;mbr&quot; or &quot;gpt&quot;.
<br>
By default, appended partitions get marked in APM only if
APM is produced because of other options together with
part_like_isohybrid=&quot;on&quot;. <br>
chrp_boot_part=on causes a single partition in MBR which
covers the whole ISO image and has type 0x96. This is not
compatible with any other feature that produces MBR <br>
partition entries. It makes GPT unrecognizable. <br>
prep_boot_part=disk_path inserts the content of a data file
into the image and marks it by an MBR partition of type
0x41. The parts of the ISO image before and after this <br>
partition will be covered by further MBR partitions. The
data file is supposed to contain ELF executable code. <br>
efi_boot_part=disk_path inserts the content of a data file
into the image and marks it by a GPT partition. If not
chrp_boot_part=on, then the first partition in MBR will <br>
have type 0xee to announce the presence of GPT. The data
file is supposed to contain a FAT filesystem. <br>
Instead of a disk_path, the word --efi-boot-image may be
given. It exposes in GPT the content of the first El Torito
EFI boot image as EFI system partition. EFI boot <br>
images are introduced by bootspec efi_path=. The affected
EFI boot image cannot show up in HFS+ because it is stored
outside the HFS+ partition. <br>
partition_offset=2kb_block_adr causes a partition table with
a single partition that begins at the given block address.
This is counted in 2048 byte blocks, not in 512 <br>
byte blocks. If the block address is non-zero then it must
be at least 16. A non-zero partition offset causes two
superblocks to be generated and two sets of directory <br>
trees. The image is then mountable from its absolute start
as well as from the partition start. <br>
The offset value of an ISO image gets preserved when a new
session is added. So the value defined here is only in
effect if a new ISO image gets written. <br>
partition_hd_cyl=number gives the number of heads per
cylinder for the partition table. 0 chooses a default value.
Maximum is 255. <br>
partition_sec_hd=number gives the number of sectors per head
for the partition table. 0 chooses a default value. Maximum
is 63. <br>
The product partition_sec_hd * partition_hd_cyl * 512 is the
cylinder size. It should be divisible by 2048 in order to
make exact alignment possible. With appended <br>
partitions and &quot;appended_part_as=gpt&quot; there is no
limit for the number of cylinders. Else there may be at most
1024 of them. If the cylinder size is too small to stay <br>
below the limit, then appropriate values of partition_hd_cyl
are chosen with partition_sec_hd 32 or 63. If the image is
larger than 8,422,686,720 bytes, then the cylinder <br>
size constraints cannot be fulfilled for MBR. <br>
partition_cyl_align=mode controls image size alignment to an
integer number of cylinders. It is prescribed by isohybrid
specs and it seems to please program fdisk. <br>
Cylinder size must be divisible by 2048. Images larger than
8,323,596,288 bytes cannot be aligned in MBR partition
table. <br>
Mode &quot;auto&quot; is default. Alignment by padding
happens only with &quot;isolinux&quot;
&quot;partition_table=on&quot;. <br>
Mode &quot;on&quot; causes alignment by padding with
&quot;partition_table=on&quot; for any type. Mode
&quot;all&quot; is like &quot;on&quot; but also pads up
partitions from -append_partition to an aligned <br>
size. <br>
Mode &quot;off&quot; disables alignment for any type. <br>
mbr_force_bootable=mode enforces an MBR partition with
&quot;bootable/active&quot; flag if options like
partition_table= or grub2_mbr= indicate production of a
bootable MBR. These <br>
options normally cause the flag to be set if there is an MBR
partition of type other than 0xee or 0xef. If no such
partition exists, then no bootflag is set, unless <br>
mbr_force_bootable= forces creation of a dummy partition of
type 0x00 which covers only the first block of the ISO
image. <br>
mips_path=iso_rr_path declares a data file in the image to
be a MIPS Big Endian boot file and causes production of a
MIPS Big Endian Volume Header. This is mutually <br>
exclusive with production of other boot blocks like MBR. It
will overwrite the first 512 bytes of any data provided by
system_area=. Up to 15 boot files can be declared <br>
by mips_path=. <br>
mipsel_path=iso_rr_path declares a data file in the image to
be the MIPS Little Endian boot file. This is mutually
exclusive with other boot blocks. It will overwrite the <br>
first 512 bytes of any data provided by system_area=. Only a
single boot file can be declared by mipsel_path=. <br>
sparc_label=text causes the production of a SUN Disk Label
with the given text as ASCII label. Partitions 2 to 8 may be
occupied by appended images. Partition 1 will <br>
always be the ISO image. See command -append_partition. The
first 512 bytes of any data provided by system_area= will be
overwritten. <br>
grub2_sparc_core=iso_rr_path causes the content address and
size of the given file to be written after the SUN Disk
Label. Both numbers are counted in bytes. The address <br>
is written as 64 bit big-endian number to byte 0x228. The
size is written as 32 bit big-endian number to byte 0x230.
<br>
hppa_cmdline=text sets the PALO command line for HP-PA. Up
to 1023 characters are permitted by default. With
hppa_hdrversion=4 the limit is 127. <br>
Note that the first five hppa_ bootspecs are mandatory, if
any of the hppa_ bootspecs is used. Only hppa_hdrversion= is
allowed to be missing. <br>
hppa_bootloader=iso_rr_path designates the given path as
HP-PA bootloader file. <br>
hppa_kernel_32=iso_rr_path designates the given path as
HP-PA 32 bit kernel file. <br>
hppa_kernel_64=iso_rr_path designates the given path as
HP-PA 64 bit kernel file. <br>
hppa_ramdisk=iso_rr_path designates the given path as HP-PA
RAM disk file. <br>
hppa_hdrversion=number chooses between PALO header version 5
(default) and version 4. For the appropriate value see in
PALO source code: PALOHDRVERSION. <br>
alpha_boot=iso_rr_path declares a data file in the image to
be the DEC Alpha SRM Secondary Bootstrap Loader and causes
production of a boot sector which points to it. <br>
This is mutually exclusive with production of other boot
blocks like MBR. <br>
mips_discard, sparc_discard, hppa_discard, alpha_discard
revoke any boot file declarations made for mips/mipsel,
sparc, hppa, or alpha, respectively. This removes the ban
<br>
on production of other boot blocks. <br>
hfsplus_serial=hexstring sets a string of 16 digits
&quot;0&quot; to &quot;9&quot; and letters &quot;a&quot; to
&quot;f&quot;, which will be used as unique serial number of
an emerging HFS+ filesystem. <br>
hfsplus_block_size=number sets the allocation block size to
be used when producing HFS+ filesystems. Permissible are
512, 2048, or 0. The latter lets the program decide. <br>
apm_block_size=number sets the block size to be used when
describing partitions by an Apple Partition Map. Permissible
are 512, 2048, or 0. The latter lets the program <br>
decide. <br>
Note that size 512 is not compatible with production of GPT,
and that size 2048 will not be mountable -t hfsplus at least
by older Linux kernels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-append_partition
partition_number type_code disk_path <br>
Cause a prepared filesystem image to be appended to the ISO
image and to be described by a partition table entry in a
boot block at the start of the emerging ISO image. <br>
The partition entry will bear the size of the submitted file
rounded up to the next multiple of 2048 bytes or to the next
multiple of the cylinder size. <br>
Beware of subsequent multi-session runs. The appended
partition will get overwritten. <br>
Partitions may be appended with boot block type MBR and with
SUN Disk Label. <br>
With MBR: <br>
partition_number may be 1 to 4. Number 1 will put the whole
ISO image into the unclaimed space before partition 1. So
together with most xorriso MBR features, number 2 <br>
would be the most natural choice. <br>
The type_code may be &quot;FAT12&quot;, &quot;FAT16&quot;,
&quot;Linux&quot;, or a hexadecimal number between 0x00 and
0xff. Not all those numbers will yield usable results. For a
list of codes search <br>
the Internet for &quot;Partition Types&quot; or run fdisk
command &quot;L&quot;. <br>
If some other command causes the production of GPT, then the
appended partitions will be mentioned there too. <br>
The disk_path must provide the necessary data bytes at
commit time. An empty disk_path disables this feature for
the given partition number. <br>
With SUN Disk Label (selected by -boot_image any
sparc_label=): <br>
partition_number may be 2 to 8. Number 1 will always be the
ISO image. Partition start addresses are aligned to 320 KiB.
The type_code does not matter. Submit 0x0. <br>
Partition image name &quot;.&quot; causes the partition to
become a copy of the next lower valid one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Jigdo Template Extraction:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">From man genisoimage:
&quot;Jigdo is a tool to help in the distribution of large
files like CD and DVD images; see http://atterer.net/jigdo/
for more details. Debian CDs and DVD ISO <br>
images are published on the web in jigdo format to allow end
users to download them more efficiently.&quot; <br>
xorriso can produce a .jigdo and a .template file together
with a single-session ISO image. The .jigdo file contains
checksums and symbolic file addresses. The .template file
<br>
contains the compressed ISO image with reference tags
instead of the content bytes of the listed files. <br>
Input for this process are the normal arguments for a
xorriso session on a blank -outdev, and a .md5 file which
lists those data files which may be listed in the .jigdo
file and <br>
externally referenced in the .template file. Each designated
file is represented in the .md5 file by a single text line:
<br>
MD5 as 32 hex digits, 2 blanks, size as 12 decimal digits or
blanks, 2 blanks, symbolic file address <br>
The file address in an .md5 line has to bear the same
basename as the disk_path of the file which it shall match.
The directory path of the file address is decisive for
To=From <br>
mapping, not for file recognition. After To=From mapping,
the file address gets written into the .jigdo file. Jigdo
restore tools will convert these addresses into really <br>
reachable data source addresses from which they can read.
<br>
If the list of jigdo parameters is not empty, then xorriso
will refuse to write to non-blank targets, it will disable
multi-session emulation, and padding will be counted as part
<br>
of the ISO image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-jigdo parameter_name value <br>
Clear Jigdo Template Extraction parameter list or add a
parameter to that list. The alias names are the
corresponding genisoimage options. They are accepted as
parameter <br>
names as well. Especially they are recognized by the -as
mkisofs emulation command. <br>
Parameter clear with any value empties the whole list. No
.jigdo and .template file will be produced. <br>
template_path sets the disk_path for the .template file with
the holed and compressed ISO image copy. <br>
Alias: -jigdo-template <br>
jigdo_path sets the disk_path for the .jigdo file with the
checksums and download addresses for filling the holes in
.template. <br>
Alias: -jigdo-jigdo <br>
md5_path sets the disk_path where to find the .md5 input
file. <br>
Alias: -md5-list <br>
min_size sets the minimum size for a data file to be listed
in the .jigdo file and being a hole in the .template file.
<br>
Alias: -jigdo-min-file-size <br>
exclude adds a regular expression pattern which will get
compared with the absolute disk_path of any data file. A
match causes the file to stay in .template in any case. <br>
Alias: -jigdo-exclude <br>
demand_md5 adds a regular expression pattern which will get
compared with the absolute disk_path of any data file that
was not found in the .md5 list. A match causes a <br>
MISHAP event. <br>
Alias: -jigdo-force-md5 <br>
mapping adds a string pair of the form To=From to the
parameter list. If a data file gets listed in the .jigdo
file, then it is referred by the file address from its line
<br>
in the .md5 file. This file address gets checked whether it
begins with the From string. If so, then this string will be
replaced by the To string and a &rsquo;:&rsquo; character,
<br>
before it goes into the .jigdo file. The From string should
end by a &rsquo;/&rsquo; character. <br>
Alias: -jigdo-map <br>
compression chooses one of &quot;bzip2&quot; or
&quot;gzip&quot; for the compression of the template file.
The jigdo file is put out uncompressed. <br>
Alias: -jigdo-template-compress <br>
checksum_iso chooses one or more of &quot;md5&quot;,
&quot;sha1&quot;, &quot;sha256&quot;, &quot;sha512&quot; for
the auxiliary &quot;# Image Hex&quot; checksums in the jigdo
file. The value may e.g. look like <br>
&quot;md5,sha1,sha512&quot;. Value &quot;all&quot; chooses
all available algorithms. Note that MD5 stays always
enabled. <br>
Alias: -checksum_algorithm_iso <br>
checksum_template is like checksum_iso but for &quot;#
Template Hex&quot;. <br>
Alias: -checksum_algorithm_template</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Character sets:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File names are strings of
non-zero bytes with 8 bit each. Unfortunately the same byte
string may appear as different peculiar national characters
on differently nationalized <br>
terminals. The meanings of byte codes are defined in
character sets which have names. Shell command iconv -l
lists them. <br>
The file names on hard disk are assumed to be encoded by the
local character set which is also used for the communication
with the user. Byte codes 32 to 126 of the local <br>
character set must match the US-ASCII characters of the same
code. ISO-8859 and UTF-8 fulfill this demand. <br>
By default, xorriso uses the character set as told by shell
command &quot;locale&quot; with argument
&quot;charmap&quot;. This may be influenced by environment
variables LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE, or LANG <br>
and should match the expectations of the terminal. In some
situations it may be necessary to set it by command
-local_charset. <br>
Local character sets should not matter as long as only
english alphanumeric characters are used for file names or
as long as all writers and readers of the media use the same
<br>
local character set. Outside these constraints it may be
necessary to let xorriso convert byte codes from and to
other character sets. <br>
The Rock Ridge file names in ISO filesystems are assumed to
be encoded by the input character set. The Rock Ridge file
names which get written with ISO filesystems will be <br>
encoded by the output character set. <br>
The sets can be defined independently by commands
-in_charset and -out_charset. Normally one will have both
identical, if ever. Other than the local character set,
these two <br>
character sets may deviate from US-ASCII. <br>
The output character sets for Joliet and HFS+ are not
influenced by these commands. Joliet uses output character
set UCS-2 or UTF-16. HFS+ uses UTF-16. <br>
The default output charset is the local character set of the
terminal where xorriso runs. So by default no conversion
happens between local filesystem names and emerging Rock
<br>
Ridge names in the image. The situation stays ambiguous and
the reader has to riddle what character set was used. <br>
By command -auto_charset it is possible to attribute the
output charset name to the image. This makes the situation
unambiguous. But if your terminal character set does not
match <br>
the character set of the local file names, then this
attribute can become plainly wrong and cause problems at
read time. To prevent this it is necessary to check whether
the <br>
terminal properly displays all intended filenames. Check
especially the exotic national characters. <br>
To enforce recording of a particular character set name
without any conversion at image generation time, set
-charset and -local_charset to the desired name, and enable
<br>
-backslash_codes to avoid evil character display on your
terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-charset character_set_name <br>
Set the character set from which to convert file names when
loading an image and to which to convert when writing an
image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-local_charset
character_set_name <br>
Override the system assumption of the local character set
name. If this appears necessary, one should consider to set
-backslash_codes to &quot;on&quot; in order to avoid
dangerous <br>
binary codes being sent to the terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Exception processing:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since the tasks of xorriso are
manifold and prone to external influence, there may arise
the need for xorriso to report and handle problem events.
<br>
Those events get classified when they are detected by one of
the software modules and forwarded to reporting and
evaluation modules which decide about reactions. Event
classes <br>
are sorted by severity: <br>
&quot;NEVER&quot; The upper end of the severity spectrum.
<br>
&quot;ABORT&quot; The program is being aborted and on its
way to end. <br>
&quot;FATAL&quot; The main purpose of the run failed or an
important resource failed unexpectedly. <br>
&quot;FAILURE&quot; An important part of the job could not
be performed. <br>
&quot;MISHAP&quot; A FAILURE which can be tolerated during
ISO image generation. <br>
&quot;SORRY&quot; A less important part of the job could not
be performed. <br>
&quot;WARNING&quot; A situation is suspicious of being not
intended by the user. <br>
&quot;HINT&quot; A proposal to the user how to achieve
better results. <br>
&quot;NOTE&quot; A harmless information about noteworthy
circumstances. <br>
&quot;UPDATE&quot; A pacifier message during long running
operations. <br>
&quot;DEBUG&quot; A message which would only interest the
program developers. <br>
&quot;ALL&quot; The lower end of the severity spectrum.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-abort_on severity <br>
Set the severity threshold for events to abort the program.
<br>
Useful: &quot;NEVER&quot;, &quot;ABORT&quot;,
&quot;FATAL&quot;, &quot;FAILURE&quot; , &quot;MISHAP&quot;,
&quot;SORRY&quot; <br>
It may become necessary to abort the program anyway, despite
the setting by this command. Expect not many
&quot;ABORT&quot; events to be ignorable. <br>
A special property of this command is that it works
preemptive if given as program start argument. I.e. the
first -abort_on setting among the start arguments is in
effect <br>
already when the first operations of xorriso begin. Only
&quot;-abort_on&quot; with dash &quot;-&quot; is recognized
that way.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-return_with severity exit_value
<br>
Set the threshold and exit_value to be returned at program
end if no abort has happened. This is to allow xorriso to go
on after problems but to get a failure indicating <br>
exit value from the program, nevertheless. Useful is a value
lower than the -abort_on threshold, down to
&quot;WARNING&quot;. <br>
exit_value may be either 0 (indicating success to the
starter of the program) or a number between 32 and 63. Some
other exit_values are used by xorriso if it decides to <br>
abort the program run: <br>
1=abort due to external signal <br>
2=no program arguments given <br>
3=creation of xorriso main object failed <br>
4=failure to start libburnia-project.org libraries <br>
5=program abort during argument processing <br>
6=program abort during dialog processing</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-report_about severity <br>
Set the threshold for events to be reported. <br>
Useful: &quot;SORRY&quot;, &quot;WARNING&quot;,
&quot;HINT&quot;, &quot;NOTE&quot;, &quot;UPDATE&quot;,
&quot;DEBUG&quot;, &quot;ALL&quot; <br>
Regardless what is set by -report_about, messages get always
reported if they reach the severity threshold of -abort_on .
<br>
Event messages are sent to the info channel &quot;I&quot;
which is usually stderr but may be influenced by command
-pkt_output. Info messages which belong to no event get <br>
attributed severity &quot;NOTE&quot;. <br>
A special property of this command is that the first
-report_about setting among the start arguments is in effect
already when the first operations of xorriso begin. Only
<br>
&quot;-report_about&quot; with dash &quot;-&quot; is
recognized that way.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-signal_handling mode <br>
Control the installation of a signal handler which shall
react on external signals (e.g. from program
&quot;kill&quot; or from keys Ctrl+C) or on signals caused
by severe program <br>
errors. <br>
Mode &quot;on&quot; is the default. It uses the signal
handler of libburn which produces ugly messages but puts
much effort in releasing optical drives before xorriso ends.
<br>
Mode &quot;off&quot; as first -signal_handling among the
start arguments prevents all own signal precautions of
xorriso. Inherited signal handler settings stay as they are.
<br>
It works like &quot;sig_dfl&quot; if given after other
signal handling was already established at program start.
<br>
Mode &quot;sig_dfl&quot; uses the system provided default
handling of signals, which is normally a sudden abort of the
program. To prevent stuck drives, the libburn handler is
used <br>
during burning, blanking, and formatting on MMC drives. <br>
Mode &quot;sig_ign&quot; tries to ignore as many signal
types as possible. This imposes the risk that xorriso
refuses to end until externally kill -9 if performed. kill
-9 then <br>
imposes the risk that the drive is left in unusable state
and needs poweroff to be reset. So during burning, blanking,
and formatting wait for at least their normal run <br>
time before killing externally. <br>
A special property of this command is that the first
-signal_handling setting among the start arguments is in
effect already when the first operations of xorriso begin.
<br>
Only &quot;-signal_handling&quot; with dash &quot;-&quot; is
recognized that way.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-error_behavior occasion
behavior <br>
Control the program behavior at problem event occasions. For
now this applies to occasions &quot;image_loading&quot;
which is given while an image tree is read from the input
<br>
device, and to &quot;file_extraction&quot; which is given
with osirrox commands like -extract. <br>
With &quot;image_loading&quot; there are three behaviors
available: <br>
&quot;best_effort&quot; goes on with reading after events
with severity below FAILURE if the threshold of command
-abort_on allows this. <br>
&quot;failure&quot; aborts image tree reading on first event
of at least SORRY. It issues an own FAILURE event. This is
the default. <br>
&quot;fatal&quot; acts like &quot;failure&quot; but issues
the own event as FATAL. <br>
With occasion &quot;file_extraction&quot; there are three
behaviors: <br>
&quot;keep&quot; maintains incompletely extracted files on
disk. This is the default. <br>
&quot;delete&quot; removes files which encountered errors
during content extraction. <br>
&quot;best_effort&quot; starts a revovery attempt by means
of -extract_cut if the file content stems from the loaded
ISO image and is not filtered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Dialog mode control:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dialog
&quot;on&quot;|&quot;off&quot;|&quot;single_line&quot; <br>
Enable or disable to enter dialog mode after all program
arguments are processed. In dialog mode input lines get
prompted via readline or from stdin. <br>
If no -abort_on severity was set when dialog starts, then
&quot;NEVER&quot; is set to avoid abort in most cases of
wrong input or other problems. Before dialog begins, the
default <br>
is &quot;FAILURE&quot; which e.g. aborts on unknown
commands. <br>
Mode &quot;on&quot; supports input of newline characters
within quotation marks and line continuation by trailing
backslash outside quotation marks. Mode
&quot;single_line&quot; does not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-page length width <br>
Describe terminal to the text pager. See also above,
paragraph Result pager. <br>
If parameter length is nonzero then the user gets prompted
after that number of terminal lines. Zero length disables
paging. <br>
Parameter width is the number of characters per terminal
line. It is used to compute the number of terminal lines
which get occupied by an output line. A usual terminal <br>
width is 80.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-use_readline
&quot;on&quot;|&quot;off&quot; <br>
If &quot;on&quot; then use readline for dialog. Else use
plain stdin. <br>
See also above, paragraph Dialog, Readline, Result
pager.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-reassure
&quot;on&quot;|&quot;tree&quot;|&quot;off&quot; <br>
If &quot;on&quot; then ask the user for &quot;y&quot; or
&quot;n&quot;: <br>
before deleting or overwriting any file in the ISO image,
<br>
before overwriting any disk file during restore operations,
<br>
before rolling back pending image changes, <br>
before committing image changes to media, <br>
before changing the input drive, <br>
before blanking or formatting media, <br>
before ending the program. <br>
With setting &quot;tree&quot; the reassuring prompt will
appear for an eventual directory only once and not for each
file in its whole subtree. <br>
Setting &quot;off&quot; silently kills any kind of image
file object and performs above irrevocable actions. <br>
To really produce user prompts, command -dialog needs to be
set to &quot;on&quot;. Note that the prompt does not appear
in situations where file removal is forbidden by command
<br>
-overwrite. -reassure only imposes an additional curb for
removing existing file objects. <br>
Be aware that file objects get deleted from the ISO image
immediately after confirmation. They are gone even if the
running command gets aborted and its desired effect <br>
gets revoked. In case of severe mess-up, consider to use
-rollback to revoke the whole session.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Drive and media related inquiry
actions:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-devices <br>
Show list of available MMC drives with the addresses of
their libburn standard device files. <br>
This is only possible when no ISO image changes are pending.
After this command was executed, there is no drive current
and no image loaded. <br>
In order to be visible, a device has to offer rw-permissions
with its libburn standard device file. Thus it might be only
the superuser who is able to see all drives. <br>
Drives which are occupied by other processes get not
shown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-device_links <br>
Like -devices, but presenting the drives with addresses of
symbolic links which point to the actual device files. <br>
Modern GNU/Linux systems may shuffle drive addresses from
boot to boot. The udev daemon is supposed to create links
which always point to the same drive, regardless of <br>
its system address. The command -device_links shows the
addresses of such links if they begin by
&quot;/dev/dvd&quot; or &quot;/dev/cd&quot;. Precedence is:
&quot;dvdrw&quot;, &quot;cdrw&quot;, &quot;dvd&quot;,
&quot;cdrom&quot;, <br>
&quot;cd&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-toc <br>
Show media specific tables of content. This is the session
history of the medium, not the ISO image directory tree.
<br>
In case of overwriteable media holding a valid ISO image, it
may happen that only a single session gets shown. But if the
first session on the overwriteable media was <br>
written by xorriso then a complete session history can be
emulated. <br>
A drive which is incapable of writing may show any media as
CD-ROM or DVD-ROM with only one or two sessions on it. The
last of these sessions is supposed to be the most <br>
recent real session then. <br>
Some read-only drives and media show no usable session
history at all. Command -rom_toc_scan might help. <br>
If input device and output device are both acquired and not
the same, then both tables-of-content get shown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-toc_of
&quot;in&quot;|&quot;out&quot;|&quot;all&quot;[&quot;:short&quot;]
<br>
Like command -toc but explicitly choosing which
drive&rsquo;s table-of-content to show. &quot;in&quot; shows
-indev or -dev, &quot;out&quot; shows -outdev or -dev,
&quot;all&quot; shows the same as -toc. <br>
If &quot;:short&quot; is appended to the drive choosing
word, then only a short summary of drive state and medium
content is printed. <br>
As further difference to -toc, this command does not emit
FAILURE events if the desired drive is not acquired.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mount_cmd drive entity id path
<br>
Emit an appropriate command line for mounting the ISO
session indicated by drive, entity and id. The result will
be different on GNU/Linux and on FreeBSD or NetBSD. <br>
drive can be &quot;indev&quot; or &quot;outdev&quot; to
indicate already acquired drives, or it can be the path of a
not yet acquired drive. Prefix &quot;stdio:&quot; for
non-MMC drives is not <br>
mandatory. <br>
entity must be either &quot;sbsector&quot; with the
superblock sector address as id, or &quot;track&quot; with a
track number as id, or &quot;session&quot; with a session
number, or &quot;volid&quot; with a <br>
search pattern for the volume id, or &quot;auto&quot; with
any text as id. <br>
path will be used as mount point and must already exist as a
directory on disk. <br>
The command gets printed to the result channel. See command
-mount for direct execution of this command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mount_opts option[:option...]
<br>
Set options which influence -mount and -mount_cmd. Currently
there is only option &quot;exclusive&quot; which is default
and its counterpart &quot;shared&quot;. The latter causes
xorriso not <br>
to give up the affected drive with command -mount. On
GNU/Linux it adds mount option &quot;loop&quot; which may
enable mounting of several sessions of the same block device
at the <br>
same time. One should not write to a mounted optical medium,
of course. Take care to umount all sessions before
ejecting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-session_string drive entity id
format <br>
Print to the result channel a text which gets composed
according to format and the parameters of the addressed
session. <br>
Formats &quot;linux:&quot;path or &quot;freebsd:&quot;path
produce the output of -mount_cmd for the given operating
systems. <br>
In other texts xorriso will substitute the following
parameter names. An optional prefix &quot;string:&quot; will
be removed. <br>
&quot;%device%&quot; will be substituted by the mountable
device path of the drive address. <br>
&quot;%sbsector%&quot; will be substituted by the session
start sector. <br>
&quot;%track%&quot;, &quot;%session%&quot;,
&quot;%volid%&quot; will be substituted by track number,
session number, or volume id of the depicted session.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-print_size <br>
Print the foreseeable consumption of 2048 byte blocks by
next -commit. This can last a while as a -commit gets
prepared and only in last moment is revoked by this command.
<br>
The result depends on several settings and also on the kind
of output device. If no -jidgo options are set and not
command -as &quot;mkisofs&quot; was used, then -padding (300
kB <br>
by default) is not counted as part of the image size. <br>
If an El Torito boot image file is already depicted, then
command -print_size automatically executes -boot_image
&quot;any&quot; &quot;next&quot;. This means that the
properties of that boot <br>
image cannot be edited by subsequent commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-tell_media_space <br>
Print available space on the output medium and the free
space after subtracting already foreseeable consumption by
next -commit. <br>
Note that the title of the prediction &quot;After commit
:&quot; is misleading. It is rather the space that may still
be filled in this session without making the next -commit
fail <br>
from medium overflow. <br>
The free space after the next -commit might be smaller by
several MB. This depends on medium type, number of recorded
sessions, and drive habits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pvd_info <br>
Print various ID strings and timestamps which can be found
in loaded ISO images. Some of the IDs may be changed by
commands like -volid or -publisher. For these IDs <br>
-pvd_info reports what would be written with the next
-commit. The timestamps get not automatically propagated
from loaded image to newly written image. The ones for new
<br>
images may be set by command -volume_date. See there for the
meaning of the particular timestamps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-report_el_torito mode <br>
With mode plain print a report about the information found
in the El Torito boot catalog of the loaded ISO image. <br>
With mode help print a text which explains the meaning of
the lines put out by &quot;plain&quot;. <br>
Mode cmd tries to print the xorriso commands which are
necessary to produce the found boot equipment: disk
identifiers, El Torito boot images, and System Area. Disk
<br>
identifiers are strings which the booting operating system
might use to find the ISO filesystem from where it comes.
Currently known is the use of volume id and <br>
modification date. <br>
The intended use case is modification of the filesystem by
having -indev and -outdev pointing to different images or
drives. The result might be insufficient, if the <br>
found equipment cannot be produced by xorriso. Various SORRY
events may arise in this case, but it is not guaranteed that
xorriso recognizes all its insufficiencies. <br>
Mode as_mkisofs tries to print the xorriso -as mkisofs
options, which are necessary to produce the found equipment.
The intended use case is to use the mounted filesystem <br>
as input tree together with the printed options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-report_system_area mode <br>
With mode plain print a report about the information found
in the System Area of the loaded ISO image. The report
consists of zero to many lines with a header text, a <br>
colon, and information text. <br>
With mode help print a text which explains the meaning of
the lines put out by &quot;plain&quot;. You probably will
have to look for more documentation which explains the
technical <br>
details of the mentioned boot facilities. <br>
Modes cmd and as_mkisofs work like with command
-report_el_torito. See above. <br>
With mode gpt_disk_guid print the GPT disk GUID of the
loaded ISO in RFC 4122 text format to result channel. It is
not considered an error if no GPT is present. In this <br>
case nothing is printed to result channel. <br>
With mode gpt_crc_of:disk_path read up to 32 KiB from the
disk file with the path given after the colon. Compute the
GPT compliant CRC number and print it to the result <br>
channel. The number is shown like &quot;0x690fd979&quot;.
The special disk_path &quot;-&quot; causes reading from
standard input. <br>
With mode make_guid print a pseudo-random GUID in RFC 4122
text format to result channel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Navigation in ISO image and disk
filesystem:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-cd iso_rr_path <br>
Change the current working directory in the ISO image. This
is prepended to iso_rr_paths which do not begin with
&rsquo;/&rsquo;. <br>
It is possible to set the working directory to a path which
does not exist yet in the ISO image. The necessary parent
directories will be created when the first file <br>
object is inserted into that virtual directory. Use -mkdir
if you want to enforce the existence of the directory
already at first insertion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-cdx disk_path <br>
Change the current working directory in the local
filesystem. To be prepended to disk_paths which do not begin
with &rsquo;/&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pwd <br>
Tell the current working directory in the ISO image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pwdx <br>
Tell the current working directory in the local
filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ls iso_rr_pattern [***] <br>
List files in the ISO image which match shell patterns (i.e.
with wildcards &rsquo;*&rsquo; &rsquo;?&rsquo;
&rsquo;[a-z]&rsquo;). If a pattern does not begin with
&rsquo;/&rsquo; then it is compared with addresses <br>
relative to -cd. <br>
Directories are listed by their content rather than as
single file item. <br>
Pattern expansion may be disabled by command
-iso_rr_pattern.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-lsd iso_rr_pattern [***] <br>
Like -ls but listing directories as themselves and not by
their content. This resembles shell command ls -d.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-lsl iso_rr_pattern [***] <br>
Like -ls but also list some of the file attributes. The
output format resembles shell command ls -ln. <br>
File type &rsquo;e&rsquo; indicates the El Torito boot
catalog. <br>
If the file has non-trivial ACL, then a &rsquo;+&rsquo; is
appended to the permission info. If the file is hidden, then
&rsquo;I&rsquo; for &quot;iso_rr&quot;, &rsquo;J&rsquo; for
&quot;joliet&quot;, &rsquo;A&rsquo; for &quot;hfsplus&quot;,
&rsquo;H&rsquo; for <br>
multiple hiding gets appended. Together with ACL it is
&rsquo;i&rsquo;, &rsquo;j&rsquo;, &rsquo;a&rsquo;,
&rsquo;h&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-lsdl iso_rr_pattern [***] <br>
Like -lsd but also list some of the file attributes. The
output format resembles shell command ls -dln.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-lsx disk_pattern [***] <br>
List files in the local filesystem which match shell
patterns. Patterns which do not begin with &rsquo;/&rsquo;
are used relative to -cdx. <br>
Directories are listed by their content rather than as
single file item. <br>
Pattern expansion may be disabled by command
-disk_pattern.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-lsdx disk_pattern [***] <br>
Like -lsx but listing directories as themselves and not by
their content. This resembles shell command ls -d.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-lslx disk_pattern [***] <br>
Like -lsx but also listing some of the file attributes.
Output format resembles shell command ls -ln.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-lsdlx disk_pattern [***] <br>
Like -lsdx but also listing some of the file attributes.
Output format resembles shell command ls -dln.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-getfacl iso_rr_pattern [***]
<br>
Print the access permissions of the given files in the ISO
image using the format of shell command getfacl. If a file
has no ACL then it gets fabricated from the -chmod <br>
settings. A file may have a real ACL if it was introduced
into the ISO image while command -acl was set to
&quot;on&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-getfacl_r iso_rr_pattern [***]
<br>
Like -gefacl but listing recursively the whole file trees
underneath eventual directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-getfattr iso_rr_pattern [***]
<br>
Print the xattr of the given files in the ISO image. If a
file has no such xattr then noting is printed for it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-getfattr_r iso_rr_pattern [***]
<br>
Like -gefattr but listing recursively the whole file trees
underneath eventual directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-du iso_rr_pattern [***] <br>
Recursively list size of directories and files in the ISO
image which match one of the patterns. similar to shell
command du -k.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dus iso_rr_pattern [***] <br>
List size of directories and files in the ISO image which
match one of the patterns. Similar to shell command du
-sk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dux disk_pattern [***] <br>
Recursively list size of directories and files in the local
filesystem which match one of the patterns. Similar to shell
command du -k.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dusx disk_pattern [***] <br>
List size of directories and files in the local filesystem
which match one of the patterns. Similar to shell command du
-sk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-findx disk_path [-name pattern]
[-type t] [-exec action [params]] -- <br>
Like -find but operating on local filesystem and not on the
ISO image. This is subject to the settings of -follow. <br>
-findx accepts the same -type parameters as -find.
Additionally it recognizes type &quot;mountpoint&quot; (or
&quot;m&quot;) which matches subdirectories which reside on
a different device <br>
than their parent. It never matches the disk_path given as
start address for -findx. <br>
-findx accepts the -exec actions as does -find. But except
the following few actions it will always perform action
&quot;echo&quot;. <br>
in_iso reports the path if its counterpart exists in the ISO
image. For this the disk_path of the -findx command gets
replaced by the iso_rr_path given as parameter. <br>
E.g.: -findx /home/thomas -exec in_iso /thomas_on_cd -- <br>
not_in_iso reports the path if its counterpart does not
exist in the ISO image. The report format is the same as
with command -compare. <br>
add_missing iso_rr_path_start adds the counterpart if it
does not yet exist in the ISO image and marks it for
&quot;rm_merge&quot; as non-removable. <br>
E.g.: -findx /home/thomas -exec add_missing /thomas_on_cd --
<br>
is_full_in_iso reports if the counterpart in the ISO image
contains files. To be used with -type &quot;m&quot; to
report mount points. <br>
empty_iso_dir deletes all files from the counterpart in the
ISO image. To be used with -type &quot;m&quot; to truncate
mount points. <br>
estimate_size prints a lower and an upper estimation of the
number of blocks which the found files together will occupy
in the emerging ISO image. This does not account <br>
for the superblock, for the directories in the -findx path,
or for image padding. <br>
list_extattr mode prints a script to the result channel,
which would use FreeBSD command setextattr to set the
file&rsquo;s xattr name-value pairs of user namespace. See
-find <br>
for a description of parameter mode. <br>
E.g. -exec list_extattr e --</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-compare disk_path iso_rr_path
<br>
Compare attributes and eventual data file content of a
fileobject in the local filesystem with a file object in the
ISO image. The iso_rr_path may well point to an image <br>
file object which is not yet committed, i.e. of which the
data content still resides in the local filesystem. Such
data content is prone to externally caused changes. <br>
If iso_rr_path is empty then disk_path is used as path in
the ISO image too. <br>
Differing attributes are reported in detail, differing
content is summarized. Both to the result channel. In case
of no differences no result lines are emitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-compare_r disk_path iso_rr_path
<br>
Like -compare but working recursively. I.e. all file objects
below both addresses get compared whether they have
counterparts below the other address and whether both <br>
counterparts match.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-compare_l disk_prefix
iso_rr_prefix disk_path [***] <br>
Perform -compare_r with each of the disk_path parameters.
iso_rr_path will be composed from disk_path by replacing
disk_prefix by iso_rr_prefix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-show_stream iso_rr_path [***]
<br>
Display the content stream chain of data files in the ISO
image. The chain consists of the iso_rr_name and one or more
streams, separated by &quot; &lt; &quot; marks. A stream
<br>
description consists of one or more texts, separated by
&quot;:&quot; characters. The first text tells the stream
type, the following ones, if ever, describe its individual
<br>
properties. Frequently used types are: <br>
disk:&rsquo;disk_path&rsquo; for local filesystem objects.
<br>
image:&rsquo;iso_rr_path&rsquo; for ISO image file objects.
<br>
cout:&rsquo;disk_path offset count&rsquo; for -cut_out
files. <br>
extf:&rsquo;filter_name&rsquo; for external filters. <br>
Example: <br>
&rsquo;/abc/xyz.gz&rsquo; &lt; extf:&rsquo;gzip&rsquo; &lt;
disk:&rsquo;/home/me/x&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-show_stream_r iso_rr_path [***]
<br>
Like -show_stream but working recursively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Evaluation of readability and
recovery:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is not uncommon that optical
media produce read errors. The reasons may be various and
get obscured by error correction which is performed by the
drives and based on extra <br>
data on the media. If a drive returns data then one can
quite trust that they are valid. But at some degree of read
problems the correction will fail and the drive is supposed
to <br>
indicate error. <br>
xorriso can scan a medium for readable data blocks, classify
them according to their read speed, save them to a file, and
keep track of successfully saved blocks for further <br>
tries on the same medium. <br>
By command -md5 checksums may get recorded with data files
and whole sessions. These checksums are reachable only via
indev and a loaded image. They work independently of the
<br>
media type and can detect transmission errors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-check_media [option [option
...]] -- <br>
Try to read data blocks from the indev drive, optionally
copy them to a disk file, and finally report about the
encountered quality. Several options may be used to modify
<br>
the default behavior. <br>
The parameters given with this command override the default
settings which may have been changed by command
-check_media_defaults. See there for a description of
available <br>
options. <br>
The result list tells intervals of 2 KiB blocks with start
address, number of blocks and quality. Qualities which begin
with &quot;+&quot; are supposed to be valid readable data.
<br>
Qualities with &quot;-&quot; are unreadable or corrupted
data. &quot;0&quot; indicates qualities which are not
covered by the check run or are regularly allowed to be
unreadable (e.g. gaps <br>
between tracks). <br>
Alternatively it is possible to report damaged files rather
than blocks. <br>
If -md5 is &quot;on&quot; then the default mode what=tracks
looks out for libisofs checksum tags for the ISO session
data and checks them against the checksums computed from the
<br>
data stream.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-check_media_defaults [option
[option ...]] -- <br>
Preset options for runs of -check_media, -extract_cut and
best_effort file extraction. Options given with -check_media
will override the preset options. -extract_cut will <br>
override some options automatically. <br>
An option consists of a keyword, a &quot;=&quot; character,
and a value. Options may override each other. So their
sequence matters. <br>
The default setting at program start is: <br>
use=indev what=tracks min_lba=-1 max_lba=-1 retry=default
<br>
time_limit=28800 item_limit=100000 data_to=&rsquo;&rsquo;
event=ALL <br>
abort_file=/var/opt/xorriso/do_abort_check_media <br>
sector_map=&rsquo;&rsquo; map_with_volid=off patch_lba0=off
report=blocks <br>
bad_limit=invalid slow_limit=1.0 chunk_size=0s
async_chunks=0 <br>
Option &quot;reset=now&quot; restores these startup
defaults. <br>
Non-default options are: <br>
report=&quot;files&quot; lists the files which use damaged
blocks (not with use=outdev). The format is like with find
-exec report_damage. Note that a MD5 session mismatch marks
<br>
all files of the session as damaged. If finer distinction is
desired, perform -md5 off before -check_media. <br>
report=&quot;blocks_files&quot; first lists damaged blocks
and then affected files. <br>
use=&quot;outdev&quot; reads from the output drive instead
of the input drive. This avoids loading the ISO image tree
from media. <br>
use=&quot;sector_map&quot; does not read any media but loads
the file given by option sector_map= and processes this
virtual outcome. <br>
what=&quot;disc&quot; scans the payload range of a medium
without respecting track gaps. <br>
what=&quot;image&quot; similar to &quot;disc&quot;, but
restricts scanning to the range of the ISO 9660 image, if
present. <br>
min_lba=limit omits all blocks with addresses lower than
limit. <br>
max_lba=limit switches to what=disc and omits all blocks
above limit. <br>
chunk_size=size sets the number of bytes to be read in one
low-level read operation. This gets rounded down to full
blocks of 2048 bytes. 0 means automatic size. <br>
retry=&quot;on&quot; forces read retries with minimal
senseful chunk size when the normal read chunk produces a
read error. This size is 1s with CD and stdio files, 16s
with DVD (1 <br>
ECC Block), and 32s with BD (1 Cluster). By default, retries
are only enabled with CD media. &quot;retry=off&quot;
forbits retries for all media types. <br>
abort_file=disk_path gives the path of the file which may
abort a scan run. Abort happens if the file exists and its
mtime is not older than the start time of the run. Use <br>
shell command &quot;touch&quot; to trigger this. Other than
an aborted program run, this will report the tested and
untested blocks and go on with running xorriso. <br>
time_limit=seconds gives the number of seconds after which
the scan shall be aborted. This is useful for unattended
scanning of media which may else overwork the drive in <br>
its effort to squeeze out some readable blocks. Abort may be
delayed by the drive gnawing on the last single read
operation. Value -1 means unlimited time. <br>
item_limit=number gives the number of report list items
after which to abort. Value -1 means unlimited item number.
<br>
data_to=disk_path copies the valid blocks to the given file.
<br>
event=severity sets the given severity for a problem event
which shall be issued at the end of a check run if data
blocks were unreadable or failed to match recorded MD5 <br>
checksums. Severity &quot;ALL&quot; disables this event.
<br>
sector_map=disk_path tries to read the file given by
disk_path as sector bitmap and to store such a map file
after the scan run. The bitmap tells which blocks have been
<br>
read successfully in previous runs. It is the persistent
memory for several scans on the same medium, even with
intermediate eject, in order to collect readable blocks <br>
whenever the drive is lucky enough to produce them. The
stored file contains a human readable TOC of tracks and
their start block addresses, followed by binary bitmap <br>
data. <br>
By default, untested blocks are not considered bad, but
rather as intentionally unread. If you expect time_limit= or
item_limit= to abort the run, then consider to use <br>
bad_limit=&quot;untested&quot;. <br>
map_with_volid=&quot;on&quot; examines tracks whether they
are ISO images and prints their volume IDs into the human
readable TOC of sector_map=. <br>
patch_lba0=&quot;on&quot; transfers within the data_to= file
a copy of the currently loaded session head to the start of
that file and patches it to be valid at that position. This
<br>
makes the loaded session the last valid session of the image
file when it gets mounted or loaded as stdio: drive. New
sessions will be appended after this last session and <br>
will overwrite any sessions which have followed it. <br>
patch_lba0=&quot;force&quot; performs
patch_lba0=&quot;on&quot; even if xorriso believes that the
copied data are not valid. <br>
patch_lba0= may also bear a number. If it is 32 or higher it
is taken as start address of the session to be copied. In
this case it is not necessary to have an -indev and <br>
a loaded image. &quot;:force&quot; may be appended after the
number. <br>
bad_limit=threshold sets the highest quality which shall be
considered as damage. Choose one of &quot;good&quot;,
&quot;md5_match&quot;, &quot;slow&quot;,
&quot;partial&quot;, &quot;valid&quot;,
&quot;untested&quot;, &quot;invalid&quot;, <br>
&quot;tao_end&quot;, &quot;off_track&quot;,
&quot;md5_mismatch&quot;, &quot;unreadable&quot;. <br>
&quot;valid&quot; and &quot;invalid&quot; are qualities
imported from a sector_map file. &quot;tao_end&quot; and
&quot;off_track&quot; are intentionally not readable, but
not bad either. &quot;partial&quot; are blocks <br>
retrieved from a partially readable chunk. They are supposed
to be ok but stem from a suspicious neighborhood. <br>
&quot;md5_match&quot; and &quot;md5_mismatch&quot; regions
overlap with regions of other quality. <br>
slow_limit=threshold sets the time threshold for a single
read chunk to be considered slow. This may be a fractional
number like 0.1 or 1.5. <br>
async_chunks=number enables asynchronous MD5 processing if
number is 2 or larger. In this case the given number of read
chunks is allocated as fifo buffer. On very fast <br>
MMC drives try: chunk_size=64s async_chunks=16.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-check_md5 severity iso_rr_path
[***] <br>
Compare the data content of the given files in the loaded
image with their recorded MD5 checksums, if there are any.
In case of any mismatch an event of the given severity <br>
is issued. It may then be handled by appropriate settings of
commands -abort_on or -return_with which both can cause
non-zero exit values of the program run. Severity ALL <br>
suppresses that event. <br>
This command reports match and mismatch of data files to the
result channel. Non-data files cause NOTE events. There will
also be UPDATE events from data reading. <br>
If no iso_rr_path is given then the whole loaded session is
compared with its MD5 sum. Be aware that this covers only
one session and not the whole image if there are <br>
older sessions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-check_md5_r severity
iso_rr_path [***] <br>
Like -check_md5 but checking all data files underneath the
given paths. Only mismatching data files will be
reported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">osirrox ISO-to-disk restore
commands:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normally xorriso only writes to
disk files which were given as stdio: pseudo-drives or as
log files. But its alter ego osirrox is able to extract file
objects from ISO images <br>
and to create, overwrite, or delete file objects on disk.
<br>
Disk file exclusions by -not_mgt, -not_leaf, -not_paths
apply. If disk file objects already exist then the settings
of -overwrite and -reassure apply. But -overwrite
&quot;on&quot; only <br>
triggers the behavior of -overwrite &quot;nondir&quot;. I.e.
directories cannot be deleted. <br>
Access permissions of files in the ISO image do not restrict
restoring. The directory permissions on disk have to allow
rwx.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-osirrox setting[:option:...]
<br>
Setting &quot;off&quot; disables disk filesystem
manipulations. This is the default unless the program was
started with leafname &quot;osirrox&quot;. Elsewise the
capability to restore files <br>
can be enabled explicitly by -osirrox &quot;on&quot;. It can
be irrevocably disabled by -osirrox &quot;banned&quot;. <br>
The setting &quot;blocked&quot; is like &quot;off&quot;. But
it can only be revoked by setting &quot;unblock&quot;, which
elsewise is like &quot;on&quot;. This can be used to curb
command scripts which might use <br>
&quot;on&quot; undesiredly. <br>
To enable restoring of special files by
&quot;device_files&quot; is potentially dangerous. The
meaning of the number st_rdev (see man 2 stat) depends much
on the operating system. <br>
Best is to restore device files only to the same system from
where they were copied. If not enabled, device files in the
ISO image are ignored during restore operations. <br>
Due to a bug of previous versions, device files from
previous sessions might have been altered to major=0,
minor=1. So this combination does not get restored. <br>
Option &quot;concat_split_on&quot; is default. It enables
restoring of split file directories as data files if the
directory contains a complete collection of -cut_out part
files. <br>
With option &quot;concat_split_off&quot; such directories
are handled like any other ISO image directory. <br>
Option &quot;auto_chmod_off&quot; is default. If
&quot;auto_chmod_on&quot; is set then access restrictions
for disk directories get circumvented if those directories
are owned by the <br>
effective user who runs xorriso. This happens by temporarily
granting rwx permission to the owner. <br>
Option &quot;sort_lba_on&quot; may improve read performance
with optical drives. It can restore large numbers of hard
links without exhausting -temp_mem_limit. It does not
preserve <br>
directory mtime and it needs -osirrox option auto_chmod_on
in order to extract directories which offer no write
permission. Default is &quot;sort_lba_off&quot;. <br>
Option &quot;o_excl_on&quot; is the default unless the
program was started with leafname &quot;osirrox&quot;. On
GNU/Linux it tries to avoid using drives which are mounted
or in use by other <br>
libburn programs. Option &quot;o_excl_off&quot; on GNU/Linux
enables access to such drives. Drives which get acquired
while &quot;o_excl_off&quot; will refuse to get blanked,
formatted, <br>
written, or ejected. But be aware that even harmless
inquiries can spoil ongoing burns of CD-R[W] and DVD-R[W].
<br>
Option &quot;strict_acl_off&quot; is default. It tolerates
on FreeBSD the presence of directory &quot;default&quot;
ACLs in the ISO image. With &quot;strict_acl_on&quot; these
GNU/Linux ACLs cause on <br>
FreeBSD a FAILURE event during restore with -acl
&quot;on&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-extract iso_rr_path disk_path
<br>
Copy the file objects at and underneath iso_rr_path to their
corresponding addresses at and underneath disk_path. This is
the inverse of -map or -update_r. <br>
If iso_rr_path is a directory and disk_path is an existing
directory then both trees will be merged. Directory
attributes get extracted only if the disk directory is newly
<br>
created by the copy operation. Disk files get removed only
if they are to be replaced by file objects from the ISO
image. <br>
As many attributes as possible are copied together with
restored file objects.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-extract_single iso_rr_path
disk_path <br>
Like -extract, but if iso_rr_path is a directory then its
sub tree gets not restored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-extract_l iso_rr_prefix
disk_prefix iso_rr_path [***] <br>
Perform -extract with each of the iso_rr_path parameters.
disk_path will be composed from iso_rr_path by replacing
iso_rr_prefix by disk_prefix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-extract_cut iso_rr_path
byte_offset byte_count disk_path <br>
Copy a byte interval from a data file out of an ISO image
into a newly created disk file. The main purpose for this is
to offer a way of handling large files if they are <br>
not supported by mount -t iso9660 or if the target disk
filesystem cannot store large files. <br>
If the data bytes of iso_rr_path are stored in the loaded
ISO image, and no filter is applied, and byte_offset is a
multiple of 2048, then a special run of -check_media is <br>
performed. It may be quicker and more rugged than the
general reading method.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-cpx iso_rr_path [***] disk_path
<br>
Copy single leaf file objects from the ISO image to the
address given by disk_path. If more then one iso_rr_path is
given then disk_path must be a directory or <br>
non-existent. In the latter case it gets created and the
extracted files get installed in it with the same leafnames.
<br>
Missing directory components in disk_path will get created,
if possible. <br>
Directories are allowed as iso_rr_path only with -osirrox
&quot;concat_split_on&quot; and only if they actually
represent a complete collection of -cut_out split file
parts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-cpax iso_rr_path [***]
disk_path <br>
Like -cpx but restoring mtime, atime as in ISO image and
trying to set ownership and group as in ISO image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-cp_rx iso_rr_path [***]
disk_path <br>
Like -cpx but also extracting whole directory trees from the
ISO image. <br>
The resulting disk paths are determined as with shell
command cp -r : If disk_path is an existing directory then
the trees will be inserted or merged underneath this <br>
directory and will keep their leaf names. The ISO directory
&quot;/&quot; has no leaf name and thus gets mapped directly
to disk_path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-cp_rax iso_rr_path [***]
disk_path <br>
Like -cp_rx but restoring mtime, atime as in ISO image and
trying to set ownership and group as in ISO image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-paste_in iso_rr_path disk_path
byte_offset byte_count <br>
Read the content of a ISO data file and write it into a data
file on disk beginning at the byte_offset. Write at most
byte_count bytes. This is the inverse of command <br>
-cut_out.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-concat mode [target | lim prog
[args [...]] lim] iso_rr_path [***] <br>
Copy the data content of one or more data files of the ISO
image into a disk file object, into a file descriptor, or
start a program and copy the data into its standard <br>
input. The latter is subject to the security restrictions
for external filters. <br>
Modes overwrite and append write into the target which is
given by the second parameter. This may be the path to a
disk file object, or &quot;-&quot; which means standard
output, or <br>
a text of the form /dev/fd/number, where number is an open
file descriptor (e.g. standard error is /dev/fd/2). An
existing target file is not removed before writing <br>
begins. If it is not able to take content data, then this
command fails. Mode overwrite truncates regular data files
to 0 size before writing into them. Example: <br>
-concat append /home/me/accumulated_text /my/iso/text --</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mode pipe expects as second
parameter a delimiter word which shall mark the end of the
program argument list. The third argument is the disk_path
to the program. It must <br>
contain at least one &rsquo;/&rsquo;. $PATH is not applied.
Further parameters up to the announced delimiter word are
used as arguments with the program start. Example: <br>
-iso_rr_pattern on -concat pipe + /usr/bin/wc +
&quot;/my/iso/files*&quot; --</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The further parameters in all
modes are the iso_rr_paths of data files. Their content gets
concatenated in the copy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mount drive entity id path <br>
Produce the same line as -mount_cmd and then execute it as
external program run after giving up the depicted drive. See
also -mount_opts. This demands -osirrox to be <br>
enabled and normally will succeed only for the superuser.
For safety reasons the mount program is only executed if it
is reachable as /bin/mount or /sbin/mount.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Command compatibility
emulations:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Writing of ISO 9660 on CD is
traditionally done by program mkisofs as ISO 9660 image
producer and cdrecord as burn program. xorriso does not
strive for their comprehensive <br>
emulation. Nevertheless it is ready to perform some of its
core tasks under control of commands which in said programs
trigger comparable actions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-as personality option [options]
-- <br>
Perform the variable length option list as sparse emulation
of the program depicted by the personality word.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Personality &quot;mkisofs&quot;
accepts the options listed with: <br>
-as mkisofs -help -- <br>
Among them: -R (always on), -r, -J, -o, -M, -C, -dir-mode,
-file-mode, -path-list, -m, -exclude-list, -f, -print-size,
-pad, -no-pad, -V, -v, -version, -graft-points, -z, <br>
-no-emul-boot, -b, -c, -boot-info-table, -boot-load-size,
-input-charset, -G, -output-charset, -U, -hide,
-hide-joliet, -hide-list, -hide-joliet-list, file paths and
<br>
pathspecs. A lot of options are not supported and lead to
failure of the mkisofs emulation. Some are ignored, but
better do not rely on this tolerance. <br>
The supported options are documented in detail in
xorrisofs.info and in man xorrisofs. The description here is
focused on the effect of mkisofs emulation in the context of
<br>
a xorriso run. <br>
Other than with the &quot;cdrecord&quot; personality there
is no automatic -commit at the end of a &quot;mkisofs&quot;
option list. Verbosity settings -v (= &quot;UPDATE&quot;)
and -quiet (= &quot;SORRY&quot;) <br>
persist. The output file persists until things happen like
-commit, -rollback, -dev, or end of xorriso. <br>
Options which affect all file objects in the ISO image, like
-r or -dir-mode, will be applied only to files which are
present in the ISO image when the command -as ends. <br>
If you use several -as mkisofs commands in the same run,
then consider to put such options into the last -as command.
<br>
If files are added to the image, then -pacifier gets set to
&quot;mkisofs&quot; and -stdio_sync is defaulted to
&quot;off&quot; if no such setting was made yet. <br>
-graft-points is equivalent to -pathspecs on. Note that
pathspecs without &quot;=&quot; are interpreted differently
than with xorriso command -add. Directories get merged with
the <br>
root directory of the ISO image, other filetypes get mapped
into that root directory. <br>
If pathspecs are given and if no output file was chosen
before or during the &quot;mkisofs&quot; option list, then
standard output (-outdev &quot;-&quot;) will get into
effect. If -o points <br>
to a regular file, then it will be truncated to 0 bytes when
finally writing begins. This truncation does not happen if
the drive is chosen by xorriso commands before -as <br>
mkisofs or after its list delimiter. Directories and
symbolic links are no valid -o targets. <br>
Writing to stdout is possible only if -as
&quot;mkisofs&quot; was among the start arguments or if
other start arguments pointed the output drive to standard
output. <br>
-print-size inhibits automatic image production at program
end. This ban is lifted only if the pending image changes
get discarded. <br>
Padding is counted as part of the ISO image if not option
--emul-toc is given. <br>
If no -iso-level is given, then level 1 is chosen when the
first file or directory is added to the image. At the same
occasion directory names get allowed to violate the <br>
standard by -compliance option allow_dir_id_ext. This may be
avoided by option -disallow_dir_id_ext. <br>
Option -root is supported. Option -old-root is implemented
by xorriso commands -mkdir, -cp_clone, -find update_merge,
and -find rm_merge. -root and -old-root set command <br>
-disk_dev_ino to &quot;ino_only&quot; and -md5 to
&quot;on&quot;, by default. -disk_dev_ino can be set to
&quot;off&quot; by --old-root-no-ino or to &quot;on&quot; by
--old-root-devno . -md5 can be set to <br>
&quot;off&quot; by --old-root-no-md5 . <br>
Not original mkisofs options are --quoted_path_list ,
--hardlinks , --acl , --xattr , --md5 , --stdio_sync . They
work like the xorriso commands with the same name and <br>
hardcoded parameter &quot;on&quot;, e.g. -acl
&quot;on&quot;. Explicit parameters are expected by
--stdio_sync and --scdbackup_tag. <br>
The capability to preserve multi-session history on
overwriteable media gets disabled by default. It can be
enabled by using --emul-toc with the first session. See <br>
-compliance no_emul_toc. <br>
--sort-weight gets as parameters a number and an
iso_rr_path. The number becomes the LBA sorting weight of
regular file iso_rr_path or of all regular files underneath
<br>
directory iso_rr_path. (See -find -exec sort_weight). <br>
Adopted from grub-mkisofs are --protective-msdos-label (see
-boot_image grub partition_table=on) and
--modification-date=YYYYMMDDhhmmsscc (see -volume_date
uuid). For EFI <br>
bootable GRUB boot images use --efi-boot. It performs
-boot_image grub efi_path= surrounded by two -boot_image
&quot;any&quot; &quot;next&quot;. Alternative option -e from
Fedora <br>
genisoimage sets bin_path and platform_id for EFI, but
performs no &quot;next&quot;. <br>
For MBR bootable ISOLINUX images there is -isohybrid-mbr
FILE, where FILE is one of the Syslinux files
mbr/isohdp[fp]x*.bin . Use this instead of -G to apply the
effect of <br>
-boot_image isolinux partition_table=on. <br>
--boot-catalog-hide is -boot_image any cat_hidden=on. <br>
-mips-boot is the same as -boot_image any mips_path= . <br>
-mipsel-boot leads to mipsel_path= . <br>
-partition_offset number is -boot_image any
partition_offset=number. <br>
Command -append_partition is supported. <br>
-untranslated_name_len number is -compliance
untranslated_name_len=number. <br>
--old-empty is -compliance old_empty. <br>
The options of genisoimage Jigdo Template Extraction are
recognized and performed via xorriso command -jigdo. See the
&quot;Alias:&quot; names there for the meaning of the <br>
genisoimage options.</p>

If xorriso is started with one of the leafnames
&quot;xorrisofs&quot;, &quot;genisofs&quot;,
&quot;mkisofs&quot;, or &quot;genisoimage&quot;, then it

mkisofs style until &quot;--&quot; is encountered. From then
on, arguments are interpreted as xorriso commands. <br>
--no_rc as first argument of such a program start prevents
interpretation of startup files. See section FILES

padsize=, tsize=, -isosize, -multi, -msinfo,
--grow_overwriteable_iso, write_start_address=, track source

path or &quot;-&quot; for standard input as track source.
<br>
It ignores most other options of cdrecord and cdrskin but
refuses on -audio, -scanbus, and on blanking modes unknown
to xorriso. <br>
The scope is only a single data track per session to be
written to blank, overwriteable, or appendable media. The
medium gets closed if closing is applicable and not <br>
option -multi is present. <br>
If an input drive was acquired, then it is given up. This is
only allowed if no image changes are pending. <br>
dev= must be given as xorriso device address. Addresses like
0,0,0 or ATA:1,1,0 are not supported. <br>
If a track source is given, then an automatic -commit
happens at the end of the &quot;cdrecord&quot; option list.
<br>
--grow_overwriteable_iso enables emulation of multi-session
on overwriteable media. To enable emulation of a TOC, the
first session needs -C 0,32 with -as mkisofs (but no <br>
-M) and --grow_overwriteable_iso write_start_address=32s
with -as cdrecord. <br>
A much more elaborate libburn based cdrecord emulator is the

&quot;jigdo&quot; tells whether production of Jigdo files is
possible. <br>
&quot;zisofs&quot; tells whether zisofs and built-in gzip
filters are enabled. <br>
&quot;external_filter&quot; tells whether external filter
processes are allowed and whether they are allowed if real
user id and effective user id differ. <br>
&quot;dvd_obs&quot; tells whether 64 kB output to DVD media
is default. <br>
&quot;use_readline&quot; tells whether readline may be
enabled in dialog mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-history textline <br>
Copy textline into libreadline history.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-status mode|filter <br>
Print the current settings of xorriso. Modes: <br>
short... print only important or altered settings <br>
long ... print all settings including defaults <br>
long_history like long plus history lines <br>
Filters begin with &rsquo;-&rsquo; and are compared
literally against the output lines of -status:long_history.
A line is put out only if its start matches the filter text.
No <br>
wildcards.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-status_history_max number <br>
Set maximum number of history lines to be reported with
-status &quot;long_history&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-list_delimiter word <br>
Set the list delimiter to be used instead of &quot;--&quot;.
It has to be a single word, must not be empty, not longer
than 80 characters, and must not contain quotation marks.
<br>
For brevity the list delimiter is referred as &quot;--&quot;
throughout this text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sh_style_result
&quot;on&quot;|&quot;off&quot; <br>
Make the result output of some filesystem inspection
commands look more like the output of equivalent shell
commands. The most important effect is to prevent the
wrapping <br>
of file addresses into quotation marks with commands <br>
-pwd -pwdx -ls -lsd -lsl -lsdl -lsx -lsdx -lslx -lsdlx <br>
-du -dus -dux -dusx -findx -find <br>
This will make ambiguous the representation of file names
which contain newline characters. On the other hand it
should facilitate integration of xorriso into shell <br>
scripts which already use the corresponding shell
commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-backslash_codes
&quot;on&quot;|&quot;off&quot;|mode[:mode] <br>
Enable or disable the interpretation of symbolic
representations of special characters with quoted input, or
with program arguments, or with program text output. If <br>
enabled the following translations apply: b a c k s p a <br>
=bell(007) cEscape(033) formfeed(014) e ( 0 1 0 ) \
=carriage_return(015) =tab(011) <br>
0linefeed(012) <br>
vtab(013) \=backslash(134) [0-7][0-7]=octal_code <br>
-f][0-9a-f]=hex_code Translations can occur with quoted
input in 3 modes: <br>
&quot;in_double_quotes&quot; translates only inside &quot;
quotation. <br>
&quot;in_quotes&quot; translates inside &quot; and &rsquo;
quotation. <br>
&quot;with_quoted_input&quot; translates inside and outside
quotes. <br>
With the start program arguments there is mode: <br>
&quot;with_program_arguments&quot; translates program
arguments. <br>
Mode &quot;encode_output&quot; encodes output characters. It
combines &quot;encode_results&quot; with
&quot;encode_infos&quot;. Inside single or double quotation
marks encoding applies to 8-bit <br>
characters octal 001 to 037 , 177 to 377 and to
backslash(134). Outside quotation marks some harmless ASCII
control characters stay unencoded: bell(007),
backspace(010), <br>
tab(011), linefeed(012), formfeed(014),
carriage_return(015). <br>
Mode &quot;off&quot; is default and disables any
translation. Mode &quot;on&quot; is
&quot;with_quoted_input:with_program_arguments:encode_output&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-temp_mem_limit
number[&quot;k&quot;|&quot;m&quot;] <br>
Set the maximum size of temporary memory to be used for
image dependent buffering. Currently this applies to pattern
expansion, LBA sorting, restoring of hard links. <br>
Default is 16m = 16 MiB, minimum 64k = 64 kiB, maximum 1024m
= 1 GiB.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-print text <br>
Print a text line to the result channel which is by default
stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-print_info text <br>
Print a text line to the info channel which is by default
stderr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-print_mark text <br>
Print a text line to the mark channel which is by default
directed to both, result and info channel. An empty text
will cause no output at all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-prompt text <br>
Show text at beginning of output line and wait for the user
to hit the Enter key or to send a line via stdin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sleep seconds <br>
Wait for the given number of seconds before performing the
next command. Expect coarse granularity no better than 1/100
seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-errfile_log mode path|channel
<br>
If problem events are related to input files from the
filesystem, then their disk_paths can be logged to a file or
to output channels R or I. <br>
Mode can either be &quot;plain&quot; or &quot;marked&quot;.
The latter causes marker lines which give the time of log
start, burn session start, burn session end, log end or
program end. In <br>
mode &quot;plain&quot;, only the file paths are logged. <br>
If path is &quot;-&quot; or &quot;-R&quot; then the log is
directed to the result channel. Path &quot;-I&quot; directs
it to the info message channel. Any text that does not begin
with &quot;-&quot; is used as <br>
path for a file to append the log lines. <br>
Problematic files can be recorded multiple times during one
program run. If the program run aborts then the list might
not be complete because some input files might not <br>
have been processed at all. <br>
The errfile paths are transported as messages of very low
severity &quot;ERRFILE&quot;. This transport becomes visible
with -report_about &quot;ALL&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-session_log path <br>
If path is not empty it gives the address of a plain text
file where a log record gets appended after each session.
This log can be used to determine the start_lba of a <br>
session for mount options -o sbsector= (on GNU/Linux) or -s
(on FreeBSD) from date or volume ID. <br>
Record format is: timestamp start_lba size volume-id <br>
The first three items are single words, the rest of the line
is the volume ID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-scsi_log
&quot;on&quot;|&quot;off&quot; <br>
Mode &quot;on&quot; enables very verbous logging of SCSI
commands and drive replies. Logging messages get printed to
stderr, not to any of the xorriso output channels. <br>
A special property of this command is that the first
-scsi_log setting among the start arguments is in effect
already when the first operations of xorriso begin. Only
<br>
&quot;-scsi_log&quot; with dash &quot;-&quot; is recognized
that way.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-end <br>
End program after writing pending changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-rollback_end <br>
Discard pending changes. End program immediately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># any text <br>
Only in dialog or file execution mode, and only as first
non-whitespace in line: Do not execute the line but store it
in readline history.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Support for frontend programs
via stdin and stdout:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pkt_output
&quot;on&quot;|&quot;off&quot; <br>
Consolidate text output on stdout and classify each line by
a channel indicator: <br>
&rsquo;R:&rsquo; for result lines, <br>
&rsquo;I:&rsquo; for notes and error messages, <br>
&rsquo;M:&rsquo; for -mark texts. <br>
Next is a decimal number of which only bit 0 has a meaning
for now. 0 means no newline at end of payload, 1 means that
the newline character at the end of the output line <br>
belongs to the payload. After another colon and a blank
follows the payload text. <br>
Example: <br>
I:1: enter option and parameters :</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-logfile channel fileaddress
<br>
Copy output of a channel to the given file. Channel may be
one of: &quot;.&quot; for all channels, &quot;I&quot; for
info messages, &quot;R&quot; for result lines, &quot;M&quot;
for -mark texts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mark text <br>
If text is not empty it will get put out on &quot;M&quot;
channel each time xorriso is ready for the next dialog line
or before xorriso performs a command that was entered to the
<br>
pager prompt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msg_op opcode parameter_text
<br>
This command shall facilitate extraction of particular
information from the message output of other commands. It
gives access to the C API function Xorriso_parse_line() <br>
and to the message sieve that is provided by the C API.
Please refer to their descriptions in file xorriso.h.
Further it helps to interpret the severity codes of info
<br>
messages. <br>
Intended users are frontend programs which operate xorriso
in dialog mode. <br>
The result output of this command is not caught by the
message sieve. <br>
The following opcodes are defined: <br>
start_sieve <br>
Install the message sieve as of Xorriso_sieve_big() and
start watching program messages. The parameter_text has no
meaning. <br>
show_sieve <br>
Show a list of filter rule names. The parameter_text has no
meaning. The list begins by a line with the return value of
Xorriso_sieve_get_result() with flag bit3. If this <br>
value is larger than 0, then the next line tells the number
of names. The following lines show one name each. <br>
read_sieve <br>
Use the parameter_text as name of a filter rule and inquire
its next recorded result. See Xorriso_sieve_big() for a list
of names and reply strings. <br>
The recorded strings are put out on result channel. They get
wrapped into lines which tell their structure. The first
line tells the return value of <br>
Xorriso_sieve_get_result(). The next line tells the number
of strings. Each string begins by a line that tells the
number of lines of the string. Then follow these lines. <br>
They are to be concatenated with a newline character between
each of them. Finally the number of still available recorded
results of the given name is put out. <br>
clear_sieve <br>
Dispose all recorded strings and continue watching program
messages. The parameter_text has no meaning. <br>
end_sieve <br>
Dispose the sieve with its filter rules and stop watching
program messages. The parameter_text has no meaning. <br>
parse <br>
Read a text from dialog input and submit it to
Xorriso_parse_line(). The parameter_text word shall consist
of several words separated by blanks. It will be necessary
to <br>
use both kinds of quotation marks. <br>
E.g. &quot;&rsquo;ISO session :&rsquo; &rsquo;&rsquo; 0 0
1&quot; <br>
The five parameter words are: prefix, separators, max_words,
flag, number_of_input_lines. The former four are handed over
to Xorriso_parse_line(). The number of input <br>
lines minus one tells xorriso how many newline characters
are part of the input text. <br>
The announced number of text lines will be read from dialog
input, concatenated with a newline character between each of
them, and submitted to Xorriso_parse_line() as <br>
parameter line. Note that newlines outside of quotation
marks are interpreted as separators if the separators
parameter is empty. <br>
The parsed strings are put out on result channel. They get
wrapped into lines which tell their structure. The first
line tells the return value of Xorriso_parse_line(). <br>
The next line tells the number of strings. Each string
begins by a line that tells the number of lines of the
string. Then follow these lines. They are to be concatenated
<br>
with a newline character between each of them. <br>
If -backslash_codes &quot;encode_output&quot; is enabled,
then the strings undergo encoding as if they were enclosed
in quotes. Escpecially each string will be put out as a
single <br>
result line. <br>
parse_bulk <br>
Like &quot;parse&quot;, but with the fifth parameter word
being number_of_input_texts rather than
number_of_input_lines. Each input text has to be preceded by
a line that tells <br>
number_of_input_lines as with &quot;parse&quot;. Then come
the announced number of text lines. <br>
All input texts will be read before printing of result lines
begins. This consumes memory in xorriso. So the
number_of_input_texts should not be extremely high. On the
<br>
other hand, large transactions of command, input texts, and
results are desirable if connection latency is an issue.
<br>
parse_silently <br>
Like &quot;parse&quot; but not issuing a prompting message.
Confusing to humans. <br>
parse_bulk_silently <br>
Like &quot;parse_bulk&quot; but not issuing a prompting
message. Confusing to humans. <br>
compare_sev <br>
The parameter_text should contain two comma separated
severity texts as issued by this program. Like
&quot;SORRY,UPDATE&quot;. See also paragraph &quot;Exception
processing&quot;. <br>
These two severity texts get compared and a number gets
printed to the result channel. This number is 0 if both
severities are equal. It is -1 if the first severity is <br>
lower than the second one. It is 1 is the first severity is
higher than the second one. <br>
Above example &quot;SORRY,UPDATE&quot; will yield 1. <br>
list_sev <br>
Print to the result channel a blank separated list of all
severity names. Sorted from low to high severity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-named_pipe_loop mode[:mode]
disk_path_stdin disk_path_stdout disk_path_stderr <br>
Temporarily replace standard input, standard output and
standard error by named pipes. Enter dialog mode without
readline. <br>
Defined modes are: <br>
&quot;cleanup&quot; removes the submitted pipe files when
the loop ends. <br>
&quot;keep&quot; does not delete them. This is the default.
<br>
&quot;buffered&quot; reads all lines from the input pipe
until EOF before it opens the output pipes and processes the
input lines. <br>
&quot;direct&quot; opens the output pipes after the first
input line was read. Each line is executed directly after it
is read. This is the default. <br>
The other three parameters must either be disk paths to
existing named pipes, or be &quot;-&quot; to leave the
according standard i/o channel unreplaced. <br>
xorriso will open the stdin pipe, read and execute dialog
lines from it until the sender closes the pipe. The output
pipes get opened depending on mode &quot;buffered&quot; or
<br>
&quot;direct&quot;. After all lines are executed, xorriso
will close its side of the pipes and enter a new cycle of
opening, reading and executing. <br>
If an input line consists only of the word
&quot;end_named_pipe_loop&quot; then -named_pipe_loop will
end and further xorriso commands may be executed from other
sources.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-launch_frontend program
[arguments ...] -- <br>
Start the program that is given as first parameter. Submit
the other parameters as program arguments. Enable xorriso
dialog mode. <br>
Two nameless pipe objects are created. xorriso standard
input gets connected to the standard output of the started
program. xorriso standard output and standard error get <br>
connected to the standard input of that program. <br>
xorriso will abort when the started program ends or if it
cannot be started at all. In both cases it will return a
non-zero exit value. The exit value will be zero if the <br>
frontend sends -end or -rollback_end before ending itself.
<br>
This command may be totaly banned at compile time. It is
banned by default if xorriso runs under setuid permissions.
<br>
The program name will not be searched in the $PATH
directories. To make this clear, it must contain at least
one /-character. Best is an absolute path. <br>
Example: <br>
xorriso -launch_frontend &quot;$(which xorriso-tcltk)&quot;
-stdio -- <br>
The frontend program should first send via its standard
output: <br>
-mark 0 -pkt_output on -msg_op start_sieve - -reassure off
<br>
It should be ready to decode -pkt_output and to react on
-mark messages. Best is to increment the -mark number after
each sent command sequence and then to wait for the <br>
new number to show up in a mark message: <br>
...some...commands... -mark &lt;incremented_number&gt; <br>
Further are advised: <br>
-report_about UPDATE -abort_on NEVER <br>
-iso_rr_pattern off -disk_pattern off <br>
A check of the xorriso version should be done, in order to
make sure that all desired features are present. <br>
Command -launch_frontend will only work once per xorriso
run. If no command parameters are submitted or if program is
an empty text, then no program will be started but <br>
nevertheless -launch_frontend will be irrevocably
disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-prog text <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As superuser learn about
available drives <br>
On Linux, FreeBSD or NetBSD consider to give rw-permissions
to those users or groups which shall be able to use the
drives with xorriso. On Solaris use pfexec. Consider to <br>
restrict privileges of xorriso to
&quot;base,sys_devices&quot; and to give r-permission to
user or group. <br>
$ xorriso -device_links <br>
1 -dev &rsquo;/dev/cdrom1&rsquo; rwrw-- :
&rsquo;TSSTcorp&rsquo; &rsquo;DVD-ROM SH-D162C <br>
1 -dev &rsquo;/dev/cdrw&rsquo; rwrw-- :

2 -dev &rsquo;/dev/cdrw3&rsquo; rwrw-- :
&rsquo;HL-DT-ST&rsquo; &rsquo;BDDVDRW_GGC-H20L&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Blank medium and compose a new
ISO image as batch run <br>
Acquire drive /dev/sr2, make medium ready for writing a new
image, fill the image with the files from hard disk
directories /home/me/sounds and /home/me/pictures. <br>
Because no -dialog &quot;on&quot; is given, the program will
then end by writing the session to the medium. <br>
$ xorriso -outdev /dev/sr2 -blank as_needed -map
/home/me/sounds /sounds -map /home/me/pictures /pictures</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ISO image may be shaped in a
more elaborate way like the following: Omit some unwanted
stuff by removing it from the image directory tree.
Reintroduce some wanted stuff. <br>
$ cd /home/me <br>
$ xorriso -outdev /dev/sr2 -blank as_needed -map
/home/me/sounds /sounds -map /home/me/pictures /pictures
-rm_r /sounds/indecent &rsquo;/pictures/*private*&rsquo;
/pictures/confidential -- -cd / -add
pictures/confidential/work* -- <br>
Note that &rsquo;/pictures/*private*&rsquo; is a pattern for
iso_rr_paths while pictures/confidential/work* gets expanded
by the shell with addresses from the hard disk. Commands
-add and <br>
-map have different parameter rules but finally the same
effect: they put files into the image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A dialog session doing about the
same <br>
Some settings are already given as start argument. The other
activities are done as dialog input. The pager gets set to
20 lines of 80 characters. <br>
The drive is acquired by command -dev rather than -outdev in
order to see the message about its current content. By
command -blank this content is made ready for being <br>
overwritten and the loaded ISO image is made empty. <br>
In order to be able to eject the medium, the session needs
to be committed explicitly. <br>
$ xorriso -dialog on -page 20 80 -disk_pattern on <br>
enter option and arguments : <br>
-dev /dev/sr2 <br>
enter option and arguments : <br>
-blank as_needed <br>

-du / <br>
enter option and arguments : <br>
-commit_eject all -end</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Manipulate an existing ISO image
on the same medium <br>
Load image from drive. Remove (i.e. hide) directory /sounds
and its subordinates. Rename directory
/pictures/confidential to /pictures/restricted. Change
access permissions of <br>
directory /pictures/restricted. Add new directory trees
/sounds and /movies. Burn to the same medium, check whether
the tree can be loaded, and eject. <br>
$ xorriso -dev /dev/sr2 -rm_r /sounds -- -mv

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Copy modified ISO image from one
medium to another <br>
Load image from input drive. Do the same manipulations as in
the previous example. Acquire output drive and blank it.
Burn the modified image as first and only session to the
<br>
output drive. <br>
$ xorriso -indev /dev/sr2 -rm_r /sounds -- ... <br>
-outdev /dev/sr0 -blank as_needed -commit -eject all</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bring a prepared ISOLINUX tree
onto medium and make it bootable <br>
The user has already created a suitable file tree on disk
and copied the ISOLINUX files into subdirectory
./boot/isolinux of that tree. Now xorriso can burn an El
Torito <br>
bootable medium: <br>
$ xorriso -outdev /dev/sr0 -blank as_needed -map
/home/me/ISOLINUX_prepared_tree / -boot_image isolinux
dir=/boot/isolinux</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Change existing file name tree
from ISO-8859-1 to UTF-8 <br>
This example assumes that the existing ISO image was written
with character set ISO-8859-1 but that the readers expected
UTF-8. Now a new session gets added with converted file <br>
names. Command -changes_pending &quot;yes&quot; enables
writing despite the lack of any manipulation command. <br>
In order to avoid any weaknesses of the local character set,
this command pretends that it uses already the final target
set UTF-8. Therefore strange file names may appear in <br>
messages, which will be made terminal-safe by command
-backslash_codes. <br>
$ xorriso -in_charset ISO-8859-1 -local_charset UTF-8
-out_charset UTF-8 -backslash_codes on -dev /dev/sr0
-changes_pending yes -commit -eject all</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Operate on storage facilities
other than optical drives <br>
Full read-write operation is possible with regular files and
block devices: <br>
$ xorriso -dev /tmp/regular_file ... <br>
Paths underneath /dev normally need prefix
&quot;stdio:&quot; <br>
$ xorriso -dev stdio:/dev/sdb ... <br>
If /dev/sdb is to be used frequently and /dev/sda is the
system disk, then consider to place the following lines in a
xorriso Startup File. They allow you to use /dev/sdb <br>
without prefix and protect disk /dev/sda from xorriso: <br>
-drive_class banned /dev/sda* <br>
-drive_class harmless /dev/sdb <br>
Other writeable file types are supported write-only: <br>
$ xorriso -outdev /tmp/named_pipe ... <br>
Among the write-only drives is standard output: <br>
$ xorriso -outdev - ... <br>
| gzip &gt;image.iso.gz</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Burn an existing ISO image file
to medium <br>
Actually this works with any kind of data, not only ISO
images: <br>
$ xorriso -as cdrecord -v dev=/dev/sr0 blank=as_needed
image.iso</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perform multi-session runs as of
cdrtools traditions <br>
Between both processes there can be performed arbitrary
transportation or filtering. <br>
The first session is written like this: <br>
$ xorriso -as mkisofs prepared_for_iso/tree1 | xorriso -as
cdrecord -v dev=/dev/sr0 blank=fast -multi -eject - <br>
Follow-up sessions are written like this: <br>
$ dd if=/dev/sr0 count=1 &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 <br>
$ m=$(xorriso -as cdrecord dev=/dev/sr0 -msinfo) <br>
$ xorriso -as mkisofs -M /dev/sr0 -C $m
prepared_for_iso/tree2 | xorriso -as cdrecord -v
dev=/dev/sr0 -waiti -multi -eject - <br>
Always eject the drive tray between sessions. The old
sessions get read via /dev/sr0. Its device driver might not
be aware of the changed content before it loads the medium
<br>
again. In this case the previous session would not be loaded
and the new session would contain only the newly added
files. <br>
For the same reason do not let xorriso -as cdrecord load the
medium, but rather do this manually or by a program that
reads from /dev/sr0. <br>
This example works for multi-session media only. Add cdrskin
option --grow_overwriteable_iso to all -as cdrecord runs in
order to enable multi-session emulation on overwriteable
<br>
media.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Let xorriso work underneath
growisofs <br>
growisofs expects an ISO formatter program which understands
options -C and -M. If xorriso gets started by name
&quot;xorrisofs&quot; then it is suitable for that. <br>
$ export MKISOFS=&quot;xorrisofs&quot; <br>
$ growisofs -Z /dev/dvd /some/files <br>
$ growisofs -M /dev/dvd /more/files <br>
If no &quot;xorrisofs&quot; is available on your system,
then you will have to create a link pointing to the xorriso
binary and tell growisofs to use it. E.g. by: <br>
$ ln -s $(which xorriso) &quot;$HOME/xorrisofs&quot; <br>
$ export MKISOFS=&quot;$HOME/xorrisofs&quot; <br>
One may quit mkisofs emulation by argument &quot;--&quot;
and make use of all xorriso commands. growisofs dislikes
options which start with &quot;-o&quot; but -outdev must be
set to &quot;-&quot;. So use <br>
&quot;outdev&quot; instead: <br>
$ growisofs -Z /dev/dvd -- outdev - -update_r /my/files
/files <br>
$ growisofs -M /dev/dvd -- outdev - -update_r /my/files
/files <br>
growisofs has excellent burn capabilities with DVD and BD.
It does not emulate session history on overwriteable media,
though.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Incremental backup of a few
directory trees <br>
This changes the directory trees /projects and
/personal_mail in the ISO image so that they become exact
copies of their disk counterparts. ISO file objects get
created, deleted <br>
or get their attributes adjusted accordingly. <br>
ACL, xattr, hard links and MD5 checksums will be recorded.
Accelerated comparison is enabled at the expense of
potentially larger backup size. Only media with the expected
<br>
volume ID or blank media are accepted. Files with names
matching *.o or *.swp get excluded explicitly. <br>
When done with writing the new session gets checked by its
recorded MD5. <br>
$ xorriso -abort_on FATAL -for_backup -disk_dev_ino on
-assert_volid &rsquo;PROJECTS_MAIL_*&rsquo; FATAL -dev
/dev/sr0 -volid PROJECTS_MAIL_&quot;$(date
&rsquo;+%Y_%m_%d_%H%M%S&rsquo;)&quot; -not_leaf
&rsquo;*.o&rsquo; -not_leaf &rsquo;*.swp&rsquo; -update_r
/home/thomas/projects /projects -update_r
/home/thomas/personal_mail /personal_mail -commit -toc
-check_md5 FAILURE -- -eject all <br>
To be used several times on the same medium, whenever an
update of the two disk trees to the medium is desired. Begin
with a blank medium and update it until the run fails <br>
gracefully due to lack of remaining space on the old one.
<br>
This makes sense if the full backup leaves substantial
remaining capacity on media and if the expected changes are
much smaller than the full backup. To apply zisofs
compression <br>
to those data files which get newly copied from the local
filesystem, insert these commands immediately before -commit
: <br>
-hardlinks perform_update -find / -type f -pending_data
-exec set_filter --zisofs -- Commands -disk_dev_ino and
-for_backup depend on stable device and inode numbers on
disk. Without them, an update run may use -md5
&quot;on&quot; to match recorded MD5 sums against the <br>
current file content on hard disk. This is usually much
faster than the default which compares both contents
directly. <br>
With mount option -o &quot;sbsector=&quot; on GNU/Linux or
-s on FreeBSD or NetBSD it is possible to access the session
trees which represent the older backup versions. With CD
media, <br>
GNU/Linux mount accepts session numbers directly by its
option &quot;session=&quot;. <br>
Multi-session media and most overwriteable media written by
xorriso can tell the sbsectors of their sessions by xorriso
command -toc. Used after -commit the following command <br>
prints the matching mount command for the newly written
session (here for mount point /mnt): <br>
-mount_cmd &quot;indev&quot; &quot;auto&quot;
&quot;auto&quot; /mnt <br>
Commands -mount_cmd and -mount are also able to produce the
mount commands for older sessions in the table-of-content.
E.g. as superuser: <br>
# osirrox -mount /dev/sr0 &quot;volid&quot;
&rsquo;*2008_12_05*&rsquo; /mnt</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Above example produces a result
similar to -root / -old-root / with mkisofs. For getting the
session trees accumulated in the new sessions, let all
-update commands use a <br>
common parent directory and clone it after updating is done:
<br>
-update_r /home/thomas/projects /current/projects -update_r
/home/thomas/personal_mail /current/personal_mail -clone
/current /&quot;$(date &rsquo;+%Y_%m_%d_%H%M%S&rsquo;)&quot;
The cloned tree will have a name like
/2011_02_12_155700.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sessions on multi-session media
are separated by several MB of unused blocks. So with small
sessions the payload capacity can become substantially lower
than the overall media <br>
capacity. If the remaining space on a medium does not
suffice for the next gap, the drive is supposed to close the
medium automatically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Better do not use your youngest
backup for -update_r. Have at least two media which you use
alternatingly. So only older backups get endangered by the
new write operation, while <br>
the newest backup is stored safely on a different medium.
<br>
Always have a blank medium ready to perform a full backup in
case the update attempt fails due to insufficient remaining
capacity. This failure will not spoil the old medium, of
<br>
course.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Restore directory trees from a
particular ISO session to disk <br>
This is an alternative to mounting the medium and using
normal file operations. <br>
First check which backup sessions are on the medium: <br>
$ xorriso -outdev /dev/sr0 -toc <br>
Then enable restoring of ACL, xattr and hard links. Load the
desired session and copy the file trees to disk. Avoid to
create /home/thomas/restored without rwx-permission. <br>
$ xorriso -for_backup -load volid
&rsquo;PROJECTS_MAIL_2008_06_19*&rsquo; -indev /dev/sr0
-osirrox on:auto_chmod_on -chmod u+rwx / -- -extract
/projects /home/thomas/restored/projects -extract
/personal_mail /home/thomas/restored/personal_mail
-rollback_end <br>
The final command -rollback_end prevents an error message
about the altered image being discarded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Try to retrieve blocks from a
damaged medium <br>
$ xorriso -abort_on NEVER -indev /dev/sr0 -check_media
time_limit=1800 report=blocks_files
data_to=&quot;$HOME&quot;/dvd_copy
sector_map=&quot;$HOME&quot;/dvd_copy.map -- <br>
This can be repeated several times, if necessary with -eject
or with other -indev drives. See the human readable part of
&quot;$HOME&quot;/dvd_copy.map for addresses which can be
used on <br>
&quot;$HOME&quot;/dvd_copy with mount option -o sbsector= or
-s.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
Program alias names: <br>
Normal installation of xorriso creates three links or copies
which by their program name pre-select certain settings:
<br>
xorrisofs starts xorriso with -as mkisofs emulation. <br>
xorrecord starts xorriso with -as cdrecord emulation. <br>
osirrox starts with -osirrox &quot;on:o_excl_off&quot; which
allows further commands to copy files from ISO image to disk
and to apply command -mount to one or more of the existing
ISO <br>
sessions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Startup files: <br>
If not -no_rc is given as the first argument then xorriso
attempts on startup to read and execute lines from the
following files: <br>
/etc/default/xorriso <br>
/etc/opt/xorriso/rc <br>
/etc/xorriso/xorriso.conf <br>
$HOME/.xorrisorc <br>
The files are read in the sequence given above, but none of
them is required to exist. The line format is described with
command -options_from_file. <br>
If mkisofs emulation was enabled by program name
&quot;xorrisofs&quot;, &quot;mkisofs&quot;,
&quot;genisoimage&quot;, or &quot;genisofs&quot;, then
afterwards -read_mkisofsrc is performed, which reads
.mkisofsrc files. <br>
See there.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Runtime control files: <br>
The default setting of -check_media abort_file= is: <br>
/var/opt/xorriso/do_abort_check_media</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
The following environment variables influence the program
behavior: <br>
HOME is used to find xorriso and mkisofs startup files. <br>
SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH belongs to the specs of
reproducible-builds.org. It is supposed to be either
undefined or to contain a decimal number which tells the
seconds since january 1st <br>
1970. If it contains a number, then it is used as time value
to set the default of -volume date &quot;uuid&quot;, sets
-boot_image &quot;any&quot; &quot;gpt_disk_guid=&quot; to
&quot;volume_date_uuid&quot;, and <br>
-volume_date &quot;all_file_dates&quot; to
&quot;set_to_mtime&quot;, <br>
Startup files and program options can override the effect of
SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH.</p>
