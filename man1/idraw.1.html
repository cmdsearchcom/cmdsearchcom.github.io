Idraw is a drawing editor that lets you create and edit drawings made up of
  graphics like text, lines, splines, rectangles, polygons, and ellipses.
  Drawings are stored in files that can be printed on a PostScript printer. You
  can can open an existing drawing when starting up idraw by typing a file name
  on the command line.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Idraw displays a portrait or landscape view of an 8.5 by 11 inch page in its
  <i>drawing area</i>. In a column along the drawing area's left side is a set
  of <i>drawing tool</i> icons, and above the drawing area is a set of pull-down
  menus containing <i>commands</i>. A panner in the lower left corner lets you
  pan and zoom the the drawing area. Along the top is a set of indicators that
  display editing information.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DRAWING_TOOLS"><a class="selflink" href="#DRAWING_TOOLS">DRAWING
  TOOLS</a></h1>
You must engage a tool before you can use it. You engage a tool by clicking on
  its icon or by typing the character below and to the right of its icon. The
  icon of the drawing tool that's engaged appears in inverted colors. Once
  engaged, you use the tool by clicking the left mouse button in the drawing
  area.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The <b>Select</b>, <b>Move</b>, <b>Scale</b>, <b>Stretch</b>, <b>Rotate</b>, and
  <b>Alter</b> tools manipulate existing graphics. <b>Magnify</b> makes a part
  of the view expand to fill the entire view. <b>Text</b>, <b>Line</b>,
  <b>Multiline</b>, <b>Open Spline</b>, <b>Ellipse</b>, <b>Rectangle</b>,
  <b>Polygon</b>, and <b>Closed Spline</b> create new graphics. Each tool works
  as follows:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Select</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Select a graphic, unselecting all others. A graphic is
      selected if its <i>handles</i> are visible. Handles are small
      inverse-video squares that either surround the graphic or demarcate its
      important points (such as the endpoints of a line). If you hold down the
      shift key, <b>Select</b> <i>extends</i> the selection: it selects the
      unselected graphic (or unselects the selected graphic) you clicked on but
      does not unselect other selections. Clicking anywhere other than on a
      graphic unselects everything; you may also drag a rubberband rectangle
      around a group of graphics to select all of them at once. <i>Shortcut:</i>
      the right mouse button invokes <b>Select</b> while the mouse is in the
      drawing area.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Move</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Move graphics from one spot to another. <i>Shortcut:</i>
      the middle mouse button invokes <b>Move</b> while the mouse is in the
      drawing area.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Scale</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Scale graphics about their centers.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Stretch</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Stretch graphics vertically or horizontally while tying
      down the opposite edge.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Rotate</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Rotate graphics about their centers according to the angle
      between two radii: the one defined by the original clicking point and the
      one defined by the current dragging point.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Alter</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Modify a graphic's structure. This tool's effect is
      described below for each graphic.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Magnify</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Magnify a portion of the drawing specified by sweeping out
      a rectangular area. Idraw will magnify the area to occupy the entire
      screen, if possible.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Text</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Create some text. Left-click to position the first line of
      text, and then type as much text as you want. You may use emacs-style
      keystrokes to edit the text as well as enter it. You can leave text
      editing mode by typing ESC or by simply clicking somewhere else. The Alter
      tool lets you edit the text in an existing text graphic.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Line</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Create a line. The shift key constrains the line to lie on
      either the vertical or the horizontal axis. You may left-click with the
      Alter tool on either endpoint of a line to move the endpoint to a new
      location.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Multiline</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Create a set of connected lines. The shift key constrains
      each segment to lie on either the vertical or the horizontal axis. Each
      left-click starts a new segment (i.e., adds a vertex); each right-click
      removes the last vertex added. The middle button finalizes the multiline.
      The Alter tool lets you move, add, and remove vertices from an existing
      multiline.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Open Spline</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Create an open B-spline. The shift key constrains each
      control point to lie on either the vertical or the horizontal axis with
      the preceding point. Each left-click adds a control point; each
      right-click removes the last control point added. The middle button
      finalizes the spline. The Alter tool lets you move, add, and remove
      control points from an existing open spline.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Ellipse</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Create an ellipse. The shift key constrains the ellipse to
      the shape of a circle. The Alter tool does not affect ellipses.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Rectangle</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Create a rectangle. The shift key constrains the rectangle
      to the shape of a square. The Alter tool lets you move the rectangle's
      corners independently to form a four-sided polygon.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Polygon</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Create a polygon. The shift key constrains each side to lie
      on either the vertical or the horizontal axis. Each left-click starts a
      new segment (i.e., adds a vertex); each right-click removes the last
      vertex added. The middle button finalizes the polygon. The Alter tool lets
      you move, add, and remove vertices from an existing polygon.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Closed Spline</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Create a closed B-spline. The shift key constrains each
      control point to lie on either the vertical or the horizontal axis with
      the preceding point. Each left-click adds a control point; each

</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>Structure</b> menu contains the following commands to modify the
  structure of the drawing, that is, the order in which graphics are drawn:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Group</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Nest the selected graphics in a newly created picture. A
      picture is just a graphic that contains other graphics. <b>Group</b>
      allows you to build hierarchies of graphics.</dd>

  <dd class="It-tag">Send the selected graphics to the back of the drawing so
      that they are drawn behind (before) other graphics.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>Font</b> menu contains a set of fonts in which to display text. When you
  set the current font from the menu, you will also set all the selected
  graphics' fonts to that font. A font indicator in the upper right corner
  displays the current font.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>Brush</b> menu contains a set of brushes with which to draw lines. When
  you set the current brush from the menu, you will also set all the selected
  graphics' brushes to that brush. The nonexistent brush draws invisible lines
  and non-outlined graphics. The arrowhead brushes add arrowheads to either or
  both ends of lines, multilines, and open splines. A brush indicator in the
  upper left corner displays the current brush.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>Pattern</b> menu contains a set of patterns with which to fill graphics
  but not text. Text always appears solid, but you can use a different color
  than black to get a halftoned shade. When you set the current pattern from the
  menu, you will also set all the selected graphics' patterns to that pattern.
  The nonexistent pattern draws unfilled graphics, while the other patterns draw
  graphics filled with a bitmap or a halftoned shade.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>FgColor</b> and <b>BgColor</b> menus contains a set of colors with which
  to draw graphics and text. When you set the current foreground or background
  color from the FgColor or BgColor menu, you will also set all the selected
  graphics' foreground or background colors. The ``on'' bits in the bitmaps for
  dashed lines and fill patterns appear in the foreground color while the
  ``off'' bits appear in the background color. A black and white printer will
  print a halftoned shade of gray for any color other than black or white. The
  brush, pattern, and font indicators all reflect the current colors.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>Align</b> menu contains commands to align graphics with other graphics.
  The first graphic selected stays fixed while the other graphics move in the
  order they were selected according to the type of alignment chosen. The last
  Align command, <b>Align to Grid</b><b>, aligns a key</b> <b>point on each
  selected graphic to the nearest point on idraw's grid</b> <b>(see below).</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>View</b> menu contains the following commands:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>New View</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Create a duplicate idraw window containing a second view of
      the current drawing. The second view may be panned, zoomed, and edited
      independently of the first. Any number of additional views may be made in
      this manner. Changes made to a drawing through one view appear
      synchronously in all other views of the same drawing. You may also view
      another drawing in any idraw window via the Open command.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Close View</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Close the current idraw window. Closing the last idraw

  <dd class="It-tag">Set the magnification to unity so the drawing appears at
      actual size.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Reduce to Fit</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Reduce the magnification until the drawing fits entirely
      within the view.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Center Page</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Center the view over the center of the 8.5 by 11 inch
    page.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Orientation</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Toggle the drawing's orientation. If the editor was
      formerly showing a portrait view of the drawing, it will now show a
      landscape view of the drawing and vice versa.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Grid on/off</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Toggle idraw's grid on or off. When the grid is on, idraw
      draws a grid of equally spaced points behind the drawing.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Grid Spacing...</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Change the grid spacing by specifying one or two values in
      the units desired (pixels, points, centimeters, or inches). If two values
      are given (separated by a space), the first specifies the horizontal
      spacing and second the vertical spacing. One value will specify equal
      horizontal and vertical spacing.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Gravity on/off</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Toggle gravity on or off. Gravity constrains tool operation
      to the grid, whether or not the grid is visible.</dd>
</dl>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="X_DEFAULTS"><a class="selflink" href="#X_DEFAULTS">X
  DEFAULTS</a></h1>
You can customize the number of undoable changes and the font, brush, pattern,
  or color menus by setting resources in your X defaults database. Each string
  of the form ``idraw.resource:definition'' sets a resource. For example, to
  customize any of the paint menus, set a resource given by the concatenation of
  the menu's name and the entry's number (e.g., ``idraw.pattern8'') for each
  entry that you want to override. All menus use the number 1 for the first
  entry.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
You must set resources only for the entries that you want to override, not all
  of them. If you want to add entries to the menus, simply set resources for
  them. However, don't skip any numbers after the end of the menu, because the
  menu will end at the first undefined resource. To shorten a menu instead of
  extending it, specify a blank string as the resource for the entry following
  the last.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Idraw understands the following resources:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>history</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Set the maximum number of undoable changes (20 by
    default).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>initialfont</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Specify the font that will be active on startup. Supply a
      number that identifies the font by its position in the Font menu starting
      from 1 for the first entry.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>font</b><i>i</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Define a custom font to use for the <i>i</i>th entry in the
      Font menu. Give three strings separated by whitespace. The first string
      defines the font's name, the second string the corresponding print font,
      and the third string the print size. For example, ``idraw.font3:8x13bold
      Courier-Bold 13'' defines the third font entry.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>initialbrush</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Specify the brush that will be active on startup. Give a
      number that identifies the brush by its position in the Brush menu
      starting from 1 for the first entry.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>brush</b><i>i</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Define a custom brush to use for the <i>i</i>th entry in
      the Brush menu. The definition requires two numbers: a 16-bit hexadecimal
      number to define the brush's line style (each 1 bit draws a dash and each
      0 bit produces a gap), and a decimal integer to define the brush's width
      in pixels. For example, ``idraw.brush2:ffff 1'' defines a single pixel
      wide solid line. If the definition specifies only the string ``none'',
      then it defines the nonexistent brush.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>initialpattern</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Specify the pattern that will be active on startup. Give a
      number that identifies the pattern by its position in the Pattern menu
      starting from 1 for the first entry.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>pattern</b><i>i</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Define a custom pattern to use for the <i>i</i>th entry in
      the Pattern menu. You can specify the pattern from a 16x16 bitmap, a 8x8
      bitmap, a 4x4 bitmap, a grayscale number, or the string ``none''. You
      specify the 16x16 bitmap with sixteen 16-bit hexadecimal numbers, the 8x8
      bitmap with eight 8-bit hexadecimal numbers, the 4x4 bitmap with a single
      16-bit hexadecimal number, and the grayscale number with a single floating
      point number. The floating point number must contain a period to
      distinguish itself from the single hexadecimal number, and it must lie
      between 0.0 and 1.0, where 0.0 corresponds to a solid pattern and 1.0 to a
      clear pattern. On the printer, the bitmap patterns appear as bitmaps, the
      grayscale patterns appear as halftoned shades, and the ``none'' patterns
      never obscure any underlying graphics. For example,
      ``idraw.pattern8:8421'' defines a diagonally hatched pattern.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>initialfgcolor</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Specify the foreground color that will be active on
      startup. Give a number that identifies the color by its position in the
      FgColor menu starting from 1 for the first entry.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>fgcolor</b><i>i</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Define a custom color to use for the <i>i</i>th entry in
      the FgColor menu. Give a string defining the name of the color and
      optionally three decimal numbers between 0 and 65535 following the name to
      define the red, green, and blue components of the color's intensity. The
      intensities override the name; that is, idraw will look the name up in a
      window system database of common colors only if you omit the intensities.
      You can define shades of gray by using equal proportions of each primary
      color. For example, ``idraw.fgcolor8:Indigo 48896 0 65280'' defines a
      color that is a mixture of red and blue.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>initialbgcolor</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Specify the background color that will be active on
      startup. Give a number that identifies the color by its position in the
      BgColor menu starting from 1 for the first entry.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>bgcolor</b><i>i</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Define a custom color to use for the <i>i</i>th entry in
      the BgColor menu. The same rules apply to background colors as to
