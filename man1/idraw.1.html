<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
idraw - drawing editor</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
idraw [options] [file]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Idraw is a drawing editor that lets you create and edit
drawings made up of graphics like text, lines, splines,
rectangles, polygons, and ellipses. Drawings are stored in
files <br>
that can be printed on a PostScript printer. You can can
open an existing drawing when starting up idraw by typing a
file name on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Idraw displays a portrait or
landscape view of an 8.5 by 11 inch page in its drawing
area. In a column along the drawing area&rsquo;s left side
is a set of drawing tool icons, and <br>
above the drawing area is a set of pull-down menus
containing commands. A panner in the lower left corner lets
you pan and zoom the the drawing area. Along the top is a
set of <br>
indicators that display editing information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DRAWING TOOLS <br>
You must engage a tool before you can use it. You engage a
tool by clicking on its icon or by typing the character
below and to the right of its icon. The icon of the drawing
<br>
tool that&rsquo;s engaged appears in inverted colors. Once
engaged, you use the tool by clicking the left mouse button
in the drawing area.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Select, Move, Scale,
Stretch, Rotate, and Alter tools manipulate existing
graphics. Magnify makes a part of the view expand to fill
the entire view. Text, Line, Multiline, <br>
Open Spline, Ellipse, Rectangle, Polygon, and Closed Spline
create new graphics. Each tool works as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Select Select a graphic,
unselecting all others. A graphic is selected if its handles
are visible. Handles are small inverse-video squares that
either surround the <br>
graphic or demarcate its important points (such as the
endpoints of a line). If you hold down the shift key, Select
extends the selection: it selects the unse&acirc; <br>
lected graphic (or unselects the selected graphic) you
clicked on but does not unselect other selections. Clicking
anywhere other than on a graphic unselects <br>
everything; you may also drag a rubberband rectangle around
a group of graphics to select all of them at once. Shortcut:
the right mouse button invokes Select <br>
while the mouse is in the drawing area.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Move Move graphics from one spot
to another. Shortcut: the middle mouse button invokes Move
while the mouse is in the drawing area.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Scale Scale graphics about their
centers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Stretch Stretch graphics
vertically or horizontally while tying down the opposite
edge.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Rotate Rotate graphics about
their centers according to the angle between two radii: the
one defined by the original clicking point and the one
defined by the current <br>
dragging point.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alter Modify a graphic&rsquo;s
structure. This tool&rsquo;s effect is described below for
each graphic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Magnify Magnify a portion of the
drawing specified by sweeping out a rectangular area. Idraw
will magnify the area to occupy the entire screen, if
possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Text Create some text.
Left-click to position the first line of text, and then type
as much text as you want. You may use emacs-style keystrokes
to edit the text as <br>
well as enter it. You can leave text editing mode by typing
ESC or by simply clicking somewhere else. The Alter tool
lets you edit the text in an existing text <br>
graphic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Line Create a line. The shift
key constrains the line to lie on either the vertical or the
horizontal axis. You may left-click with the Alter tool on
either endpoint <br>
of a line to move the endpoint to a new location.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Multiline Create a set of
connected lines. The shift key constrains each segment to
lie on either the vertical or the horizontal axis. Each
left-click starts a new segment <br>
(i.e., adds a vertex); each right-click removes the last
vertex added. The middle button finalizes the multiline. The
Alter tool lets you move, add, and remove <br>
vertices from an existing multiline.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Open Spline Create an open
B-spline. The shift key constrains each control point to lie
on either the vertical or the horizontal axis with the
preceding point. Each left- <br>
click adds a control point; each right-click removes the
last control point added. The middle button finalizes the
spline. The Alter tool lets you move, add, and <br>
remove control points from an existing open spline.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ellipse Create an ellipse. The
shift key constrains the ellipse to the shape of a circle.
The Alter tool does not affect ellipses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Rectangle Create a rectangle.
The shift key constrains the rectangle to the shape of a
square. The Alter tool lets you move the rectangle&rsquo;s
corners independently to form a <br>
four-sided polygon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Polygon Create a polygon. The
shift key constrains each side to lie on either the vertical
or the horizontal axis. Each left-click starts a new segment
(i.e., adds a <br>
vertex); each right-click removes the last vertex added. The
middle button finalizes the polygon. The Alter tool lets you
move, add, and remove vertices from an <br>
existing polygon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Closed Spline Create a closed
B-spline. The shift key constrains each control point to lie
on either the vertical or the horizontal axis with the
preceding point. Each left- <br>
click adds a control point; each right-click removes the
last control point added. The middle button finalizes the
spline. The Alter tool lets you move, add, and <br>
remove control points from an existing closed spline.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PULL-DOWN MENUS <br>
The pull-down menus File, Edit, Structure, Font, Brush,
Pattern, FgColor, BgColor, Align, and View above the drawing
area contain commands for editing the drawing and for
con&acirc; <br>
trolling idraw&rsquo;s execution. The File menu contains the
following commands to operate on files:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">New Destroy the current drawing
and replace it with an unnamed blank drawing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Revert Reread the current
drawing, destroying any unsaved changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Open... Specify an existing
drawing to edit through a FileChooser(3I), which lets you
browse the file system easily.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Save As... Save the current
drawing in a file with a specific name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Save Save the current drawing in
the file it came from.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Print... Send a PostScript
version of the drawing to a printer or to a file. The bold
rectangular outline (called the page boundary) appearing in
the drawing area indi&acirc; <br>
cates the portion of the drawing that will appear on the
printed page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Import Graphic... <br>
Create a graphic from the information in a file and insert
it into the current drawing. Idraw can import images from
files in the following formats: TIFF; Post&acirc; <br>
Script generated by pgmtops, ppmtops, and idraw; X bitmap
format; and Unidraw format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Quit Quit idraw.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Edit menu contains the
following commands for editing graphics:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Undo Undo the last editing
operation. Successive Undo commands undo earlier and earlier
editing operations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Redo Redo the last editing
operation. Successive Redo commands redo later and later
editing operations up to the first operation undone by Undo.
Undone operations <br>
that have not been redone are lost as soon as a new
operation is performed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cut Remove the selected graphics
from the drawing and place them in a temporary storage area
called the clipboard.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Copy Copy the selected graphics
into the clipboard.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Paste Paste copies of the
graphics in the clipboard into the drawing. Together, Cut,
Copy, and Paste let you transfer graphics between drawings
simply by cutting graph&acirc; <br>
ics out of one view and pasting them into another.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Duplicate Duplicate the selected
graphics and add the copies to the drawing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Delete Destroy the selected
graphics.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Select All Select every graphic
in the drawing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Flip Horizontal, Flip Vertical
<br>
Flip the selected graphics into their mirror images along
the horizontal or vertical axes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">90 Clockwise, 90 CounterCW <br>
Rotate the selected graphics 90 degrees clockwise or
counterclockwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Precise Move..., Precise
Scale..., Precise Rotate... <br>
Move, scale, or rotate graphics by exact amounts that you
type in a dialog box. You can specify movements in pixels,
points, centimeters, or inches. Scalings are <br>
specified in terms of magnification factors in the
horizontal and vertical dimensions. Rotations are in
degrees.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Structure menu contains the
following commands to modify the structure of the drawing,
that is, the order in which graphics are drawn:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Group Nest the selected graphics
in a newly created picture. A picture is just a graphic that
contains other graphics. Group allows you to build
hierarchies of graph&acirc; <br>
ics.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ungroup Dissolve any selected
pictures.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bring To Front Bring the
selected graphics to the front of the drawing so that they
are drawn on top of (after) other graphics.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Send To Back Send the selected
graphics to the back of the drawing so that they are drawn
behind (before) other graphics.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Font menu contains a set of
fonts in which to display text. When you set the current
font from the menu, you will also set all the selected
graphics&rsquo; fonts to that font. A <br>
font indicator in the upper right corner displays the
current font.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Brush menu contains a set of
brushes with which to draw lines. When you set the current
brush from the menu, you will also set all the selected
graphics&rsquo; brushes to that <br>
brush. The nonexistent brush draws invisible lines and
non-outlined graphics. The arrowhead brushes add arrowheads
to either or both ends of lines, multilines, and open <br>
splines. A brush indicator in the upper left corner displays
the current brush.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Pattern menu contains a set
of patterns with which to fill graphics but not text. Text
always appears solid, but you can use a different color than
black to get a halftoned <br>
shade. When you set the current pattern from the menu, you
will also set all the selected graphics&rsquo; patterns to
that pattern. The nonexistent pattern draws unfilled
graphics, <br>
while the other patterns draw graphics filled with a bitmap
or a halftoned shade.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The FgColor and BgColor menus
contains a set of colors with which to draw graphics and
text. When you set the current foreground or background
color from the FgColor or BgColor <br>
menu, you will also set all the selected graphics&rsquo;
foreground or background colors. The
&lsquo;&lsquo;on&rsquo;&rsquo; bits in the bitmaps for
dashed lines and fill patterns appear in the foreground <br>
color while the &lsquo;&lsquo;off&rsquo;&rsquo; bits appear
in the background color. A black and white printer will
print a halftoned shade of gray for any color other than
black or white. The brush, <br>
pattern, and font indicators all reflect the current
colors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Align menu contains commands
to align graphics with other graphics. The first graphic
selected stays fixed while the other graphics move in the
order they were selected <br>
according to the type of alignment chosen. The last Align
command, Align to Grid, aligns a key point on each selected
graphic to the nearest point on idraw&rsquo;s grid (see
below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The View menu contains the
following commands:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">New View Create a duplicate
idraw window containing a second view of the current
drawing. The second view may be panned, zoomed, and edited
independently of the first. <br>
Any number of additional views may be made in this manner.
Changes made to a drawing through one view appear
synchronously in all other views of the same drawing. <br>
You may also view another drawing in any idraw window via
the Open command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Close View Close the current
idraw window. Closing the last idraw window is equivalent to
issuing a Quit command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normal Size Set the
magnification to unity so the drawing appears at actual
size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Reduce to Fit Reduce the
magnification until the drawing fits entirely within the
view.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Center Page Center the view over
the center of the 8.5 by 11 inch page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Orientation Toggle the
drawing&rsquo;s orientation. If the editor was formerly
showing a portrait view of the drawing, it will now show a
landscape view of the drawing and vice <br>
versa.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Grid on/off Toggle idraw&rsquo;s
grid on or off. When the grid is on, idraw draws a grid of
equally spaced points behind the drawing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Grid Spacing... <br>
Change the grid spacing by specifying one or two values in
the units desired (pixels, points, centimeters, or inches).
If two values are given (separated by a <br>
space), the first specifies the horizontal spacing and
second the vertical spacing. One value will specify equal
horizontal and vertical spacing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Gravity on/off Toggle gravity on
or off. Gravity constrains tool operation to the grid,
whether or not the grid is visible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">X DEFAULTS <br>
You can customize the number of undoable changes and the
font, brush, pattern, or color menus by setting resources in
your X defaults database. Each string of the form <br>
&lsquo;&lsquo;idraw.resource:definition&rsquo;&rsquo; sets a
resource. For example, to customize any of the paint menus,
set a resource given by the concatenation of the
menu&rsquo;s name and the entry&rsquo;s <br>
number (e.g., &lsquo;&lsquo;idraw.pattern8&rsquo;&rsquo;)
for each entry that you want to override. All menus use the
number 1 for the first entry.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You must set resources only for
the entries that you want to override, not all of them. If
you want to add entries to the menus, simply set resources
for them. However, don&rsquo;t <br>
skip any numbers after the end of the menu, because the menu
will end at the first undefined resource. To shorten a menu
instead of extending it, specify a blank string as the <br>
resource for the entry following the last.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Idraw understands the following
resources:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">history Set the maximum number
of undoable changes (20 by default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">initialfont Specify the font
that will be active on startup. Supply a number that
identifies the font by its position in the Font menu
starting from 1 for the first entry.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fonti Define a custom font to
use for the ith entry in the Font menu. Give three strings
separated by whitespace. The first string defines the
font&rsquo;s name, the second <br>
string the corresponding print font, and the third string
the print size. For example,
&lsquo;&lsquo;idraw.font3:8x13bold Courier-Bold
13&rsquo;&rsquo; defines the third font entry.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">initialbrush Specify the brush
that will be active on startup. Give a number that
identifies the brush by its position in the Brush menu
starting from 1 for the first entry.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">brushi Define a custom brush to
use for the ith entry in the Brush menu. The definition
requires two numbers: a 16-bit hexadecimal number to define
the brush&rsquo;s line <br>
style (each 1 bit draws a dash and each 0 bit produces a
gap), and a decimal integer to define the brush&rsquo;s
width in pixels. For example,
&lsquo;&lsquo;idraw.brush2:ffff 1&rsquo;&rsquo; <br>
defines a single pixel wide solid line. If the definition
specifies only the string &lsquo;&lsquo;none&rsquo;&rsquo;,
then it defines the nonexistent brush.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">initialpattern Specify the
pattern that will be active on startup. Give a number that
identifies the pattern by its position in the Pattern menu
starting from 1 for the first <br>
entry.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">patterni Define a custom pattern
to use for the ith entry in the Pattern menu. You can
specify the pattern from a 16x16 bitmap, a 8x8 bitmap, a 4x4
bitmap, a grayscale <br>
number, or the string &lsquo;&lsquo;none&rsquo;&rsquo;. You
specify the 16x16 bitmap with sixteen 16-bit hexadecimal
numbers, the 8x8 bitmap with eight 8-bit hexadecimal
numbers, the 4x4 <br>
bitmap with a single 16-bit hexadecimal number, and the
grayscale number with a single floating point number. The
floating point number must contain a period to <br>
distinguish itself from the single hexadecimal number, and
it must lie between 0.0 and 1.0, where 0.0 corresponds to a
solid pattern and 1.0 to a clear pattern. <br>
On the printer, the bitmap patterns appear as bitmaps, the
grayscale patterns appear as halftoned shades, and the
&lsquo;&lsquo;none&rsquo;&rsquo; patterns never obscure any
underlying <br>
graphics. For example,
&lsquo;&lsquo;idraw.pattern8:8421&rsquo;&rsquo; defines a
diagonally hatched pattern.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">initialfgcolor Specify the
foreground color that will be active on startup. Give a
number that identifies the color by its position in the
FgColor menu starting from 1 for the <br>
first entry.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fgcolori Define a custom color
to use for the ith entry in the FgColor menu. Give a string
defining the name of the color and optionally three decimal
numbers between 0 <br>
and 65535 following the name to define the red, green, and
blue components of the color&rsquo;s intensity. The
intensities override the name; that is, idraw will look <br>
the name up in a window system database of common colors
only if you omit the intensities. You can define shades of
gray by using equal proportions of each pri&acirc; <br>
mary color. For example, &lsquo;&lsquo;idraw.fgcolor8:Indigo
48896 0 65280&rsquo;&rsquo; defines a color that is a
mixture of red and blue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">initialbgcolor Specify the
background color that will be active on startup. Give a
number that identifies the color by its position in the
BgColor menu starting from 1 for the <br>
first entry.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bgcolori Define a custom color
to use for the ith entry in the BgColor menu. The same rules
apply to background colors as to foreground colors.</p>
