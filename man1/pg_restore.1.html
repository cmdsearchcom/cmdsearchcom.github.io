<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pg_restore - restore a PostgreSQL database from an archive
file created by pg_dump</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pg_restore [connection-option...] [option...] [filename]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
pg_restore is a utility for restoring a PostgreSQL database
from an archive created by pg_dump(1) in one of the
non-plain-text formats. It will issue the commands necessary
to <br>
reconstruct the database to the state it was in at the time
it was saved. The archive files also allow pg_restore to be
selective about what is restored, or even to reorder the
<br>
items prior to being restored. The archive files are
designed to be portable across architectures.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pg_restore can operate in two
modes. If a database name is specified, pg_restore connects
to that database and restores archive contents directly into
the database. Otherwise, a <br>
script containing the SQL commands necessary to rebuild the
database is created and written to a file or standard
output. This script output is equivalent to the plain text
<br>
output format of pg_dump. Some of the options controlling
the output are therefore analogous to pg_dump options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Obviously, pg_restore cannot
restore information that is not present in the archive file.
For instance, if the archive was made using the &acirc;dump
data as INSERT commands&acirc; option, <br>
pg_restore will not be able to load the data using COPY
statements.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
pg_restore accepts the following command line arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">filename <br>
Specifies the location of the archive file (or directory,
for a directory-format archive) to be restored. If not
specified, the standard input is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a, --data-only <br>
Restore only the data, not the schema (data definitions).
Table data, large objects, and sequence values are restored,
if present in the archive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is similar to, but
for historical reasons not identical to, specifying
--section=data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --clean <br>
Clean (drop) database objects before recreating them. (This
might generate some harmless error messages, if any objects
were not present in the destination database.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C, --create <br>
Create the database before restoring into it. If --clean is
also specified, drop and recreate the target database before
connecting to it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When this option is used, the
database named with -d is used only to issue the initial
DROP DATABASE and CREATE DATABASE commands. All data is
restored into the database name <br>
that appears in the archive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d dbname, --dbname=dbname <br>
Connect to database dbname and restore directly into the
database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e, --exit-on-error <br>
Exit if an error is encountered while sending SQL commands
to the database. The default is to continue and to display a
count of errors at the end of the restoration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f filename, --file=filename
<br>
Specify output file for generated script, or for the listing
when used with -l. Default is the standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F format, --format=format <br>
Specify format of the archive. It is not necessary to
specify the format, since pg_restore will determine the
format automatically. If specified, it can be one of the
<br>
following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c, custom <br>
The archive is in the custom format of pg_dump.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">d, directory <br>
The archive is a directory archive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">t, tar <br>
The archive is a tar archive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i, --ignore-version <br>
A deprecated option that is now ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I index, --index=index <br>
Restore definition of named index only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-j number-of-jobs,
--jobs=number-of-jobs <br>
Run the most time-consuming parts of pg_restore &acirc;
those which load data, create indexes, or create constraints
&acirc; using multiple concurrent jobs. This option can
dramatically <br>
reduce the time to restore a large database to a server
running on a multiprocessor machine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each job is one process or one
thread, depending on the operating system, and uses a
separate connection to the server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The optimal value for this
option depends on the hardware setup of the server, of the
client, and of the network. Factors include the number of
CPU cores and the disk setup. <br>
A good place to start is the number of CPU cores on the
server, but values larger than that can also lead to faster
restore times in many cases. Of course, values that are <br>
too high will lead to decreased performance because of
thrashing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Only the custom archive format
is supported with this option. The input file must be a
regular file (not, for example, a pipe). This option is
ignored when emitting a script <br>
rather than connecting directly to a database server. Also,
multiple jobs cannot be used together with the option
--single-transaction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, --list <br>
List the contents of the archive. The output of this
operation can be used as input to the -L option. Note that
if filtering switches such as -n or -t are used with -l,
they <br>
will restrict the items listed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L list-file,
--use-list=list-file <br>
Restore only those archive elements that are listed in
list-file, and restore them in the order they appear in the
file. Note that if filtering switches such as -n or -t are
<br>
used with -L, they will further restrict the items
restored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list-file is normally created by
editing the output of a previous -l operation. Lines can be
moved or removed, and can also be commented out by placing a
semicolon (;) at the <br>
start of the line. See below for examples.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n namespace, --schema=schema
<br>
Restore only objects that are in the named schema. This can
be combined with the -t option to restore just a specific
table.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O, --no-owner <br>
Do not output commands to set ownership of objects to match
the original database. By default, pg_restore issues ALTER
OWNER or SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION statements to set <br>
ownership of created schema elements. These statements will
fail unless the initial connection to the database is made
by a superuser (or the same user that owns all of the <br>
objects in the script). With -O, any user name can be used
for the initial connection, and this user will own all the
created objects.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P function-name(argtype [,
...]), --function=function-name(argtype [, ...]) <br>
Restore the named function only. Be careful to spell the
function name and arguments exactly as they appear in the
dump file&rsquo;s table of contents.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R, --no-reconnect <br>
This option is obsolete but still accepted for backwards
compatibility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --schema-only <br>
Restore only the schema (data definitions), not data, to the
extent that schema entries are present in the archive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is the inverse of
--data-only. It is similar to, but for historical reasons
not identical to, specifying --section=pre-data
--section=post-data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(Do not confuse this with the
--schema option, which uses the word &acirc;schema&acirc; in
a different meaning.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S username,
--superuser=username <br>
Specify the superuser user name to use when disabling
triggers. This is only relevant if --disable-triggers is
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t table, --table=table <br>
Restore definition and/or data of named table only. This can
be combined with the -n option to specify a schema.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T trigger, --trigger=trigger
<br>
Restore named trigger only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
Specifies verbose mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
Print the pg_restore version and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x, --no-privileges, --no-acl
<br>
Prevent restoration of access privileges (grant/revoke
commands).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-1, --single-transaction <br>
Execute the restore as a single transaction (that is, wrap
the emitted commands in BEGIN/COMMIT). This ensures that
either all the commands complete successfully, or no <br>
changes are applied. This option implies
--exit-on-error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--disable-triggers <br>
This option is only relevant when performing a data-only
restore. It instructs pg_restore to execute commands to
temporarily disable triggers on the target tables while the
<br>
data is reloaded. Use this if you have referential integrity
checks or other triggers on the tables that you do not want
to invoke during data reload.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Presently, the commands emitted
for --disable-triggers must be done as superuser. So, you
should also specify a superuser name with -S, or preferably
run pg_restore as a <br>
PostgreSQL superuser.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-data-for-failed-tables <br>
By default, table data is restored even if the creation
command for the table failed (e.g., because it already
exists). With this option, data for such a table is skipped.
<br>
This behavior is useful if the target database already
contains the desired table contents. For example, auxiliary
tables for PostgreSQL extensions such as PostGIS might <br>
already be loaded in the target database; specifying this
option prevents duplicate or obsolete data from being loaded
into them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is effective only
when restoring directly into a database, not when producing
SQL script output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-security-labels <br>
Do not output commands to restore security labels, even if
the archive contains them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-tablespaces <br>
Do not output commands to select tablespaces. With this
option, all objects will be created in whichever tablespace
is the default during restore.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--section=sectionname <br>
Only restore the named section. The section name can be
pre-data, data, or post-data. This option can be specified
more than once to select multiple sections. The default is
<br>
to restore all sections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The data section contains actual
table data as well as large-object definitions. Post-data
items consist of definitions of indexes, triggers, rules and
constraints other than <br>
validated check constraints. Pre-data items consist of all
other data definition items.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--use-set-session-authorization
<br>
Output SQL-standard SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION commands
instead of ALTER OWNER commands to determine object
ownership. This makes the dump more standards-compatible,
but <br>
depending on the history of the objects in the dump, might
not restore properly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-?, --help <br>
Show help about pg_restore command line arguments, and
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pg_restore also accepts the
following command line arguments for connection
parameters:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h host, --host=host <br>
Specifies the host name of the machine on which the server
is running. If the value begins with a slash, it is used as
the directory for the Unix domain socket. The default <br>
is taken from the PGHOST environment variable, if set, else
a Unix domain socket connection is attempted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p port, --port=port <br>
Specifies the TCP port or local Unix domain socket file
extension on which the server is listening for connections.
Defaults to the PGPORT environment variable, if set, or a
<br>
compiled-in default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U username, --username=username
<br>
User name to connect as.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w, --no-password <br>
Never issue a password prompt. If the server requires
password authentication and a password is not available by
other means such as a .pgpass file, the connection attempt
<br>
will fail. This option can be useful in batch jobs and
scripts where no user is present to enter a password.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-W, --password <br>
Force pg_restore to prompt for a password before connecting
to a database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is never essential,
since pg_restore will automatically prompt for a password if
the server demands password authentication. However,
pg_restore will waste a <br>
connection attempt finding out that the server wants a
password. In some cases it is worth typing -W to avoid the
extra connection attempt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--role=rolename <br>
Specifies a role name to be used to perform the restore.
This option causes pg_restore to issue a SET ROLErolename
command after connecting to the database. It is useful when
<br>
the authenticated user (specified by -U) lacks privileges
needed by pg_restore, but can switch to a role with the
required rights. Some installations have a policy against
<br>
logging in directly as a superuser, and use of this option
allows restores to be performed without violating the
policy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
PGHOST, PGOPTIONS, PGPORT, PGUSER <br>
Default connection parameters</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This utility, like most other
PostgreSQL utilities, also uses the environment variables
supported by libpq (see Section 31.14, &acirc;Environment
Variables&acirc;, in the documentation).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
When a direct database connection is specified using the -d
option, pg_restore internally executes SQL statements. If
you have problems running pg_restore, make sure you are able
<br>
to select information from the database using, for example,
psql(1). Also, any default connection settings and
environment variables used by the libpq front-end library
will <br>
apply.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
If your installation has any local additions to the
template1 database, be careful to load the output of
pg_restore into a truly empty database; otherwise you are
likely to get <br>
errors due to duplicate definitions of the added objects. To
make an empty database without any local additions, copy
from template0 not template1, for example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CREATE DATABASE foo WITH
TEMPLATE template0;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The limitations of pg_restore
are detailed below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; When restoring
data to a pre-existing table and the option
--disable-triggers is used, pg_restore emits commands to
disable triggers on user tables before inserting the data,
<br>
then emits commands to re-enable them after the data has
been inserted. If the restore is stopped in the middle, the
system catalogs might be left in the wrong state.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; pg_restore
cannot restore large objects selectively; for instance, only
those for a specific table. If an archive contains large
objects, then all large objects will be <br>
restored, or none of them if they are excluded via -L, -t,
or other options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See also the pg_dump(1)
documentation for details on limitations of pg_dump.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once restored, it is wise to run
ANALYZE on each restored table so the optimizer has useful
statistics; see Section 23.1.3, &acirc;Updating Planner
Statistics&acirc;, in the documentation <br>
and Section 23.1.6, &acirc;The Autovacuum Daemon&acirc;, in
the documentation for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Assume we have dumped a database called mydb into a
custom-format dump file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ pg_dump -Fc mydb &gt;
db.dump</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To drop the database and
recreate it from the dump:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ dropdb mydb <br>
$ pg_restore -C -d postgres db.dump</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The database named in the -d
switch can be any database existing in the cluster;
pg_restore only uses it to issue the CREATE DATABASE command
for mydb. With -C, data is always <br>
restored into the database name that appears in the dump
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To reload the dump into a new
database called newdb:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ createdb -T template0 newdb
<br>
$ pg_restore -d newdb db.dump</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Notice we don&rsquo;t use -C,
and instead connect directly to the database to be restored
into. Also note that we clone the new database from
template0 not template1, to ensure it is <br>
initially empty.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To reorder database items, it is
first necessary to dump the table of contents of the
archive:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ pg_restore -l db.dump &gt;
db.list</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The listing file consists of a
header and one line for each item, e.g.:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">; <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Semicolons start a comment, and
the numbers at the start of lines refer to the internal
archive ID assigned to each item.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Lines in the file can be
commented out, deleted, and reordered. For example:</p>

;8; 145416 TABLE ss_old postgres</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">could be used as input to
pg_restore and would only restore items 10 and 6, in that
order:</p>
