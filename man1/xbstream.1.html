<p>XBSTREAM(1) Percona XtraBackup XBSTREAM(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
xbstream - Percona xbstream Documentation</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To support simultaneous
compression and streaming, a new custom streaming format
called xbstream was introduced to Percona XtraBackup in
addition to the TAR format. That was <br>
required to overcome some limitations of traditional archive
formats such as tar, cpio and others which did not allow
streaming dynamically generated files, for example
dynami&acirc; <br>
cally compressed files. Other advantages of xbstream over
traditional streaming/archive format include ability to
stream multiple files concurrently (so it is possible to use
<br>
streaming in the xbstream format together with the
--parallel option) and more compact data storage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This utility has a tar-like
interface:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; with the
&rsquo;-x&rsquo; option it extracts files from the stream
read from its standard input to the current directory unless
specified otherwise with the &rsquo;-C&rsquo; option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; with the
&rsquo;-c&rsquo; option it streams files specified on the
command line to its standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The utility also tries to
minimize its impact on the OS page cache by using the
appropriate posix_fadvise() calls when available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When compression is enabled with
xtrabackup all data is being compressed, including the
transaction log file and meta data files, using the
specified compression algorithm. The <br>
only currently supported algorithm is &rsquo;quicklz&rsquo;.
The resulting files have the qpress archive format, i.e.
every *.qp file produced by xtrabackup is essentially a
one-file qpress <br>
archive and can be extracted and uncompressed by the qpress
file archiver. This means that there is no need to
uncompress entire backup to restore a single table as with
tar.gz.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Files can be decompressed using
the qpress tool that can be downloaded from here. Qpress
supports multi-threaded decompression.</p>
