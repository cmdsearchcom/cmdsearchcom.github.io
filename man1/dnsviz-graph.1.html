<p>dnsviz-probe(1) General Commands Manual
dnsviz-probe(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
dnsviz-graph - graph the assessment of diagnostic DNS
queries</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
dnsviz graph [ options ] [ domain_name... ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Process the results of diagnostic DNS queries previously
performed, e.g., using dnsviz-probe(1), to assess the health
of the associated DNS deployments for one or more domain
<br>
names specified. The results of this processing are
presented in one of several graphical formats for user
diagnostics.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The source of the diagnostic
query input is either a file specified with -r or standard
input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Domain names to be processed may
be passed either as command-line arguments, in a file (using
the -f option), or simply implied using the diagnostic query
input. The latter is <br>
the preferred methodology (and the simplest) and is useful,
except in cases where the input contains diagnostic queries
for multiple domain names, only a subset of which are to
<br>
be processed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If -f is not used and no domain
names are supplied on the command line, then the domain
names to be processed are extracted from the diagnostic
query input. If the -f option is <br>
used, then names may not be specified on the command
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The domain names passed as input
are fully-qualified domain names, such as example.com,
www.example.com, _443._tcp.example.com,
1.2.0.192.in-addr.arpa, or <br>
8.b.d.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa. Because it is implied that
specified domain names are fully qualified, no trailing dot
is necessary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The graphical output is the
image of a directed graph created using dot(1). The
&quot;html&quot; format makes this image interactive using
javascript libraries that are distributed with <br>
this software.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-f filename <br>
Read names from a file (one name per line), instead of from
command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option is used, then
names may not be specified on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r filename <br>
Read diagnostic query input from the specified file, instead
of from standard input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t filename <br>
Specify a file that contains trusted keys for processing
diagnostic queries. This overrides the default behavior of
using the installed keys for the root zone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The format of this file is
master zone file format and should contain DNSKEY records
that correspond to one more trusted keys for one or more DNS
zones.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option may be used multiple
times on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R type[,type...] <br>
Process queries of only the specified type(s) (e.g., A,
AAAA). The default is to process all types queried as part
of the diagnostic input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O Save the output to a file,
whose name is derived from the format (i.e., provided to -T)
and the domain name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option is used when the
diagnostic queries of multiple domain names are being
processed, a file will be created for each domain name
processed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o filename <br>
Write the output to the specified file instead of to
standard output, which is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option is used when the
diagnostic queries of multiple domain name are being
processed, a single file (the one specified) will be
created, which will contain the <br>
collective output for all domain names processed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T format <br>
Specify the format of the format from among the following:
&quot;dot&quot;, &quot;png&quot;, &quot;jpg&quot;,
&quot;svg&quot;, and &quot;html&quot;. The default is
&quot;dot&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Display the usage and
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT <br>
The conventions used in the graphical format are described
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Zones <br>
Nodes in DNSViz are clustered by the zone to which the
represented information belongs. Each zone is labeled with
the name of the zone origin and the time at which the zone
was <br>
last analyzed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Delegations <br>
Thick lines between zones denote delegations of namespace
from one zone to another, as indicated by the presence of NS
(name server) resource records (RRs) for the delegated <br>
namespace. The status of the delegation is reflected in its
color and style of the edge.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">insecure <br>
A black, solid line between zones indicates a standard,
insecure delegation (i.e., sans DNSSEC).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lame If the designated name
servers for a zone cannot not be properly resolved or if the
servers do not properly respond to queries, then the
delegation is considered lame and <br>
is represented by a dashed, yellow line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">incomplete <br>
If the delegation is incomplete, as indicated by the
presence of NS records in the zone itself but not in its
parent zone, then the delegation is represented by a dashed,
<br>
yellow line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">secure If the delegation is
secure by DNSSEC standards, then then the delegation is
represented by a solid, blue line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bogus If the delegation is bogus
by DNSSEC standards, then then the delegation is represented
by a dashed, red line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RRsets <br>
Resource record sets (RRsets) returned in the response
(usually in the answer section) are represented as
rectangular nodes with rounded corners. Among the most
common record <br>
types are SOA (start of authority), A (IPv4 address), AAAA
(IPv6 address), MX (mail exchange), and CNAME (canonical
name).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RRsets that are specific to
DNSSEC, such as the DNSKEY, DS, RRSIG, NSEC and NSEC3 RR
types, are represented as other node types, as specified
elsewhere in this guide.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Aliases <br>
Aliases resulting from CNAME RRs are represented by a black
edge from one RRset (with the alias name) to another (with
the canonical name).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DNAME <br>
A DNAME RR is used to alias an entire namespace into
another. DNAME responses include synthesized CNAME RRs for
the aliasing directed by the DNAME RR.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DNAME records are shown in
DNSViz with their respective CNAME records. The status of
the CNAME synthesis is reflected color of the edge.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">valid A solid, blue line between
DNAME node and CNAME node indicates that the DNAME expansion
was valid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">invalid <br>
A solid, red line between DNAME node and CNAME node
indicates that the DNAME expansion was invalid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Negative Responses <br>
If the response to a query is a name error (NXDOMAIN), this
negative response is represented by a rectangular node with
diagonals drawn at each corner, and with a dashed border,
<br>
lighter in color. A node representing the SOA RR returned in
the negative response (if any) is also included.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the response to a query has a
NOERROR status but contains no answer data (NO DATA) for the
type, this negative response is represented by a rectangular
node with rounded cor&acirc; <br>
ners, and with a dashed border, lighter in color. A node
representing the SOA RR returned in the negative response
(if any) is also included.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DNSKEY RRs <br>
DNSKEY RRs include public key and meta information to enable
resolvers to validate signatures made by the corresponding
private keys.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In DNSViz, each DNSKEY RR is
represented as an elliptical node in the zone to which it
belongs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each DNSKEY node is decorated
based on the attributes of the corresponding DNSKEY RR.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEP bit <br>
A gray fill indicates that the Secure Entry Point (SEP) bit
is set in the flags field of the DNSKEY RR.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This bit is typically used to
designate a DNSKEY for usage as a key signing key (KSK), a
DNSKEY that is used to sign the DNSKEY RRset of a zone,
providing a secure entry <br>
point into a zone via DS RRs or a trust anchor at the
resolver.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">revoke bit <br>
A thick border indicates that the revoke bit is set in the
flags field of the DNSKEY RR.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Resolvers which implement the
trust anchor rollover procedures documented in RFC 5011
recognize the revoke bit as a signal that the DNSKEY should
no longer be used as a <br>
trust anchor by the resolver. For a DNSKEY to be properly
revoked, it must also be self-signing (i.e., used to sign
the DNSKEY RRset), which proves that the revocation <br>
was made by a party that has access to the private key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">trust anchor <br>
A double border indicates that the DNSKEY has been
designated as a trust anchor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A trust anchor must be
self-signing (i.e., used to sign the DNSKEY RRset).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DS RRs <br>
DS (delegation signer) RRs exist in the parent of a signed
zone to establish a SEP into the zone. Each DS RR specifies
an algorithm and key tag corresponding to a DNSKEY RR in
<br>
the signed zone and includes a cryptographic hash of that
DNSKEY RR.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In DNSViz DS RRs with the same
DNSKEY algorithm and key tag are typically displayed as a
single node since they usually correspond to the same DNSKEY
RR with different digest <br>
algorithms. The status of the DS RRs is reflected in the
color and style of the edge.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">valid A blue-colored arrow
pointing from DS to DNSKEY indicates that the digest
contained in each of the DS RRs is valid, and corresponds to
an existing DNSKEY.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">invalid digest <br>
A solid red line from DS to DNSKEY indicates that a DNSKEY
exists matching the algorithm and key tag of the DS RR, but
the digest of the DNSKEY in the DS RR does not <br>
match.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">indeterminate - no DNSKEY <br>
A dashed gray line from DS to a DNSKEY with a dashed gray
border indicates that no DNSKEY matching the algorithm and
key tag of the DS RR exists in the child zone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Extraneous DS RRs in a parent
zone do not, in and of themselves, constitute an error. For
example, sometimes they are deliberately pre-published
before their corresponding <br>
DNSKEYs, as part of a key rollover. However, for every
DNSSEC algorithm in the DS RRset for the child zone, a
matching DNSKEY must be used to sign the DNSKEY RRset in the
<br>
child zone, as per RFC 4035.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">indeterminate - match pre-revoke
<br>
A special case of a DS with no matching DNSKEY is when the
DS matched a DNSKEY prior to its revocation, but the
ramifications are the same as if it didn&rsquo;t match any
<br>
DNSKEY. The line is simply drawn to help identify the cause
of the otherwise non-existent DNSKEY.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">indeterminate - unknown
algorithm <br>
When the algorithm and key tag of a DS RR match those of a
DNSKEY RR, but the digest algorithm is unknown or
unsupported, then the line between DS and DNSKEY is
yellow.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">invalid <br>
When the use of a DS corresponding to a DNSKEY is invalid,
independent of the correctness of its digest, the line
between DS and DNSKEY is red and dashed. An example
sce&acirc; <br>
nario is when the DNSKEY has the revoke bit set, which is
disallowed by RFC 5011.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NSEC/NSEC3 RRs <br>
NSEC and NSEC3 RRs are used within DNSSEC to prove the
legitimacy of a negative response (i.e., NXDOMAIN or NO
DATA) using authenticated denial of existence or hashed
authenti&acirc; <br>
cated denial of existence, respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In DNSViz the NSEC or NSEC3
RR(s) returned by a server to authenticate a negative
response are represented by a rectangular node with several
compartments. The bottom compartment <br>
is labeled with either NSEC or NSEC3, depending on the type
of record. Each compartment on the top row represents an
NSEC or NSEC3 record in the set--there will be between one
<br>
and three.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An edge extends from the NSEC or
NSEC3 node to the corresponding negative response. Its
status is reflected in the color and style of the edge.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">valid If the edge is solid blue,
then the NSEC or NSEC3 RRs returned prove the validity of
the negative response.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">invalid <br>
A solid red edge from the NSEC or NSEC3 node to the negative
response indicates that the NSEC or NSEC3 RRs included in in
the response do not prove the validity of the <br>
negative response.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A special case of NSEC/NSEC3 RRs
is that in which they serve to prove the non-existence of
Delegation Signer (DS) records. The proof of absence of DS
records constitutes an <br>
insecure delegation, in which any trust at the parent zone
does not propagate to the child zone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The NSEC/NSEC3 proof involving
DS records is graphically represented with an edge from the
NSEC/NSEC3 node to the box representing the child zone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The opt-out flag is set in NSEC3
RRs to indicate that their presence is only sufficient to
prove insecure delegations (i.e., lack of DS records) and
nothing more. Thus, a name <br>
error (NXDOMAIN) response, for example, cannot be securely
proven when the NSEC3 uses opt-out.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NSEC3 records with the opt-out
flag set are colored with a gray background.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RRSIGs <br>
Each RRSIG RR contains the cryptographic signature made by a
DNSKEY over an RRset. Using the DNSKEY with the same
algorithm and key tag as the RRSIG, the RRset which was
signed, <br>
and the RRSIG itself, a resolver may determine the
correctness of the signature and authenticate the RRset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In DNSViz RRSIGs are represented
as directed edges from the DNSKEY that made the signature to
the RRset that was signed. The status of the edge is
reflected in its color and <br>
style.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">valid A solid blue edge
indicates that an RRSIG is valid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">invalid signature <br>
A solid red edge indicates an RRSIG in which the
cryptographic signature is invalid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">expired or premature <br>
A solid purple edge indicates that an RRSIG is invalid
because it is outside its validity period, as defined by the
inception and expiration date fields in the RRSIG RR.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">indeterminate - no DNSKEY <br>
A dashed gray line stemming from a DNSKEY with a dashed gray
border indicates that no DNSKEY matching the algorithm and
key tag of the RRSIG RR could be found in the <br>
DNSKEY RRset (or the DNSKEY RRset could not be
retrieved).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Extraneous RRSIG RRs do not, in
and of themselves, constitute an error. For example,
sometimes they are deliberately pre-published before their
corresponding DNSKEYs, as <br>
part of an algorithm rollover. However, every RRset must be
covered by RRSIGs for every algorithm in the DNSKEY RRset,
as per RFC 4035.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">indeterminate - match pre-revoke
<br>
A special case of an RRSIG with no matching DNSKEY is when
the RRSIG matched a DNSKEY prior to its revocation, but the
ramifications are the same as if it didn&rsquo;t match any
<br>
DNSKEY. The line is simply drawn to help identify the cause
of the otherwise non-existent DNSKEY.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">indeterminate - unknown
algorithm <br>
When the algorithm and key tag of an RRSIG RR match those of
a DNSKEY RR, but the cryptographic algorithm associated with
the RRSIG is unknown or unsupported, then the <br>
line stemming from the DNSKEY is yellow.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">invalid <br>
When an RRSIG is invalid, independent of the correctness of
its temporal validity period and its cryptographic
signature, the line stemming from the DNSKEY is red and <br>
dashed. Example scenarios might be when the DNSKEY has the
revoke bit set or when the signer field in the RRSIG RR does
not match the name of the zone apex. Such scenar&acirc; <br>
ios are disallowed by RFCs 5011 and 4035, respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Just like other RRsets, a DNSKEY
RRset is signed as an RRset, which comprises all the
collective DNSKEY RRs at the zone apex. Because each DNSKEY
RR is represented as a node in <br>
DNSViz, a single RRSIG covering the DNSKEY RRset is
represented by edges drawn from the node representing the
signing DNSKEY to the nodes representing every DNSKEY RR in
the set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In some DNSSEC implementations,
multiple DNSKEYs sign the DNSKEY RRset, even though only a
subset are designated to provide secure entry into the zone
(e.g., via matching DS <br>
records in the parent zone). While there is nothing
inherently wrong with this configuration, graphically
representing such scenarios can be visually complex because
of the <br>
cycles and redundancy created in the graph.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to represent trust
propagation in a simplified fashion, eliminating graphic
redundancies, DNSViz exhibits the following behavior. For
every DNSKEY signing the DNSKEY <br>
RRset, a self-directed edge is added to the node, indicating
that the DNSKEY is self-signing. Additionally, if the DNSKEY
is designated as a (SEP) into the zone, then edges are <br>
drawn from its node to nodes representing all other DNSKEY
RRs in the DNSKEY RRset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If there is no true SEP, (e.g.,
no DS RRs in the parent zone), then SEP(s) are inferred
based on their signing role (e.g., siging DNSKEY RRset or
other RRsets) and properties <br>
(e.g., SEP bit).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Like the DNSKEY RRset, a single
DS RRset might be represented as several different nodes. As
such a single RRSIG covering the DS RRset is represented by
edges drawn from the <br>
node representing the signing DNSKEY to the nodes
representing every DS RR in the set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Because an NSEC or NSEC3 node
represents one or more RRsets and at least one RRSIG per
RRset is anticipated, multiple RRSIG edges will be drawn
from DNSKEY to NSEC or NSEC3 <br>
nodes, each pointing to the respective compartment
corresponding to the NSEC or NSEC3 record.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Wildcards <br>
When the RRSIG covering an RRset has a labels field with
value greater than the number of labels in the name, it is
indicative that the resulting RRset was formed by a wildcard
<br>
expansion. The server must additionally include an NSEC or
NSEC3 proof that the name to which the wildcard is expanded
does not exist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DNSViz represents wildcards by
displaying both the wildcard RRset and the NSEC or NSEC3
proof.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Node Status <br>
Beginning at the DNSKEYs designated as trust anchors, DNSViz
traverses the nodes and edges in the graph to classify each
node as having one of three DNSSEC statuses, depending on
<br>
the status of the RRset which it represents: secure, bogus,
or insecure. In DNSViz, node status is indicated by the
color of the nodes (Note that there isn&rsquo;t always a
one-to-one <br>
mapping between node and RRset, but the node status will be
consistent among all nodes comprising an RRset. An example
is the DNSKEY nodes for a zone, which all have the same <br>
status even though the DNSKEY RRset is split among different
nodes).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The status of a node is
reflected in the color of its outline.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">secure Nodes with blue outline
indicate that they are secure, that there is an unbroken
chain of trust from anchor to RRset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bogus Nodes with red outline
indicate that they are bogus, that the chain of trust from
an anchor has been broken.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Because the NSEC and NSEC3 nodes
often represent multiple NSEC or NSEC3 RRs, it is possible
that a proper subset of the RRs are secure, while others in
the set are not <br>
(e.g., missing or expired RRSIG). In this case, the outline
of the compartments representing secure NSEC or NSEC3 RRs
will be colored blue, while the others will be red. <br>
Because the status of the collective set of NSEC and NSEC3
RRs is dependent on the status of all the individual NSEC
and NSEC3 RRs, the greater node is only colored blue <br>
if all the compartments are colored blue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">insecure <br>
Nodes with black outline indicate that they are insecure,
that no chain of trust exists; if any anchors exist then an
insecure delegation is demonstrated to prove that no <br>
chain should exist from the anchors. This is equivalent to
DNS without DNSSEC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warnings and Errors <br>
If one or more warnings are detected with the data
represented by a node in the graph, then a warning icon is
displayed in the node.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Similarly, the warning icon is
displayed alongside edges whose represented data has
warnings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If one or more errors (more
severe than warnings) are detected with the data represented
by a node in the graph, then an error icon is displayed in
the node.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Similarly, the error icon is
displayed alongside edges whose represented data has
errors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A warning icon with an
italicized label denotes a warning for a response that
isn&rsquo;t represented elsewhere in the graph, such as a
referral with the authoritative answer flag set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An error icon with an italicized
label denotes a response error, e.g., due to timeout,
malformed response, or invalid RCODE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT CODES <br>
The exit codes are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 Program terminated
normally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 Incorrect usage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 Required package dependencies
were not found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3 There was an error processing
the input or saving the output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4 Program execution was
interrupted, or an unknown error ocurred.</p>
