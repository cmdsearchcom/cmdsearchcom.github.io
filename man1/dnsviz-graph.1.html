<b>dnsviz</b> <b>graph</b> [ <i>options</i> ] [ <i>domain_name...</i> ]
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
Process the results of diagnostic DNS queries previously performed, e.g., using
  <b>dnsviz-probe(1)</b>, to assess the health of the associated DNS deployments
  for one or more domain names specified. The results of this processing are
  presented in one of several graphical formats for user diagnostics.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The source of the diagnostic query input is either a file specified with
  <b>-r</b> or standard input.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Domain names to be processed may be passed either as command-line arguments, in
  a file (using the <b>-f</b> option), or simply implied using the diagnostic
  query input. The latter is the preferred methodology (and the simplest) and is
  useful, except in cases where the input contains diagnostic queries for
  multiple domain names, only a subset of which are to be processed.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If <b>-f</b> is not used and no domain names are supplied on the command line,
  then the domain names to be processed are extracted from the diagnostic query
  input. If the <b>-f</b> option is used, then names may not be specified on the
  command line.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The domain names passed as input are fully-qualified domain names, such as
  example.com, www.example.com, _443._tcp.example.com, 1.2.0.192.in-addr.arpa,
  or 8.b.d.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa. Because it is implied that specified domain names
  are fully qualified, no trailing dot is necessary.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The graphical output is the image of a directed graph created using
  <b>dot(1)</b>. The &quot;html&quot; format makes this image interactive using
  javascript libraries that are distributed with this software.

Resource record sets (RRsets) returned in the response (usually in the answer
  section) are represented as rectangular nodes with rounded corners. Among the
  most common record types are SOA (start of authority), A (IPv4 address), AAAA
  (IPv6 address), MX (mail exchange), and CNAME (canonical name).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
RRsets that are specific to DNSSEC, such as the DNSKEY, DS, RRSIG, NSEC and

<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="DNAME"><a class="selflink" href="#DNAME">DNAME</a></h2>
A DNAME RR is used to alias an entire namespace into another. DNAME responses

  returned in the negative response (if any) is also included.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If the response to a query has a NOERROR status but contains no answer data (NO

DNSKEY RRs include public key and meta information to enable resolvers to

<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
In DNSViz, each DNSKEY RR is represented as an elliptical node in the zone to

<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Each DNSKEY node is decorated based on the attributes of the corresponding

    This bit is typically used to designate a DNSKEY for usage as a key signing
      key (KSK), a DNSKEY that is used to sign the DNSKEY RRset of a zone,
      providing a secure entry point into a zone via DS RRs or a trust anchor at

    Resolvers which implement the trust anchor rollover procedures documented in
      RFC 5011 recognize the revoke bit as a signal that the DNSKEY should no
      longer be used as a trust anchor by the resolver. For a DNSKEY to be
      properly revoked, it must also be self-signing (i.e., used to sign the

DS (delegation signer) RRs exist in the parent of a signed zone to establish a

  DNSKEY RR.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
In DNSViz DS RRs with the same DNSKEY algorithm and key tag are typically

<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
In DNSViz the NSEC or NSEC3 RR(s) returned by a server to authenticate a

A special case of NSEC/NSEC3 RRs is that in which they serve to prove the

The NSEC/NSEC3 proof involving DS records is graphically represented with an

The opt-out flag is set in NSEC3 RRs to indicate that their presence is only
  sufficient to prove insecure delegations (i.e., lack of DS records) and
  nothing more. Thus, a name error (NXDOMAIN) response, for example, cannot be
  securely proven when the NSEC3 uses opt-out.

Just like other RRsets, a DNSKEY RRset is signed as an RRset, which comprises

  (e.g., via matching DS records in the parent zone). While there is nothing
  inherently wrong with this configuration, graphically representing such
  scenarios can be visually complex because of the cycles and redundancy created
  in the graph.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
In order to represent trust propagation in a simplified fashion, eliminating
  graphic redundancies, DNSViz exhibits the following behavior. For every DNSKEY
  signing the DNSKEY RRset, a self-directed edge is added to the node,
  indicating that the DNSKEY is self-signing. Additionally, if the DNSKEY is
  designated as a (SEP) into the zone, then edges are drawn from its node to
  nodes representing all other DNSKEY RRs in the DNSKEY RRset.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If there is no true SEP, (e.g., no DS RRs in the parent zone), then SEP(s) are
  inferred based on their signing role (e.g., siging DNSKEY RRset or other
  RRsets) and properties (e.g., SEP bit).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Like the DNSKEY RRset, a single DS RRset might be represented as several
  different nodes. As such a single RRSIG covering the DS RRset is represented
  by edges drawn from the node representing the signing DNSKEY to the nodes
  representing every DS RR in the set.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Because an NSEC or NSEC3 node represents one or more RRsets and at least one
  RRSIG per RRset is anticipated, multiple RRSIG edges will be drawn from DNSKEY
  to NSEC or NSEC3 nodes, each pointing to the respective compartment
  corresponding to the NSEC or NSEC3 record.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Wildcards"><a class="selflink" href="#Wildcards">Wildcards</a></h2>
When the RRSIG covering an RRset has a labels field with value greater than the
  number of labels in the name, it is indicative that the resulting RRset was
  formed by a wildcard expansion. The server must additionally include an NSEC
  or NSEC3 proof that the name to which the wildcard is expanded does not exist.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
DNSViz represents wildcards by displaying both the wildcard RRset and the NSEC
  or NSEC3 proof.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Node_Status"><a class="selflink" href="#Node_Status">Node
  Status</a></h2>
Beginning at the DNSKEYs designated as trust anchors, DNSViz traverses the nodes
  and edges in the graph to classify each node as having one of three DNSSEC
  statuses, depending on the status of the RRset which it represents: secure,
  bogus, or insecure. In DNSViz, node status is indicated by the color of the
  nodes (Note that there isn't always a one-to-one mapping between node and
  RRset, but the node status will be consistent among all nodes comprising an
  RRset. An example is the DNSKEY nodes for a zone, which all have the same
  status even though the DNSKEY RRset is split among different nodes).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The status of a node is reflected in the color of its outline.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">secure</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Nodes with blue outline indicate that they are secure, that
      there is an unbroken chain of trust from anchor to RRset.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
  </dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">bogus</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Nodes with red outline indicate that they are bogus, that
      the chain of trust from an anchor has been broken.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Because the NSEC and NSEC3 nodes often represent multiple NSEC or NSEC3 RRs,
      it is possible that a proper subset of the RRs are secure, while others in
      the set are not (e.g., missing or expired RRSIG). In this case, the
      outline of the compartments representing secure NSEC or NSEC3 RRs will be
      colored blue, while the others will be red. Because the status of the
      collective set of NSEC and NSEC3 RRs is dependent on the status of all the
      individual NSEC and NSEC3 RRs, the greater node is only colored blue if
      all the compartments are colored blue.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
  </dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">insecure</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Nodes with black outline indicate that they are insecure,
      that no chain of trust exists; if any anchors exist then an insecure
      delegation is demonstrated to prove that no chain should exist from the
      anchors. This is equivalent to DNS without DNSSEC.

<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Warnings_and_Errors"><a class="selflink" href="#Warnings_and_Errors">Warnings
  and Errors</a></h2>
If one or more warnings are detected with the data represented by a node in the
  graph, then a warning icon is displayed in the node.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Similarly, the warning icon is displayed alongside edges whose represented data
  has warnings.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If one or more errors (more severe than warnings) are detected with the data
  represented by a node in the graph, then an error icon is displayed in the
  node.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Similarly, the error icon is displayed alongside edges whose represented data
  has errors.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
A warning icon with an italicized label denotes a warning for a response that
  isn't represented elsewhere in the graph, such as a referral with the
  authoritative answer flag set.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
An error icon with an italicized label denotes a response error, e.g., due to
  timeout, malformed response, or invalid RCODE.
