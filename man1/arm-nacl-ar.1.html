<p>AR(1) GNU Development Tools AR(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ar - create, modify, and extract from archives</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ar [-X32_64] [-]p[mod] [--plugin name] [--target bfdname]
[relpos] [count] archive [member...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The GNU ar program creates, modifies, and extracts from
archives. An archive is a single file holding a collection
of other files in a structure that makes it possible to <br>
retrieve the original individual files (called members of
the archive).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The original files&rsquo;
contents, mode (permissions), timestamp, owner, and group
are preserved in the archive, and can be restored on
extraction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GNU ar can maintain archives
whose members have names of any length; however, depending
on how ar is configured on your system, a limit on
member-name length may be imposed for <br>
compatibility with archive formats maintained with other
tools. If it exists, the limit is often 15 characters
(typical of formats related to a.out) or 16 characters
(typical of <br>
formats related to coff).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ar is considered a binary
utility because archives of this sort are most often used as
libraries holding commonly needed subroutines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ar creates an index to the
symbols defined in relocatable object modules in the archive
when you specify the modifier s. Once created, this index is
updated in the archive <br>
whenever ar makes a change to its contents (save for the q
update operation). An archive with such an index speeds up
linking to the library, and allows routines in the library
<br>
to call each other without regard to their placement in the
archive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may use nm -s or nm
--print-armap to list this index table. If an archive lacks
the table, another form of ar called ranlib can be used to
add just the table.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GNU ar can optionally create a
thin archive, which contains a symbol index and references
to the original copies of the member files of the archive.
This is useful for building <br>
libraries for use within a local build tree, where the
relocatable objects are expected to remain available, and
copying the contents of each object would only waste time
and <br>
space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An archive can either be thin or
it can be normal. It cannot be both at the same time. Once
an archive is created its format cannot be changed without
first deleting it and <br>
then creating a new archive in its place.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Thin archives are also
flattened, so that adding one thin archive to another thin
archive does not nest it, as would happen with a normal
archive. Instead the elements of the <br>
first archive are added individually to the second
archive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The paths to the elements of the
archive are stored relative to the archive itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GNU ar is designed to be
compatible with two different facilities. You can control
its activity using command-line options, like the different
varieties of ar on Unix systems; <br>
or, if you specify the single command-line option -M, you
can control it with a script supplied via standard input,
like the MRI &quot;librarian&quot; program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
GNU ar allows you to mix the operation code p and modifier
flags mod in any order, within the first command-line
argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you wish, you may begin the
first command-line argument with a dash.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The p keyletter specifies what
operation to execute; it may be any of the following, but
you must specify only one of them:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">d Delete modules from the
archive. Specify the names of modules to be deleted as
member...; the archive is untouched if you specify no files
to delete.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you specify the v modifier,
ar lists each module as it is deleted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">m Use this operation to move
members in an archive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ordering of members in an
archive can make a difference in how programs are linked
using the library, if a symbol is defined in more than one
member.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no modifiers are used with
&quot;m&quot;, any members you name in the member arguments
are moved to the end of the archive; you can use the a, b,
or i modifiers to move them to a <br>
specified place instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">p Print the specified members of
the archive, to the standard output file. If the v modifier
is specified, show the member name before copying its
contents to standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you specify no member
arguments, all the files in the archive are printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">q Quick append; Historically,
add the files member... to the end of archive, without
checking for replacement.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The modifiers a, b, and i do not
affect this operation; new members are always placed at the
end of the archive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The modifier v makes ar list
each file as it is appended.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since the point of this
operation is speed, implementations of ar have the option of
not updating the archive&rsquo;s symbol table if one exists.
Too many different systems <br>
however assume that symbol tables are always up-to-date, so
GNU ar will rebuild the table even with a quick append.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note - GNU ar treats the command
qs as a synonym for r - replacing already existing files in
the archive and appending new ones at the end.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">r Insert the files member...
into archive (with replacement). This operation differs from
q in that any previously existing members are deleted if
their names match those being <br>
added.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If one of the files named in
member... does not exist, ar displays an error message, and
leaves undisturbed any existing members of the archive
matching that name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, new members are
added at the end of the file; but you may use one of the
modifiers a, b, or i to request placement relative to some
existing member.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The modifier v used with this
operation elicits a line of output for each file inserted,
along with one of the letters a or r to indicate whether the
file was appended (no <br>
old member deleted) or replaced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">s Add an index to the archive,
or update it if it already exists. Note this command is an
exception to the rule that there can only be one command
letter, as it is possible to <br>
use it as either a command or a modifier. In either case it
does the same thing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">t Display a table listing the
contents of archive, or those of the files listed in
member... that are present in the archive. Normally only the
member name is shown; if you <br>
also want to see the modes (permissions), timestamp, owner,
group, and size, you can request that by also specifying the
v modifier.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you do not specify a member,
all files in the archive are listed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If there is more than one file
with the same name (say, fie) in an archive (say b.a), ar t
b.a fie lists only the first instance; to see them all, you
must ask for a complete <br>
listing---in our example, ar t b.a.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">x Extract members (named member)
from the archive. You can use the v modifier with this
operation, to request that ar list each name as it extracts
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you do not specify a member,
all files in the archive are extracted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Files cannot be extracted from a
thin archive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help <br>
Displays the list of command line options supported by ar
and then exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Displays the version information of ar and then exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A number of modifiers (mod) may
immediately follow the p keyletter, to specify variations on
an operation&rsquo;s behavior:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a Add new files after an
existing member of the archive. If you use the modifier a,
the name of an existing archive member must be present as
the relpos argument, before the <br>
archive specification.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">b Add new files before an
existing member of the archive. If you use the modifier b,
the name of an existing archive member must be present as
the relpos argument, before the <br>
archive specification. (same as i).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c Create the archive. The
specified archive is always created if it did not exist,
when you request an update. But a warning is issued unless
you specify in advance that you <br>
expect to create it, by using this modifier.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">D Operate in deterministic mode.
When adding files and the archive index use zero for UIDs,
GIDs, timestamps, and use consistent file modes for all
files. When this option is <br>
used, if ar is used with identical options and identical
input files, multiple runs will create identical output
files regardless of the input files&rsquo; owners, groups,
file <br>
modes, or modification times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If binutils was configured with
--enable-deterministic-archives, then this mode is on by
default. It can be disabled with the U modifier, below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f Truncate names in the archive.
GNU ar will normally permit file names of any length. This
will cause it to create archives which are not compatible
with the native ar <br>
program on some systems. If this is a concern, the f
modifier may be used to truncate file names when putting
them in the archive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">i Insert new files before an
existing member of the archive. If you use the modifier i,
the name of an existing archive member must be present as
the relpos argument, before <br>
the archive specification. (same as b).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">l This modifier is accepted but
not used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">N Uses the count parameter. This
is used if there are multiple entries in the archive with
the same name. Extract or delete instance count of the given
name from the archive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Preserve the original dates of
members when extracting them. If you do not specify this
modifier, files extracted from the archive are stamped with
the time of extraction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">P Use the full path name when
matching names in the archive. GNU ar can not create an
archive with a full path name (such archives are not POSIX
complaint), but other archive <br>
creators can. This option will cause GNU ar to match file
names using a complete path name, which can be convenient
when extracting a single file from an archive created by
<br>
another tool.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">s Write an object-file index
into the archive, or update an existing one, even if no
other change is made to the archive. You may use this
modifier flag either with any <br>
operation, or alone. Running ar s on an archive is
equivalent to running ranlib on it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">S Do not generate an archive
symbol table. This can speed up building a large library in
several steps. The resulting archive can not be used with
the linker. In order to <br>
build a symbol table, you must omit the S modifier on the
last execution of ar, or you must run ranlib on the
archive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">T Make the specified archive a
thin archive. If it already exists and is a regular archive,
the existing members must be present in the same directory
as archive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">u Normally, ar r... inserts all
files listed into the archive. If you would like to insert
only those of the files you list that are newer than
existing members of the same <br>
names, use this modifier. The u modifier is allowed only for
the operation r (replace). In particular, the combination qu
is not allowed, since checking the timestamps <br>
would lose any speed advantage from the operation q.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">U Do not operate in
deterministic mode. This is the inverse of the D modifier,
above: added files and the archive index will get their
actual UID, GID, timestamp, and file <br>
mode values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is the default unless
binutils was configured with
--enable-deterministic-archives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">v This modifier requests the
verbose version of an operation. Many operations display
additional information, such as filenames processed, when
the modifier v is appended.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">V This modifier shows the
version number of ar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ar ignores an initial option
spelt -X32_64, for compatibility with AIX. The behaviour
produced by this option is the default for GNU ar. ar does
not support any of the other -X <br>
options; in particular, it does not support -X32 which is
the default for AIX ar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The optional command line switch
--plugin name causes ar to load the plugin called name which
adds support for more file formats. This option is only
available if the toolchain <br>
has been built with plugin support enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The optional command line switch
--target bfdname specifies that the archive members are in
an object code format different from your system&rsquo;s
default format. See</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@file <br>
Read command-line options from file. The options read are
inserted in place of the original @file option. If file does
not exist, or cannot be read, then the option will be <br>
treated literally, and not removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options in file are separated by
whitespace. A whitespace character may be included in an
option by surrounding the entire option in either single or
double quotes. Any <br>
character (including a backslash) may be included by
prefixing the character to be included with a backslash. The
file may itself contain additional @file options; any such
<br>
options will be processed recursively.</p>
