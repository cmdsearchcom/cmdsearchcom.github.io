<p>HXCITE(1) HTML-XML-utils HXCITE(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
hxcite - replace bibliographic references by hyperlinks</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
hxcite [ -b base ] [ -p pattern ] [ -a auxfile ] [ -m marker
] [ -c ] bibfile [ file ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The hxcite commands copies the file to standard output,
looking for strings of the form [[label]]. The label may not
include white space and the double pair of square brackets
<br>
must enclose the label without any spaces in between. If
hxcite finds the label in the bibfile, the string is
replaced by the pattern. The pattern can include certain
variables. <br>
If the label is not found in bibfile, it is left
unchanged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default pattern replaces the
string with a hyperlink, but if the -p option is used, the
replacement can be any pattern. The input doesn&rsquo;t even
have to be HTML.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the label is enclosed in
{{...}} instead of [[...]], it is copied to the output
unchanged and not replaced by the pattern, but the label is
still searched in the bibfile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The following options are supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p pattern <br>
Specifies the pattern by which the string [[label]] is
replaced. The pattern may include the variables %b (which is
replaced by the value of the -b option), %m (which <br>
is replaced by the value of the -m option) and %L (which is
replaced by the label). The default pattern is</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;a href=&quot;%b#%L&quot;
rel=&quot;biblioentry&quot;&gt;[%L]&lt;!--{{%m%L}}--&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b base Sets the value for the
%b variable in the pattern. Typically this is set to a
relative or absolute URL. By default this value is an empty
string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a auxfile <br>
All labels that have been found and replaced are also
written to a file. This is so that hxmkbib(1) can find them
and create a bibliography. The default auxfile is con&acirc;
<br>
structed from the name of the file by removing the last
extension (if any) and replacing it by &quot;.aux&quot;. If
no file is given, the default name is
&quot;aux.aux&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m marker By default, the
program looks for &quot;[[name]]&quot;, but it can be made
to look for &quot;[[#name]]&quot; where # is some string,
usually a symbol such as &rsquo;!&rsquo; or &rsquo;=&rsquo;.
This allows refer&acirc; <br>
ences to be classified, e.g., &quot;[[!name]]&quot; for
normative references and &quot;[[name]]&quot; for
non-normative references.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Causes &quot;[[name]]&quot;
to be ignored when it occurs inside XML comments
(&quot;&lt;!--...--&gt;&quot;). This is useful for files
where such labels occur in comments, to avoid that they be
<br>
expanded and possibly lead to invalid output; useful also if
hxcite is used for non-HTML files which may contain
&quot;&lt;!--&quot; that are not comment. Occurrences of
&quot;{{name}}&quot; <br>
are not affected by -c. (But see warning under BUGS
below.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERANDS <br>
The following operands are supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bibfile The name of a
bibliographic database must be given. It must be a file in
refer(1) format and every entry must have at least a %L
field, which is used as label. (Entries <br>
without such a field will be ignored.) Entries may
optionally have a %K line, which should contain
whitespace-separated keywords. Those keywords can be used to
refer to <br>
the entry instead of the label. Thus the foo in [[foo]] can
either be the label of an entry (%L line) or one of the
keywords of the entry&rsquo;s %K line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file The name of the input file
is optional. If absent, hxcite will read from stdin. The
file does not have to be an HTML file, but the default
pattern (see the -p option) <br>
assumes HTML.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The following exit values are returned:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 Successful completion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt; 0 An error occurred.
Usually this is because a file could not be opened. Very
rarely it may also be an out of memory error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VERSIONS <br>
March 2000: created by Bert Bos &lt;bert@w3.org&gt; as
&quot;cite&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">August 2008: renamed to
&quot;hxcite&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Currently maintained by Bert
Bos.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
hxcite does not actually parse HTML or XML input and the -c
option simply treats every occurence of &quot;&lt;!--&quot;
as the start of an XML comment, even if it occurs inside an
attribute <br>
value or a CDATA section. Likewise for &quot;--&gt;&quot;
for the end of a comment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is currently no way to use
numbers for references (e.g., &quot;[1]&quot;,
&quot;[2]&quot;) instead of the labels
(&quot;[Lie1996]&quot;, &quot;[UTN22]&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hxcite requires the %L (label)
field to be present in every entry in bibfile, which is not
the case for refer(1). hxcite does not implement
refer&rsquo;s keyword search.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLE <br>
The following looks for reference of the form
&quot;[[!label]]&quot; in &quot;myfile.html&quot;, skipping
references that occur inside HTML comments, and looks up the
labels in &quot;biblio.ref&quot;. The <br>
output is written to &quot;new.html&quot; and the list of
recognized labels to &quot;myfile.aux&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hxcite -c -m &rsquo;!&rsquo;
biblio.ref myfile.html &gt; new.html</p>
