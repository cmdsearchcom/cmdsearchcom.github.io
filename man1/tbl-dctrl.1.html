<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
tbl-dctrl - generate tabular representations of data in
dctrl format</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
tbl-dctrl [ options ] [ -c column-specification ... ] [
filename ] ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tbl-dctrl --version</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tbl-dctrl --help</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
tbl-dctrl creates tabular representations of data given to
it in Debian control file format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, tbl-dctrl reads the
whole database, looking for the longest entry in each
requested column; it then outputs a table, with borders and
column titles, where each column <br>
is just wide enough to fit the longest entry. Most of this
behaviour can be customized as described below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A column is requested by
specifying the -c (--column) switch with a column
specification. The simplest kind of a column specification
consists solely of the name of a field. In <br>
such a case, tbl-dctrl will include in the output a column
whose title is the literal column specification and whose
data is drawn from fields with that name. If no -c options
<br>
are given, tbl-dctrl will use all fields in the input in the
order in which they first appear.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are two optional additions
one can make to a column specification. Prefixing the field
name with some text followed by an equality sign (for
example, -c &rsquo;Package <br>
name=Package&rsquo;) modifies the column in such a way that
the text before the equality sign is used as the column
title, while the text after the equality sign is used as the
name of <br>
the field from which data is drawn. One can also append a
colon followed by a positive whole number to the field name.
In such a case, the number after the colon specifies the
<br>
width of the column. These two additions can be used
separately or together. If there are more than one colon,
the last one is significant. If there are more than one
equals <br>
sign, the first one is significant. Other colons and equals
signs are used simply as data. Note that the whole column
specification must be given to tbl-dctrl as one argument,
<br>
so if it contains spaces, it must be quoted for the
shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If all requested columns have a
specified width, tbl-dctrl will produce output immediately,
not waiting for the whole input to be read in.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-d delimiter, --delimiter=delimiter <br>
Instead of drawing nice borders to the table, use the
specified delimiter string to delimit columns in a row.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H, --no-heading <br>
Do not print a table heading (column titles).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l level, --errorlevel=level
<br>
Set log level to level. level is one of fatal, important,
informational and debug, but the last may not be available,
depending on the compile-time options. These cate&acirc;
<br>
gories are given here in order; every message that is
emitted when fatal is in effect, will be emitted in the
important error level, and so on. The default is
important.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
Print out version information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C, --copying <br>
Print out the copyright license. This produces much output;
be sure to redirect or pipe it somewhere (such as your
favourite pager).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Print out a help summary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERANDS <br>
tbl-dctrl will read its input from the files named on the
command line, in the specified order. A file called -
represents the program&rsquo;s standard input stream. If no
files are <br>
named, the program behaves as if - alone had been named,
that is, input is read from the standard input stream.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDIN <br>
The standard input stream may be used as input as specified
above in the OPERANDS section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUT FILES <br>
All input to tbl-dctrl is in the format of a Debian control
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A Debian control (dctrl) file is
a semistructured single-table database stored in a
machine-parseable text file. Such a database consists of a
set of records; each record is a <br>
mapping from field names to field content. Textually,
records are separated by empty lines, while each field is
encoded as one or more nonempty lines inside a record. A
field <br>
starts with its name, followed by a colon, followed by the
field content. The colon must reside on the first line of
the field, and the first line must start with no whitespace.
<br>
Subsequent lines, in contrast, always start with linear
whitespace (one or more space or tab characters).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When input is read from multiple
files, a record separator is implicit between two adjacent
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
The standard locale environment, specifically its character
set setting, affects the interpretation of input and output
as character streams.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS <br>
Standard UNIX signals have their usual meaning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDOUT <br>
All output is sent to the standard output stream. The output
is a tabular representation of the input database restricted
to the specified fields. Logically, the output is a <br>
table; when the -d option is used, this table is represented
simply by separating columns in each row by the specified
delimiter; when the option is not used, a frame is drawn
<br>
around the table. The order of the columns is the same as
the order of the column specifications on the command
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT FILES <br>
There are no output files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
This utility exits with 0 when successful. It uses a nonzero
exit code inconsistently when an error is noticed (this is a
bug).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS <br>
In case of errors in the input, the output will be partially
or completely garbage. In case of errors in invocation, the
program will refuse to function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
The following command line pipe outputs a table of all
packages, with their maintainer data, sorted by the
maintainer data, that have no content: <br>
% grep-available -FInstalled-Size --eq 0 | sort-dctrl
-kMaintainer - | tbl-dctrl -cPackage -cMaintainer</p>
