<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
mcrypt, mdecrypt - encrypt or decrypt files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
mcrypt [ -dLFubhvrzp ] [-a algorithm] [-c config_file] [-m
mode] [-s keysize] [-o keymode] [-k key1 key2 ...] [-f
keyfile] [ filename ... ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mdecrypt [ -LFusbhvzp ] [-a
algorithm] [-c config_file] [-m mode] [-s keysize] [-o
keymode] [-k key1 key2 ...] [-f keyfile] [ filename ...
]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Mcrypt is a simple crypting program, a replacement for the
old unix crypt(1). When encrypting or decrypting a file, a
new file is created with the extension .nc and mode 0600.
<br>
The new file keeps the modification date of the original.
The original file may be deleted by specifying the -u
parameter. If no files are specified, the standard input is
<br>
encrypted to the standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mcrypt uses all the symmetric
algorithms included in libmcrypt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HINTS <br>
By default, mcrypt , when one of these algorithms is
specified, prompts something like: <br>
Enter passphrase: ... <br>
You should then enter a passphrase long enough (512
characters is the maximum length). Now in order to encrypt
the file, The passphrase is transformed using the specified
(or <br>
the default) key generation algorithm, and a random salt.
The produced value is then used as the key, which is fed to
the algorithm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Algorithm Vulnerability: Most
algorithms today are designed to resist in specific attacks.
None of them is proved not to be vulnerable to some kind of
attack not as yet known.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Compression: By compressing your
data before encryption you gain both in efficiency (faster
encryption) and safety of your data (language redundancy is
removed). A drawback is <br>
that most compression programs will add specific headers in
the compressed file, thus making known plaintext attacks
easier. Compression after encryption is useless and may <br>
result to compressed files with longer size than the
original.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Error Recovery: There is some
error recovery in mcrypt. If bytes are removed or lost from
the file or stream in ECB, CBC and OFB modes, are impossible
to recover, although CFB <br>
mode will recover. If some bytes are altered then a full
block of plaintext is affected in ECB mode, two blocks in
CBC and CFB modes, but only the corresponding byte in OFB
mode. <br>
Mcrypt uses a 32 bit CRC to check for errors in the
encrypted files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Extra security: For the very
paranoid, if mcrypt is executed with superuser privileges it
ensures that no important data (keys etc.) are written to
disk, as swap etc. Keep in <br>
mind that mcrypt was not designed to be a setuid program, so
you shouldn&rsquo;t make it one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Do not rely on the fact that an
algorithm has a large key size, try to use long passphrases
and try to make them unpredictable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All the block algorithms above
support these modes of encryption:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ECB: The Electronic CodeBook
mode. It is the simplest mode to use with a block cipher.
Encrypts each block independently.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CBC: The Cipher Block Chaining
mode. It is better than ECB since the plaintext is
XOR&rsquo;ed with the previous ciphertext. A random block is
placed as the first block so the same <br>
block or messages always encrypt to something different.
(This is the default mode)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CFB: The Cipher-Feedback Mode
(in 8bit). This is a self-synchronizing stream cipher
implemented from a block cipher.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OFB: The Output-Feedback Mode
(in 8bit). This is a synchronous stream cipher implemented
from a block cipher. It is intended for use in noisy lines,
because corrupted ciphertext <br>
blocks do not corrupt the plaintext blocks that follow.
Insecure when used to encrypt large amounts of data, so I
recommend against using it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nOFB: The Output-Feedback Mode
(in nbit). n Is the size of the block of the algorithm. This
is a synchronous stream cipher implemented from a block
cipher. It is intended for use <br>
in noisy lines, because corrupted ciphertext blocks do not
corrupt the plaintext blocks that follow.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Encrypted files can be restored
to their original form using mcrypt -d or mdecrypt</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mdecrypt takes a list of files
on its command line and creates a new file for each file
whose name ends with .nc by removing the &quot;.nc&quot; or
by adding &quot;.dc&quot; to the end of the file <br>
name if .nc is not in the encrypted file&rsquo;s name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-F --force <br>
Force output on standard output or input from stdin if that
is a terminal. By default mcrypt will not output encrypted
data to terminal, nor read encrypted data from it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z --gzip <br>
Use gzip (if it exists in your system) to compress files
before encryption. If specified at decryption time it will
decompress these files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p --bzip2 <br>
Use bzip2 (if it exists in your system) to compress files
before encryption. If specified at decryption time it will
decompress these files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--openpgp-z INT <br>
This option will enable compression in OpenPGP (RFC2440)
encrypted files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d --decrypt <br>
Decrypt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help <br>
Display a help screen and quit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v --version <br>
Version. Display the version number and quit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L --license <br>
Display the mcrypt&rsquo;s license and quit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o --keymode MODE <br>
MODE may be one of the keymodes listed by the
--list-keymodes parameter. It actually is the conversion to
the key before it is fed to the algorithm. It is recommended
to <br>
leave it as is, if you do not know what it is. However if
you still want to use this option, you might want to use the
&rsquo;hex&rsquo; mode which allows you to specify the key
in <br>
hex (and no conversion will be applied).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h --hash HASH_ALGORITHM <br>
HASH_ALGORITHM may be one of the algorithms listed by the
--list-hash parameter. This is the digest that will be
appended to the file to be encrypted, in order to detect
<br>
file corruption. The default is the CRC32 checksum.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s --keysize SIZE <br>
SIZE is the algorithm&rsquo;s key size in bytes (not the
size of the passphrase). It defaults to the maximum key
supported by the algorithm. The maximum key sizes of the
algo&acirc; <br>
rithms may be obtained by the --list parameter. It is safe
not to touch this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g --openpgp <br>
This option will make mcrypt to use the OpenPGP (RFC2440)
file format for encrypted files. This will make files
encrypted by mcrypt accessible from any OpenPGP compliant
<br>
application.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b --bare <br>
No important information like the algorithm, mode, the bit
mode and the crc32 of the original file are written in the
encrypted file. The security lies on the algorithm <br>
not on obscurity so this is NOT the default. This flag must
also be specified when decrypting a bare encrypted file.
When the bare flag is specified decryption and <br>
encryption are faster. This may be useful when using mcrypt
to encrypt a link or something like that.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--flush <br>
Flushes the output (ciphertext or plaintext) immediately.
Useful if mcrypt is used with pipes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--time Prints some timing
information (encryption speed etc.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--nodelete <br>
When this option is specified mcrypt does not delete the
output file, even if decryption failed. This is useful if
you want to decrypt a corrupted file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q --quiet <br>
Suppress some not critical warnings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u --unlink <br>
Unlink (delete) the input file if the whole process of
encryption/decryption succeeds. This is not the default in
order to use an external program to remove sensitive <br>
data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--list <br>
Lists all the algorithms current supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--list-keymodes <br>
Lists all the key modes current supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--list-hash <br>
Lists all the hash algorithms current supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r --random <br>
Use /dev/(s)random instead of /dev/urandom. This may need
some key input or mouse move to proceed. If your system does
not support /dev/random or /dev/urandom, a random <br>
gatherer will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k --key KEY1 KEY2 ... <br>
Enter the keyword(s) via the command line. The KEY(s) is/are
then used as keyword instead of prompting for them. Keep in
mind that someone may see the command you are exe&acirc;
<br>
cuting and so your keyword(s).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c --config FILE <br>
Use the specified configuration file. The default is
.mcryptrc in your home directory. The format of the
configuration file is the same as the parameters. An example
file <br>
is: <br>
algorithm safer+ <br>
mode cbc <br>
key a_very_secret_one</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f --keyfile FILE <br>
Enter the keyword(s) via a file. One keyword is read per
line. The first keyword read is used for the first file, the
second for the second file etc. If the keywords are <br>
less than the files then the last keyword is used for the
remaining. A limitation is that you cannot use the NULL ( )
and the Newline (0 character in the key. A solu&acirc; <br>
tion to this problem is to specify the keyword in hex
mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m --mode MODE <br>
Mode of encryption and decryption. These modes are currently
supported: ECB, CFB, OFB, nOFB, CBC and STREAM. CBC is the
default. Unless the bare flag is specified there is <br>
no need to specify these modes for decryption. For stream
algorithms (like WAKE) mode should be STREAM.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a --algorithm ALGORITHM <br>
The algorithm used to encrypt and decrypt. Unless the bare
flag is specified there is no need to specify these for
decryption.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The algorithms currently
supported are shown with the --list parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
For mcrypt to be compatible with the solaris des(1), the
following parameters are needed: &quot;mcrypt -a des
--keymode pkdes --bare --noiv filename&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For mcrypt to be compatible with
the unix crypt(1), the following parameters are needed:
&quot;mcrypt -a enigma --keymode scrypt --bare
filename&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To encrypt a file using a stream
algorithm (eg. Arcfour), the following parameters are
needed: &quot;mcrypt -a arcfour --mode stream
filename&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
Mcrypt uses the following environment variables:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MCRYPT_KEY: to specify the
key</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MCRYPT_ALGO: to specify the
algorithm</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MCRYPT_MODE: to specify the
algorithm&rsquo;s mode</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MCRYPT_KEY_MODE: to specify the
key mode</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can use these instead of
using the command line (which is insecure), but note that
only one key should be used in MCRYPT_KEY.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
crypt(1), des(1) mcrypt(3)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
Exit status is normally 0; if an error occurs, exit status
is something other than 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Usage: mcrypt [-dLFubhvrzp] [-f
keyfile] [-k key1 key2 ...] [-m mode] [-o keymode] [-a
