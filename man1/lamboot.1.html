<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
LAM_MPI_SESSION_PREFIX</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LAM_MPI_SESSION_SUFFIX <br>
It is possible to change the session directory used by
LAM/MPI, normally of the form:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">tmpdir/lam-username@hostname[-suffix]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tmpdir will be set to
LAM_MPI_SESSION_PREFIX if set. Otherwise, it will fall back
to the value of TMPDIR. If neither of these are set, the
default is /tmp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">suffix can be overridden by the
LAM_MPI_SESSION_SUFFIX environment variable. If
LAM_MPI_SESSION_SUFFIX is not set and LAM is running under a
supported batch scheduling sys&acirc; <br>
tem, $suffix will be a value unique to the currently running
job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The lamboot tool starts the LAM software on each of the
machines specified in the boot schema, bhost. The boot
schema specifies the hostnames of nodes to be used in the
run-time <br>
MPI environment, and optionally lists how may CPUs LAM may
used on each node. The user may wish to first run the
recon(1) tool to verify that LAM can be started.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Starting LAM is a three step
procedure. In the first step, hboot(1) is invoked on each of
the specified machines. Then each machine allocates a
dynamic port and communicates it <br>
back to lamboot which collects them. In the third step,
lamboot gives each machine the list of machines/ports in
order to form a fully connected topology. If any machine was
<br>
not able to start, or if a timeout period expires before the
first step completes, lamboot invokes lamwipe(1) to
terminate LAM and reports the error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The bhost file is a LAM boot
schema written in the host file syntax. See bhost(5).
Instead of the command line, a boot schema can be specified
in the LAMBHOST environment vari&acirc; <br>
able. Otherwise a default file, lam-bhost.def, is used. LAM
searches for bhost first in the local directory and then in
the installation directory under etc/.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition, lamboot uses a
process schema for the individual LAM nodes. A process
schema (see conf(5)) is a description of the processes which
constitute the operating system <br>
on a node. In general, the system administrator maintains
this file -- LAM/MPI users will generally not need to change
this file. It is also possible for the user to customize
<br>
the LAM software with a private process schema.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The bhost file <br>
The format of the bhost file is documented in the bhost(5)
man page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lamboot will resolve all names
in bhost on the node in which lamboot was invoked (the
origin node). After that, LAM will only use IP addresses,
not names. Specifically, the <br>
name resolution configuration on all other nodes is not
used. Hence, the the origin node must be able to resolve all
the names in bhost to addresses that are reachable by all
<br>
other nodes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A common mistake is to list
localhost (or any name that resolves to the special address
127.0.0.1 -- the loopback TCP/IP device) in a bhost file
that contains other nodes. In <br>
this case, the address 127.0.0.1 would be sent to each of
the other nodes as the address of the origin node. If the
other nodes try to use 127.0.0.1 to contact the origin node,
<br>
they will actually be contacting themselves, and would
eventually timeout and fail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The IP addresses obtained from
bhost are used for LAM&rsquo;s meta messages: startup and
shutdown of jobs, out-of-band messages used for
coordination, etc. The amount of traffic is <br>
fairly low (unless using the &quot;lamd&quot; mode of MPI
message passing, in which case all MPI traffic will also
utilize LAM&rsquo;s meta messages for transport -- see
mpirun(1)). When using <br>
the TCP RPI, these IP addresses are also used for MPI
message passing via direct sockets between each pair of
nodes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A common case is where a
&quot;master&quot; node has multiple network interface cards
(NICs) -- one that is connected to a public network, and one
that is connected to a private network <br>
where parallel jobs are to be run. To include the master
node in a bhost file, the IP name (or address) of the NIC on
the private network should be listed in bhost. This
en&acirc; <br>
sures that all the other nodes can reach the master node on
the private network.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As another example, some
configurations have multiple TCP/IP NICs in each node of a
parallel job. One NIC is considered &quot;slow&quot; (e.g.,
10Mbps), while the other is considered <br>
&quot;fast&quot; (e.g., 100Mbps). It is desirable to allow
LAM to take advantage of the higher bandwidth on the
&quot;fast&quot; network for MPI messages. As such, bhost
should list the IP names <br>
(or addresses) of all the &quot;fast&quot; NICs. However, if
the LAM RPI does not use TCP/IP (e.g., the Myrinet/GM RPI),
the bhost file should probably list the &quot;slow&quot;
NICs so that LAM&rsquo;s <br>
meta message traffic does not cause overhead and potentially
detract from performance on the &quot;fast&quot; network
from other high-performance applications.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Delaying hostname lookups <br>
Normally, name resolution of hostnames is done on the
machines where lamboot is invoked. This is done for
optimization reasons, so that the list of hostnames only
needs to be <br>
resolved once (potentially minimizing the amount of DNS or
other hostname-lookup network traffic).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, in some non-uniform
networking environments, this is not sufficient because each
host may have a different IP address on each of its peers.
For example, host A may have <br>
address Z on host B, but have address Y on host C.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -l option to lamboot will
cause LAM to distribute hostnames to each node rather than a
fully resolved set of IP addresses. Hence, each node where
LAM is booted will do its <br>
own name resolution on the list of hostnames.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SSI (System Services Interface)
<br>
The -ssi switch allows the passing of parameters to various
SSI modules. LAM&rsquo;s SSI modules are described in detail
in lamssi(7). SSI modules have direct impact on MPI programs
<br>
because they allow tunable parameters to be set at run time
(such as which boot device driver to use, what parameters to
pass to that driver, etc.).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -ssi switch takes two
arguments: key and value. The key argument generally
specifies which SSI module will receive the value. For
example, the key &quot;boot&quot; is used to select <br>
which RPI to be used for starting processes on remote nodes.
The value argument is the value that is passed. For
example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lamboot -ssi boot tm <br>
Tells LAM to use the &quot;tm&quot; boot module for native
launching in PBSPro / OpenPBS environments (the tm boot
module does not require a boot schema).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lamboot -ssi boot rsh -ssi
rsh_agent &quot;ssh -x&quot; boot_schema <br>
Tells LAM to use the &quot;rsh&quot; boot module, and tells
the rsh module to use &quot;ssh -x&quot; as the specific
agent to launch executables on remote nodes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">And so on. LAM&rsquo;s boot SSI
modules are described in lamssi_boot(7). This page should be
consulted for specific actions that are taken by, and how to
tweak the run-time behavior <br>
of each boot module.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -ssi switch can be used
multiple times to specify different key and/or value
arguments. If the same key is specified more than once, the
values are concatenated with a comma <br>
(&quot;,&quot;) separating them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the -ssi switch is
simply a shortcut for setting environment variables. The
same effect may be accomplished by setting corresponding
environment variables before run&acirc; <br>
ning lamboot. The form of the environment variables that LAM
sets are: LAM_MPI_SSI_key=value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the -ssi switch
overrides any previously set environment variables. Also
note that unknown key arguments are still set as environment
variable -- they are not checked <br>
(by lamwipe) for correctness. Illegal or incorrect value
arguments may or may not be reported -- it depends on the
specific SSI module.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Remote Executable Invocation
<br>
All tweakable aspects of launching executables on remote
nodes during lamboot are discussed in lamssi(7) and
lamssi_boot(7). Topics include (but are not limited to):
discovery <br>
of remote shell, run-time overrides of the agent use to
launch remote executables (e.g., rsh and ssh), etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Closing stdio <br>
The stdio of each LAM daemon on a remote host that is
launched by lamboot is closed by default. Normally, the
stdio of the LAM daemon launched on the local host is left
open so <br>
that the internal LAM tstdio(3) package works properly.
However, it is sometimes desirable to close the stdio of the
local LAM daemon as well. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rsh somenode lamboot -s
hostfile</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is because rsh waits for
two conditions before exiting: lamboot to exit, and stdout /
stderr to be closed. Without -s, stdout / stderr would not
be closed, and rsh (and <br>
ssh) will hang even though lamboot had completed. -s causes
the stdout / stderr of the local LAM daemon to be closed
upon invocation, which will allow rsh to complete. Using -s
<br>
will not affect lamboot in any other way, but it will
prevent the tstdio(3) package from working properly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fault Tolerance <br>
If the -x option is given, LAM runs in fault tolerant mode.
In this mode, nodes exchange &lsquo;&lsquo;heart
beat&rsquo;&rsquo; messages periodically to make sure all
nodes are running and the links <br>
connecting them are operational. When a node&rsquo;s heart
beats stop, it is declared &lsquo;&lsquo;dead&rsquo;&rsquo;
and all LAM nodes (and processes) are notified. This allows
users to write fault toler&acirc; <br>
ant applications that can degrade gracefully, or fully
recover by replacing the defunct node with another (see
lamgrow(1)). Since this mode introduces a performance
penalty, it <br>
is not activated by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>

schema. Report about important steps as they are done.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lamboot -d hostfile <br>

Provide incredibly detailed reports on what is happening at
each stage in the boot process.</p>
