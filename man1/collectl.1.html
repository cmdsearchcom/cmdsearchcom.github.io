collectl - Collects data that describes the current system status.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
Record Mode - read data from live system and write to file or display on
  terminal
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>collectl [-f file] [options]</b>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Playback Mode - read data from one or more raw data files and display on
  terminal
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>collectl -p file1 [file2 ...] [options]</b>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
Record Mode
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
In this mode data is taken from a <b>live</b> system and either displayed on the
  terminal or written to one or more files or a socket.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>--align</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">If the HiRes modules is present,
  <b>collectl</b> sample monitoring will be aligned such that a sample will
  always be taken at the top of a minute (this does NOT mean the first sample
  will occur then) so that all instances of collectl running on any systems
  which have their clocks synchronized will all take samples at the same time.
  Furthermore, if one is doing process monitoring, those samples will also be
  taken at the top of the minute and so can delay the start of sampling up to 2
  full process monitoring intervals.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>--all</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Collect summary data for ALL subsystems except
  slabs, since slab monitoring requires a different monitoring interval. This
  also means you won't get any detail data which also includes processes and
  environmementals. You can use this switch anywhere -s can be used but not both
  together. If the system supports lustre and/or interconnect monitoring those
  statistics will be provided but the warnings produced when they are not
  available you try to select them with -s will not be displayed.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>--ALL</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">This is actually a superset of --all by adding
  detail statistics as well with the exception of TCP details when displaying to
  a terminal since those are only available with -P or -f.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>-A, --address address[:port[:timeout]] | server[:port]</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">In the first form, one specifies an address,
  optional port and timeout (the first colon is required to specify timeout for
  default port). All data is then written to that socket prefaced with the
  current host name at the named address and port until the socket is closed, at
  which time collectl will exit.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
In the second form one enters the text &quot;server&quot; and optional port. In
  this form, collectl runs as a server, waiting for a connection and once
  established writes data on that socket. The key difference here is if the
  client exists collectl keeps running and will again look for a new connection,
  allowing it to survive client restarts or crashes.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The default port is set at 2655 but can be changed - see collectl.conf.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
In both forms, one can additionally request local data logging by specifying a
  combination of -P and -f. See <b>man collectl-logging</b> for more
  details.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>--comment string</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Add the specified string to the end of the
  headers in the data files. If any embedded spaces be sure to quote it. This
  can be very useful when doing characterizations or benchmarking and you're
  frequently changing system/application parameters and restarting collectl
  between tests.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>-C, --config filename</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Name/location of the collectl configuration
  file. If not specified, <b>collectl</b> searches for <b>collectl.conf</b>
  first in /etc (the default), then in the same directory the <b>collectl</b>
  executable is in, and finally the current working directory.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>-c, --count Samples</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">The number of samples to record. This is one
  way of 3 ways of describing how long collectl should run (see <b>-r</b> and
  <b>-R</b> ). Note that these 3 switches are mutually exclusive.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>-D, --daemon</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Run <b>collectl</b> as a daemon, primarily
  used when starting as a service. One caveat about this mode is you can only
  run one copy.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>--export file[,options]</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">This requests that collectl does not print
  anything on the terminal (or send it to a socket) using the standard
  brief/verbose/plot formats. Instead it executes a perl &quot;require&quot; on
  the named file, using an extension of ph if not specified. It first looks in
  the current directory and if not there the directory the executable is in. It
  then calls the function &quot;file&quot;Init(options) towards the beginning of
  collectl and again as simply &quot;file&quot;(@options) to generate the
  exported formatted output. See the online documentation on Exporting Custom
  Output and Logging for more details.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>-f, --filename Filename</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">This is the name of a file to write the output
  to. For details on how the output files are named, see the <b>File</b>
  <b>Naming</b> section of the documentation on collectl.sourceforge.net OR
  /usr/share/doc/collectl/FileNaming.html
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>-F, --flush seconds</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Flush output buffers after this number of
  seconds. This is equivalent to issuing <b>kill -s USR1</b> at the same
  frequency (but a lot easier!). If 0, a flush will occur every data collection
  interval.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>--grep pattern</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">The main purpose of this switch is for those
  users who have discovered there is some data in the raw files that never
  appears in any display and have taken to displaying it themselves with grep.
  Unfortunately this method does not include timestamps and so makes it
  difficult to interpret the results. Even if you include the timestamp from the
  file it is in UTC and so needs to be translated to be of any real value. This
  switch does just that and then some.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Specifically, it allows you to playback a file and instead of processing it
  normally it simply searches for any entries that match the perl pattern and
  reports those lines prefaced with time stamps. You can optionally change the
  time format with the usual -o options and can even select the timeframe with
  --from and --thru.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>--home</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Always start the display for the current
  interval at the top of the screen also known as the home position (non-plot
  format only). This generates a real-time, continously refreshing display when
  the data fits on a single screen.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>--import file1[,options][:file2[,options]...]</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">This loads the named files and executes
  callbacks to them, which is the API mechanism for importing additional metrics
  into collectl. See the webpage on the API for further detail.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Since these files also include instructions for how to report the output in all
  the various forms, you will also need to include --import during playback.
  Finally, since the default is to seamlessly include imported data with
  everything else collectl reports, if you ONLY want to display imported data
  you much explicitly deselect all other subsystems either by including -s-
  (note the trailing minus sign) followed by all the subsystems were recorded OR
  simply say -s-all.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>-i, --interval interval[:interval2[:interval3]]</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">This is the sampling interval in seconds. The
  default is 10 seconds when run as a daemon and 1 second otherwise. The process
  subsystem and slabs (-sY and -sZ) are sampled at the lower rate of
  <b>interval2.</b> Environmentals (-sE), which only apply to a subset of
  hardware, are sampled at <b>interval3.</b> Both <b>interval2</b> and
  <b>interval3,</b> if specified, must be an even multiple of <b>interval1.</b>
  The daemon default is -i10:60:300 and all other modes are -i1:60:300. To
  sample only processes once every 10 seconds use -i:10.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>--nohup</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Whenever collectl finishes a data collection
  interval, it checks to see if the starting parent has exited. This is to
  prevent the case in which someone might start a copy of collectl and then the
  process dies and collectl keeps running. If that is the behavior someone
  actually intends, they should start collectl with --nohup.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
NOTE - when running as a daemon, --nohup is implied.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>--quiet</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Whenever collectl wants to tell the user
  something, it assigns a category to it such as Informational, Warning, Error
  or Fatal. When run with -m, all messages are displayed for the user and if
  logging data to a file with -f, these messages are also sent to a log file
  which is in the data collection directory and has an extenion of
  &quot;log&quot;. However, if -m is not specified Informational messages (such
  as collectl starting or stopping) are not reported on the terminal but the
  other 3 are. Sometimes the warnings can be annoying and one can suppress these
  with --quiet though they will still be written to the message log in -f. You
  cannot suppress Error or Fatal errors.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>-r, --rolllogs time[[,days[:months]][,minutes]]</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">When selected, collectl runs indefinately (or
  at least until the system reboots). The maximum number of raw and/or plot
  files that will be retained (older ones are automatically deleted) is
  controlled by the <b>days</b> field, the default is 7. When -m is also
  specified to direct collectl to write messages to a log file in the logging
  directory, the number of months to retain those logs is controlled by the
  <b>months</b> field and its default is 12. The <b>increment</b> field which is
  also optional (but is position dependent) specifies the duration of an
  individual collection file in minutes the default of which is 1440 or 1
  day.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>--rawdskfilt</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">This switch overrides the DiskFilter setting
  in collectl.conf and explicitly defines a perl regx expression against which
  records from /prod/diskstats are selected for processing. When there are a lot
  of disks to process, this can be a handy way to reduce the amount of data
  collected and actually improve performance since there are less patterns to
  match each input record against. Just remember that unlike --dskfilt which
  only filters during display, records filtered with this switch are never even
  recorded and so lost forever.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
You can optionally specify your filter with a leading plus-sign which tells
  collectl to just add your filter to the default specification. Care should be
  taken here as longer filters will slightly increase overhead and with a lot of
  disks and/or shorter monitoring intervals can add up.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
As a side benefit of this switch, if you really want to look at partition level
  stats you can do so by leaving off the trailing space in the default pattern.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
One must be also be careful in selecting the correct pattern since it's easy to
  get it wrong and you may end up collecting the WRONG data! To verify you are
  collecting what you think you are, make a test run using -d4 to see the raw
  data being recorded in real-time.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>--rawdskignore</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">This is the opposite of the rawdskfilt switch.
  When specified any disks listed are completely ignored and will not appear in
  the raw file. Typically this switch is useful when you're only interested in
  recording a subset of disk statistics.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>--rawnetfilt</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">This works just like --rawdskfilt except it
  applies to networks. Unlike disk filtering which has an explicit default
  pattern, the default for network filtering is to simply record all network
  data from /proc/net/dev.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The -d4 switch also works here, as well as everywhere, to see the raw data as it
  is being collected.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>--rawnetignore</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">This is the opposite of the rawnetfilt switch
  and works just like the rawdskignore switch. When specified any networks
  listed are ignored and will not appear in the raw file. Typically this switch
  is useful when you're only interested in recording a subset of network
  statistics.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>--rawtoo</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Only available in conjunction with -P, this
  switch causes the creation/logging of raw data in addition to plottable data.
  While this may seem excessive, keep in mind that unlike plottable data, raw
  data can be played back with different switches potentially providing more
  details. The overhead to write out this additional data is minimal, the only
  real cost being that of extra disk space.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>-R, --runas uid[:gid]</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">This switch only works when running in daemon
  mode and so must be specified in the DaemonCommands line. Its presence will
  cause collectl to write the collectl.pid file into the same directory as its
  other output files as specified by -f, since /var/run does not normally grant
  non-privileged users write access. Furthermore, the ownership of that
  directory must match the specified ownership since collectl needs to write ALL
  it's files to that directory and can no longer assume global permissions when
  run as root.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This WILL also require manually modifying /etc/init.d/collectl to change the
  PIDFILE variable to point to the same directory which the -f switch in the
  DaemonCommands line of collectl.conf points to.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
As a final note of caution, since this mechanism changes where collectl
  reads/writes its pid file, once you start using --runas, all calls to run
  collectl as a daemon must use it or it may be confused and exhibit
  unpredictable behavior.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>-R, --runtime duration</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Specify the duration of data collection where
  the duration is a number followed by one of <b>wdhms,</b> indicating how many
  weeks, days, hours, minutes or seconds the collection is to be taken
  for.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>--sep separator</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Specify the plot format separator - default is
  a space. If this is a numeric field it is interpretted as the decimal value of
  the associated ASCII character code. Otherwise it is interpretted as the
  character itself. In other words, &quot;--sep :&quot; sets the separator
  character to a colon and &quot;--sep 9&quot; sets it to a horizontal tab.
  &quot;--sep 58&quot; would also set it to a colon.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>--tworaw</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">The switches -G and --group have been replaced
  by --rawtoo, which is more rescriptive of its function. When specified, it
  tells collectl to treat process and slab data as an entirely separate group of
  raw files, named with the extention &quot;rawp&quot;. These separate files can
  be played back and processed just like any other collectl raw files and in
  fact one can even play back both at the same time if that is what is desired.
  The only real purpose of this switch is that on some systems with many
  processes, it is possible to generate huge raw files (some have been observerd
  to be &gt;250MB!) and while collectl will happily play back/process these
  files it can take a long time. By using the --tworaw switch one still gets a
  huge rawp file, but the normal raw file is a much more manageable size and as
  a result will faster to process then when all data is combined into the same
  file.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Playback Mode
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
In this mode, data is read from one or more data files that were generated in
  Record Mode
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>--export Filename</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">When playing back a file, use this switch to
  create an identical raw file differing only in the timeframe being convered,
  so naturally one must also include --from, --thru or both. Further, since the
  resultant file will contain the exact same raw data you cannot select a subset
  using -s. This switch is actually intended for a support function for
  situations where somone is having problems playing back a file and a subset of
  the original raw file that covers the problem time has been requested,
  hopefully allowing a significantly file to be posted or emailed.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>--extract filename</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">If specified, rather than actually play back
  the file specified with -p, ALL raw data between the date ranges is selected
  and a subset of that raw file created. The rules for how to interpret the
  filename are the same as used for -f.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>-f, --filename filename</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">If specified, this is the name of a file or
  directory to write the output to (rather than the terminal). See the
  description for details on the format of this field. This requires the -P flag
  as well.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>--from time range</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Play back data starting with this time, which
  may optionally include the ending time as well, which is of the format of
  [date:]time[-[date:]time]. The leading 0 of the hour is optional and if the
  seconds field is not specified is assumed to be 0. If no dates specified the
  time(s) apply to each file specified by -P. Otherwise the time(s) only apply
  to the first/last dates and any files between those dates will have all their
  data reported.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>--full</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Full mode is actually a superset of --verbose
  and if selected will force --verbose. It will also force the RECORD separator
  to be printed for every interval even if only a single subsystem was requested
  and to include the actual subsystems that follow following the utc timestamp
  as a parsing aid for those who may wish to parse the text output rather than
  the plot data.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>--offsettime seconds</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">This field originally was used before collectl
  reported the timezone in the file headers and allowed one to compensate. Since
  then it is rarely needed except in two possible cases, one in which data on
  two systems is to be compared and they weren't synchonized with ntp. This
  allows all the times to be reported as shifted by some number of seconds. The
  other case (and this is very rare) is when a clock had changed in the middle
  of a sample and will not be converted correctly. When this happens one may
  have to play back the samples in pieces and manually set the time
  offset.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>--passwd filename</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">When reporting usernames associated with a
  UID, use this file for the mapping. This is particularly important on systems
  running NIS where this are no user names in /etc/passwd.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>-p, --playback Filename</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Read data from the specified <b>playback</b>
  file(s), noting that one can use wildcards in the filename if quoted (if
  playing back multiple files to the terminal you probably want to include -m to
  see the filenames as they are processed). The filename must either end in
  <b>raw</b> or <b>raw.gz.</b> As an added feature, since people sometimes
  automate the running of this option and don't want to hard code a date, you
  can specify the string YESTERDAY or TODAY and they will be replaced in the
  filename string by the appropriate date.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>--pname name</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">By default, collectl uses the file
  /var/run/collectl.pid to indicate the pid of the running instance of collectl
  and prevent multiple copies from being run. If you DO want to run a second
  copy, this switch will cause collectl to change its process name to
  collectl-name and use that name as the associated pid file as well.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>--procanalyze</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">When specified and there is process data in
  the raw file, a summary file will be generated with one entry unique process
  containing such things as the total cpu consumed for both user and system,
  min/max utilization of various memory types, total page faults and several
  others.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>--slabanalyze</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">When specified and there is slab data in the
  raw file, a summary file will be generated with one entry unique slab
  containing data on physical memory usage by that slab.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>--thru time</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Time thru which to play back a raw file. See
  --from for more</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Common Switches - both record and playback modes
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>-d, --debug debug</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Control the level of debugging information,
  not typically used. For details see the source code.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>-h, --help, -x, --helpext, -X, --helpall</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Display standard, extended help message (which
  doesn't include the optional displays such as --showoptions, --showsubsys,
  --showsubopts, --showtopopts) or everything.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>--hr, --headerrepeat num</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Sets the number of intervals to display data
  for before repeating the header. A value -1 will prevent any headers from
  being displayed and a value of 0 will cause only a single header to be
  displayed and never repeated.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>--iosize</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">In brief mode, include iosize with disk,
  infiniband and network data.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>-l, --limits limit</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Override one or more default exception limits.
  If more than one limit they must be separated by hyphens. Current values are:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>SVC:value</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Report partition activity with Service times
  &gt;= 30 msec</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>IOS:value</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Report device activity with 10 or more reads
  or writes per second</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>LusKBS:value</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Report client or OSS activity greater than
  limit. Only applies to Client Summary or OSS Detail reporting.
  [default=100000]</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>LusReints:value</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Report MDS activity with Reint greater than
  limit. Only applies to MDS Summary reporting. [default=1000]</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>AND</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Both the IOS and SCV limits must be reached
  before a device is reported. This is the default value and is only included
  for completeness.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>OR</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Report device activity if either IOS or SVC
  thresholds are reached.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>-L, --lustsvcs [c|m|o][:seconds]</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">This switch limits which servics lustre checks
  for and the frequency of those checks. For more information see the man page
  collectl-lustre.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
</div>
<b>-m, --messages</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Write status to a monthly log file in the same
  directory as the output file (requires -f to be specified as well). The name
  of the file will be <b>collectl-yyyymm.log</b> and will track various messages
  that may get generated during every run of <b>collectl.</b></div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>-N, --nice</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Set priority to a <b>nicer</b> one of 10.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
</div>
<b>-o, --options Options</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">These apply to the way output is displayed OR
  written to a plot file. They do not effect the way data is selected for
  recording. Most of these switches work in both record as well as playback
  mode. If you're not sure, just try it.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>1</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Data in plotting format should use 1 decimal
  point of precision as appropriate.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>2</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Data in plotting format should use 2 decimal
  points of precision as appropriate.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>a</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Always append data to an existing plot file.
  By default if a plot file exists, the playback file will be skipped as a way
  of assuring it is associated with a single recorded file. This switch
  overrides that mechanism allowing muliple recorded files to be processed and
  written to a single plot file.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>c</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Always open newly named plot fies in
  <b>create</b> mode, overwriting any old ones that may already exists. If one
  processes multiple files for the same day in <b>append</b> mode multiple
  times, the same data will be appended to the same file mulitple times. This
  assures a new file is created at the start of the processing.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>d</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">For use with terminal output and brief mode.
  Preceed each line with a date/time stamp, the date being in mm/dd format. This
  option can also be applied to plot formatit which will cause the date portion
  to also be displayed in this format as opposed to D format.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>D</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">For use with terminal output and brief mode.
  Preceed each line with a date/time stamp, the date being in yyyymmdd
  format.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>g</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">For use with terminal output and brief mode.
  When displaying values of 1G or greater there is limited precision for 1 digit
  values. This options provides a way to display additional digits for more
  granularity by substituting a &quot;g&quot; for the decimal point rather than
  the trailing &quot;G&quot;.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>G</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">For use with terminal output and brief mode.
  This is similar to &quot;g&quot; but preserves the trailing &quot;G&quot; by
  sacrificing a digit of granularity.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>m</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Whenever times are reported in plot format, in
  the normal terminal reporting format at the bginning of each interval or when
  when one of the time reporting options (d, D, T or U is selected), append the
  milliseconds to the time.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>n</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Where appropriate, data such as disk KBs or
  transfers are normalized to units per second by taking the change in a counter
  and dividing by the number of seconds in that interval. In the case of CPUs,
  utilization (calculated in jiffies) is normalized as a percentage of the
  interval.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Normalization can be disabled via this option, the result being the reported
  values are not divided by the duration of the interval. This can be
  particulary useful for reporting values that are &lt; 1/2 the sampling, which
  will be rounded to 0.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>T</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">For use with terminal output and brief mode,
  preceeds each line with a time stamp.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>u</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Create plot files with unique names by include
  the starting time of a colletion in the name. This forces multiple collections
  taken the same day to be written to multiple files.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>-U or --utc</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">In plot format only, report timestamps in
  Coordinated Universal time which is more commonly know as UTC.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>x</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Report only exception records for selected
  subsystems. Exception reporting also requires --verbose. Currently this only
  applies to disk detail and Lustre server information so one must select at
  least -s D, l or L for this to apply. If writing to a detail file, this data
  will go into a separate file with the extension <b>X</b> appended to the
  regular detail file name.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>X</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Report both exceptions as well as all details
  for selected subsystems, for -s D, l or L only.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>z</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">If the compression library has been installed,
  all output files will be compressed by default. This switch tells collectl not
  to compress any plottable files. If collectl tries to compress but cannot
  because the library hasn't been installed, it will generate a warning which
  can be suppressed with this switch.</div>
</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>-P, --plot</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Generate output in plot format. This format is
  space separated data which consists of a header (prefaced with a # for easy
  identification by an analysis program as well as identifying it as a comment
  for programs, such as gnuplot, which honor that convention). When written to
  disk, which is the typical way this option is used, <b>summary</b> data
  elements are written to the <b>tab</b> file and the <b>detail</b> elements
  written to one or more files, one per detail subsystem. If -f is not
  specified, all output is sent to the terminal. Output is always one line per
  sampling interval.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>--stats</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">This switch will cause brief data to be
  reported as both totals and averages after processing one or more files for
  the same day or in playback mode.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>--statopts option(s)</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">This switch controls the way brief stats are
  reported, the default is to report the totals once, at the end of a day's
  worth of raw files, if more than one.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
a - include averages along with totals
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
i - include the interval data itself, which is the equivalent of -oA
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
s - print summary stats at the end of each file processed even if more than one
  per day</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>-s, --subsys subsystem</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">This field controls which subsystem data is to
  be collected or played back. The default for collecting data is
  &quot;cdn&quot;, which stands for CPU, Disk and Network summary data and the
  default for playback is everthing that was collected.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The rules for displaying results vary depending on the type of data selected. If
  you write data for CPUs and DISKs to a raw file and play it back with -sc, you
  will only see CPU data. If you play it back with -scm you will still only see
  CPU data since memory data was not collected. However, when used with -P,
  collectl will always honor the subsystems specified with this switch so in the
  previous example you will see CPU data plus memory data of all 0s. To see the
  current set of default subsystems, which are a subset of this full list, use
  -h.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
You can also use + or - to add or subtract subsystems to/from the default
  values. For example, &quot;-s-cdn+N&quot;&lt; will remove cpu, disk and
  network monitoring from the defaults while adding network detail.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Refer to data definitions on the sourceforge website OR in
  /usr/share/collectl/doc/collectl-xxx to see complete descriptions of the data
  returned.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
SUMMARY SUBSYSTEMS

<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
DETAIL SUBSYSTEMS
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This is the set of <b>detail</b> data from which in most cases the corresponding
  summary data is derived. There are currently 2 types that do not have
  corresponding summary data and those are &quot;Environmental&quot; and
  &quot;Process&quot;. So, if one has 3 disks and chooses <b>-sd,</b> one will
  only see a single total taken across all 3 disks. If one chooses <b>-sD,</b>
  individual disk totals will be reported but no totals. Choosing <b>-sdD</b>
  will get you both.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
C - CPU
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
D - Disk
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
E - Environmental data (fan, power, temp), via ipmitool
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
F - NFS Data
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
J - Interrupts
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
L - Lustre OST detail OR client Filesystem detail
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
M - Memory node data, which is also known as numa data
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
N - Networks
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
T - 65 TCP counters only available in plot format
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
X - Interconnect
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
Y - Slabs (system object caches)
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
Z - Processes</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>--showheader</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">In collectl mode this command will cause the
  header that is normally written to a data file to be displayed on the terminal
  and collectl then exists. This can be a handy way to get a brief overview of
  the system configuration.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>--showoptions</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">This command shows only the portion of the
  help text that desribes the -o and --options switches to save the time of
  wading through the entire help screen.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>--showcolheaders</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">This command shows the first set of headers
  that will be printed by collectl and exits. Doesn't really make sense for
  multi-section output like several sets of verbose or detail data. Also note
  that since it requires one monitoring interval to build up some headers which
  may be dynamic, it also forces the interval to 0.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>--showsubopts</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">List all the subsystem specifice options</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>--showtopopts</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Show all the different values for the --top
  type field, which specify the field(s) by to sort the data</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>--showrootslabs</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">This command only works on systems using the
  new slab allocator and will list the root name (these are those entries in
  /sys/slab which are not soft links) along with all its alias names. If a name
  doesn't have an alias, it will not appear in this report.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>--showslabaliases</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">This command only works on systems using the
  new slab allocator. Like --showrootslabs, it will name a slab and all its
  aliases but rather than show the root slab name it will show one of the
  aliases to provide a more meaningful name. If there are any slabs that only
  have a single (or no) alias they will not be included in this report.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>--showsubopts</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Similar to --showoptions, this command
  summaries just the paramaters associated with -O and --subopts.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>--showsubsys</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Yet another way to summare a portion of the
  help text, this command only shows valid subsystems.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>--top [type][,num[,v]]</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Include the top &quot;num&quot; consumers by
  resource for this interval. The default number is the height of the window if
  it can be determined otherwise 24, and the default resource is the total cpu
  time which is taken as the sum of SysT and UsrT. See --showtopopts for a list
  of other types of data you can sort on.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This switch can also be used with -s in which case a portion of the window is
  reserved at the top to fill in the subsystem data, which is currently in
  verbose mode though a brief format is contemplated for some time in the
  future.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
In interactive mode and if not specified, the process monitoring interval will
  be set to that for other subsystems. The screen will be cleared for each
  interval resulting in a display similar to the &quot;top&quot; utility. In
  playback more the screen will NOT be cleared. You cannot use this switch in
  &quot;record&quot; mode.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Finally, if v is specified as the 3rd parameter, the output scrolls vertically
  (like playbak mode) rather than clearing the screen between intervals.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>--umask mask</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Sets collectl's umask to control output file
  permissions. Only root can set the umask. See &quot;man umask&quot; for
  details.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>--utime mask</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Write periodic micro-timestamps into raw file
  at different points in time for fine grained measurements of operation times.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
1 - write timestamps when entering major sections
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
2 - write timestamps for all /proc accesses except for process data
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
4 - write timestamps for /proc data for all processes including threads</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>-v</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Show version and whether or not Compression
  and/or HiResTime modules have been installed and exit.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>-V</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Show default parmeter and control settings,
  all of which can be changed in /etc/collectl.conf</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>--verbose</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Display output in verbose mode. This often
  displays more data than in the default mode. When displaying detail data,
  verbose mode is forced. Furthermore, if summary data for a single subsystem is
  to be displayed in verbose mode, the headers are only repeated occasionally
  whereas if multiple subsystems are involved each needs their own header.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>-w</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Disply data in <b>wide</b> mode. When
  displaying data on the terminal, some data is formatted followed by a K, M or
  G as appropriate. Selecting this switch will cause the full field to be
  displayed. Note that there is no attempt to align data with the column
  headings in this mode.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SUBSYSTEM_OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#SUBSYSTEM_OPTIONS">SUBSYSTEM
  OPTIONS</a></h1>
The following options are subsystem specific and typically filter data for
  collection and/or display as well as affect the output format:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>--cpufilt[^]perl-regx[,perl-regx...] </b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
Works the same as dskfilt and netfilt, allows one to select a subset of CPUs.
  These filters are also honored by interrupt reporting as well.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>--cpuopts</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
z - only applies to cpu details, do not report any CPUs with no load. In other
  words all entries are zero except for IDLE.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>--dskfilt [^]perl-regx[,perl-regx...]</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">NOTE - this does NOT effect data collection
  and ALL disk data will always be collected, unless --rawdskfilt is specified
  too. However, only data for disk names that match the pattern(s) will be
  included in the summary totals and displayed when details are requested.
  Alternatively, if you preface the first expression with a caret, all names
  that match all strings will be excluded from the summary totals and detail
  displays rather then included. If you don't know perl, a partial string will
  usually work too.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>--dskopts</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
f - report some columns as fractions for more precision on detail output
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
i - display the i/o sizes in brief mode just like with --iosize
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
o - exclude unused disks from new file headers and plot data
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
z - only applies to disk details, do not report any lines with values of all
  zeros.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>--dskremap aaa:bbb,ccc:ddd...</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">This will cause disk names matching the perl
  pattern aaa to be replaced with the string bbb. In some cases, you may simply
  want to remove the entire string in which case the second string should be
  left empty. If you want to remove a string container a /, be sure to escape it
  with a backslash.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>--envopts Environmental Options</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">The default is to display ALL data but the
  following will cause a subset to be displayed
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
f - display fan data
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
p - display current (power) data
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
t - display temperature data
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
C - convert temperature to Celcius if in Farenheit
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
F - convert temperature to Farenheit if in Celcius
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
M - display each type of data on separate line
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
T - display data truncated to whole integers (some implemenations displayed them
  with fractional components)
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
9 - any number, will tell ipmitool to read on this device number</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>--envfilt regx</b> If specified, this regx is evaluated against each line of
  data returned by ipmitool and only those that match are retained. All other
  data is lost.
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>--envremap perl-regx,...</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">If specified as a comma separated list of perl
  regular substitution expressions without the =~s portion, each expression is
  applied to each environmental field name, thereby allowing one to rename the
  column headers. This can be most useful when running on heterogeneuos systems
  and you want consistent column names.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>--intfilt [^]perl-regx[,perl-regx...]</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">NOTE - this does NOT effect data collection,
  ALL interrupt data will always be collected. However, only data for interrupts
  that match the pattern(s) will be included in the summary totals and displayed
  when details are requested. Alternatively, if you preface the first expression
  with a caret, all names that match all strings will be excluded from the
  summary totals and detail displays rather then included. If you don't know
  perl, a partial string will usually work too.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
NOTE - these expressions are applied to the entire line one sees in
  /proc/interrupts, including the interrupt number, name and even counters so if
  you do want to include an interrupt number in the pattern be sure to include
  the trailing colon as well.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>--lustopts Lustre Options</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
B - For clients and servers, show buffer stats
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
D - For MDSs and OSTs AND running earlier versions of HPSFS, collect disk block
  iostats
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
M - For clients, collect metadata
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
O - For OSTs, show detail level stats
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
R - For client, collect readahead stats</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>--memopts Memory Options</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">R - show memory values (including swap space)
  as rates of change as opposed to absolute values. One can also show absolute
  changes between intervals by including -on.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>--netfilt [^]perl-regx[,perl-regx...]</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">NOTE - this does NOT effect data collection
  and ALL network data will always be collected, unless --rawnetfilt is
  specified too. Also note that by default only eth, ib, em and p1p networks
  when present are included in the summary. When this switch is specified, only
  data for network names that match the pattern(s) will be included in the
  summary and displayed when details are requested. This switch therefore also
  gives you the ability to add other, possibly new, network devices to the
  summary totals.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Alternatively, if you preface the first expression with a caret, all names that
  match all strings will be excluded from the summary totals and detail displays
  rather then included. If you don't know perl, a partial string will usually
  work too.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>--netopts</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">e - include network error counts in brief and
  explicit error types elsewhere
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
E - only include lines with network errors in them
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
i - include i/o sizes in brief mode
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
o - exclude unused networks from new file headers and plot data
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
w - set width of network device name</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>--nfsfilt NFS Filters</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Specify one or more comma separated filters as
  a C/S followed by an nfs version number and only those will have data reported
  on. For example, C2 says to report data on V2 Clients. As a data collection
  performance optimization, if one or more client filters are specified, data
  will actually be collected for all clients as is also done for servers.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>--nfsopts NFS Options</b> q.RS z - only display detail lines which have data
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>--procfilt Process Filters</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">These filters restrict which processes are
  selected for collection/display. Using this filter will significanly reduce
  the load on process data collection since collectl creates a blacklist of
  those existing processes that do not pass the filter and so are permanently
  excluded from any future processing.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The format of a filter is a one charter type followed by a match string.
  Multiple filters may be specified if separated by commas.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
c - substring of the command being executed as explicitly read from
  /proc/pid/stat. Note that this can actually be a perl expression, so if you
  want a command that ends in a particular string all you need to is append a \$
  to the end of the string. Otherwise it would match any commands containing
  that string.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
C - any command that starts with the specified string
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
f - full path of the command, including arguments, as read from
  /proc/pid/cmdline. Like the c modifier this too can be a perl expression.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
p - pid
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
P - parent pid
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
u - any process ownerd by this user's UID or in the range specifide by uxxx-yyy
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
U - any process owned by this username
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>caution:</b> the process names collectl tries to match with c and C is the
  second field in /proc/pid/stat which may not necessarily be what you think! eg
  the name for X emacs is actually emacs-x</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>--procopts options</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">These options control the way data is
  displayed and can also improve data collection performance
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
c - include CPU time of children who have exited (same as ps -S)
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
f - use cumulative totals for page faults in process data instead of rates
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
i - show process I/O counters in display instead of default format
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
I - disable collection of I/O counters, see note below
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
k - remove known shells from process names, making it possible to see actual
  command
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
m - show breakdown of memory utilization instead of default format
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
p - never look for new pids or threads during data collection
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
r - show root command name only (no directory) for narrower display. Note that
  this is applied AFTER 'k' so if arg1 becomes the new command it will be
  truncated now, which is very handy when running in a virtual python
  environment
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
R - show ALL process priorities ('RT' currently displayed if realtime)
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
s - show process start time in hh:mm:ss format
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
S - show process start time in mmmdd-hh:mm:ss format
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
t - include ALL process threads (increases collection overhead)
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
u - report username as 12 chars instead of 8, noting uxx will cause column width
  to be xx but cannot be less than 8
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
w - widen display by including whole argument string, with optional max width
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
x - include extended process attributes (currently only for context switches)
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
z - exclude any processes with 0 in sort field (in --top mode)
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Process data is the most expensive type of data collected, costing as much as 3
  times the CPU load as all other types of data combined. Collecting thread data
  makes this even more expensive. One can significantly reduce this load by over
  25 percent by disabling the collection of I/O stats. However, keep in mind
  that even if you don't try to optimize process data collection, the overall
  system load by collectl can still be on the order of about 0.2% when running
  as a daemon with default collection rates. See the online documentation on
  measuring performance for more information.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
A security hole was identified that allowed non-priviledged users to read
  /proc/pid/io and guess password lengths and noe many distros retrict access to
  the owner or root. As a result, non-priviledged users will see all 0 I/O
  counts for processes that are not theirs when specifying --procopt i.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>--slabfilt Slab Filters</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">One can specify a list of slab names separated
  by commas and only those slabs whose names start with those strings will be
  listed or summaried.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>--slabopts Slab Options</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"><b>s - exclude any slabs with an allocation of
  0</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>S - only show those slabs whose allocations changed since last
  display</b></div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>--tcpfilt</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">These filters actually control both what is
  collected as well as displayed. If one selects non-collected filters, 0s will
  be reported. There is one special case and that is if one includes T (tcp
  extended stats) in the filter string, there are no brief ones and therefore
  --verbose will be forced.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>i - ip stats</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>t - tcp stats</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>u - udp stats</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>c - icmp stats</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>I - ip extended stats</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>T - tcp excented stats</b></div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>--xopts</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">i - include i/o sizes in brief mode</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>

The <b>collectl</b> utility is a system monitoring tool that records or displays
  specific operating system data for one or more sets of subsystems. Any set of
  the subsystems, such as CPU, Disks, Memory or Sockets can be included in or
  excluded from data collection. Data can either be displayed back to the
  terminal, or stored in either a compressed or uncompressed data file. The data
  files themselves can either be in <b>raw</b> format (essentially a direct copy
  from the associated /proc structures) or in a space separated <b>plottable</b>
  format such that it can be easily plotted using tools such as gnuplot or
  excel. Data files can be read and manipulated from the command line, or
  through use of command scripts.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Upon startup, <b>collectl.conf</b> is read, which sets a number of default
  parameters and switch values. Collectl searches for this file first in /etc,
  then in the directory the collectl execuable lives in (typically /usr/sbin)
  and finally the current directory. These locations can be overriden with the
  <b>-C</b> switch. Unless you're doing something really special, this file need
  never be touched, the only exception perhaps being when choosing to run
  collectl as a service and you wish to change it's default behavior which is
  set by the DaemonCommand entry.

Thread reporting currently only works with 2.6 kernels.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The pagesize has been hardcoded for perl 5.6 systems to 4096 for IA32 and 16384
  for all others. If you are running 5.6 on a system with a different pagesize
  you will see incorrect SLAB allocation sizes and will need to scale the
  numbers you're seeing accordingly.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
I have recently discovered there is a bug in /proc in that an extra line is
  occasionally read with the end of the previous buffer! When this occurs a
  message is written (if -m enabled) and always written to the terminal. Since
  this happens with a higher frequency with process data I silently ignore those
  as the output can get pretty noisey. If for any reason this is a problem, be
  sure to let me know.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Since collectl has no control over the frequency at which data gets written to
  /proc, one can get anomolous statistics as collectl is only reporting a
  snapshot of what is being recorded. For more information see
  http://collectl.sourceforge.net/TheMath.html.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
At least one network card occasionally generates erroneous network stats and to
  try to keep the data rational, collectl tries to detect this and when it does
  generates a message that bogus data has been detected.
