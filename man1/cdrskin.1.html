<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss"><b>Track recording model:</b></h2>
The input-output entities which get processed are called tracks. A <b>track</b>
  stores a stream of bytes.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
More than one track can be burned by a single run of cdrskin. In the terms of
  the MMC standard all tracks written by the same run constitute a
  <b>session</b>.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
Normally, each track is initiated by one track source address argument, which
  may either be &quot;-&quot; for standard input or the address of a readable
  file. Alternatively, option cuefile= may be used to read a session description
  from a text file and to read the session content from a single data file.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
If no write mode is given explicitly then one will be chosen which matches the
  peculiarities of track sources and the state of the output media.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Some media types can be kept appendable so that further tracks can be written to
  them in subsequent runs of cdrskin (see option -multi). Info about the
  addresses of burned tracks is kept in a table of content (TOC) on media and
  can be retrieved via cdrskin option -toc. This information is also used by the
  operating systems' CD-ROM read drivers.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In general there are two types of tracks: data and audio. They differ in sector
  size, throughput and readability via the systems' CD-ROM drivers resp. by
  music CD players. With DVD and BD there is only type data.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
If not explicitly option -audio is given, then any track is burned as type data,
  unless the track source is a file with suffix &quot;.wav&quot; or
  &quot;.au&quot; and has a header part which identifies it as MS-WAVE resp. SUN
  Audio with suitable parameters. Such files are burned as audio tracks by
  default.
<div class="Pp"></div>
While audio tracks just contain a given time span of acoustic vibrations, data
  tracks may have an arbitray meaning. Nevertheless, ISO-9660 filesystems are
  established as a format which can represent a tree of directories and files on
  all major operating systems. Such filesystem images can be produced by
  programs mkisofs or genisoimage or xorriso. They can also be extended by
  follow-up tracks if prepared properly. See the man pages of said programs.
  cdrskin is able to fulfill the needs about their option -C.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
Another type of data track content are archive formats which originally have
  been developed for magnetic tapes. Only formats which mark a detectable
  end-of-archive in their data are suitable, though. Well tested are the
  archivers afio and star. Not suitable seems GNU tar.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss"><b>Write mode selection:</b></h2>
In general there are two approaches for writing media:
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
A permissive mode depicted by option <b>-tao</b> which needs no predicted track
  size and allows to make use of eventual multi-session capabilities.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
A more restrictive mode <b>-sao</b> (alias -dao) which usually demands a
  predictable track size and is not necessarily capable of multi-session. It can
  be used to write CD-TEXT and it is the only one that works with option
  cuefile=.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
If none of the options -dao, -tao or -sao is given then the program will try to
  choose a write mode which matches the defined recording job, the capabilities
  of the drive and the state of the present media.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
So the mentioning of write modes in the following paragraphs and in the examples
  is not so much a demand that the user shall choose one explicitly, but rather
  an illustration of what to expect with particular media types.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss"><b>Recordable CD Media:</b></h2>
CD-R can be initially written only once and eventually extended until they get
  closed (or are spoiled because they are overly full). After that they are
  read-only. Closing is done automatically unless option <b>-multi</b> is given
  which keeps the media appendable.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
Write mode -tao allows to use track sources of unpredictable length (like stdin)
  and allows to write further sessions to appendable media. -sao produces audio
  sessions with seamless tracks but needs predicted track sizes and cannot
  append sessions to media.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
CD-RW media can be blanked to make them re-usable for another round of
  overwriting. Usually <b>blank=fast</b> is the appropriate option. Blanking
  damages the previous content but does not make it completely unreadable. It is
  no effective privacy precaution. Multiple cycles of blanking and overwriting
  with random numbers might be needed.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss"><b>Sequentially Recordable DVD or BD Media:</b></h2>
Currently DVD-RW, DVD-R[DL], DVD+R[DL], and BD-R can be used for the Sequential
  recording model. It resembles the model of CD media. Only DVD-RW can be
  blanked and re-used from scratch.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
DVD-RW are sequential media if they are in state &quot;Sequential
  Recording&quot;. The media must be either blank or appendable. Newly purchased
  DVD-RW and DVD-R media are in this state. Used DVD-RW get into blank
  sequential state by option <b>blank=deformat_sequential .</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
With DVD-R[W] two write modes may be available:
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
Mode DAO has many restrictions. It does not work with appendable media, allows
  no -multi and only a single track. The size of the track needs to be known in
  advance. So either its source has to be a disk file of recognizable size or
  the size has to be announced explicitly by options <b>tsize=</b> or
  <b>tao_to_sao_tsize= .</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
DAO is the only mode for DVD-R media which do not offer feature 21h Incremental
  Streaming (e.g. DVD-R DL). DAO may also be selected explicitly by option
  <b>-sao .</b> Program growisofs uses DAO on sequential DVD-R[W] media for
  maximum DVD-ROM/-Video compatibility.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
The other mode, Incremental Streaming, is the default write mode if it is
  available and if the restrictions of DAO would prevent the job. Incremental
  Streaming may be selected explicitly by option <b>-tao</b> as it resembles
  much CD TAO by allowing track sources of unpredicted length and to keep media
  appendable by option <b>-multi . It does not work with DVD-R DL and minimally
  blanked DVD-RW.</b> The only restriction towards CD-R[W] is the lack of
  support for -audio tracks. Multiple tracks per session are permissible.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
The write modes for DVD+R[/DL] and BD-R resemble those with DVD-R except that
  each track gets wrapped in an own session. There is no -dummy writing with
  DVD+R[/DL] or BD-R.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
Quite deliberately write mode -sao insists in the tradition of a predicted track
  size and blank media, whereas -tao writes the tracks open ended and allows
  appendable media.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
BD-R may be formatted before first use to enable the Defect Management which
  might catch and repair some bad spots at the expense of slow speed even with
  flawless media.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>Note:</b> Option -multi might make DVD media unreadable in some DVD-ROM
  drives. Best reader compatibility is achieved without it (i.e. by single
  session media).
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss"><b>Overwriteable DVD or BD Media:</b></h2>
Currently types DVD+RW, DVD-RW, DVD-RAM and BD-RE can be overwritten via
  cdrskin.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
Option -audio is not allowed. Only one track is allowed. Option -multi cannot
  mark a recognizable end of overwriteable media. Therefore -multi is banned
  unless ISO-9660 images shall be expandable by help of option
  <b>--grow_overwriteable_iso .</b> Without this option or without an ISO-9660
  filesystem image present on media, -toc does not return information about the
  media content and media get treated as blank regardless wether they hold data
  or not.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
Currently there is no difference between -sao and -tao. If ever, then -tao will
  be the mode which preserves the current behavior.
<div class="Pp"></div>
DVD+RW and DVD-RAM media need no special initial formatting. They offer a single
  continuous data area for blockwise random access. BD-RE need explicit
  formatting before use. See <b>blank=as_needed</b> or blank=format_defectmgt .
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
DVD-RW are sold in state &quot;Sequential Recording&quot;. To become suitable
  for the Overwriteable DVD recording model they need to get formatted to state
  &quot;Restricted Overwrite&quot;. Then they behave much like DVD+RW. This
  formatting can be done by option <b>blank=format_overwrite .</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
Several programs like dvd+rw-format, cdrecord, wodim, or cdrskin can bring a
  DVD-RW out of overwriteable state so that it has to be formatted again. If in
  doubt, just give it a try.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss"><b>Drive preparation and addressing:</b></h2>
The drives, CD, DVD, or BD burners, are accessed via addresses which are
  specific to libburn and the operating system. Those addresses get listed by a
  run of <b>cdrskin --devices</b> or <b>cdrskin --device_links</b>.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
On Linux, they are device files which traditionally do not offer w-permissions
  for normal users. Because libburn needs rw-permission, it might be only the
  <b>superuser</b> who is able to get this list without further precautions.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
It is consensus that <b>chmod a+rw /dev/sr0</b> or <b>chmod a+rw /dev/hdc</b> is
  less security sensitive than chmod u+s,a+x /usr/bin/cdrskin. The risk for the
  drive is somewhat higher but the overall system is much less at stake.
  Consider to restrict rw-access to a single group which bundles the users who
  are allowed to use the burner drive (like group &quot;floppy&quot;).
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
For drive permission examples on Linux, FreeBSD, and Solaris, see
  cdrskin/README.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you only got one CD capable drive then you may leave out cdrskin option
  <b>dev=</b>. Else you should use this option to address the drive you want.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
cdrskin option dev= not only accepts the listed addresses but also traditional
  cdrecord SCSI addresses which consist of three numbers: Bus,Target,Lun. On
  Linux there is also a related address family &quot;ATA&quot; which accesses
  IDE drives not under control of Linux SCSI drivers: ATA:Bus,Target,Lun.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
See option -scanbus for getting a list of cdrecord style addresses.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
Further are accepted: links to libburn-suitable device files, device files which
  have the same major and minor device number, and device files which have the
  same SCSI address parameters (e.g. /dev/sg0).
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss"><b>Emulated drives:</b></h2>
Option <b>--allow_emulated_drives</b> enables addressing of pseudo-drives which
  get emulated on top of filesystem objects. Regular data files and block
  devices result in pseudo-drives which behave much like DVD-RAM. If the given
  address does not exist yet but its directory exists, then it gets created as
  regular file. Other file types like character devices or pipes result in
  pseudo-drives which behave much like blank DVD-R. The target file address is
  given after prefix &quot;stdio:&quot;.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
E.g.: dev=stdio:/tmp/my_pseudo_drive
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
Addresses of the form &quot;stdio:/dev/fd/&lt;number&gt;&quot; are treated
  special. The number is read literally and used as open file descriptor. With
  dev=&quot;stdio:/dev/fd/1&quot; the normal standard output of the program is
  redirected to stderr and the stream data of a burn run will appear on stdout.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
Not good for terminals ! Redirect it.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
Pseudo-drives allow -dummy. Their reply with --tell_media_space can be utopic.
  -dummy burn runs touch the file but do not modify its data content.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
Note: --allow_emulated_drives is restricted to stdio:/dev/null if cdrskin is run
  by the <b>superuser</b> or if it has changed user identity via the
  <b>setuid</b> bit of its access permissions. The ban for the superuser can be
  lifted by a skillfully created file. See section FILES below.

      option -swab. Unless marked explicitly by option -data, input files with

    One should use this if cdrskin is working at the end of a pipe where the

  <dd class="It-tag">Do not write a session with tracks but rather make an

      Flushing the drive buffer will be the only finalization. It is advised to
      eject the media afterwards because the write operations circumvent the
      usual system i/o with its caches and buffers. By ejecting, those invalid
      memory copies get surely discarded.
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    Only few media can be written this way: DVD-RAM, BD-RE, RVD+RW and
      overwriteable DVD-RW. Writing is restricted to the already formatted area
      of the media.
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    Writing starts at byte 0 of the media or at the address given by option
      <b>write_start_address= .</b> Only the first track source is used as input
      for the write operations. The fifo (fs=) is disabled.
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    Parameter <b>size</b> controls the amount of data to be written. Size 0
      means that the track source shall be used up until EOF. In this case, the
      last write transaction gets padded up to the necessary size by zeros. Size
      -1 revokes direct writing and switches back to normal session oriented
      writing.
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    Both, write_start_address and direct_write_amount size must be aligned to a
      media dependend transaction size. With DVD-RAM, BD-RE, DVD+RW this is 2k,
      with overwriteable DVD-RW it is 32k.</dd>

      command is given with fallback_program=, and if no essential options are
      given which are specific to cdrskin, then cdrskin will delegate the job to
      said command.
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    The natural commands to be given are cdrecord or wodim but one may well
      submit the address of an own program.
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    The fallback program will get all arguments of cdrskin which do not match
      the shell patterns --?* or *_*=* . This eventually suppresses path names
      of track sources which happen to match those patterns. The options from
      the startup files are not handed to the fallback program.
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    Fallback program execution is disabled if cdrskin is run setuid and not
      option --allow_setuid is given. In general, the drive's device files and
      the involved programs should be set up so that each program runs under its
      advised conditions. (E.g. cdrskin as member of group floppy, cdrecord
      setuid root.)
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    Two alias names for cdrskin are predefined with default fallback programs:

      buffer to compensate for temporary lack of source data. At the beginning
      of burning, the software protection against buffer underun is as weak as
      the size of fifo_start_at= . So it is best if the drive offers hardware
      protection which is enabled automatically if not driveropts=noburnfree is

  <dt class="It-tag"><b>--grow_overwriteable_iso</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Enable emulation of multi-session writing on overwriteable
      media which contain an ISO-9660 filesystem. This emulation is learned from
      growisofs -M but adapted to the usage model of
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    <b>cdrskin -msinfo</b>
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    <b>mkisofs -C -M | cdrskin -waiti [-multi] -</b>
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    --grow_overwriteable_iso does not hamper the use of true multi-session
      media. I.e. it is possible to use the same cdrskin options with both kinds
      of media and to achieve similar results if ISO-9660 filesystem images are
      to be written. This option implies option -isosize and therefore demands
      that the track source is a ISO-9660 filesystem image.
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    With overwriteable media and no option blank=fast|all present it expands an
      eventual ISO-9660 filesystem on media. It is assumed that this image's
      inner size description points to the end of the valuable data.
      Overwriteable media with a recognizable ISO-9660 size will be regarded as
      appendable rather than as blank. I.e. options -msinfo and -toc will work.
      -toc will always show a single session with its size increasing with every
      added mkisofs image.
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    If not overridden by option write_start_address=, the track with the new
      image will be placed behind the end of the old one. One may use option
      assert_write_lba= to make sure that media state and mkisofs job do match.
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    --grow_overwriteable_iso causes option blank=fast|all to invalidate an
      eventual ISO-9660 image by altering the first few bytes of block 16 on
      overwriteable media. Option -multi is tolerated in order not to hamper
      true multi-session media.
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    An equivalent of growisofs -Z for overwriteable media is:
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    <b>mkisofs | cdrskin --grow_overwriteable_iso blank=fast [-multi] -</b>
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    With multi-session DVD, blank=fast will act like dvd+rw-format -blank=full .
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    growisofs -dvd-compat is roughly equivalent to cdrskin without option
      -multi.</dd>

    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    This can ease the load on operating system and drive controller and thus
      help with achieving better input bandwidth if disk and burner are not on
      independent controllers (like hda and hdb). Unsufficient input bandwidth
      is indicated by output &quot;(fifo xy%)&quot; of option -v if xy is lower
      than 90 for some time. modesty_on_drive= might hamper output bandwidth and
      cause buffer underruns.
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    To have max_percent larger than the burner's best actual buffer fill has the
      same effect as min_percent==max_percent. Some burners do not use their
      full buffer with all media types. Watch output &quot;[buf xy%]&quot; of
      option -v to get an impression of the actual buffer usage. Some burners
      are not suitable because they report buffer fill with granularity too
      large in size or time.
