<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
cdrskin - burns preformatted data to CD, DVD, and BD via
libburn.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
cdrskin [options|track_source_addresses]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
cdrskin is a program that provides some of cdrecord&rsquo;s
options in a compatible way for CD media. With DVD and BD it
has its own ways. You do not need to be superuser for its
<br>
daily usage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Overview of features: <br>
Blanking of CD-RW and DVD-RW. <br>
Formatting of DVD-RW, DVD+RW, DVD-RAM, BD. <br>
Burning of data or audio tracks to CD, <br>
either in versatile Track at Once mode (TAO) <br>
or in Session at Once mode for seamless tracks. <br>
Multi session on CD (follow-up sessions in TAO only) <br>
or on DVD-R[W] (in Incremental mode) or DVD+R[/DL] or BD-R.
<br>
Single session Disk-at-once on DVD-RW, DVD-R, DVD-R DL. <br>
Single session or emulated ISO-9660 multi-session <br>
on overwriteable DVD+RW, DVD-RW, DVD-RAM, BD-RE <br>
or on data file or block device. <br>
Bus scan, burnfree, speed options, retrieving media info,
padding, fifo. <br>
See section EXAMPLES at the end of this text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Track recording model: <br>
The input-output entities which get processed are called
tracks. A track stores a stream of bytes. <br>
More than one track can be burned by a single run of
cdrskin. In the terms of the MMC standard all tracks written
by the same run constitute a session. <br>
Normally, each track is initiated by one track source
address argument, which may either be &quot;-&quot; for
standard input or the address of a readable file.
Alternatively, option cue&acirc; <br>
file= may be used to read a session description from a text
file and to read the session content from a single data
file. <br>
If no write mode is given explicitly then one will be chosen
which matches the peculiarities of track sources and the
state of the output media.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some media types can be kept
appendable so that further tracks can be written to them in
subsequent runs of cdrskin (see option -multi). Info about
the addresses of burned <br>
tracks is kept in a table of content (TOC) on media and can
be retrieved via cdrskin option -toc. This information is
also used by the operating systems&rsquo; CD-ROM read
drivers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In general there are two types
of tracks: data and audio. They differ in sector size,
throughput and readability via the systems&rsquo; CD-ROM
drivers resp. by music CD players. With <br>
DVD and BD there is only type data. <br>
If not explicitly option -audio is given, then any track is
burned as type data, unless the track source is a file with
suffix &quot;.wav&quot; or &quot;.au&quot; and has a header
part which identi&acirc; <br>
fies it as MS-WAVE resp. SUN Audio with suitable parameters.
Such files are burned as audio tracks by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">While audio tracks just contain
a given time span of acoustic vibrations, data tracks may
have an arbitray meaning. Nevertheless, ISO-9660 filesystems
are established as a format <br>
which can represent a tree of directories and files on all
major operating systems. Such filesystem images can be
produced by programs mkisofs or genisoimage or xorriso. They
<br>
can also be extended by follow-up tracks if prepared
properly. See the man pages of said programs. cdrskin is
able to fulfill the needs about their option -C. <br>
Another type of data track content are archive formats which
originally have been developed for magnetic tapes. Only
formats which mark a detectable end-of-archive in their data
<br>
are suitable, though. Well tested are the archivers afio and
star. Not suitable seems GNU tar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Write mode selection: <br>
In general there are two approaches for writing media: <br>
A permissive mode depicted by option -tao which needs no
predicted track size and allows to make use of eventual
multi-session capabilities. <br>
A more restrictive mode -sao (alias -dao) which usually
demands a predictable track size and is not necessarily
capable of multi-session. It can be used to write CD-TEXT
and it <br>
is the only one that works with option cuefile=. <br>
If none of the options -dao, -tao or -sao is given then the
program will try to choose a write mode which matches the
defined recording job, the capabilities of the drive and the
<br>
state of the present media. <br>
So the mentioning of write modes in the following paragraphs
and in the examples is not so much a demand that the user
shall choose one explicitly, but rather an illustration of
<br>
what to expect with particular media types.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Recordable CD Media: <br>
CD-R can be initially written only once and eventually
extended until they get closed (or are spoiled because they
are overly full). After that they are read-only. Closing is
<br>
done automatically unless option -multi is given which keeps
the media appendable. <br>
Write mode -tao allows to use track sources of unpredictable
length (like stdin) and allows to write further sessions to
appendable media. -sao produces audio sessions with <br>
seamless tracks but needs predicted track sizes and cannot
append sessions to media. <br>
CD-RW media can be blanked to make them re-usable for
another round of overwriting. Usually blank=fast is the
appropriate option. Blanking damages the previous content
but does <br>
not make it completely unreadable. It is no effective
privacy precaution. Multiple cycles of blanking and
overwriting with random numbers might be needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sequentially Recordable DVD or
BD Media: <br>
Currently DVD-RW, DVD-R[DL], DVD+R[DL], and BD-R can be used
for the Sequential recording model. It resembles the model
of CD media. Only DVD-RW can be blanked and re-used from
<br>
scratch. <br>
DVD-RW are sequential media if they are in state
&quot;Sequential Recording&quot;. The media must be either
blank or appendable. Newly purchased DVD-RW and DVD-R media
are in this state. <br>
Used DVD-RW get into blank sequential state by option
blank=deformat_sequential . <br>
With DVD-R[W] two write modes may be available: <br>
Mode DAO has many restrictions. It does not work with
appendable media, allows no -multi and only a single track.
The size of the track needs to be known in advance. So
either <br>
its source has to be a disk file of recognizable size or the
size has to be announced explicitly by options tsize= or
tao_to_sao_tsize= . <br>
DAO is the only mode for DVD-R media which do not offer
feature 21h Incremental Streaming (e.g. DVD-R DL). DAO may
also be selected explicitly by option -sao . Program
growisofs <br>
uses DAO on sequential DVD-R[W] media for maximum
DVD-ROM/-Video compatibility. <br>
The other mode, Incremental Streaming, is the default write
mode if it is available and if the restrictions of DAO would
prevent the job. Incremental Streaming may be selected <br>
explicitly by option -tao as it resembles much CD TAO by
allowing track sources of unpredicted length and to keep
media appendable by option -multi . It does not work with
DVD-R <br>
DL and minimally blanked DVD-RW. The only restriction
towards CD-R[W] is the lack of support for -audio tracks.
Multiple tracks per session are permissible. <br>
The write modes for DVD+R[/DL] and BD-R resemble those with
DVD-R except that each track gets wrapped in an own session.
There is no -dummy writing with DVD+R[/DL] or BD-R. <br>
Quite deliberately write mode -sao insists in the tradition
of a predicted track size and blank media, whereas -tao
writes the tracks open ended and allows appendable media.
<br>
BD-R may be formatted before first use to enable the Defect
Management which might catch and repair some bad spots at
the expense of slow speed even with flawless media. <br>
Note: Option -multi might make DVD media unreadable in some
DVD-ROM drives. Best reader compatibility is achieved
without it (i.e. by single session media).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Overwriteable DVD or BD Media:
<br>
Currently types DVD+RW, DVD-RW, DVD-RAM and BD-RE can be
overwritten via cdrskin. <br>
Option -audio is not allowed. Only one track is allowed.
Option -multi cannot mark a recognizable end of
overwriteable media. Therefore -multi is banned unless
ISO-9660 images <br>
shall be expandable by help of option
--grow_overwriteable_iso . Without this option or without an
ISO-9660 filesystem image present on media, -toc does not
return information <br>
about the media content and media get treated as blank
regardless wether they hold data or not. <br>
Currently there is no difference between -sao and -tao. If
ever, then -tao will be the mode which preserves the current
behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DVD+RW and DVD-RAM media need no
special initial formatting. They offer a single continuous
data area for blockwise random access. BD-RE need explicit
formatting before use. See <br>
blank=as_needed or blank=format_defectmgt . <br>
DVD-RW are sold in state &quot;Sequential Recording&quot;.
To become suitable for the Overwriteable DVD recording model
they need to get formatted to state &quot;Restricted
Overwrite&quot;. Then <br>
they behave much like DVD+RW. This formatting can be done by
option blank=format_overwrite . <br>
Several programs like dvd+rw-format, cdrecord, wodim, or
cdrskin can bring a DVD-RW out of overwriteable state so
that it has to be formatted again. If in doubt, just give it
a <br>
try.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Drive preparation and
addressing: <br>
The drives, CD, DVD, or BD burners, are accessed via
addresses which are specific to libburn and the operating
system. Those addresses get listed by a run of cdrskin
--devices or <br>
cdrskin --device_links. <br>
On Linux, they are device files which traditionally do not
offer w-permissions for normal users. Because libburn needs
rw-permission, it might be only the superuser who is able
<br>
to get this list without further precautions. <br>
It is consensus that chmod a+rw /dev/sr0 or chmod a+rw
/dev/hdc is less security sensitive than chmod u+s,a+x
/usr/bin/cdrskin. The risk for the drive is somewhat higher
but the <br>
overall system is much less at stake. Consider to restrict
rw-access to a single group which bundles the users who are
allowed to use the burner drive (like group
&quot;floppy&quot;). <br>
For drive permission examples on Linux, FreeBSD, and
Solaris, see cdrskin/README.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you only got one CD capable
drive then you may leave out cdrskin option dev=. Else you
should use this option to address the drive you want. <br>
cdrskin option dev= not only accepts the listed addresses
but also traditional cdrecord SCSI addresses which consist
of three numbers: Bus,Target,Lun. On Linux there is also a
<br>
related address family &quot;ATA&quot; which accesses IDE
drives not under control of Linux SCSI drivers:
ATA:Bus,Target,Lun. <br>
See option -scanbus for getting a list of cdrecord style
addresses. <br>
Further are accepted: links to libburn-suitable device
files, device files which have the same major and minor
device number, and device files which have the same SCSI
address <br>
parameters (e.g. /dev/sg0).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Emulated drives: <br>
Option --allow_emulated_drives enables addressing of
pseudo-drives which get emulated on top of filesystem
objects. Regular data files and block devices result in
pseudo-drives <br>
which behave much like DVD-RAM. If the given address does
not exist yet but its directory exists, then it gets created
as regular file. Other file types like character devices
<br>
or pipes result in pseudo-drives which behave much like
blank DVD-R. The target file address is given after prefix
&quot;stdio:&quot;. <br>
E.g.: dev=stdio:/tmp/my_pseudo_drive <br>
Addresses of the form
&quot;stdio:/dev/fd/&lt;number&gt;&quot; are treated
special. The number is read literally and used as open file
descriptor. With dev=&quot;stdio:/dev/fd/1&quot; the normal
standard <br>
output of the program is redirected to stderr and the stream
data of a burn run will appear on stdout. <br>
Not good for terminals ! Redirect it. <br>
Pseudo-drives allow -dummy. Their reply with
--tell_media_space can be utopic. -dummy burn runs touch the
file but do not modify its data content. <br>
Note: --allow_emulated_drives is restricted to
stdio:/dev/null if cdrskin is run by the superuser or if it
has changed user identity via the setuid bit of its access
permissions. <br>
The ban for the superuser can be lifted by a skillfully
created file. See section FILES below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
--help Show non-cdrecord compatible options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-help Show cdrecord compatible
options. <br>
Note that some of the help texts are quite wrong - for
cdrecord as well as for cdrskin (e.g. -format, blank=,
-load). They are, nevertheless, traditional indicators for
<br>
the availability of the listed options. Some frontend
programs make decisions after reading them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-version <br>
Print cdrskin id line, compatibility lure line, libburn
version, cdrskin version, version timestamp, build timestamp
(if available), and then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alphabetical list of options
which are intended to be compatible with original cdrecord
by Joerg Schilling:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-atip Retrieve some info about
media state. With CD-RW print &quot;Is erasable&quot;. With
DVD media print &quot;book type:&quot; and a media type
text. With BD media print &quot;Mounted Media:&quot; and
<br>
media type text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-audio Announces that the
subsequent tracks are to be burned as audio. The source is
supposed to be uncompressed headerless PCM, 44100 Hz, 16
bit, stereo. For little-endian byte <br>
order (which is usual on PCs) use option -swab. Unless
marked explicitly by option -data, input files with suffix
&quot;.wav&quot; are examined wether they have a header in
MS-WAVE <br>
format confirming those parameters and eventually raw audio
data get extracted and burned as audio track. Same is done
for suffix &quot;.au&quot; and SUN Audio. <br>
Option -audio may be used only with CD media and not with
DVD or BD.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">blank=type <br>
Blank a CD-RW, DVD-RW, or format a DVD-RW, DVD+RW, DVD-RAM,
BD. This is combinable with burning in the same run of
cdrskin. The type given with blank= selects the par&acirc;
<br>
ticular behavior:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">as_needed <br>
Try to make the media ready for writing from scratch. If it
needs formatting, then format it. If it is not blank, then
try to apply blank=fast. It is a reason to <br>
abort if the media cannot assume thoroughly writeable state,
e.g. if it is non-blank write-once. <br>
This leaves unformatted DVD-RW in unformatted blank state.
To format DVD-RW use blank=format_overwriteable. Blank
unformatted BD-R stay unformatted. <br>
(Note: blank=as_needed is not an original cdrecord
option.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following blank types are
specific to particular media familes. Use them if special
features are desired.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">all Blank an entire CD-RW or an
unformatted DVD-RW. (See also --prodvd_cli_compatible,
--grow_overwriteable_iso)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fast Minimally blank an entire
CD-RW or blank an unformatted DVD-RW. (See also
--prodvd_cli_compatible, --grow_overwriteable_iso)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">deformat_sequential <br>
Like blank=all but with the additional ability to blank
overwriteable DVD-RW. This will destroy their formatting and
make them sequentially recordable. Another <br>
peculiarity is the ability to blank media which appear
already blank. This is similar to option -force but does not
try to blank media other than recognizable CD- <br>
RW and DVD-RW. <br>
(Note: blank=deformat_* are not original cdrecord
options.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">deformat_sequential_quickest
<br>
Like blank=deformat_sequential but blanking DVD-RW only
minimally. This is faster than full blanking but may yield
media incapable of Incremental Streaming (-tao).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">format_if_needed <br>
Format a media if it is not formatted yet, and if cdrskin
supports formatting for the media type, and if formatting
will not happen automatically during write. <br>
This currently applies to unformatted DVD-RW, DVD-RAM,
BD-RE, and blank unformatted BD-R. Eventually the
appropriate default formatting is chosen. If other media
<br>
or states are encountered then nothing happens. <br>
The following formatting types are more specialized to
particular media families.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">format_overwrite <br>
Format a DVD-RW to &quot;Restricted Overwrite&quot;. The
user should bring some patience. <br>
(Note: blank=format_* are not original cdrecord
options.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">format_overwrite_quickest <br>
Like format_overwrite without creating a 128 MiB trailblazer
session. Leads to &quot;intermediate&quot; state which only
allows sequential write beginning from address 0. <br>
The &quot;intermediate&quot; state ends after the first
session of writing data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">format_overwrite_full <br>
For DVD-RW this is like format_overwrite but claims full
media size rather than just 128 MiB. Most traditional
formatting is attempted. No data get written. Much <br>
patience is required. <br>
This option treats already formatted media even if not
option -force is given. <br>
For DVD+RW this is the only supported explicit formatting
type. It provides complete &quot;de-icing&quot; so no reader
slips on unwritten data areas.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">format_defectmgt <br>
Format DVD-RAM or BD to reserve the default amount of spare
blocks for defect management. <br>
The following format_defectmgt_* allow to submit user wishes
which nevertheless have to match one of the available
formats. These formats are offered by the drive <br>
after examining the media.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">format_defectmgt_cert_off <br>
Disable the usual media quality certification in order to
save time and format to default size. The certification
setting persists even if subsequent blank= <br>
options override the size of the format selection. <br>
Whether formatting without certification works properly
depends much on the drive. One should check the &quot;Format
status:&quot; from --list_formats afterwards.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">format_defectmgt_cert_on <br>
Re-enable the usual media quality certification and format
to default size. The certification setting persists like
with format_defectmgt_cert_off. <br>
Whether there happens certification at all depends much on
the media state and the actually selected format
descriptor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">format_defectmgt_max <br>
Format DVD-RAM or BD to reserve a maximum number of spare
blocks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">format_defectmgt_min <br>
Format DVD-RAM or BD to reserve a minimum number of spare
blocks. It might be necessary to format
format_defectmgt_none first in order to get offered the most
min&acirc; <br>
mal spare blocks sizes for format_defectmgt_min.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">format_defectmgt_none <br>
Format DVD-RAM or BD-RE to the largest available payload in
the hope to disable defect management at all. This may or
may not have a speed increasing effect. <br>
Unformatted blank BD-R will be left unformatted.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">format_defectmgt_payload_&lt;size&gt;
<br>
Format DVD-RAM or BD. The text after
&quot;format_defectmgt_payload_&quot; gives a number of
bytes, eventually with suffixes &quot;s&quot;,
&quot;k&quot;, &quot;m&quot;. The largest number of spare
blocks <br>
will be chosen which allows at least the given payload
size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">format_by_index_&lt;number&gt;
<br>
Format DVD-RW, DVD+RW, DVD-RAM or BD. The number after
&quot;format_by_index_&quot; is used as index to the list of
available format descriptors. This list can be obtained <br>
by option --list_formats. The numbers after text
&quot;Format idx&quot; are the ones to be used with
format_by_index_. Format descriptor lists are volatile. Do
neither eject <br>
nor write the media between the run of --list_formats and
the run of blank=format_by_index_ or else you may get a
different format than desired.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">help Print this list of blanking
types.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-checkdrive <br>
Retrieve some info about the addressed drive and then exit.
Exits with non-zero value if the drive cannot be found and
opened.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-copy Create the subsequent
tracks with permission for an unlimited number of
copies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cuefile=path <br>
Read a session description from a cue sheet file in CDRWIN
format. Base the tracks on a single file which is given in
the sheet by command FILE. To enable CD-TEXT from <br>
the cue sheet file, cdrskin option -text has to be present.
<br>
cdrskin currently supports TRACK datatypes AUDIO and
MODE1/2048 which may not be mixed. Data source may be of
FILE type BINARY, MOTOROLA, or WAVE. <br>
Non-CDRWIN commands ARRANGER, COMPOSER, MESSAGE are
supported. <br>
Cue sheet file commands CATALOG and ISRC may be overridden
by option mcn= and by input_sheet_v07t= purpose specifiers
&quot;UPC / EAN&quot; and &quot;ISRC&quot;. This does not
affect their <br>
appearance in CD-TEXT, but only on Q sub-channel. <br>
The track numbers may be overridden by option
cd_start_tno=.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dao Alias for option -sao.
Write CD in Session at Once mode or DVD-R[W] in Disc-at-once
mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-data Subsequent tracks are data
tracks. This option is default and only needed to mark the
end of the range of an eventual option -audio or -xa1. <br>
Options -mode2, -xa, and -xa2 get mapped to -data, not using
the desired CD sector formats and thus not taking advantage
of eventual higher payload. -xa1 Subsequent <br>
tracks are data tracks with input suitable for CD-ROM XA
mode 2 form 1. This differs from -data input by 8 additional
header bytes per block. cdrskin will not write CD- <br>
ROM XA but rather strip the header bytes and write as -data
tracks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dev=target <br>
Set the address of the drive to use. Valid are at least the
addresses listed with options --devices or --device_links,
X,Y,Z addresses listed with option -scanbus, <br>
ATA:X,Y,Z addresses listed with options dev=ATA -scanbus,
and volatile libburn drive numbers (numbering starts at
&quot;0&quot;). Other device file addresses which lead to
the same <br>
drive might work too. <br>
If no dev= is given, volatile address &quot;dev=0&quot; is
assumed. That is the first drive found being available.
Better avoid this ambiguity on systems with more than one
drive. <br>
The special target &quot;help&quot; lists hints about
available addressing formats. Be aware that deprecated
option --old_pseudo_scsi_adr may change the meaning of
Bus,Target,Lun <br>
addresses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">driveropts=opt <br>
Set &quot;driveropts=noburnfree&quot; to disable the
drive&rsquo;s eventual protection mechanism against
temporary lack of source data (i.e. buffer underrun). A
drive that announces no <br>
such capabilities will not get them enabled anyway, even if
attempted explicitly via
&quot;driveropts=burnfree&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dummy Try to perform the drive
operations without actually affecting the inserted media.
There is no warranty that this will work with a particular
combination of drive, media, <br>
and write mode. Blanking is prevented reliably, though. To
avoid inadverted real burning, -dummy refuses burn runs on
anything but CD-R[W], DVD-R[W], or emulated stdio- <br>
drives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-eject Eject the disc after work
is done.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-force Assume that the user
knows better in situations when cdrskin or libburn are
insecure about drive or media state. This includes the
attempt to blank media which are classi&acirc; <br>
fied as unknown or unsuitable, and the attempt to use write
modes which libburn believes they are not supported by the
drive. <br>
Another application is to enforce blanking or re-formatting
of media which appear to be in the desired blank or format
state already. <br>
This option enables a burn run with option -dummy even if
libburn believes that drive and media will not simulate the
write mode but will write for real. <br>
It enables a burn run where cdrskin expects to exceed the
available media capacity. <br>
Caution: Use this only when in urgent need.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-format <br>
Same as blank=format_overwrite_full -force but restricted to
DVD+RW.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fs=size <br>
Set the fifo size to the given value. The value may have
appended letters which multiply the preceding number: <br>
&quot;k&quot; or &quot;K&quot; = 1024 , &quot;m&quot; or
&quot;M&quot; = 1024k , &quot;g&quot; or &quot;G&quot; =
1024m , &quot;s&quot; or &quot;S&quot; = 2048 <br>
Set size to 0 in order to disable the fifo (default is
&quot;4m&quot;). <br>
The fifo buffers an eventual temporary surplus of track
source data in order to provide the drive with a steady
stream during times of temporary lack of track source
sup&acirc; <br>
ply. The larger the fifo, the longer periods of poor source
supply can be compensated. But a large fifo needs
substantial time to fill up if not curbed via option <br>
fifo_start_at=size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gracetime=seconds <br>
Set the grace time before starting to write. (Default is
0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-immed Equivalent to: <br>
modesty_on_drive=1:min_percent=75:max_percent=95 <br>
The name of this cdrecord option stems from the
&quot;Immed&quot; bit which can make some long running drive
commands asynchronous and thus eases the load on some wiring
hardware <br>
types. Regardless of option -immed, cdrskin uses
asynchronous commands where possible and appropriate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">index=list <br>
Set a comma separated list of index start address numbers
for the next track. This applies to CD SAO sessions only.
<br>
The addresses count sectors from the start of the next
track. The first number is for index 1 and must be 0. The
following numbers have to be larger than their respective
<br>
predecessors. Up to 99 numbers are allowed. <br>
Sector numbers are computed from Min:Sec:Frame addresses by
<br>
Sector = ((Min*60)+Sec)*75+Frame <br>
E.g.: &quot;0,7512,20408&quot; sets index 2 to 01:40:12 and
index 3 to 04:32:08.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-inq Print the identification of
the drive and then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-isosize <br>
The next track following this option will try to obtain its
source size from the header information out of the first few
blocks of the source data. If these blocks indi&acirc; <br>
cate an ISO-9660 filesystem then its declared size will be
used under the assumption that it is a single session
filesystem. <br>
If not, then the burn run will be aborted. <br>
The range of -isosize is exactly one track. Further tracks
may be preceded by further -isosize options, though. At
least 15 blocks of padding will be added to each -iso&acirc;
<br>
size track. But be advised to rather use padsize=300k. <br>
This option can be performed on track sources which are
regular files or block devices. For the first track of the
session it can be performed on any type of source if <br>
there is a fifo of at least 64 kiB. See option fs= .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">isrc=text <br>
Set the ISRC for the next track source to the given text,
which must be exactly 13 characters long. It must comply to
the format CCOOOYYSSSSS. <br>
CC is the country code. OOO is the owner code. Both may
consist of capital letters A to Z and of decimal digits 0 to
9. YY depicts the year (00 to 99). SSSSS is the <br>
serial number (00000 to 99999). <br>
This option does not affect CD-TEXT but only the Q
sub-channel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-load Load the media and exit.
Exit value is 0 if any kind of media was found, non zero
else. Note: Option -eject will unload the media even if
-load is given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-lock Like option -load but
leave the drive&rsquo;s eject button disabled if there is
any media found and not option -eject is given. <br>
Use program &quot;eject&quot; or cdrskin -eject to get the
tray out of the drive. Runs of programs like cdrecord,
growisofs, wodim, cdrskin will not be hampered and normally
enable <br>
the drive&rsquo;s eject button when they are done.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mcn=text <br>
Set the CD Media Catalog Number to text, which must be
exactly 13 characters long and should consist of decimal
digits. <br>
This option does not affect CD-TEXT but only the Q
sub-channel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">minbuf=percentage <br>
Equivalent to: <br>

modesty_on_drive=1:min_percent=&lt;percentage&gt;:max_percent=95
<br>
Percentage is permissible between 25 and 95.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-minfo Print information about
the loaded media. This includes media type, writability
state, and a quite readable table of content.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">msifile=path <br>
Run option -msinfo and copy the result line into the file
given by path. Unlike -msinfo this option does not redirect
all normal output away from standard output. But it <br>
may be combined with -msinfo to achieve this. <br>
Note: msifile=path is actually an option of wodim and not of
cdrecord.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msinfo <br>
Retrieve multi-session info for preparing a follow-up
session by option -C of programs mkisofs, genisoimage, or
xorriso -as mkisofs. Print result to standard output. <br>
This option redirects to stderr all message output except
the one of option --tell_media_space and its own result
string, which consists of two numbers. The result string
<br>
shall be used as argument of option -C with said programs.
It gives the start address of the most recent session and
the predicted start address of the next session to be <br>
appended. The string is empty if the most recent session was
not written with option -multi. <br>
To have a chance for working on overwriteable media, this
option has to be accompanied by option
--grow_overwriteable_iso.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-multi This option keeps CD,
unformatted DVD-R[W], DVD+R, or BD-R appendable after the
current session has been written. Without it the disc gets
closed and may not be written <br>
any more - unless it is a -RW and gets blanked which causes
loss of its content. <br>
The following sessions can only be written in -tao mode.
-multi is prohibited with DVD-R[W] DAO write mode and on
DVD-R DL media. Option --prodvd_cli_compatible eventu&acirc;
<br>
ally makes -multi tolerable but cannot make it work. <br>
In order to have all filesystem content accessible, the
eventual ISO-9660 filesystem of a follow-up session needs to
be prepared in a special way by the filesystem format&acirc;
<br>
ter program. mkisofs and genisoimage expect particular info
about the situation which can be retrieved by cdrskin option
-msinfo. <br>
To retrieve an archive file which was written as follow-up
session, you may use option -toc to learn about the
&quot;lba&quot; of the desired track number. This lba is the
address <br>
of the 2048 byte block where the archive begins. <br>
With overwriteable DVD or BD media, -multi cannot mark the
end of the session. So when adding a new session this end
has to be determined from the payload. Currently <br>
only ISO-9660 filesystems can be used that way. See option
--grow_overwriteable_iso for lifting the ban on -multi. <br>
Note: -multi might make DVD media unreadable in some DVD-ROM
drives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nocopy <br>
Create subsequent tracks with permission for a single level
of copies. I.e. those copies would then be marked by -scms
as offering no permission for further copies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nopad Do not add trailing zeros
to the data stream. Nevertheless, since there seems to be no
use for audio tracks with incomplete last sector, this
option applies only to data <br>
tracks. There it is default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nopreemp <br>
Indicate for subsequent tracks that they were mastered
without pre-emphasis.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pad Add 30 kiB of trailing
zeros to each data track. (This is not sufficient to avoid
problems with various CD-ROM read drivers.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">padsize=size <br>
Add the given amount of trailing zeros to the next data
track. This option gets reset to padsize=0 after that next
track is written. It may be set again before the next <br>
track argument. About size specifiers, see option fs=.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-preemp <br>
Indicate for subsequent tracks that they were mastered with
pre-emphasis.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sao Write CD in Session At Once
mode or sequential DVD-R[W] in Disc-at-once (DAO) mode. <br>
With CD this mode is able to put several audio tracks on
media without producing audible gaps between them. <br>
With DVD-R[W] this mode can only write a single track. No
-multi is allowed with DVD-R[W] -sao. <br>
-sao is permissible with overwriteable DVD, or DVD+R[/DL],
or BD but actually only imposes restrictions without
providing known advantages. <br>
-sao can only be used for tracks of fixely predicted size.
This implies that track arguments which depict stdin or
named pipes need to be preceded by option tsize= or by <br>
option tao_to_sao_tsize=. <br>
-sao cannot be used on appendable media.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-scanbus <br>
Scan the system for drives. On Linux the drives at /dev/s*
and at /dev/hd* are to be scanned by two separate runs. One
without dev= for /dev/s* and one with dev=ATA for <br>
/dev/hd* devices. (Option --drives lists all available
drives in a single run.) <br>
Drives which are busy or which offer no rw-permission to the
user of cdrskin are not listed. Busy drives get reported in
form of warning messages. <br>
The useful fields in a result line are: <br>
Bus,Target,Lun Number) &rsquo;Vendor&rsquo;
&rsquo;Mode&rsquo; &rsquo;Revision&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-scms Create subsequent tracks
without permission for being copied. This is usually done
for tracks which are copies of tracks that were marked with
-nocopy (but not yet with <br>
-scms). So copies of copies are prohibited. <br>
This option gets reset by option -copy. Thus the combination
-copy -nocopy means -nocopy surely without -scms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">speed=number <br>
Set speed of drive. With data CD, 1x speed corresponds to a
throughput of 150,000 bytes/second. With DVD, 1x = 1,385,000
bytes/second. With BD 1x = 4,495,625 bytes/sec&acirc; <br>
ond. It is not an error to set a speed higher than is
suitable for drive and media. One should stay within a
realistic speed range, though. Special speed settings are:
<br>
0 = minimal speed , -1 = maximal speed (default), text
&quot;any&quot; = like -1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-swab Announce that the raw
audio data source of subsequent tracks is byte swapped
versus the expectations of cdrecord. This option is suitable
for audio where the least signif&acirc; <br>
icant byte of a 16 bit word is first (little-endian, Intel).
Most raw audio data on PC systems are available in this byte
order. Less guesswork is needed if track <br>
sources are in format MS-WAVE in a file with suffix
&quot;.wav&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-tao Write CD in Track At Once
(TAO) mode, sequential DVD-R[W] in Incremental Streaming
mode, or DVD+R[/DL] without traditional -sao restrictions.
This mode also applies pro- <br>
forma to overwriteable media <br>
Mode -tao can be used with track sources of unpredictable
size, like standard input or named pipes. It is also the
only mode that can be used for writing to appendable <br>
media which already hold data. With unformatted DVD-R[W] it
is the only mode which allows -multi. <br>
Mode -tao is not usable for minimally blanked DVD-RW and for
DVD-R DL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-text Enable writing of CD-TEXT
attributes read by option cuefile=. Without option -text,
cue sheet file command CDTEXTFILE will be ignored and no
CD-TEXT attributes will be <br>
read from the file. Nevertheless, CATALOG and ISRC will have
the same effect as options mcn= and isrc=.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">textfile=path <br>
Read CD-TEXT packs from the file depicted by path and put
them into the Lead-in of the emerging session. This session
has to be done by Session At Once (SAO) mode and may <br>
only contain audio tracks. <br>
path must lead to a regular file, which consists of an
optional header of four bytes and one or more text packs of
18 bytes each. Suitable would be the file
&rsquo;cdtext.dat&rsquo; <br>
which gets extracted from CD media by options -vv -toc and
shown in human readable form by -vvv -toc. <br>
The header, if present, must tell the file size minus 2,
encoded as big-endian 16 bit word. The other two bytes must
be 0. <br>
If there is no 4-byte header, then a trailing 0-byte, as of
Sony specification, is tolerated and ignored. <br>
A text pack consists of a pack type byte, a track number
byte, a counter byte, a Block Number and Character Indicator
byte, 12 text characters or data bytes, two optional <br>
CRC bytes. For details see libburn documentation file
doc/cdtext.txt. <br>
By default, the input file is checked for correct CRC bytes.
If all CRC bytes are 0, then the correct values get silently
inserted. If there are non-zero CRC bytes, then a <br>
mismatch causes the abort of the burn run. This check can be
disabled by option -force. <br>
Note that this option overrides option input_sheet_v07t=
.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-toc Print the table of content
(TOC) which describes the tracks recorded on disc. The
output contains all info from option -atip plus lines which
begin with &quot;track:&quot;, the <br>
track number, the word &quot;lba:&quot; and a number which
gives the start address of the track. Addresses are counted
in CD sectors which with SAO or TAO data tracks hold 2048
<br>
bytes each. <br>
If verbosity is set to level 2 (-v -v) then the CD-TEXT
packs from the lead-in of an audio CD get extracted and
written into file &rsquo;cdtext.dat&rsquo;, if that file
does not yet <br>
exist. Prepended is a 4 byte header, followed by one or more
packs of 18 bytes each. <br>
Verbosity level 3 causes the CD-TEXT packs to be printed as
hex numbers to standard output. Bytes 4 to 15 of certain
pack types are printed as ASCII characters if they <br>
have values in the range of 32 to 126. <br>
See option textfile= for more information about the text
pack format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example. Retrieve an afio
archive from track number 2: <br>
tracknumber=2 <br>
lba=$(cdrskin dev=/dev/cdrom -toc 2&gt;&amp;1 | grep
&rsquo;^track:[ ]*[ 0-9][0-9]&rsquo; | tail
+&quot;$tracknumber&quot; | head -1 | awk &rsquo;{ print
$4}&rsquo; ) <br>
dd if=/dev/cdrom bs=2048 skip=&quot;$lba&quot; | afio -t - |
less</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tsize=size <br>
Announces the exact size of the next track source. This is
necessary with any write mode other than -tao if the track
source is not a regular disk file, but e.g. &quot;-&quot;
<br>
(standard input) or a named pipe. About size specifiers, see
option fs=. <br>
If the track source does not deliver the predicted amount of
bytes, the remainder of the track is padded with zeros. This
is not considered an error. If on the other hand <br>
the track source delivers more than the announced bytes then
the track on media gets truncated to the predicted size and
cdrskin exits with non-zero value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Increment verbosity level by
one. Startlevel is 0 with only few messages. Level 1 prints
progress report with long running operations and also causes
some extra lines to <br>
be put out with info retrieval options. Level 2 additionally
reports about option settings derived from arguments or
startup files. Level 3 is for debugging and useful <br>
mainly in conjunction with somebody who had a look into the
program sourcecode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Enable logging of SCSI
commands to stderr. This allows expert examination of the
interaction between libburn and the drive. The commands are
specified in SCSI-3 standards <br>
SPC, SBC, MMC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-waiti Wait until input data is
available at stdin or EOF occurs at stdin. Only then begin
to access any drives. <br>
One should use this if cdrskin is working at the end of a
pipe where the feeder process reads from the drive before it
starts writing its output into cdrskin. Example: <br>
mkisofs ... -C 0,12800 -M /dev/sr0 | cdrskin dev=/dev/sr0
... -waiti - <br>
This option works even if stdin is not among the track
sources. If no process is piping in, then the Enter key of
your terminal will act as trigger for cdrskin. Note that
<br>
this input line will not be consumed by cdrskin if stdin is
not among the track sources. It will end up as shell
command, usually.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alphabetical list of options
which are genuine to cdrskin and intended for normal
use:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--adjust_speed_to_drive <br>
Curb explicitly given speed= values to the maximum which is
announced by the drive for the loaded media. By default,
such an adjustment is only made with pseudo-speeds 0 <br>
and -1 whereas speed settings &gt; 0 are sent unchanged to
the drive which will then choose an appropriate speed on its
own.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--allow_emulated_drives <br>
Enable drive addresses of the form dev=stdio:&lt;path&gt;.
See above, paragraph &quot;Drive preparation and
addressing&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--allow_setuid <br>
Disable the loud warning about insecure discrepance between
login user and effective user which indicates application of
chmod u+s to the program binary. One should not <br>
do this chmod u+s , but it is an old cdrecord tradition.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--any_track <br>
Allow source_addresses to begin with &quot;-&quot; (plus
further characters) or to contain a &quot;=&quot; character.
By default such arguments are seen as misspelled options. It
is never&acirc; <br>
theless not possible to use one of the options listed with
--list_ignored_options.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">assert_write_lba=block_number|byte_address
<br>
Abort if the write address given with this option is not the
same as predicted immediately before the write session
starts. This option can ensure that a start address <br>
which was presumed by a formatter like mkisofs -C is really
used by the drive for writing. assert_write_lba=0
effectively demands blank media and excludes appendables.
<br>
Block numbering is peculiar: If the last character of the
option string is a letter [a-zA-Z] then the usual unit
scaling by &quot;s&quot;, &quot;k&quot;, &quot;m&quot;, etc.
applies and the result is <br>
divided by 2048. Else the number value of the string is
taken as plain block number with block size 2048 byte. (E.g
...=1000 or ...=1000s means block 1000, ...=1m means <br>
block 512, ...=4096b means block number 2)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cd_start_tno=number <br>
Set the number which shall be written as CD track number
with the first track of the session. The following tracks
will then get written with consecutive CD track numbers.
<br>
The resulting number of the last track must not exceed 99.
The lowest possible start number is 1, which is also the
default. <br>
This setting applies only to CD SAO writing. It overrides
the track number settings caused by options cuefile= or
input_sheet_v07t=.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--demand_a_drive <br>
Exit with a nonzero value if no drive can be found during a
bus scan.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--devices <br>
List the device file addresses of all accessible CD drives.
In order to get listed, a drive has to offer rw-permission
for the cdrskin user and it may not be busy. The <br>
superuser should be able to see all idle drives listed and
busy drives reported as &quot;SORRY&quot; messages. <br>
Each available drive gets listed by a line containing the
following fields: <br>
Number dev=&rsquo;Devicefile&rsquo; rw-Permissions :
&rsquo;Vendor&rsquo; &rsquo;Model&rsquo; <br>
Number and Devicefile can both be used with option dev=, but
number is volatile (numbering changes if drives become
busy).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--device_links <br>
Like --devices, but presenting the drives with addresses of
symbolic links which point to the actual device files. <br>
Modern GNU/Linux systems may shuffle drive addresses from
boot to boot. The udev daemon is supposed to create links
which always point to the same drive, regardless of <br>
its system address. Option --device_links shows the
addresses of such links if they begin by
&quot;/dev/dvd&quot; or &quot;/dev/cd&quot;. Precedence is:
&quot;dvdrw&quot;, &quot;cdrw&quot;, &quot;dvd&quot;,
&quot;cdrom&quot;, <br>
&quot;cd&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">direct_write_amount=size <br>
Do not write a session with tracks but rather make an
appropriate number of direct write operations with no
preparations. Flushing the drive buffer will be the only
final&acirc; <br>
ization. It is advised to eject the media afterwards because
the write operations circumvent the usual system i/o with
its caches and buffers. By ejecting, those invalid <br>
memory copies get surely discarded. <br>
Only few media can be written this way: DVD-RAM, BD-RE,
RVD+RW and overwriteable DVD-RW. Writing is restricted to
the already formatted area of the media. <br>
Writing starts at byte 0 of the media or at the address
given by option write_start_address= . Only the first track
source is used as input for the write operations. The <br>
fifo (fs=) is disabled. <br>
Parameter size controls the amount of data to be written.
Size 0 means that the track source shall be used up until
EOF. In this case, the last write transaction gets <br>
padded up to the necessary size by zeros. Size -1 revokes
direct writing and switches back to normal session oriented
writing. <br>
Both, write_start_address and direct_write_amount size must
be aligned to a media dependend transaction size. With
DVD-RAM, BD-RE, DVD+RW this is 2k, with overwriteable <br>
DVD-RW it is 32k.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dvd_obs=default|32k|64k <br>
Linux specific: Set the number of bytes to be transmitted
with each write operation to DVD or BD media. With most
write types, tracks get padded up to the next multiple of
<br>
this write size (see option --obs_pad). A number of 64 KB
may improve throughput with systems which show latency
problems. The default depends on media type, option <br>
stream_recording=, and on compile time options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fallback_program=command <br>
Set a command name to be executed if cdrskin encounters a
known cdrecord option which it does not yet support. If a
non-empty command is given with fallback_program=, and <br>
if no essential options are given which are specific to
cdrskin, then cdrskin will delegate the job to said command.
<br>
The natural commands to be given are cdrecord or wodim but
one may well submit the address of an own program. <br>
The fallback program will get all arguments of cdrskin which
do not match the shell patterns --?* or *_*=* . This
eventually suppresses path names of track sources which <br>
happen to match those patterns. The options from the startup
files are not handed to the fallback program. <br>
Fallback program execution is disabled if cdrskin is run
setuid and not option --allow_setuid is given. In general,
the drive&rsquo;s device files and the involved programs
<br>
should be set up so that each program runs under its advised
conditions. (E.g. cdrskin as member of group floppy,
cdrecord setuid root.) <br>
Two alias names for cdrskin are predefined with default
fallback programs: <br>
unicord implies fallback_program=cdrecord <br>
codim implies fallback_program=wodim</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--four_channel <br>
Indicate for subsequent tracks that they were mastered with
four channels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fifo_start_at=size <br>
Do not wait for full fifo but start burning as soon as the
given number of bytes is read. This option may be helpful to
bring the average throughput near to the maximum <br>
throughput of a drive. A large fs= and a small
fifo_start_at= combine a quick burn start and a large
savings buffer to compensate for temporary lack of source
data. At the <br>
beginning of burning, the software protection against buffer
underun is as weak as the size of fifo_start_at= . So it is
best if the drive offers hardware protection which <br>
is enabled automatically if not driveropts=noburnfree is
given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--grow_overwriteable_iso <br>
Enable emulation of multi-session writing on overwriteable
media which contain an ISO-9660 filesystem. This emulation
is learned from growisofs -M but adapted to the usage <br>
model of <br>
cdrskin -msinfo <br>
mkisofs -C -M | cdrskin -waiti [-multi] - <br>
--grow_overwriteable_iso does not hamper the use of true
multi-session media. I.e. it is possible to use the same
cdrskin options with both kinds of media and to achieve <br>
similar results if ISO-9660 filesystem images are to be
written. This option implies option -isosize and therefore
demands that the track source is a ISO-9660 filesystem <br>
image. <br>
With overwriteable media and no option blank=fast|all
present it expands an eventual ISO-9660 filesystem on media.
It is assumed that this image&rsquo;s inner size description
<br>
points to the end of the valuable data. Overwriteable media
with a recognizable ISO-9660 size will be regarded as
appendable rather than as blank. I.e. options -msinfo <br>
and -toc will work. -toc will always show a single session
with its size increasing with every added mkisofs image.
<br>
If not overridden by option write_start_address=, the track
with the new image will be placed behind the end of the old
one. One may use option assert_write_lba= to make <br>
sure that media state and mkisofs job do match. <br>
--grow_overwriteable_iso causes option blank=fast|all to
invalidate an eventual ISO-9660 image by altering the first
few bytes of block 16 on overwriteable media. Option <br>
-multi is tolerated in order not to hamper true
multi-session media. <br>
An equivalent of growisofs -Z for overwriteable media is:
<br>
mkisofs | cdrskin --grow_overwriteable_iso blank=fast
[-multi] - <br>
With multi-session DVD, blank=fast will act like
dvd+rw-format -blank=full . <br>
growisofs -dvd-compat is roughly equivalent to cdrskin
without option -multi.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">input_sheet_v07t=path <br>
Read CD-TEXT definitions from a Sony Input Sheet version
0.7T. Up to eight or seven such sheets can be read by
multiple input_sheet_v07t= options. Each will define a CD-
<br>
TEXT language block. <br>
The information in such a sheet is given by text lines of
the following form: <br>
purpose specifier [whitespace] = [whitespace] content text
<br>
[whitespace] is zero or more ASCII 32 (space) or ASCII 9
(tab) characters. The purpose specifier tells the meaning of
the content text. Empty content text does not cause <br>
a CD-TEXT attribute to be attached. <br>
The following purpose specifiers apply to the session as a
whole: <br>
Purpose specifier | Content example <br>

First Track Number = 1 <br>
Last Track Number = 3 <br>
The following purpose specifiers apply to particular tracks:
<br>
Purpose specifier | Content example <br>

-------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
Track 01 Title = Song of Joy <br>
Track 01 Artist = Felix and The Purrs <br>
Track 01 Songwriter = Friedrich Schiller <br>
Track 01 Composer = Ludwig van Beethoven <br>
Track 01 Arranger = Tom Cat <br>
Track 01 Message = Fritz and Louie once were punks <br>
ISRC 01 = XYCRR1101234 <br>
Track numbers are decimal despite the leading 0. There
should be as many track definitions as there are track
source files given. <br>
See libburn&rsquo;s doc/cdtext.txt for a detailed definition
of 0.7T and the possible values for Text Code, Language
Code, Genre Code, Text Data Copy Protection. <br>
The Q sub-channel settings by &quot;UPC / EAN&quot; and
&quot;ISRC&quot; may be overridden by options mcn= and
isrc=. This will not affect their appearance as CD-TEXT.
They may override <br>
cuefile= commands CATALOG and ISRC in the same way. <br>
If options -text cuefile= are given and if the cue sheet
file defines CD-TEXT, then only seven input_sheet_v07t=
options may be given. They will then be used as CD-TEXT <br>
language blocks 1 to 7. <br>
This option will get into effect only if no option textfile=
is given. The write mode must be SAO on CD. All tracks must
be -audio tracks. <br>
The track numbers may be overridden by option
cd_start_tno=.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--list_formats <br>
List the available format descriptors as reported by the
drive for the loaded media. Each descriptor line begins with
&quot;Format idx&quot; and the descriptor&rsquo;s list
index, fol&acirc; <br>
lowed by a &quot;:&quot;, the format type, the number of
payload blocks and that same number converted to MiB. <br>
The meaning of the format types is defined by the MMC
standard with command FORMAT UNIT. A user will more be
interested in the sizes than in the types.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--list_ignored_options <br>
List all ignored cdrecord options. The &quot;-&quot; options
cannot be used as addresses of track sources. No track
source address may begin with a text equal to an option
which <br>
ends by &quot;=&quot;. The list is ended by an empty
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--list_speeds <br>
Put out a list of speed values as reported by the output
drive with the loaded medium. This does not necessarily mean
that the medium is writable or that these speeds are <br>
actually achievable. Especially the lists reported with
empty drive or with ROM media obviously advertise speeds for
other media. <br>
It is not mandatory to use speed values out of the listed
range. The drive is supposed to choose a safe speed that is
as near to the desired speed as possible. <br>
At the end of the list, &quot;Write speed L&quot; and
&quot;Write speed H&quot; are the best guesses for lower and
upper speed limit. &quot;Write speed l&quot; and &quot;Write
speed h&quot; may appear only with <br>
CD and eventually override the list of other speed offers.
<br>
Only if the drive reports contradicting speed information
there will appear &quot;Write speed 0&quot; or &quot;Write
speed-1&quot;, which tell the outcome of speed selection by
options <br>
speed=0 resp. speed=-1, if it deviates from &quot;Write
speed L&quot; resp. &quot;Write speed H&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--long_toc <br>
Like option -toc but marking each session start by a line
&quot;first: X last: Y&quot; and each session end by
&quot;track:lout ...&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no_load <br>
When aquiring the optical drive, do not try to load its
tray. This yields the same behavior for desktop drives with
tray loader as is shown by laptop drives which usually <br>
lack a motorized tray loader.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no_rc <br>
Only if used as first command line argument this option
prevents reading and interpretation of eventual startup
files. See section FILES below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--prodvd_cli_compatible <br>
Activates behavior modifications with some DVD situations
which bring cdrskin nearer to the behavior of
cdrecord-ProDVD: <br>
Option -multi with unsuitable media is not an error but
simply has no effect. <br>
Options blank=fast and blank=all deformat overwriteable
DVD-RW media. <br>
Option blank=fast does indeed minmal blanking with DVD-RW.
This may yield media which can only do DAO but not
Incremental Streaming.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--single_track <br>
Accept only the last argument of the command line as track
source address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">stdio_sync=on|off|number <br>
Set the number of bytes after which to force output to
drives with prefix &quot;stdio:&quot;. This forcing keeps
the memory from being clogged with lots of pending data for
slow <br>
devices. Default &quot;on&quot; is the same as
&quot;16m&quot;. Forced output can be disabled by
&quot;off&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">stream_recording=on|off|number
<br>
By setting &quot;on&quot; request that compliance to the
desired speed setting is preferred over management of write
errors. With DVD-RAM and BD this can bring effective write
speed <br>
near to the nominal write speed of the media. But it will
also disable the automatic use of replacement blocks if
write errors occur. It might as well be disliked or <br>
ignored by the drive. <br>
If a number is given, then error management stays enabled
for all byte addresses below that number. Any number below
16s is the same as &quot;off&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tao_to_sao_tsize=size <br>
Set an exact fixed size for the next track to be in effect
only if the track source cannot deliver a size prediction
and no tsize= was specified and an exact track size <br>
prediction is demanded by the write mode. <br>
This was the fallback from bad old times when cdrskin was
unable to burn in mode -tao . It came back with minimally
blanked DVD-RW which allow no Incremental Streaming <br>
(-tao) resp. with explicitly selected write mode -sao for
best DVD-ROM compatibility. <br>
If the track source delivers less bytes than announced then
the missing ones will be filled with zeros.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--tell_media_space <br>
Prepare a recording session, do not perform it but rather
inquire the maximum number of 2048 byte data blocks which
may be written in the current state of media with the <br>
prepared setup. So this option disables recording of data.
It does allow blanking, though, and will measure space
afterwards. <br>
It is not mandatory to give track sources but their nature
may influence the available capacity. So for most realistic
results one may set up the full burn session and add <br>
--tell_media_space. But if one has to expect a cdrskin
version prior to 0.3.3 no track source should be given in
order not to start an involuntary burn session. In this <br>
case set at least -sao or -tao explicitly. <br>
The result gets printed to standard output. It is 0 or empty
if no writing is possible with the given options. This
option redirects to stderr all message output except <br>
its own result string and eventual output of -msinfo.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--two_channel <br>
Indicate for subsequent tracks that they were mastered with
two channels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">write_start_address=byte_offset
<br>
Set the address on media where to start writing the track.
With DVD+RW, DVD-RAM or BD-RE byte_offset must be aligned to
2 kiB blocks, but better is 32 kiB. With DVD-RW 32 <br>
kiB alignment is mandatory. <br>
Other media are not suitable for this option yet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alphabetical list of options
which are only intended for very special situations and not
for normal use:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--abort_handler <br>
Establish default signal handling not to leave a drive in
busy state but rather to shut it down and to wait until it
has ended the final operations. This option is only <br>
needed for revoking eventual --ignore_signals or
--no_abort_handler.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--allow_untested_media <br>
Enable the use of media profiles which have been implemented
but not yet tested. Currently this option is without effect
because no media types are under test reservation. <br>
(If you really test experimental media, then please report
the outcome on libburn-hackers@pykix.org)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--cdtext_dummy <br>
Prepare a burn run, report the effective array of CD-TEXT
packs to stdout, and then end the program run without
starting to burn the session. A blank CD-R or CD-RW has to
<br>
be present in the drive, nevertheless. <br>
The output is formatted in lines which describe 18 bytes as
2-digit hex numbers or as single printable characters. See
libburn document doc/cdtext.txt about the format of <br>
these records.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--cdtext_verbose <br>
Like --cdtext_dummy but without preventing the burn run.
Combinable with option -dummy to exercise a CD burn run with
no persistent impact on the medium.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">dev_translation=&lt;sep&gt;&lt;from&gt;&lt;sep&gt;&lt;to&gt;
<br>
Set drive address alias. This was necessary before
cdrskin-0.2.4 to manually translate cdrecord addresses into
cdrskin addresses. <br>
&lt;sep&gt; is a single character which may not occur in the
address string &lt;from&gt;. &lt;from&gt; is an address as
expected to be given by the user via option dev=. &lt;to&gt;
is the address <br>
to be used instead whenever &lt;from&gt; is given. More than
one translation instruction can be given in one cdrskin run.
<br>
E.g.: dev_translation=+ATA:1,0,0+/dev/sr1
dev_translation=+ATA:1,1,0+/dev/sr2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--drive_abort_on_busy <br>
Linux specific: Abort process if a busy drive is
encountered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--drive_blocking <br>
Linux specific: Try to wait for a busy drive to become free.
This is not guaranteed to work with all drivers. Some need
nonblocking i/o.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--drive_f_setlk <br>
Linux specific: Try to get exclusive lock on drive device
file via fcntl(2).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--drive_not_exclusive <br>
Linux specific: Combine --drive_not_f_setlk and
--drive_not_o_excl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--drive_not_f_setlk <br>
Linux specific: Do not try to get exclusive lock on drive
device file via fcntl(2).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--drive_not_o_excl <br>
Linux specific: Do not ask the operating system to prevent
opening busy drives. Wether this leads to senseful behavior
depends on operating system and kernel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">drive_scsi_dev_family=sr|scd|sg
<br>
Linux specific: Select a SCSI device file family to be
scanned for by options --devices, --device_links and
-scanbus. Normally this is /dev/sgN on kernel versions &lt;
2.6 <br>
and /dev/srN on kernels &gt;= 2.6 . This option allows to
explicitly override that default in order to meet other
programs at a common device file for each drive. On kernel
<br>
2.4 families sr and scd will find no drives. <br>
Device file family /dev/hdX on kernel &gt;= 2.6 is not
affected by this setting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--drive_scsi_exclusive <br>
Linux specific: Try to exclusively reserve device files
/dev/srN, /dev/scdM, /dev/sgK of drives. This would be
helpful to protect against collisions with program
grow&acirc; <br>
isofs. Regrettably on Linux kernel 2.4 with ide-scsi
emulation this seems not to work. Wether it becomes helpful
with new Linux systems has to be evaluated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--fifo_disable <br>
Disable fifo despite any fs=.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--fifo_per_track <br>
Use a separate fifo for each track.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--fill_up_media <br>
Expand the last track of the session to occupy all remaining
free space on the media. <br>
This option overrides option -multi. It will not fill up
media if option -sao is given with CD media. <br>
Caution: With multi-session media this option might increase
readatibility on DVD-ROM drives but with some DVD recorders
and media types it might also fail to produce <br>
readable media at all. &quot;Your mileage may vary&quot;.
<br>
You can expect the best possible read compatibility if you
do not use -multi at all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">grab_drive_and_wait=seconds <br>
Open the addressed drive, wait the given number of seconds,
release the drive, and do normal work as indicated by the
other options used. This option helps to explore the <br>
program behavior when faced with busy drives. Just start a
second cdrskin with option --devices while
grab_drive_and_wait= is still active.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ignore_signals <br>
Try to ignore any signals rather than to abort the program.
This is not a very good idea. You might end up waiting a
very long time for cdrskin to finish.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">modesty_on_drive=&lt;mode&gt;[:min_percent=&lt;num&gt;][:max_percent=&lt;num&gt;]
<br>
Mode 1 keeps the program from trying to write to the burner
drive while its buffer is in danger to be filled by more
than max_percent. If this filling is exceeded then the <br>
program will wait until the filling is at most min_percent.
<br>
This can ease the load on operating system and drive
controller and thus help with achieving better input
bandwidth if disk and burner are not on independent
controllers <br>
(like hda and hdb). Unsufficient input bandwidth is
indicated by output &quot;(fifo xy%)&quot; of option -v if
xy is lower than 90 for some time. modesty_on_drive= might
hamper <br>
output bandwidth and cause buffer underruns. <br>
To have max_percent larger than the burner&rsquo;s best
actual buffer fill has the same effect as
min_percent==max_percent. Some burners do not use their full
buffer with all <br>
media types. Watch output &quot;[buf xy%]&quot; of option -v
to get an impression of the actual buffer usage. Some
burners are not suitable because they report buffer fill
with <br>
granularity too large in size or time. <br>
Mode 0 disables this feature. Mode -1 keeps it unchanged.
Default is: <br>
modesty_on_drive=0:min_percent=65:max_percent=95 <br>
Percentages are permissible in the range of 25 to 100.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no_abort_handler <br>
On signals exit even if the drive is in busy state. This is
not a very good idea. You might end up with a stuck drive
that refuses to hand out the media.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no_blank_appendable <br>
Refuse to blank appendable CD-RW or DVD-RW. This is a
feature that was once builtin with libburn. No information
available for what use case it was needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no_convert_fs_adr <br>
Do only literal translations of dev=. This prevents cdrskin
from test-opening device files in order to find one that
matches the given dev= specifier. <br>
Partly Linux specific: Such opening is needed for
Bus,Target,Lun addresses unless option --old_pseudo_scsi_adr
is given. It is also needed to resolve device file addresses
<br>
which are not listed with cdrskin --devices but nevertheless
point to a usable drive. (Like /dev/sg0 using the same SCSI
address as /dev/sr0.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--obs_pad <br>
Pad the data of last write operation of a DVD-R[W] DAO
session or stdio: pseudo-drive up to the full size of an
output chunk. This padding has to be applied automatically
<br>
to the other DVD and BD media types, where it causes e.g.
ISO images to have trailing unclaimed blocks. <br>
Use this option if there is the suspicion that DAO sessions
abort with your kernel and/or DVD drive, if their size is
not a multiple of 16 blocks. <br>
This option may also get enabled at compile time of
libburn.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--old_pseudo_scsi_adr <br>
Linux specific: Use and report literal Bus,Target,Lun
addresses rather than real SCSI and pseudo ATA addresses.
This method is outdated and was never compatible with
orig&acirc; <br>
inal cdrecord.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sao_postgap=off|number <br>
Define whether a post-gap shall be written at the end of the
track and how many sectors this gap shall have. A post-gap
occupies the range of an additional index of the <br>
track. It contains zeros. No bytes from the track source
will be read for writing the post-gap. <br>
This setting affects only CD SAO write runs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sao_pregap=off|number <br>
Define whether a pre-gap shall be written before the track
and how many sectors this pre-gap shall have. A pre-gap is
written in the range of track index 0 and contains <br>
zeros resp. silence. No bytes from the track source will be
read for writing the pre-gap. <br>
This setting affects only CD SAO write runs. <br>
The first track automatically gets a pre-gap of at least 150
sectors. Its size can only be enlarged by this call.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--xa1-ignore <br>
Silently interpret option -xa1 as -data. This may be
necessary if a frontent does not prepare -xa1 block headers
but insists in using option -xa1.</p>
