  Resources Analysis Support System</a></h1>
GRASS GIS, commonly referred to as GRASS (Geographic Resources Analysis Support
  System), is a free Geographic Information System (GIS) software used for
  geospatial data management and analysis, image processing, graphics/maps
  production, spatial modeling, and visualization. GRASS GIS is currently used
  in academic and commercial settings around the world, as well as by many
  governmental agencies and environmental consulting companies. GRASS GIS is an
  official project of the Open Source Geospatial Foundation (OSGeo).

  Graphical startup of GRASS GIS</a></h1>
<i>For text-based startup see below.</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
After launching GRASS GIS, the startup screen will open:
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Selecting_the_GIS_Database_directory"><a class="selflink" href="#Selecting_the_GIS_Database_directory">Selecting
  the GIS Database directory</a></h2>
GRASS data are stored in a directory referred to as DATABASE (also called
  &quot;GISDBASE&quot;). This directory has to be created with a file manager or
  the mkdir command, before starting to work with GRASS. Within this DATABASE,
  the projects are organized by project areas stored in subdirectories called
  LOCATIONs.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Selecting_the_LOCATION_(a_project)"><a class="selflink" href="#Selecting_the_LOCATION_(a_project)">Selecting
  the LOCATION (a project)</a></h2>
A LOCATION is defined by its coordinate system, map projection and geographical
  boundaries. The subdirectories and files defining a LOCATION are created
  automatically when GRASS is started the first time with a new LOCATION. It is
  important to understand that each projection stays in its own LOCATION.
<div class="Pp"></div>
See the &quot;Location Wizard&quot; to easily create a new LOCATION from scratch
  from a geocoded file, by defining the parameters or by selecting the
  corresponding EPSG projection code.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Selecting_the_MAPSET_(a_subproject)"><a class="selflink" href="#Selecting_the_MAPSET_(a_subproject)">Selecting
  the MAPSET (a subproject)</a></h2>
Each LOCATION can have many MAPSETs. Each MAPSET is a LOCATION&#x2019;s
  subdirectory. New MAPSET can be added at GRASS startup (see related button).
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Location_Wizard"><a class="selflink" href="#Location_Wizard">Location
  Wizard</a></h2>
The &quot;Location Wizard&quot; let&#x2019;s you easily create a new LOCATION.
  You will be guided through a series of dialogues to browse and select
  predefined projections (also via EPSG code) or to define individual
  projections. You can also create new LOCATION easily from a georeferenced data
  file (e.g., SHAPE file or GeoTIFF, see below). Find below also some rules to
  define the default raster resolution for a new LOCATION.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Start_GRASS"><a class="selflink" href="#Start_GRASS">Start
  GRASS</a></h2>
Once you have selected an existing LOCATION/MAPSET or defined a new one, you can
  enter GRASS. The graphical user interface wxGUI will open and provide you with
  a menu system, map visualization tool, digitizer, and more.

  Background: GRASS GIS Location structure</a></h1>
A LOCATION is simply a set of directories which contains the GRASS data of a
  project. Within each LOCATION, a mandatory &quot;PERMANENT&quot; MAPSET exists
  which contains projection information and some more definitions. It can be
  used to store the base cartography in it as &quot;PERMANENT&quot; is visible
  to all users accessing a LOCATION.
<div class="Pp"></div>

<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Creating_and_maintaining_MAPSETs"><a class="selflink" href="#Creating_and_maintaining_MAPSETs">Creating
  and maintaining MAPSETs</a></h2>
One motivation to maintain different MAPSETs is to store maps related to project
  issues or subregions. Another motivation is to support simultaneous access of
  several users to the map layers stored within the same LOCATION, i.e. teams
  working on the same project. For teams, a centralized GRASS DATABASE would be
  defined in a shared network file system (e.g. NFS). Besides access to his/her
  own MAPSET, each user can also read map layers in other users&#x2019; MAPSETs,
  but s/he can modify or remove only the map layers in his/her own MAPSET.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can learn more about mapsets and how to seamlessly access maps found in
  another MAPSET of the same LOCATION in the g.mapsets documentation.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="The_role_of_the_&quot;PERMANENT&quot;_MAPSET"><a class="selflink" href="#The_role_of_the_&quot;PERMANENT&quot;_MAPSET">The
  role of the &quot;PERMANENT&quot; MAPSET</a></h2>
When creating a new LOCATION, GRASS GIS automatically creates a special MAPSET
  called PERMANENT where the core data for the project can be stored. Data in
  the PERMANENT MAPSET can only be added, modified or removed by the owner of
  the PERMANENT MAPSET; however, they can be accessed, analyzed, and copied into
  their own MAPSET by the other users. The PERMANENT MAPSET is useful for
  providing general spatial data (e.g. an elevation model), accessible but
  write-protected to all users who are working in the same LOCATION as the
  database owner. To manipulate or add data to PERMANENT, the owner would start
  GRASS and choose the relevant LOCATION and the PERMANENT MAPSET. This mapset
  also contains the DEFAULT_WIND file, which holds the default region boundary
  coordinate values for the LOCATION (which all users will inherit when they
  start using the database). Additionally, in all mapsets a WIND file is kept,
  for storing the current boundary coordinate values and the currently selected
  raster resolution. Users have the option of switching back to the default
  region at any time.

  Creating a GRASS Database with Sample Data</a></h1>
To create the GRASS database:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>1</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Find a place on your disk where you have write access and
      that has enough disk space to hold your spatial data.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>2</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Create a subdirectory that will hold the general GRASS
      database (e.g. using a file manager or with mkdir /data/grassdata or mkdir
      /home/yourlogin/grassdata).</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Sample data such as the &quot;North Carolina&quot; or the &quot;Spearfish&quot;
  sample datasets may be downloaded from
  http://grass.osgeo.org/download/sample-data/ and the compressed data
  package(s) extracted into this new database directory.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Now you are ready to select a sample dataset in the GRASS GIS startup screen
  (see above) and start the session.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="4._Creating_a_New_Location_with_the_Location_Wizard"><a class="selflink" href="#4._Creating_a_New_Location_with_the_Location_Wizard">4.
  Creating a New Location with the Location Wizard</a></h1>
The wxGUI graphical user interface provides a graphical &quot;Location
  Wizard&quot; which lets you easily create a new LOCATION for own data. You
  will be guided through a series of dialogues to browse and select predefined
  projections (also via EPSG code) or to define individual projections. The
  rules to define the resolution as described above also apply here.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Hint: You can create new LOCATION easily from a georeferenced data file</i>
  <i>(e.g., SHAPE file or GeoTIFF file with the related metadata properly
  included).</i> <i>In this case you are asked whether the data itself should be
  imported</i> <i>into the new LOCATION. The default region is then set to match
  imported map</i> <i>and the GRASS GIS session is opened.</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
After defining new LOCATION, wxGUI starts automatically. If data were already
  imported, you can add them into the Layer Manager now and display them. If
  your LOCATION is empty you can import your data from the menu: Go to
  &quot;File&quot; -&gt; &quot;Import raster/vector data&quot; (see also the
  related Wiki page on Importing data).

GRASS GIS can be run entirely without using the graphical user interface. For a
  first time startup, the following steps have to be followed:

      PERMANENT mapset, without entering the new location:</dd>
