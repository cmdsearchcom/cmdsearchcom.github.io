<p style="margin-top: 1em">GRASS GIS Quickstart Geographic
Resources Analysis Support System <br>
GRASS GIS, commonly referred to as GRASS (Geographic
Resources Analysis Support System), is a free Geographic
Information System (GIS) software used for geospatial data
manage&acirc; <br>
ment and analysis, image processing, graphics/maps
production, spatial modeling, and visualization. GRASS GIS
is currently used in academic and commercial settings around
the <br>
world, as well as by many governmental agencies and
environmental consulting companies. GRASS GIS is an official
project of the Open Source Geospatial Foundation
(OSGeo).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. Graphical startup of GRASS
GIS <br>
For text-based startup see below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After launching GRASS GIS, the
startup screen will open:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Selecting the GIS Database
directory <br>
GRASS data are stored in a directory referred to as DATABASE
(also called &quot;GISDBASE&quot;). This directory has to be
created with a file manager or the mkdir command, before
starting <br>
to work with GRASS. Within this DATABASE, the projects are
organized by project areas stored in subdirectories called
LOCATIONs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Selecting the LOCATION (a
project) <br>
A LOCATION is defined by its coordinate system, map
projection and geographical boundaries. The subdirectories
and files defining a LOCATION are created automatically when
GRASS <br>
is started the first time with a new LOCATION. It is
important to understand that each projection stays in its
own LOCATION.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See the &quot;Location
Wizard&quot; to easily create a new LOCATION from scratch
from a geocoded file, by defining the parameters or by
selecting the corresponding EPSG projection code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Selecting the MAPSET (a
subproject) <br>
Each LOCATION can have many MAPSETs. Each MAPSET is a
LOCATION&acirc;s subdirectory. New MAPSET can be added at
GRASS startup (see related button).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Location Wizard <br>
The &quot;Location Wizard&quot; let&acirc;s you easily
create a new LOCATION. You will be guided through a series
of dialogues to browse and select predefined projections
(also via EPSG code) or <br>
to define individual projections. You can also create new
LOCATION easily from a georeferenced data file (e.g., SHAPE
file or GeoTIFF, see below). Find below also some rules to
<br>
define the default raster resolution for a new LOCATION.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Start GRASS <br>
Once you have selected an existing LOCATION/MAPSET or
defined a new one, you can enter GRASS. The graphical user
interface wxGUI will open and provide you with a menu
system, map <br>
visualization tool, digitizer, and more.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Background: GRASS GIS
Location structure <br>
A LOCATION is simply a set of directories which contains the
GRASS data of a project. Within each LOCATION, a mandatory
&quot;PERMANENT&quot; MAPSET exists which contains
projection infor&acirc; <br>
mation and some more definitions. It can be used to store
the base cartography in it as &quot;PERMANENT&quot; is
visible to all users accessing a LOCATION.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fig. 1: GRASS GIS 7 location
structure</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Creating and maintaining MAPSETs
<br>
One motivation to maintain different MAPSETs is to store
maps related to project issues or subregions. Another
motivation is to support simultaneous access of several
users to <br>
the map layers stored within the same LOCATION, i.e. teams
working on the same project. For teams, a centralized GRASS
DATABASE would be defined in a shared network file system
<br>
(e.g. NFS). Besides access to his/her own MAPSET, each user
can also read map layers in other users&acirc; MAPSETs, but
s/he can modify or remove only the map layers in his/her own
<br>
MAPSET.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can learn more about mapsets
and how to seamlessly access maps found in another MAPSET of
the same LOCATION in the g.mapsets documentation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The role of the
&quot;PERMANENT&quot; MAPSET <br>
When creating a new LOCATION, GRASS GIS automatically
creates a special MAPSET called PERMANENT where the core
data for the project can be stored. Data in the PERMANENT
MAPSET <br>
can only be added, modified or removed by the owner of the
PERMANENT MAPSET; however, they can be accessed, analyzed,
and copied into their own MAPSET by the other users. The
<br>
PERMANENT MAPSET is useful for providing general spatial
data (e.g. an elevation model), accessible but
write-protected to all users who are working in the same
LOCATION as the <br>
database owner. To manipulate or add data to PERMANENT, the
owner would start GRASS and choose the relevant LOCATION and
the PERMANENT MAPSET. This mapset also contains the <br>
DEFAULT_WIND file, which holds the default region boundary
coordinate values for the LOCATION (which all users will
inherit when they start using the database). Additionally,
in <br>
all mapsets a WIND file is kept, for storing the current
boundary coordinate values and the currently selected raster
resolution. Users have the option of switching back to the
<br>
default region at any time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. Creating a GRASS Database
with Sample Data <br>
To create the GRASS database:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 Find a place on your disk
where you have write access and that has enough disk space
to hold your spatial data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 Create a subdirectory that
will hold the general GRASS database (e.g. using a file
manager or with mkdir /data/grassdata or mkdir
/home/yourlogin/grassdata).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sample data such as the
&quot;North Carolina&quot; or the &quot;Spearfish&quot;
sample datasets may be downloaded from
http://grass.osgeo.org/download/sample-data/ and the
compressed data package(s) <br>
extracted into this new database directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Now you are ready to select a
sample dataset in the GRASS GIS startup screen (see above)
and start the session.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. Creating a New Location with
the Location Wizard <br>
The wxGUI graphical user interface provides a graphical
&quot;Location Wizard&quot; which lets you easily create a
new LOCATION for own data. You will be guided through a
series of dia&acirc; <br>
logues to browse and select predefined projections (also via
EPSG code) or to define individual projections. The rules to
define the resolution as described above also apply <br>
here.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hint: You can create new
LOCATION easily from a georeferenced data file (e.g., SHAPE
file or GeoTIFF file with the related metadata properly
included). In this case you are <br>
asked whether the data itself should be imported into the
new LOCATION. The default region is then set to match
imported map and the GRASS GIS session is opened.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After defining new LOCATION,
wxGUI starts automatically. If data were already imported,
you can add them into the Layer Manager now and display
them. If your LOCATION is empty <br>
you can import your data from the menu: Go to
&quot;File&quot; -&gt; &quot;Import raster/vector data&quot;
(see also the related Wiki page on Importing data).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5. Text-based startup and
location creation <br>
GRASS GIS can be run entirely without using the graphical
user interface. For a first time startup, the following
steps have to be followed:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 Create a GRASS GIS database as
explained above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 Create a new location,
including it&acirc;s default PERMANENT mapset, without
entering the new location:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Using an EPSG
code: <br>
grass72 -e -c EPSG:32630 /home/user/grassdata/mylocation</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Using a
georeferenced raster or vector file: <br>
grass72 -e -c MyGeoReferenceFile.tif
/home/user/grassdata/mylocation</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3 Create new mapset within the
new location and launch GRASS GIS within that mapset: <br>
grass72 -c /home/user/grassdata/mylocation/mymapset</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Further Reading <br>

and books: http://grass.osgeo.org/documentation/.</p>
