DH_CONFIGPACKAGE(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
dh_configpackage - add maintainer script rules to displace,
hide, or transform files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
dh_configpackage [--displace path] [--hide path]
[--undisplace path] [--unhide file] [--transform
transformation] [debhelper options] [-n]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
dh_configpackage is a debhelper program to create
&quot;configuration packages&quot;. These packages provide
an ideal way to distribute configurations to target systems
while still <br>
affording local system administrators a degree of control
over their workstations. The motivation and philosophy
behind this style of packaging is described in detail on the
<br>
config-package-dev website. Configuration packages make use
of dpkg diversions and maintainer script snippets to provide
three primary operations: displacing, hiding, and <br>
transforming files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The displace operation consists
of replacing a file on the target system. The original file
is renamed out of the way and diverted in the dpkg database.
The replacement file is <br>
then installed by the package, and the config-package-dev
maintainer script snippets create a symlink from the
original name. A common use of this is to install a wrapper
script <br>
for an executable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The transform operation is a
special case of the displace operation. At build time, a
&quot;transform script&quot; is applied to the original
source, and the result is used as the <br>
replacement in the displace operation. A common use of this
is to change one value in a config file without needing to
re-type the entire config file (and risk bit-rot).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The hide operation is yet
another special case of the displace operation, namely that
there is no replacement or symlink. Instead, the file is
diverted to a unique path on the <br>
target system, thus preserving its contents. A common use of
this is to suppress a snippet file in a configuration
directory (e.g. /etc/foo.d), thus disabling a specific <br>
operation or configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The displace extension is a
suffix appended to the diverted versions of files, and this
suffix plus the string &quot;-orig&quot; is appended to the
original versions of the files. The <br>
default value is the first word of the package name. For
example, the extension for debathena-bin-example would be
&quot;.debathena&quot;. So if debathena-bin-example
displaced <br>
/bin/true, the original /bin/true would be found at
/bin/true.debathena-orig and the new version (installed by
e.g. dh_install) found at /bin/true.debathena. /bin/true
itself <br>
would become a symbolic link. (For the remainder of this
documentation, &quot;.debathena&quot; will be used as the
displace extension.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
debian/package.displace <br>
List the files to displace, one per line, including the full
path and displace extension. For example, to displace
/usr/bin/true to /usr/bin/true.debathena, you would list
<br>
&quot;/usr/bin/true.debathena&quot; in the file. (As with
other Debhelper commands, you can omit the initial leading
slash in pathnames in the package, but these examples retain
it.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">debian/package.hide <br>
List the files to hide, one per line, including the full
path and displace extension. As noted above, these files
won&rsquo;t actually be removed, but merely diverted and
renamed <br>
to a unique path below /usr/share/package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">debian/package.undisplace <br>
List the files to undisplace, one per line, including the
full path and displace extension. NOTE: This is only needed
when a new version of the package no longer needs to <br>
displace a file (for example, if an upstream bug was fixed).
Packages automatically undo all operations upon removal or
deconfiguration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">debian/package.unhide <br>
List the files to unhide, one per line, including the full
path and displace extension. NOTE: As with undisplace, this
is only needed when a new version of the package no <br>
longer needs to hide a file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">debian/package.transform <br>
Each line in the file specifies a transformation. A
transformation consists of two space-separated fields: the
full path of the target file including the displace
extension <br>
and the transformation command itself. The transformation
can either be a single shell command, or an executable file
in the debian directory. The transformation takes the <br>
original source of the file on stdin and prints its
transformation on stdout. Transformations are typically
performed by perl, sed, or awk, but there is no limitation
on <br>
what can be used as a transformation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, to transform
/etc/school.conf by replacing all occurrences of the word
&rsquo;Harvard&rsquo; with the word &rsquo;MIT&rsquo;, you
might specify the following line:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/school.conf.debathena sed
-e &rsquo;s/Harvard/MIT/g&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Or, storing the command in a
separate script:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/school.conf.debathena
debian/transform_school.conf.pl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the transformation script
fails, the package build fails. You can use this with e.g.
Perl&rsquo;s &quot;or die&quot; syntax to make sure that the
source file of the transformation has not <br>
changed from what you expected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Transformation sources: Under
normal operation, the source (passed on stdin) for the
transformation is the name of the diversion without the
divert extension. In some cases, <br>
you may wish to use a different source (e.g. a sample
configuration file in /usr/share/doc). You can specify this
source as an optional field between the diversion filename
<br>
and the transformation. This field must begin with a
&rsquo;&lt;&rsquo; immediately followed by the full path to
the source. Taking the example above, we might alter it as
follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/school.conf.debathena
&lt;/usr/share/doc/school/conf.example sed -e
&rsquo;s/Harvard/MIT/g&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: There is no
&quot;untransform&quot; operation. Because a transform
operation is a special case of a displace operation, the
&quot;undisplace&quot; operation is the correct way of
removing <br>
a no-longer-needed transformation in future versions of the
package.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">debian/package.displace-extension
<br>
This file is used to specify the displace extension for any
files diverted by this package, if you do not want to accept
the default of the first word in the package name. <br>
It will not normally be present. (See
&quot;CAVEATS&quot;.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-n, --noscripts <br>
Do not modify maintainer scripts. This is a standard
debhelper option, though you are strongly discouraged from
using it except for debugging, as these operations rely <br>
heavily on the maintainer scripts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--displace path <br>
--hide path <br>
--undisplace path <br>
--unhide path <br>
--transform transformation <br>
These options allow for specifying an operation on the
command line. The argument to the option is the same as a
single line of the corresponding file, as described above.
<br>
You may specify multiple occurrences of --displace, or you
may invoke dh_configpackage repeatedly with different
invocations. The most common use of this format is in a <br>
rules file when performing conditional operations, in an
&quot;override_dh_configpackage&quot; target in the
&quot;rules&quot; file. See the
debathena-conffile-example-1.1 package in <br>
/usr/share/doc/config-package-dev/EXAMPLES for one such
use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CAVEATS <br>
Because the displace extension is automatically generated
from the package name, renaming the package can have
unintended consequences. If you must rename a package such
that <br>
the first component of the name changes, specify the old
extension using the &quot;displace-extension&quot; file (see
above).</p>
