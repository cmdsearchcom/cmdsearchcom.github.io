<p style="margin-top: 1em">BRIEF EXPLANATION <br>
True solar year, also known as tropical year, was a still
later discovery. One has to take equinox or solstice into
account to keep an accurate track of the solar year. The
<br>
equinoxes are the two intersections of the sun&rsquo;s
apparent annual path with the celestial equator. The sun
reaches the vernal equinox on 1st of Farvardin, on or about
21st March, <br>
the summer solstice on 1st of Tir, on about 22nd June, the
autumnal equinox on 1st Mehr, on or about 23rd September,
and the winter solstice on 1st of Dey, on or about 22
December. <br>
Because the two planes, the path of the sun and the
celestial equator move in opposite directions, the equinoxes
and solstices do not occur at the same points every year.
This <br>
anti-clock movement of the intersection point is called
precession. It moves one degree in 72 years, one Zodiac sign
of 30 degrees in 2,156 years and one circle in 25,868 years.
<br>
For further information on calendar, solar or tropical year,
precession, and other astronomical data, refer to any good
encyclopedia or a publication on astronomy and astrology.
<br>
The tropical year, based on the four seasons, is precise. It
is 365.24224 solar days (365 days 5 hr 48 min 45.5 sec), and
the tropical lunar year is 354.36708 solar days, a
differ&acirc; <br>
ence of 10.87516 solar days. We need not go far to find a
workable calendar. Of all the present calendars, the
official Iranian calendar, based on the astronomical system,
is the <br>
most scientific calendar in use and bears the names of what
are known as Zoroastrian months. It rightly has the vernal
equinox (on or about 21st March) at the beginning of the
<br>
spring and the year. The fourth month begins on the summer
solstice (on or about 22 June), the seventh month on the
autumnal equinox (on or about 23 September), and the ninth
month <br>
on the winter solstice (on or about 22 December). In the
true seasonal year, the first half contains 186 days and the
second half about 179.242 days. This means that the first
six <br>
months are of 31 days each, the following five months of 30
days each, and the last month of 29 days, but which
automatically becomes of 30 days in the so-called
&quot;leap&quot; year. The <br>
four seasons begin on the first days of the seasonal
quarters. This is exactly what the Iranian calendar follows:
The first six months are of 31 days each, the next five
months of <br>
30 days each and the last month is of 29 days but of 30 days
in the leap year. Reports indicate that the Central Asian
republics may follow suit. Historical evidence that the five
<br>
Gatha days were added at the end of summer proves that the
early &quot;Zoroastrian&quot; calendar had this fact in
view.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THE INDO-IRANIAN CALENDAR <br>
Evidences from the Avesta and the Vedas show that the
Indo-Iranians, like many other people, followed a lunisolar
year for their animal husbandry and agricultural purpose.
The <br>
names of the six Gaahaanbaars, six parts of the Vedic year
and the Achaemenian months, as seen below, show that the
calendar was based on various seasonal phases of the year.
The <br>
Gathas speak of the paths of the sun and the stars, and
speaks about the waxing and waning phases of the moon, a
sure sign of an accurate lunisolar year. The language used
is <br>
astronomical, and it confirms the reports written in ancient
Middle Eastern and Mediterranean writings that Zarathushtra
was an outstanding astronomer also. It also confirms the
<br>
statement in post-Sassanian Iranian astronomy books that
Zarathushtra built an observatory in Zabol, Sistan (eastern
Iran) and that it was inaugurated on 21st March 1725 BCE,
the <br>
day King Vishtaspa and his courtiers converted, chose the
Good Religion and joined the Zarathushtrian Fellowship. It
also provides us with the clue that the Good Religion was
<br>
founded by Zarathushtra, exactly twelve years earlier on
vernal equinox of 1737 BCE. The Vispered, dedicated only to
the six seasonal festivals, the &quot;Gaahaanbaars&quot;,
also shows <br>
that the early Zarathushtrian calendar was almost the old
Indo-Iranian lunisolar calendar with its waxing and waning
lunar phases. The month was based on moon&rsquo;s phases,
and the <br>
year was calculated on the solar basis. The difference was
corrected by an intercalation of eleven days at the end of
the year on the Hamaspathmaidhaya Gahanbar of the vernal
<br>
equinox. This was 0.12484 day or 2.99616 hours shorter. Only
a further intercalation of one day after eight years
(precisely after 8.010253 years), could keep the seasonal
festi&acirc; <br>
vals in their proper places. How did the Gathic people
correct it, we do not know. We know this much that no
complaint has been recorded by them about the festivals
drifting away <br>
from their relevant agricultural seasons. Sometime during
the later Avestan age, the year was made into a purely solar
year of 365 days with twelve months of thirty days and the
<br>
five &quot;Gatha&quot; days as the intercalary period.
Should we believe a 9th century Pahlavi tradition, the
correction of five hours and a fraction was made good every
four years, or the <br>
community had to wait for 40 years to intercalate 10 days or
still more for 120 years to add a thirteenth month of 30
days. The usual reference to one month intercalation at the
<br>
end of 120 years only reminds us of the disorder that
prevailed during the last days of the Sassanian Empire and
its subsequent fall.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THE LEAP YEAR <br>
A point about intercalation in a
&lsquo;&lsquo;leap&rsquo;&rsquo; year: The precise time of
vernal equinox is determined by the International Meridian,
at present Greenwich. The usual way is to count the <br>
year of 365 days and 6 hours. Four 6 hours, or one day, is
added to bring back the year on the right track. This fourth
year is called the &lsquo;&lsquo;leap year&rsquo;&rsquo;
because it leaps one day <br>
ahead. But the actual length of the year is 6 hours but 5
hours 48 minutes and 45.5 seconds, a difference of 11
minutes and 14.5 seconds. This amount to one day in 128
days. It <br>
was to correct this that the leap years are those eras which
are divisible by 400. Even this makes the Christian or
Common year 26 seconds longer than the tropical year. The
Ira&acirc; <br>
nian calendar does not have this problem. Its new year
begins exactly at the beginning of the equinox. Although the
formal Iranian year of the present days has its leap year,
it <br>
should never worry about it. All it has to do is to see that
if the right times falls after midnight 0 hours 00 minutes
and 01 seconds to 0 hours 00 minutes and 00 seconds -- the
<br>
first day of the year also begins with it. This is because
the Avestan day begins with the &lsquo;&lsquo;Ushahin
Gaah,&rsquo;&rsquo; the Dawn Time, which begins from
midnight. Yes, the Iranians have been <br>
counting their day from midnight for, at least, 3738 years
and it is the West that has adopted it very late in our
times. The Iranian calendar DOES NOT need a leap year at
all. It <br>
is automatically within the right time. I hope that one day
the authorities concerned would realize this FACT and amend
the calendar by eliminating the so-called leap year.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CALENDAR NAMES <br>
Each of the twelve Avestan months and thirty days were named
after a deity, some of them old Aryan gods and goddesses
discarded by Zarathushtra but reintroduced later by
authorita&acirc; <br>
tive priests, and some of them Gathic principles personified
by the same priests into divine entities, all now called
yazatas, meaning &quot;venerated, venerable.&quot;
&quot;Year&quot; in general <br>
was called &quot;yaairi&quot; or &quot;yaari&quot;, but the
intercalated solar year was known as &quot;saredha&quot;,
Old Persian of the Achaemenians &quot;tharda&quot;, and
Pahlavi and modern Persian &quot;saal&quot; (compared <br>
Sanskrit &quot;sharad&quot;, autumn, year). This calendar is
followed to this day by Iranian Zartoshtis and some Parsis.
It is called Fasli, a modern Persian-Arabic word meaning
&quot;seasonal&quot; <br>
However, majority of Parsis use Shahenshahi, the
&quot;Imperial&quot; calendar. The Parsis have not
intercalated since 1126 CE. It now begins in the last week
of August 21st, full seven <br>
months plus one day earlier. The Iranian Zoroastrians, who
follow the Qadimi Calendar, have abandoned intercalation
since 1006 CE and the 365-day year has now forwarded their
new <br>
year day by eight months. As seen, the two calendars are
neither precisely &quot;Gathic&quot; nor astronomically
scientific. So is the present Zoroastrian era of 1370
followed by the Shahen&acirc; <br>
shahis, Qadimis and Parsi Faslis. It is based on the
ascension of the last Sassanian king Yazdegerd III (632-642
CE + 10 years of wandering until his murder by Khosrow the
miller) <br>
and has no religious significance at all. Fortunately, with
the exception of a minute number, mostly residing in India,
all Iranian Zoroastrians have given up the Qadimi calendar
<br>
in favor of the Fasli one, and they reckon the
Zarathushtrian Religious Era as the beginning. At present
there is a move to unify all Zoroastrians, at least in North
America and <br>
Europe, to adopt the Fasli calendar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAMES OF SEASONAL TIMINGS <br>
The Gaahaanbaars: The agricultural people were in tune with
nature in their day-to-day life. They fully knew the solar
and lunar movements and the changes in the seasons. They had
<br>
timed their activities to suit the climate in which they
lived. This timetable was kept in step with saredha, the
tropical solar year of 365 days, 5 hr, 48 min, and 45.5 sec,
but <br>
differed a little on certain points. Their activities were
scheduled to correspond with various phases of their
agricultural life on the Iranian Plateau. It was divided
into six <br>
phases. The end of one phase and the beginning of other were
celebrated as a special time of festivity. The six seasonal
festivals were: (1) Hamaspathmaidhaya, meaning &quot;vernal
<br>
equinox,&quot; the 1st day of Farvardin, the beginning of
spring, on or about 21st March, was to celebrate the end of
the old year and the beginning of the new year. It was,
according <br>
to the Avesta, the time to &quot;properly set&quot;
everything and prepare for the new year. (2)
Maidhyoi-zaremaya (Mid-spring), 14th day of Ardibehesht, on
or about 4th May, was the time <br>
to celebrate the occasion for the cattle having delivered
their young and yielded &quot;abundance of milk&quot; and
also for appraising the crops sown in late winter or early
spring. (3) <br>
Maidhyoi-shema (Midsummer), 12th day of Tir, on or about 3rd
July, was the beginning of the harvesting season. (4)
Paitish-hahya (Grain-reaping), 25th day of Shahrivar, on or
<br>
about 16th September, marked the end of harvesting. (5)
Ayaathrema (no-travel), 24th day of Mehr, on or about 16th
October, was to enjoy the end of trade caravans and the time
to <br>
mate cattle before the winter set in. (6) Maidhyaairya
(Midyear), 15th day of Dey, on or about 4th January,
heralded the passing of the winter peak and for making
preparations to <br>
meet the spring with agricultural activity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Only the first two festivals
coincided with the solar seasonal changes. The others were
purposely put off to meet the living conditions. They were
not calendarically or tradition&acirc; <br>
ally bound but were very practical people, a point to note.
Most probably the festivals were celebrated with sacrifices
to gods and goddesses and by indulging in a joyous
festiv&acirc; <br>
ity. Gahanbars and Zarathushtrians: Asho Zarathushtra, born
in an agricultural environment, preached and spread his Good
Religion among people engaged in crop cultivation and
ani&acirc; <br>
mal husbandry. His dynamic message introduced a completely
new order in spiritual, or better, as he put it, mental
sphere and purged out all evil and superstitious thoughts,
mis&acirc; <br>
leading words, harmful deeds, and superficial, superfluous
rituals, but helped to strengthen and promote all the
then-existing constructive activities of a good living. And
the <br>
Gahanbars were one of the constructively enjoyable
festivals.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Chanting and Feasting: <br>
Avestan evidences, particularly the book of Vispered, show
that the early Zarathushtrians turned the Gahanbar into an
occasion to fit into their new pattern of life. Each
festival <br>
was traditionally celebrated for one and later for five
days. They were devoted to reciting, chanting, explaining,
understanding, and holding questions-and-answers on each of
the <br>
five Gathas of Asho Zarathushtra. The festival was rounded
up with a feast prepared by collective participation and
efforts, and merrymaking. A piece in the Avesta directs that
<br>
all participants should bring whatever they can afford;
dairy products, meat, vegetables, legumes, grain, other food
ingredients, and firewood. If one was not in a position to
<br>
contribute in kind, one might put his or her labor in
preparing the food in a common pot, or just join the
prayers. The food, with a large variety of ingredients, was
a tasty stew, <br>
resembling today&rsquo;s more sophisticated Iranian
&quot;aash&quot; or the Parsi spiced &quot;dhansaak&quot;,
both relished on the occasion. Merrymaking was the folk
music and dances still observed among <br>
Iranian tribes all over the Iranian Plateau and beyond. The
Zarathushtrian Assembly celebrates the Gahanbars with a
relevant Gahanbar prayer, Gatha recital and explanation, a
<br>
brief talk on an interesting subject, potluck lunch,
friendly conversation, and music and dance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Vedic Calendar: <br>
It may be noted that the Indo-Aryans had also six seasons
(Sanskrit rtu, Avestan ratu) evidently modified to meet the
climate in the Indus Valley. They were: Vasanta (Spring),
<br>
Grishma (Summer), Varsha (The Rains), Sharad (Autumn),
Hemanta (Winter), and Shishira (the Cool season). Persians
and Other Iranian Calendar: The Achaemenians, Sogdians,
Chorasmi&acirc; <br>
ans, and Armenians, all Zoroastrians by faith, had their own
names for their months. The names of the Achaemenian months,
as given in the bas-reliefs of Darius the Great are
ren&acirc; <br>
dered to convey (1) Irrigation-canal-cleaning month, (2)
Vigorous spring, (3) Garlic-collecting month, (4) Hot-step,
(7) God-veneration, (8) Wolf-birth, (9) Fire-veneration,
(10) <br>
Anaamaka -- Nameless month, and (12) Digging-up. Three names
have not been given in Old Persian but we have their Elamite
pronunciations and all, except two, are nonreligious <br>
terms. The Achaemenians had numbers instead of names for the
days of the month. (see Old Persian, Ronald G. Kent, 2nd
ed., New Haven, 1953). That confirms that the months as well
<br>
as the days named after pre-Zarathushtrian deities and
post-Zarathushtrian personifications of Gathic abstracts is
a later addition. There are indications that it was done
during <br>
the reign of Artaxerxes II (405-359 BCE), and that naming
the months and days in honor of deities were adopted from
the Egyptians. The names of the Gahanbars, and those of the
<br>
Vedic, Achaemenian, Sogdian, Chorasmian, and Armenian months
show that the names of the pre-Zarathushtrian and Gathic
months must have been based on the seasons and social
activi&acirc; <br>
ties, and not on deities. These old names have, however,
been so well obliterated by the authoritarian priests that
we do not have any inkling of what they were.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Later Avestan Calendar: <br>

the symbol of the Progressive Mentality <br>
(Spenta Mainyu), and &quot;ap&quot; (water) is also
mentioned in the Gathic texts, but the rest are later
Avestan names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THE WEEK <br>
The early Avestan people had no notion of the week, a period
of seven days now in universal use as a division of time.
Week is a man-made unit. Its length has, among various
peo&acirc; <br>
ple, been from five to ten days. But since the lunar month,
one of the earliest ways of reckoning time, is alternately
of 29 and 30 days with two phases of waxing and waning moon,
<br>
it was quite easy to further divide it and have four
quarters of seven and eight days accommodated in it. The
seven planets visible to the naked eye may have also played
a part in <br>
its formation. That is why weekdays are named after
celestial bodies. However, the present universal week is
most probably of Chaldean or Hebrew origin, and has been
generalized by <br>
Jewish, Christian and Islamic persuasion. The later Avestan
solar calendar, based on thirty days in a month, has four
quarters -- the first two of seven days and the last two of
<br>
eight days. But Avesta and Pahlavi do not have any names for
each of these quarters or for the weekdays. Modern Persian
follows the Hebrew pattern of having Saturday as Shanbeh,
<br>
Persianized form of &quot;Shabbath&quot;, and then counting
from one to five as Yek-shanbeh, Do-shanbeh, Se-shanbeh,
Chahaar-shanbeh, Panj-shanbeh, and under the Islamic
influence, Aadineh <br>
or Jom&rsquo;eh for Friday, the day of mass prayers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ERAS <br>
Pahlavi writings tell us that the religious era began from
the day Zarathushtra proclaimed his Divine Mission to
humanity. This era, based on the astronomical calculations
that <br>
Zarathushtra declared his mission on the vernal equinox
when, according to the precession, the period of Aries is
supposed to have begun, comes to be 3738/39 in 2001 CE i.e.
1737 <br>
BCE. It has been called the &quot;Year of Religion&quot; in
Pahlavi writings. The Zarathushtrian Assembly calls it the
Zarathushtrian Religious Era (Z.E.R./ZRE) and has, since its
establish&acirc; <br>
ment in 1990, observed it as the beginning of the
Zarathushtrian calendar. The Zartoshti community in Iran
joined in to observe ZRE as its calendar in 1993, and many
Irani <br>
Zartoshtis in diaspora have also accepted it. Earlier, each
of the Iranian kings, following the pattern set by other
Middle Eastern rulers, particularly the Babylonians,
observed <br>
a new era from his own ascension to the throne. With as many
as 80 rulers on the Iranian throne during the thousand and
odd years of Achaemenians, Macedonians, Parthians, and
Sas&acirc; <br>
sanians, much confusion in chronology has arisen, and many
dates have been misinformed, misused, misplaced,
misinterpreted, miscalculated, and missed. The Yazdgerdi era
reminds <br>
one of the last Emperor who got overthrown by Arab invaders.
It is not a happy recollection. Sassanians and Two
Calendars: The Sassanians continued to maintain both the
&quot;yaairi&quot; <br>
of 365 days and the &quot;saredha&quot; of 365.24224 days.
The first they called &quot;oshmurdik&quot; meaning
&quot;rememberable, reckonable&quot; and the second
&quot;vihezakik&quot; meaning &quot;moving, progressive,
<br>
intercalary.&quot; While the &quot;rememberable&quot; was
easy for the laity to memorize and count them by names, the
&quot;intercalary&quot; belonged to the astronomer priests,
linked with the imperial <br>
court, to keep the formal year precise and in tune with the
seasons. The fall of the Sassanian Empire fell the
astronomer priests of their high position. Nevertheless, the
inter&acirc; <br>
calary year was, Pahlavi books and the present position of
the Qadimi and Shahenshahi calendars tell, kept until the
11th century CE. The decline of astronomer priests put an
end <br>
to Vihezakik and the lay priests have continued with their
&quot;Ushmordik,&quot; advancing about one day in every four
years out of the season and the solar year. Economic and
seasonal <br>
revenue collection, however, forced the Muslim Caliphs to
maintain, evidently by those astronomer priests who had
embraced Islam, the intercalary year in addition to the
Islamic <br>
calendar of a purely lunar year. It was this Vihezakik year
maintained halfheartedly by Muslim rulers, which was
improved, perfected and formally restored by Omar Khayyam
and <br>
other Iranian scientists. It was named the
&quot;Jalaali&quot; calendar after its patron, Sultan Jalal
al-Din Malekshah Saljuqi (1072-1092 CE). The Fasli year,
officially observed by Ira&acirc; <br>
nians -- Zartoshtis, Jews, Christians, and Muslims -- in
modern Iran, is the &quot;saredha&quot; of the Avestan
people, &quot;tharda&quot; of the Achaemenian,
&quot;Vihezakik&quot; of the Sassanians, and the <br>
&quot;Jalali&quot; of Omar Khayyam. The precise solar year
also reckoned by all observatories in the world. It is the
Universal Astronomical and Scientific Year. It is this
Vihezakik (Per&acirc; <br>
sian &quot;Behizaki&quot;) calendar, now called
&quot;Khorshidi&quot; (solar), the official Iranian
calendar, the precise calendar, with its dates numbered,
that the Zarathushtrian Assembly follows. <br>
It is astronomically precise. It is progressively
Zarathushtrian.</p>
