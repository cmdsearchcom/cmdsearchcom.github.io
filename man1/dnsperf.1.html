<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
dnsperf - test the performance of a DNS server</p>

dnsperf [-a local_addr] [-b bufsize] [-c clients] [-d
datafile] [-D] [-e] [-f family] [-h] [-l limit] [-n
runs_through_file] [-p port] [-q num_queries] [-Q max_qps]

[alg:]name:secret]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
dnsperf is a DNS server performance testing tool. It is
primarily intended for measuring the performance of
authoritative DNS servers, but it can also be used for
measuring <br>
caching server performance in a closed laboratory
environment. For testing caching servers resolving against
the live Internet, the resperf program is preferred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is recommended that dnsperf
and the name server under test be run on separate machines,
so that the CPU usage of dnsperf itself does not slow down
the name server. The two ma&acirc; <br>
chines should be connected with a fast network, preferably a
dedicated Gigabit Ethernet segment. Testing through a router
or firewall is not advisable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Configuring the name server <br>
If using dnsperf to test an authoritative server, the name
server under test should be set up to serve one or more
zones similar in size and number to what the server is
expected <br>
to serve in production.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also, be sure to turn off
recursion in the server&rsquo;s configuration (in BIND 8/9,
specify &quot;recursion no;&quot; in the options block). In
BIND 8, you should also specify &quot;fetch-glue <br>
no;&quot;; otherwise the server may attempt to retrieve glue
information from the Internet during the test, slowing it
down by an unpredictable factor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Constructing a query input file
<br>
A dnsperf input file should contain a large and realistic
set of queries, on the order of ten thousand to a million.
The input file contains one line per query, consisting of a
<br>
domain name and an RR type name separated by a space. The
class of the query is implicitly IN.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When measuring the performance
serving non-terminal zones such as the root zone or TLDs,
note that such servers spend most of their time providing
referral responses, not author&acirc; <br>
itative answers. Therefore, a realistic input file might
consist mostly of queries for type A for names *below*, not
at, the delegations present in the zone. For example, when
<br>
testing the performance of a server configured to be
authoritative for the top-level domain &quot;fi.&quot;,
which contains delegations for domains like
&quot;helsinki.fi&quot; and &quot;turku.fi&quot;, the <br>
input file could contain lines like</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">www.turku.fi A <br>
www.helsinki.fi A</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where the &quot;www&quot; prefix
ensures that the server will respond with a referral.
Ideally, a realistic proportion of queries for nonexistent
domains should be mixed in with those for <br>
existing ones, and the lines of the input file should be in
a random order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Constructing a dynamic update
input file <br>
To test dynamic update performance, dnsperf is run with the
-u option, and the input file is constructed of blocks of
lines describing dynamic update messages. The first line in
<br>
a block contains the zone name:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">example.com</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Subsequent lines contain
prerequisites, if there are any. Prerequisites can specify
that a name may or may not exist, an rrset may or may not
exist, or an rrset exists and its <br>
rdata matches all specified rdata for that name and type.
The keywords &quot;require&quot; and &quot;prohibit&quot;
are followed by the appropriate information. All relative
names are considered to <br>
be relative to the zone name. The following lines show the 5
types of prerequisites.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">require a <br>
require a A <br>
require a A 1.2.3.4 <br>
prohibit x <br>
prohibit x A</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Subsequent lines contain records
to be added, records to be deleted, rrsets to be deleted, or
names to be deleted. The keywords &quot;add&quot; or
&quot;delete&quot; are followed by the appropriate <br>
information. All relative names are considered to be
relative to the zone name. The following lines show the 4
types of updates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">add x 3600 A 10.1.2.3 <br>
delete y A 10.1.2.3 <br>
delete z A <br>
delete w</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each update message is
terminated by a line containing the command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">send</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Running the tests <br>
When running dnsperf, a data file (the -d option) and server
(the -s option) will normally be specified. The output of
dnsperf is mostly self-explanatory. Pay attention to the
<br>
number of dropped packets reported - when running the test
over a local Ethernet connection, it should be zero. If one
or more packets has been dropped, there may be a problem
<br>
with the network connection. In that case, the results
should be considered suspect and the test repeated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-a local_addr <br>
Specifies the local address from which to send requests. The
default is the wildcard address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b bufsize <br>
Sets the size of the socket&rsquo;s send and receive
buffers, in kilobytes. If not specified, the operating
system&rsquo;s default is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c clients <br>
Act as multiple clients. Requests are sent from multiple
sockets. The default is to act as 1 client.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d datafile <br>
Specifies the input data file. If not specified, dnsperf
will read from standard input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D <br>
Sets the DO (DNSSEC OK) bit [RFC3225] in all packets sent.
This also enables EDNS0, which is required for DNSSEC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e <br>
Enables EDNS0 [RFC2671], by adding an OPT record to all
packets sent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f family <br>
Specifies the address family used for sending DNS packets.
The possible values are &quot;inet&quot;, &quot;inet6&quot;,
or &quot;any&quot;. If &quot;any&quot; (the default value)
is specified, dnsperf will use <br>
whichever address family is appropriate for the server it is
sending packets to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h <br>
Print a usage statement and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l limit <br>
Specifies a time limit for the run, in seconds. This may
cause the input to be read multiple times, or only some of
the input to be read. The default behavior is to read <br>
the input once, and have no specific time limit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n runs_through_file <br>
Run through the input file at most this many times. If no
time limit is set, the file will be read exactly this number
of times; if a time limit is set, the file may be <br>
read fewer times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p port <br>
Sets the port on which the DNS packets are sent. If not
specified, the standard DNS port (53) is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q num_queries <br>
Sets the maximum number of outstanding requests. When this
value is reached, dnsperf will not send any more requests
until either responses are received or requests time <br>
out. The default value is 100.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Q max_qps <br>
Limits the number of requests per second. There is no
default limit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s server_addr <br>
Specifies the name or address of the server to which
requests will be sent. The default is the loopback address,
127.0.0.1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S stats_interval <br>
If this parameter is specified, a count of the number of
queries per second during the interval will be printed out
every stats_interval seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t timeout <br>
Specifies the request timeout value, in seconds. dnsperf
will no longer wait for a response to a particular request
after this many seconds have elapsed. The default is 5 <br>
seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T threads <br>
Run multiple client threads. By default, dnsperf uses one
thread for sending requests and one thread for receiving
responses. If this option is specified, dnsperf will
in&acirc; <br>
stead use N pairs of send/receive threads.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u <br>
Instructs dnsperf to send DNS dynamic update messages,
rather than queries. The format of the input file is
different in this case; see the &quot;Constructing a dynamic
update <br>
input file&quot; section for more details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v <br>
Enables verbose mode. The DNS RCODE of each response will be
reported to standard output when the response is received,
as will the latency. If a query times out, it will <br>
be reported with the special string &quot;T&quot; instead of
a normal DNS RCODE. If a query is interrupted, it will be
reported with the special string &quot;I&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x local_port <br>
Specifies the local port from which to send requests. The
default is the wildcard port (0).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If acting as multiple clients
and the wildcard port is used, each client will use a
different random port. If a port is specified, the clients
will use a range of ports <br>
starting with the specified one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-y [alg:]name:secret <br>
Add a TSIG record [RFC2845] to all packets sent, using the
specified TSIG key algorithm, name and secret, where the
algorithm defaults to hmac-md5 and the secret is ex&acirc;
<br>
pressed as a base-64 encoded string.</p>
