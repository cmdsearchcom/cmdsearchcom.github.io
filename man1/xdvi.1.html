<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Xdvi is a program for previewing dvi files, as produced e.g.
by the tex(1) program, under the X window system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Xdvi can show the file shrunken
by various integer factors, and it has a
&lsquo;&lsquo;magnifying glass&rsquo;&rsquo; for viewing
parts of the page enlarged (see the section MAGNIFIER
below). This ver&acirc; <br>
sion of xdvi is also referred to as xdvik since it uses the
kpathsea library to locate and generate font files. In
addition to that, it supports the following features:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- hyperlinks in DVI files
(section HYPERLINKS),</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- direct rendering of
Postscript&lt;tm&gt; Type1 fonts (section T1LIB),</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- source specials in the DVI
file (section SOURCE SPECIALS),</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- string search in DVI files
(section STRING SEARCH),</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- saving or printing (parts of)
the DVI file (sections PRINT DIALOG and SAVE DIALOG).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Xdvi can be compiled with the
Motif toolkit or the Xaw (Athena) toolkit (and variants of
it), and the Motif version has a slightly different GUI;
these differences are noted be&acirc; <br>
low.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Before displaying a page of a
DVI file, xdvi will check to see if the file has changed
since the last time it was displayed. If this is the case,
it will reload the file. This <br>
feature allows you to preview many versions of the same file
while running xdvi only once. Since it cannot read partial
DVI files, xdvik versions starting from 22.74.3 will
cre&acirc; <br>
ate a temporary copy of the DVI file being viewed, to ensure
that the file can be viewed without interruptions. (The
-notempfile can be used to turn off this feature).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Xdvi can show
PostScript&lt;tm&gt; specials by any of three methods. It
will try first to use Display PostScript&lt;tm&gt;, then
NeWS, then it will try to use Ghostscript to render the
im&acirc; <br>
ages. All of these options depend on additional software to
work properly; moreover, some of them may not be compiled
into this copy of xdvi.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For performance reasons, xdvi
does not render PostScript specials in the magnifying
glass.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no file name has been
specified on the command line, xdvi will try to open the
most recently opened file; if the file history (accessible
via the File &gt; Open Recent menu) is <br>
empty, or if none of the files in the history are valid DVI
files, it will pop up a file selector for choosing a file
name. (In previous versions, which didn&rsquo;t have a file
his&acirc; <br>
tory, the file selector was always used; you can set the X
resource noFileArgUseHistory to false to get back the old
behaviour.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
In addition to specifying the dvi file (with or without the
.dvi extension), xdvi supports the following command line
options. If the option begins with a &lsquo;+&rsquo; instead
of a &lsquo;-&rsquo;, <br>
the option is restored to its default value. By default,
these options can be set via the resource names given in
parentheses in the description of each option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+page Specifies the first page
to show. If + is given without a number, the last page is
assumed; the first page is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-allowshell <br>
(.allowShell) This option enables the shell escape in
PostScript specials. (For security reasons, shell escapes
are disabled by default.) This option should be rarely <br>
used; in particular it should not be used just to uncompress
files: that function is done automatically if the file name
ends in .Z, .gz, or .bz2. Shell escapes are al&acirc; <br>
ways turned off if the -safer option is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-altfont font <br>
(.altFont) Declares a default font to use when the font in
the dvi file cannot be found. This is useful, for example,
with PostScript &lt;tm&gt; fonts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-background color <br>
(.background) Determines the color of the background. Same
as -bg.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-bg color <br>
(.background) Determines the color of the background.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-browser browser <br>
(.wwwBrowser) Defines the web browser used for handling
external URLs. The value of this option or resource has the
same syntax as the BROWSER environment variable; see <br>
the explanation of that variable in the section
&lsquo;ENVIRONMENT&rsquo; below for a detailed description.
If neither the option nor the X resource wwwBrowser is
specified, the en&acirc; <br>
vironment variables BROWSER and WWWBROWSER (in that order)
are used to determine the browser command. If these are not
set either, the following default value is used: <br>
xdg-open %s:htmlview %s:firefox -remote -remote
&quot;openURL(%s,new-window)&quot;:mozilla -remote
&quot;openURL(%s,new-window)&quot;:netscape -raise -remote
&quot;openURL(%s,new-window)&quot;:xterm -e <br>
w3m %s:xterm -e lynx %s:xterm -e wget %s</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-copy (.copy) Always use the
copy operation when writing characters to the display. This
option may be necessary for correct operation on a color
display, but overstrike char&acirc; <br>
acters will be incorrect. If greyscale anti-aliasing is in
use, the -copy operation will disable the use of colorplanes
and make overstrikes come out incorrectly. See <br>
also -thorough.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-cr color <br>
(.cursorColor) Determines the color of the mouse cursor. The
default is the same as the foreground color.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-debug bitmask|string[,string
...] <br>
(.debugLevel) If nonzero, prints additional information on
standard output. The argument can be either a bitmask
specified as a decimal number, or comma-separated list of
<br>
strings. <br>
For the bitmask representation, multiple values can be
specified by adding the numbers that represent the
individual bits; e.g. to debug all all file searching and
opening <br>
commands, use 4032 (= 2048 + 1024 + 512 + 256 + 128 + 64).
Use -1 to turn on debugging of everything (this will produce
huge output). <br>
For the string representation, use the strings listed in the
following table, with a comma to separate the values; e.g.
to debug all file searching and opening commands, <br>
use search,expand,paths,hash,stat,open. (The option
&lsquo;kpathsea&rsquo; is provided as a shorthand for
these.) Note that such a list may need to be quoted to
prevent the shell <br>
from interpreting commas or spaces in the list. <br>
The individual numbers and strings have the following
meanings:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 bitmap Bitmap creation <br>
2 dvi DVI translation <br>
4 pk PK fonts <br>
8 batch Batch mode: Exit after <br>
reading the DVI file <br>
16 event Event handling <br>
32 ps PostScript interpreter calls <br>
64 stat Kpathsea stat(2) calls <br>
128 hash Kpathsea hash table lookups <br>
256 open Kpathsea file opening <br>
512 paths Kpathsea path definitions <br>
1024 expand Kpathsea path expansion <br>
2048 search Kpathsea searching <br>
4032 kpathsea All Kpathsea options <br>
4096 htex Hypertex specials <br>
8192 src Source specials <br>
16384 client Client/server mode (see -unique <br>
and -sourceposition options) <br>
32768 t1 Type1 font library messages <br>
65536 t1_verbose Verbose Type1 library messages <br>
131072 gui GUI elements</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some of the Kpathsea debugging
options are actually provided by Kpathsea; see the Debugging
section in the Kpathsea manual for more information on
these.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-density density <br>
(.densityPercent) Determines the density used when shrinking
bitmaps for fonts. A higher value produces a lighter font.
The default value is 40. If greyscaling is in <br>
use, this argument does not apply; use -gamma instead. See
also the &lsquo;S&rsquo; keystroke. Same as -S.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-display host:display <br>
Specifies the host and screen to be used for displaying the
dvi file. By default this is obtained from the environment
variable DISPLAY.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dvipspath path <br>
(.dvipsPath) Use path as the dvips program to use when
printing. The default for this is dvips. The program or
script should read the DVI file from standard input, and
<br>
write the Postscript file to standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-editor editor <br>
(.editor) Specifies the editor that will be invoked when the
source-special() action is triggered to start a reverse
search (by default via Ctrl-Mouse 1). The argument to <br>
this option is a format string in which occurrences of
&lsquo;&lsquo;%f&rsquo;&rsquo; are replaced by the file
name, occurrences of &lsquo;&lsquo;%l&rsquo;&rsquo; are
replaced by the line number within the file, and op&acirc;
<br>
tional occurrences of &lsquo;&lsquo;%c&rsquo;&rsquo; are
replaced by the column number within the line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If neither the option nor the X
resource .editor is specified, the following environment
variables are checked to determine the editor command:
XEDITOR, VISUAL, and EDITOR <br>
(in this sequence). If the string is found as the value of
the VISUAL or EDITOR environment variables, then
&lsquo;&lsquo;xterm -e &rsquo;&rsquo; is prepended to the
string; if the editor is <br>
specified by other means, then it must be in the form of a
shell command to pop up an X window with an editor in it. If
none of these variables is set, a warning message <br>
is displayed and the command &lsquo;&lsquo;xterm -e vi +%l
%f&rsquo;&rsquo; is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no
&lsquo;&lsquo;%f&rsquo;&rsquo; or
&lsquo;&lsquo;%l&rsquo;&rsquo; occurs in the string, the
missing format strings are appended automatically. (This is
for compatibility with other programs when using one of the
<br>
environment variables).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A new instance of the editor is
started each time this command is used; therefore it is
preferable to use an editor that can be invoked in
&lsquo;client&rsquo; mode to load new files <br>
into the same instance. Example settings are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">emacsclient --no-wait <br>
(older Emacsen)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gnuclient -q <br>
(XEmacs and newer Emacsen)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gvim --servername xdvi --remote
<br>
(VIM v6.0+; the &lsquo;--servername xdvi&rsquo; option will
cause gvim to run a dedicated instance for the files opened
by xdvi.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nc (nedit)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that those strings need to
be enclosed into quotes when using them on the command-line
to protect them from the shell; when using them as argument
for the .editor re&acirc; <br>
source in an X resource file, no quotes should be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE ON SECURITY: The argument
of this option isn&rsquo;t executed as a shell command, but
via exec() to prevent evil tricks with the contents of
source specials.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-expert <br>
This option is only supported for backwards compatibility;
it is equivalent to -expertmode 0, which should be
preferred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-expertmode flag <br>
(.expertMode) With an argument of 0, this option switches
off the display of the buttons, scrollbars, the toolbar
(Motif only), the statusline and the page list. These GUI
<br>
elements can also be (de)activated separately, by combining
the appropriate values in the flag argument. This acts
similar to the -debug option: The integer flag is
treat&acirc; <br>
ed as a bitmap where each bit represents one element. If the
bit has the value 1, the element is switched on, if it has
the value 0, the element is switched off. The mean&acirc;
<br>
ing of the bits is as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 statusline <br>
2 scrollbars <br>
4 Motif: pagelist, Xaw: buttons and pagelist <br>
8 toolbar (Motif only) <br>
16 menubar (Motif only)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, to turn on only the
statusline and the scrollbars, use 3 (= 1 + 2). See also the
&lsquo;x&rsquo; keystroke, where the bits are addressed by
their positions, from 1 to 3 <br>
(Xaw) or 5 (Motif), respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the statusline is not active,
all messages that would normally be printed to the
statusline will be printed to stdout, unless the -hushstdout
option is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fg color <br>
(.foreground) Determines the color of the text
(foreground).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-text-encoding encoding <br>
(.textEncoding) Use encoding as text encoding of the string
in the &quot;Find&quot; window. Usually, this
shouldn&rsquo;t be needed since the encoding is determined
from the locale set&acirc; <br>
tings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-findstring string <br>
This option triggers a search for string in the DVI file
mentioned on the command-line, similar to forward search
(see the description of the sourceposition option): If <br>
there is already another instance of xdvi running on the
displaying that DVI file, it will cause that instance to
perform the search instead. The search starts at the top
<br>
of the current page of the DVI file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-font font <br>
(*font) Sets the font used in menus, buttons etc., as
described in the X(7x) man page. The font for child windows
can be set separately, e.g.:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xdvi*statusline*font:
-*-helvetica-medium-r-*-*-12-*-*-*-*-*-*-*</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-foreground color <br>
Same as -fg.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fullscreen <br>
When this option is used, xdvi will (try to) run in
fullscreen mode, with no window decorations. This option is
not guaranteed to work with all windowmanagers/desktops;
<br>
if you&rsquo;re experiencing problems with it, please use
the -geometry option instead, and a suitable window manager
setting to remove the window decorations. When using this
<br>
option for presentations, you might want to get rid of all
the control widgets as well, using the -expertmode option.
This option can also be toggled at runtime using the <br>
fullscreen action (by default bound to Ctrl-l).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-gamma gamma <br>
(.gamma) Controls the interpolation of colors in the
greyscale anti-aliasing color palette. Default value is 1.0.
For 0 &lt; gamma &lt; 1, the fonts will be lighter (more
like <br>
the background), and for gamma &gt; 1, the fonts will be
darker (more like the foreground). Negative values behave
the same way, but use a slightly different algorithm. For
<br>
color and grayscale displays; for monochrome, see -density.
See also the &lsquo;S&rsquo; keystroke.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-geometry geometry <br>
(.geometry) Specifies the initial geometry of the main
window, as described in the X(7x) man page. The geometry of
child windows can be set separately, e.g.: <br>
xdvi*helpwindow.geometry: 600x800</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-gsalpha <br>
(.gsAlpha) Causes Ghostscript to be called with the x11alpha
driver instead of the x11 driver. The x11alpha driver
enables anti-aliasing in PostScript specials, for a <br>
nicer appearance. It is available on newer versions of
Ghostscript. This option can also be toggled with the
&lsquo;V&rsquo; keystroke.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-gspalette palette <br>
(.palette) Specifies the palette to be used when using
Ghostscript for rendering PostScript specials. Possible
values are Color, Greyscale, and Monochrome. The default
<br>
is Color.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, -help, --help <br>
Prints a short help text with an overview of the
command-line options to standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-hl color <br>
(.highlight) Determines the color of the page border, of the
ruler in &lsquo;ruler mode&rsquo;, and of the highlighting
markers in forward search and string search. The default is
<br>
the foreground color.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-anchorposition anchor <br>
Jump to anchor after opening the DVI file. This is only
useful when invoking xdvi from other applications.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-hush (.Hush) Causes xdvi to
suppress all suppressible warnings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-hushchars <br>
(.hushLostChars) Causes xdvi to suppress warnings about
references to characters which are not defined in the
font.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-hushchecksums <br>
(.hushChecksums) Causes xdvi to suppress warnings about
checksum mismatches between the dvi file and the font
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-hushstdout <br>
(.hushStdout) Suppresses printing of status messages to
stdout. Note that errors or warnings will still be printed
to stderr even if this option is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-hushbell <br>
(.hushBell) Don&rsquo;t sound the X bell when an error
occurs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-icongeometry geometry <br>
(.iconGeometry) Specifies the initial position for the
icon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-iconic <br>
(.iconic) Causes the xdvi window to start in the iconic
state. The default is to start with the window open.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-install <br>
(.install) If xdvi is running under a PseudoColor visual,
then (by default) it will check for TrueColor visuals with
more bits per pixel, and switch to such a visual if <br>
one exists. If no such visual exists, it will use the
current visual and colormap. If -install is selected,
however, it will still use a TrueColor visual with a greater
<br>
depth, if one is available; otherwise, it will install its
own colormap on the current visual. If the current visual is
not PseudoColor, then xdvi will not switch the <br>
visual or colormap, regardless of its options. The default
value of the install resource is the special value, maybe.
There is no +install option. See also -noinstall, <br>
and the GREYSCALING AND COLORMAPS section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-interpreter filename <br>
(.interpreter) Use filename as the Ghostscript interpreter.
By default it uses gs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-keep (.keepPosition) Sets a
flag to indicate that xdvi should not move to the home
position when moving to a new page. See also the
&lsquo;k&rsquo; keystroke. This flag is honored by all <br>
page switching actions and by up-or-previous() /
down-or-next(), although the latter only honor the
horizontal postion, not the vertical one. This allows for a
&quot;continu&acirc; <br>
ous&quot; scrolling back an forth through a document with a
display window narrower than a page width.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l (.listFonts) List the names
of all fonts used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-license <br>
Prints licensing information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-linkcolor <br>
(.linkColor) Color used for unvisited hyperlinks
(&lsquo;Blue2&rsquo; by default). Hyperlinks are unvisited
before you click on them, or after the DVI file has been
reloaded. The <br>
value should be either a valid X color name (such as
DarkGoldenrod4) or a hexadecimal color string (such as
#8b6508). See also -visitedlinkcolor and -linkstyle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-linkstyle <br>
(.LinkStyle) Determines the style in which hyperlinks are
displayed. Possible values and their meanings are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 No highlighting of links <br>
1 Underline links with link color <br>
2 No underlining, color text with link color <br>
3 Underline and display text colored with <br>
link color</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The values for link color are
specified by the options/resources -linkcolor and
-visitedlinkcolor (which see).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-margins dimen <br>
(.Margin) Specifies the size of both the top margin and side
margin. This determines the &lsquo;&lsquo;home&rsquo;&rsquo;
position of the page within the window as follows. If the
entire page <br>
fits in the window, then the margin settings are ignored.
If, even after removing the margins from the left, right,
top, and bottom, the page still cannot fit in the win&acirc;
<br>
dow, then the page is put in the window such that the top
and left margins are hidden, and presumably the upper
left-hand corner of the text on the page will be in the
up&acirc; <br>
per left-hand corner of the window. Otherwise, the text is
centered in the window. The dimension should be a decimal
number optionally followed by any of the two-letter <br>
abbreviations for units accepted by TeX (pt, pc, in, bp, cm,
mm, dd, cc, or sp). By default, the unit will be cm
(centimeters). See also -sidemargin, -topmargin, and the
<br>
keystroke &lsquo;M.&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mfmode mode-def <br>
(.mfMode) Specifies a mode-def string, which can be used in
searching for fonts (see ENVIRONMENT, below). Generally,
when changing the mode-def, it is also necessary to <br>
change the font size to the appropriate value for that mode.
This is done by adding a colon and the value in dots per
inch; for example, -mfmode ljfour:600. This method <br>
overrides any value given by the pixelsPerInch resource or
the -p command-line argument. The metafont mode is also
passed to metafont during automatic creation of fonts. <br>
By default, it is unspecified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mgs size <br>
Same as -mgs1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mgs[n] size <br>
(.magnifierSize[n]) Specifies the size of the window to be
used for the &lsquo;&lsquo;magnifying glass&rsquo;&rsquo;
for Button n. The size may be given as an integer
(indicating that the magni&acirc; <br>
fying glass is to be square), or it may be given in the form
widthxheight. See the MOUSE ACTIONS section. Defaults are
200x150, 400x250, 700x500, 1000x800, and <br>
1200x1200.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mousemode [0|1|2] <br>
(.mouseMode) Specifies the default mode of xdvi at startup:
Magnifier (0), Text Selection Mode (1) or Ruler Mode (2).
See the section MODES, below, for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nocolor <br>
(.color) Turns off the use of color specials. This option
can be toggled with the &lsquo;C&rsquo; keystroke. (Note:
-nocolor corresponds to color:off; +nocolor to
color:on.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nofork <br>
(.fork) With the -sourceposition and -unique options, the
default behavior is for xdvi to put itself into the
background (like a daemon) if there is no appropriate
in&acirc; <br>
stance of xdvi already running. This argument makes it run
in the foreground instead. This is useful for debugging, or
if your client application cannot deal well with a <br>
program self-backgrounding itself in this way -- e.g., the
IPC functions in emacs are known to have problems with this.
If no -sourceposition or -unique argument is giv&acirc; <br>
en, then this option has no effect. (Note: -nofork
corresponds to fork:off; +nofork to fork:on.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-noghostscript <br>
(.ghostscript) Inhibits the use of Ghostscript for
displaying PostScript&lt;tm&gt; specials. (Note:
-noghostscript corresponds to ghostscript:off;
+noghostscript to ghost&acirc; <br>
script:on.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nogrey <br>
(.grey) Turns off the use of greyscale anti-aliasing when
printing shrunken bitmaps. (Note: -nogrey corresponds to
grey:off; +nogrey to grey:on.) See also the &lsquo;G&rsquo;
key&acirc; <br>
stroke.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nogssafer <br>
(.gsSafer) Normally, if Ghostscript is used to render
PostScript specials, the Ghostscript interpreter is run with
the option -dSAFER. The -nogssafer option runs Ghost&acirc;
<br>
script without -dSAFER. The -dSAFER option in Ghostscript
disables PostScript operators such as deletefile, to prevent
possibly malicious PostScript programs from having <br>
any effect. If the -safer option is specified, then this
option has no effect; in that case Ghostscript is always run
with -dSAFER. (Note: -nogssafer corresponds to <br>
gsSafer:off; +nogssafer to gsSafer:on.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-noinstall <br>
(.install) Inhibit the default behavior of switching to a
TrueColor visual if one is available with more bits per
pixel than the current visual. (Note: -noinstall
corre&acirc; <br>
sponds install:off; there is no +noinstall option.) See also
-install, and the GREYSCALING AND COLORMAPS section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nomakepk <br>
(.makePk) Turns off automatic generation of font files that
cannot be found by other means. (Note: -nomakepk corresponds
to makePk:off; +nomakepk to makePK:on.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nomatchinverted <br>
(.matchInverted) Don&rsquo;t highlight string search matches
in inverted color; instead, draw a rectangle in highlight
color (see the -hl option) around the match. This option
<br>
is activated automatically if the display isn&rsquo;t
running in TrueColor. (Note: -nomatchinverted corresponds to
matchInverted:off; +nomatchinverted to
matchInverted:on.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-noomega <br>
(.omega) This will disable the use of Omega extensions when
interpreting DVI files. By default, the additional opcodes
129 and 134 are recognized by xdvi as Omega exten&acirc;
<br>
sions and interpreted as requests to set 2-byte characters.
The only drawback is that the virtual font array will
require 65536 positions instead of the default 256
posi&acirc; <br>
tions, i.e. the memory requirements of xdvi will be slightly
larger. If you find this unacceptable or encounter another
problem with the Omega extensions, you can switch <br>
this extension off by using -noomega (but please do send a
bug report if you find such problems - see the bug address
in the AUTHORS section below). <br>
(Note: -noomega corresponds to omega: off; +noomega to
omega: on.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-noscan <br>
(.prescan) By default, xdvi does a preliminary scan of the
dvi file to process any papersize specials; this is
especially important at startup since the paper size may be
<br>
needed to determine the window size. If PostScript&lt;tm&gt;
is in use, then prescanning is also necessary in order to
properly process header files. In addition, prescanning <br>
is needed to correctly determine the background color of a
page. This option turns off such prescanning. (Prescanning
will be automatically be turned back on if xdvi de&acirc;
<br>
tects any of the specials mentioned above.) (Note: -noscan
corresponds to prescan:off; +noscan to prescan:on.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-not1lib <br>
(.t1lib) This will disable the use of T1Lib to display
PostScript&lt;tm&gt; fonts. Use this option as a workaround
when you encounter problems with the display of T1Lib (but
<br>
please don&rsquo;t forget to send a bug report in this case,
to the URL mentioned in the section AUTHORS below). <br>
(Note: -not1lib corresponds to t1lib:off; +not1lib to
t1lib:on.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-notempfile <br>
(.tempFile) As mentioned in the section DESCRIPTION above,
xdvi will create a temporary copy of the DVI file so that it
can be accessed without interruptions even while <br>
the file is being rewritten by TeX. Since this introduces
the overhead of copying the file every time it has changed,
the -notempfile allows you to turn off this behav&acirc;
<br>
iour. In this case, exposing parts of the window while the
DVI file is being written by TeX will erase the current
window contents until the DVI file can be completely <br>
reread. <br>
(Note: -notempfile corresponds to tempFile:off; +notempfile
to tempFile:on.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-offsets dimen <br>
(.Offset) Specifies the size of both the horizontal and
vertical offsets of the output on the page. By decree of the
Stanford TeX Project, the default TeX page origin is <br>
always 1 inch over and down from the top-left page corner,
even when non-American paper sizes are used. Therefore, the
default offsets are 1.0 inch. The argument dimen <br>
should be a decimal number optionally followed by any of the
two-letter abbreviations for units accepted by TeX (pt, pc,
in, bp, cm, mm, dd, cc, or sp). By default, the <br>
unit will be cm (centimeters). See also -xoffset and
-yoffset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p pixels <br>
(.pixelsPerInch) Defines the size of the fonts to use, in
pixels per inch. The default value is 600. This option is
provided only for backwards compatibility; the pre&acirc;
<br>
ferred way is to set both the resolution and the Metafont
mode via the -mfmode option (which see).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-paper papertype <br>
(.paper) Specifies the size of the printed page. Note that
in most cases it&rsquo;s best to specify the paper size in
the TeX input file via the line</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sepackage[dvips]{geometry}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">which will be recognized by both
dvips and xdvi; in that case the use of a
&lsquo;-paper&rsquo; option should be unnecessary. <br>
The paper size may be specified in the form widthxheight
optionally followed by a unit, where width and height are
decimal numbers giving the width and height of the pa&acirc;
<br>
per, respectively, and the unit is any of the two-letter
abbreviations for units accepted by TeX (pt, pc, in, bp, cm,
mm, dd, cc, or sp). By default, the unit is cm (cen&acirc;
<br>
timeters). <br>
There are also synonyms which may be used: us (8.5x11in),
legal (8.5x14in), foolscap (13.5x17in), as well as the ISO
sizes a1-a7, b1-b7, c1-c7. Each of these also has a <br>
landscape or &lsquo;rotated&rsquo; variant: usr (11x8.5in),
a1r-a7r, etc. For compatibility with dvips, the formats
letter (8.5x11in), ledger (17x11in) and tabloid (11x17in)
are also <br>
supported (these don&rsquo;t have rotated variants). <br>
Any of the above sizes may be preceded by a plus sign
(&lsquo;+&rsquo;); this causes the paper size given here to
override any paper size given in the dvi file. The default
paper <br>
size is 21 x 29.7 cm (A4 size).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pause (.pause) This option
provides a simple implementation of incremental (stepwise)
display, which can be used for presentations. When this
option is used, xdvi will pause <br>
the display of the current page whenever it encounters a
special special-string (xdvi:pause by default; the string
can be customized via -pausespecial, see below), and the
<br>
cursor will change its shape. The action unpause-or-next()
(by default bound to the Space key) will display the next
portion of the page up to the following special- <br>
string, or until the end of the page is reached. When the
option is not used, specials containing special-string will
be ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pausespecial special-string
<br>
(.pauseSpecial) Sets the special string that causes xdvi to
pause when the -pause option is active. The default value of
special-string is xdvi:pause.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-postscript flag <br>
(.postscript) If flag = 0, rendering of PostScript&lt;tm&gt;
specials is disabled; instead, bounding boxes will be
displayed (if available). A value of 1 (the default)
switches <br>
PostScript&lt;tm&gt; specials on. With a value of 2, the
PostScript&lt;tm&gt; specials are displayed along with their
bounding boxes; this allows you to visually check the
correctness <br>
of the bounding boxes. The values can also be toggled at
runtime with the &lsquo;v&rsquo; keystroke and the
corresponding numerical prefix arguments 0, 1 and 2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ps2pdfpath path <br>
(.ps2pdfPath) Use path as a conversion program from
Postscript to PDF. The program or script should accept two
command-line arguments: The Postscript file as first
argu&acirc; <br>
ment, and the PDF output file as second argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-rulecolor color <br>
(.ruleColor) Determines the color of the rules used for the
the magnifier (default: foreground color).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q (.noInitFile) Ignore the
$HOME/.xdvirc startup file (i.e. don&rsquo;t read it at
startup, and don&rsquo;t write it at exit). This forces the
defaults defined in $HOME/.Xdefaults to be <br>
used. See FILES for more information on $HOME/.xdvirc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-rv (.reverseVideo) Causes the
page to be displayed with white characters on a black
background, instead of vice versa.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S density <br>
(.densityPercent) Same as -density (which see).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s shrink <br>
(.shrinkFactor) Defines the initial shrink factor. The
default value is 8. If shrink is given as 0, then the
initial shrink factor is computed so that the page fits <br>
within the window (as if the &lsquo;s&rsquo; keystroke were
given without a number).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-safer (.safer) This option
turns on all available security options; it is designed for
use when xdvi is called by a browser that obtains a dvi or
TeX file from another site. <br>
This option selects +nogssafer and +allowshell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sidemargin dimen <br>
(.sideMargin) Specifies the side margin (see -margins).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sourceposition line[:col][
]filename <br>
This option makes xdvi search in the dvi file for the place
corresponding to the indicated line (and, optionally,
column) in the .tex source file, and highlight the place
<br>
found by drawing a rectangle in the highlight color (see the
-hl option) around the corresponding text. In addition, when
run with this argument (and the -nofork option <br>
is not given, which see), xdvi will always return
immediately: if it finds another instance of xdvi already
showing dvi_file, then it will cause that instance to raise
<br>
its window and move to the given place in the dvi file;
otherwise it will start up its own instance in the
background. If several instances of xdvi are displaying the
re&acirc; <br>
spective dvi file, the instance which was last raised to the
foreground will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The space before filename is
only needed if the filename starts with a digit. When the
space is used, the argument needs to be enclosed in quotes
to prevent the shell <br>
from misinterpreting the space as argument separator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option requires that
dvi_file be prepared with source special information. See
the section on SOURCE SPECIALS for details on how to do
this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here is a more detailed
description of how the filename in the -sourceposition
argument is matched with the filename in the source
specials:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. If neither of the filenames
contains a path name component, the filenames are compared
ignoring the &lsquo;.tex&rsquo; extensions in both
filenames.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Otherwise, if one of the
filenames does contain a path component (e.g.: ./test.tex,
../test.tex, /my/homedir/tex/test.tex or any combination of
these), both filenames <br>
are expanded to a full path, with any occurrences of ../ and
./ expanded, and multiple slashes removed. <br>
The pathname in the -sourceposition is expanded relative to
the current working directory of the xdvi -sourceposition
invocation, and the pathnames in the source spe&acirc; <br>
cials are expanded relative to the path of the current DVI
file being viewed. <br>
The path names are then compared ignoring the
&lsquo;.tex&rsquo; extensions in both path names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-statusline <br>
(.statusline) This option is obsolete; use -expertmode flag
instead (which see).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-thorough <br>
(.thorough) Xdvi will usually try to ensure that overstrike
characters (e.g., 0tin) are printed correctly. On monochrome
displays, this is always possible with one log&acirc; <br>
ical operation, either and or or. On color displays,
however, this may take two operations, one to set the
appropriate bits and one to clear other bits. If this is the
<br>
case, then by default xdvi will instead use the copy
operation, which does not handle overstriking correctly. The
-thorough option chooses the slower but more correct <br>
choice. See also -copy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-topmargin dimen <br>
(.topMargin) Specifies the top and bottom margins (see
-margins).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-unique <br>
(.unique) This option will make another instance of xdvi
running on the same display act as a &lsquo;server&rsquo;.
For example, the invocation</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xdvi -unique +5 file.dvi</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will cause this other instance
to load file.dvi on page 5 in place of the file that it is
currently displaying. If there is already another instance
of xdvi already dis&acirc; <br>
playing the file file.dvi, then it will just jump to page 5.
If the other instance of xdvi is displaying a different
file, it will load file.dvi instead. Otherwise, if no <br>
other instance of xdvi is currently running on the display,
this option instead starts a new instance of xdvi in the
background (unless the -nofork option is specified, <br>
which see) displaying page 5 of file.dvi. <br>
The filename and the +n option for the page number are the
only options available for controlling a remote instance of
xdvi like this; all other options are currently ig&acirc;
<br>
nored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-useTeXpages <br>
Use logical TeX pages (the values of the stroke (or the
goto-page() action). This option can be toggled via the
&lsquo;T&rsquo; keystroke.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-version <br>
Print information on the version of xdvi.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-visitedlinkcolor <br>
(.visitedLinkColor) Color used for visited hyperlinks
(&lsquo;Purple4&rsquo; by default). Hyperlinks become
visited once you click on them. As for linkColor, the value
should be ei&acirc; <br>
ther a valid X color name or a hexadecimal color string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-warnspecials <br>
(.warnSpecials) Causes xdvi to print warnings about cial
strings that it cannot process to stderr. These warnings are
suppressed by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-watchfile n <br>
(.watchFile) If this option is set to a value larger than 0,
xdvi will check the DVI file for changes every n seconds. If
the DVI file has been completely written by TeX, <br>
it will be reloaded automatically. Fractional values (e.g.
&lsquo;2.5&rsquo;) are possible. The default for this option
is 0, i.e. no watching. <br>
Since xdvi cannot handle partial DVI files, it tries not to
reload the file while it is being rewritten. However, use of
the magnifier or switching of pages requires <br>
reading (a part of) the DVI file, and if the tempfile option
is switched off, this will erase the current contents of the
window until the DVI file can be read entirely.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-wheelunit pixels <br>
(.wheelUnit) Sets the number of pixels that a motion of a
wheel mouse will move the image up, down, left, or right.
(See the wheel and hwheel actions, below, for more in&acirc;
<br>
formation on this.) If set to zero, the wheel mouse
functionality is (essentially) disabled. The default value
is 80.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-xoffset dimen <br>
(.xOffset) Specifies the size of the horizontal offset of
the output on the page. See -offsets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-yoffset dimen <br>
(.yOffset) Specifies the size of the vertical offset of the
output on the page. See -offsets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KEYSTROKES <br>
Xdvi recognizes the following keystrokes when typed in its
window. Each may optionally be preceded by a (positive or
negative) number, a &lsquo;prefix argument&rsquo;, whose
interpretation <br>
will depend on the particular keystroke. This prefix
argument can be discarded by pressing the
&lsquo;&lsquo;Escape&rsquo;&rsquo; key. If present, the
&lsquo;&lsquo;Help&rsquo;&rsquo;,
&lsquo;&lsquo;Prior&rsquo;&rsquo; and
&lsquo;&lsquo;Next&rsquo;&rsquo; keys are syn&acirc; <br>
onyms for &lsquo;?&rsquo;, &lsquo;b&rsquo;, and
&lsquo;f&rsquo; keys, respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The key bindings listed here are
those that xdvi assigns by default. The names appearing in
brackets at the beginning of the descriptions are the names
of the actions associated <br>
with the keys; these can be used to customize the key
bindings, as explained in more detail in the section
CUSTOMIZATION below. If only a lowercase binding is listed,
both upper- <br>
and lowercase keys will work for that binding.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ESC key <br>
[discard-number()] The escape key discards the numerical
prefix for all actions (useful when you mistyped a
number).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Return key <br>
[forward-page()] Moves to the next page (or to the nth next
page if a number is given). Synonyms are &lsquo;n&rsquo;,
&lsquo;f&rsquo; and Line Feed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Backspace key <br>
[back-pagee()] Moves to the previous page (or back n pages).
Synonyms are &lsquo;p&rsquo;, &lsquo;b&rsquo; and
Ctrl-h.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Delete key <br>
[up-or-previous()] Moves up two-thirds of a window-full, or
to the top of the previous page if already at the top of the
page. With a float argument, moves up the corre&acirc; <br>
sponding fraction of a window-full.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Space key <br>
[unpause-or-next()] Moves down two-thirds of a window-full,
or to the next page if already at the bottom of the page.
<br>
When the option -pause special-string is used and the
display is currently paused, this key will instead display
the next portion of the page until the next special-string
<br>
or the end of the page is encountered. See the description
of the -pause option for details. The action
[down-or-next()] does a similar thing, but without pausing;
it is <br>
not bound to a key by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ctrl-Home (Xaw),
Ctrl-osfBeginLine (Motif) <br>
[goto-page(1)] Moves to the first page of the document.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ctrl-End (Xaw), Ctrl-osfEndLine
(Motif) <br>
[goto-page()] Moves to the last page of the document.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Home (Xaw), osfBeginLine (Motif)
<br>
[home-or-top()] Move to the &lsquo;&lsquo;home&rsquo;&rsquo;
position of the page, or to the top of the page if the keep
flag is set (in this case, the page doesn&rsquo;t scroll
horizontally).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">End (Xaw), osfEndLine (Motif)
<br>
[end-or-bottom()] Move to the
&lsquo;&lsquo;end&rsquo;&rsquo; position of the page (the
lower right-hand corner), or to the bottom of the page if
the keep flag is set (in this case, the page <br>
doesn&rsquo;t scroll horizontally).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Down arrow <br>
[down(0.015)] Scrolls page down.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Up arrow <br>
[up(0.015)] Scrolls page up.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Right arrow <br>
[right(0.015)] Scrolls page right.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Left arrow <br>
[left(0.015)] Scrolls page left.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alt-Ctrl-+ <br>
[change-density(25)] Increase the darkness of the fonts in
the DVI window by adding to the gamma value (see also the
&lsquo;S&rsquo; keystroke).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alt-Ctrl-- <br>
[change-density(-25)] Decrease the darkness of the fonts in
the DVI window by subtracting from the gamma value (see also
the &lsquo;S&rsquo; keystroke).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ctrl-+ [set-shrink-factor(+)]
Increase the shrink factor (see also the &lsquo;s&rsquo;
keystroke).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ctrl-- [set-shrink-factor(-)]
Decrease the shrink factor (see also the &lsquo;s&rsquo;
keystroke).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ctr-[
[pagehistory-delete-backward()] Delete the current item in
the page history and move to the history item before the
deleted one. With a prefix argument n, delete n previ&acirc;
<br>
ous history items. See PAGE HISTORY for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[ [pagehistory-back()] Move back
in the page history (see PAGE HISTORY for details). With a
prefix argument n, move back n history items.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ctr-]
[pagehistory-delete-forward()] Delete the current item in
the page history and move to the history item after the
deleted one. With a prefix argument n, delete n next
his&acirc; <br>
tory items. See PAGE HISTORY for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">] [pagehistory-forward()] Move
forward in the page history (see PAGE HISTORY for details).
With a prefix argument n, move forward n history items.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^ [home()] Move to the
&lsquo;&lsquo;home&rsquo;&rsquo; position of the page. This
is normally the upper left-hand corner of the page,
depending on the margins as described in the -margins
option, <br>
above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">? [help()] Same as the h key
(which see).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">B [htex-back()] This key jumps
back to the previous hyperlink anchor. See the section
HYPERLINKS for more information on navigating the links.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">b [back-page()] Moves to the
previous page (or back n pages). Synonyms are
&lsquo;p&rsquo;, Ctrl-h and Backspace.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C [set-color()] This key toggles
the use of color specials. The key sequences
&lsquo;0C&rsquo; and &lsquo;1C&rsquo; turn interpretation of
color specials off and on, respectively. See also the <br>
-nocolor option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c [center()] Moves the page so
that the point currently beneath the mouse cursor is moved
to the middle of the window, and warps the mouse cursor to
the same place.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">D [toggle-grid-mode()] This key
toggles the use of a grid on the displayed page. If no
number is given, the grid mode is switched on or off. By
prepending a number from 1 <br>
to 3, 3 different grid levels can be set. The units of the
grid are inches or centimeters, depending on whether the
paper format is letter (in) or a4 (cm).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">d [down()] Moves page down two
thirds of a window-full. With a float argument to
&lsquo;&lsquo;down&rsquo;&rsquo;, moves down the
corresponding fraction of a window-full.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ctrl-f [find()] Pop up a window
to search for a string in the DVI file. See the section
STRING SEARCH, below, for more details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f [forward-page()] Moves to the
next page (or to the nth next page if a number is given).
Synonyms are &lsquo;n&rsquo;, Return, and Line Feed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">G [set-greyscaling()] This key
toggles the use of greyscale anti-aliasing for displaying
shrunken bitmaps. In addition, the key sequences
&lsquo;0G&rsquo; and &lsquo;1G&rsquo; clear and set this
<br>
flag, respectively. See also the -nogrey option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If given a numeric argument that
is not 0 or 1, greyscale anti-aliasing is turned on, and the
gamma resource is set to the value divided by 100. E.g.,
&lsquo;150G&rsquo; turns on <br>
greyscale and sets gamma to 1.5.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ctrl-g [find-next()] Find the
next match string in the DVI file; this can be used instead
of pressing the &lsquo;Find&rsquo; button in the search
window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">g [goto-page()] Moves to the
page with the given number. If no page number is given, xdvi
jumps to the last page. <br>
If the option/resource useTeXpages is active, the numbers
correspond to the actual page numbers in the TeX file;
otherwise, absolute page numbers (starting from 1) are <br>
used. In the latter case, the page numbers can be changed
with the &lsquo;P&rsquo; keystroke, below. Note that with
the useTeXpages option it is possible that the same page
number <br>
occurs multiple times; in such a case, xdvi will use the
first page number that matches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">h Pops up a help window with a
short explanation of the most important key bindings and
concepts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">k [set-keep-flag()] Normally
when xdvi switches pages, it moves to the home position as
well. The &lsquo;k&rsquo; keystroke toggles a
&lsquo;keep-position&rsquo; flag which, when set, will keep
<br>
the same position when moving between pages. Also
&lsquo;0k&rsquo; and &lsquo;1k&rsquo; clear and set this
flag, respectively. See also the -keep option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ctrl-l [fullscreen(toggle)]
Toggles fullscreen mode (see the description of the
-fullscreen option for more information on this). This is
even more flaky than using the command- <br>
line option: There is no universal standard how a window
could change its own geometry or window decorations at
run-time, so this will not work with most window managers
<br>
or desktops. Generally, it&rsquo;s better to use the window
manager controls to change the size or decorations of the
xdvi window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">l [left()] Moves page left two
thirds of a window-full.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">M [set-margins()] Sets the
margins so that the point currently under the mouse cursor
defines the upper left-hand corner of the text in the page.
Note that the command does <br>
not move the image, but only determines the margins for the
page switching commands. For details on how the margins are
used, see the -margins option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">m [toggle-mark()] Toggles the
mark for the current page in the page list. When a page is
marked, it is displayed with a small star &lsquo;*&rsquo;
next to the page number. The marked <br>
pages can then be printed or saved to a file. A page or
several pages can also be marked by clicking or dragging
Mouse-2 in the page list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ctrl-n
[toggle-mark()forward-page()] Toggles the mark for the
current page in the page list, and moves to the next page.
This lets you quickly mark a series of subsequent pages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">n [forward-page()] Moves to the
next page (or to the nth next page if a number is given).
Synonyms are &lsquo;f&rsquo;, Return, and Line Feed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ctrl-o [select-dvi-file()] Read
a new dvi file. A file-selection widget is popped up for you
to choose the DVI file from. If a prefix argument n is
given, the n th file from the <br>
file history is opened instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">P [declare-page-number()]
&lsquo;&lsquo;This is page number n.&rsquo;&rsquo; This can
be used to make the &lsquo;g&rsquo; keystroke refer to a
different page number than the physical page. (If you want
to <br>
use &lsquo;logical&rsquo; or TeX page numbers instead of
physical pages, consider using the option -useTeXpages
instead.) The argument n should be given as prefix to this
key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ctrl-p [print()] Opens a popup
window for printing the DVI file, or parts of it. See the
section PRINT DIALOG for an explanation of the options
available, and the resources to <br>
customize the default behaviour.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">p [back-page()] Moves to the
previous page (or back n pages). Synonyms are
&lsquo;b&rsquo;, Ctrl-h and Backspace.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">q [quit()] Quits the
program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ctrl-r [forward-page(0)]
Redisplays the current page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">R [reread-dvi-file()] Forces the
dvi file to be reread. This allows you to preview many
versions of the same file while running xdvi only once.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">r [right()] Moves page right two
thirds of a window-full.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ctrl-s [save()] Opens a popup
window for saving the DVI file, or parts of it. See the
section SAVE DIALOG below for more information on this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">S [set-density()] Sets the
density factor to be used when shrinking bitmaps. This
should be a number between 0 and 100; higher numbers produce
lighter characters. If <br>
greyscaling mode is in effect, this changes the value of
gamma instead. The new value of gamma is the given number
divided by 100; negative values are allowed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">s [set-shrink-factor()] Changes
the shrink factor to the given number. If no number is
given, the smallest factor that makes the entire page fit in
the window will be used. <br>
(Margins are ignored in this computation.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">T [use-tex-pages()] Use logical
TeX pages (the values of the goto-page(). See also the
-useTeXpages option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">t [switch-magnifier-units()]
Switches the units used for the magnifier tick marks, and
for reporting the distance between the mouse pointer and the
ruler centre in ruler <br>
mode (see the section MODES). The default value is specified
by the X resource tickUnits (&lsquo;mm&rsquo; by default).
The units toggle through the following values; except for
<br>
&lsquo;px&rsquo;, they all correspond to TeX&rsquo;s units:
mm (millimeters) pt (TeX points), in (inches), sp (scaled
points, the unit used internally by TeX) bp (big points or
&lsquo;Postscript <br>
points&rsquo;), cc (cicero points), dd (didot points), pc
(pica), and px (screen pixels).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ctrl-u
[back-page()toggle-mark()] Moves to the previous page, and
toggles the mark for that page. This is the dual action to
Ctrl-n.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">u [up()] Moves page up two
thirds of a window-full. With a float argument to
&lsquo;&lsquo;up&rsquo;&rsquo;, moves up the corresponding
fraction of a window-full.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ctrl-v [show-source-specials()]
Show bounding boxes for every source special on the current
page, and print the strings contained in these specials to
stderr. With prefix 1, show <br>
every bounding box on the page. This is for debugging
purposes mainly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">V [set-gs-alpha()] This key
toggles the anti-aliasing of PostScript&lt;tm&gt; specials
when Ghostscript is used as renderer. In addition the key
sequences &lsquo;0V&rsquo; and &lsquo;1V&rsquo; clear and
<br>
set this flag, respectively. See also the -gsalpha
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">v [set-ps()] This key toggles
the rendering of PostScript&lt;tm&gt; specials between 3
states:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- specials (like EPS graphics)
are displayed;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- specials are displayed along
with their bounding box (if available);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- only the bounding box is
displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The states can also be selected
directly by using &lsquo;1v&rsquo;, &lsquo;2v&rsquo; and
&lsquo;0v&rsquo; respectively. See also the -postscript
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ctrl-x [source-what-special()]
Display information about the source special next to the
mouse cursor in the statusline. This is the same special
that would be found by source- <br>
special(), but without invoking the editor. For debugging
purposes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">x [set-expert-mode()] Toggles
expert mode, in which the statusline, the scrollbars, the
menu buttons, the toolbar (Motif only) and the page list are
not shown. Typing &lsquo;1x&rsquo; <br>
toggles the display of the statusline at the bottom of the
window. Typing &lsquo;2x&rsquo; toggles the scrollbars (if
available). For Xaw, &lsquo;3x&rsquo; toggles the menu
buttons and the page <br>
list, for Motif, it toggles the page list. In Motif, the
additional bindings &lsquo;4x&rsquo; toggle the toolbar, and
&lsquo;5x&rsquo; the menu bar. <br>
Without a prefix argument, all of the mentioned GUI elements
are either switched on (if they had been invisible before)
or off. <br>
Toggling the scrollbars may behave erratically with the Xaw
widgets; e.g. the scrollbars may reappear after resizing the
window, and at certain window sizes one of the <br>
scrollbars may fail to disappear. <br>
See also the option -expertmode (the numbers above
correspond to the bits in the argument to -expertmode).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MOUSE ACTIONS IN THE MAIN WINDOW
<br>
The mouse actions can be customized by setting the X
resource mouseTranslations. Since there are three different
mouse modes (see the section MODES below), there is a
special <br>
action mouse-modes which lists the actions for each of the
three modes: mouse-modes(&quot;ACTIONS-FOR-MODE1&quot;,
&quot;ACTIONS-FOR-MODE2&quot;,
&quot;ACTIONS-FOR-MODE3&quot;). If only one argument is
spec&acirc; <br>
ified, this action is used for all modes. The default
bindings are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xdvi.mouseTranslations:
Shift&lt;Btn1Down&gt;:mouse-modes(&quot;drag(+)&quot;)
Shift&lt;Btn2Down&gt;:mouse-modes(&quot;drag(|)&quot;)
Shift&lt;Btn3Down&gt;:mouse-modes(&quot;drag(-)&quot;)
Ctrl&lt;Btn1Down&gt;:mouse-modes(&quot;source-special()&quot;)
&lt;Btn1Down&gt;:
mouse-modes(&quot;do-href()magnifier(*2)&quot;,
&quot;text-selection()&quot;, &quot;ruler()&quot;)
&lt;Btn2Down&gt;:
mouse-modes(&quot;do-href-newwindow()magnifier(*2)&quot;,
&quot;text-selection()&quot;, &quot;ruler()&quot;)
&lt;Btn3Down&gt;: mouse-modes(&quot;magnifier(*3)&quot;)
&lt;Btn4Down&gt;: mouse-modes(&quot;wheel(-0.2)&quot;)
&lt;Btn5Down&gt;: mouse-modes(&quot;wheel(0.2)&quot;)
&lt;Btn6Down&gt;: mouse-modes(&quot;hwheel(-0.2)&quot;)
&lt;Btn7Down&gt;: mouse-modes(&quot;hwheel(0.2)&quot;) <br>
All of these actions are described in more detail below.
Note the use of quote symbols around the action strings,
which are necessary to group them into one argument. Buttons
<br>
4, 5, 6, and 7 refer to wheel movements (wheel
up/down/left/right) on wheel mice. Not all mice support
horizontal scrolling.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The X Toolkit routines that
implement translations do not support event types of
Btn6Down or Btn7Down. Because of this, xdvi implements its
own parser for translations given in <br>
mouseTranslations. This parser is more limited than the
parser built in to the X Toolkit. The string given in
mouseTranslations should not begin with
&lsquo;&lsquo;#replace&rsquo;&rsquo;,
&lsquo;&lsquo;#aug&acirc; <br>
ment&rsquo;&rsquo;, or
&lsquo;&lsquo;#override&rsquo;&rsquo;. Modifiers of the form
@keysym are not supported, and the event type must be of the
form BtnDown or BtnnDown, where n is a positive integer
without <br>
leading zeroes. Also, some limitations apply to the action
field.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">do-href()</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">do-href-newwindow() <br>
Usually, if a binding specifies more then one action, all
actions are executed in a sequence. The hyperlink bindings
do-href() and do-href-newwindow() are special in that <br>
they are used as an alternative to other actions that might
follow them if the mouse is currently located on a
hyperlink. In this case, none of the other actions will be
<br>
executed; otherwise, only the other actions are executed.
<br>
The action do-href() jumps to the link target in the current
xdvi window (eventually switching to another page), and
do-href-newwindow() opens a new instance of xdvi for <br>
the link target. In both cases, the location of the target
is indicated by a small arrow drawn in the same color as a
visited link in the left corner of the window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">magnifier(n x m)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">magnifier(*n) <br>
This action will pop up a &lsquo;&lsquo;magnifying
glass&rsquo;&rsquo; which shows the unshrunk image of the
region around the mouse pointer. The magnifier disappears
when the mouse button is <br>
released. Moving the mouse cursor while holding the button
down will move the magnifier. <br>
Different mouse buttons produce different sized windows, as
indicated by the the argument of the magnifier() action. Its
argument is either a string of the form widthx&acirc; <br>
height, as in the -mgsn command-line option, or one of the
strings *1 through *5, referring to the value specified by
the corresponding -mgsn option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">drag(+)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">drag(|)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">drag(-) <br>
Drags the page with the mouse. This action should have one
parameter, the character &lsquo;&lsquo;|&rsquo;&rsquo;,
&lsquo;&lsquo;-&rsquo;&rsquo;, or
&lsquo;&lsquo;+&rsquo;&rsquo;, indicating vertical dragging
only, horizontal dragging only, or <br>
dragging in all directions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">source-special() <br>
This action starts a &lsquo;&lsquo;reverse
search&rsquo;&rsquo;, opening the editor at the location in
the TeX file corresponding to the pointer location in the
DVI file. See the section on <br>
SOURCE SPECIALS, below, for more information on this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wheel() <br>
This action can be used to scroll the image with a wheel
mouse, where it is usually bound to mouse button 4 (wheel
up) or 5 (wheel down). The action takes one parameter, <br>
giving the distance to scroll the image. If the parameter
contains a decimal point, the distance is given in wheel
units; otherwise, pixels. A negative value scrolls up, <br>
a positive value scrolls down.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hwheel() <br>
This action can be used to scroll the image horizontally
with a wheel mouse, where it is usually bound to mouse
button 6 (wheel left) or 7 (wheel right). The action takes
<br>
one parameter, giving the distance to scroll the image. If
the parameter contains a decimal point, the distance is
given in wheel units; otherwise, pixels. A negative <br>
value scrolls left, a positive value scrolls right. Not all
mice support horizontal scrolling; this is mostly for
touchpads, trackpads, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">text-selection() <br>
This action allows you to mark a rectangular region of text
in the DVI file. The text is put into the X selection buffer
and can be pasted into other applictions (e.g. <br>
text editors). This works similar to the Plain text option
in the Save dialog; see the discussion there for more
information on encoding issues.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ruler() <br>
This action creates a cross-shaped ruler. Moving the mouse
and holding the button down drags the ruler and lets you
measure distances on the page. See the section Ruler <br>
Mode for more information on this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UNBOUND ACTIONS <br>
The following actions are not bound to a key by default, but
are available for customization.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">quit-confirm() <br>
Pops up a confirmation window to quit xdvi. To bind it to
the &lsquo;q&rsquo; key instead of the default
&lsquo;quit()&rsquo; action, put the following into your
~/.Xdefaults file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xdvi.mainTranslations: #override
&lt;Key&gt;q: quit-confirm()</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">down-or-next() <br>
Similar to unpause-or-next(): Moves down two-thirds of a
window-full, or to the next page if already at the bottom of
the page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">shrink-to-dpi() <br>
This action takes one (required) argument. It sets the
shrink factor to an integer so as to approximate the use of
fonts with the corresponding number of dots per inch. <br>
If xdvi is using fonts scaled for p dots per inch, and the
argument to shrink-to-dpi is n, then the corresponding
shrink factor is the ratio p/n, rounded to the nearest <br>
integer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CUSTOMIZATION <br>
Key and mouse button assignments can be changed by setting
the mainTranslations resource to a string of translations as
defined in the documentation for the X toolkit. The
ac&acirc; <br>
tions should take the form of action names listed in the
KEYSTROKES and MOUSE ACTIONS sections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An exception to this are the
Motif keys osfPageUp (PgUp), osfPageDown (PgDown),
osfBeginLine (Home) and osfEndLine (End) which are currently
not customizable in the Motif ver&acirc; <br>
sion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Key actions will usually be
without arguments; if they are passed an argument, it
represents the optional number or &lsquo;prefix
argument&rsquo; typed prior to the action.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some key actions may take
special arguments, as follows: The argument of goto-page may
be the letter &lsquo;e&rsquo;, indicating the action of
going to the end of the document. The argument <br>
of set-shrink-factor may be the letter &lsquo;a&rsquo;,
indicating that the shrink factor should be set to the
smallest value such that the page will fit in the window, or
one of the signs <br>
&lsquo;+&rsquo; or &lsquo;-&rsquo;, indicating that the
shrink factor should be increased or decreased,
respectively. Finally, actions that would perform a toggle,
such as set-keep-flag, may receive an <br>
argument &lsquo;t&rsquo;, indicating that the action should
toggle regardless of the current prefix argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mouse actions should refer only
to ButtonPress events (e.g.,
&lt;Btn1Down&gt;:magnifier(*1)). The corresponding motion
and release events will be handled internally. A key action
may <br>
be bound to a mouse event, but not vice versa.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Usually the string of
translations should begin with
&lsquo;&lsquo;#override&rsquo;&rsquo;, indicating that the
default key and mouse button assignments should not be
discarded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When keys or mouse buttons
involving modifiers (such as Ctrl or Shift) are customized
together with their non-modified equivalents, the modified
keys should come first, for exam&acirc; <br>
ple:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xdvi.mainTranslations: #override
Shift&lt;Key&gt;s: select-dvi-file() Ctrl&lt;Key&gt;s:
save() &lt;Key&gt;s: find()</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Because xdvi needs to capture
pointer motion events, and because the X Toolkit
translations mechanism cannot accommodate both motion events
and double-click events at the same <br>
time, it is not possible to specify double-click actions in
xdvi customizations. For information on this and other
aspects of translations, see the X Toolkit Intrinsics
documen&acirc; <br>
tation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is no command-line option
to set the mainTranslations resource, since changing this
resource on the command line would be cumbersome. To set the
resource for testing pur&acirc; <br>
poses, use the -xrm command-line option provided by the X
toolkit. For example, xdvi -xrm
&rsquo;XDvi.mainTranslations: #override
&quot;z&quot;:quit()&rsquo; ... or xdvi -xrm
&rsquo;XDvi.mainTranslations: <br>
#override &lt;Key&gt;z:quit()&rsquo; ... will cause the key
&lsquo;z&rsquo; to quit xdvi.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some resources are provided to
allow customization of the geometry of the Xaw command
buttons. Again, they are not changeable via command-line
options, other than via the -xrm <br>
option. All of these resources take integer values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">buttonSideSpacing <br>
The number of pixels to be placed on either side of the
buttons. The default value is 6.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">buttonTopSpacing <br>
The number of pixels between the top button and the top of
the window. The default value is 50.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">buttonBetweenSpacing <br>
The number of pixels between the buttons. The default value
is 20.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">buttonBetweenExtra <br>
The number of pixels of additional space to be inserted if
the buttonTranslations resource string contains an extra
newline character. The default value is 50.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">buttonBorderWidth <br>
The border width of the button windows. The default value is
1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PAGE LIST <br>
The scrollable page list on the right of the main window
allows you to jump directly to a page in the DVI file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mouse-1 <br>
Jumps to the page the mouse is located on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mouse-2 <br>
[toggle-mark()] Toggle the mark of the current page. The
marks are used by the &lsquo;Print&rsquo; and &lsquo;Save to
file&rsquo; dialogs to select only marked pages from the DVI
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the mouse pointer is inside
the page list, the mouse wheel switches to the next or
previous page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SCROLLBARS <br>
The scrollbars (if present) behave in the standard way:
pushing Button 2 in a scrollbar moves the top or left edge
of the scrollbar to that point and optionally drags it;
push&acirc; <br>
ing Button 1 moves the image up or right by an amount equal
to the distance from the button press to the upper left-hand
corner of the window; pushing Button 3 moves the image <br>
down or left by the same amount.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The scrollbars can be removed
via the -expertmode flag/keystroke (which see).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MAGNIFIER <br>
By default, the mouse buttons 1 to 5 will pop up a
&lsquo;&lsquo;magnifying glass&rsquo;&rsquo; that shows an
unshrunken image of the page (i.e. an image at the
resolution determined by the option/X re&acirc; <br>
source pixels or mfmode) at varying sizes. When the
magnifier is moved, small ruler-like tick marks are
displayed at the edges of the magnifier (unless the X
resource delayRulers <br>
is set to false, in which case the tick marks will always be
displayed). The unit of the marks is determined by the X
resource tickUnits (mm by default). This unit can be <br>
changed at runtime via the action switch-magnifier-units(),
by default bound to the keystroke &lsquo;t&rsquo; (see the
description of that key, and of switch-magnifier-units() for
more de&acirc; <br>
tails on the units available). <br>
The length of the tick marks can be changed via the X
resource tickLength (4 by default). A zero or negative value
suppresses the tick marks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PAGE HISTORY <br>
Xdvi keeps a history of viewed pages, and you can move
through the history and delete items using the keys [
(pagehistory-back()), ] (pagehistory-forward()), Ctr-[
(pagehistory- <br>
delete-backward()) and Ctr-]
(pagehistory-delete-forward()).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When one of the history commands
is used, the page history is displayed in the status line at
the bottom of the window, with the current list item marked
by square brackets &lsquo;[&rsquo;, <br>
&lsquo;]&rsquo; and a left and right context of at most 10
items. File boundaries are marked by &lsquo;#&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The size of the history can be
customized with the X resource pageHistorySize (the default
size is 1000 items). If the size is set to 0, the history
commands are disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HYPERLINKS <br>
The actions do-href() and do-href-newwindow() (by default
bound to Mouse-1 and Mouse-2 if the pointer is currently
located on a hyperlink) can be used to open the link target
in <br>
the same window (do-href()) or in a new window
(do-href-newwindow()).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the link target is not a file
on the local disk, xdvi tries to launch a web browser (as
specified by the -browser command line option, the BROWSER
environment variable or the <br>
wwwBrowser X resource, in this order) to retrieve the
document. See the description of the BROWSER environment
variable, below, for an example setting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the file is a local file,
xdvi tries to determine if it is a DVI file. If it is, xdvi
will try to display the file; otherwise it will try to
determine the MIME type of the <br>
file, and from that an application suitable for opening the
file. This is done by parsing the files specified by the
environment variable EXTENSIONMAPS for a mapping of filename
<br>
extensions to MIME types, and the files determined by the
environment variable MAILCAPS for a mapping of MIME types to
application programs. See the descriptions of these
vari&acirc; <br>
ables in the section ENVIRONMENT, below, for a more detailed
description and the default values of these variables. If no
suitable files are found, a set of built-in default MIME
<br>
types and applications is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Xdvi currently uses no
heuristics apart from the filename suffix to determine the
mime type of a file. If a filename has no suffix, the value
of the resource noMimeSuffix is used <br>
(by default application/x-unknown). If the suffix
doesn&rsquo;t match any of the suffixes in mime.types, the
value of the resource unknownMimeSuffix is used (by default
application/x- <br>
unknown). If the mailcap entries do not list a viewer for a
given mime type, xdvi will show a warning popup. If you want
to avoid this warning, and for example want to always <br>
use the netscape browser for unknown MIME types, you could
add the following line to your ~/.mailcap file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">application/xdvi-unknown;
netscape -raise -remote
&rsquo;openURL(%s,new-window)&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STRING SEARCH <br>
The keystroke Ctrl-f or the menu entry File &gt; Find ...
(or the &lsquo;Binoculars&rsquo; symbol in the toolbar, for
Motif) opens a dialog window to search for a text string or
a regular ex&acirc; <br>
pression in the DVI file. The keystroke Ctrl-g jumps to the
next match (like pressing the &lsquo;Find&rsquo; button in
the search window).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, the matches are
highlighted in inverted color. If the display isn&rsquo;t
running in TrueColor, or if the X resource
matchHighlightInverted is set to false or the command- <br>
line option -nomatchinverted is used, xdvi will instead draw
a rectangle in highlight color (see the -hl option) around
the match.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a match crosses a page
boundary, only the part on the first page is highlighted.
Xdvi will scan up to 2 adjacent pages to match strings
crossing page boundaries; but note <br>
that header or footer lines, or intervening float pages will
be treated as parts of the scanned text. Such text will
usually cause multi-page matching to fail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This emphasizes the fact that
searching in the formatted text (the DVI output) works
differently from searching in the source text: Searching in
the DVI file makes it easier to <br>
skip formatting instructions, and makes it possible to
search for e.g. hyphenation and equation numbers; but
sometimes the formatting results can also get in the way,
e.g. in <br>
the case of footnotes. In these cases it&rsquo;s better to
search in the TeX source instead. The use of source specials
will make switching between the xdvi display and the editor
with <br>
the TeX source easier; see the section SOURCE SPECIALS below
for more information on this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The text extracted from the DVI
file is in encoded in UTF-8 (you can view that text by
saving the file in UTF-8 format via the File &gt; Save as
... menu item). If xdvi has been <br>
compiled with locale, nl_langinfo() and iconv support, the
search term is converted from the character set specified by
the current locale into UTF-8. (See the output of locale

-a for a list of locale settings available on your system).
If nl_langinfo() is not available, but iconv is, you can
specify the input encoding for iconv via the X resource
tex&acirc; <br>
tEncoding (see the output of iconv -l for a list of valid
encodings). If iconv support is not available, only the
encodings ISO-8859-1 and UTF-8 are supported (these names
are <br>
case-insensitive).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ideographic characters from CJKV
fonts are treated specially: All white space (spaces and
newlines) before and after such characters is ignored in the

DVI file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To match a newline character,
use in the search string; to match the string 0 use \n.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the checkbox Regular
Expression is activated, the string is treated as a regular
expression in extended POSIX syntax, with the following
properties:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- a? matches a zero or one
times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- a* matches a zero or more
times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- a+ matches a one or more
times. Note that * and + are greedy, i.e. they match the
longest possible substring.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- The pattern . matches any
character except for newline. To also match a newline, use
&lsquo;(.|0&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- a{n} matches a exactly n
times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- a{n,m} matches a at least n
and no more than m times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- a|b matches a or b. Brackets
can be used for grouping, e.g.: (a|b)|c.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- The string matched by the nth
group can be referenced by 0 e.g. 1 refers to the first
match.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- The characters ^ and $ match
the beginning and the end of a line, respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- [abc] matches any of the
letters a, b, c, and [a-z] matches all characters from a to
z.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Each item in a regular
expression can also be one of the following POSIX character
classes: <br>
[[:alnum:]] [[:alpha:]] [[:blank:]] [[:cntrl:]] [[:digit:]]
<br>
[[:graph:]] [[:lower:]] [[:print:]] [[:space:]]
[[:upper:]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These can be negated by
inserting a ^ symbol after the first bracket:
[^[:alpha:]]</p>

Test will match both the strings test and TEST in the DVI

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- ignore line breaks and
hyphens: This removes all hyphens at the ends of lines and
the following newline characters, and replaces all remaining
newline characters by white <br>
spaces. So hyphenated words will appear as one word to the
search, and a search for two words with a space in between
will also match the words if they are separated by a <br>
linebreak. <br>
Note that the hyphen removal may cause unwanted side effects
for compound words containing hyphens that are wrapped after
the hyphen, and that replacing the newlines affects <br>
the interpretation of regular expressions as follows: The .
pattern will also match newlines, and ^ and $ won&rsquo;t
match begin and end of lines any more. (Since currently
there <br>
is no option for turning off the greediness of * and +,
turning on this option will usually result in matches that
are longer than desired.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The current checkbox settings
are saved in the ~/.xdvirc file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PRINT DIALOG <br>
The print dialog window allows you to print all pages,
marked pages (click or drag Mouse-2 in the page list to mark
them), or a range of pages. Note that the page numbers
always <br>
refer to physical pages, so if you&rsquo;re using the option
&lsquo;use TeX pages&rsquo;, you may want to disable it to
make it easier to determine the correct page numbers (or
avoid this problem <br>
altogether by marking the pages to be printed).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The value of the Printer text
filed is passed to dvips via the -o! mechanism, as a single
argument after the &lsquo;!&rsquo;. Any arguments listed in
the Dvips options field are segmented <br>
at whitespaces and passed as separate arguments to dvips. If
you e.g. want to print the file 2-up, you should enter the
following string into the Printer field:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">psnup -2 -q | lpr -Plp</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are several resources for
customizing the behaviour and the default entries of the
print dialog:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dvipsPrinterString</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dvipsOptionsString <br>
These can be used to provide default entries for the Printer
and the Dvips options text fields, respectively. If no paper
size is specified in the DVI file (via e.g. <br>
sepackage[dvips]{geometry} - this is the preferred method),
the input field is initialized with the current value of the
command line option/X resource paper. E.g., the <br>
option -paper a4r is translated into the dvips options -t a4
-t landscape. Note that no check is performed whether dvips
actually understands these options (it will ig&acirc; <br>
nore them if it can&rsquo;t); currently not all options used
by xdvi are also covered by dvips.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dvipsHangTime</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dvipsFailHangTime <br>
These specify the time (in milliseconds) that the printing
progress window will stay open after the dvips process has
terminated. The value of dvipsHangTime is used if the <br>
process terminates successfully; dvipsFailHangTime is used
if it terminates with an error. The default values are 1.5
and 5 seconds, respectively. If both values are neg&acirc;
<br>
ative, the window will stay open until it is closed by the
user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SAVE DIALOG <br>
This dialog allows you to save all or selected/marked pages
in the current DVI file. You can save in one of the
following formats:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Postscript (uses dvips to
convert the DVI file to a Postscript file, just like when
printing to a Postscript file).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- PDF (first uses dvips to
convert the DVI file to a Postscript file, then uses ps2pdf
to convert the Postscript file to PDF).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Plain text in ISO-8859-1 or
UTF-8 encoding. The latter will preserve more of the special
LaTeX characters e.g. from mathematical mode. Note however
that e.g. only few of La&acirc; <br>
TeX&rsquo;s mathematical symbols can be rendered correctly
as text; so this funcionality works best for plain text
documents. If a character cannot be displayed in the
selected <br>
charset, it is replaced by &lsquo;&acute; followed by the
hexadecimal character code. If a character is not recognized
at all, it is replaced by &lsquo;?&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The programs for Postscript and
PDF conversion can be customized via the command line
options or X resources -dvipspath/.dvipsPath and
-ps2pdfpath/.ps2pdfPath, respectively; see <br>
the explanation of these options above for more details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MODES <br>
The keystroke Ctrl-m [switch-mode()] switches between three
different mouse bindings, which can also be activated via
the Modes menu (in Motif, this is a submenu of the Options
<br>
menu called Mouse Mode). The default mode at startup can be
customized via the X resource mouseMode or the command-line
option -mousemode. The default startup mode is Magnifier
<br>
Mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: The modes are implemented
by changing the magnifier() action. Switching the mode will
not work if Mouse-1 has been customized to an action
sequence that does not contain <br>
the magnifier() action.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Magnifier Mode <br>
In this mode, the mouse buttons 1 to 5 pop up a
&lsquo;&lsquo;magnifying glass&rsquo;&rsquo; that shows an
unshrunken image of the page (i.e. an image at the
resolution determined by the option/X <br>
resource pixels or mfmode) at varying sizes. When the
magnifier is moved, small ruler-like tick marks are
displayed at the edges of the magnifier (unless the X
resource <br>
delayRulers is set to false, in which case the tick marks
are always displayed). The unit of the marks is determined
by the X resource tickUnits (mm by default). This <br>
unit can be changed at runtime via the action
switch-magnifier-units(), by default bound to the keystroke
&lsquo;t&rsquo; (see the description of that key, and of
switch-magnifier- <br>
units() for more details on the units available). <br>
The length of the tick marks can be changed via the X
resource tickLength (4 by default). A zero or negative value
suppresses the tick marks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Text Selection Mode <br>
This mode allows you to select a rectangular region of text
in the DVI file by holding down Mouse-1 and moving the
mouse. The text is put into the X primary selection so <br>
that it can be pasted into other X applications with Mouse-2
as usual. <br>
If xdvi has been compiled with locale, nl_langinfo() and
iconv support, the selected text is converted into the
character set of the current locale (see the output of
lo&acirc; <br>
cale -a for a list of locale settings available on your
system). If nl_langinfo() is not available, but iconv is,
you can specify the input encoding for iconv via the X <br>
resource textEncoding (see the output of iconv -l for a list
of valid encodings). If iconv support is not available, only
the encodings ISO-8859-1 and UTF-8 are supported <br>
(these names are case-insensitive). <br>
Note that UTF-8 is the only encoding that can render all
characters (e.g. mathematical symbols) of a DVI file. If
ISO-8859-1 is active, characters that cannot be displayed
<br>
are replaced by &lsquo;&acute; followed by the hexadecimal
character code. For other encodings, such characters may
trigger iconv error messages. If a character is not
recognized <br>
at all, it is replaced by &lsquo;?&rsquo;. <br>
To extract larger portions of text, you can alternatively
save selected pages or the entire file in text format via
the File &gt; Save as ... menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ruler Mode <br>
This mode provides a simple way of measuring distances on
the page. <br>
When this mode is activated, the mouse cursor changes into a
thin cross, and a larger, cross-shaped ruler is drawn in the
highlight color at the mouse location. The ruler <br>
doesn&rsquo;t have units attached to it; instead, the
current distance between the ruler and the mouse cursor is
continuously printed to the statusline. <br>
When activating Ruler Mode, the ruler is at first attached
to the mouse and can be moved around. It can then be
positioned at a fixed place by clicking Mouse-1. After <br>
that, the mouse cursor can be moved to measure the
horizontal (dx), vertical (dy) and direct (shortest) (dr)
distance between the ruler center point and the mouse. <br>
Clicking Mouse-1 again will move the ruler to the current
mouse position, and holding down Mouse-1 will drag the ruler
around. <br>
In Ruler Mode, the following special keybindings extend or
replace the default bindings:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o [ruler-snap-origin()] Snap the
ruler back to the origin coordinate (0,0).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">t [overrides
switch-magnifier-units()] Toggle between various ruler
units, which can be specified by the X resource tickUnits
(&lsquo;mm&rsquo; by default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">P [overrides
declare-page-number()] Print the distances shown in the
statusline to standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TOOLBAR (Motif only) <br>
The Motif toolbar can also be customized. The XPM file used
for the toolbar icons can be specified via the resource
toolbarPixmapFile, which should contain a filename that can
be <br>
found in one of XFILESEARCHPATH or XDVIINPUTS (see the
section FILE SEARCHING below for more information on these
variables). Xdvi will try to split this pixmap horizontally
in&acirc; <br>
to n pieces, where each piece is as wide as the pixmap is
high and is treated as an image for toolbar button n. This
means that each icon should be a square, and that the entire
<br>
pixmap should have width n x h if h is the height of the
pixmap.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The resource toolbarTranslations
can be used to map icons/buttons to specific actions. The
resource should contain a string separated by newline
characters, similar to the re&acirc; <br>
sources mainTranslations and menuTranslations. Every line
must contain either a spacer definition, or an icon
definition:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A spacer definition is a string
SPACER(n), where n is the number of pixels inserted as
separator to the following button.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An icon definition is a
colon-separated list containing the following elements:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- the index of an icon in the
pixmap file (starting from zero);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- a long tooltip string,
displayed in the status area;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- a short tooltip string,
displayed as popup;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- a sequence of actions to be
performed when the corresponding toolbar button is
pushed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To illustrate this, the default
value of toolbarTranslations looks as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xdvi.toolbarTranslations:
SPACER(5) 0:Open a new document (Key\: Ctrl-f): Open
file:select-dvi-file() SPACER(10) 1:Reread this document

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the mouse remains over a
toolbar button for a certain period, a &lsquo;tooltip&rsquo;
window is shown, describing what the button does using the
short tooltip string from the above re&acirc; <br>
source. At the same time, the long tooltip string is
displayed in the statusline. The appearance and behaviour of
these tooltips can be customized via the following
resources:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tipShell.background <br>
Background color of the tooltip window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tipShell.fontSet <br>
Font used for the tooltip.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tipShell.waitPeriod <br>
The time (in milliseconds) the mouse pointer needs to be
over the button before the tooltip is shown. Set it to a
negative value to suppress the tooltips altogether.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GREYSCALING AND COLORMAPS <br>
The greyscale anti-aliasing feature in xdvi will not work at
its best if the display does not have enough colors
available. This can happen if other applications are using
most <br>
of the colormap (even if they are iconified). If this
occurs, then xdvi will print an error message and turn on
the -copy option. This will result in overstrike characters
ap&acirc; <br>
pearing wrong; it may also result in poor display quality if
the number of available colors is very small.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Typically this problem occurs on
displays that allocate eight bits of video memory per pixel.
To see how many bits per pixel your display uses, type
xwininfo in an xterm window, <br>
and then click the mouse on the root window when asked. The
&lsquo;&lsquo;Depth:&rsquo;&rsquo; entry will tell you how
many bits are allocated per pixel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Displays using at least 15 bits
per pixel are typically TrueColor visuals, which do not have
this problem, since their colormap is permanently allocated
and available to all ap&acirc; <br>
plications. (The visual class is also displayed by
xwininfo.) For more information on visual classes see the
documentation for the X Window System.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To alleviate this problem,
therefore, one may (a) run with more bits per pixel (this
may require adding more video memory or replacing the video
card), (b) shut down other appli&acirc; <br>
cations that may be using much of the colormap and then
restart xdvi, or (c) run xdvi with the -install option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One application which is often
the cause of this problem is Netscape. In this case there
are two more alternatives to remedying the situation. One
can run &lsquo;&lsquo;netscape -install&rsquo;&rsquo; <br>
to cause Netscape to install a private colormap. This can
cause colors to change in bizarre ways when the mouse is
moved to a different window. Or, one can run
&lsquo;&lsquo;netscape <br>
-ncols 220&rsquo;&rsquo; to limit Netscape to a smaller
number of colors. A smaller number will ensure that other
applications have more colors available, but will degrade
the color quality <br>
in the Netscape window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HANDLING OF POSTSCRIPT FIGURES
<br>
Xdvi can display Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) files
included in the dvi file. Such files are first searched for
in the directory where the dvi file is, and then using
normal <br>
Kpathsea rules. There is an exception to this, however: if
the file name begins with a backtick (&lsquo;), then the
remaining characters in the file name give a shell command
(often <br>
zcat) which is executed; its standard output is then sent to
be interpreted as PostScript. Since the execution of
arbitrary shell commands with the user&rsquo;s permissions
is a huge <br>
security risk, evaluation of these backtick commands is
disabled by default. It needs to be activated via the
-allowshell command-line option. NOTE: You should never use
this <br>
option when viewing documents that you didn&rsquo;t compile
yourself. The backtick specials are not needed for
uncompressing gzipped Postscript files, since xdvi can do
that on the fly <br>
if the filename ends with .eps.gz or .eps.Z (and if the
first bytes of the file indicate that the file is indeed
compressed). This is both safer and more flexible than the
back&acirc; <br>
tick approach, since the default file searching rules will
apply to such filenames too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">T1LIB <br>
Using T1Lib, a library written by Rainer Menzner (see
ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/libs/graphics/), xdvi can
render Postscript&lt;tm&gt; Type1 fonts directly, without
the route via <br>
TeX pixel (pk) fonts. The advantage of this is that only one
size of each font needs to be stored on disk. Unless the
-not1lib option is used, xdvi will try to render every font
<br>
using T1Lib. Only as a fallback it will invoke an external
program (like mktexpk, which in turn may invoke utilities
like ps2pk or gsftopk) to generate a pixel font from the
<br>
Type1 source. The direct rendering of the Computer Modern
fonts should work out-of-the box, whereas other Type1 fonts
such as the 35 &lsquo;standard&rsquo; Postscript&lt;tm&gt;
fonts resident in <br>
printers may need to be made accessible for use with xdvi,
unless your system administrator or TeX distribution has
already done so (which is the case e.g. for current teTeX
sys&acirc; <br>
tems). The xdvik distribution comes with a utility called
t1mapper to make these fonts available for xdvi; see the
manual page for t1mapper(1) for usage details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SPECIALS (GENERALLY) <br>
Any of the specials used by xdvi may be preceded by the
characters &lsquo;&lsquo;xdvi:&rsquo;&rsquo;. Doing so does
not change the behavior of the special under xdvi, but it
tells other dvi drivers <br>
(such as e.g. dvips) to ignore the special.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SOURCE SPECIALS <br>
Some TeX implementations or macro packages provide the
facility to automatically include so-called &lsquo;source
specials&rsquo; into a DVI file. These contain the line
number, eventually a <br>
column number, and the filename of the .tex source. This
makes it possible to jump from a .dvi file to the
corresponding place in the .tex source and vice versa (also
called &lsquo;in&acirc; <br>
verse search&rsquo; - jumping from the DVI file to the TeX
file is also known as &lsquo;reverse search&rsquo;, and
jumping from the TeX file to the DVI file as &lsquo;forward
search&rsquo;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To be usable with xdvi, source
specials in the dvi file must have one of the following
formats:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">src:line[ ]filename <br>
src:line:col[ ]filename <br>
src:line <br>
src:line:col <br>
src::col</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If filename or line are omitted,
the most recent values are used. The first source special on
each page must be in one of the first two forms, since
defaults are not inherited <br>
across pages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You will need a TeX
implementation that provides an appropriate switch (e.g.
-src) or a macro package (such as srcltx.sty or srctex.sty,
available from CTAN:macros/latex/con&acirc; <br>
trib/supported/srcltx/) to insert such source specials into
the DVI file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For reverse search, the
combination Ctrl-Mouse 1 will make xdvi open an editor (the
value of the -editor command line option) with the file and
the line number of the .tex <br>
source. See the description of the -editor option for more
information and example settings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For forward search, xdvi has a
-sourceposition option that makes xdvi jump to the page in
the DVI file corresponding to the given line (or the closest
line having a source spe&acirc; <br>
cial) of the specified file and highlight the found region.
See the description of the -sourceposition option for more
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">More information on setting up
various editors for use with source specials can be found
at:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">http://xdvi.sourceforge.net/inverse-search.html</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PAPERSIZE SPECIALS <br>
xdvi accepts specials to set the paper size for the
document. These specials should be of the form</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">papersize=[*]width,height</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where width and height give the
width and height of the paper, respectively. Each of these
should appear in the form of a decimal number followed by
any of the two-letter abbre&acirc; <br>
viations for units accepted by TeX (pt, pc, in, bp, cm, mm,
dd, cc, or sp). If an asterisk (*) appears just before the
width, then the measurements refer to the document
dimen&acirc; <br>
sions (e.g., pt as opposed to truept). This allows a macro
package to vary the page size according to elements of the
document; e.g.,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cial{xdvi: papersize=*0mber168
<br>
0mberox sp}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Except for the asterisk, this
format is compatible with dvips.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The last papersize special on a
page determines the size of that page. If there is no such
special on a given page, the most recent papersize is used,
or, if there are no paper&acirc; <br>
size specials on any preceding page, then the value of the
paper resource (or -paper option on the command line) is
used. Thus the paper size may vary for different pages of
the <br>
dvi file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the paper resource (or -paper
command-line option) begins with a plus sign
(&lsquo;+&rsquo;), then all papersize specials in the dvi
file are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COLOR SPECIALS <br>
The color specials supported by xdvi are the same as those
supported by dvips, except that the literal PostScript color
specification (as in the AggiePattern example in the dvips
<br>
documentation) is not supported. There are also some
restrictions due to the way xdvi&rsquo;s drawing routines
are implemented; e.g. the with xdvi. See the section
LIMITATIONS below for more information on these
restrictions. Xdvi supports the same list of named colors as
dvips does, namely:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Apricot, Aquamarine,

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that these names are case
sensitive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The documentation of the LaTeX
color package provides more details on how to use such
specials with LaTeX; see the dvips documentation for a
detailed description of the syntax <br>
and semantics of the color specials.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGNALS <br>
When xdvi receives a SIGUSR1 signal, it rereads the dvi
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
Xdvik uses the same environment variables and algorithms for
searching for font files as TeX and friends. See the
documentation for the Kpathsea library, kpathsea.dvi, for a
de&acirc; <br>
tailed description of these.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition, xdvik accepts the
following variables:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DISPLAY <br>
Specifies which graphics display terminal to use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KPATHSEA_DEBUG <br>
Trace Kpathsea lookups; set it to -1 (= all bits on) for
complete tracing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTENSIONMAPS <br>
A list of files to be searched for mime types entries (as
for Acrobat Reader). Earlier entries in one of these files
override later ones. If this variable is not set, <br>
the following default path is used:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">$HOME/.mime.types:/etc/mime.types:
/usr/etc/mime.types:/usr/local/etc/mime.types</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MAILCAPS <br>
A list of files to be searched for mailcap entries, as
defined by RFC 1343. See this RFC or the mailcap(4) manual
page for a detailed description of the mailcap file
for&acirc; <br>
mat. Currently, only the following mailcap features are
supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">test=command <br>
The entry is only used if command can be executed via the
system() call and if the system() call returns with value 0
(success). The command string may contain the <br>
format string %s, which will be replaced by the file
name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">needsterminal <br>
If this flag is used, the command will be executed in a new
xterm window by prepending &lsquo;&lsquo;xterm -e
&rsquo;&rsquo; to the command string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All other fields in the mailcap
entry are ignored by xdvi. Earlier entries in one of these
files override later ones. If the variable is not defined,
the following de&acirc; <br>
fault path is used:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">$HOME/.mailcap:/etc/mailcap:/usr/etc/mailcap:
/usr/local/etc/mailcap</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For security reasons, some
special characters (i.e.: ( ) &lsquo; &nbsp;;) are escaped
in the argument before passing it to system().</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BROWSER <br>
Determines the web browser used to open external links
(i.e., all URLs that don&rsquo;t start with the
&lsquo;file:&rsquo; scheme and are not relative links in the
local DVI file), and to <br>
open links for which no viewer has been specified in the
mailcap files. The value of this variable is a
colon-separated list of commands. Xdvi will try each of them
in se&acirc; <br>
quence until one succeeds (i.e. doesn&rsquo;t immediately
return with status 0). This allows you to specify your
favourite browser at the beginning, and fallback browsers at
the <br>
end. Every occurrence of %s in the string is replaced by the
target URL; every occurrence of %% is replaced by a single
%. If no %s is present, the URL string is added as <br>
an extra argument. <br>
An example setting is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">netscape -raise -remote
&rsquo;openURL(%s,new-window)&rsquo;:xterm -e lynx %s:xterm
-e wget %s:lynx %s:wget %s</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">for more details on the BROWSER
environment variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TMPDIR The directory to use for
storing temporary files created when uncompressing
PostScript files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">XEDITOR <br>
Determines the editor command used for source special
&lsquo;reverse search&rsquo;, if neither the -editor
command-line option nor the .editor resource are specified.
See the de&acirc; <br>
scription of the -editor command line option for details on
the format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VISUAL Determines an editor to
be opened in an xterm window if neither of -editor, .editor,
or XEDITOR is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EDITOR Determines an editor to
be opened in an xterm window if neither of -editor, .editor,
XEDITOR or VISUAL is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WWWBROWSER <br>
Obsolete; use BROWSER instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LIMITATIONS <br>
xdvi accepts many but not all types of PostScript specials
accepted by dvips. For example, it accepts most specials
generated by epsf and psfig. It does not, however, support
<br>
bop-hook or eop-hook, nor does it allow PostScript commands
to affect the rendering of things that are not PostScript
(for example, the &lsquo;&lsquo;NEAT&rsquo;&rsquo; and
rotated &lsquo;&lsquo;A&rsquo;&rsquo; examples in the <br>
dvips manual). These restrictions are due to the design of
xdvi; in all likelihood they will always remain.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LaTeX2e rotation specials are
currently not supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MetaPost files containing
included text are not supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Xdvi&rsquo;s color handling
doesn&rsquo;t support the by the colortbl package) may
render incorrectly: Text in colors different from the
default foreground color may not be displayed. When the page
is redrawn (e.g. after using the <br>
magnifier), the background color of the cells may overdraw
the text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
$HOME/.xdvirc <br>
A file that holds all settings that the user changed via the
keys, the &lsquo;Options&rsquo; and the Xaw
&lsquo;Modes&rsquo; menu and the dialogs, as X resources.
These resources override the <br>
settings in $HOME/.Xdefaults. This file is ignored if the -q
option is used or the noInitFile X resource is set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xdvi.cfg <br>
A configuration file for the T1 font setup which needs to be
supplied in the directory determined by the XDVIINPUTS
environment variable. Please see the file http://xd&acirc;
<br>
vi.sourceforge.net/README.t1fonts if that file is
missing.</p>
