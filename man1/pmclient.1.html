<p>PMCLIENT(1) General Commands Manual PMCLIENT(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pmclient, pmclient_fg - a simple performance metrics
client</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pmclient [-a archive] [-h host] [-n pmnsfile] [-P] [-S
numsec] [-s samples] [-t interval] [-Z timezone] [-z]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
pmclient and pmclient_fg are simple clients that use the
Performance Metrics Application Programming Interface
(PMAPI) to report some high-level system performance
metrics.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The real value of these tools is
as sample clients using the PMAPI(3), interfaces and to this
end the source code is included with the Performance
Co-Pilot (PCP) package (see <br>
PCPIntro(1)), and is typically installed in
/usr/share/pcp/demos/pmclient.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The pmclient_fg program differs
to pmclient in that it uses the fetchgroup API extension to
the PMAPI, see pmFetchGroup(3).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normally pmclient operates on
the distributed Performance Metrics Name Space (PMNS),
however if the -n option is specified an alternative local
PMNS is loaded from the file pmns&acirc; <br>
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unless directed to another host
by the -h option, or to an archive by the -a option,
pmclient will contact the Performance Metrics Collector
Daemon (PMCD) on the local host to <br>
obtain the required information. The argument to -a is a
comma-separated list of names, each of which may be the base
name of an archive or the name of a directory containing
<br>
one or more archives. The -a and -h options are mutually
exclusive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, pmclient reports the
time of day according to the local timezone on the system
where pmclient is run. The -Z option changes the timezone to
timezone in the format of <br>
the environment variable TZ as described in environ(7). The
-z option changes the timezone to the local timezone at the
host that is the source of the performance metrics, as <br>
identified via either the -h or -a options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other options control the
specific information to be reported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P The default behavior for
replaying a set of archives, is to replay at full speed. The
-P option may be used in conjunction with a set of archives,
to request that the <br>
prevailing real-time delay be applied between samples (see
-t) to effect a pause.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S numsec <br>
The -S option may be used in conjunction with a set of
archives to request that display start at the time numsec
seconds from the start of the set of archives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s samples <br>
The argument samples defines the number of samples to be
retrieved and reported. If samples is 0 or -s is not
specified, pmclient will sample and report continuously (in
<br>
real time mode) or until the end of the set of PCP archives
(in archive mode).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t interval <br>
The default update interval may be set to something other
than the default 5 seconds. The interval argument follows
the syntax described in PCPIntro(1), and in the sim&acirc;
<br>
plest form may be an unsigned integer (the implied units in
this case are seconds).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The output from pmclient is
directed to standard output, and lists</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+ Aggregate CPU utilization, in
the range 0 to 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+ If the system has more than 1
CPU, the ordinal number of the busiest CPU, in the range 0
to ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+ If the system has more than 1
CPU, the CPU utilization for the busiest CPU.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+ Real free memory in
Mbytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+ Aggregate physical disk I/O
operations per second (IOPS).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+ Load average over the last 1
minute and over the last 15 minutes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
$PCP_DEMOS_DIR/pmclient <br>
source code, documentation, configuration files and Makefile
when the PCP development package is installed</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PCP ENVIRONMENT <br>
Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP. On
each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local
<br>
values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF variable may be
used to specify an alternative configuration file, as
described in pcp.conf(5).</p>
