<p>GNUNET-PUBLISH(1) General Commands Manual
GNUNET-PUBLISH(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
gnunet-publish - a command line interface for publishing new
content into GNUnet</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
gnunet-publish [OPTIONS] FILENAME</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
In order to share files with other GNUnet users, the files
must first be made available to GNUnet. GNUnet does not
automatically share all files from a certain directory
(how&acirc; <br>
ever, you can do this with the gnunet-auto-share tool). In
fact, even files that are downloaded are not automatically
shared.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to start sharing files,
the files must be added either using gnunet-publish or a
graphical interface such as gnunet-fs-gtk. The command line
tool gnunet-publish is more <br>
useful if many files are supposed to be added.
gnunet-publish can automatically publish batches of files,
recursively publish directories, create directories that can
be browsed <br>
within GNUnet and publish file lists in a namespace. When
run on a directory, gnunet-publish will always recursively
publish all of the files in the directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gnunet-publish can automatically
extract keywords from the files that are shared. Users that
want to download files from GNUnet use keywords to search
for the appropriate con&acirc; <br>
tent. You can disable keyword extraction with the -D option.
You can manually add keywords using the -k option. The
keywords are case-sensitive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition to searching for
files by keyword, GNUnet allows organizing files into
directories. With directories, the user only needs to find
the directory in order to be able <br>
to download any of the files listed in the directory.
Directories can contain pointers to other directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With gnunet-publish, it is easy
to create new directories simultaneously when adding the
files. Simply pass the name of a directory instead of a
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since keywords can be spammed
(any user can add any content under any keyword), GNUnet
supports namespaces. A namespace is a subset of the
searchspace into which only the holder <br>
of a certain pseudonym can add content. Any GNUnet user can
create any number of pseudonyms using gnunet-pseudonym.
Pseudonyms are stored in the user&rsquo;s GNUnet directory.
While <br>
pseudonyms are locally identified with an arbitrary string
that the user selects when the pseudonym is created, the
namespace is globally known only under the hash of the
public <br>
key of the pseudonym. Since only the owner of the pseudonym
can add content to the namespace, it is impossible for other
users to pollute the namespace. gnunet-publish
automati&acirc; <br>
cally publishes the top-directory (or the only file if only
one file is specified) into the namespace if a pseudonym is
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is possible to update content
in GNUnet if that content was placed and obtained from a
particular namespace. Updates are only possible for content
in namespaces since this is <br>
the only way to assure that a malicious party can not supply
counterfeited updates. Note that an update with GNUnet does
not make the old content unavailable, GNUnet merely <br>
allows the publisher to point users to more recent versions.
You can use the -N option to specify the future identifier
of an update. When using this option, a GNUnet client <br>
that finds the current (-t) identifier will automatically
begin a search for the update (-N) identifier. If you later
publish an update under the (-N) identifier, both results
<br>
will be given to the user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can use automatic meta-data
extraction (based on libextractor) or the command-line
option -m to specify meta-data. For the -m option you need
to use the form key&acirc; <br>
word-type:value. For example, use &quot;-m os:Linux&quot; to
specify that the operating system is Linux. Common meta-data
types are &quot;author&quot;, &quot;title&quot; ,
&quot;mimetype&quot;, &quot;filename&quot;, &quot;lan&acirc;
<br>
guage&quot;, &quot;subject&quot; and &quot;keywords&quot;. A
full list can be obtained from the extract tool using the
option --list. The meta-data is used to help users in
searching for files on the <br>
network. The keywords are case-sensitive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GNUnet supports two styles of
publishing files on the network. Publishing a file means
that a copy of the file is made in the local (!) database of
the node. Indexing a file <br>
means that an index is added to the local (!) database with
symbolic links to the file itself. The links will use the
SHA-512 hash of the entire file as the filename. Indexing
<br>
is generally significantly more efficient and the default
choice. However, indexing only works if the indexed file can
be read (using the same absolute path) by gnunet-service-
<br>
fs. If this is not the case, indexing will fail (and
gnunet-publish will automatically revert to publishing
instead). Regardless of which method is used to publish the
file, <br>
the file will be slowly (depending on how often it is
requested and on how much bandwidth is available) dispersed
into the network. If you publish or index a file and then
leave <br>
the network, it will almost always NOT be available
anymore.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c FILENAME, --config=FILENAME
Use alternate config file (if this option is not specified,
the default is ~/.config/gnunet.conf).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D, --disable-extractor <br>
Disable use of GNU libextractor for finding additional
keywords and metadata.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e, --extract <br>
Print the list of keywords that will be used for each file
given the current options. Do not perform any indexing or
publishing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Print a brief help page with all the options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k KEYWORD, --key=KEYWORD <br>
additional key to index the content with (to add multiple
keys, specify multiple times). Each additional key is
case-sensitive. Can be specified multiple times. The
key&acirc; <br>
word is only applied to the top-level file or directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L LOGLEVEL, --loglevel=LOGLEVEL
<br>
Change the loglevel. Possible values for LOGLEVEL are ERROR,
WARNING, INFO and DEBUG.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m TYPE:VALUE, --meta=TYPE:VALUE
<br>
For the main file (or directory), set the metadata of the
given TYPE to the given VALUE. Note that this will not add
the respective VALUE to the set of keywords under <br>
which the file can be found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --noindex <br>
Executive summary: You probably don&rsquo;t need it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Do not index, full publishing.
Note that directories, RBlocks, SBlocks and IBlocks are
always published (even without this option). With this
option, every block of the <br>
actual files is stored in encrypted form in the block
database of the local peer. While this adds security if the
local node is compromised (the adversary snags your <br>
machine), it is significantly less efficient compared to
on-demand encryption and is definitely not recommended for
large files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N ID, --next=ID <br>
Specifies the next ID of a future version of the SBlock.
This option is only valid together with the -P option. This
option can be used to specify what the identifier of <br>
an updated version will look like. Note that specifying -i
and -N without -t is not allowed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p PRIORITY, --prio=PRIORITY
<br>
Executive summary: You probably don&rsquo;t need it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Set the priority of the
published content (default: 365). If the local database is
full, GNUnet will discard the content with the lowest
ranking. Note that ranks change <br>
over time depending on popularity. The default should be
high enough to preserve the locally published content in
favor of content that migrates from other peers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P NAME, --pseudonym=NAME <br>
For the top-level directory or file, create an SBlock that
places the file into the namespace specified by the
pseudonym NAME.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r LEVEL, --replication=LEVEL
<br>
Set the desired replication level. If CONTENT_PUSHING is set
to YES, GNUnet will push each block (for the file) LEVEL
times to other peers before doing normal &quot;random&quot;
<br>
replication of all content. This option can be used to push
some content out into the network harder. Note that pushing
content LEVEL times into the network does not <br>
guarantee that there will actually be LEVEL replicas.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --simulate-only <br>
When this option is used, gnunet-publish will not actually
publish the file but just simulate what would be done. This
can be used to compute the GNUnet URI for a file <br>
without actually sharing it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t ID, --this=ID <br>
Specifies the ID of the SBlock. This option is only valid
together with the -s option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u URI, --uri=URI <br>
This option can be used to specify the URI of a file instead
of a filename (this is the only case where the otherwise
mandatory filename argument must be omitted). <br>
Instead of publishing a file or directory and using the
corresponding URI, gnunet-publish will use this URI and
perform the selected namespace or keyword operations. This
<br>
can be used to add additional keywords to a file that has
already been shared or to add files to a namespace for which
the URI is known but the content is not locally <br>
available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --version <br>
Print the version number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --verbose <br>
Be verbose. Using this option causes gnunet-publish to print
progress information and at the end the file identification
that can be used to download the file from <br>
GNUnet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SETTING ANONYMITY LEVEL <br>
The -a option can be used to specify additional anonymity
constraints. If set to 0, GNUnet will publish the file
non-anonymously and in fact sign the advertisement for the
file <br>
using your peer&rsquo;s private key. This will allow other
users to download the file as fast as possible, including
using non-anonymous methods (DHT, direct transfer). If you
set it <br>
to 1 (default), you use the standard anonymous routing
algorithm (which does not explicitly leak your identity).
However, a powerful adversary may still be able to perform
traf&acirc; <br>
fic analysis (statistics) to over time infer data about your
identity. You can gain better privacy by specifying a higher
level of anonymity, which increases the amount of cover <br>
traffic your own traffic will get, at the expense of
performance. Note that regardless of the anonymity level you
choose, peers that cache content in the network always use
<br>
anonymity level 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The definition of the ANONYMITY
LEVEL is the following. 0 means no anonymity is required.
Otherwise a value of &rsquo;v&rsquo; means that 1 out of v
bytes of &quot;anonymous&quot; traffic can be <br>
from the local user, leaving &rsquo;v-1&rsquo; bytes of
cover traffic per byte on the wire. Thus, if GNUnet routes n
bytes of messages from foreign peers (using anonymous
routing), it may <br>
originate n/(v-1) bytes of data in the same time-period. The
time-period is twice the average delay that GNUnet defers
forwarded queries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is 1 and this should
be fine for most users. Also notice that if you choose very
large values, you may end up having no throughput at all,
especially if many of your <br>
fellow GNUnet-peers all do the same.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Basic examples</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Index a file COPYING:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># gnunet-publish COPYING</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Publish a file COPYING:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># gnunet-publish -n COPYING</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Index a file COPYING with the
keywords gpl and test:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># gnunet-publish -k gpl -k test
COPYING</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Index a file COPYING with
description &quot;GNU License&quot;, mime-type
&quot;text/plain&quot; and keywords gpl and test:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># gnunet-publish -m
&quot;description:GNU License&quot; -k gpl -k test -m
&quot;mimetype:text/plain&quot; COPYING</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using directories</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Index the files COPYING and
AUTHORS with keyword test and build a directory containing
the two files. Make the directory itself available under
keyword gnu and disable keyword <br>
extraction using libextractor:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># mkdir gnu <br>
# mv COPYING AUTHORS gnu/ <br>
# gnunet-publish -K test -k gnu -D gnu/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Neatly publish an image gallery
in kittendir/ and its subdirs with keyword kittens for the
directory but no keywords for the individual files or
subdirs (-n). Force description <br>
for all files:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># gnunet-publish -n -m
&quot;description:Kitten collection&quot; -k kittens
kittendir/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Secure publishing with
namespaces</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Publish file COPYING with
pseudonym RIAA-2 (-P) and with identifier gpl (-t) and no
updates:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># gnunet-publish -P RIAA-2 -t
gpl COPYING</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Recursively index /home/ogg and
build a matching directory structure. Publish the top-level
directory into the namespace under the pseudonym RIAA-2 (-P)
under identifier &rsquo;MUSIC&rsquo; <br>
(-t) and promise to provide an update with identifier
&rsquo;VIDEOS&rsquo; (-N):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># gnunet-publish -P RIAA-2 -t
MUSIC -N VIDEOS /home/ogg</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Recursively publish (-n)
/var/lib/mysql and build a matching directory structure, but
disable the use of libextractor to extract keywords (-n).
Print the file identifiers (-V) <br>
that can be used to retrieve the files. This will store a
copy of the MySQL database in GNUnet but without adding any
keywords to search for it. Thus only people that have been
<br>
told the secret file identifiers printed with the -V option
can retrieve the (secret?) files:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># gnunet-publish -nV
/var/lib/mysql</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Create a namespace entry
&rsquo;root&rsquo; in namespace MPAA-1 and announce that the
next update will be called &rsquo;next&rsquo;:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># gnunet-publish -P MPAA-1 -t
root -N next noise.mp3</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Update the previous entry, do
not allow any future updates:</p>
