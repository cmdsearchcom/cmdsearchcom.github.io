<p>PERLSYN(1) Perl Programmers Reference Guide
PERLSYN(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
perlsyn - Perl syntax</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
A Perl program consists of a sequence of declarations and
statements which run from the top to the bottom. Loops,
subroutines, and other control structures allow you to jump
<br>
around within the code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl is a free-form language:
you can format and indent it however you like. Whitespace
serves mostly to separate tokens, unlike languages like
Python where it is an important <br>
part of the syntax, or Fortran where it is immaterial.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Many of Perl&rsquo;s syntactic
elements are optional. Rather than requiring you to put
parentheses around every function call and declare every
variable, you can often leave such <br>
explicit elements off and Perl will figure out what you
meant. This is known as Do What I Mean, abbreviated DWIM. It
allows programmers to be lazy and to code in a style with
<br>
which they are comfortable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl borrows syntax and concepts
from many languages: awk, sed, C, Bourne Shell, Smalltalk,
Lisp and even English. Other languages have borrowed syntax
from Perl, particularly <br>
its regular expression extensions. So if you have programmed
in another language you will see familiar pieces in Perl.
They often work the same, but see perltrap for <br>
information about how they differ.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Declarations <br>
The only things you need to declare in Perl are report
formats and subroutines (and sometimes not even
subroutines). A scalar variable holds the undefined value
(&quot;undef&quot;) until <br>
it has been assigned a defined value, which is anything
other than &quot;undef&quot;. When used as a number,
&quot;undef&quot; is treated as 0; when used as a string, it
is treated as the empty <br>
string, &quot;&quot;; and when used as a reference that
isn&rsquo;t being assigned to, it is treated as an error. If
you enable warnings, you&rsquo;ll be notified of an
uninitialized value whenever <br>
you treat &quot;undef&quot; as a string or a number. Well,
usually. Boolean contexts, such as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if ($a) {}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">are exempt from warnings
(because they care about truth rather than definedness).
Operators such as &quot;++&quot;, &quot;--&quot;,
&quot;+=&quot;, &quot;-=&quot;, and &quot;.=&quot;, that
operate on undefined variables such <br>
as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">undef $a; <br>
$a++;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">are also always exempt from such
warnings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A declaration can be put
anywhere a statement can, but has no effect on the execution
of the primary sequence of statements: declarations all take
effect at compile time. All <br>
declarations are typically put at the beginning or the end
of the script. However, if you&rsquo;re using
lexically-scoped private variables created with
&quot;my()&quot;, &quot;state()&quot;, or &quot;our()&quot;,
<br>
you&rsquo;ll have to make sure your format or subroutine
definition is within the same block scope as the my if you
expect to be able to access those private variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Declaring a subroutine allows a
subroutine name to be used as if it were a list operator
from that point forward in the program. You can declare a
subroutine without defining it <br>
by saying &quot;sub name&quot;, thus:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sub myname; <br>
$me = myname $0 or die &quot;can&rsquo;t get
myname&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A bare declaration like that
declares the function to be a list operator, not a unary
operator, so you have to be careful to use parentheses (or
&quot;or&quot; instead of &quot;||&quot;.) The
&quot;||&quot; <br>
operator binds too tightly to use after list operators; it
becomes part of the last element. You can always use
parentheses around the list operators arguments to turn the
list <br>
operator back into something that behaves more like a
function call. Alternatively, you can use the prototype
&quot;($)&quot; to turn the subroutine into a unary
operator:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sub myname ($); <br>
$me = myname $0 || die &quot;can&rsquo;t get
myname&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">That now parses as you&rsquo;d
expect, but you still ought to get in the habit of using
parentheses in that situation. For more on prototypes, see
perlsub</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Subroutines declarations can
also be loaded up with the &quot;require&quot; statement or
both loaded and imported into your namespace with a
&quot;use&quot; statement. See perlmod for details on <br>
this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A statement sequence may contain
declarations of lexically-scoped variables, but apart from
declaring a variable name, the declaration acts like an
ordinary statement, and is <br>
elaborated within the sequence of statements as if it were
an ordinary statement. That means it actually has both
compile-time and run-time effects.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Comments <br>
Text from a &quot;#&quot; character until the end of the
line is a comment, and is ignored. Exceptions include
&quot;#&quot; inside a string or regular expression.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Simple Statements <br>
The only kind of simple statement is an expression evaluated
for its side-effects. Every simple statement must be
terminated with a semicolon, unless it is the final
statement <br>
in a block, in which case the semicolon is optional. But put
the semicolon in anyway if the block takes up more than one
line, because you may eventually add another line. Note <br>
that there are operators like &quot;eval {}&quot;, &quot;sub
{}&quot;, and &quot;do {}&quot; that look like compound
statements, but aren&rsquo;t--they&rsquo;re just TERMs in an
expression--and thus need an explicit <br>
termination when used as the last item in a statement.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Truth and Falsehood <br>
The number 0, the strings &rsquo;0&rsquo; and &quot;&quot;,
the empty list &quot;()&quot;, and &quot;undef&quot; are all
false in a boolean context. All other values are true.
Negation of a true value by &quot;!&quot; or &quot;not&quot;
<br>
returns a special false value. When evaluated as a string it
is treated as &quot;&quot;, but as a number, it is treated
as 0. Most Perl operators that return true or false behave
this <br>
way.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Statement Modifiers <br>
Any simple statement may optionally be followed by a SINGLE
modifier, just before the terminating semicolon (or block
ending). The possible modifiers are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if EXPR <br>
unless EXPR <br>
while EXPR <br>
until EXPR <br>
for LIST <br>
foreach LIST <br>
when EXPR</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;EXPR&quot; following
the modifier is referred to as the &quot;condition&quot;.
Its truth or falsehood determines how the modifier will
behave.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;if&quot; executes the
statement once if and only if the condition is true.
&quot;unless&quot; is the opposite, it executes the
statement unless the condition is true (that is, if the <br>
condition is false).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print &quot;Basset hounds got
long ears&quot; if length $ear &gt;= 10; <br>
go_outside() and play() unless $is_raining;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;for(each)&quot;
modifier is an iterator: it executes the statement once for
each item in the LIST (with $_ aliased to each item in
turn).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print &quot;Hello $_!0 for
qw(world Dolly nurse);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;while&quot; repeats the
statement while the condition is true. &quot;until&quot;
does the opposite, it repeats the statement until the
condition is true (or while the condition is false):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Both of these count from 0 to
10. <br>
print $i++ while $i &lt;= 10; <br>
print $j++ until $j &gt; 10;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;while&quot; and
&quot;until&quot; modifiers have the usual
&quot;&quot;while&quot; loop&quot; semantics (conditional
evaluated first), except when applied to a
&quot;do&quot;-BLOCK (or to the Perl4
&quot;do&quot;-SUBROUTINE <br>
statement), in which case the block executes once before the
conditional is evaluated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is so that you can write
loops like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">do { <br>
$line = &lt;STDIN&gt;; <br>
... <br>
} until !defined($line) || $line eq &quot;.0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See &quot;do&quot; in perlfunc.
Note also that the loop control statements described later
will NOT work in this construct, because modifiers
don&rsquo;t take loop labels. Sorry. You can <br>
always put another block inside of it (for &quot;next&quot;)
or around it (for &quot;last&quot;) to do that sort of
thing. For &quot;next&quot;, just double the braces:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">do {{ <br>
next if $x == $y; <br>
# do something here <br>
}} until $x++ &gt; $z;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For &quot;last&quot;, you have
to be more elaborate:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LOOP: { <br>
do { <br>
last if $x = $y**2; <br>
# do something here <br>
} while $x++ &lt;= $z; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: The behaviour of a
&quot;my&quot;, &quot;state&quot;, or &quot;our&quot;
modified with a statement modifier conditional or loop
construct (for example, &quot;my $x if ...&quot;) is
undefined. The value of the <br>
&quot;my&quot; variable may be &quot;undef&quot;, any
previously assigned value, or possibly anything else.
Don&rsquo;t rely on it. Future versions of perl might do
something different from the version <br>
of perl you try it out on. Here be dragons.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;when&quot; modifier is
an experimental feature that first appeared in Perl 5.14. To
use it, you should include a &quot;use v5.14&quot;
declaration. (Technically, it requires only the <br>
&quot;switch&quot; feature, but that aspect of it was not
available before 5.14.) Operative only from within a
&quot;foreach&quot; loop or a &quot;given&quot; block, it
executes the statement only if the <br>
smartmatch &quot;$_ ~~ EXPR&quot; is true. If the statement
executes, it is followed by a &quot;next&quot; from inside a
&quot;foreach&quot; and &quot;break&quot; from inside a
&quot;given&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Under the current
implementation, the &quot;foreach&quot; loop can be anywhere
within the &quot;when&quot; modifier&rsquo;s dynamic scope,
but must be within the &quot;given&quot; block&rsquo;s
lexical scope. This <br>
restricted may be relaxed in a future release. See
&quot;Switch Statements&quot; below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Compound Statements <br>
In Perl, a sequence of statements that defines a scope is
called a block. Sometimes a block is delimited by the file
containing it (in the case of a required file, or the <br>
program as a whole), and sometimes a block is delimited by
the extent of a string (in the case of an eval).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">But generally, a block is
delimited by curly brackets, also known as braces. We will
call this syntactic construct a BLOCK.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following compound
statements may be used to control flow:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if (EXPR) BLOCK <br>
if (EXPR) BLOCK else BLOCK <br>
if (EXPR) BLOCK elsif (EXPR) BLOCK ... <br>
if (EXPR) BLOCK elsif (EXPR) BLOCK ... else BLOCK</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unless (EXPR) BLOCK <br>
unless (EXPR) BLOCK else BLOCK <br>
unless (EXPR) BLOCK elsif (EXPR) BLOCK ... <br>
unless (EXPR) BLOCK elsif (EXPR) BLOCK ... else BLOCK</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">given (EXPR) BLOCK</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LABEL while (EXPR) BLOCK <br>
LABEL while (EXPR) BLOCK continue BLOCK</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LABEL until (EXPR) BLOCK <br>
LABEL until (EXPR) BLOCK continue BLOCK</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LABEL for (EXPR; EXPR; EXPR)
BLOCK <br>
LABEL for VAR (LIST) BLOCK <br>
LABEL for VAR (LIST) BLOCK continue BLOCK</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LABEL foreach (EXPR; EXPR; EXPR)
BLOCK <br>
LABEL foreach VAR (LIST) BLOCK <br>
LABEL foreach VAR (LIST) BLOCK continue BLOCK</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LABEL BLOCK <br>
LABEL BLOCK continue BLOCK</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PHASE BLOCK</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The experimental
&quot;given&quot; statement is not automatically enabled;
see &quot;Switch Statements&quot; below for how to do so,
and the attendant caveats.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unlike in C and Pascal, in Perl
these are all defined in terms of BLOCKs, not statements.
This means that the curly brackets are required--no dangling
statements allowed. If <br>
you want to write conditionals without curly brackets, there
are several other ways to do it. The following all do the
same thing:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if (!open(FOO)) { die
&quot;Can&rsquo;t open $FOO: $!&quot; } <br>
die &quot;Can&rsquo;t open $FOO: $!&quot; unless open(FOO);
<br>
open(FOO) || die &quot;Can&rsquo;t open $FOO: $!&quot;; <br>
open(FOO) ? () : die &quot;Can&rsquo;t open $FOO: $!&quot;;
<br>
# a bit exotic, that last one</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;if&quot; statement is
straightforward. Because BLOCKs are always bounded by curly
brackets, there is never any ambiguity about which
&quot;if&quot; an &quot;else&quot; goes with. If you use
<br>
&quot;unless&quot; in place of &quot;if&quot;, the sense of
the test is reversed. Like &quot;if&quot;,
&quot;unless&quot; can be followed by &quot;else&quot;.
&quot;unless&quot; can even be followed by one or more
&quot;elsif&quot; statements, <br>
though you may want to think twice before using that
particular language construct, as everyone reading your code
will have to think at least twice before they can understand
<br>
what&rsquo;s going on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;while&quot; statement
executes the block as long as the expression is true. The
&quot;until&quot; statement executes the block as long as
the expression is false. The LABEL is optional, <br>
and if present, consists of an identifier followed by a
colon. The LABEL identifies the loop for the loop control
statements &quot;next&quot;, &quot;last&quot;, and
&quot;redo&quot;. If the LABEL is <br>
omitted, the loop control statement refers to the innermost
enclosing loop. This may include dynamically looking back
your call-stack at run time to find the LABEL. Such <br>
desperate behavior triggers a warning if you use the
&quot;use warnings&quot; pragma or the -w flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If there is a
&quot;continue&quot; BLOCK, it is always executed just
before the conditional is about to be evaluated again. Thus
it can be used to increment a loop variable, even when the
<br>
loop has been continued via the &quot;next&quot;
statement.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a block is preceding by a
compilation phase keyword such as &quot;BEGIN&quot;,
&quot;END&quot;, &quot;INIT&quot;, &quot;CHECK&quot;, or
&quot;UNITCHECK&quot;, then the block will run only during
the corresponding phase of <br>
execution. See perlmod for more details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Extension modules can also hook
into the Perl parser to define new kinds of compound
statements. These are introduced by a keyword which the
extension recognizes, and the syntax <br>
following the keyword is defined entirely by the extension.
If you are an implementor, see &quot;PL_keyword_plugin&quot;
in perlapi for the mechanism. If you are using such a
module, see <br>
the module&rsquo;s documentation for details of the syntax
that it defines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Loop Control <br>
The &quot;next&quot; command starts the next iteration of
the loop:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LINE: while (&lt;STDIN&gt;) {
<br>
next LINE if /^#/; # discard comments <br>
... <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;last&quot; command
immediately exits the loop in question. The
&quot;continue&quot; block, if any, is not executed:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LINE: while (&lt;STDIN&gt;) {
<br>
last LINE if /^$/; # exit when done with header <br>
... <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;redo&quot; command
restarts the loop block without evaluating the conditional
again. The &quot;continue&quot; block, if any, is not
executed. This command is normally used by programs <br>
that want to lie to themselves about what was just
input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, when processing a
file like /etc/termcap. If your input lines might end in
backslashes to indicate continuation, you want to skip ahead
and get the next record.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">while (&lt;&gt;) { <br>
chomp; <br>
if (s/\$//) { <br>
$_ .= &lt;&gt;; <br>
redo unless eof(); <br>
} <br>
# now process $_ <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">which is Perl shorthand for the
more explicitly written version:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LINE: while (defined($line =
&lt;ARGV&gt;)) { <br>
chomp($line); <br>
if ($line =~ s/\$//) { <br>
$line .= &lt;ARGV&gt;; <br>
redo LINE unless eof(); # not eof(ARGV)! <br>
} <br>
# now process $line <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that if there were a
&quot;continue&quot; block on the above code, it would get
executed only on lines discarded by the regex (since redo
skips the continue block). A continue block <br>
is often used to reset line counters or &quot;m?pat?&quot;
one-time matches:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># inspired by
:1,$g/fred/s//WILMA/ <br>
while (&lt;&gt;) { <br>
m?(fred)? &amp;&amp; s//WILMA $1 WILMA/; <br>
m?(barney)? &amp;&amp; s//BETTY $1 BETTY/; <br>
m?(homer)? &amp;&amp; s//MARGE $1 MARGE/; <br>
} continue { <br>
print &quot;$ARGV $.: $_&quot;; <br>
close ARGV if eof; # reset $. <br>
reset if eof; # reset ?pat? <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the word &quot;while&quot; is
replaced by the word &quot;until&quot;, the sense of the
test is reversed, but the conditional is still tested before
the first iteration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Loop control statements
don&rsquo;t work in an &quot;if&quot; or &quot;unless&quot;,
since they aren&rsquo;t loops. You can double the braces to
make them such, though.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if (/pattern/) {{ <br>
last if /fred/; <br>
next if /barney/; # same effect as &quot;last&quot;, <br>
# but doesn&rsquo;t document as well <br>
# do something here <br>
}}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is caused by the fact that
a block by itself acts as a loop that executes once, see
&quot;Basic BLOCKs&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The form &quot;while/if BLOCK
BLOCK&quot;, available in Perl 4, is no longer available.
Replace any occurrence of &quot;if BLOCK&quot; by &quot;if
(do BLOCK)&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For Loops <br>
Perl&rsquo;s C-style &quot;for&quot; loop works like the
corresponding &quot;while&quot; loop; that means that
this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">for ($i = 1; $i &lt; 10; $i++) {
<br>
... <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">is the same as this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$i = 1; <br>
while ($i &lt; 10) { <br>
... <br>
} continue { <br>
$i++; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is one minor difference:
if variables are declared with &quot;my&quot; in the
initialization section of the &quot;for&quot;, the lexical
scope of those variables is exactly the &quot;for&quot; loop
(the <br>
body of the loop and the control sections).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Besides the normal array index
looping, &quot;for&quot; can lend itself to many other
interesting applications. Here&rsquo;s one that avoids the
problem you get into if you explicitly test for <br>
end-of-file on an interactive file descriptor causing your
program to appear to hang.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$on_a_tty = -t STDIN &amp;&amp;
-t STDOUT; <br>
sub prompt { print &quot;yes? &quot; if $on_a_tty } <br>
for ( prompt(); &lt;STDIN&gt;; prompt() ) { <br>
# do something <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using &quot;readline&quot; (or
the operator form, &quot;&lt;EXPR&gt;&quot;) as the
conditional of a &quot;for&quot; loop is shorthand for the
following. This behaviour is the same as a &quot;while&quot;
loop conditional.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">for ( prompt(); defined( $_ =
&lt;STDIN&gt; ); prompt() ) { <br>
# do something <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Foreach Loops <br>
The &quot;foreach&quot; loop iterates over a normal list
value and sets the variable VAR to be each element of the
list in turn. If the variable is preceded with the keyword
&quot;my&quot;, then it <br>
is lexically scoped, and is therefore visible only within
the loop. Otherwise, the variable is implicitly local to the
loop and regains its former value upon exiting the loop.
<br>
If the variable was previously declared with &quot;my&quot;,
it uses that variable instead of the global one, but
it&rsquo;s still localized to the loop. This implicit
localization occurs only <br>
in a &quot;foreach&quot; loop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;foreach&quot; keyword
is actually a synonym for the &quot;for&quot; keyword, so
you can use either. If VAR is omitted, $_ is set to each
value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If any element of LIST is an
lvalue, you can modify it by modifying VAR inside the loop.
Conversely, if any element of LIST is NOT an lvalue, any
attempt to modify that element <br>
will fail. In other words, the &quot;foreach&quot; loop
index variable is an implicit alias for each item in the
list that you&rsquo;re looping over.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If any part of LIST is an array,
&quot;foreach&quot; will get very confused if you add or
remove elements within the loop body, for example with
&quot;splice&quot;. So don&rsquo;t do that.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;foreach&quot; probably
won&rsquo;t do what you expect if VAR is a tied or other
special variable. Don&rsquo;t do that either.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">for (@ary) { s/foo/bar/ }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">for my $elem (@elements) { <br>
$elem *= 2; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">for $count (reverse(1..10),
&quot;BOOM&quot;) { <br>
print $count, &quot;0; <br>
sleep(1); <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">for (1..15) { print &quot;Merry
Christmas0; }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">foreach $item (split(/:[\0]*/,
$ENV{TERMCAP})) { <br>
print &quot;Item: $item0; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here&rsquo;s how a C programmer
might code up a particular algorithm in Perl:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">for (my $i = 0; $i &lt; @ary1;
$i++) { <br>
for (my $j = 0; $j &lt; @ary2; $j++) { <br>
if ($ary1[$i] &gt; $ary2[$j]) { <br>
last; # can&rsquo;t go to outer :-( <br>
} <br>
$ary1[$i] += $ary2[$j]; <br>
} <br>
# this is where that last takes me <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Whereas here&rsquo;s how a Perl
programmer more comfortable with the idiom might do it:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTER: for my $wid (@ary1) {
<br>
INNER: for my $jet (@ary2) { <br>
next OUTER if $wid &gt; $jet; <br>
$wid += $jet; <br>
} <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See how much easier this is?
It&rsquo;s cleaner, safer, and faster. It&rsquo;s cleaner
because it&rsquo;s less noisy. It&rsquo;s safer because if
code gets added between the inner and outer loops <br>
later on, the new code won&rsquo;t be accidentally executed.
The &quot;next&quot; explicitly iterates the other loop
rather than merely terminating the inner one. And it&rsquo;s
faster because Perl <br>
executes a &quot;foreach&quot; statement more rapidly than
it would the equivalent &quot;for&quot; loop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Basic BLOCKs <br>
A BLOCK by itself (labeled or not) is semantically
equivalent to a loop that executes once. Thus you can use
any of the loop control statements in it to leave or restart
the <br>
block. (Note that this is NOT true in &quot;eval{}&quot;,
&quot;sub{}&quot;, or contrary to popular belief
&quot;do{}&quot; blocks, which do NOT count as loops.) The
&quot;continue&quot; block is optional.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The BLOCK construct can be used
to emulate case structures.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SWITCH: { <br>
if (/^abc/) { $abc = 1; last SWITCH; } <br>
if (/^def/) { $def = 1; last SWITCH; } <br>
if (/^xyz/) { $xyz = 1; last SWITCH; } <br>
$nothing = 1; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You&rsquo;ll also find that
&quot;foreach&quot; loop used to create a topicalizer and a
switch:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SWITCH: <br>
for ($var) { <br>
if (/^abc/) { $abc = 1; last SWITCH; } <br>
if (/^def/) { $def = 1; last SWITCH; } <br>
if (/^xyz/) { $xyz = 1; last SWITCH; } <br>
$nothing = 1; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Such constructs are quite
frequently used, both because older versions of Perl had no
official &quot;switch&quot; statement, and also because the
new version described immediately below <br>
remains experimental and can sometimes be confusing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Switch Statements <br>
Starting from Perl 5.10.1 (well, 5.10.0, but it didn&rsquo;t
work right), you can say</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use feature
&quot;switch&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">to enable an experimental switch
feature. This is loosely based on an old version of a Perl 6
proposal, but it no longer resembles the Perl 6 construct.
You also get the <br>
switch feature whenever you declare that your code prefers
to run under a version of Perl that is 5.10 or later. For
example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use v5.14;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Under the &quot;switch&quot;
feature, Perl gains the experimental keywords
&quot;given&quot;, &quot;when&quot;, &quot;default&quot;,
&quot;continue&quot;, and &quot;break&quot;. Starting from
Perl 5.16, one can prefix the switch keywords <br>
with &quot;CORE::&quot; to access the feature without a
&quot;use feature&quot; statement. The keywords
&quot;given&quot; and &quot;when&quot; are analogous to
&quot;switch&quot; and &quot;case&quot; in other languages,
so the code in <br>
the previous section could be rewritten as</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use v5.10.1; <br>
for ($var) { <br>
when (/^abc/) { $abc = 1 } <br>
when (/^def/) { $def = 1 } <br>
when (/^xyz/) { $xyz = 1 } <br>
default { $nothing = 1 } <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;foreach&quot; is the
non-experimental way to set a topicalizer. If you wish to
use the highly experimental &quot;given&quot;, that could be
written like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use v5.10.1; <br>
given ($var) { <br>
when (/^abc/) { $abc = 1 } <br>
when (/^def/) { $def = 1 } <br>
when (/^xyz/) { $xyz = 1 } <br>
default { $nothing = 1 } <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As of 5.14, that can also be
written this way:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use v5.14; <br>
for ($var) { <br>
$abc = 1 when /^abc/; <br>
$def = 1 when /^def/; <br>
$xyz = 1 when /^xyz/; <br>
default { $nothing = 1 } <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Or if you don&rsquo;t care to
play it safe, like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use v5.14; <br>
given ($var) { <br>
$abc = 1 when /^abc/; <br>
$def = 1 when /^def/; <br>
$xyz = 1 when /^xyz/; <br>
default { $nothing = 1 } <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The arguments to
&quot;given&quot; and &quot;when&quot; are in scalar
context, and &quot;given&quot; assigns the $_ variable its
topic value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Exactly what the EXPR argument
to &quot;when&quot; does is hard to describe precisely, but
in general, it tries to guess what you want done. Sometimes
it is interpreted as &quot;$_ ~~ EXPR&quot;, <br>
and sometimes it does not. It also behaves differently when
lexically enclosed by a &quot;given&quot; block than it does
when dynamically enclosed by a &quot;foreach&quot; loop. The
rules are far <br>
too difficult to understand to be described here. See
&quot;Experimental Details on given and when&quot; later
on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Due to an unfortunate bug in how
&quot;given&quot; was implemented between Perl 5.10 and
5.14, under those implementations the version of $_ governed
by &quot;given&quot; is merely a lexically <br>
scoped copy of the original, not a dynamically scoped alias
to the original, as it would be if it were a
&quot;foreach&quot; or under both the original and the
current Perl 6 language <br>
specification. This bug is expected to be addressed in a
future release of Perl. For forwards compatibility, if you
really want a lexical $_, specify that explicitly:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">given(my $_ = EXPR) { ... }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the meanwhile, stick to
&quot;foreach&quot; for your topicalizer and you will be
less unhappy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Goto <br>
Although not for the faint of heart, Perl does support a
&quot;goto&quot; statement. There are three forms:
&quot;goto&quot;-LABEL, &quot;goto&quot;-EXPR, and
&quot;goto&quot;-&amp;NAME. A loop&rsquo;s LABEL is not
actually a <br>
valid target for a &quot;goto&quot;; it&rsquo;s just the
name of the loop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;goto&quot;-LABEL form
finds the statement labeled with LABEL and resumes execution
there. It may not be used to go into any construct that
requires initialization, such as a <br>
subroutine or a &quot;foreach&quot; loop. It also
can&rsquo;t be used to go into a construct that is optimized
away. It can be used to go almost anywhere else within the
dynamic scope, <br>
including out of subroutines, but it&rsquo;s usually better
to use some other construct such as &quot;last&quot; or
&quot;die&quot;. The author of Perl has never felt the need
to use this form of &quot;goto&quot; <br>
(in Perl, that is--C is another matter).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;goto&quot;-EXPR form
expects a label name, whose scope will be resolved
dynamically. This allows for computed &quot;goto&quot;s per
FORTRAN, but isn&rsquo;t necessarily recommended if
you&rsquo;re <br>
optimizing for maintainability:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">goto((&quot;FOO&quot;,
&quot;BAR&quot;, &quot;GLARCH&quot;)[$i]);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;goto&quot;-&amp;NAME
form is highly magical, and substitutes a call to the named
subroutine for the currently running subroutine. This is
used by &quot;AUTOLOAD()&quot; subroutines that wish <br>
to load another subroutine and then pretend that the other
subroutine had been called in the first place (except that
any modifications to @_ in the current subroutine are <br>
propagated to the other subroutine.) After the
&quot;goto&quot;, not even &quot;caller()&quot; will be able
to tell that this routine was called first.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In almost all cases like this,
it&rsquo;s usually a far, far better idea to use the
structured control flow mechanisms of &quot;next&quot;,
&quot;last&quot;, or &quot;redo&quot; instead of resorting
to a &quot;goto&quot;. <br>
For certain applications, the catch and throw pair of
&quot;eval{}&quot; and die() for exception processing can
also be a prudent approach.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Ellipsis Statement <br>
Beginning in Perl 5.12, Perl accepts an ellipsis,
&quot;&quot;...&quot;&quot;, as a placeholder for code that
you haven&rsquo;t implemented yet. This form of ellipsis,
the unimplemented statement, should <br>
not be confused with the binary flip-flop &quot;...&quot;
operator. One is a statement and the other an operator.
(Perl doesn&rsquo;t usually confuse them because usually
Perl can tell whether <br>
it wants an operator or a statement, but see below for
exceptions.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When Perl 5.12 or later
encounters an ellipsis statement, it parses this without
error, but if and when you should actually try to execute
it, Perl throws an exception with the <br>
text &quot;Unimplemented&quot;:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use v5.12; <br>
sub unimplemented { ... } <br>
eval { unimplemented() }; <br>
if ($@ =~ /^Unimplemented at /) { <br>
say &quot;I found an ellipsis!&quot;; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can only use the elliptical
statement to stand in for a complete statement. These
examples of how the ellipsis works:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use v5.12; <br>
{ ... } <br>
sub foo { ... } <br>
...; <br>
eval { ... }; <br>
sub somemeth { <br>
my $self = shift; <br>
...; <br>
} <br>
$x = do { <br>
my $n; <br>
...; <br>
say &quot;Hurrah!&quot;; <br>
$n; <br>
};</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The elliptical statement cannot
stand in for an expression that is part of a larger
statement, since the &quot;...&quot; is also the three-dot
version of the flip-flop operator (see &quot;Range <br>
Operators&quot; in perlop).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These examples of attempts to
use an ellipsis are syntax errors:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use v5.12;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print ...; <br>
open(my $fh, &quot;&gt;&quot;, &quot;/dev/passwd&quot;) or
...; <br>
if ($condition &amp;&amp; ... ) { say &quot;Howdy&quot;
};</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are some cases where Perl
can&rsquo;t immediately tell the difference between an
expression and a statement. For instance, the syntax for a
block and an anonymous hash reference <br>
constructor look the same unless there&rsquo;s something in
the braces to give Perl a hint. The ellipsis is a syntax
error if Perl doesn&rsquo;t guess that the &quot;{ ...
}&quot; is a block. In <br>
that case, it doesn&rsquo;t think the &quot;...&quot; is an
ellipsis because it&rsquo;s expecting an expression instead
of a statement:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@transformed = map { ... }
@input; # syntax error</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can use a &quot;;&quot;
inside your block to denote that the &quot;{ ... }&quot; is
a block and not a hash reference constructor. Now the
ellipsis works:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@transformed = map {; ... }
@input; # ; disambiguates</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@transformed = map { ...; }
@input; # ; disambiguates</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: Some folks colloquially
refer to this bit of punctuation as a &quot;yada-yada&quot;
or &quot;triple-dot&quot;, but its true name is actually an
ellipsis. Perl does not yet accept the Unicode <br>
version, U+2026 HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS, as an alias for
&quot;...&quot;, but someday it may.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PODs: Embedded Documentation
<br>
Perl has a mechanism for intermixing documentation with
source code. While it&rsquo;s expecting the beginning of a
new statement, if the compiler encounters a line that begins
with an <br>
equal sign and a word, like this</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">=head1 Here There Be Pods!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Then that text and all remaining
text up through and including a line beginning with
&quot;=cut&quot; will be ignored. The format of the
intervening text is described in perlpod.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This allows you to intermix your
source code and your documentation text freely, as in</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">=item snazzle($)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The snazzle() function will
behave in the most spectacular <br>
form that you can possibly imagine, not even excepting <br>
cybernetic pyrotechnics.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">=cut back to the compiler, nuff
of this pod stuff!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sub snazzle($) { <br>
my $thingie = shift; <br>
......... <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that pod translators should
look at only paragraphs beginning with a pod directive (it
makes parsing easier), whereas the compiler actually knows
to look for pod escapes <br>
even in the middle of a paragraph. This means that the
following secret stuff will be ignored by both the compiler
and the translators.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$a=3; <br>
=secret stuff <br>
warn &quot;Neither POD nor CODE!?&quot; <br>
=cut back <br>
print &quot;got $a0;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You probably shouldn&rsquo;t
rely upon the &quot;warn()&quot; being podded out forever.
Not all pod translators are well-behaved in this regard, and
perhaps the compiler will become pickier.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One may also use pod directives
to quickly comment out a section of code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Plain Old Comments (Not!) <br>
Perl can process line directives, much like the C
preprocessor. Using this, one can control Perl&rsquo;s idea
of filenames and line numbers in error or warning messages
(especially <br>
for strings that are processed with &quot;eval()&quot;). The
syntax for this mechanism is almost the same as for most C
preprocessors: it matches the regular expression</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># example: &rsquo;# line 42
&quot;new_filename.plx&quot;&rsquo; <br>
/^ line (+) <br>
(?:?)([^&quot;]+))? <br>
$/x</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">with $1 being the line number
for the next line, and $3 being the optional filename
(specified with or without quotes). Note that no whitespace
may precede the &quot;#&quot;, unlike <br>
modern C preprocessors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is a fairly obvious gotcha
included with the line directive: Debuggers and profilers
will only show the last source line to appear at a
particular line number in a given <br>
file. Care should be taken not to cause line number
collisions in code you&rsquo;d like to debug later.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here are some examples that you
should be able to type into your command shell:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% perl <br>
# line 200 &quot;bzzzt&quot; <br>
# the &rsquo;#&rsquo; on the previous line must be the first
char on line <br>
die &rsquo;foo&rsquo;; <br>
__END__ <br>
foo at bzzzt line 201.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% perl <br>
# line 200 &quot;bzzzt&quot; <br>
eval qq[0line 2001 &quot;&quot;0ie &rsquo;foo&rsquo;]; print
$@; <br>
__END__ <br>
foo at - line 2001.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% perl <br>
eval qq[0line 200 &quot;foo bar&quot;0ie &rsquo;foo&rsquo;];
print $@; <br>
__END__ <br>
foo at foo bar line 200.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% perl <br>
# line 345 &quot;goop&quot; <br>
eval &quot;0line &quot; . __LINE__ . &rsquo; &quot;&rsquo; .
__FILE__ .&quot; <br>
print $@; <br>
__END__ <br>
foo at goop line 345.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Experimental Details on given
and when <br>
As previously mentioned, the &quot;switch&quot; feature is
considered highly experimental; it is subject to change with
little notice. In particular, both &quot;given&quot; and
&quot;when&quot; have tricky <br>
behaviours that are expected to change to become less tricky
in the future. Do not rely upon their current
(mis)implementations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here is a longer example of
&quot;given&quot;:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use feature &quot;:5.10&quot;;
<br>
given ($foo) { <br>
when (undef) { <br>
say &rsquo;$foo is undefined&rsquo;; <br>
} <br>
when (&quot;foo&quot;) { <br>
say &rsquo;$foo is the string &quot;foo&quot;&rsquo;; <br>
} <br>
when ([1,3,5,7,9]) { <br>
say &rsquo;$foo is an odd digit&rsquo;; <br>
continue; # Fall through <br>
} <br>
when ($_ &lt; 100) { <br>
say &rsquo;$foo is numerically less than 100&rsquo;; <br>
} <br>
when (complicated_check) { <br>
say &rsquo;a complicated check for $foo is true&rsquo;; <br>
} <br>
default { <br>
die q(I don&rsquo;t know what to do with $foo); <br>
} <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As currently implemented,
&quot;given(EXPR)&quot; assign the value of EXPR to merely a
lexically scoped copy (!) of $_, not a dynamically scoped
alias the way &quot;foreach&quot; does. That makes <br>
it similar to</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">do { my $_ = EXPR; ... }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">except that the block is
automatically broken out of by a successful &quot;when&quot;
or an explicit &quot;break&quot;. Because it is only a copy,
and because it is only lexically scoped, not <br>
dynamically scoped, you cannot do the things with it that
you are used to in a &quot;foreach&quot; loop. In
particular, you probably cannot use arbitrary function
calls. Best stick to <br>
&quot;foreach&quot; for that.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most of the power comes from the
implicit smartmatching that can sometimes apply. Most of the
time, &quot;when(EXPR)&quot; is treated as an implicit
smartmatch of $_, that is, &quot;$_ ~~ <br>
EXPR&quot;. (See &quot;Smartmatch Operator&quot; in perlop
for more information on smartmatching.) But when EXPR is one
of the 10 exceptional cases (or things like them) listed
below, it is <br>
used directly as a boolean.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. A user-defined subroutine
call or a method invocation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. A regular expression match in
the form of &quot;/REGEX/&quot;, &quot;$foo =~
/REGEX/&quot;, or &quot;$foo =~ EXPR&quot;. Also, a negated
regular expression match in the form &quot;!/REGEX/&quot;,
&quot;$foo !~ <br>
/REGEX/&quot;, or &quot;$foo !~ EXPR&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. A smart match that uses an
explicit &quot;~~&quot; operator, such as &quot;EXPR ~~
EXPR&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. A boolean comparison operator
such as &quot;$_ &lt; 10&quot; or &quot;$x eq
&quot;abc&quot;&quot; The relational operators that this
applies to are the six numeric comparisons
(&quot;&lt;&quot;, &quot;&gt;&quot;, &quot;&lt;=&quot;,
&quot;&gt;=&quot;, &quot;==&quot;, <br>
and &quot;!=&quot;), and the six string comparisons
(&quot;lt&quot;, &quot;gt&quot;, &quot;le&quot;,
&quot;ge&quot;, &quot;eq&quot;, and &quot;ne&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: You will often have to use
&quot;$c ~~ $_&quot; because the default case uses &quot;$_
~~ $c&quot; , which is frequently the opposite of what you
want.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5. At least the three builtin
functions &quot;defined(...)&quot;, &quot;exists(...)&quot;,
and &quot;eof(...)&quot;. We might someday add more of these
later if we think of them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6. A negated expression, whether
&quot;!(EXPR)&quot; or &quot;not(EXPR)&quot;, or a logical
exclusive-or, &quot;(EXPR1) xor (EXPR2)&quot;. The bitwise
versions (&quot;~&quot; and &quot;^&quot;) are not
included.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">7. A filetest operator, with
exactly 4 exceptions: &quot;-s&quot;, &quot;-M&quot;,
&quot;-A&quot;, and &quot;-C&quot;, as these return
numerical values, not boolean ones. The &quot;-z&quot;
filetest operator is not included in <br>
the exception list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">8. The &quot;..&quot; and
&quot;...&quot; flip-flop operators. Note that the
&quot;...&quot; flip-flop operator is completely different
from the &quot;...&quot; elliptical statement just
described.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In those 8 cases above, the
value of EXPR is used directly as a boolean, so no
smartmatching is done. You may think of &quot;when&quot; as
a smartsmartmatch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Furthermore, Perl inspects the
operands of logical operators to decide whether to use
smartmatching for each one by applying the above test to the
operands:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">9. If EXPR is &quot;EXPR1
&amp;&amp; EXPR2&quot; or &quot;EXPR1 and EXPR2&quot;, the
test is applied recursively to both EXPR1 and EXPR2. Only if
both operands also pass the test, recursively, will the <br>
expression be treated as boolean. Otherwise, smartmatching
is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">10. If EXPR is &quot;EXPR1 ||
EXPR2&quot;, &quot;EXPR1 // EXPR2&quot;, or &quot;EXPR1 or
EXPR2&quot;, the test is applied recursively to EXPR1 only
(which might itself be a higher-precedence AND operator, for
<br>
example, and thus subject to the previous rule), not to
EXPR2. If EXPR1 is to use smartmatching, then EXPR2 also
does so, no matter what EXPR2 contains. But if EXPR2 does
<br>
not get to use smartmatching, then the second argument will
not be either. This is quite different from the
&quot;&amp;&amp;&quot; case just described, so be
careful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These rules are complicated, but
the goal is for them to do what you want (even if you
don&rsquo;t quite understand why they are doing it). For
example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">when (/^+$/ &amp;&amp; $_ &lt;
75) { ... }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will be treated as a boolean
match because the rules say both a regex match and an
explicit test on $_ will be treated as boolean.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">when ([qw(foo bar)] &amp;&amp;
/baz/) { ... }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will use smartmatching because
only one of the operands is a boolean: the other uses
smartmatching, and that wins.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Further:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">when ([qw(foo bar)] || /^baz/) {
... }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will use smart matching (only
the first operand is considered), whereas</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">when (/^baz/ || [qw(foo bar)]) {
... }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will test only the regex, which
causes both operands to be treated as boolean. Watch out for
this one, then, because an arrayref is always a true value,
which makes it <br>
effectively redundant. Not a good idea.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tautologous boolean operators
are still going to be optimized away. Don&rsquo;t be tempted
to write</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">when (&quot;foo&quot; or
&quot;bar&quot;) { ... }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This will optimize down to
&quot;foo&quot;, so &quot;bar&quot; will never be considered
(even though the rules say to use a smartmatch on
&quot;foo&quot;). For an alternation like this, an array ref
will <br>
work, because this will instigate smartmatching:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">when ([qw(foo bar)] { ... }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is somewhat equivalent to
the C-style switch statement&rsquo;s fallthrough
functionality (not to be confused with Perl&rsquo;s
fallthrough functionality--see below), wherein the same <br>
block is used for several &quot;case&quot; statements.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another useful shortcut is that,
if you use a literal array or hash as the argument to
&quot;given&quot;, it is turned into a reference. So
&quot;given(@foo)&quot; is the same as
&quot;given(@foo)&quot;, <br>
for example.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;default&quot; behaves
exactly like &quot;when(1 == 1)&quot;, which is to say that
it always matches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Breaking out</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can use the
&quot;break&quot; keyword to break out of the enclosing
&quot;given&quot; block. Every &quot;when&quot; block is
implicitly ended with a &quot;break&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fall-through</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can use the
&quot;continue&quot; keyword to fall through from one case
to the next:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">given($foo) { <br>
when (/x/) { say &rsquo;$foo contains an x&rsquo;; continue
} <br>
when (/y/) { say &rsquo;$foo contains a y&rsquo; } <br>
default { say &rsquo;$foo does not contain a y&rsquo; } <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Return value</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a &quot;given&quot;
statement is also a valid expression (for example, when
it&rsquo;s the last statement of a block), it evaluates
to:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; An empty list as
soon as an explicit &quot;break&quot; is encountered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The value of the
last evaluated expression of the successful
&quot;when&quot;/&quot;default&quot; clause, if there
happens to be one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The value of the
last evaluated expression of the &quot;given&quot; block if
no condition is true.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In both last cases, the last
expression is evaluated in the context that was applied to
the &quot;given&quot; block.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that, unlike &quot;if&quot;
and &quot;unless&quot;, failed &quot;when&quot; statements
always evaluate to an empty list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">my $price = do { <br>
given ($item) { <br>
when ([&quot;pear&quot;, &quot;apple&quot;]) { 1 } <br>
break when &quot;vote&quot;; # My vote cannot be bought <br>
1e10 when /Mona Lisa/; <br>
&quot;unknown&quot;; <br>
} <br>
};</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Currently, &quot;given&quot;
blocks can&rsquo;t always be used as proper expressions.
This may be addressed in a future version of Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Switching in a loop</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Instead of using
&quot;given()&quot;, you can use a &quot;foreach()&quot;
loop. For example, here&rsquo;s one way to count how many
times a particular string occurs in an array:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use v5.10.1; <br>
my $count = 0; <br>
for (@array) { <br>
when (&quot;foo&quot;) { ++$count } <br>
} <br>
print &quot;@array contains $count copies of
&rsquo;foo&rsquo;0;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Or in a more recent version:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use v5.14; <br>
my $count = 0; <br>
for (@array) { <br>
++$count when &quot;foo&quot;; <br>
} <br>
print &quot;@array contains $count copies of
&rsquo;foo&rsquo;0;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At the end of all
&quot;when&quot; blocks, there is an implicit
&quot;next&quot;. You can override that with an explicit
&quot;last&quot; if you&rsquo;re interested in only the
first match alone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This doesn&rsquo;t work if you
explicitly specify a loop variable, as in &quot;for $item
(@array)&quot;. You have to use the default variable $_.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Differences from Perl 6</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Perl 5 smartmatch and
&quot;given&quot;/&quot;when&quot; constructs are not
compatible with their Perl 6 analogues. The most visible
difference and least important difference is that, in Perl
<br>
5, parentheses are required around the argument to
&quot;given()&quot; and &quot;when()&quot; (except when this
last one is used as a statement modifier). Parentheses in
Perl 6 are always optional <br>
in a control construct such as &quot;if()&quot;,
&quot;while()&quot;, or &quot;when()&quot;; they can&rsquo;t
be made optional in Perl 5 without a great deal of potential
confusion, because Perl 5 would parse the <br>
expression</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">given $foo { <br>
... <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">as though the argument to
&quot;given&quot; were an element of the hash %foo,
interpreting the braces as hash-element syntax.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, their are many, many
other differences. For example, this works in Perl 5:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use v5.12; <br>
my @primary = (&quot;red&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;,
&quot;green&quot;);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if (@primary ~~ &quot;red&quot;)
{ <br>
say &quot;primary smartmatches red&quot;; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if (&quot;red&quot; ~~ @primary)
{ <br>
say &quot;red smartmatches primary&quot;; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">say &quot;that&rsquo;s all,
folks!&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">But it doesn&rsquo;t work at all
in Perl 6. Instead, you should use the (parallelizable)
&quot;any&quot; operator instead:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if any(@primary) eq
&quot;red&quot; { <br>
say &quot;primary smartmatches red&quot;; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if &quot;red&quot; eq
any(@primary) { <br>
say &quot;red smartmatches primary&quot;; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The table of smartmatches in
&quot;Smartmatch Operator&quot; in perlop is not identical
to that proposed by the Perl 6 specification, mainly due to
differences between Perl 6&rsquo;s and Perl <br>
5&rsquo;s data models, but also because the Perl 6 spec has
changed since Perl 5 rushed into early adoption.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In Perl 6, &quot;when()&quot;
will always do an implicit smartmatch with its argument,
while in Perl 5 it is convenient (albeit potentially
confusing) to suppress this implicit smartmatch <br>
in various rather loosely-defined situations, as roughly
outlined above. (The difference is largely because Perl 5
does not have, even internally, a boolean type.)</p>
