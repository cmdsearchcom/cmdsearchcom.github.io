<p>PERL5142DELTA(1) Perl Programmers Reference Guide
PERL5142DELTA(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
perl5142delta - what is new for perl v5.14.2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This document describes differences between the 5.14.1
release and the 5.14.2 release.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are upgrading from an
earlier release such as 5.14.0, first read perl5141delta,
which describes differences between 5.14.0 and 5.14.1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Core Enhancements <br>
No changes since 5.14.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Security <br>
&quot;File::Glob::bsd_glob()&quot; memory error with
GLOB_ALTDIRFUNC (CVE-2011-2728). <br>
Calling &quot;File::Glob::bsd_glob&quot; with the
unsupported flag GLOB_ALTDIRFUNC would cause an access
violation / segfault. A Perl program that accepts a flags
value from an external <br>
source could expose itself to denial of service or arbitrary
code execution attacks. There are no known exploits in the
wild. The problem has been corrected by explicitly <br>
disabling all unsupported flags and setting unused function
pointers to null. Bug reported by Clement Lecigne.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;Encode&quot; decode_xs
n-byte heap-overflow (CVE-2011-2939) <br>
A bug in &quot;Encode&quot; could, on certain inputs, cause
the heap to overflow. This problem has been corrected. Bug
reported by Robert Zacek.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Incompatible Changes <br>
There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.14.0.
If any exist, they are bugs and reports are welcome.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Deprecations <br>
There have been no deprecations since 5.14.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Modules and Pragmata <br>
New Modules and Pragmata <br>
None</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Updated Modules and Pragmata
<br>
&Acirc;&middot; CPAN has been upgraded from version 1.9600
to version 1.9600_01.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CPAN::Distribution has been
upgraded from version 1.9602 to 1.9602_01.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Backported bugfixes from CPAN
version 1.9800. Ensures proper detection of
&quot;configure_requires&quot; prerequisites from CPAN Meta
files in the case where &quot;dynamic_config&quot; is true.
<br>
[rt.cpan.org #68835]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also ensures that
&quot;configure_requires&quot; is only checked in META
files, not MYMETA files, so protect against MYMETA
generation that drops &quot;configure_requires&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Encode has been
upgraded from version 2.42 to 2.42_01.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See &quot;Security&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; File::Glob has
been upgraded from version 1.12 to version 1.13.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See &quot;Security&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; PerlIO::scalar
has been upgraded from version 0.11 to 0.11_01.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It fixes a problem with
&quot;open my $fh, &quot;&gt;&quot;, calar&quot; not working
if $scalar is a copy-on-write scalar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Removed Modules and Pragmata
<br>
None</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Platform Support <br>
New Platforms <br>
None</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Discontinued Platforms <br>
None</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Platform-Specific Notes <br>
HP-UX PA-RISC/64 now supports gcc-4.x <br>
A fix to correct the socketsize now makes the test suite
pass on HP-UX PA-RISC for 64bitall builds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Building on OS X 10.7 Lion and
Xcode 4 works again <br>
The build system has been updated to work with the build
tools under Mac OS X 10.7.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bug Fixes <br>
&Acirc;&middot; In @INC filters (subroutines returned by
subroutines in @INC), $_ used to misbehave: If returned from
a subroutine, it would not be copied, but the variable
itself would be <br>
returned; and freeing $_ (e.g., with &quot;undef *_&quot;)
would cause perl to crash. This has been fixed [perl
#91880].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Perl 5.10.0
introduced some faulty logic that made &quot;U*&quot; in the
middle of a pack template equivalent to &quot;U0&quot; if
the input string was empty. This has been fixed [perl
#90160].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;caller&quot; no longer leaks memory when called from
the DB package if @DB::args was assigned to after the first
call to &quot;caller&quot;. Carp was triggering this bug
[perl #97010].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;utf8::decode&quot; had a nasty bug that would modify
copy-on-write scalars&rsquo; string buffers in place (i.e.,
skipping the copy). This could result in hashes having two
elements <br>
with the same key [perl #91834].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Localising a
tied variable used to make it read-only if it contained a
copy-on-write string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Elements of
restricted hashes (see the fields pragma) containing
copy-on-write values couldn&rsquo;t be deleted, nor could
such hashes be cleared (&quot;%hash = ()&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Locking a hash
element that is a glob copy no longer causes subsequent
assignment to it to corrupt the glob.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A panic
involving the combination of the regular e s c a p e s e q u
e n c e h a s b e expression modifiers &quot;/aa&quot;
introduced in 5.14.0 and the &quot;e n f i x e d [ p e r l #
9 5 9 6 4 ] .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Known Problems <br>
This is a list of some significant unfixed bugs, which are
regressions from 5.12.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;PERL_GLOBAL_STRUCT&quot; is broken.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since perl 5.14.0, building with
&quot;-DPERL_GLOBAL_STRUCT&quot; hasn&rsquo;t been possible.
This means that perl currently doesn&rsquo;t work on any
platforms that require it to be built this <br>
way, including Symbian.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">While
&quot;PERL_GLOBAL_STRUCT&quot; now works again on recent
development versions of perl, it actually working on Symbian
again hasn&rsquo;t been verified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">We&rsquo;d be very interested in
hearing from anyone working with Perl on Symbian.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Acknowledgements <br>
Perl 5.14.2 represents approximately three months of
development since Perl 5.14.1 and contains approximately
1200 lines of changes across 61 files from 9 authors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl continues to flourish into
its third decade thanks to a vibrant community of users and
developers. The following people are known to have
contributed the improvements that <br>
became Perl 5.14.2:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Craig A. Berry, David Golden,
Father Chrysostomos, Florian Ragwitz, H.Merijn Brand, Karl
Williamson, Nicholas Clark, Pau Amma and Ricardo Signes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Reporting Bugs <br>
If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the
articles recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc
newsgroup and the perl bug database at
http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/ . <br>
There may also be information at http://www.perl.org/ , the
Perl Home Page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you believe you have an
unreported bug, please run the perlbug program included with
your release. Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case. Your bug <br>
report, along with the output of &quot;perl -V&quot;, will
be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl
porting team.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the bug you are reporting has
security implications, which make it inappropriate to send
to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send it to
<br>
perl5-security-report@perl.org. This points to a closed
subscription unarchived mailing list, which includes all the
core committers, who be able to help assess the impact of
<br>
issues, figure out a resolution, and help co-ordinate the
release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all
platforms on which Perl is supported. Please only use this
<br>
address for security issues in the Perl core, not for
modules independently distributed on CPAN.</p>
