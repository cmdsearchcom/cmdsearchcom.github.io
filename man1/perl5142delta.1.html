perl5142delta - what is new for perl v5.14.2
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
This document describes differences between the 5.14.1 release and the 5.14.2
  release.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.14.0, first read
  perl5141delta, which describes differences between 5.14.0 and 5.14.1.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Core_Enhancements"><a class="selflink" href="#Core_Enhancements">Core
  Enhancements</a></h1>
No changes since 5.14.0.

<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="&quot;File::Glob::bsd_glob()&quot;_memory_error_with_GLOB_ALTDIRFUNC_(CVE-2011-2728)."><a class="selflink" href="#&quot;File::Glob::bsd_glob()&quot;_memory_error_with_GLOB_ALTDIRFUNC_(CVE-2011-2728).">&quot;File::Glob::bsd_glob()&quot;
  memory error with GLOB_ALTDIRFUNC (CVE-2011-2728).</a></h2>
Calling &quot;File::Glob::bsd_glob&quot; with the unsupported flag
  GLOB_ALTDIRFUNC would cause an access violation / segfault. A Perl program
  that accepts a flags value from an external source could expose itself to
  denial of service or arbitrary code execution attacks. There are no known
  exploits in the wild. The problem has been corrected by explicitly disabling
  all unsupported flags and setting unused function pointers to null. Bug
  reported by Clement Lecigne.

  decode_xs n-byte heap-overflow (CVE-2011-2939)</a></h2>
A bug in &quot;Encode&quot; could, on certain inputs, cause the heap to
  overflow. This problem has been corrected. Bug reported by Robert Zacek.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Incompatible_Changes"><a class="selflink" href="#Incompatible_Changes">Incompatible
  Changes</a></h1>
There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.14.0. If any exist, they
  are bugs and reports are welcome.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Deprecations"><a class="selflink" href="#Deprecations">Deprecations</a></h1>
There have been no deprecations since 5.14.0.

    Since perl 5.14.0, building with &quot;-DPERL_GLOBAL_STRUCT&quot; hasn't
      been possible. This means that perl currently doesn't work on any
      platforms that require it to be built this way, including Symbian.

    While &quot;PERL_GLOBAL_STRUCT&quot; now works again on recent development
      versions of perl, it actually working on Symbian again hasn't been

  Bugs</a></h1>
If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently
  posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at
  http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/ . There may also be information at
  http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug program
  included with your release. Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
  sufficient test case. Your bug report, along with the output of &quot;perl
  -V&quot;, will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl
  porting team.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it
  inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send it
  to perl5-security-report@perl.org. This points to a closed subscription
  unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core committers, who be able
  to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help
  co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all
  platforms on which Perl is supported. Please only use this address for
  security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently distributed on
  CPAN.
