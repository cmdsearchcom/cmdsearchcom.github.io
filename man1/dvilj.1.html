<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
dvilj4, dvilj4l, dvilj2p, dvilj - convert a TeX DVI file to
PCL, for HP LaserJet printers</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
dvilj [--Dnumber] [-ccopies] [-dmode] [-D] [-E]
[-eoutputfile] <br>
[-ffrompage] [-g] [-hheaderfile] [-l] [-Mflag] [-mmag]
[-ppages] <br>

[filename]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
dvilj and siblings convert TeX-output &quot;.dvi&quot; files
into PCL (the Hewlett-Packard Printer Control Language)
commands suitable for printing on a HP LaserJet+, HP
LaserJet IIP <br>
(using dvilj2p), HP LaserJet 4 (using dvilj4), and fully
compatible printers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dvilj4 also provides support for
the builtin Intellifont and TrueType fonts; TFM and VF files
are provided in the distribution. Virtual fonts are not
supported directly by <br>
dvilj, so you must run dvicopy(1) first, or otherwise expand
the virtual fonts</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All programs are generated from
one source file dvi2xx.c. They are usually called via a
shell script or as a line printer filter. One such script,
dvihp(1), is included in the <br>
distribution. It provides command-line options similar to
those of dvips(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
--Dnumber <br>
Debug according to the bits of number; see the kpathsea(3)
manual for values. Also turns on general verbosity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-cnumber <br>
Print each page number times (including original)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dnumber <br>
print in duplex mode. The option -d1 means long edge
binding, -d2 stands for short edge binding. This option is
only selectable in dvilj4 and dvilj2p.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D[-12] <br>
Double-sided printing - see below; -D1 prints odd sides
only, -D2 is for even pages, a trailing - suppresses
printing of empty padding pages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E Switch printer into econo
mode (dvilj4 only).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-eoutfile <br>
Send output to outfile instead of the basename of dvi file
extended with &quot;.lj&quot;. If outfile is - (as in
&quot;-e-&quot;) the output is directed to standard output
and can be directly <br>
piped into a spooler.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fpagenum <br>
Print pages with TeX page numbers greater than or equal to
pagenum.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g Go mode: do not reset printer
at start of job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-hheaderfile <br>
Copy headerfile to output before translation of the DVI
file. Used to send arbitrary commands to the
laserprinter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l Print output in landscape
mode; supported only by dvilj2p and dvilj4.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Mflag <br>
Do (not) call mktexpk(1) to generate fonts on demand. -M1
and -M are equivalent. -M0 enables invoking mktexpk(1).
(This is the same as in dvips(1).) The default behavior <br>
(i.e., if no -M option is given) is chosen at compile-time;
as distributed, mktexpk is enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mmagnification <br>
Specify the magnification to use. The following are
available:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m#usermag e.g., #900 <br>
-m0 equivalent to -m#1000 <br>
-mh equivalent to -m#1095 <br>
-m1 equivalent to -m#1200 <br>
-mq equivalent to -m#1250 <br>
-m2 equivalent to -m#1440 <br>
-m3 equivalent to -m#1728 <br>
-m4 equivalent to -m#2074 <br>
-m5 equivalent to -m#2488</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ppagecount <br>
Print pagecount pages after the starting page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Quiet operation: omit final
statistics, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Toggle page reversal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-spagesize <br>
Specify the page size:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s1: Executive (7.25&quot; x
10.5&quot;) <br>
-s2: Letter (8.5&quot; x 11&quot;) <br>
-s3: Legal (8.5&quot; x 14&quot;) <br>
-s6: Ledger (11&quot; x 17&quot;) <br>
-s25: A5 paper (148mm x 210mm) <br>
-s26: A4 paper (210mm x 297mm) <br>
-s27: A3 (297mm x 420mm) <br>
-s45: JIS B5 paper (182mm x 257mm) <br>
-s46: JIS B4 paper (250mm x 354mm) <br>
-s71: Hagaki postcard (100mm x 148mm) <br>
-s72: Oufuku-Hagaki postcard (200mm x 148mm) <br>
-s80: Monarch Envelope (3 7/8&quot; x 7 1/2&quot;) <br>
-s81: Commercial Envelope 10 (4 1/8&quot; x 9 1/2&quot;)
<br>
-s90: International DL (110mm x 220mm) <br>
-s91: International C5 (162mm x 229mm) <br>
-s100: International B5 (176mm x 250mm)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These values are from the PCL 5
technical reference manual. If the -s commandline option is
omitted, no clipping is performed at the bottom of the page.
(But printing below <br>
the paper bottom should not disturb any correctly behaving
PCL printer.) Please remember that the correct paper tray
must be installed for selected paper size, so use this <br>
option only if you have full control over your print
destination.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-tpagenum <br>
Print pages with TeX page numbers less than or equal to
pagenum.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Verbose mode: list fonts
used, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Vmode <br>
Compatibility mode. As mode, use &quot;K&quot; for Kyocera,
&quot;B&quot; for Brother, 6 for LJ6 printers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w Omit warnings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-xoffset <br>
Global x-offset in mm on output page relative to 1 inch/1
inch origin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-yoffset <br>
Global y-offset in mm on output page relative to 1 inch/1
inch origin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Xoffset <br>
Global x-offset in dots on output page (overrides 1 inch/1
inch origin).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Yoffset <br>
Global y-offset in dots on output page (overrides 1 inch/1
inch origin).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z Print a test page with the
page counter at end of job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERANDS <br>
If no operands are specified a brief usage message is
displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">filename <br>
The DVI file name that shall be converted by dvilj. It must
always be seekable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The output file name is
constructed from filename. Either an extension
&quot;.dvi&quot; is replaced by &quot;.lj&quot;, or the
extension &quot;.lj&quot; is appended.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If filename is -, the DVI file
is read from standard input and the resulting PCL document
is written to standard output. (Please remember that thhe
DVI file must be seekable, <br>
even if it&rsquo;s stdin.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SUPPORTED TeX cial COMMANDS <br>
&quot;cial&quot; commands supported by dvilj have the
generic syntax</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cial{key1=value key1=&quot;value
with space&quot;} <br>
cial{key3 = value key4 = &rsquo;note optional spaces around
equal sign&rsquo;}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">I.e., specials are a sequence of
key/value pairs, separated by an equal sign. Spaces around
the equal sign are ignored. The value is either a space
separated word, or a quoted <br>
string. Both double and single quotes can be used,
alternatively. There is no support for quoting quote
characters in values; if you want both double and single
quotes in one <br>
value, you&rsquo;re out of luck.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following key/value
combinations are valid:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hpfile=file <br>
Insert file at the current position. file is searched with
kpathsea(3), see below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The file content must be valid
for this printer, i.e., it should contain PCL escape
sequences or HP-GL/2 commands. If the file is a graphics
file, this typically means that <br>
the upper left corner of the graphics is placed at the
current position.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PCL absolute positioning escape
sequences in file are rewritten to be relative positioning
commands; the lowest appearing coordinate is used as
reference.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hpfile_verbatim=file <br>
Insert file verbatim at the current position, without any
changes of the file content. file is searched with
kpathsea(3), see below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is mostly used to keep
absolute positions in PCL files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">psfile=file llx=x0 lly=y0 urx=x1
ury=y1 rwi=s <br>
Convert Postscript file file to HP PCL, by Ghostscript with
device &quot;ljetplus&quot;, and insert the resulting
graphics file at the current position, rewriting absolute
position <br>
escape sequences. file is searched with kpathsea(3), see
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The accompanying key/value pairs
are mandatory, they can be specified in an arbitrary order.
Values x0, x1, y0, y1, and s are integers. (x0,y0) is the
lower left corner, <br>
(x1,y1) the upper right corner of the image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please note: The specific
semantics of this special is not known. In particular, the
rwi parameter is some scale factor; but even looking at the
source code it is not quite <br>
clear what the special&rsquo;s author intended to implement
here. In addition, it is unclear what dimensions are used to
specify the corners, Postscript points or PCL dots.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you happen to know the psfile
semantics, or if you spent the work analyzing them, please
inform us at tex-k@tug.org, so that we can update this man
page with the relevant <br>
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dvilj-psfile-syntax=syntax <br>
where syntax is either &quot;dvilj&quot; or
&quot;ignore&quot;. This is a very crude way to tell the
driver what to do with psfile specials.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the value is
&quot;ignore&quot;, all psfile specials that are processed
afterwards are ignored, until the next dvilj-psfile-syntax
special is processed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the value is
&quot;dvilj&quot;, psfiles specials are processed as
explained above, until the next dvilj-psfile-syntax special
is processed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An obvious, planned, extension
is the value &quot;dvips&quot;, but this has not been
implemented yet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">That special is not as simple as
it sounds at first. Since its semantics is defined by
processing order, it is only of use if it is placed on the
same page as the psfile <br>
special. Having it once in a file (e.g., on the first page)
does not help if you print just one page of the document --
dvilj does not do prescanning of first-page specials <br>
like some other drivers do. (Patches would be welcome, of
course.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">comment=arbitrary text <br>
comment arbitrary text <br>
This causes the rest of the special to be ignored; it may be
used to add meta-information to a DVI file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With the first form, the comment
may appear anywhere in the special. When it appears first,
the processing of this special is terminated and all other
text behind is <br>
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The second form is a speciality
that has been introduced for compatibility with other
drivers. If the first keyword of the special is comment and
has no value, it is taken as <br>
a valid comment syntax, too; the rest of the special is
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">orientation=po <br>
Position the page on the physical paper. The value po may be
one of the following values:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 for portrait <br>
1 for landscape <br>
2 for reverse portrait <br>
3 for reverse landscape</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">defpoint=n(x,y) <br>
Define the point number n. This point can be referred to
later in other special commands to specify areas that shall
be filled with some pattern. n must be between 0 and 79.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">x and y are the position of that
point and have the form &quot;?pt&quot; where &quot;?&quot;
is a floating point number. The positions are relative to
the DVI page origin; i.e., coordinates <br>
increase moving right and down, the point of origin is
(1in,1in) in the upper left corner, altered by options -x,
-y, -X, and -Y, but not by fset and fset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">x and y can be omitted, i.e.,
the values 3 or &quot;4(,)&quot; are valid. Then the current
page position is used as position for point n.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">resetpoints=&quot;all&quot; <br>
This undefines all points again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gray=gray_scale <br>
grey=gray_scale <br>
This sets the fill mode for the next fill special, the area
will be filled with gray color. (grey is an alias for gray.)
Any pattern specification is reset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gray_scale is the percentage of
gray that shall be used here; with 0 meaning white and 100
meaning black.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Caveat: That special is actually
a misnomer. PCL names these gray scales shading patterns and
they are created by placing dots in the area. The gray scale
selects how far <br>
spread the dots are. In the lower ranges, this doesn&rsquo;t
look very gray on close sight, but more like a dotted
background. Furthermore, the gray scales are not as
fine-grained <br>
as the value range 0..100 might make you believe. In
reality, there are only 8 different gray patterns
available:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 - 2% <br>
3 - 10% <br>
11 - 20% <br>
21 - 35% <br>
36 - 55% <br>
56 - 80% <br>
81 - 99% <br>
100%</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One of these patterns is
selected according to the gray_scale value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pattern=pat <br>
This sets the fill mode for the next fill special, the area
will be filled with a pattern. Any gray color specification
is reset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pat is one of the following
values:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 horizontal lines <br>
2 vertical lines <br>
3 diagonal lines, from lower left corner to upper right
corner <br>
4 diagonal lines, from upper right corner to lower left
corner <br>
5 crossed lines, vertically <br>
6 crossed lines, diagonally</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fill=a/b <br>
Fill the area between the points a and b, according to the
current fill mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Point a must be the upper left
corner and point b must be the lower left corner of the
rectangle. Otherwise the result is garbage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default fill mode is 10%
gray color filling.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">filename <br>
This is a legacy special, its use is depreciated. If the
special is just one word that names an existing file, that
file is verbatim included. Contrary to other file <br>
inclusion means, the file is not searched with kpathsea(3).
You are not supposed to use this special and we won&rsquo;t
fix any problems with it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It should be noted that the
special parser does sometimes accept constructs that are not
valid as in the documentation above. Then, the output is
most often damaged in some way.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Searching for Included Files
<br>
Proper file include specials search the file with
kpathsea(3). The search path is configured by variable
&quot;DVILJINPUTS&quot; and, if the file is not found in
that search path, by <br>
variable &quot;TEXINPUTS&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Search via
&quot;DVILJINPUTS&quot; covers the use case that one has
common site-wide graphics that shall be included in
documents, e.g., scanned signatures. Search via
&quot;TEXINPUTS&quot; covers <br>
the use case that one has graphics as part of ones current
document.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;dvilj&quot; is used as the
&quot;.PROGRAM&quot; name in texmf.cnf, for all driver
variants, independent of the actual program name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unknown Specials and
&quot;TEX_HUSH&quot; configuration <br>
Kpathsea(3) has the concept of warning suppression with the
configuration variable &quot;TEX_HUSH&quot;, please refer to
its Info node TeX support / Suppressing warnings. That
variable <br>
holds a colon-separated identifiers that specifies the
to-be-suppressed warnings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If &quot;special&quot; is among
the listed values, dvilj does not output warnings any more
about specials that it doesn&rsquo;t know about. But if
there is a recognized special and if that <br>
special has an invalid parameter, then a warning is output
nevertheless, independent of the content of
&quot;TEX_HUSH&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DOUBLE PAGE PRINTING <br>
If the printer has a duplex unit installed, duplex printing
can be demanded with the -d option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Otherwise, the command line
option -D causes the printer to print in doublepage mode,
that is, roughly speaking, printing first the even pages and
then the odd pages of a <br>
document. If -D is used to print both even and odd pages (-D
is used without the optional 1 or 2) the following will
happen after half of the pages is printed: LJ: the printer
<br>
stops, shows message &quot;FEED&quot; and switches on manual
feed led. The printer continues when either the printed
pages are fed into the manual page feeder, or the operator
pushes the <br>
continue button (after placing first the printed pages into
the paper tray).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If -D1 was specified only odd
pages will be printed, -D2 can be used for even pages. A
trailing &quot;-&quot; (as in -D-, -D1- or -D2-) supresses
printing of empty pages which are <br>
generated for padding otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The driver allows the -D option
for both print-directions (front-to-back or back-to-front
printing). It tries to be clever in certain cases: when a
document has an odd number of <br>
pages it inserts in the right place an empty page when a
document starts with page 0 the driver inserts an empty page
after the 0-page when a piece of a document is printed that
<br>
starts with an even page-number it prints this page at the
backside of the first page to ensure that the odd sides are
always on the frontside. The 0-page is treated like an odd
<br>
page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The doubleside option works for
all LJs, not only for the new D model with does
doubleside-printing (actually, I don&rsquo;t know whether it
makes much sense on the new LJ II D at <br>
all).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Caveat on the doubleside-option:
When it is used frequently or on very large files, it might
become necessary to clean the printer much more
frequently.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The command line option -pX can
be used to abort printing after the output of X pages (can
lead to strange results together with -D). I personally
dislike this option. The secure <br>
way of printing a part of a document is using -f (from) and
-t (to).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
dvilj uses the same environment variables and algorithms for
finding font files as TeX and its friends do. See the
documentation for the kpathsea(3) library for details. <br>
(Repeating it here is too cumbersome.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;DVILJFONTS&quot; <br>
If set, overrides all other font paths.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;DVILJMAKEPK&quot; <br>
If set, overrides mktexpk(1) as the name of the command to
execute to create a PK file if one isn&rsquo;t found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;DVILJSIZES&quot; <br>
May be set to indicate which sizes of fonts are available.
It should consist of a list of numbers separated by colons.
If the list begins with a colon, the system default <br>
sizes are used, as well. Sizes are expressed in dots per
inch; decimals may be used for &quot;pxl&quot; files: for
example, a 300 dots per inch file magnified by half a step
comes out <br>
to 1643 dots per five inches, which should be encoded as
328.6. dvilj tries the actual size of the font before trying
any of the given sizes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;DVILJINPUTS&quot; <br>
Primary search path for include files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;TEXINPUTS&quot; <br>
Secondary search path for include files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;TEX_HUSH&quot; <br>
Colon separated list of identifiers that name situations
where no warning shall be output. The following identifiers
are used:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">checksum suppress mismatched
font checksum warnings <br>
readable suppress warnings about unreadable files <br>
special suppress warnings about unknown specials <br>
all suppress all warning classes above <br>
none suppress no warnings</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;KPATHSEA_DEBUG&quot; <br>
Trace kpathsea(3) lookups; set to -1 for complete
tracing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;GS_PATH&quot; <br>
On Windows, this may be the path to Ghostscript; there the
default is gswin32c.exe.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On Unix, this environment
variable is not used. Ghostscript is called as gs(1) and
must be found over $PATH.</p>
