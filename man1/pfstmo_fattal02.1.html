<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This command implements a tone mapping operator as described
in:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Gradient Domain High Dynamic
Range Compression R. Fattal, D. Lischinski, and M. Werman In
ACM Transactions on Graphics, 31(3), p. 249, 2002.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With respect to the original
paper, this program provides additional parameter which
limits the amplification of noise. The noise is often
starkly amplified because of division <br>
by zero in one of the equations in the paper. Extension
contributed by Przemyslaw Bazarnik.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At the core of the programme is
a Poisson PDE which as suggested in the original paper is
solved using a Full Multigrid Algorithm. However, this is an
iterative solver which <br>
seems to lose accuracy when applied to higher resolution
images resulting in halo effects and surreal looking images.
For that reason a second solver has been implemented using
<br>
the discrete cosine transform as the underlying method and
is considerably more accurate mainly because it is a direct
solver. This solver is the preferred method and is used by
<br>
default. The old multigrid solver can be selected with the
--multigrid (-m) option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
--alpha &lt;val&gt;, -a &lt;val&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Set alpha parameter. This
parameter is depreciated as setting a &lt;val&gt; other than
1.0 has only the effect of a global gamma adjustment of the
luminance channel which can be <br>
directly specified using the --gamma option. See the paper
for the definition of alpha. It can be shown, although not
mentioned in the paper, that setting alpha other than <br>
1.0 has the same effect as setting gamma =
alpha^(k*(1-beta)), where beta is the value as specified by
--beta and k is the number of levels of the Gaussian Pyramid
(see <br>
paper for details), which depends on the image pixel size
(smallest k so that 2^(k+detail_level) &gt;=
min(width,height)/MSIZE, MSIZE see source code, e.g. 8 or
32).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--beta &lt;val&gt;, -b
&lt;val&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Set beta parameter. &lt;val&gt;
sets the strength of gradient (local contrast) modification.
Suggested range is 0.8 to 0.96, default is 0.9 (see paper
for details). Value of 1 <br>
does not change contrasts, values above 1 reverse the
effect: local contrast is stretched and details are
attenuated. Values below 0.5 lead to very strong
amplification <br>
of small contrast, so consider using --noise parameter to
prevent noise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--gamma &lt;val&gt;, -g
&lt;val&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Set luminance gamma adjustment.
This can be described as a global contrast enhancement and
is applied after the local enhancement as specified by the
parameter --beta is <br>
performed. Gamma adjustment or correction is defined by a
power-law, in this case <br>
L_out(x,y) = L_in(x,y)^gamma, where L_in(x,y)=exp(I(x,y)) is
the luminance value after the local contrast enhancement (I
is the solution of the Poisson PDE). The sug&acirc; <br>
gested range for &lt;val&gt; is 0.6 to 1.0, default is
0.8.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--saturation &lt;val&gt;, -s
&lt;val&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Amount of color saturation.
Suggested range is 0.4 to 0.8. Default value: 0.8.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--noise &lt;val&gt;, -n
&lt;val&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Reduces the gradient
amplification value for gradients close to 0 and reduces
noise as a result. &lt;val&gt; defines gradient value
(luminance difference of adjacent pixels) <br>
which is treated as noise. Suggested range is 0.0 to the
value of alpha. Default value calculated based on alpha:
0.001*alpha.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--detail-level &lt;val&gt;, -d
&lt;val&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specifies up to which detail
level the local contrast enhancement should be performed. It
basically means that local contrast levels within small
squares of pixel size <br>
2^&lt;val&gt; are not changed. In the implementation this
corresponds to removing the &lt;val&gt; finest levels of the
Gaussian Pyramid as described in the paper, i.e. the paper
only <br>
considers &lt;val&gt;=0. Suggested values are 1, 2 or 3; 3
for high resolution images. The default is 3 for
--fftsolver, and 0 if the original multi-level solver is
used (to be <br>
consistent with the paper).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--white-point &lt;val&gt;, -w
&lt;val&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specifies the percentage of
pixels which are allowed to be overexposed and therefore
blown out. This can be useful for example when there is a
very bright object in the <br>
image like the sun and details of it do not need to be
resolved. As a result the overall image will look brighter
the greater &lt;val&gt; is. Default is 0.5.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--black-point &lt;val&gt;, -k
&lt;val&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Same as --white-point but for
under-exposed pixels. Default is 0.1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--multigrid, -m</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enable the use of the multigrid
solver as suggested by the original paper. For accuracy the
default fft solver is generally recommended especially when
using high resolu&acirc; <br>
tion images. The user will benefit by obtaining
photo-realistic rather than surreal looking images. The fft
solver is also faster despite the fact it is only O(n*log n)
<br>
with n=width*height, as compared to O(n) for the multigrid
solver. The speed improvement is thanks to the very
efficient fftw3 library which is used to calculate the
dis&acirc; <br>
crete cosine transform.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KNOWN ISSUES <br>
For stronger local contrast enhancements (beta&lt;0.9) the
fft solver (--fftsolver) might produce slightly dark image
corners. This can be mitigated using bigger values for the
<br>
--noise parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With a value of --detail-level
greater than 0, the internal implementation could be made
much more efficient as only a reduced sized PDE would need
to be solved, greatly improv&acirc; <br>
ing speed.</p>
