<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
dcmpschk - Checking tool for presentation states</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
dcmpschk [options] [dcmfile-in...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The dcmpschk utility checks DICOM Grayscale Softcopy
Presentation State objects for conformance with the
standard. The test is performed in three phases:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Phase 1 checks
the Meta-header of the DICOM file. It is tested whether all
required attributes are present, whether the SOP class and
instance UIDs match the UIDs in the main <br>
object and whether the group length attribute contains a
correct value. The Transfer Syntax of the Meta header is
also checked. <br>
&Acirc;&middot; Phase 2 performs a syntactic check of the
values, value representations and value multiplicities for
each attribute in the object. The values present in the
object under test <br>
are compared with the definitions of the DICOM data
dictionary. <br>
&Acirc;&middot; Phase 3 performs a semantic check of the
integrity of the Presentation State. This phase is omitted
when objects of other SOP Classes are encountered. Phase 1
and 2 can also be <br>
applied to other DICOM objects of arbitrary SOP class. It
should be noted that dcmpschk does not support Presentation
States which contain the Mask Module. These will be <br>
rejected with a message that the Mask Module is not
supported. PARAMETERS <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ll --log-level [l]evel: string
constant <br>

use level l for the logger</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-lc --log-config [f]ilename:
string <br>
use config file f for the logger LOGGING <br>
The level of logging output of the various command line
tools and underlying libraries can be specified by the user.
By default, only errors and warnings are written to the <br>
standard error stream. Using option --verbose also
informational messages like processing details are reported.
Option --debug can be used to get more details on the
internal <br>
activity, e.g. for debugging purposes. Other logging levels
can be selected using option --log-level. In --quiet mode
only fatal errors are reported. In such very severe error
<br>
events, the application will usually terminate. For more
details on the different logging levels, see documentation
of module &rsquo;oflog&rsquo;. <br>
In case the logging output should be written to file
(optionally with logfile rotation), to syslog (Unix) or the
event log (Windows) option --log-config can be used. This
<br>
configuration file also allows for directing only certain
messages to a particular output stream and for filtering
certain messages based on the module or application where
they <br>
are generated. An example configuration file is provided in
&lt;etcdir&gt;/logger.cfg. COMMAND LINE <br>
All command line tools use the following notation for
parameters: square brackets enclose optional values (0-1),
three trailing dots indicate that multiple values are
allowed <br>
(1-n), a combination of both means 0 to n values. <br>
Command line options are distinguished from parameters by a
leading &rsquo;+&rsquo; or &rsquo;-&rsquo; sign,
respectively. Usually, order and position of command line
options are arbitrary (i.e. they <br>
can appear anywhere). However, if options are mutually
exclusive the rightmost appearance is used. This behavior
conforms to the standard evaluation rules of common Unix
shells. <br>
In addition, one or more command files can be specified
using an &rsquo;@&rsquo; sign as a prefix to the filename
(e.g. @command.txt). Such a command argument is replaced by
the content of <br>
the corresponding text file (multiple whitespaces are
treated as a single separator unless they appear between two
quotation marks) prior to any further evaluation. Please
note <br>
that a command file cannot contain another command file.
This simple but effective approach allows one to summarize
common combinations of options/parameters and avoids longish
<br>
and confusing command lines (an example is provided in file
&lt;datadir&gt;/dumppat.txt). ENVIRONMENT <br>
The dcmpschk utility will attempt to load DICOM data
dictionaries specified in the DCMDICTPATH environment
variable. By default, i.e. if the DCMDICTPATH environment
variable is <br>
not set, the file &lt;datadir&gt;/dicom.dic will be loaded
unless the dictionary is built into the application (default
for Windows). <br>
The default behavior should be preferred and the DCMDICTPATH
environment variable only used when alternative data
dictionaries are required. The DCMDICTPATH environment
variable <br>
has the same format as the Unix shell PATH variable in that
a colon (&rsquo;:&rsquo;) separates entries. On Windows
systems, a semicolon (&rsquo;;&rsquo;) is used as a
separator. The data dictionary <br>
code will attempt to load each file specified in the
DCMDICTPATH environment variable. It is an error if no data
dictionary can be loaded. COPYRIGHT <br>
