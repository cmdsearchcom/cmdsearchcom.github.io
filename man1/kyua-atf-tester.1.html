<p>KYUA-ATF-TESTER(1) BSD General Commands Manual
KYUA-ATF-TESTER(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
kyua-atf-tester &acirc; Scriptable interface to interact
with ATF test programs</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
kyua-atf-tester [generic_flags] subcommand
[subcommand_flags] [subcommand_args]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
kyua-atf-tester provides a scriptable interface to interact
with test programs that implement the kyua-atf-interface(7)
test interface. This manual page describes the specific <br>
features that apply to this specific tester. For the generic
manual page, which describes the command-line interface in
detail, please see kyua-tester(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Results conversion <br>
The result format outputted by kyua-atf-tester (described in
kyua-tester-result(5)) is more restricted than what the ATF
test case itself can output. The following list details <br>
maps ATF test results to their generic results:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">expected_death Maps to
&acirc;expected_failure&acirc; if the death happens;
&acirc;failed&acirc; otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">expected_exit Maps to
&acirc;expected_failure&acirc; if the test exits cleanly;
&acirc;failed&acirc; otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">expected_failure Maps to
&acirc;expected_failure&acirc; if there is any failure
during the execution; &acirc;failed&acirc; otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">expected_signal Maps to
&acirc;expected_failure&acirc; if the test terminates due to
a signal; &acirc;failed&acirc; otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">expected_timeout Maps to
&acirc;expected_failure&acirc; if the test times out;
&acirc;failed&acirc; otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">failed Maps to
&acirc;failed&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">passed Maps to
&acirc;passed&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">skipped Maps to
&acirc;skipped&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any of the previous test results
can also map to &acirc;broken&acirc; in those cases where
there is an unexpected problem in the communcation between
the test and kyua-atf-tester. For exam&acirc; <br>
ple, this will happen if result file created by the ATF test
case does not comply to what kyua-atf-interface(7)
describes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cleanup routines <br>
Because kyua-atf-tester cannot keep any contextual
information between the listing of test cases and their
execution, the tester cannot easily (aka cheaply) know
whether a test has <br>
or has not a cleanup routine when it is run. For this
reason, the &acirc;test&acirc; subcommand of kyua-atf-tester
will assume, by default, that a test case does have a
cleanup routine. This <br>
postive assumption ensures that, if the tester is
incorrectly executed, the test will be properly cleaned
up.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, as an optimization, the
caller can pass &acirc;-v has_cleanup=false&acirc; to the
&acirc;test&acirc; subcommand to tell kyua-atf-tester that
the test being run does not have a cleanup routine.</p>
