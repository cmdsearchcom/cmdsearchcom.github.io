<p>lprng_certs(1) lprng_certs command lprng_certs(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
lprng_certs - lprng SSL certificate management</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
lprng_certs option <br>
Options: <br>
init - make directory structure <br>
newca - make new root CA <br>
defaults - set new default values for certs <br>
gen - generate user, server, or signing cert <br>
index [dir] - index cert files <br>
verify [cert] - verify cert file <br>
encrypt keyfile <br>
- set or change keyfile password</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The lprng_certs program is used to manage SSL certificates
for the LPRng software. There SSL certificate structure
consists of a hierarchy of certificates. The LPRng software
<br>
assumes that the following types of certificates will be
used:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CA or root <br>
A top level or self-signed certificate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">signing <br>
A certificate that can be used to sign other certificates.
This is signed by the root CA or another signing
certificate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">user A certificate used by a
user to identify themselves to the lpd server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">server A certificate used by the
lpd server to identify themselves to the user or other lpd
servers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Signing Certificates <br>
All of the signing certificates, including the root
certificate (root CA), /etc/lprng/ssl.ca/ca.crt, are in the
same directory as the root CA file. Alternately, all of the
sign&acirc; <br>
ing certs can be concatenated and put into a single file,
which by convention is assumed to have the same name as the
root CA file, /etc/lprng/ssl.ca/ca.crt. The ssl_ca_file,
<br>
ssl_ca_path, and ssl_ca_key printcap and configuration
options can be used to specify the locations of the root CA
files, a directory containing the signing certificate files,
<br>
and the private key file for the root CA file
respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The root certificate (root CA
file) /etc/lprng/ssl.ca/ca.crt has a private key file
/etc/lprng/ssl.ca/ca.key as well. By convention, the private
keys for the other signing cer&acirc; <br>
tificate files are stored in the certificate file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The OpenSSL software requires
that this directory also contain a set of hash files which
are, in effect, links to these files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, all signing
certificates are assumed to be in the same directory as the
root certificate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Server Certificates <br>
The certificate used by the lpd server are kept in another
directory. These files do not need to have hash links to
them. By convention, the private keys for these certificate
<br>
files are stored in the certificate file. The server
certificate file is specified by the ssl_server_cert and has
the default value /etc/lprng/ssl.server/server.crt. This
file <br>
contains the cert and private key. The server certificate
password file is specified by the ssl_server_password option
with the default value</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and contains the password used
to decrypt the servers private key and use it for
authentication. This key file should be read only by the lpd
server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">User Certificates <br>
The certificates used by users are kept in a separate
directory in the users home directory. By convention, the
private keys for these certificate files are stored in the
cer&acirc; <br>
tificate file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The user certificate file is
specified by the LPR_SSL_FILE environment variable,
otherwise the ${HOME}/.lpr/client.crt is used. The password
is taken from the file specified by <br>
the LPR_SSL_PASSWORD environment variable, otherwise the
${HOME}/.lpr/client.pwd file is read.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USING LPRNG_CERTS <br>
The organization of the SSL certificates used by LPRng is
similar to that used by other programs such as the Apache
mod_ssl support. The lprng_certs program is used to create
<br>
the directory structure, create certificates for the root
CA, signing, user and servers. In order to make management
simple, the following support is provided.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lprng_certs init <br>
This command creates the directories used by the lpd server.
It is useful when setting up a new lpd server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lprng_certs newca <br>
This command creates a self-signed certificate, suitable for
use as a root CA certificate. It also sets up a set of
default values for other certificate creation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lprng_certs defaults <br>
This command is used to modify the set of default
values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default values are listed
and should be self-explanatory, except for the value of the
signer certificate. By default, the root CA can be used to
sign certificates. However, <br>
a signing certificate can be used as well. This allows
delegation of signing authority without compromising the
security of the root CA.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lprng_certs gen <br>
This is used to generate a user, server, or signing
certificate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lprng_certs index <br>
This is used to create the indexes for the signing
certificates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lprng_certs verify [cert] <br>
This checks the certificate file using the Openssl openssl
verify command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lprng_certs encrypt keyfile <br>
This removes all key information from the key file,
reencrypts the key information, and the puts the encrypted
key information in the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LPRng OPTIONS <br>
Option Purpose <br>
ssl_ca_path directory holding the SSL signing certs <br>
ssl_ca_file file holding the root CA or all SSL signing
certs <br>
ssl_server_cert cert file for the server <br>
ssl_server_password file containing password for server
server <br>
${HOME}/.lpr/client.crt client certificate file <br>
${HOME}/.lpr/client.pwd client certificate private key
password</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
LPR_SSL_FILE client certificate file <br>
LPR_SSL_PASSWORD client certificate private key password</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The following exit values are returned:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zero (0) Successful
completion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">non-zero (!=0) An error
occurred.</p>
