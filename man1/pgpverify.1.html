pgpverify - Cryptographically verify Usenet control messages
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<b>pgpverify</b> [<b>--findid</b>=<i>string</i>] [<b>--test</b>] &lt;
  <i>message</i>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
The <b>pgpverify</b> program reads (on standard input) a Usenet control message
  that has been cryptographically signed using the <b>signcontrol</b> program
  (or some other program that produces a compatible format). <b>pgpverify</b>
  then uses a PGP implementation to determine who signed the control message. If
  the control message has a valid signature, <b>pgpverify</b> prints (to stdout)
  the user ID of the key that signed the message. Otherwise, it exits with a
  non-zero exit status.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If <b>pgpverify</b> is installed as part of INN, it uses INN's configuration to
  determine what signature verification program to use, how to log errors, what
  temporary directory to use, and what keyring to use. Otherwise, all of those
  parameters can be set by editing the beginning of this script.
<div class="Pp"></div>
By default, when running as part of INN, <b>pgpverify</b> expects the PGP key
  ring to be found in <i>pathetc</i>/pgp (as either <i>pubring.pgp</i> or
  <i>pubring.gpg</i> depending on whether PGP or GnuPG is used to verify
  signatures). If that directory doesn't exist, it will fall back on using the
  default key ring, which is in a <i>.pgp</i> or <i>.gnupg</i> subdirectory of
  the running user's home directory.
<div class="Pp"></div>
INN, when using GnuPG, configures <b>pgpverify</b> to use <b>gpgv</b>, which by
  default expects keys to be in a keyring named <i>trustedkeys.gpg</i>, since it
  doesn't implement trust checking directly. <b>pgpverify</b> uses that file if
  present but falls back to <i>pubring.gpg</i> if it's not found. This bypasses
  the trust model for checking keys, but is compatible with the way that
  <b>pgpverify</b> used to behave. Of course, if a keyring is found in
  <i>pathetc</i>/pgp or configured at the top of the script, that overrides all
  of this behavior.

      a given one is defined on this key. In case the signature is valid but

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ENVIRONMENT"><a class="selflink" href="#ENVIRONMENT">ENVIRONMENT</a></h1>
<b>pgpverify</b> does not modify or otherwise alter the environment before
  invoking the <b>pgp</b> or <b>gpgv</b> program. It is the responsibility of
  the person who installs <b>pgpverify</b> to ensure that when <b>pgp</b> or
  <b>gpgv</b> runs, it has the ability to locate and read a PGP key file that
  contains the PGP public keys for the appropriate Usenet hierarchy
  administrators. <b>pgpverify</b> can be pointed to an appropriate key ring by
  editing variables at the beginning of this script.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="NOTES"><a class="selflink" href="#NOTES">NOTES</a></h1>
Historically, Usenet news server administrators have configured their news
  servers to automatically honor Usenet control messages based on the originator
  of the control messages and the hierarchies for which the control messages
  applied. For example, in the past, David Lawrence always issued control
  messages for the &quot;Big&#x00A0;8&quot; hierarchies (comp, humanities, misc,
  news, rec, sci, soc, talk). Usenet news administrators would configure their
  news server software to automatically honor newgroup and rmgroup control
  messages that originated from David Lawrence and applied to any of the
  Big&#x00A0;8 hierarchies.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Unfortunately, Usenet news articles (including control messages) are notoriously
  easy to forge. Soon, malicious users realized they could create or remove (at
  least temporarily) any Big&#x00A0;8 newsgroup they wanted by simply forging an
  appropriate control message in David Lawrence's name. As Usenet became more
  widely used, forgeries became more common.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>pgpverify</b> program was designed to allow Usenet news administrators to
  configure their servers to cryptographically verify control messages before
  automatically acting on them. Under the <b>pgpverify</b> system, a Usenet
  hierarchy maintainer creates a PGP public/private key pair and disseminates
  the public key. Whenever the hierarchy maintainer issues a control message, he
  uses the <b>signcontrol</b> program to sign the control message with the PGP
  private key. Usenet news administrators configure their news servers to run
  the <b>pgpverify</b> program on the appropriate control messages, and take
  action based on the PGP key User ID that signed the control message, not the
  name and address that appear in the control message's From: or Sender:
  headers.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Thus, appropriate use of the <b>signcontrol</b> and <b>pgpverify</b> programs
  essentially eliminates the possibility of malicious users forging Usenet
  control messages that sites will act upon, as such users would have to obtain
  the PGP private key in order to forge a control message that would pass the
  cryptographic verification step. If the hierarchy administrators properly
  protect their PGP private keys, the only way a malicious user could forge a
  validly-signed control message would be by breaking the public key encryption
  algorithm, which (at least at this time) is believed to be prohibitively
  difficult for PGP keys of a sufficient bit length.
