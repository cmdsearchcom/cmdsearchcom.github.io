<p>PGPVERIFY(1) InterNetNews Documentation PGPVERIFY(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pgpverify - Cryptographically verify Usenet control
messages</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pgpverify [--findid=string] [--test] &lt; message</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The pgpverify program reads (on standard input) a Usenet
control message that has been cryptographically signed using
the signcontrol program (or some other program that produces
<br>
a compatible format). pgpverify then uses a PGP
implementation to determine who signed the control message.
If the control message has a valid signature, pgpverify
prints (to <br>
stdout) the user ID of the key that signed the message.
Otherwise, it exits with a non-zero exit status.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If pgpverify is installed as
part of INN, it uses INN&rsquo;s configuration to determine
what signature verification program to use, how to log
errors, what temporary directory to use, <br>
and what keyring to use. Otherwise, all of those parameters
can be set by editing the beginning of this script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, when running as part
of INN, pgpverify expects the PGP key ring to be found in
pathetc/pgp (as either pubring.pgp or pubring.gpg depending
on whether PGP or GnuPG is <br>
used to verify signatures). If that directory doesn&rsquo;t
exist, it will fall back on using the default key ring,
which is in a .pgp or .gnupg subdirectory of the running
user&rsquo;s <br>
home directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INN, when using GnuPG,
configures pgpverify to use gpgv, which by default expects
keys to be in a keyring named trustedkeys.gpg, since it
doesn&rsquo;t implement trust checking <br>
directly. pgpverify uses that file if present but falls back
to pubring.gpg if it&rsquo;s not found. This bypasses the
trust model for checking keys, but is compatible with the
way <br>
that pgpverify used to behave. Of course, if a keyring is
found in pathetc/pgp or configured at the top of the script,
that overrides all of this behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
--findid=string <br>
The --findid flag causes pgpverify to explicitly search for
string in the output from PGP&rsquo;s analysis of the
message. This option is useful when several UIDs are defined
on a <br>
single PGP key, and the caller to pgpverify needs checking
whether a given one is defined on this key. In case the
signature is valid but does not contain string, pgpverify
<br>
exits with exit status 4.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--test <br>
The --test flag causes pgpverify to print out the input that
it is passing to PGP (which is a reconstructed version of
the input that supposedly created the control message) <br>
as well as the output from PGP&rsquo;s analysis of the
message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
pgpverify may exit with the following statuses:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 The control message had a good
PGP signature.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 The control message had no PGP
signature.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 The control message had an
unknown PGP signature.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3 The control message had a bad
PGP signature.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4 The control message had a good
PGP signature but the argument given to the --findid flag
had non been found in the output from PGP&rsquo;s analysis
of the message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">255 A problem occurred not
directly related to PGP analysis of signature.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
pgpverify does not modify or otherwise alter the environment
before invoking the pgp or gpgv program. It is the
responsibility of the person who installs pgpverify to
ensure <br>
that when pgp or gpgv runs, it has the ability to locate and
read a PGP key file that contains the PGP public keys for
the appropriate Usenet hierarchy administrators. pgpverify
<br>
can be pointed to an appropriate key ring by editing
variables at the beginning of this script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
Historically, Usenet news server administrators have
configured their news servers to automatically honor Usenet
control messages based on the originator of the control
messages <br>
and the hierarchies for which the control messages applied.
For example, in the past, David Lawrence always issued
control messages for the &quot;Big 8&quot; hierarchies
(comp, <br>
humanities, misc, news, rec, sci, soc, talk). Usenet news
administrators would configure their news server software to
automatically honor newgroup and rmgroup control messages
<br>
that originated from David Lawrence and applied to any of
the Big 8 hierarchies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unfortunately, Usenet news
articles (including control messages) are notoriously easy
to forge. Soon, malicious users realized they could create
or remove (at least temporarily) <br>
any Big 8 newsgroup they wanted by simply forging an
appropriate control message in David Lawrence&rsquo;s name.
As Usenet became more widely used, forgeries became more
common.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The pgpverify program was
designed to allow Usenet news administrators to configure
their servers to cryptographically verify control messages
before automatically acting on <br>
them. Under the pgpverify system, a Usenet hierarchy
maintainer creates a PGP public/private key pair and
disseminates the public key. Whenever the hierarchy
maintainer issues <br>
a control message, he uses the signcontrol program to sign
the control message with the PGP private key. Usenet news
administrators configure their news servers to run the <br>
pgpverify program on the appropriate control messages, and
take action based on the PGP key User ID that signed the
control message, not the name and address that appear in the
<br>
control message&rsquo;s From: or Sender: headers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Thus, appropriate use of the
signcontrol and pgpverify programs essentially eliminates
the possibility of malicious users forging Usenet control
messages that sites will act <br>
upon, as such users would have to obtain the PGP private key
in order to forge a control message that would pass the
cryptographic verification step. If the hierarchy <br>
administrators properly protect their PGP private keys, the
only way a malicious user could forge a validly-signed
control message would be by breaking the public key
encryption <br>
algorithm, which (at least at this time) is believed to be
prohibitively difficult for PGP keys of a sufficient bit
length.</p>
