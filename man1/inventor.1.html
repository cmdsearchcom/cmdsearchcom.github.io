Inventor - a toolkit for writing 3D programs
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
The <i>Open Inventor 3D Toolkit</i> is an object-oriented toolkit that
  simplifies and abstracts the task of writing graphics programming into a set
  of easy to use objects. These objects range from low-level data-centered
  objects such as Sphere, Camera, Material, Light, and Group, to high-level
  application-level objects such as Walk Viewer and Material Editor. The
  foundation concept in Inventor is the &quot;scene database&quot; which defines
  the objects to be used in an application. When using Inventor, a programmer
  creates, edits, and composes these objects into hierarchical 3D scene graphs
  (i.e. database). A variety of fundamental application tasks such as rendering,
  picking, event handling, and file reading/writing are built-in operations of
  all objects in the database and thus are simple to invoke.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Since Inventor is object-oriented (written in C++), it encourages programmers to
  extend the system by writing new objects. Inventor users have created a
  variety of new objects that are not included in the product, such as: Bezier
  surfaces, CSG objects, animation objects, special viewers, and many more.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that the rendering mechanism inside Inventor objects employs OpenGL. Thus,
  during rendering each object automatically makes the proper, efficient calls
  to OpenGL. Furthermore, Inventor rendering supports a caching scheme which
  automatically generates very fast renderings of the database without traversal
  overheads.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Inventor picking is extremely efficient and does not utilize rendering.
  Furthermore, picking returns a variety of 3D information and detail about what
  objects were picked. A sorted list of picked objects and corresponding
  information is returned to the programmer. Picking is so fast that programs
  can perform 3D locate highlighting as the mouse moves across a 3D window.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="INTERACTION,_EVENTS,_AND_DEVICES"><a class="selflink" href="#INTERACTION,_EVENTS,_AND_DEVICES">INTERACTION,
  EVENTS, AND DEVICES</a></h1>
Inventor defines a event model for writing 3D interaction. This model is window
  system independent. It is quite easy to use and makes 3D direct manipulation
  programming possible. Inventor includes a variety of interactive 3D objects
  and tools for writing interactive objects, such as: Manipulators, Draggers,
  and Projectors. The flexible event model encourages programmers to extend the
  system to support new devices and event types.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="FILE_FORMAT"><a class="selflink" href="#FILE_FORMAT">FILE
  FORMAT</a></h1>
The Inventor 3D File Format is SGI's standard for 3D data. The format supports
  both an ASCII and private binary format. The binary format is network-neutral
  and thus can be exported across machine boundaries.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="BENEFITS"><a class="selflink" href="#BENEFITS">BENEFITS</a></h1>
Programming 3D graphics applications with Inventor results in large-scale
  productivity increases. This also increases with time as more tools utilize
  the Inventor paradigm, user interfaces, and standard file format.

A list of online documentation is available in the General FAQ section of the
  web site provided at the end of this man page.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SOURCE_CODE"><a class="selflink" href="#SOURCE_CODE">SOURCE
  CODE</a></h1>
The Inventor Toolkit includes source code to NUMEROUS programs and examples.
