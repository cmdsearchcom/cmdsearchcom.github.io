<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
Inventor - a toolkit for writing 3D programs</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The Open Inventor 3D Toolkit is an object-oriented toolkit
that simplifies and abstracts the task of writing graphics
programming into a set of easy to use objects. These <br>
objects range from low-level data-centered objects such as
Sphere, Camera, Material, Light, and Group, to high-level
application-level objects such as Walk Viewer and Material
<br>
Editor. The foundation concept in Inventor is the
&quot;scene database&quot; which defines the objects to be
used in an application. When using Inventor, a programmer
creates, edits, and <br>
composes these objects into hierarchical 3D scene graphs
(i.e. database). A variety of fundamental application tasks
such as rendering, picking, event handling, and file
read&acirc; <br>
ing/writing are built-in operations of all objects in the
database and thus are simple to invoke.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since Inventor is
object-oriented (written in C++), it encourages programmers
to extend the system by writing new objects. Inventor users
have created a variety of new objects <br>
that are not included in the product, such as: Bezier
surfaces, CSG objects, animation objects, special viewers,
and many more.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the rendering
mechanism inside Inventor objects employs OpenGL. Thus,
during rendering each object automatically makes the proper,
efficient calls to OpenGL. Further&acirc; <br>
more, Inventor rendering supports a caching scheme which
automatically generates very fast renderings of the database
without traversal overheads.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Inventor picking is extremely
efficient and does not utilize rendering. Furthermore,
picking returns a variety of 3D information and detail about
what objects were picked. A <br>
sorted list of picked objects and corresponding information
is returned to the programmer. Picking is so fast that
programs can perform 3D locate highlighting as the mouse
moves <br>
across a 3D window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INTERACTION, EVENTS, AND DEVICES
<br>
Inventor defines a event model for writing 3D interaction.
This model is window system independent. It is quite easy to
use and makes 3D direct manipulation programming
possi&acirc; <br>
ble. Inventor includes a variety of interactive 3D objects
and tools for writing interactive objects, such as:
Manipulators, Draggers, and Projectors. The flexible event
model <br>
encourages programmers to extend the system to support new
devices and event types.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILE FORMAT <br>
The Inventor 3D File Format is SGI&rsquo;s standard for 3D
data. The format supports both an ASCII and private binary
format. The binary format is network-neutral and thus can be
<br>
exported across machine boundaries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BENEFITS <br>
Programming 3D graphics applications with Inventor results
in large-scale productivity increases. This also increases
with time as more tools utilize the Inventor paradigm, user
<br>
interfaces, and standard file format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DOCUMENTATION <br>
A list of online documentation is available in the General
FAQ section of the web site provided at the end of this man
page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SOURCE CODE <br>
The Inventor Toolkit includes source code to NUMEROUS
programs and examples.</p>

qmorf, revo, showcase, textomatic</p>
