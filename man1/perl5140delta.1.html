perl5140delta - what is new for perl v5.14.0
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
This document describes differences between the 5.12.0 release and the 5.14.0
  release.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.10.0, first read
  perl5120delta, which describes differences between 5.10.0 and 5.12.0.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Some of the bug fixes in this release have been backported to subsequent
  releases of 5.12.x. Those are indicated with the 5.12.x version in
  parentheses.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Notice"><a class="selflink" href="#Notice">Notice</a></h1>
As described in perlpolicy, the release of Perl 5.14.0 marks the official end of
  support for Perl 5.10. Users of Perl 5.10 or earlier should consider upgrading
  to a more recent release of Perl.

<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Unicode"><a class="selflink" href="#Unicode">Unicode</a></h2>
<i>Unicode Version 6.0 is now supported (mostly)</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Perl comes with the Unicode 6.0 data base updated with Corrigendum #8
  &lt;http://www.unicode.org/versions/corrigendum8.html&gt;, with one exception
  noted below. See &lt;http://unicode.org/versions/Unicode6.0.0/&gt; for details
  on the new release. Perl does not support any Unicode provisional properties,
  including the new ones for this release.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Unicode 6.0 has chosen to use the name &quot;BELL&quot; for the character at
  U+1F514, which is a symbol that looks like a bell, and is used in Japanese
  cell phones. This conflicts with the long-standing Perl usage of having
  &quot;BELL&quot; mean the ASCII &quot;BEL&quot; character, U+0007. In Perl
  5.14, &quot;\N{BELL}&quot; continues to mean U+0007, but its use generates a
  deprecation warning message unless such warnings are turned off. The new name
  for U+0007 in Perl is &quot;ALERT&quot;, which corresponds nicely with the
  existing shorthand sequence for it, &quot;\a&quot;. &quot;\N{BEL}&quot; means
  U+0007, with no warning given. The character at U+1F514 has no name in 5.14,
  but can be referred to by &quot;\N{U+1F514}&quot;. In Perl 5.16,
  &quot;\N{BELL}&quot; will refer to U+1F514; all code that uses
  &quot;\N{BELL}&quot; should be converted to use &quot;\N{ALERT}&quot;,
  &quot;\N{BEL}&quot;, or &quot;\a&quot; before upgrading.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Full functionality for </i><i>&quot;use feature
  'unicode_strings'&quot;</i><i></i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This release provides full functionality for &quot;use feature
  'unicode_strings'&quot;. Under its scope, all string operations executed and
  regular expressions compiled (even if executed outside its scope) have Unicode
  semantics. See &quot;the 'unicode_strings' feature&quot; in feature. However,
  see &quot;Inverted bracketed character classes and multi-character
  folds&quot;, below.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This feature avoids most forms of the &quot;Unicode Bug&quot; (see &quot;The
  &quot;Unicode Bug&quot;&quot; in perlunicode for details). If there is any
  possibility that your code will process Unicode strings, you are
  <i>strongly</i> encouraged to use this subpragma to avoid nasty surprises.

<div class="Pp"></div>
See charnames for details on all these changes.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>New warnings categories for problematic (non-)Unicode code points.</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Three new warnings subcategories of &quot;utf8&quot; have been added. These
  allow you to turn off some &quot;utf8&quot; warnings, while allowing other
  warnings to remain on. The three categories are: &quot;surrogate&quot; when
  UTF-16 surrogates are encountered; &quot;nonchar&quot; when Unicode
  non-character code points are encountered; and &quot;non_unicode&quot; when
  code points above the legal Unicode maximum of 0x10FFFF are encountered.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Any unsigned value can be encoded as a character</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
With this release, Perl is adopting a model that any unsigned value can be
  treated as a code point and encoded internally (as utf8) without warnings, not
  just the code points that are legal in Unicode. However, unless utf8 or the
  corresponding sub-category (see previous item) of lexical warnings have been
  explicitly turned off, outputting or executing a Unicode-defined operation
  such as upper-casing on such a code point generates a warning. Attempting to
  input these using strict rules (such as with the &quot;:encoding(UTF-8)&quot;
  layer) will continue to fail. Prior to this release, handling was inconsistent
  and in places, incorrect.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Unicode non-characters, some of which previously were erroneously considered
  illegal in places by Perl, contrary to the Unicode Standard, are now always
  legal internally. Inputting or outputting them works the same as with the
  non-legal Unicode code points, because the Unicode Standard says they are
  (only) illegal for &quot;open interchange&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Unicode database files not installed</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The Unicode database files are no longer installed with Perl. This doesn't
  affect any functionality in Perl and saves significant disk space. If you need
  these files, you can download them from
  &lt;http://www.unicode.org/Public/zipped/6.0.0/&gt;.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Regular_Expressions"><a class="selflink" href="#Regular_Expressions">Regular
  Expressions</a></h2>
<i></i><i>&quot;(?^...)&quot;</i><i> construct signifies default modifiers</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
An ASCII caret &quot;^&quot; immediately following a &quot;(?&quot; in a regular
  expression now means that the subexpression does not inherit surrounding
  modifiers such as &quot;/i&quot;, but reverts to the Perl defaults. Any
  modifiers following the caret override the defaults.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Stringification of regular expressions now uses this notation. For example,
  &quot;qr/hlagh/i&quot; would previously be stringified as
  &quot;(?i-xsm:hlagh)&quot;, but now it's stringified as
  &quot;(?^i:hlagh)&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The main purpose of this change is to allow tests that rely on the
  stringification <i>not</i> to have to change whenever new modifiers are added.
  See &quot;Extended Patterns&quot; in perlre.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This change is likely to break code that compares stringified regular
  expressions with fixed strings containing &quot;?-xism&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i></i><i>&quot;/d&quot;</i><i>, </i><i>&quot;/l&quot;</i><i>,
  </i><i>&quot;/u&quot;</i> <i>, and </i><i>&quot;/a&quot;</i><i> modifiers</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Four new regular expression modifiers have been added. These are mutually
  exclusive: one only can be turned on at a time.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The &quot;/l&quot; modifier says to compile the regular
      expression as if it were in the scope of &quot;use locale&quot;, even if
      it is not.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The &quot;/u&quot; modifier says to compile the regular
      expression as if it were in the scope of a &quot;use feature
      'unicode_strings'&quot; pragma.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The &quot;/d&quot; (default) modifier is used to override
      any &quot;use locale&quot; and &quot;use feature 'unicode_strings'&quot;

</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The &quot;/a&quot; regular expression modifier restricts
      &quot;\s&quot;, &quot;\d&quot; and &quot;\w&quot; and the POSIX
      (&quot;[[:posix:]]&quot;) character classes to the ASCII range. Their
      complements and &quot;\b&quot; and &quot;\B&quot; are correspondingly
      affected. Otherwise, &quot;/a&quot; behaves like the &quot;/u&quot;
      modifier, in that case-insensitive matching uses Unicode semantics.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If the &quot;/a&quot; modifier is repeated, then additionally in
      case-insensitive matching, no ASCII character can match a non-ASCII
      character. For example,
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    &quot;k&quot;     =~ /\N{KELVIN SIGN}/ai
    &quot;\xDF&quot; =~ /ss/ai
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    match but
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    &quot;k&quot;    =~ /\N{KELVIN SIGN}/aai
    &quot;\xDF&quot; =~ /ss/aai
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    do not match.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
See &quot;Modifiers&quot; in perlre for more detail.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Non-destructive substitution</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The substitution (&quot;s///&quot;) and transliteration (&quot;y///&quot;)
  operators now support an &quot;/r&quot; option that copies the input variable,
  carries out the substitution on the copy, and returns the result. The original
  remains unmodified.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  my $old = &quot;cat&quot;;
  my $new = $old =~ s/cat/dog/r;
  # $old is &quot;cat&quot; and $new is &quot;dog&quot;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This is particularly useful with &quot;map&quot;. See perlop for more examples.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Re-entrant regular expression engine</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
It is now safe to use regular expressions within &quot;(?{...})&quot; and
  &quot;(??{...})&quot; code blocks inside regular expressions.
<div class="Pp"></div>
These blocks are still experimental, however, and still have problems with
  lexical (&quot;my&quot;) variables and abnormal exiting.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i></i><i>&quot;use re '/flags'&quot;</i><i></i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The &quot;re&quot; pragma now has the ability to turn on regular expression
  flags till the end of the lexical scope:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    use re &quot;/x&quot;;
    &quot;foo&quot; =~ / (.+) /;  # /x implied
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
See &quot;'/flags' mode&quot; in re for details.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>\o{...} for octals</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
There is a new octal escape sequence, &quot;\o&quot;, in doublequote-like
  contexts. This construct allows large octal ordinals beyond the current max of
  0777 to be represented. It also allows you to specify a character in octal
  which can safely be concatenated with other regex snippets and which won't be
  confused with being a backreference to a regex capture group. See
  &quot;Capture groups&quot; in perlre.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Add </i><i>&quot;\p{Titlecase}&quot;</i><i> as a synonym for
  </i><i>&quot;\p{Title}&quot;</i> <i></i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This synonym is added for symmetry with the Unicode property names
  &quot;\p{Uppercase}&quot; and &quot;\p{Lowercase}&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Regular expression debugging output improvement</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Regular expression debugging output (turned on by &quot;use re 'debug'&quot;)
  now uses hexadecimal when escaping non-ASCII characters, instead of octal.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Return value of </i><i>&quot;delete $+{...}&quot;</i><i></i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Custom regular expression engines can now determine the return value of
  &quot;delete&quot; on an entry of &quot;%+&quot; or &quot;%-&quot;.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Syntactical_Enhancements"><a class="selflink" href="#Syntactical_Enhancements">Syntactical

<i>Array and hash container functions accept references</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Warning:</b> This feature is considered experimental, as the exact behaviour
  may change in a future version of Perl.
<div class="Pp"></div>
All builtin functions that operate directly on array or hash containers now also
  accept unblessed hard references to arrays or hashes:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  |----------------------------+---------------------------|
  | Traditional syntax         | Terse syntax              |
  |----------------------------+---------------------------|
  | push @$arrayref, @stuff    | push $arrayref, @stuff    |
  | unshift @$arrayref, @stuff | unshift $arrayref, @stuff |
  | pop @$arrayref             | pop $arrayref             |
  | shift @$arrayref           | shift $arrayref           |
  | splice @$arrayref, 0, 2    | splice $arrayref, 0, 2    |
  | keys %$hashref             | keys $hashref             |
  | keys @$arrayref            | keys $arrayref            |
  | values %$hashref           | values $hashref           |
  | values @$arrayref          | values $arrayref          |
  | ($k,$v) = each %$hashref   | ($k,$v) = each $hashref   |
  | ($k,$v) = each @$arrayref  | ($k,$v) = each $arrayref  |
  |----------------------------+---------------------------|
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This allows these builtin functions to act on long dereferencing chains or on
  the return value of subroutines without needing to wrap them in
  &quot;@{}&quot; or &quot;%{}&quot;:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  push @{$obj-&gt;tags}, $new_tag;  # old way
  push $obj-&gt;tags,    $new_tag;  # new way
  for ( keys %{$hoh-&gt;{genres}{artists}} ) {...} # old way 
  for ( keys $hoh-&gt;{genres}{artists}    ) {...} # new way
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Single term prototype</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The &quot;+&quot; prototype is a special alternative to &quot;$&quot; that acts
  like &quot;\[@%]&quot; when given a literal array or hash variable, but will
  otherwise force scalar context on the argument. See &quot;Prototypes&quot; in
  perlsub.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i></i><i>&quot;package&quot;</i><i> block syntax</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
A package declaration can now contain a code block, in which case the
  declaration is in scope inside that block only. So &quot;package Foo { ...
  }&quot; is precisely equivalent to &quot;{ package Foo; ... }&quot;. It also
  works with a version number in the declaration, as in &quot;package Foo 1.2 {
  ... }&quot;, which is its most attractive feature. See perlfunc.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Statement labels can appear in more places</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Statement labels can now occur before any type of statement or declaration, such
  as &quot;package&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Stacked labels</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Multiple statement labels can now appear before a single statement.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Uppercase X/B allowed in hexadecimal/binary literals</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Literals may now use either upper case &quot;0X...&quot; or &quot;0B...&quot;
  prefixes, in addition to the already supported &quot;0x...&quot; and
  &quot;0b...&quot; syntax [perl #76296].
<div class="Pp"></div>
C, Ruby, Python, and PHP already support this syntax, and it makes Perl more
  internally consistent: a round-trip with &quot;eval sprintf &quot;%#X&quot;,
  0x10&quot; now returns 16, just like &quot;eval sprintf &quot;%#x&quot;,
  0x10&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Overridable tie functions</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;tie&quot;, &quot;tied&quot; and &quot;untie&quot; can now be overridden
  [perl #75902].
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Exception_Handling"><a class="selflink" href="#Exception_Handling">Exception
  Handling</a></h2>
To make them more reliable and consistent, several changes have been made to how
  &quot;die&quot;, &quot;warn&quot;, and $@ behave.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">When an exception is thrown inside an &quot;eval&quot;, the
      exception is no longer at risk of being clobbered by destructor code
      running during unwinding. Previously, the exception was written into $@
      early in the throwing process, and would be overwritten if
      &quot;eval&quot; was used internally in the destructor for an object that
      had to be freed while exiting from the outer &quot;eval&quot;. Now the
      exception is written into $@ last thing before exiting the outer
      &quot;eval&quot;, so the code running immediately thereafter can rely on
      the value in $@ correctly corresponding to that &quot;eval&quot;. ($@ is
      still also set before exiting the &quot;eval&quot;, for the sake of
      destructors that rely on this.)
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Likewise, a &quot;local $@&quot; inside an &quot;eval&quot; no longer
      clobbers any exception thrown in its scope. Previously, the restoration of
      $@ upon unwinding would overwrite any exception being thrown. Now the
      exception gets to the &quot;eval&quot; anyway. So &quot;local $@&quot; is
      safe before a &quot;die&quot;.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Exceptions thrown from object destructors no longer modify the $@ of the
      surrounding context. (If the surrounding context was exception unwinding,
      this used to be another way to clobber the exception being thrown.)
      Previously such an exception was sometimes emitted as a warning, and then
      either was string-appended to the surrounding $@ or completely replaced
      the surrounding $@, depending on whether that exception and the
      surrounding $@ were strings or objects. Now, an exception in this
      situation is always emitted as a warning, leaving the surrounding $@
      untouched. In addition to object destructors, this also affects any
      function call run by XS code using the &quot;G_KEEPERR&quot; flag.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Warnings for &quot;warn&quot; can now be objects in the
      same way as exceptions for &quot;die&quot;. If an object-based warning
      gets the default handling of writing to standard error, it is stringified
      as before with the filename and line number appended. But a $SIG{__WARN__}
      handler now receives an object-based warning as an object, where
      previously it was passed the result of stringifying the object.</dd>
</dl>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Other_Enhancements"><a class="selflink" href="#Other_Enhancements">Other
  Enhancements</a></h2>
<i>Assignment to </i><i>$0</i><i> sets the legacy process name with
  </i><i>prctl()</i> <i> on Linux</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
On Linux the legacy process name is now set with <i>prctl</i>(2), in addition to
  altering the POSIX name via &quot;argv[0]&quot;, as Perl has done since
  version 4.000. Now system utilities that read the legacy process name such as
  <i>ps</i>, <i>top</i>, and <i>killall</i> recognize the name you set when
  assigning to $0. The string you supply is truncated at 16 bytes; this
  limitation is imposed by Linux.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i></i><i>srand()</i><i> now returns the seed</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This allows programs that need to have repeatable results not to have to come up
  with their own seed-generating mechanism. Instead, they can use <i>srand()</i>
  and stash the return value for future use. One example is a test program with
  too many combinations to test comprehensively in the time available for each
  run. It can test a random subset each time and, should there be a failure, log
  the seed used for that run so this can later be used to produce the same
  results.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>printf-like functions understand post-1980 size modifiers</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Perl's printf and sprintf operators, and Perl's internal printf replacement
  function, now understand the C90 size modifiers &quot;hh&quot;
  (&quot;char&quot;), &quot;z&quot; (&quot;size_t&quot;), and &quot;t&quot;
  (&quot;ptrdiff_t&quot;). Also, when compiled with a C99 compiler, Perl now
  understands the size modifier &quot;j&quot; (&quot;intmax_t&quot;) (but this
  is not portable).
<div class="Pp"></div>
So, for example, on any modern machine, &quot;sprintf(&quot;%hhd&quot;,
  257)&quot; returns &quot;1&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>New global variable </i><i>&quot;${^GLOBAL_PHASE}&quot;</i><i></i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
A new global variable, &quot;${^GLOBAL_PHASE}&quot;, has been added to allow
  introspection of the current phase of the Perl interpreter. It's explained in
  detail in &quot;${^GLOBAL_PHASE}&quot; in perlvar and in &quot;BEGIN,
  UNITCHECK, CHECK, INIT and END&quot; in perlmod.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i></i><i>&quot;-d:-foo&quot;</i><i> calls
  </i><i>&quot;Devel::foo::unimport&quot;</i> <i></i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The syntax <b>-d:foo</b> was extended in 5.6.1 to make <b>-d:foo=bar</b>
  equivalent to <b>-MDevel::foo=bar</b>, which expands internally to &quot;use
  Devel::foo 'bar'&quot;. Perl now allows prefixing the module name with
  <b>-</b>, with the same semantics as <b>-M</b>; that is:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&quot;-d:-foo&quot;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Equivalent to <b>-M-Devel::foo</b>: expands to &quot;no
      Devel::foo&quot; and calls &quot;Devel::foo-&gt;unimport()&quot; if that
      method exists.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&quot;-d:-foo=bar&quot;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Equivalent to <b>-M-Devel::foo=bar</b>: expands to &quot;no
      Devel::foo 'bar'&quot;, and calls
      &quot;Devel::foo-&gt;unimport(&quot;bar&quot;)&quot; if that method
      exists.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This is particularly useful for suppressing the default actions of a
  &quot;Devel::*&quot; module's &quot;import&quot; method whilst still loading
  it for debugging.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Filehandle method calls load IO::File on demand</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
When a method call on a filehandle would die because the method cannot be
  resolved and IO::File has not been loaded, Perl now loads IO::File via
  &quot;require&quot; and attempts method resolution again:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  open my $fh, &quot;&gt;&quot;, $file;
  $fh-&gt;binmode(&quot;:raw&quot;);     # loads IO::File and succeeds
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This also works for globs like &quot;STDOUT&quot;, &quot;STDERR&quot;, and
  &quot;STDIN&quot;:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  STDOUT-&gt;autoflush(1);
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Because this on-demand load happens only if method resolution fails, the legacy
  approach of manually loading an IO::File parent class for partial method
  support still works as expected:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  use IO::Handle;
  open my $fh, &quot;&gt;&quot;, $file;
  $fh-&gt;autoflush(1);        # IO::File not loaded
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Improved IPv6 support</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The &quot;Socket&quot; module provides new affordances for IPv6, including
  implementations of the &quot;Socket::getaddrinfo()&quot; and
  &quot;Socket::getnameinfo()&quot; functions, along with related constants and
  a handful of new functions. See Socket.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>DTrace probes now include package name</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The &quot;DTrace&quot; probes now include an additional argument,
  &quot;arg3&quot;, which contains the package the subroutine being entered or
  left was compiled in.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For example, using the following DTrace script:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  perl$target:::sub-entry
  {
      printf(&quot;%s::%s\n&quot;, copyinstr(arg0), copyinstr(arg3));
  }
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
and then running:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  $ perl -e 'sub test { }; test'
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;DTrace&quot; will print:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  main::test
</pre>

  if it existed. The documented convention is now enforced.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Also, Perl no longer allows tainted regular expressions to invoke a user-defined

<i>Inverted bracketed character classes and multi-character folds</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Some characters match a sequence of two or three characters in &quot;/i&quot;
  regular expression matching under Unicode rules. One example is &quot;LATIN
  SMALL LETTER SHARP S&quot; which matches the sequence &quot;ss&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 'ss' =~ /\A[\N{LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S}]\z/i  # Matches
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This, however, can lead to very counter-intuitive results, especially when
  inverted. Because of this, Perl 5.14 does not use multi-character
  &quot;/i&quot; matching in inverted character classes.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 'ss' =~ /\A[^\N{LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S}]+\z/i  # ???
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This should match any sequences of characters that aren't the &quot;SHARP
  S&quot; nor what &quot;SHARP S&quot; matches under &quot;/i&quot;.
  &quot;s&quot; isn't &quot;SHARP S&quot;, but Unicode says that &quot;ss&quot;
  is what &quot;SHARP S&quot; matches under &quot;/i&quot;. So which one
  &quot;wins&quot;? Do you fail the match because the string has &quot;ss&quot;
  or accept it because it has an &quot;s&quot; followed by another
  &quot;s&quot;?
<div class="Pp"></div>
Earlier releases of Perl did allow this multi-character matching, but due to
  bugs, it mostly did not work.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>\400-\777</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
In certain circumstances, &quot;\400&quot;-&quot;\777&quot; in regexes have
  behaved differently than they behave in all other doublequote-like contexts.
  Since 5.10.1, Perl has issued a deprecation warning when this happens. Now,
  these literals behave the same in all doublequote-like contexts, namely to be
  equivalent to &quot;\x{100}&quot;-&quot;\x{1FF}&quot;, with no deprecation
  warning.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Use of &quot;\400&quot;-&quot;\777&quot; in the command-line option <b>-0</b>
  retain their conventional meaning. They slurp whole input files; previously,
  this was documented only for <b>-0777</b>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Because of various ambiguities, you should use the new &quot;\o{...}&quot;
  construct to represent characters in octal instead.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Most </i><i>&quot;\p{}&quot;</i><i> properties are now immune to
  case-insensitive matching</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
For most Unicode properties, it doesn't make sense to have them match
  differently under &quot;/i&quot; case-insensitive matching. Doing so can lead
  to unexpected results and potential security holes. For example
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 m/\p{ASCII_Hex_Digit}+/i
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
could previously match non-ASCII characters because of the Unicode matching
  rules (although there were several bugs with this). Now matching under
  &quot;/i&quot; gives the same results as non-&quot;/i&quot; matching except
  for those few properties where people have come to expect differences, namely
  the ones where casing is an integral part of their meaning, such as
  &quot;m/\p{Uppercase}/i&quot; and &quot;m/\p{Lowercase}/i&quot;, both of which
  match the same code points as matched by &quot;m/\p{Cased}/i&quot;. Details
  are in &quot;Unicode Properties&quot; in perlrecharclass.
<div class="Pp"></div>
User-defined property handlers that need to match differently under
  &quot;/i&quot; must be changed to read the new boolean parameter passed to
  them, which is non-zero if case-insensitive matching is in effect and 0
  otherwise. See &quot;User-Defined Character Properties&quot; in perlunicode.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>\p{} implies Unicode semantics</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Specifying a Unicode property in the pattern indicates that the pattern is meant
  for matching according to Unicode rules, the way &quot;\N{ <i>NAME</i>}&quot;
  does.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Regular expressions retain their localeness when interpolated</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Regular expressions compiled under &quot;use locale&quot; now retain this when
  interpolated into a new regular expression compiled outside a &quot;use
  locale&quot;, and vice-versa.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Previously, one regular expression interpolated into another inherited the
  localeness of the surrounding regex, losing whatever state it originally had.
  This is considered a bug fix, but may trip up code that has come to rely on
  the incorrect behaviour.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Stringification of regexes has changed</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Default regular expression modifiers are now notated using &quot;(?^...)&quot;.
  Code relying on the old stringification will fail. This is so that when new
  modifiers are added, such code won't have to keep changing each time this
  happens, because the stringification will automatically incorporate the new
  modifiers.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Code that needs to work properly with both old- and new-style regexes can avoid
  the whole issue by using (for perls since 5.9.5; see re):
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 use re qw(regexp_pattern);
 my ($pat, $mods) = regexp_pattern($re_ref);
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the actual stringification is important or older Perls need to be supported,
  you can use something like the following:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    # Accept both old and new-style stringification
    my $modifiers = (qr/foobar/ =~ /\Q(?^/) ? &quot;^&quot; : &quot;-xism&quot;;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
And then use $modifiers instead of &quot;-xism&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Run-time code blocks in regular expressions inherit pragmata</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Code blocks in regular expressions (&quot;(?{...})&quot; and
  &quot;(??{...})&quot;) previously did not inherit pragmata (strict, warnings,
  etc.) if the regular expression was compiled at run time as happens in cases
  like these two:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  use re &quot;eval&quot;;
  $foo =~ $bar; # when $bar contains (?{...})
  $foo =~ /$bar(?{ $finished = 1 })/;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This bug has now been fixed, but code that relied on the buggy behaviour may
  need to be fixed to account for the correct behaviour.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Stashes_and_Package_Variables"><a class="selflink" href="#Stashes_and_Package_Variables">Stashes
  and Package Variables</a></h2>
<i>Localised tied hashes and arrays are no longed tied</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
In the following:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    tie @a, ...;
    {
            local @a;
            # here, @a is a now a new, untied array
    }
    # here, @a refers again to the old, tied array
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Earlier versions of Perl incorrectly tied the new local array. This has now been
  fixed. This fix could however potentially cause a change in behaviour of some
  code.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Stashes are now always defined</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;defined %Foo::&quot; now always returns true, even when no symbols have
  yet been defined in that package.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This is a side-effect of removing a special-case kludge in the tokeniser, added
  for 5.10.0, to hide side-effects of changes to the internal storage of hashes.
  The fix drastically reduces hashes' memory overhead.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Calling defined on a stash has been deprecated since 5.6.0, warned on lexicals
  since 5.6.0, and warned for stashes and other package variables since 5.12.0.
  &quot;defined %hash&quot; has always exposed an implementation detail:
  emptying a hash by deleting all entries from it does not make &quot;defined
  %hash&quot; false. Hence &quot;defined %hash&quot; is not valid code to
  determine whether an arbitrary hash is empty. Instead, use the behaviour of an
  empty %hash always returning false in scalar context.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Clearing stashes</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Stash list assignment &quot;%foo:: = ()&quot; used to make the stash temporarily
  anonymous while it was being emptied. Consequently, any of its subroutines
  referenced elsewhere would become anonymous, showing up as
  &quot;(unknown)&quot; in &quot;caller&quot;. They now retain their package
  names such that &quot;caller&quot; returns the original sub name if there is
  still a reference to its typeglob and &quot;foo::__ANON__&quot; otherwise
  [perl #79208].
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Dereferencing typeglobs</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you assign a typeglob to a scalar variable:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    $glob = *foo;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
the glob that is copied to $glob is marked with a special flag indicating that
  the glob is just a copy. This allows subsequent assignments to $glob to
  overwrite the glob. The original glob, however, is immutable.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Some Perl operators did not distinguish between these two types of globs. This
  would result in strange behaviour in edge cases: &quot;untie $scalar&quot;
  would not untie the scalar if the last thing assigned to it was a glob
  (because it treated it as &quot;untie *$scalar&quot;, which unties a handle).
  Assignment to a glob slot (such as &quot;*$glob = \@some_array&quot;) would
  simply assign &quot;\@some_array&quot; to $glob.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To fix this, the &quot;*{}&quot; operator (including its *foo and *$foo forms)
  has been modified to make a new immutable glob if its operand is a glob copy.
  This allows operators that make a distinction between globs and scalars to be
  modified to treat only immutable globs as globs. (&quot;tie&quot;,
  &quot;tied&quot; and &quot;untie&quot; have been left as they are for
  compatibility's sake, but will warn. See &quot;Deprecations&quot;.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
This causes an incompatible change in code that assigns a glob to the return
  value of &quot;*{}&quot; when that operator was passed a glob copy. Take the
  following code, for instance:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    $glob = *foo;
    *$glob = *bar;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The *$glob on the second line returns a new immutable glob. That new glob is
  made an alias to *bar. Then it is discarded. So the second assignment has no
  effect.
<div class="Pp"></div>
See &lt;http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=77810&gt; for more
  detail.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Magic variables outside the main package</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
In previous versions of Perl, magic variables like $!, %SIG, etc. would
  &quot;leak&quot; into other packages. So %foo::SIG could be used to access
  signals, &quot;${&quot;foo::!&quot;}&quot; (with strict mode off) to access
  C's &quot;errno&quot;, etc.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This was a bug, or an &quot;unintentional&quot; feature, which caused various
  ill effects, such as signal handlers being wiped when modules were loaded,
  etc.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This has been fixed (or the feature has been removed, depending on how you see
  it).
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>local($_) strips all magic from </i><i>$_</i><i></i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>local()</i> on scalar variables gives them a new value but keeps all their
  magic intact. This has proven problematic for the default scalar variable $_,
  where perlsub recommends that any subroutine that assigns to $_ should first
  localize it. This would throw an exception if $_ is aliased to a read-only
  variable, and could in general have various unintentional side-effects.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Therefore, as an exception to the general rule, local($_) will not only assign a
  new value to $_, but also remove all existing magic from it as well.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Parsing of package and variable names</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Parsing the names of packages and package variables has changed: multiple
  adjacent pairs of colons, as in &quot;foo::::bar&quot;, are now all treated as
  package separators.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Regardless of this change, the exact parsing of package separators has never
  been guaranteed and is subject to change in future Perl versions.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Changes_to_Syntax_or_to_Perl_Operators"><a class="selflink" href="#Changes_to_Syntax_or_to_Perl_Operators">Changes
  to Syntax or to Perl Operators</a></h2>
<i></i><i>&quot;given&quot;</i><i> return values</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;given&quot; blocks now return the last evaluated expression, or an empty
  list if the block was exited by &quot;break&quot;. Thus you can now write:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    my $type = do {
     given ($num) {
      break     when undef;
      &quot;integer&quot; when /^[+-]?[0-9]+$/;
      &quot;float&quot;   when /^[+-]?[0-9]+(?:\.[0-9]+)?$/;
      &quot;unknown&quot;;
     }
    };
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
See &quot;Return value&quot; in perlsyn for details.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Change in parsing of certain prototypes</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Functions declared with the following prototypes now behave correctly as unary
  functions:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  *
  \$ \% \@ \* \&amp;
  \[...]
  ;$ ;*
  ;\$ ;\% etc.
  ;\[...]
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Due to this bug fix [perl #75904], functions using the &quot;(*)&quot;,
  &quot;(;$)&quot; and &quot;(;*)&quot; prototypes are parsed with higher
  precedence than before. So in the following example:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  sub foo(;$);
  foo $a &lt; $b;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
the second line is now parsed correctly as &quot;foo($a) &lt; $b&quot;, rather
  than &quot;foo($a &lt; $b)&quot;. This happens when one of these operators is
  used in an unparenthesised argument:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  &lt; &gt; &lt;= &gt;= lt gt le ge
  == != &lt;=&gt; eq ne cmp ~~
  &amp;
  | ^
  &amp;&amp;
  || //
  .. ...
  ?:
  = += -= *= etc.
  , =&gt;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Smart-matching against array slices</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Previously, the following code resulted in a successful match:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    my @a = qw(a y0 z);
    my @b = qw(a x0 z);
    @a[0 .. $#b] ~~ @b;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This odd behaviour has now been fixed [perl #77468].
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Negation treats strings differently from before</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The unary negation operator, &quot;-&quot;, now treats strings that look like
  numbers as numbers [perl #57706].
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Negative zero</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Negative zero (-0.0), when converted to a string, now becomes &quot;0&quot; on
  all platforms. It used to become &quot;-0&quot; on some, but &quot;0&quot; on
  others.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you still need to determine whether a zero is negative, use
  &quot;sprintf(&quot;%g&quot;, $zero) =~ /^-/&quot; or the Data::Float module
  on CPAN.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i></i><i>&quot;:=&quot;</i><i> is now a syntax error</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Previously &quot;my $pi := 4&quot; was exactly equivalent to &quot;my $pi : =
  4&quot;, with the &quot;:&quot; being treated as the start of an attribute
  list, ending before the &quot;=&quot;. The use of &quot;:=&quot; to mean
  &quot;: =&quot; was deprecated in 5.12.0, and is now a syntax error. This
  allows future use of &quot;:=&quot; as a new token.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Outside the core's tests for it, we find no Perl 5 code on CPAN using this
  construction, so we believe that this change will have little impact on
  real-world codebases.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If it is absolutely necessary to have empty attribute lists (for example,
  because of a code generator), simply avoid the error by adding a space before
  the &quot;=&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Change in the parsing of identifiers</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Characters outside the Unicode &quot;XIDStart&quot; set are no longer allowed at
  the beginning of an identifier. This means that certain accents and marks that
  normally follow an alphabetic character may no longer be the first character
  of an identifier.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Threads_and_Processes"><a class="selflink" href="#Threads_and_Processes">Threads
  and Processes</a></h2>
<i>Directory handles not copied to threads</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
On systems other than Windows that do not have a &quot;fchdir&quot; function,
  newly-created threads no longer inherit directory handles from their parent
  threads. Such programs would usually have crashed anyway [perl #75154].
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i></i><i>&quot;close&quot;</i><i> on shared pipes</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
To avoid deadlocks, the &quot;close&quot; function no longer waits for the child
  process to exit if the underlying file descriptor is still in use by another
  thread. It returns true in such cases.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i></i><i>fork()</i><i> emulation will not wait for signalled children</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
On Windows parent processes would not terminate until all forked children had
  terminated first. However, &quot;kill(&quot;KILL&quot;, ...)&quot; is
  inherently unstable on pseudo-processes, and &quot;kill(&quot;TERM&quot;,
  ...)&quot; might not get delivered if the child is blocked in a system call.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To avoid the deadlock and still provide a safe mechanism to terminate the
  hosting process, Perl now no longer waits for children that have been sent a
  SIGTERM signal. It is up to the parent process to <i>waitpid()</i> for these
  children if child-cleanup processing must be allowed to finish. However, it is
  also then the responsibility of the parent to avoid the deadlock by making
  sure the child process can't be blocked on I/O.
<div class="Pp"></div>
See perlfork for more information about the <i>fork()</i> emulation on Windows.

<i>Naming fixes in Policy_sh.SH may invalidate Policy.sh</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Several long-standing typos and naming confusions in <i>Policy_sh.SH</i> have
  been fixed, standardizing on the variable names used in <i>config.sh</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This will change the behaviour of <i>Policy.sh</i> if you happen to have been
  accidentally relying on its incorrect behaviour.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Perl source code is read in text mode on Windows</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Perl scripts used to be read in binary mode on Windows for the benefit of the
  ByteLoader module (which is no longer part of core Perl). This had the
  side-effect of breaking various operations on the &quot;DATA&quot; filehandle,
  including <i>seek()</i>/<i>tell()</i>, and even simply reading from
  &quot;DATA&quot; after filehandles have been flushed by a call to
  <i>system()</i>, backticks, <i>fork()</i> etc.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The default build options for Windows have been changed to read Perl source code
  on Windows in text mode now. ByteLoader will (hopefully) be updated on CPAN to
  automatically handle this situation [perl #28106].

Omitting the space between a regular expression operator or its modifiers and

In regular expressions, a literal &quot;{&quot; immediately following a

  now deprecated to allow for its future use by Perl itself.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Perl_4-era_.pl_libraries"><a class="selflink" href="#Perl_4-era_.pl_libraries">Perl

  assignment to $[</a></h2>
Assignment to $[ was deprecated and started to give warnings in Perl version
  5.12.0. This version of Perl (5.14) now also emits a warning when assigning to
  $[ in list context. This fixes an oversight in 5.12.0.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Use_of_qw(...)_as_parentheses"><a class="selflink" href="#Use_of_qw(...)_as_parentheses">Use
  of qw(...) as parentheses</a></h2>
Historically the parser fooled itself into thinking that &quot;qw(...)&quot;
  literals were always enclosed in parentheses, and as a result you could
  sometimes omit parentheses around them:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    for $x qw(a b c) { ... }
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The parser no longer lies to itself in this way. Wrap the list literal in
  parentheses like this:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    for $x (qw(a b c)) { ... }
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This is being deprecated because the parentheses in &quot;for $i (1,2,3) { ...
  }&quot; are not part of expression syntax. They are part of the statement
  syntax, with the &quot;for&quot; statement wanting literal parentheses. The
  synthetic parentheses that a &quot;qw&quot; expression acquired were only
  intended to be treated as part of expression syntax.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that this does not change the behaviour of cases like:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    use POSIX qw(setlocale localeconv);
    our @EXPORT = qw(foo bar baz);
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
where parentheses were never required around the expression.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="&quot;\N{BELL}&quot;"><a class="selflink" href="#&quot;\N{BELL}&quot;">&quot;\N{BELL}&quot;</a></h2>
This is because Unicode is using that name for a different character. See
  &quot;Unicode Version 6.0 is now supported (mostly)&quot; for more
  explanation.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="&quot;?PATTERN?&quot;"><a class="selflink" href="#&quot;?PATTERN?&quot;">&quot;?PATTERN?&quot;</a></h2>
&quot;?PATTERN?&quot; (without the initial &quot;m&quot;) has been deprecated
  and now produces a warning. This is to allow future use of &quot;?&quot; in
  new operators. The match-once functionality is still available as
  &quot;m?PATTERN?&quot;.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Tie_functions_on_scalars_holding_typeglobs"><a class="selflink" href="#Tie_functions_on_scalars_holding_typeglobs">Tie
  functions on scalars holding typeglobs</a></h2>
Calling a tie function (&quot;tie&quot;, &quot;tied&quot;, &quot;untie&quot;)
  with a scalar argument acts on a filehandle if the scalar happens to hold a
  typeglob.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This is a long-standing bug that will be removed in Perl 5.16, as there is
  currently no way to tie the scalar itself when it holds a typeglob, and no way
  to untie a scalar that has had a typeglob assigned to it.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Now there is a deprecation warning whenever a tie function is used on a handle
  without an explicit &quot;*&quot;.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="User-defined_case-mapping"><a class="selflink" href="#User-defined_case-mapping">User-defined
  case-mapping</a></h2>
This feature is being deprecated due to its many issues, as documented in
  &quot;User-Defined Case Mappings (for serious hackers only)&quot; in
  perlunicode. This feature will be removed in Perl 5.16. Instead use the CPAN
  module Unicode::Casing, which provides improved functionality.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Deprecated_modules"><a class="selflink" href="#Deprecated_modules">Deprecated
  modules</a></h2>
The following module will be removed from the core distribution in a future
  release, and should be installed from CPAN instead. Distributions on CPAN that
  require this should add it to their prerequisites. The core version of these
  module now issues a deprecation warning.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you ship a packaged version of Perl, either alone or as part of a larger
  system, then you should carefully consider the repercussions of core module
  deprecations. You may want to consider shipping your default build of Perl
  with a package for the deprecated module that installs into &quot;vendor&quot;
  or &quot;site&quot; Perl library directories. This will inhibit the
  deprecation warnings.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Alternatively, you may want to consider patching <i>lib/deprecate.pm</i> to
  provide deprecation warnings specific to your packaging system or distribution
  of Perl, consistent with how your packaging system or distribution manages a
  staged transition from a release where the installation of a single package
  provides the given functionality, to a later release where the system
  administrator needs to know to install multiple packages to get that same
  functionality.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can silence these deprecation warnings by installing the module in question
  from CPAN. To install the latest version of it by role rather than by name,
  just install &quot;Task::Deprecations::5_14&quot;.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">Devel::DProf</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">We strongly recommend that you install and use

<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="&quot;Safe_signals&quot;_optimisation"><a class="selflink" href="#&quot;Safe_signals&quot;_optimisation">&quot;Safe
  signals&quot; optimisation</a></h2>
Signal dispatch has been moved from the runloop into control ops. This should
  give a few percent speed increase, and eliminates nearly all the speed penalty
  caused by the introduction of &quot;safe signals&quot; in 5.8.0. Signals
  should still be dispatched within the same statement as they were previously.
  If this does <i>not</i> happen, or if you find it possible to create
  uninterruptible loops, this is a bug, and reports are encouraged of how to
  recreate such issues.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Optimisation_of_shift()_and_pop()_calls_without_arguments"><a class="selflink" href="#Optimisation_of_shift()_and_pop()_calls_without_arguments">Optimisation
  of <i>shift()</i> and <i>pop()</i> calls without arguments</a></h2>
Two fewer OPs are used for <i>shift()</i> and <i>pop()</i> calls with no
  argument (with implicit @_). This change makes <i>shift()</i> 5% faster than
  &quot;shift @_&quot; on non-threaded perls, and 25% faster on threaded ones.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Optimisation_of_regexp_engine_string_comparison_work"><a class="selflink" href="#Optimisation_of_regexp_engine_string_comparison_work">Optimisation
  of regexp engine string comparison work</a></h2>
The &quot;foldEQ_utf8&quot; API function for case-insensitive comparison of
  strings (which is used heavily by the regexp engine) was substantially
  refactored and optimised -- and its documentation much improved as a free
  bonus.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Regular_expression_compilation_speed-up"><a class="selflink" href="#Regular_expression_compilation_speed-up">Regular
  expression compilation speed-up</a></h2>
Compiling regular expressions has been made faster when upgrading the regex to
  utf8 is necessary but this isn't known when the compilation begins.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="String_appending_is_100_times_faster"><a class="selflink" href="#String_appending_is_100_times_faster">String
  appending is 100 times faster</a></h2>
When doing a lot of string appending, perls built to use the system's
  &quot;malloc&quot; could end up allocating a lot more memory than needed in a
  inefficient way.
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;sv_grow&quot;, the function used to allocate more memory if necessary when
  appending to a string, has been taught to round up the memory it requests to a
  certain geometric progression, making it much faster on certain platforms and
  configurations. On Win32, it's now about 100 times faster.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Eliminate_&quot;PL_*&quot;_accessor_functions_under_ithreads"><a class="selflink" href="#Eliminate_&quot;PL_*&quot;_accessor_functions_under_ithreads">Eliminate
  &quot;PL_*&quot; accessor functions under ithreads</a></h2>
When &quot;MULTIPLICITY&quot; was first developed, and interpreter state moved
  into an interpreter struct, thread- and interpreter-local &quot;PL_*&quot;
  variables were defined as macros that called accessor functions (returning the
  address of the value) outside the Perl core. The intent was to allow members
  within the interpreter struct to change size without breaking binary
  compatibility, so that bug fixes could be merged to a maintenance branch that
  necessitated such a size change. This mechanism was redundant and penalised
  well-behaved code. It has been removed.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Freeing_weak_references"><a class="selflink" href="#Freeing_weak_references">Freeing
  weak references</a></h2>
When there are many weak references to an object, freeing that object can under
  some circumstances take O( <i>N*N</i>) time to free, where <i>N</i> is the
  number of references. The circumstances in which this can happen have been
  reduced [perl #75254]
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Lexical_array_and_hash_assignments"><a class="selflink" href="#Lexical_array_and_hash_assignments">Lexical
  array and hash assignments</a></h2>
An earlier optimisation to speed up &quot;my @array = ...&quot; and &quot;my
  %hash = ...&quot; assignments caused a bug and was disabled in Perl 5.12.0.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Now we have found another way to speed up these assignments [perl #82110].
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="@__uses_less_memory"><a class="selflink" href="#@__uses_less_memory">@_
  uses less memory</a></h2>
Previously, @_ was allocated for every subroutine at compile time with enough
  space for four entries. Now this allocation is done on demand when the
  subroutine is called [perl #72416].
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Size_optimisations_to_SV_and_HV_structures"><a class="selflink" href="#Size_optimisations_to_SV_and_HV_structures">Size
  optimisations to SV and HV structures</a></h2>
&quot;xhv_fill&quot; has been eliminated from &quot;struct xpvhv&quot;, saving 1
  IV per hash and on some systems will cause &quot;struct xpvhv&quot; to become
  cache-aligned. To avoid this memory saving causing a slowdown elsewhere,
  boolean use of &quot;HvFILL&quot; now calls &quot;HvTOTALKEYS&quot; instead
  (which is equivalent), so while the fill data when actually required are now
  calculated on demand, cases when this needs to be done should be rare.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The order of structure elements in SV bodies has changed. Effectively, the NV
  slot has swapped location with STASH and MAGIC. As all access to SV members is
  via macros, this should be completely transparent. This change allows the
  space saving for PVHVs documented above, and may reduce the memory allocation
  needed for PVIVs on some architectures.
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;XPV&quot;, &quot;XPVIV&quot;, and &quot;XPVNV&quot; now allocate only the
  parts of the &quot;SV&quot; body they actually use, saving some space.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Scalars containing regular expressions now allocate only the part of the
  &quot;SV&quot; body they actually use, saving some space.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Memory_consumption_improvements_to_Exporter"><a class="selflink" href="#Memory_consumption_improvements_to_Exporter">Memory
  consumption improvements to Exporter</a></h2>
The @EXPORT_FAIL AV is no longer created unless needed, hence neither is the
  typeglob backing it. This saves about 200 bytes for every package that uses
  Exporter but doesn't use this functionality.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Memory_savings_for_weak_references"><a class="selflink" href="#Memory_savings_for_weak_references">Memory
  savings for weak references</a></h2>
For weak references, the common case of just a single weak reference per
  referent has been optimised to reduce the storage required. In this case it
  saves the equivalent of one small Perl array per referent.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="&quot;%+&quot;_and_&quot;%-&quot;_use_less_memory"><a class="selflink" href="#&quot;%+&quot;_and_&quot;%-&quot;_use_less_memory">&quot;%+&quot;
  and &quot;%-&quot; use less memory</a></h2>
The bulk of the &quot;Tie::Hash::NamedCapture&quot; module used to be in the
  Perl core. It has now been moved to an XS module to reduce overhead for
  programs that do not use &quot;%+&quot; or &quot;%-&quot;.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Multiple_small_improvements_to_threads"><a class="selflink" href="#Multiple_small_improvements_to_threads">Multiple
  small improvements to threads</a></h2>
The internal structures of threading now make fewer API calls and fewer
  allocations, resulting in noticeably smaller object code. Additionally, many
  thread context checks have been deferred so they're done only as needed
  (although this is only possible for non-debugging builds).
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Adjacent_pairs_of_nextstate_opcodes_are_now_optimized_away"><a class="selflink" href="#Adjacent_pairs_of_nextstate_opcodes_are_now_optimized_away">Adjacent
  pairs of nextstate opcodes are now optimized away</a></h2>
Previously, in code such as
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    use constant DEBUG =&gt; 0;
    sub GAK {
        warn if DEBUG;
        print &quot;stuff\n&quot;;
    }
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
the ops for &quot;warn if DEBUG&quot; would be folded to a &quot;null&quot; op
  (&quot;ex-const&quot;), but the &quot;nextstate&quot; op would remain,
  resulting in a runtime op dispatch of &quot;nextstate&quot;,
  &quot;nextstate&quot;, etc.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The execution of a sequence of &quot;nextstate&quot; ops is indistinguishable
  from just the last &quot;nextstate&quot; op so the peephole optimizer now
  eliminates the first of a pair of &quot;nextstate&quot; ops except when the
  first carries a label, since labels must not be eliminated by the optimizer,
  and label usage isn't conclusively known at compile time.

  <dd class="It-tag">Carp has been upgraded from version 1.15 to 1.20.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Carp now detects incomplete <i>caller()</i> overrides and avoids using bogus
      @DB::args. To provide backtraces, Carp relies on particular behaviour of
      the <i>caller()</i> builtin. Carp now detects if other code has overridden
      this with an incomplete implementation, and modifies its backtrace
      accordingly. Previously incomplete overrides would cause incorrect values
      in backtraces (best case), or obscure fatal errors (worst case).
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This fixes certain cases of &quot;Bizarre copy of ARRAY&quot; caused by
      modules overriding <i>caller()</i> incorrectly (5.12.2).
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    It now also avoids using regular expressions that cause Perl to load its
      Unicode tables, so as to avoid the &quot;BEGIN not safe after errors&quot;
      error that ensue if there has been a syntax error [perl #82854].</dd>

<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="New_Documentation"><a class="selflink" href="#New_Documentation">New

<i>perlgpl</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
perlgpl has been updated to contain GPL version 1, as is included in the
  <i>README</i> distributed with Perl (5.12.1).
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Perl 5.12.x delta files</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The perldelta files for Perl 5.12.1 to 5.12.3 have been added from the
  maintenance branch: perl5121delta, perl5122delta, perl5123delta.
<div class="Pp"></div>

<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Changes_to_Existing_Documentation"><a class="selflink" href="#Changes_to_Existing_Documentation">Changes
  to Existing Documentation</a></h2>
<i>perlmodlib is now complete</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The perlmodlib manpage that came with Perl 5.12.0 was missing several modules
  due to a bug in the script that generates the list. This has been fixed [perl
  #74332] (5.12.1).
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Replace incorrect tr/// table in perlebcdic</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
perlebcdic contains a helpful table to use in &quot;tr///&quot; to convert
  between EBCDIC and Latin1/ASCII. The table was the inverse of the one it
  describes, though the code that used the table worked correctly for the
  specific example given.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The table has been corrected and the sample code changed to correspond.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The table has also been changed to hex from octal, and the recipes in the pod
  have been altered to print out leading zeros to make all values the same
  length.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Tricks for user-defined casing</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
perlunicode now contains an explanation of how to override, mangle and otherwise
  tweak the way Perl handles upper-, lower- and other-case conversions on
  Unicode data, and how to provide scoped changes to alter one's own code's
  behaviour without stomping on anybody else's.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>INSTALL explicitly states that Perl requires a C89 compiler</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This was already true, but it's now Officially Stated For The Record (5.12.2).
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Explanation of </i><i>&quot;\x</i><i>HH</i><i>&quot;</i><i> and
  </i><i>&quot;\o</i> <i>OOO</i><i>&quot;</i><i> escapes</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
perlop has been updated with more detailed explanation of these two character
  escapes.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i></i><b><i>-0</i></b><b><i>NNN</i></b><b><i></i></b><i> switch</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
In perlrun, the behaviour of the <b>-0NNN</b> switch for <b>-0400</b> or higher
  has been clarified (5.12.2).
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Maintenance policy</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
perlpolicy now contains the policy on what patches are acceptable for
  maintenance branches (5.12.1).
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Deprecation policy</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
perlpolicy now contains the policy on compatibility and deprecation along with
  definitions of terms like &quot;deprecation&quot; (5.12.2).
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>New descriptions in perldiag</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>

<div class="Pp"></div>
perlbook has been expanded to cover many more popular books.

<i></i><i>&quot;SvTRUE&quot;</i><i> macro</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The documentation for the &quot;SvTRUE&quot; macro in perlapi was simply wrong
  in stating that get-magic is not processed. It has been corrected.

<i>op manipulation functions</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Several API functions that process optrees have been newly documented.

<i>perlvar revamp</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
perlvar reorders the variables and groups them by topic. Each variable
  introduced after Perl 5.000 notes the first version in which it is available.
  perlvar also has a new section for deprecated variables to note when they were
  removed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Array and hash slices in scalar context</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
These are now documented in perldata.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i></i><i>&quot;use locale&quot;</i><i> and formats</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
perlform and perllocale have been corrected to state that &quot;use locale&quot;
  affects formats.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>overload</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
overload's documentation has practically undergone a rewrite. It is now much
  more straightforward and clear.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>perlhack and perlrepository revamp</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The perlhack document is now much shorter, and focuses on the Perl 5 development
  process and submitting patches to Perl. The technical content has been moved
  to several new documents, perlsource, perlinterp, perlhacktut, and
  perlhacktips. This technical content has been only lightly edited.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The perlrepository document has been renamed to perlgit. This new document is
  just a how-to on using git with the Perl source code. Any other content that
  used to be in perlrepository has been moved to perlhack.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Time::Piece examples</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Examples in perlfaq4 have been updated to show the use of Time::Piece.

<i>CLONE_PARAMS structure added to ease correct thread creation</i>

Modules that create threads should now create &quot;CLONE_PARAMS&quot;
  structures by calling the new function <i>Perl_clone_params_new()</i>, and
  free them with <i>Perl_clone_params_del()</i>. This will ensure compatibility

<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Hints hash API</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
A new C API for introspecting the hinthash &quot;%^H&quot; at runtime has been
  added. See &quot;cop_hints_2hv&quot;, &quot;cop_hints_fetchpvn&quot;,
  &quot;cop_hints_fetchpvs&quot;, &quot;cop_hints_fetchsv&quot;, and
  &quot;hv_copy_hints_hv&quot; in perlapi for details.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A new, experimental API has been added for accessing the internal structure that
  Perl uses for &quot;%^H&quot;. See the functions beginning with
  &quot;cophh_&quot; in perlapi.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>C interface to </i><i>caller()</i><i></i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The &quot;caller_cx&quot; function has been added as an XSUB-writer's equivalent
  of <i>caller()</i>. See perlapi for details.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Custom per-subroutine check hooks</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
XS code in an extension module can now annotate a subroutine (whether
  implemented in XS or in Perl) so that nominated XS code will be called at
  compile time (specifically as part of op checking) to change the op tree of
  that subroutine. The compile-time check function (supplied by the extension
  module) can implement argument processing that can't be expressed as a
  prototype, generate customised compile-time warnings, perform constant folding
  for a pure function, inline a subroutine consisting of sufficiently simple
  ops, replace the whole call with a custom op, and so on. This was previously
  all possible by hooking the &quot;entersub&quot; op checker, but the new
  mechanism makes it easy to tie the hook to a specific subroutine. See
  &quot;cv_set_call_checker&quot; in perlapi.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To help in writing custom check hooks, several subtasks within standard
  &quot;entersub&quot; op checking have been separated out and exposed in the
  API.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Improved support for custom OPs</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Custom ops can now be registered with the new &quot;custom_op_register&quot; C
  function and the &quot;XOP&quot; structure. This will make it easier to add
  new properties of custom ops in the future. Two new properties have been added
  already, &quot;xop_class&quot; and &quot;xop_peep&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;xop_class&quot; is one of the OA_*OP constants. It allows B and other
  introspection mechanisms to work with custom ops that aren't BASEOPs.
  &quot;xop_peep&quot; is a pointer to a function that will be called for ops of
  this type from &quot;Perl_rpeep&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
See &quot;Custom Operators&quot; in perlguts and &quot;Custom Operators&quot; in
  perlapi for more detail.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The old &quot;PL_custom_op_names&quot;/&quot;PL_custom_op_descs&quot; interface
  is still supported but discouraged.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Scope hooks</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
It is now possible for XS code to hook into Perl's lexical scope mechanism at
  compile time, using the new &quot;Perl_blockhook_register&quot; function. See
  &quot;Compile-time scope hooks&quot; in perlguts.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>The recursive part of the peephole optimizer is now hookable</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
In addition to &quot;PL_peepp&quot;, for hooking into the toplevel peephole
  optimizer, a &quot;PL_rpeepp&quot; is now available to hook into the optimizer
  recursing into side-chains of the optree.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>New non-magical variants of existing functions</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The following functions/macros have been added to the API. The *_nomg macros are
  equivalent to their non-&quot;_nomg&quot; variants, except that they ignore
  get-magic. Those ending in &quot;_flags&quot; allow one to specify whether
  get-magic is processed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  sv_2bool_flags
  SvTRUE_nomg
  sv_2nv_flags
  SvNV_nomg
  sv_cmp_flags
  sv_cmp_locale_flags
  sv_eq_flags
  sv_collxfrm_flags
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
In some of these cases, the non-&quot;_flags&quot; functions have been replaced
  with wrappers around the new functions.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>pv/pvs/sv versions of existing functions</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Many functions ending with pvn now have equivalent &quot;pv/pvs/sv&quot;
  versions.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>List op-building functions</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
List op-building functions have been added to the API. See op_append_elem,
  op_append_list, and op_prepend_elem in perlapi.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i></i><i>&quot;LINKLIST&quot;</i><i></i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The LINKLIST macro, part of op building that constructs the execution-order op
  chain, has been added to the API.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Localisation functions</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The &quot;save_freeop&quot;, &quot;save_op&quot;, &quot;save_pushi32ptr&quot;
  and &quot;save_pushptrptr&quot; functions have been added to the API.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Stash names</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
A stash can now have a list of effective names in addition to its usual name.
  The first effective name can be accessed via the &quot;HvENAME&quot; macro,
  which is now the recommended name to use in MRO linearisations
  (&quot;HvNAME&quot; being a fallback if there is no &quot;HvENAME&quot;).
<div class="Pp"></div>
These names are added and deleted via &quot;hv_ename_add&quot; and
  &quot;hv_ename_delete&quot;. These two functions are <i>not</i> part of the
  API.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>New functions for finding and removing magic</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The &quot;mg_findext()&quot; and &quot;sv_unmagicext()&quot; functions have been
  added to the API. They allow extension authors to find and remove magic
  attached to scalars based on both the magic type and the magic virtual table,
  similar to how <i>sv_magicext()</i> attaches magic of a certain type and with
  a given virtual table to a scalar. This eliminates the need for extensions to
  walk the list of &quot;MAGIC&quot; pointers of an &quot;SV&quot; to find the
  magic that belongs to them.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i></i><i>&quot;find_rundefsv&quot;</i><i></i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This function returns the SV representing $_, whether it's lexical or dynamic.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i></i><i>&quot;Perl_croak_no_modify&quot;</i><i></i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Perl_croak_no_modify()</i> is short-hand for &quot;Perl_croak(&quot;%s&quot;,
  PL_no_modify)&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i></i><i>&quot;PERL_STATIC_INLINE&quot;</i><i> define</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The &quot;PERL_STATIC_INLINE&quot; define has been added to provide the
  best-guess incantation to use for static inline functions, if the C compiler
  supports C99-style static inline. If it doesn't, it'll give a plain
  &quot;static&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;HAS_STATIC_INLINE&quot; can be used to check if the compiler actually
  supports inline functions.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>New </i><i>&quot;pv_escape&quot;</i><i> option for hexadecimal escapes</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
A new option, &quot;PERL_PV_ESCAPE_NONASCII&quot;, has been added to
  &quot;pv_escape&quot; to dump all characters above ASCII in hexadecimal.
  Before, one could get all characters as hexadecimal or the Latin1 non-ASCII as
  octal.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i></i><i>&quot;lex_start&quot;</i><i></i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;lex_start&quot; has been added to the API, but is considered experimental.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i></i><i>op_scope()</i><i> and </i><i>op_lvalue()</i><i></i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <i>op_scope()</i> and <i>op_lvalue()</i> functions have been added to the
  API, but are considered experimental.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="C_API_Changes"><a class="selflink" href="#C_API_Changes">C
  API Changes</a></h2>
<i></i><i>&quot;PERL_POLLUTE&quot;</i><i> has been removed</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The option to define &quot;PERL_POLLUTE&quot; to expose older 5.005 symbols for
  backwards compatibility has been removed. Its use was always discouraged, and
  MakeMaker contains a more specific escape hatch:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    perl Makefile.PL POLLUTE=1
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This can be used for modules that have not been upgraded to 5.6 naming
  conventions (and really should be completely obsolete by now).
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Check API compatibility when loading XS modules</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
When Perl's API changes in incompatible ways (which usually happens between
  major releases), XS modules compiled for previous versions of Perl will no
  longer work. They need to be recompiled against the new Perl.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The &quot;XS_APIVERSION_BOOTCHECK&quot; macro has been added to ensure that
  modules are recompiled and to prevent users from accidentally loading modules
  compiled for old perls into newer perls. That macro, which is called when
  loading every newly compiled extension, compares the API version of the
  running perl with the version a module has been compiled for and raises an
  exception if they don't match.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Perl_fetch_cop_label</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The first argument of the C API function &quot;Perl_fetch_cop_label&quot; has
  changed from &quot;struct refcounted_he *&quot; to &quot;COP *&quot;, to
  insulate the user from implementation details.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This API function was marked as &quot;may change&quot;, and likely isn't in use
  outside the core. (Neither an unpacked CPAN nor Google's codesearch finds any
  other references to it.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i></i><i>GvCV()</i><i> and </i><i>GvGP()</i><i> are no longer lvalues</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The new <i>GvCV_set()</i> and <i>GvGP_set()</i> macros are now provided to
  replace assignment to those two macros.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This allows a future commit to eliminate some backref magic between GV and CVs,
  which will require complete control over assignment to the &quot;gp_cv&quot;
  slot.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i></i><i>CvGV()</i><i> is no longer an lvalue</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Under some circumstances, the <i>CvGV()</i> field of a CV is now
  reference-counted. To ensure consistent behaviour, direct assignment to it,
  for example &quot;CvGV(cv) = gv&quot; is now a compile-time error. A new
  macro, &quot;CvGV_set(cv,gv)&quot; has been introduced to run this operation
  safely. Note that modification of this field is not part of the public API,
  regardless of this new macro (and despite its being listed in this section).
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i></i><i>CvSTASH()</i><i> is no longer an lvalue</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <i>CvSTASH()</i> macro can now only be used as an rvalue.
  <i>CvSTASH_set()</i> has been added to replace assignment to <i>CvSTASH()</i>.
  This is to ensure that backreferences are handled properly. These macros are
  not part of the API.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Calling conventions for </i><i>&quot;newFOROP&quot;</i><i> and
  </i><i>&quot;newWHILEOP&quot;</i> <i></i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The way the parser handles labels has been cleaned up and refactored. As a
  result, the <i>newFOROP()</i> constructor function no longer takes a parameter
  stating what label is to go in the state op.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <i>newWHILEOP()</i> and <i>newFOROP()</i> functions no longer accept a line
  number as a parameter.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Flags passed to </i><i>&quot;uvuni_to_utf8_flags&quot;</i><i> and
  </i><i>&quot;utf8n_to_uvuni&quot;</i> <i></i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Some of the flags parameters to <i>uvuni_to_utf8_flags()</i> and
  <i>utf8n_to_uvuni()</i> have changed. This is a result of Perl's now allowing
  internal storage and manipulation of code points that are problematic in some
  situations. Hence, the default actions for these functions has been
  complemented to allow these code points. The new flags are documented in
  perlapi. Code that requires the problematic code points to be rejected needs
  to change to use the new flags. Some flag names are retained for backward
  source compatibility, though they do nothing, as they are now the default.
  However the flags &quot;UNICODE_ALLOW_FDD0&quot;,
  &quot;UNICODE_ALLOW_FFFF&quot;, &quot;UNICODE_ILLEGAL&quot;, and

<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Other_Internal_Changes"><a class="selflink" href="#Other_Internal_Changes">Other
  Internal Changes</a></h2>
<i>Stack unwinding</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The protocol for unwinding the C stack at the last stage of a &quot;die&quot;
  has changed how it identifies the target stack frame. This now uses a separate
  variable &quot;PL_restartjmpenv&quot;, where previously it relied on the
  &quot;blk_eval.cur_top_env&quot; pointer in the &quot;eval&quot; context frame
  that has nominally just been discarded. This change means that code running
  during various stages of Perl-level unwinding no longer needs to take care to
  avoid destroying the ghost frame.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Scope stack entries</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The format of entries on the scope stack has been changed, resulting in a
  reduction of memory usage of about 10%. In particular, the memory used by the
  scope stack to record each active lexical variable has been halved.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Memory allocation for pointer tables</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Memory allocation for pointer tables has been changed. Previously
  &quot;Perl_ptr_table_store&quot; allocated memory from the same arena system
  as &quot;SV&quot; bodies and &quot;HE&quot;s, with freed memory remaining
  bound to those arenas until interpreter exit. Now it allocates memory from
  arenas private to the specific pointer table, and that memory is returned to
  the system when &quot;Perl_ptr_table_free&quot; is called. Additionally,
  allocation and release are both less CPU intensive.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i></i><i>&quot;UNDERBAR&quot;</i><i></i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The &quot;UNDERBAR&quot; macro now calls &quot;find_rundefsv&quot;.
  &quot;dUNDERBAR&quot; is now a noop but should still be used to ensure past
  and future compatibility.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>String comparison routines renamed</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The &quot;ibcmp_*&quot; functions have been renamed and are now called
  &quot;foldEQ&quot;, &quot;foldEQ_locale&quot;, and &quot;foldEQ_utf8&quot;.
  The old names are still available as macros.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i></i><i>&quot;chop&quot;</i><i> and </i><i>&quot;chomp&quot;</i><i>
  implementations merged</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The opcode bodies for &quot;chop&quot; and &quot;chomp&quot; and for
  &quot;schop&quot; and &quot;schomp&quot; have been merged. The implementation
  functions <i>Perl_do_chop()</i> and <i>Perl_do_chomp()</i>, never part of the
  public API, have been merged and moved to a static function in <i>pp.c</i>.
  This shrinks the Perl binary slightly, and should not affect any code outside
  the core (unless it is relying on the order of side-effects when
  &quot;chomp&quot; is passed a <i>list</i> of values).

    are both true. Previously, there were many bugs with this feature. What
      hasn't been fixed are the places where the pattern contains the multiple
      characters, but the characters are split up by other things, such as in
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
 &quot;\N{LATIN SMALL LIGATURE FFI}&quot; =~ /(f)(f)i/ui

      Unicode Standard is currently in flux about what they will recommend doing

<div class="Pp"></div>
This is woefully incomplete as it's automatically generated from version control
  history. In particular, it doesn't include the names of the (very much
  appreciated) contributors who reported issues in previous versions of Perl
  that helped make Perl 5.14.0 better. For a more complete list of all of Perl's
  historical contributors, please see the &quot;AUTHORS&quot; file in the Perl
  5.14.0 distribution.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Many of the changes included in this version originated in the CPAN modules
  included in Perl's core. We're grateful to the entire CPAN community for
  helping Perl to flourish.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Reporting_Bugs"><a class="selflink" href="#Reporting_Bugs">Reporting
  Bugs</a></h1>
If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently
  posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the Perl bug database at
  http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/ . There may also be information at
  http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug program
  included with your release. Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
  sufficient test case. Your bug report, along with the output of &quot;perl
  -V&quot;, will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl
  porting team.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it
  inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send it
  to perl5-security-report@perl.org. This points to a closed subscription
  unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core committers, who are able
  to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help
  co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all
  platforms on which Perl is supported. Please use this address for security
  issues in the Perl core <i>only</i>, not for modules independently distributed
  on CPAN.
