<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
cfdptest - CFDP test shell for ION</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
cfdptest [ commands_filename ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
cfdptest provides a mechanism for testing CFDP file
transmission. It can be used in either scripted or
interactive mode. All bundles containing CFDP PDUs are sent
with custody <br>
transfer requested and with all bundle status reporting
disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When scripted with
commands_filename, cfdptest operates in response to CFDP
management commands contained in the provided commands file.
Each line of text in the file is <br>
interpreted as a single command comprising several tokens: a
one-character command code and, in most cases, one or more
command arguments of one or more characters. The commands
<br>
configure and initiate CFDP file transmission
operations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no file is specified,
cfdptest instead offers the user an interactive
&quot;shell&quot; for command entry. cfdptest prints a
prompt string (&quot;: &quot;) to stdout, accepts strings of
text <br>
from stdin, and interprets each string as a command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The supported cfdptest commands
(whether interactive or scripted) are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">? The help command. This will
display a listing of the commands and their formats. It is
the same as the h command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">h An alternate form of the help
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">d &lt;destination CFDP entity ID
number&gt; <br>
The destination command. This command establishes the CFDP
entity to which the next file transmission operation will be
directed. CFDP entity numbers in ION are, by <br>
convention, the same as BP node numbers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f &lt;source file path name&gt;
<br>
The from command. This command identifies the file that will
be transmitted when the next file transmission operation is
commanded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">t &lt;destination file path
name&gt; <br>
The to command. This command provides the name for the file
that will be created at the receiving entity when the next
file transmission operation is commanded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">l &lt;lifetime in seconds&gt;
<br>
The time-to-live command. This command establishes the
time-to-live for all subsequently issued bundles containing
CFDP PDUs. If not specified, the default value 86400 (1 <br>
day) is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">p &lt;priority&gt; <br>
The priority command. This command establishes the priority
(class of service) for all subsequently issued bundles
containing CFDP PDUs. Valid values are 0, 1, and 2. If <br>
not specified, priority is 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o &lt;ordinal&gt; <br>
The ordinal command. This command establishes the
&quot;ordinal&quot; (sub-priority within priority 2) for all
subsequently issued bundles containing CFDP PDUs. Valid
values are <br>
0-254. If not specified, ordinal is 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">m &lt;mode&gt; <br>
The mode command. This command establishes the transmission
mode (&quot;best-effort&quot; or assured) for all
subsequently issued bundles containing CFDP PDUs. Valid
values are 0 <br>
(assured, reliable, with reliability provided by a reliable
DTN convergence layer protocol), 1 (best-effort,
unreliable), and 2 (assured, reliable, but with reliability
<br>
provided by BP custody transfer). If not specified,
transmission mode is 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">g &lt;srrflags&gt; <br>
The srrflags command. This command establishes the BP status
reporting that will be requested for all subsequently issued
bundles containing CFDP PDUs. srrflags must be a <br>
status reporting flags string as defined for bptrace(1): a
sequence of status report flags, separated by commas, with
no embedded whitespace. Each status report flag must be <br>
one of the following: rcv, ct, fwd, dlv, del.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c &lt;criticality&gt; <br>
The criticality command. This command establishes the
criticality for all subsequently issued bundles containing
CFDP PDUs. Valid values are 0 (not critical) and 1 <br>
(critical). If not specified, criticality is 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">r &lt;action code nbr&gt;
&lt;first path name&gt; &lt;second path name&gt; <br>
The filestore request command. This command adds a filestore
request to the metadata that will be issued when the next
file transmission operation is commanded. Action code <br>
numbers are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 = create file <br>
1 = delete file <br>
2 = rename file <br>
3 = append file <br>
4 = replace file <br>
5 = create directory <br>
6 = remove directory <br>
7 = deny file <br>
8 = deny directory <br>
u &rsquo;&lt;message text&gt;&rsquo; <br>
The user message command. This command adds a user message
to the metadata that will be issued when the next file
transmission operation is commanded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&amp; The send command. This
command initiates file transmission as configured by the
most recent preceding d, f, and t commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^ The cancel command. This
command cancels the most recently initiated file
transmission.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% The suspend command. This
command suspends the most recently initiated file
transmission.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ The resume command. This
command resumes the most recently initiated file
transmission.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># The report command. This
command reports on the most recently initiated file
transmission.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">q The quit command. Terminates
the cfdptest program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cfdptest in interactive mode
also spawns a CFDP event handling thread. The event thread
receives CFDP service indications and simply prints lines of
text to stdout to announce <br>
them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE that when cfdptest runs in
scripted mode it does not spawn an event handling thread,
which makes it possible for the CFDP events queue to grow
indefinitely unless some other <br>
task consumes and reports on the events. One simple solution
is to run an interactive cfdptest task in background, simply
to keep the event queue cleared, while scripted non- <br>
interactive cfdptest tasks are run in the foreground.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
&quot;0&quot; cfdptest has terminated. Any problems
encountered during operation will be noted in the ion.log
log file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
See above for details on valid commands_filename
commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
No environment variables apply.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
Diagnostic messages produced by cfdptest are written to the
ION log file ion.log.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t open command file...
<br>
The file identified by commands_filename doesn&rsquo;t
exist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cfdptest can&rsquo;t initialize
CFDP. <br>
cfdpadmin has not yet initialized CFDP operations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t put FDU. <br>
The attempt to initiate file transmission failed. See the
ION log for additional diagnostic messages from the CFDP
library.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Failed getting CFDP event. <br>
The attempt to retrieve a CFDP service indication failed.
See the ION log for additional diagnostic messages from the
CFDP library.</p>
