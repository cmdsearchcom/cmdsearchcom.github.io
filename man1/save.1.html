<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
save - save revision of a file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
save [ version binding options ] [ options ] files .. <br>
Save [ version binding options ] [ options ] files ..</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options: [ -?fglq ] [ -help ] [
-a (or -alias) version alias ] [ -delta ] [ -force ] [ -fix
generation | alias | date ] [ -newgen ] [ -lock ] [ -m (or
-logmsg) message ] <br>
[ -n (or -setvnum) version number ] [ -nodelta ] [ -quiet ]
[ -setattrs filename ] [ -stdin ] [ -version ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
save takes a snapshot of the current state of the specified
files, stores them into corresponding archive files and
assigns unique version numbers to the created versions. The
<br>
original files will by default be removed and unlocked in
order to support a cooperative style of teamwork. Versions
of files can be restored as regular files with the retrv
com&acirc; <br>
mand. Versions in archives are inalterable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An archive will be created the
first time a file is saved in a subdirectory named AtFS. The
AtFS subdirectory must be present. When an archive is
created, save asks for a short <br>
description of the saved documents purpose. If a subsequent
version is saved, the user is prompted for a comment
describing the modifications. The save command requires that
the <br>
version history of a file that shall be saved is locked by
the user issuing the command. This is to prevent different
developers from applying concurrent updates to the same <br>
file and thereby invalidating the other developers&rsquo;
modifications. The only exception from this rule is the
first time a file is saved, which means that an archive has
yet to be <br>
created. For more details on locking, see the ShapeTools
Tutorial, retrv(1), and vadm(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The save program assigns unique
version ids to each evolving revision of a file. The version
id is a pair of integers separated by a dot, identifying the
major and minor revision <br>
(&lt;generation&gt;.&lt;revision&gt;) of a version.
Subsequent invocations of save increase the minor revision
number, starting with version 1.0. The generation number is
increased by invo&acirc; <br>
cations of Save (see below). There is no support for
explicit branching. The version control toolkit rather
encourages a linear model of version evolution. Instead of
branching, <br>
save allows to insert new versions into old generations (see
description of -fix). This allows, for example, to fix bugs
in major revision N (version numbers N.x) which may be <br>
the currently operational release while development proceeds
in generation N+1 (or N+n if you like).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Before a file is saved it will
be checked whether it has actually changed with respect to
the previously saved version. If the file hasn&rsquo;t
changed, the user will be asked if it <br>
should be saved anyway. The command line option -f (or
-force) overrides the prompting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The version control system
supports a built-in basic status model for versions. The
version status is intended to express different levels of
quality, and aims at providing basic <br>
project management functionality. State attributes of
software objects can help to describe an object&rsquo;s
current meaning in the development process (e.g. tested,
incompletely <br>
implemented, submitted for evaluation, or shipped to
customer).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A newly created version will by
default be assigned the state saved. This status marks the
lowest level of quality, suggesting that the version is just
saved for possible later <br>
retrieval but may be inconsistent. Versions that meet higher
quality standards (or are part of a release) should be
marked by appropriate status (see vadm -promote, sbmt, or
<br>
publ).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the program is invoked as
Save (that is with capital-S) a new major revision
(generation) of the document history is created - provided
the programmer issuing the command has <br>
the permission to do this. This option is intended to
support a development model where maintenance of an
operational release can be performed parallel to the
development of the <br>
next release (see -fix).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
For version selection, any version binding option, as
described on the vbind(1) manual page, may be given. Version
bind directives in brackets added to the filename are
inter&acirc; <br>
preted different to vbind(1). A version number following the
name will be treated as if the -n (-setvnum) option was
given with this version number as argument. Any other string
<br>
in brackets will be taken as alias name (see -alias
option).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-?, -help <br>
print short information about usage of this command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a, -alias version alias <br>
assign a version alias (a symbolic name) to the new version.
In more detail, an attribute __SymbolicName__ is set to the
value specified in version alias. The specified <br>
alias name must not be assigned to any other version within
the same version history. Alternatively to the -a option,
the version alias may be given in brackets following <br>
the name of the file to be saved. Check the description of
the -n option for an example of this notation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-delta Create delta for internal
storage. This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, -force <br>
force a revision deposit (i.e. without asking), even if the
busy version hasn&rsquo;t changed since the last time it was
saved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fix generation | alias | date
<br>
append a new version after the most recent version within
the referenced major revision level. The major revision
level (called &lsquo;&lsquo;generation&rsquo;&rsquo;) is
either referenced <br>
explicitly, by specifying a number, or implicitly, by
specifying a version alias (e.g. a release name) or a date.
The latter form is particularly useful for saving a fix <br>
that extends over more than one object.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is intended to
support maintenance of older releases while development
proceeds at the logical end of the version chain. In order
to insert a (fixed) version <br>
into an old generation, one must have a lock on the most
recent version of that generation (generation lock). This
lock must be set with the vadm command. The -fix option <br>
is incompatible with -setvnum, -newgen and the Save command
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g, -newgen <br>
create a major revision of the document. Major revisions are
indicated by the first number in the version-id
(generation). Only the archive administrator is allowed to
<br>
create major revisions. The archive administrator is the
user who owns the AtFS subdirectory where the version
archives reside. Use of this switch is identical to calling
<br>
the program as Save.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, -lock <br>
Keep the lock on the version history. The saved files will
not be removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m, -logmsg message <br>
set message as descriptive note for all document versions
that result from the invocation of save. When message starts
with an at sign (@), it is interpreted as filename <br>
and the text contained in the file is set as descriptive
note for all document versions that result from the
invocation of save.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, -setvnum version number <br>
set the version number of the newly created revision to
version. The version must be given in the format
&lt;generation&gt;.&lt;revision&gt; where generation and
revision are inte&acirc; <br>
gers. Example: <br>
save -setvnum 4.3 mkattr.c <br>
The specified version must be greater than the highest
previously assigned version number in a given object
history. Only the archive administrator may set version
numbers <br>
directly. The archive administrator is the user who owns the
AtFS subdirectory where the version archives reside.
-setvnum is useful for keeping consistent version
number&acirc; <br>
ing across related, physically different object
repositories, or for converting archive formats of other
revision control systems to this toolkit (see: rcs2atfs).
Alterna&acirc; <br>
tively to the -n option, the version number may be given in
brackets following the name of the file to be saved. The
command <br>
save mkattr.c[4.3] <br>
is interpreted the same way as the example above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nodelta <br>
Suppress delta generation</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q, -quiet <br>
quiet operation. No messages are printed on standard output.
If the busy version is unchanged, it will not be saved
unless -f is set. The user will not be prompted for a <br>
descriptive note. If no message or note is supplied with the
command line (see options -m and -t) the log will remain
empty. This option is useful for batch operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-setattrs filename <br>
read names and values of user defined attributes from the
file filename. The entries in the attribute file must have
either of the formats NAME=VALUE or NAME+=VALUE. NAME <br>
must be an alphanumeric string (no spaces) immediately
followed by the assignment operator. The value may be an
arbitrary ASCII string with the exception of control-A and
<br>
newline characters. There is exactly one attribute
definition per line. The file&rsquo;s last character must be
a newline character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the first format (single
equal symbol) is used, previously assigned values of user
defined attributes are reset with the values defined in the
attribute file. The sec&acirc; <br>
ond format (&lsquo;&lsquo;plus equal&rsquo;&rsquo;) allows
to append additional values to an already existing
attribute. If no attribute of a given name exists, it will
be created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This way to attach attributes
was introduced to allow quick automatic attachment of a
large number of attributes to version objects. This
interface to the attribute set&acirc; <br>
ting facility is mainly intended for tools that invoke
save.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -setattrs option is
omitted, save searches the environment for a variable
SVATTRS. If this variable is absent, no user defined
attributes will be assigned to the <br>
evolving versions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-stdin force save to read a
descriptive note from stdin instead of forking an editor. A
previously set intent-message is printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-version <br>
print the version of the program itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
All revisions of documents are stored in archive files in
the subdirectory AtFS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
With the -g (-newgen) option given and an unchanged busy
version, save ignores the users answer to the question, if
the busy version should be saved anyway. It always assumes a
<br>
positive answer and goes on with its saving procedure. You
can avoid saving by interrupting (Ctrl-C) save during the
next question if the unmodified version should be commented
<br>
anyway.</p>
