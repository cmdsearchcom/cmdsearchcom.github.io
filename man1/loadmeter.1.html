<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
loadmeter is a utility to monitor various system resources.
It runs (currently) under Linux and Solaris systems running
the X Window System. It displays information about system
<br>
hostname, load average, uptime, disk usage and memory
information. loadmeter uses the /proc filesystem to gather
most of this information under Linux, and under Solaris it
reads <br>
kernel symbols (What a headache!). In its normal state it
displays a window with a coloured bar graph showing the load
average for the past minute. This is also shown in digits
<br>
at the top of the window. Both are updated every second. A
red notch marks the maximum load since loadmeter was
started, and can be reset by pressing Button2 or hidden with
But&acirc; <br>
ton3. A blue notch shows the 5 minute load average.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By clicking with Button1, a
pop-up window appears showing the uptime, the load average
for the past 1, 5 and 15 minutes, the capacity of each
filesystem, and memory/swap usage. <br>
More detailed information on each filesystem is available by
highlighting the corresponding one. The way this window pops
down is intentional, just to make it interesting. :) <br>
(Can be disabled with -noshrink).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any filesystems with higher
usage than specified by the -warn option (default 90%) are
shown with a (default) green background in the popup menu.
If the -disk option is speci&acirc; <br>
fied, the text &rsquo;disk&rsquo; appears on the main window
if the usage of any filesystem exceeds the value given by
-warn, or 90% if that option is not supplied. Popping up the
stats win&acirc; <br>
dow causes this message to go away, until either another
filesystem exceeds this value, or the usage of the
filesystem that filled falls below the warning value and
then subse&acirc; <br>
quently exceeds it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Press Escape within the top
level window to exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following bindings are in
effect if either the -override or -parent options is
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ctrl-button1 lowers the window
(-override only).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ctrl-button2 raises and moves
the window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ctrl-button3 raises and resizes
the window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A SIGUSR1 sent to the loadmeter
process will also raise the top level window. This can be
used to raise a window that has been obscured by a parent
that was specified with the <br>
-parent option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The following options are available. They may be abbreviated
so long as ambiguity is not reached.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-display dpy <br>
Specifies which X server to connect to. If unspecified, the
value of the environment variable DISPLAY is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-geometry geometry <br>
Sets the initial geometry of the top level window, given in
standard XxY+W+H format. The default is 40x100.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-name name <br>
The name of the application to present to the window
manager.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-numfont font <br>
Use the specified font for the load average digits on the
top level window. The default is 6x10. Rastermans nexus font
is highly recommended.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-labelfont font <br>
Use the specified font for the label displayed behind the
bar graph. The default is
-schumacher-clean-medium-r-*-*-7-*-*-*-*-*-*-*.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-label label <br>
Specify the string to be displayed behind the bar graph. The
default is the hostname given by uname(2).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-popupfont font <br>
Use the specified font for the text in the popup menus. The
default is -misc-fixed-medium-r-*-*-10-*-*-*-*-*-*-*.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-popupbg colour <br>
Sets the background colour of the popup menus. Default is
grey30.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-popupfg colour <br>
Sets the foreground colour of the popup menus. Default is
yellow.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-warn percent <br>
Causes the menu entry for a particular filesystem to be
highlighted if the usage for it is greater than the given
percentage. The default is 90%.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-warnbg colour <br>
Specify the colour to use for highlighting a filesystem
whose usage is greater than or equal to 90% or whichever is
specified with the -warn option. The default is sea&acirc;
<br>
green4.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-meter colour <br>
Specify the colour to use for the bar in the graphical
representation of filesystem usages. The default is
black.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-override <br>
Causes loadmeter to set the override_redirect bit on the top
level window. This will then cause it to bypass the window
manager and display itself undecorated on the root <br>
window. This is useful for using it with window managers
such as Enlightenment (to DR 0.13 at least) which insist on
decorating all top level windows. With this option set, <br>
the built in move and resize features are enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sync Causes loadmeter to call
sync(2) each time it checks the disk usages. This can slow
things down on systems with busy filesystems, but is more
accurate as the filesystems <br>
are properly synced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-bh height <br>
Specify the height in pixels of each of the bars (blocks) in
the main bar graph. The default is two pixels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-parent window <br>
This option allows you to specify a particular window for
loadmeter to use as its parent window. Normally loadmeter
will attempt to map itself onto the root window, however
<br>
there may be times when you wish to map it as a child of
another window on the screen. The author uses this to map
several instances of loadmeter onto an xclock window, <br>
making it easy to move the bank around by just moving the
xclock window. It&rsquo;s left as an exercise to the reader
to think of other uses for this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-disk Causes a warning message
on the top level window to be given when the usage of a
filesystem exceeds 90%, or the value given by -warn. The
warning goes away when the stats <br>
window is popped up, until either another filesystem&rsquo;s
usage is excessive or the usage of the filesystem that
caused the warning falls below the threshold and then
subse&acirc; <br>
quently exceeds it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-noshrink <br>
Disables the slow-popdown eye candy feature of the stats
window. This option is useful for slow network connections
to the display and/or when there is a large number of <br>
filesystems being monitored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nogeom <br>
Disables the displaying of the window geometry in the cursor
as the main window is being moved or resized.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that -override and -parent
cannot both be given in the same instance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RESOURCES <br>
loadmeter reads the X server database for several resources
that can be used to specify options for all instances of
loadmeter running on the display. The resources have the
same <br>
names as each of the command line options, thus there is no
point specifying them here again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Boolean options (i.e. those that
don&rsquo;t take an argument) are enabled by setting the
corresponding resource to True.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LICENSE <br>
loadmeter is covered by the GNU General Public License
(GPL).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
loadmeter does no checking as to whether a colour was
successfully allocated by the X server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Memory info in Solaris
isn&rsquo;t particularly correct. Patches for this would be
appreciated...</p>
