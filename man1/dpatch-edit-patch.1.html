DPATCH-EDIT-PATCH(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
dpatch-edit-patch - maintain dpatch patches for a Debian
source package</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
dpatch-edit-patch [options] command dpatchname
[basepatch]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This manual documents the dpatch-edit-patch command which
maintains dpatch patches for a dpatch-using Debian source
package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dpatch-edit-patch will copy the
full tree to a temporary directory for working.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WARNING <br>
dpatch is deprecated, please switch to the &lsquo;3.0
(quilt)&rsquo; Debian source package format instead. See
http://wiki.debian.org/Projects/DebSrc3.0#FAQ for a short
guide on how to do <br>
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
dpatch-edit-patch takes two forms of arguments; options and
commands. Currently, the only command that exists is
&acirc;patch&acirc;, which allows you to create/edit
dpatches. When no com&acirc; <br>
mand is given, &acirc;patch&acirc; is assumed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMANDS: <br>
patch This command requires one mandatory argument, and
accepts one optional argument under certain circumstances.
The mandatory argument is dpatchname. This refers to a <br>
dpatch, as it would be listed in debian/patches/00list. It
is not necessary for dpatchname to exist prior to running
dpatch-edit-patch patch dpatchname.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When dpatchname exists,
dpatch-edit-patch will set up a working source tree, apply
all dpatches listed in debian/patches/00list up to and
including dpatchname, and spawn <br>
an interactive shell for the developer. The developer then
edits files in this working tree. When the developer is
done, they exit the shell. dpatch-edit-patch then <br>
updates dpatchname to reflect the changes made. Should the
developer wish to abort the process from the interactive
shell, they need only cause the shell to exit with an <br>
exit value of 230. Typically, this is done by exiting the
shell with the command exit 230.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Would the developer wish to see
the patch one&rsquo;s currently works on without exiting the
subshell, two environment variables are exported into the
subshell to help with <br>
this: DPEP_SHELL_REFDIR, which is set to the reference
directory&rsquo;s full name, and DPEP_SHELL_WORKDIR, which
is set to the subshell&rsquo;s working directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These two can be used to - for
example - generate a diff between the reference version and
the current tree:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">diff -urNa $DPEP_SHELL_REFDIR
$DPEP_SHELL_WORKDIR</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When dpatchname does not exist,
dpatch-edit-patch will assume that a new dpatch should be
created. As with the above scenario, dpatch-edit-patch first
creates a working source <br>
tree. If the optional argument basepatch is supplied, all
dpatches in debian/patches/00list up to and including
basepatch will be applied to the working tree. If basepatch
is <br>
not supplied, no dpatches are applied to the working tree.
When then developer exits the shell, dpatch-edit-patch will
create dpatchname. If debian/patches/00template does not
<br>
exist, a hardcoded dpatch header and shell snippet will be
used. If it exists and is not executable, it will be copied
verbatim as the header and shell snippet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Its first parameter is the base
filename of the to-be-updated or to-be-created dpatch
(useful for adding titles to the dpatch header). Its second
parameter will be the descrip&acirc; <br>
tion of the new patch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
For the following options, command-line arguments take
precedence over environment variables, which take precedence
over configuration variables. Configuration variables are
read <br>
from debian/patches/00dpatch.conf and ~/.dpatch.conf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --sourcedir=value <br>
Directory containing unpacked Debian source package.
Configuration variable conf_sourcedir (settable only in
~/.dpatch.conf), environment variable DPEP_SOURCEDIR. <br>
Defaults to the current working directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o, --outdir=value <br>
Directory where the updated or newly-created dpatch will be
placed. Configuration variable conf_outdir (~/.dpatch.conf),
environment variable DPEP_OUTDIR. Defaults to <br>
./debian/patches/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --clean <br>
Indicate to dpatch-edit-patch that the current work
directory can safely be cleaned. If not given,
dpatch-edit-patch tries to preserve partial or complete
builds by first <br>
copying the current work directory to a reference directory
before invoking debian/rules clean on the reference
directory. If given, the current directory is cleaned and
<br>
then taken as a reference directory. Use this option if your
source package is pretty large and no significant work is
destroyed by cleaning. Configuration variable <br>
conf_clean (~/.dpatch.conf), Environment variable
DPEP_CLEAN.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b, --debianonly[=path] <br>
Indicate to dpatch-edit-patch that the current work
directory only contains a debian subdirectory and that an
upstream tarball is to be unpacked in the reference
directory <br>
before copying the current work directory there. The
optional argument is the path to the upstream tarball -
including the tarball name. If no value is given, <br>
dpatch-edit-patch will use the hook script pointed to by
conf_getorigtargz (~/.dpatch.conf) or DPEP_GETORIGTARGZ to
obtain the upstream tarball. The hook script should <br>
take one argument: the destination directory where the
fetched archive shall be put. Configuration variables:
conf_debianonly (debian/patches/00dpatch.conf) and <br>
conf_origtargz (~/.dpatch.conf), Environment Variables
DPEP_DEBIANONLY and DPEP_ORIGTARGZ.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P, --origtargzpath=path <br>
When -b is in use, specify the path where upstream tarballs
should be looked for. path is a colon-separated list of
directories. Configuration variables: conf_origtargz&acirc;
<br>
path (~/.dpatch.conf), Environment Variables
DPEP_ORIGTARGZPATH.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, --rootcmd=value <br>
Command used to gain root privileges used to clean
DPEP_SOURCEDIR. Configuration variable conf_rootcmd,
environment variable DPEP_ROOTCMD. Defaults to fakeroot, if
<br>
installed. If none of the above are specified, and fakeroot
is not installed, dpatch-edit-patch will abort. The dpatch
authors strongly recommend the use of fakeroot for <br>
this purpose.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --description=value <br>
Description used for a newly-created patch. Configuration
variable conf_newdesc (~/.dpatch.conf), environment variable
DPEP_NEWDESC, defaults to &acirc;No description.&acirc;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k, --keeptemp=value <br>
Boolean value, either 0 or 1. Configuration variable
conf_keeptemp (~/.dpatch.conf), environment variable
DPEP_KEEPTEMP. When set to 1, temporary working tree is not
<br>
deleted when dpatch-edit-patch is done.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t, --tmpdir=value <br>
Temporary directory within which dpatch-edit-patch will
create the working source tree. Configuration variable
conf_tmpdir (~/.dpatch.conf), environment variable <br>
DPEP_TMPDIR. Should none of the above be set,
dpatch-edit-patch will first attempt to use the environment
variable TMPDIR, and will fall back to /tmp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, --stampdir=value <br>
The directory dpatch has used for creating patch stamps.
Used for checking if patch to be edited is already applied
to the working tree. Configuration variable <br>
conf_stampdir (~/.dpatch.conf), environment variable
DPEP_STAMPDIR. Should none of the above be set,
dpatch-edit-patch will fall back to debian/patched</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e, --exclude=valuelist <br>
Space-separated list of file- and directory names that
dpatch-edit-patch will exclude from being copied and diffed.
Configuration variable conf_exclude (~/.dpatch.conf), <br>
environment variable DPEP_EXCLUDE. Defaults to &quot;CVS
.svn .git .arch .hg _darcs .bzr&quot;, which might cause you
trouble if you use files named like that in your
package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O, --diffopts=valuelist <br>
Extra options to directly pass to diff as-is. Configuration
variable conf_diffopts (~/.dpatch.conf), environment
variable DPEP_DIFF_OPTIONS. It is empty by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, --shell=shell <br>
Tell dpatch-edit-patch which shell to invoke. Configuration
variable conf_shell (~/.dpatch.conf), environment variable
DPEP_SHELL, defaulting to $SHELL and the user&rsquo;s <br>
default shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --notimestamp <br>
Tell dpatch-edit-patch to remove timestamps from the diffs
it generates. Can also be set in debian/patches/00options,
with the DPEP_OMIT_TIMESTAMPS variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-0, --add2list <br>
add the new patch to 00list file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a, --applyall <br>
apply all available patches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
dpatch-edit-patch uses the DEBFULLNAME environment variable
as the author&rsquo;s name. If it is unset, the author name
will be left blank.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dpatch-edit-patch determines the
author&rsquo;s email address for new patches using the
following algorithm: <br>
1) Should the DEBEMAIL environment variable exist, it is
always used. <br>
2) If the EMAIL environment variable exists, it will be used
when DEBEMAIL does not exist. <br>
3) Should neither of the first two attempts succeed, the
email will be constructed using the login name of the user
running dpatch-edit-patch combined with the output of
hostname <br>
-f.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When dpatch-edit-patch sets up a
reference or a working directory, it dereferences all
symlinks in the source. That allows relative links to
continue working, and allows changes <br>
only to a single file and not to the linked file and the
link target. If you use dpatch-edit-patch on source trees
that have symbolic links, you might end up with a patch that
is <br>
unapplyable to the original tree.</p>
