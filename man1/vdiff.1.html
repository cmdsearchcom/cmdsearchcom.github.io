<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
vdiff - display line-by-line differences between versions of
files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
vdiff [ diff-options ] [ -base path ] [ -P ] files ..</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
vdiff is a differential comparator for file versions that
are stored in shapeTools&rsquo; object base, AtFS. The
functionality of vdiff is very similar to the diff command
on your <br>
host. All options and switches that are recognized by diff
can also be specified for vdiff.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The arguments to vdiff can
either be a single filename, or a pair of version
identifiers. If only a filename is specified, vdiff prints
the differences between the specified file <br>
and the most recent version of this file that is stored in
the AtFS object base. A file can be compared to any stored
version by specifying the version as first, and the filename
<br>
as second argument. If both arguments are version
identifiers, the difference between these two versions is
printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Differences between files and
versions can be printed in any style that is supported by
the local diff program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Version identifiers consist of
the filename, and a version number or alias name for a
version, enclosed in brackets. Example: <br>
retrieve.c[4.22] or retrieve.c[Rel-4.1]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vdiff creates temporary copies
of the versions that shall be compared, invokes the diff
command, and finally removes the temporary copies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-base path <br>
If vdiff is told to produce a context diff, the filenames of
the compared objects are mangeled so that the specified path
replaces the path of the current directory in the <br>
full pathnames appearing in the diff-header. This is useful
to replace an absolute pathname by a relative pathname and
makes the produced context-diff easier to digest for <br>
the patch program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P With the -P switch turned on,
vdiff won&rsquo;t give up if one of the two objects that
shall be compared does not exist. In this case an empty
object is substituted for the <br>
missing one, causing the diff to be the complete contents of
the existing object. This is useful in situations when
complex patches are produced that upgrade one release <br>
of a software system to a new release, and the system has
structurally changed (i.e. new files have been added to the
system).</p>
