<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
git-repack - Pack unpacked objects in a repository</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
git repack [-a] [-A] [-d] [-f] [-F] [-l] [-n] [-q]
[--window=&lt;n&gt;] [--depth=&lt;n&gt;]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This script is used to combine all objects that do not
currently reside in a &quot;pack&quot;, into a pack. It can
also be used to re-organize existing packs into a single,
more efficient <br>
pack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A pack is a collection of
objects, individually compressed, with delta compression
applied, stored in a single file, with an associated index
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Packs are used to reduce the
load on mirror systems, backup engines, disk storage,
etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-a <br>
Instead of incrementally packing the unpacked objects, pack
everything referenced into a single pack. Especially useful
when packing a repository that is used for private <br>
development. Use with -d. This will clean up the objects
that git prune leaves behind, but git fsck --full --dangling
shows as dangling.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that users fetching over
dumb protocols will have to fetch the whole new pack in
order to get any contained object, no matter how many other
objects in that pack they <br>
already have locally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A <br>
Same as -a, unless -d is used. Then any unreachable objects
in a previous pack become loose, unpacked objects, instead
of being left in the old pack. Unreachable objects are <br>
never intentionally added to a pack, even when repacking.
This option prevents unreachable objects from being
immediately deleted by way of being left in the old pack and
<br>
then removed. Instead, the loose unreachable objects will be
pruned according to normal expiry rules with the next git gc
invocation. See git-gc(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d <br>
After packing, if the newly created packs make some existing
packs redundant, remove the redundant packs. Also run git
prune-packed to remove redundant loose object files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l <br>
Pass the --local option to git pack-objects. See
git-pack-objects(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f <br>
Pass the --no-reuse-delta option to git-pack-objects, see
git-pack-objects(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F <br>
Pass the --no-reuse-object option to git-pack-objects, see
git-pack-objects(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q <br>
Pass the -q option to git pack-objects. See
git-pack-objects(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n <br>
Do not update the server information with git
update-server-info. This option skips updating local catalog
files needed to publish this repository (or a direct copy of
it) <br>
over HTTP or FTP. See git-update-server-info(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--window=&lt;n&gt;,
--depth=&lt;n&gt; <br>
These two options affect how the objects contained in the
pack are stored using delta compression. The objects are
first internally sorted by type, size and optionally names
<br>
and compared against the other objects within --window to
see if using delta compression saves space. --depth limits
the maximum delta depth; making it too deep affects the <br>
performance on the unpacker side, because delta data needs
to be applied that many times to get to the necessary
object. The default value for --window is 10 and --depth is
<br>
50.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--window-memory=&lt;n&gt; <br>
This option provides an additional limit on top of --window;
the window size will dynamically scale down so as to not
take up more than &lt;n&gt; bytes in memory. This is useful
in <br>
repositories with a mix of large and small objects to not
run out of memory with a large window, but still be able to
take advantage of the large window for the smaller <br>
objects. The size can be suffixed with &quot;k&quot;,
&quot;m&quot;, or &quot;g&quot;. --window-memory=0 makes
memory usage unlimited, which is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--max-pack-size=&lt;n&gt; <br>
Maximum size of each output pack file. The size can be
suffixed with &quot;k&quot;, &quot;m&quot;, or
&quot;g&quot;. The minimum size allowed is limited to 1 MiB.
If specified, multiple packfiles may be <br>
created. The default is unlimited, unless the config
variable pack.packSizeLimit is set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION <br>
By default, the command passes --delta-base-offset option to
git pack-objects; this typically results in slightly smaller
packs, but the generated packs are incompatible with <br>
versions of Git older than version 1.4.4. If you need to
share your repository with such ancient Git versions, either
directly or via the dumb http or rsync protocol, then you
<br>
need to set the configuration variable
repack.UseDeltaBaseOffset to &quot;false&quot; and repack.
Access from old Git versions over the native protocol is
unaffected by this option as the <br>
conversion is performed on the fly as needed in that
case.</p>
