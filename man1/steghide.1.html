<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
steghide - a steganography program</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
steghide command [ arguments ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Steghide is a steganography program that is able to hide
data in various kinds of image- and audio-files. The color-
respectivly sample-frequencies are not changed thus making
<br>
the embedding resistant against first-order statistical
tests.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Features include the compression
of the embedded data, encryption of the embedded data and
automatic integrity checking using a checksum. The JPEG,
BMP, WAV and AU file formats <br>
are supported for use as cover file. There are no
restrictions on the format of the secret data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Steghide uses a graph-theoretic
approach to steganography. You do not need to know anything
about graph theory to use steghide and you can safely skip
the rest of this paragraph <br>
if you are not interested in the technical details. The
embedding algorithm roughly works as follows: At first, the
secret data is compressed and encrypted. Then a sequence of
<br>
postions of pixels in the cover file is created based on a
pseudo-random number generator initialized with the
passphrase (the secret data will be embedded in the pixels
at these <br>
positions). Of these positions those that do not need to be
changed (because they already contain the correct value by
chance) are sorted out. Then a graph-theoretic matching <br>
algorithm finds pairs of positions such that exchanging
their values has the effect of embedding the corresponding
part of the secret data. If the algorithm cannot find any
more <br>
such pairs all exchanges are actually performed. The pixels
at the remaining positions (the positions that are not part
of such a pair) are also modified to contain the embedded
<br>
data (but this is done by overwriting them, not by
exchanging them with other pixels). The fact that (most of)
the embedding is done by exchanging pixel values implies
that the <br>
first-order statistics (i.e. the number of times a color
occurs in the picture) is not changed. For audio files the
algorithm is the same, except that audio samples are used
<br>
instead of pixels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default encryption algorithm
is Rijndael with a key size of 128 bits (which is AES - the
advanced encryption standard) in the cipher block chaining
mode. If you do not trust <br>
this combination for whatever reason feel free to choose
another algorithm/mode combination (information about all
possible algorithms and modes is displayed by the encinfo
com&acirc; <br>
mand). The checksum is calculated using the CRC32
algorithm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMANDS <br>
In this section the commands for steghide are listed. The
first argument must always be one of these commands. You can
supply additional arguments to the embed, extract and info
<br>
commands. The other commands to not take any arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">embed, --embed <br>
Embed secret data in a cover file thereby creating a stego
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">extract, --extract <br>
Extract secret data from a stego file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">info, --info <br>
Display information about a cover or stego file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">encinfo, --encinfo <br>
Display a list of encryption algorithms and modes that can
be used. No arguments required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">version, --version <br>
Display short version information. No arguments
required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">license, --license <br>
Display steghide&rsquo;s license. No arguments required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">help, --help <br>
Display a help screen. No arguments required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EMBEDDING <br>
You should use the embed command if you want to embed secret
data in a cover file. The following arguments can be used
with the embed command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ef, --embedfile filename <br>
Specify the file that will be embedded (the file that
contains the secret message). Note that steghide embeds the
original file name in the stego file. When extracting <br>
data (see below) the default behaviour is to save the
embedded file into the current directory under its original
name. If this argument is omitted or filename is -, <br>
steghide will read the secret data from standard input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-cf, --coverfile filename <br>
Specify the cover file that will be used to embed data. The
cover file must be in one of the following formats: AU, BMP,
JPEG or WAV. The file-format will be detected <br>
automatically based on header information (the extension is
not relevant). If this argument is omitted or filename is -,
steghide will read the cover file from standard <br>
input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sf, --stegofile filename <br>
Specify the name for the stego file that will be created. If
this argument is omitted when calling steghide with the
embed command, then the modifications to embed the <br>
secret data will be made directly to the cover file without
saving it under a new name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e, --encryption algo [ mode ] |
mode [ algo ] <br>
Specify encryption parameters. This option must be followed
by one or two strings that identify an encryption algorithm
and/or mode. You can get the names of all available <br>
algorithms and supported modes with the encinfo command. The
default encryption is rijndael-128 (AES) in the cbc mode. If
you do not want to use any encryption, use -e <br>
none.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z, --compress level <br>
Specify the compression level. The compression level can be
any number in 1...9 where 1 means best speed and 9 means
best compression.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Z, --dontcompress <br>
Do not compress the secret data before embedding it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-K, --nochecksum <br>
Do not embed a CRC32 checksum. You can use this if the
secret data already contains some type of checksum or if you
do not want to embed those extra 32 bits needed for the <br>
checksum.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N, --dontembedname <br>
Do not embed the file name of the secret file. If this
option is used, the extractor needs to specify a filename to
tell steghide where to write the embedded data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTRACTING <br>
If you have received a file that contains a message that has
been embedded with steghide, use the extract command to
extract it. The following arguments can be used with this
<br>
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sf, --stegofile filename <br>
Specify the stego file (the file that contains embedded
data). If this argument is omitted or filename is -,
steghide will read a stego file from standard input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-xf, --extractfile filename <br>
Create a file with the name filename and write the data that
is embedded in the stego file to it. This option overrides
the filename that is embedded int the stego file. <br>
If this argument is omitted, the embedded data will be saved
to the current directory under its original name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GETTING INFORMATION ABOUT A
COVER/STEGO FILE <br>
You can use the info command to get some information about a
cover or stego file (for example the capacity). You might
want to use this if you have received a file and you are
<br>
not sure if it contains an embedded message or if you
consider using a certain file as cover file and want to find
out its capacity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The command line steghide info
&lt;filename&gt; will print information about
&lt;filename&gt; and then ask you if you would like to get
information about data that is embedded in that file. <br>
If you answer with yes you have to supply the passphrase
that was used to embed the data in that file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also supply the -p,
--passphrase argument (see below) to the info command which
has the effect that steghide will automatically try to get
information about the data that <br>
has been embedded using the given passphrase.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMON OPTIONS <br>
The following options can be used with all commands (where
it makes sense).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, --passphrase <br>
Use the string following this argument as the passphrase. If
your passphrase contains whitespace, you have to enclose it
in quotes, for example: -p &quot;a very long <br>
passphrase&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
Display detailed information about the status of the
embedding or extracting process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q, --quiet <br>
Supress information messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, --force <br>
Always overwrite existing files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILE NAME OPTIONS <br>
All file name arguments (-cf, -ef, -sf, -xf) also accept -
as a filename which makes steghide use standard input or
standard output (whichever makes sense). Omitting the
corre&acirc; <br>
sponding file name argument will have the same effect as
using - with two exceptions: If -sf is omitted for the embed
command, then the modifications will be done directly in the
<br>
cover file. If -xf is omitted for extraction, then the
embedded data will be saved under the file name that is
embedded in the stego file. So when you want to be sure that
stan&acirc; <br>
dard input/output is used, use - as filename.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
The basic usage is as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ steghide embed -cf picture.jpg
-ef secret.txt <br>
Enter passphrase: <br>
Re-Enter passphrase: <br>
embedding &quot;secret.txt&quot; in
&quot;picture.jpg&quot;... done</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command will embed the file
secret.txt in the cover file picture.jpg.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After you have embedded your
secret data as shown above you can send the file picture.jpg
to the person who should receive the secret message. The
receiver has to use steghide in <br>
the following way:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ steghide extract -sf
picture.jpg <br>
Enter passphrase: <br>
wrote extracted data to &quot;secret.txt&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the supplied passphrase is
correct, the contents of the original file secret.txt will
be extracted from the stego file picture.jpg and saved in
the current directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you have received a file that
contains embedded data and you want to get some information
about it before extracting it, use the info command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ steghide info
received_file.wav <br>
&quot;received_file.wav&quot;: <br>
format: wave audio, PCM encoding <br>
capacity: 3.5 KB <br>
Try to get information about embedded data ? (y/n) y <br>
Enter passphrase: <br>
embedded file &quot;secret.txt&quot;: <br>
size: 1.6 KB <br>
encrypted: rijndael-128, cbc <br>
compressed: yes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After printing some general
information about the stego file (format, capacity) you will
be asked if steghide should try to get information about the
embedded data. If you answer <br>
with yes you have to supply a passphrase. Steghide will then
try to extract the embedded data with that passphrase and -
if it succeeds - print some information about it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RETURN VALUE <br>
Steghide returns 0 on success and 1 if a failure occured and
it had to terminate before completion of the requested
operation. Warnings do not have an effect on the return
value.</p>
