<p>UUPDATE(1) General Commands Manual UUPDATE(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
uupdate - upgrade a source code package from an upstream
revision</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
uupdate [options] new_upstream_archive [version] <br>
uupdate [options] --find|-f <br>
uupdate [options] --patch|-p patch_file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
uupdate modifies an existing Debian source code archive to
reflect an upstream update supplied as a patch or from a
wholly new source code archive. The utility needs to be <br>
invoked from the top directory of the old source code
directory, and if a relative name is given for the new
archive or patch file, it will be looked for first relative
to the <br>
execution directory and then relative to the parent of the
source tree. (For example, if the changelog file is
/usr/local/src/foo/foo-1.1/debian/changelog, then the
archive or <br>
patch file will be looked for relative to
/usr/local/src/foo.) Note that the patch file or archive
cannot be within the source tree itself. The full details of
what the code <br>
does are given below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Currently supported source code
file types are .tar.gz, .tar.bz2, .tar.Z, .tgz, .tar,
.tar.lzma, .tar.xz, .7z and .zip archives. Also supported
are already unpacked source code <br>
archives; simply give the path of the source code directory.
Supported patch file types are gzip-compressed,
bzip2-compressed, lzma-compressed, xz-compressed and
uncompressed <br>
patch files. The file types are identified by the file
names, so they must use the standard suffixes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Usually uupdate will be able to
deduce the version number from the source archive name (as
long as it only contains digits and periods). If that fails,
you need to specify the <br>
version number explicitly (without the Debian release number
which will always be initially &acirc;1&acirc;, or
&acirc;0ubuntu1&acirc; on Ubuntu-detected systems). This can
be done with an initial <br>
--upstream-version or -v option, or in the case of an
archive, with a version number after the filename. (The
reason for the latter is so that uupdate can be called
directly <br>
from uscan.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since uupdate uses debuild to
clean the current archive before trying to apply a patch
file, it accepts a --rootcmd or -r option allowing the user
to specify a gain-root command <br>
to be used. The default is to use fakeroot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If an archive is being built,
the pristine upstream source should be used to create the
.orig.tar.gz file wherever possible. This means that MD5
sums or other similar methods <br>
can be used to easily compare the upstream source to
Debian&rsquo;s copy of the upstream version. This is the
default behaviour, and can be switched off using the
--no-pristine option <br>
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
This is a summary of what was explained above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-conf, --noconf <br>
Do not read any configuration files. This can only be used
as the first option given on the command-line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--upstream-version version, -v
version <br>
Specify the version number of the upstream package
explicitly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--force-bad-version, -b <br>
Force a version number to be less than the current one
(e.g., when backporting).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--rootcmd gain-root-command, -r
gain-root-command <br>
Specify the command to be used to become root to build the
package and is passed onto debuild(1) if it is
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--pristine, -u <br>
Treat the source as pristine upstream source and symlink to
it from &lt;package&gt;_&lt;version&gt;.orig.tar.gz whenever
possible. This option has no meaning for patches. This is
<br>
the default behaviour.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-pristine <br>
Do not attempt to make a
&lt;package&gt;_&lt;version&gt;.orig.tar.gz symlink.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--symlink, -s <br>
Simply create a symlink when moving a new upstream .tar.gz
archive to the new
&lt;package&gt;_&lt;version&gt;.orig.tar.gz location. This
is the default behaviour.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-symlink <br>
Copy the upstream .tar.gz to the new location instead of
making a symlink, if
&lt;package&gt;_&lt;version&gt;.orig.tar.gz is missing.
Otherwise, do nothing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--find, -f <br>
Find all upstream tarballs in ../ which match
&lt;pkg&gt;_&lt;version&gt;.orig.tar.{gz|bz2|lzma|xz} or
&lt;pkg&gt;_&lt;version&gt;.orig-&lt;component&gt;.tar.{gz|bz2|lzma|xz}
; --upstream-version <br>
required; pristine source required; not valid for --patch;
This option uses dpkg-source as the backend to enable
support for the multiple upstream tarballs and to resolve
<br>
minor bugs reported previously. The use of this option is
highly recommended.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--verbose <br>
Give verbose output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help, -h <br>
Display a help message and exit successfully.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Display version and copyright information and exit
successfully.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION VARIABLES <br>
The two configuration files /etc/devscripts.conf and
~/.devscripts are sourced in that order to set configuration
variables. Command line options can be used to override
config&acirc; <br>
uration file settings. Environment variable settings are
ignored for this purpose. The currently recognised variables
are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UUPDATE_PRISTINE <br>
If this is set to no, then it is the same as the
--no-pristine command line parameter being used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UUPDATE_SYMLINK_ORIG <br>
If this is set to no, then it is the same as the
--no-symlink command line parameter being used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UUPDATE_ROOTCMD <br>
This is equivalent to the --rootcmd option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ACTIONS TAKEN ON AN ARCHIVE <br>
Figure out new version number <br>
Unless an explicit version number is provided, the archive
name is analyzed for a sequence of digits separated by dots.
If something like that is found, it is taken to be <br>
the new upstream version number. If not, processing is
aborted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Create the .orig.tar.gz archive
<br>
If the --pristine or -u option is specified and the upstream
archive is a .tar.gz or .tgz archive, then this will be
copied directly to
&lt;package&gt;_&lt;version&gt;.orig.tar.gz.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unpacking <br>
The archive is unpacked and placed in a directory with the
correct name according to Debian policy:
package-upstream_version.orig. Processing is aborted if this
directory <br>
already exists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Patching <br>
The .diffs.gz from the current version are applied to the
unpackaged archive. A non-zero exit status and warning
message will occur if the patches did not apply cleanly <br>
or if no patch file was found. Also, the list of rejected
patches will be shown. The file debian/rules is made
executable and all of the .orig files created by patch are
<br>
deleted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Changelog update <br>
A changelog entry with the new version number is generated
with the text &acirc;New upstream release&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When used on Ubuntu systems,
dpkg-vendor detection is used to set the Debian revision to
&acirc;0ubuntu1&acirc;. You may change debian/changelog
manually afterwards.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ACTIONS TAKEN ON A PATCH FILE
<br>
Figure out new version number <br>
Unless an explicit version number is provided, the patch
file name is analyzed for a sequence of digits separated by
dots. If something like that is found, it is taken to <br>
be the new upstream version number. If not, processing is
aborted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Clean the current source tree
<br>
The command debuild clean is executed within the current
Debian source archive to clean it. If a -r option is given
to uupdate, it is passed on to debuild.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Patching <br>
The current source archive (.orig.tar.gz) is unpacked and
the patch applied to the original sources. If this is
successful, then the .orig directory is renamed to reflect
<br>
the new version number and the current Debian source
directory is copied to a directory with the new version
number, otherwise processing is aborted. The patch is then
<br>
applied to the new copy of the Debian source directory. The
file debian/rules is made executable and all of the .orig
files created by patch are deleted. If there was a <br>
problem with the patching, a warning is issued and the
program will eventually exit with non-zero exit status.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Changelog update <br>
A changelog entry with the new version number is generated
with the text &acirc;New upstream release&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When used on Ubuntu systems,
dpkg-vendor detection is used to set the Debian revision to
&acirc;0ubuntu1&acirc;. You may change debian/changelog
manually afterwards.</p>
