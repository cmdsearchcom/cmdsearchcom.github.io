<p>TEX(1) General Commands Manual TEX(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
tex, virtex, initex - text formatting and typesetting</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
tex [options] [&amp;format] [file| DESCRIPTION <br>
Run the TeX typesetter on file, usually creating file.dvi.
If the file argument has no extension, &quot;.tex&quot; will
be appended to it. Instead of a filename, a set of TeX
commands <br>
can be given, the first of which must start with a
backslash. With a &amp;format argument TeX uses a different
set of precompiled commands, contained in format.fmt; it is
usually <br>
better to use the -fmt format option instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TeX formats the interspersed
text and commands contained in the named files and outputs a
typesetter independent file (called DVI, which is short for
DeVice Independent). TeX&rsquo;s <br>
capabilities and language are described in The TeX for
nroffbook. TeX is normally used with a large body of
precompiled macros, and there are several specific
formatting sys&acirc; <br>
tems, such as LaTeX, which require the support of several
macro files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This version of TeX looks at its
command line to see what name it was called under. If they
exist, then both initex and virtex are symbolic links to the
tex executable. When <br>
called as initex (or when the -ini option is given) it can
be used to precompile macros into a .fmt file. When called
as virtex it will use the plain format. When called under
<br>
any other name, TeX will use that name as the name of the
format to use. For example, when called as tex the tex
format is used, which is identical to the plain format. The
<br>
commands defined by the plain format are documented in The
TeX for nroffbook. Other formats that are often available
include latex and amstex.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The non-option command line
arguments to the TeX program are passed to it as the first
input line. (But it is often easier to type extended
arguments as the first input line, <br>
since UNIX shells tend to gobble up or misinterpret
TeX&rsquo;s favorite symbols, like backslashes, unless you
quote them.) As described in The TeX for nroffbook, that
first line <br>
should begin with a filename, a <br>
The normal usage is to say <br>
tex paper <br>
to start processing paper.tex. The name paper will be the
&lsquo;&lsquo;jobname&rsquo;&rsquo;, and is used in forming
output filenames. If TeX doesn&rsquo;t get a filename in the
first line, the jobname is <br>
texput. When looking for a file, TeX looks for the name with
and without the default extension (.tex) appended, unless
the name already contains that extension. If paper is the
<br>
&lsquo;&lsquo;jobname&rsquo;&rsquo;, a log of error
messages, with rather more detail than normally appears on
the screen, will appear in paper.log, and the output file
will be in paper.dvi.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This version of TeX can look in
the first line of the file paper.tex to see if it begins
with the magic sequence %&amp;. If the first line begins
with %&amp;format -translate-file tcx&acirc; <br>
name then TeX will use the named format and translation
table tcxname to process the source file. Either the format
name or the -translate-file specification may be omitted,
but <br>
not both. This overrides the format selection based on the
name by which the program is invoked. The -parse-first-line
option or the parse_first_line configuration variable <br>
controls whether this behaviour is enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The e response to TeX&rsquo;s
error prompt causes the system default editor to start up at
the current line of the current file. The environment
variable TEXEDIT can be used to change <br>
the editor used. It may contain a string with &quot;%s&quot;
indicating where the filename goes and &quot;%d&quot;
indicating where the decimal line number (if any) goes. For
example, a TEXEDIT <br>
string for emacs can be set with the sh command <br>
TEXEDIT=&quot;emacs +%d %s&quot;; export TEXEDIT</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A convenient file in the library
is null.tex, containing nothing. When TeX can&rsquo;t find a
file it thinks you want to input, it keeps asking you for
another filename; responding <br>
&lsquo;null&rsquo; gets you out of the loop if you
don&rsquo;t want to input anything. You can also type your
EOF character (usually control-D).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
This version of TeX understands the following command line
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-enc Enable the encTeX
extensions. This option is only effective in combination
with -ini. For documentation of the encTeX extensions see
http://www.olsak.net/enctex.html.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-file-line-error <br>
Print error messages in the form file:line:error which is
similar to the way many compilers format them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-no-file-line-error <br>
Disable printing error messages in the file:line:error
style.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-file-line-error-style <br>
This is the old name of the -file-line-error option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fmt format <br>
Use format as the name of the format to be used, instead of
the name by which TeX was called or a %&amp; line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-halt-on-error <br>
Exit with an error code when an error is encountered during
processing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-help Print help message and
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ini Start in INI mode, which is
used to dump formats. The INI mode can be used for
typesetting, but no format is preloaded, and basic
initializations like setting catcodes <br>
may be required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-interaction mode <br>
Sets the interaction mode. The mode can be either batchmode,
nonstopmode, scrollmode, and errorstopmode. The meaning of
these modes is the same as that of the corre&acirc; <br>
sponding <br>
-ipc Send DVI output to a socket as well as the usual output
file. Whether this option is available is the choice of the
installer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ipc-start <br>
As -ipc, and starts the server at the other end as well.
Whether this option is available is the choice of the
installer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-jobname name <br>
Use name for the job name, instead of deriving it from the
name of the input file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-kpathsea-debug bitmask <br>
Sets path searching debugging flags according to the
bitmask. See the Kpathsea manual for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mktex fmt <br>
Enable mktexfmt, where fmt must be either tex or tfm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mltex Enable MLTeX extensions.
Only effective in combination with -ini.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-no-mktex fmt <br>
Disable mktexfmt, where fmt must be either tex or tfm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-output-comment string <br>
Use string for the DVI file comment instead of the date.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-output-directory directory <br>
Write output files in directory instead of the current
directory. Look up input files in directory first, then
along the normal search path. See also description of the
<br>
TEXMFOUTPUT environment variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-parse-first-line <br>
If the first line of the main input file begins with %&amp;
parse it to look for a dump name or a -translate-file
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-no-parse-first-line <br>
Disable parsing of the first line of the main input
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-progname name <br>
Pretend to be program name. This affects both the format
used and the search paths.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-recorder <br>
Enable the filename recorder. This leaves a trace of the
files opened for input and output in a file with extension
.fls.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-shell-escape <br>
Enable the 480uct. The command can be any shell command.
This construct is normally disallowed for security
reasons.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-no-shell-escape <br>
Disable the 480uct, even if it is enabled in the texmf.cnf
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-src-specials <br>
Insert source specials into the DVI file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-src-specials where <br>
Insert source specials in certain places of the DVI file.
where is a comma-separated value list: cr, display, hbox,
math, par, parent, or vbox.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-translate-file tcxname <br>
Use the tcxname translation table to set the mapping of
input characters and re-mapping of output characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-default-translate-file tcxname
<br>
Like -translate-file except that a %&amp; line can overrule
this setting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-version <br>
Print version information and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
See the Kpathsearch library documentation (the &lsquo;Path
specifications&rsquo; node) for precise details of how the
environment variables are used. The kpsewhich utility can be
used to <br>
query the values of the variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One caveat: In most TeX formats,
you cannot use ~ in a filename you give directly to TeX,
because ~ is an active character, and hence is expanded, not
taken as part of the file&acirc; <br>
name. Other programs, such as Metafont, do not have this
problem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TEXMFOUTPUT <br>
Normally, TeX puts its output files in the current
directory. If any output file cannot be opened there, it
tries to open it in the directory specified in the
environment <br>
variable TEXMFOUTPUT. There is no default value for that
variable. For example, if you say tex paper and the current
directory is not writable, if TEXMFOUTPUT has the <br>
value /tmp, TeX attempts to create /tmp/paper.log (and
/tmp/paper.dvi, if any output is produced.) TEXMFOUTPUT is
also checked for input files, as TeX often generates <br>
files that need to be subsequently read; for input, no
suffixes (such as &lsquo;&lsquo;.tex&rsquo;&rsquo;) are
added by default, the input name is simply checked as
given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TEXINPUTS <br>
Search path for input and srobably start with
&lsquo;&lsquo;.&rsquo;&rsquo;, so that user files are found
before system files. An empty path component will be
replaced with <br>
the paths defined in the texmf.cnf file. For example, set
TEXINPUTS to &quot;.:/home/user/tex:&quot; to prepend the
current directory and
&lsquo;&lsquo;/home/user/tex&rsquo;&rsquo; to the standard
search <br>
path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TEXFORMATS <br>
Search path for format files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TEXPOOL <br>
search path for tex internal strings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TEXEDIT <br>
Command template for switching to editor. The default,
usually vi, is set when TeX is compiled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TFMFONTS <br>
Search path for font metric (.tfm) files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
The location of the files mentioned below varies from system
to system. Use the kpsewhich utility to find their
locations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">texmf.cnf <br>
Configuration file. This contains definitions of search
paths as well as other configuration parameters like
parse_first_line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tex.pool <br>
Text file containing TeX&rsquo;s internal strings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">texfonts.map <br>
Filename mapping definitions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*.tfm Metric files for
TeX&rsquo;s fonts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*.fmt Predigested TeX format
(.fmt) files.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">$TEXMFMAIN/tex/plain/base/plain.tex
<br>
The basic macro package described in the TeX for
nroffbook.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
This manual page is not meant to be exhaustive. The complete
documentation for this version of TeX can be found in the
info manual Web2C: A TeX implementation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
This version of TeX implements a number of optional
extensions. In fact, many of these extensions conflict to a
greater or lesser extent with the definition of TeX. When
such <br>
extensions are enabled, the banner printed when TeX starts
is changed to print TeXk instead of TeX.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This version of TeX fails to
trap arithmetic overflow when dimensions are added or
subtracted. Cases where this occurs are rare, but when it
does the generated DVI file will be <br>
invalid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TRIVIA <br>
TeX, pronounced properly, rhymes with
&lsquo;&lsquo;blecchhh.&rsquo;&rsquo; The proper spelling in
typewriter-like fonts is &lsquo;&lsquo;TeX&rsquo;&rsquo; and
not &lsquo;&lsquo;TEX&rsquo;&rsquo; or
&lsquo;&lsquo;tex.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHORS <br>
TeX was designed by Donald E. Knuth, who implemented it
using his Web system for Pascal programs. It was ported to
Unix at Stanford by Howard Trickey, and at Cornell by Pavel
<br>
Curtis. The version now offered with the Unix TeX
distribution is that generated by the Web to C system
(web2c), originally written by Tomas Rokicki and Tim
Morgan.</p>
