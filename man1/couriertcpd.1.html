<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
couriertcpd - the Courier mail server TCP server daemon</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
couriertcpd [-pid=pidfile] [option...] {list} {program}
{arg...}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">couriertcpd {-pid=pidfile}
{-stop}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">couriertcpd {-pid=pidfile}
{-restart}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
couriertcpd accepts incoming network connections, and runs
program after establishing each network connection. The
program&rsquo;s standard input and output are set to the
network <br>
connection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list is a comma-separated list
of TCP port numbers where incoming connections are created.
program is the program to run. If program requires any
arguments, they are specified <br>
on the command line, after program itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Before running program,
couriertcpd initializes several environment variables that
describe the network connection. The environment inherited
by program will be the environment <br>
inherited by couriertcpd, plus any additional environment
variables initialized by couriertcpd. It is also possible to
reject certain network connections. Several options are <br>
available to specify which network connections will be
rejected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-access=filename <br>
Specifies an optional access file. The access file lists the
IP addresses from which connections should be accepted or
rejected. The access file is also used to initialize <br>
environment variables based on the IP address of the
connection. filename is a GDBM or DB database file
that&rsquo;s usually created by a script from one or more
text files. See <br>
&quot;ACCESS FILE&quot; below for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-accesslocal <br>
Lookup the local interface IP and port in the access file,
in addition to looking up the remote IP. This gives a
mechanism for setting environment variables depending on
<br>
which IP address and/or port the client connected to. In the
access file, &quot;1.2.3.4.25&quot; matches connections to
IP address 1.2.3.4 port 25; &quot;1.2.3.4&quot; matches
connections to IP <br>
address 1.2.3.4 on any port; and &quot;*.25&quot; matches
connections to port 25 on any IP address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-address=n.n.n.n <br>
Accept network connections only to IP address n.n.n.n. If
not specified, couriertcpd accepts connections to any IP
address that the system accepts connections on. If the <br>
system has multiple network interfaces with separate IP
addresses, this option makes couriertcpd accept connections
only to one specific IP address. Most systems have <br>
multiple network interfaces: the loopback interface, plus
the local network interface, so that -address=127.0.0.1
accepts connections only from the local system. When <br>
multiple port numbers are specified, it is also possible to
selectively bind different network addresses to each port
number when list specifies more than one port number. <br>
See &quot;Multiple port list[1]&quot; below for more
information.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-block=zone[,var[/n.n.n.n][,msg]]
or -allow=zone[,var[/n.n.n.n[,]]] <br>
Initialize the environment variable var if both of the
following conditions are true: var is not already
initialized; the connecting IP address can be found in a
DNS-based <br>
access list. See DNS ACCESS LISTS, below. Multiple -block
and -allow options can be specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-block and -allow are very
similar, differing only in minor semantics. -block&rsquo;s
semantics are more appropriate for using DNS access list to
block access, and -allow&rsquo;s <br>
semantics are more appropriate for using DNS access list to
whitelist IP addresses and exempt them even if they appear
in other -blocked zones.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-denymsg=text <br>
Specifies an optional message to be returned to the client
if the -access option rejects them. The default is to drop
the TCP connection without sending back any messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-drop=var <br>
If the environment variable var is set to a nonempty value,
terminate immediately. Do not run the program to handle the
connection. See DNS ACCESS LISTS, below, for more <br>
information. var defaults to &acirc;BLOCK&acirc;, if not
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-group=group <br>
Set couriertcpd&rsquo;s its group ID. group may be specified
numerically, or by its name. Only the superuser may use
-group.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-listen=n <br>
Length of the queue which holds pending connections. n is a
number. If not specified, the system default is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-maxperc=n <br>
Maximum number of connections accepted from the same C
network block. Using this option is recommended, because
connection slots are limited. Without this option, the same
C <br>
network block can potentially use up all available
connection slots.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-maxperip=n <br>
Maximum number of connections accepted from the same IP
address. Use both the -maxperc and -maxperip options to fine
tune connection limits. For example, when couriertcpd is
<br>
listening on the SMTP port it makes sense to set an upper
limit on the number of connections from the same C block.
Domains that send a large amount of mail often have <br>
multiple servers sending outbound mail from the same C
block, so it makes sense to set limits on individual C
blocks. On the other hand, if couriertcpd is listening on
the <br>
POP3 port it makes more sense to set limits on individual IP
addresses. If a C block of addresses is assigned to a dialup
modem pool, it is certainly possible to have many IP <br>
addresses within the same C block have connections to the
POP3 server at the same time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -maxperip option can be
overridden for a given IP address by setting the MAXCPERIP
environment variable, see &acirc;Setting environment
variables&acirc; for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-maxprocs=n <br>
Maximum number of connection slots, or the maximum number of
processes started. This effectively specifies the maximum
number of connections accepted at the same time. After <br>
the maximum number of connections has been opened,
couriertcpd waits for an existing connection to close,
before accepting any more connections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-warn=n <br>
Log a LOG_WARNING message to syslog when the number of
active processes exceeds n. The default is 90% of maxprocs.
couriertcpd logs a LOG_ALERT syslog message when the <br>
number of active processes reaches the maximum.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nodnslookup <br>
Do not look up the hostname associated with connecting IP
address and the local addres, do not initialize the
TCPREMOTEHOST or TCPLOCALHOST environment variables (see
below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-noidentlookup <br>
Do not perform an ident lookup, and do not initialize the
TCPREMOTEINFO environment variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pid=filename <br>
If given, couriertcpd puts itself into the background and
saves its process ID in this file, usually somewhere in
/var/run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option must also be present
when using the -restart and -stop options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-restart <br>
Send a SIGHUP to an existing couriertcpd process. Specify
the same -pid argument as the one that was used to start
couriertcpd. The process ID is read from the -pid file, and
<br>
the couriertcpd receives a SIGHUP signal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-stderr=socket <br>
Set program&rsquo;s standard error to the network
connection, just like its standard input and output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-stderr=logfile <br>
Set program&rsquo;s standard error to the specified file,
logfile. The file is created, if necessary, and is opened in
append mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-stderrlogger=logprogram <br>
Set program&rsquo;s standard error to a pipe, which is read
by logprogram. Only one instance of logger is started, which
receives standard error from every instance of program. The
<br>
specified logger is executed with the output end of the
stderr pipe connected as standard input. logprogram is
executed with one argument - program&rsquo;s name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-stderrloggername=name <br>
Use name as the argument to logprogram, instead of the
program&rsquo;s name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-stop <br>
Stop (kill) an existing couriertcpd process. Specify the
same -pid argument as the one that was used to start
couriertcpd. The process ID is read from the -pid file, and
the <br>
couriertcpd process is killed. All child processes of
couriertcpd will receive a SIGTERM signal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-user=user <br>
Set couriertcpd&rsquo;s user ID. Also, the group ID is set
to the user&rsquo;s group ID. Using both -group and -user is
not necessary. Only the superuser can specify -user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MULTIPLE PORT LIST <br>
The list argument can be a comma-separated list of multiple
port numbers. couriertcpd will create network connections on
any listed port. Each port number can be optionally <br>
specified as &quot;address.port&quot;, for example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">couriertcpd
-pid=/var/run/smtp.pid 127.0.0.1.25,999 program</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This instance accepts network
connections to either port 25 or port 999, however
connections on port 25 are created only on the IP address
127.0.0.1, the loopback interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Whenever an IP address is not
specified, network connections are accepted to any IP
address (called &quot;wildcarding&quot;). On IPv6-capable
systems, couriertcpd will attempt to create <br>
two incoming network connection ports, if an IP address is
not specified. After creating the first port as an IPv6
wildcard port, couriertcpd will then attept to create an
IPv4 <br>
wildcard port, with the same port number. Some BSD-derived
systems must use separate IPv6 and IPv4 wildcard ports to
create incoming network connections. Most other systems only
<br>
need an IPv6 port to create both IPv6 and IPv4 incoming
network connections. couriertcpd quietly ignores a failure
to create an IPv4 wildcard port, as long as an IPv6 wildcard
<br>
was succesfully created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -address option can be used
to default a specific IP address for every listed port
number. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">couriertcpd
-pid=/var/run/smtp.pid 127.0.0.1.25,127.0.0.1.999
program</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">couriertcpd
-pid=/var/run/smtp.pid -address=127.0.0.1 25,999 program</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will create network connections
on ports 25 and 999 of the IP address 127.0.0.1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ACCESS FILE <br>
The access file lists IP addresses that couriertcpd will
accept or reject connections from. An access file is
optional. Without an access file couriertcpd accepts a
connection <br>
from any IP address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses can
be specified, if IPv6 support is available. A non-standard
syntax is currently used to specify IPv6 addresses. This is
subject to change in the <br>
near future. IPv6 support is currently considered to be
experimental.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The access file is a binary
database file that&rsquo;s usually created by a script, such
as makesmtpaccess(8)[2], or makeimapaccess(8)[3], from one
or more plain text files. Blank <br>
lines in the text file are ignored. Lines that start with
the # character are also ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Rejecting and accepting
connections by IP address <br>
The following line instructs couriertcpd to reject all
connections from an IP address range:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">netblock&lt;tab&gt;deny</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">netblock is an IP address, such
as 192.68.0.2. &lt;tab&gt; is the ASCII tab character. There
MUST be exactly one tab character after the IP address and
the word &quot;deny&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also block connections
from an entire network C block:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">192.68.0&lt;tab&gt;deny</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This blocks connections from IP
addresses 192.68.0.0 through 192.68.0.255. Blocking
connections from an entire B or A network block works the
same way.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use the word &quot;allow&quot;
instead of &quot;deny&quot; to explicitly allow connections
from that IP address or netblock. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">192.68.0&lt;tab&gt;deny <br>
192.68.0.10&lt;tab&gt;allow</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This blocks all connections from
192.68.0.0 to 192.68.0.255 except for 192.68.0.10. These two
lines can occur in any order. couriertcpd always uses the
line with the most <br>
specific IP address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the IP address of the
connection is not found in the access file the connection is
accepted by default. The following line causes unlisted
connections to be rejected:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*&lt;tab&gt;deny</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IPv6 addresses <br>
Note <br>
IPv6 support in the access file is experimental, and is
subject to change in a future release. The following syntax
is subject to change at any time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The access file can also specify
IPv6 addresses, if IPv6 support is available. The existing
IPv4 address format is used for IPv6-mapped IPv4 addresses,
and no changes are <br>
required. For all other IPv6 addresses use the following
format:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">:hhhh:hhhh:hhhh:hhhh:hhhh:hhhh:hhhh:hhhh&lt;tab&gt;action</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The IPv6 address must begin with
:. The initial : character is not really a part of the IPv6
address, it is only used to designate this record as an IPv6
address, allowing an <br>
access file to contain a mixture of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
The IPv6 address follows the initial : character, and it
must be spelled out using zero-padded lowercase hexadecimal
<br>
digits. For example:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:f643:00a2:9354&lt;tab&gt;deny</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Netblocks must be specified
using even-word boundaries only:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">:3ffe&lt;tab&gt;deny</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This will deny entire 3ffe::/16
(6bone network, which is phased out).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">:2002:c0a8&lt;tab&gt;deny</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This will deny 2002:c0a8::/32
(6to4 addresses derived from private address space).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Setting environment variables
<br>
allow can be optionally followed by a list of environment
variable assignments, separated by commas. The environment
variables are set before executing program or checking
access <br>
lists (see below). For example:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">192.68.0&lt;tab&gt;allow,RELAYCLIENT
<br>

192.68.0.10&lt;tab&gt;allow,RELAYCLIENT,SIZELIMIT=1000000</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This sets RELAYCLIENT
environment variable for connections from the 192.68.0
block. In addition to that, the SIZELIMIT environment
variable is set to 1000000 if the connection <br>
comes from the IP address 192.68.0.10.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that RELAYCLIENT must be
explicitly specified for the IP address 192.68.0.10. The
first line is NOT used for connections from this IP address.
couriertcpd only reads one <br>
entry from the access file, the entry for the most specific
IP address.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">192.68.0.10&lt;tab&gt;allow,MAXCPERIP=100</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">couriertcpd itself implements
the MAXCPERIP environment variable setting in the access
file, as an override to the -maxperip parameter, which
specifies the maximum number of <br>
connections from the same IP address. If specified in the
access file for an IP address, or an IP address range, the
value given by MAXCPERIP overrides it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DNS ACCESS LISTS <br>
An alternative to listing banned IP addresses in access
files is to use an external DNS-based IP access list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is no provision to support
IPv6-based lists, because none yet exist. IPv6-based access
list support will be added in the future.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">couriertcpd&rsquo;s default
configuration does not automatically reject connections from
banned IP address unless the -drop option is present.
Instead, couriertcpd sets an environment <br>
variable if the connecting address has a hit in the DNS
access list. The Courier mail server rejects all mail if the
connection&rsquo;s environment has the environment variable
BLOCK <br>
set to a non-empty string, and it just so happens that
-block and -allow set the BLOCK environment variable by
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-allow=dnswl.example.com
-block=dnsbl.example.com</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-allow and -block&rsquo;s
parameter gives the DNS zone where the access list query
gets performed. In this example, couriertcpd makes a DNS
query for &acirc;d.c.b.a.dnswl.example.com&acirc;, then,
<br>
if necessary, for &acirc;d.c.b.a.dnsbl.example.com&acirc;,
for a connection from the IP address a.b.c.d.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the DNS query succeeds (more
details below), -allow sets the environment variable to an
empty string, and -block sets the environment variable from
the TXT record in the DNS <br>
response, or to &acirc;Access denied.&acirc; if the DNS
access list did not return a TXT record. It should be
possible to use couriertcpd with DNS access lists that use
either A or TXT <br>
records.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The DNS zone parameter to -allow
and -block has up to three additional components, which must
be given in the following order, if more than one optional
component gets specified:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-allow=dnswl.example.com,BLOCK2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The environment variable that
gets set by the DNS access list query can be changed from
the default of BLOCK to something else, BLOCK2 in this
example. The Courier mail server <br>
pays attention only to BLOCK, this is for the benefit of
local or custom hacks, which want to leverage
couriertcpd&rsquo;s DNS access list lookup facilities, but
want it for other <br>
purposes.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-block=dnsbl.example.com/127.0.0.2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">couriertcpd&rsquo;s DNS access
list lookup normally ignores the contents of the actual A
record in the DNS access list, however some DNS access lists
may use different A record to <br>
indicate different kinds of records. Given an explicit IP
address to couriertcpd results in the environment variable
getting set only if the lookup returned the matching A <br>
record. An A record must exist in the DNS access list, in
addition to any TXT record. If an explicit IP address is not
given, any A or TXT record sets -allow and -block&rsquo;s
<br>
environment variable.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-block=dnsbl.example.com,BLOCK,Go
away</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The last component specifies a
custom message that overrides any TXT record in the DNS
access list. Note that this is a single parameter to
couriertcpd, so the parameter must be <br>
quoted if it contains any spaces or special shell
metacharacters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The custom message parameter
gets specified for the -block, option. -allow also allows
takes this parameter, but it has a different meaning. If its
set, even if it&rsquo;s an empty <br>
string, couriertcpd looks for TXT records in the DNS access
list that&rsquo;s used as a whitelist, in addition to the A
records (using the &acirc;any&acirc; query):</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-allow=dnswl.example.com,BLOCK,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Without this parameter
couriertcpd queries for A records only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, a literal IP address,
if given, must always follow the variable name:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-block=dnsbl.example.com,BLOCK/127.0.0.2,Go
away</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-block normally searches the DNS
access list for either A or TXT records using the
&acirc;any&acirc; DNS query. Sometimes this can cause
problems, or not work at all, with older DNS servers. <br>
Specifying a custom message results in -block executing an
ordinary A DNS query. -allow always uses an A query.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MULTIPLE DNS LISTS <br>
Multiple -block and -allow options can be given. The
connecting IP address gets looked up in multiple access
lists. This is implemented as follows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">couriertcpd processes all -block
and -allow options in list order. If each option&rsquo;s
environment variable (BLOCK or something else) is already
set, couriertcpd skips the DNS <br>
access list lookup. Therefore, when multiple options use the
same environment variable, the first DNS access list it
exists in will set the environment variable, and the <br>
remaining ones get ignored, but any remaining -blocks and
-allows for different environment variables still get
processed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It follows that, in general,
-allow options should always be listed first, before any
-blocks; but it&rsquo;s also possible to implement a
complicated policy with some -allows, then <br>
some -blocks, then more -allows and -blocks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ADDITIONAL DNS ACCESS LIST
VARIABLES <br>
Three additional environment variables may get set in
conjunction with a successful DNS access list lookup:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BLOCK_IP</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The contents of the A record in
the DNS access list, if one exists (this is not set for DNS
access lists that use TXT record).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BLOCK_TXT</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The contents of the TXT record
in the DNS access list, if one exists. This will generally
be the same as BLOCK for -blocks, but will also provide the
contents of the TXT <br>
record for -allows (if it has a dummy custom message
portion) which always set BLOCK to an empty string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BLOCK_ZONE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The DNS zone of the succesfull
access list lookup, like
&acirc;dnsbl.example.com&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-block and -allow options that
specify a custom environment variable name follow the same
naming convention, of appending &acirc;_IP&acirc;,
&acirc;_TXT&acirc;, and &acirc;_ZONE&acirc; suffix to the
name of the <br>
custom environment variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USING DNS WHITELISTS WITH SPF
<br>
Including &acirc;allowok&acirc; keyword in an SPF setting
automatically passes the SPF check for senders whose IP
address is found in an -allow-ed access list. See
courier(8)[4].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
couriertcpd also initializes the following environment
variables prior to running program:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TCPLOCALHOST <br>
The name of the host on the local end of the network
connection, looked up in DNS. TCPLOCALHOST will not be set
if the IP address of the network connection&rsquo;s local
end <br>
cannot be found in DNS, or if -nodnslookup option is
specified. TCPLOCALHOST will be set to the string softdnserr
if the DNS lookup fails with a temporary error (so you <br>
cannot tell if the IP address has a valid host name
associated with it), or if the reverse and forward DNS
lookups do not match. TCPLOCALHOST will not be set if the
reverse <br>
DNS lookup fails completely.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TCPLOCALIP <br>
The IP address of the local end of the network
connection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TCPLOCALPORT <br>
Rhe number of the port of the local end of the network
connection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TCPREMOTEHOST <br>
The hostname of the connecting host. Like TCPLOCALHOST, but
for the connecting IP address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TCPREMOTEIP <br>
Connecting IP address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TCPREMOTEINFO <br>
Identification string received from the IDENT server on the
remote IP address. Not set if the IDENT server returned an
error, or if the -noidentlookup option was specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TCPREMOTEPORT <br>
TCP port of the remote end of the network connection.</p>
