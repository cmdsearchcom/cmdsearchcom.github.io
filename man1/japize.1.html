<p>JAPIZE(1) General Commands Manual JAPIZE(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
japize - Produce a listing of an API in a machine-readable
format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
japize [unzip] [as &lt;name&gt;] apis
&lt;zipfile&gt;|&lt;dir&gt; ... +|-&lt;pkgpath&gt; ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
japize is part of japitools, designed to test for
compatibility between Java APIs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">They were originally designed
for testing free implementations of Java itself for
compatibility with Sun&rsquo;s JDK, but they can also be
used for testing backward compatibility <br>
between versions of any API.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The tools are japize and
japicompat. Japize is a Java program which emits a listing
of an API in a machine-readable format. Japicompat then
takes two such listings and compares <br>
them for binary compatibility, as defined by Sun in the Java
Language Specification.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At least one +&lt;pkgpath&gt; is
required. &lt;name&gt; will have &quot;.japi&quot; and/or
&quot;.gz&quot; appended as appropriate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The word &quot;apis&quot; can be
replaced by &quot;explicitly&quot;, &quot;byname&quot;,
&quot;packages&quot; or &quot;classes&quot;. These options
indicate whether something of the form &quot;a.b.C&quot;
should be treated as a class or a <br>
package. You may specify this unambiguously by using one of
the forms &quot;a.b.cpackage,&quot; or
&quot;a.b,CClass&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
unzip disable zipping of the output with gzip. Zipping the
output is highly recommended since it saves huge amounts of
space. The only situations where you might not want to use
<br>
gzip compression are when memory and CPU usage are extremely
tight or if your JVM does not implement GZIPOutputStream
correctly (in which case you might still want to gzip <br>
the resulting file manually).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">as &lt;name&gt; <br>
Specifying this option tells japize to write its output to a
file with the specified name. When writing to a file with
the &quot;as&quot; option, japize insists on writing to a
file <br>
name ending in .japi.gz for compressed files, or .japi for
uncompressed files. If the filename you specify
doesn&rsquo;t have the right extension, japize will add
parts to it to <br>
ensure that it does.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the &quot;as&quot; option is
omitted, japize will write to standard output. In this case
japize has no control over the filename you use, but it is
strongly recommended to use a <br>
filename with the correct extension (&quot;.japi.gz&quot;
unless the &quot;unzip&quot; option was specified). If you
use any other extension, japicompat and other tools may be
unable to rec&acirc; <br>
ognize the format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">apis | explicitly | byname |
packages | classes <br>
This option has a dual role: it indicates the boundary
between japize options (unzip, as) and other arguments
(files and packages), but also tells japize how to deal with
<br>
ambiguously specified arguments. See
&quot;+|-&lt;pkgpath&gt;&quot; below for details on the
behavior of each option. If you are unsure which to specify,
&quot;apis&quot; is a safe choice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">apis <br>
a.b.c is tried both as a package and a class. This will
always do what you want (which is why apis is described as
the safe default) but at the expense of possibly doing <br>
extra unnecessary processing trying to find the wrong
thing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">explicitly <br>
pkgpaths of the form a.b.c are illegal - you must use the
explicit form.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">byname <br>
a.b.c will be processed as a package if &quot;c&quot; starts
with a lowercase letter, or as a class if it starts with an
uppercase one. This usually does what you want but fails on
<br>
things like org.omg.CORBA.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">packages <br>
a.b.c will be processed as a package. If processing for a
class is needed, it must be specified explicitly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">classes <br>
a.b.c will be processed as a class. If processing for a
package is needed, it must be specified explicitly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;zipfile&gt; | &lt;dir&gt;
<br>
Any arguments after &quot;apis&quot; that do not start with
&quot;+&quot; or &quot;-&quot; are taken to be zipfiles or
directories. These should be specified exactly as you would
put them in your <br>
CLASSPATH (except separated by spaces rather than colons).
Anything that&rsquo;s a file will be assumed to be a zip (or
jar) file, so you can&rsquo;t specify a .class file directly
- <br>
if you need to do that you should specify the folder
containing it and then name the class for processing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+|-&lt;pkgpath&gt; <br>
To specify which classes are included, use +pkgpath to add
pkgpaths to be scanned and -pkgpath to exclude sub-pkgpaths
of these. You MUST specify at least one +pkgpath <br>
option to specify which pkgpath to include, otherwise Japize
could happily scan through all the zipfiles and directories
but not actually process any of the classes. Since <br>
that would be a useless thing to do, japize gives an error
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A &quot;pkgpath&quot; refers to
either a package (which includes, by implication, all
sub-packages of it) or a single class. A pkgpath for a
package looks like &quot;com.foo.pkg.sub,&quot; <br>
and a pkgpath for a class looks like
&quot;com.foo.pkg,Cls&quot;. The existence and placement of
the comma indicates unambiguously which type of path is
intended.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most of the time, though,
it&rsquo;s a pain to have to put in commas in names that are
familiar with dots instead, and get the comma placement
exactly right. For this reason, <br>
japize accepts pkgpaths containing only dots, and lets you
tell it what to make of those names. The interpretation of
&quot;a.b.c&quot; as a pkgpath depends on whether you
specified <br>
apis, explicitly, byname, packages, or classes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLE <br>
Sun&rsquo;s JDK 1.1 includes classes in java.awt.peer and in
java.text.resources that are not part of the public API,
even though they are public classes; however, every other
class in <br>
the java.* package hierarchy is part of the public API. The
syntax to construct a useful jdk11.japi.gz would therefore
be:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ japize as jdk11 apis
classes.zip +java -java.awt.peer -java.text.resources</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that since all pkgpath
arguments here are packages, you could save a small amount
of processing by doing this instead:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ japize as jdk11 packages
classes.zip +java -java.awt.peer -java.text.resources</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or even this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ japize as jdk11 explicitly
classes.zip +java, -java.awt.peer, -java.text.resources,</p>
