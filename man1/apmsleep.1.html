<p>APMSLEEP(1) APMSLEEP(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
apmsleep - go into suspend or standby mode and wake-up
later</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
apmsleep [-sSnwhVd] [--suspend] [--standby] [--noapm]
[--wait] [--precise] [--help] [--version] [--debug]
[+]hh:mm</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Some computers, especially laptops, can wake-up from a
low-power suspend to DRAM mode using the Real-time-clock
(RTC) chip. Apmsleep can be used to set the alarm time in
the RTC <br>
and to go into suspend or standby mode. An interrupt from
the RTC causes the computer to wake-up. The program detects
this event, by waiting for a leap in the kernel time and
<br>
terminates successfully. If no time leap occurs within one
minute, or something goes wrong, the exit value will be
non-zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The wake-up time can be
specified in two formats:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+hh:mm specifies a relative
offset to the current time. The computer will suspend for
exactly hh hours and mm minutes plus a few seconds to wake
up. On some laptops, the timing <br>
is not completely accurate so it may be a few minutes (or
more?) late.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hh:mm specifies absolute local
time in 24-hour format. The time stored in the RTC is not
important. You may change the time zone used, with the TZ
environment variable as usual. <br>
Daylight saving time is not obeyed in this version, but
might be in a future release. WARNING: Do not close cover of
laptop after suspending the laptop with apmsleep. Most
lap&acirc; <br>
tops overheat when running with closed cover.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Energy conservation with APM is
little for a desktop. Turning of the screen will save 1/2,
going into standby with drives turned off will save another
1/6th of the current.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
Print the apmsleep program version and exit immediately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --suspend <br>
Put the machine into suspend mode if possible (default). On
my laptop, suspend mode turns off everything except the
memory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S, --standby <br>
Put the machine into standby mode if possible. On my laptop,
standby mode turns off screen, hard disk, and CPU.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w, --wait <br>
Wait indefinitely for the time leap.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, --precise <br>
Wait for alarm time to match actual time. Do not wait for
time leap. This might be useful even without APM.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --noapm <br>
Do not call apm bios to suspend computer, just set the alarm
clock and wait for time leap indefinitely.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --debug <br>
Print some information about what is going on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REQUIRED SYSTEM CONFIGURATION
<br>
Kernel The special character device /dev/rtc must exist and
the kernel needs to be compiled with APM and RTC
support.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BIOS The computer must have the
&rsquo;suspend to RAM&rsquo; feature enabled in the BIOS;
&rsquo;suspend to Disk&rsquo; will not work, because the
computer is turned off completely. You do not need to <br>
enable the ALARM timer, it will be activated by apmsleep. On
some boards, you can configure which interrupts can be used
to awake from suspend mode. If you have such a <br>
board, you might want to make sure that keyboard (IRQ 1) and
RTC (IRQ 8) are among those interrupts. If your computer
does not wake up, try to enable &rsquo;modem ring&rsquo; in
the <br>
BIOS, even if you do not have a modem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Privileges <br>
The program must be run as root or have the SUID attribute
set (see chmod(1)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Apmsleep cannot detect which event terminated the
suspension. Possible events are: keyboard or mouse activity,
modem ring, alarm from RTC, any other interrupt. Sometimes,
the <br>
time leap is not detected properly (causing a wrong exit
value).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Should use APM BIOS calls to set
alarm clock (not yet supported by kernel).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This program was tested on a
Winbook XL laptop (Pentium) only. It may not function on
your hardware.</p>
